Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
These are hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
This week, the completely expected annual OLR intro has arrived. Ladies and gentlemen, E3 is here!

00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
But you knew that, so stay tuned!

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
You know how this works.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:37.000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.000 --> 00:46.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight, June the 11th of 2017, with episode number 690 of our show.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me on Twitter, at Skie, S-K-I-E.

00:50.000 --> 00:56.000
joined here in Studio N7, based out of Sacramento, California, with my co-host.

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
Not here just yet, but on her way, DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers. She's running a smidge behind tonight.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
But joining me here is Techmaster Loki.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
Hello.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Hi, Loki. How are you?

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
I'm fine.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
It's been a busy week. Here we are. It's E3 season.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Yeah.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Does it feel weird not being there?

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
No.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
Because we used to go.

01:12.000 --> 01:17.000
I think I went a few more times than you did, but you still went one of those years towards the end, right?

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
Yeah, it was 2009.

01:20.000 --> 01:27.000
Yeah. So, okay, so that was probably the last time you went. But now you're just, you're enjoying the whole watching-from-home thing and playing the home game, right?

01:27.000 --> 01:33.000
Yeah, I mean, I don't know. There's not really, I don't see the need to go anymore.

01:33.000 --> 01:42.000
Yeah. Yeah, I hear you. There's so much that's delivered through the, you know, Twitch and the now Mixer and the whole, you know, internet route that, you know,

01:42.000 --> 01:48.000
it just seems like you can almost cover more from home because those guys get the appointments so you don't have to, right?

01:48.000 --> 01:54.000
I'm going to be very interested to hear what it's like from the, you know, the fans. I'm using my Quiddie fingers that are actually there this year.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
I'll be very interested to see how it goes this year.

01:57.000 --> 02:06.000
All right. I do want to say, of course, we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern,

02:06.000 --> 02:11.000
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

02:11.000 --> 02:19.000
And we will get to your comments and stuff in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
And…

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
Who uses chat rooms anymore?

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
Hi, Jamie. How are you?

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
I'm okay.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
You showed up just in the nick of time.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
I'm hungry.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
I know. I know. So, you've had a busy day. Where are we at? We're doing a…

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
My hair's dead.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Oh, yeah. Your hair is all purple into blue. It's like…

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
It's actually two different shades of purple.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
Your hair could be a video game logo, but it's not.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
I look like a unicorn.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
A unicorn frappe. Yes. No, I'm kidding.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
Without the stabby forehead accessory.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
How do you feel not being at E3 this year? You used to go…

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
I don't care.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
I don't care.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
The luster's worn out for you?

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
Too many fucking people. I just don't care.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
Yeah.

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
You know, I'd rather, if I'm going to go to a big event, I'm going to go to a fun con instead.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
Go to a fan run thing?

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Yeah. I don't care.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
All right.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
Other people can do all that shit for me.

03:02.000 --> 03:07.000
I'll get what I want out of it without, you know, pieces of plastic I'm going to throw away five days later.

03:07.000 --> 03:14.000
Over at our chat, over at live.vognetwork.com, we've got Maya who says, hungry for E3 takes.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
Yes, I know you guys are. So, let's get to it.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
We've got a lot of ground to cover tonight.

03:19.000 --> 03:24.000
And we do have to end right at nine o'clock or a little bit before because we have a press conference at nine.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
I thought it was going to be in the middle of the show.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
Every other year they've done seven o'clock our time, but this year…

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
I think they moved it.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
We have a reprieve.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
Yeah, they bumped it back two hours for whatever.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
That's weird because that's midnight on the East Coast.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
That's late for those guys.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
It's the one time of year where the West Coast gets the advantage for a change.

03:40.000 --> 03:47.000
So, you know what? I'm sorry, East Coast, but you all get all those award shows that are broadcast live and not tape play.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
You get all that other stuff that's live and you get Saturday Night Live that's actually live.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
You know what? This is the one time where we get something.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
So, we're going to take it.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
All right. Let's get into it.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
E3. So, we had two big press conferences that have already happened.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Let's start with EA.

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
Admittedly, I did not watch this press conference because it was a terrible time, Saturday afternoon.

04:05.000 --> 04:10.000
I was busy with, ironically, another convention that has nothing to do with video gaming here locally.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
But, Loki, I know you watch.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
So, tell us a little bit about the EA event.

04:14.000 --> 04:19.000
So, they started off with, and I'm trying to remember because it was, you know…

04:19.000 --> 04:23.000
They had a lot of sports mixed in there, so I kind of tuned out during that stuff.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
But they started off, I want to say it was Battlefield 1.

04:26.000 --> 04:33.000
They were showing off the new DLC that they have coming out for that, which looks pretty cool.

04:33.000 --> 04:38.000
So, I mean, that'll be something that will be, I think it's later this summer or the fall.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
So, they're showing that.

04:41.000 --> 04:47.000
And then they talked a little bit about how they're going to be doing some esports related stuff with Battlefield.

04:47.000 --> 04:53.000
I'm not sure if it's tied into Battlefield 1 or if they're doing their own esports type game.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Excuse me.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
They were talking about making some new maps that were going to be a little bit smaller,

04:57.000 --> 05:03.000
so that maybe catered more towards those types of, that type of gameplay.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
And then they showed off, what was it?

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
They were talking about the, well, at the time it was the Xbox Scorpio.

05:10.000 --> 05:15.000
So, they were showing off some Madden stuff and like, hey, look, you can see the knee pads.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
And I was like, don't fucking care.

05:18.000 --> 05:23.000
But apparently, you know, if you really wanted to see up close, you know, the detail of the people.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
I mean, the details there.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
Sorry, the Google chat noise was the studio computer.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
Sorry, guys, I thought I'd turn that off.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
But it's not you.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
So, they have that.

05:31.000 --> 05:36.000
They showed off a little bit of the Need for Speed pay, I think it was Payback is what it's called.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
I don't remember the subtitle there.

05:38.000 --> 05:43.000
The new Need for Speed game that's basically, you know, Fast and the Furious type nonsense.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
So, they showed off a little bit of gameplay from that, which, I mean, it looks like,

05:46.000 --> 05:51.000
honestly, to me, it looks like Burnout, just like how they're doing the takedowns of cars and stuff.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
Like, that's Burnout, but whatever.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
I mean, I'm all down for that, I guess.

05:57.000 --> 06:02.000
They showed NBA Live, which I just kind of tuned out for.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
I don't believe they had NHL.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Oh, I do remember they had FIFA.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
And for some reason, I don't know why they do this.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
Maybe it's because I'm just not a fan of sports games.

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
But I think each year that they try to present FIFA,

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
it's awkward and cringey.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Like, it's just weird.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
Like, there's one year that they did an interview,

06:21.000 --> 06:27.000
and this year they had presenters, which I think are part of either a football

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
or, you know, in the FIFA realm here.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
And it was just really cheesy.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
FIFA is the biggest game in the world.

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
Well, I understand that, but the way they presented it was really cheesy.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
I lost interest very fast with it.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
I don't know.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
Was last year the year they did that whole, you are the FIFA?

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Oh, no, they didn't have that yet.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
They had, like, was it some fictional player's name where they say,

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
oh, yeah, even during the games, people are just wondering what's going on

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
with this fictional player.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
I'm like, I don't fucking care.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
Does really anybody do that?

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
I just don't believe that they would do that.

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
So that aside, sports, you know, glancing over that stuff aside,

07:05.000 --> 07:10.000
they did show, of course, the big one, which was Star Wars Battlefront II.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
And that looks fantastic.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
So they showed off, you know, kind of a trailer for it,

07:15.000 --> 07:19.000
kind of it's covering, you know, all three, you know, storylines.

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
And then, of course, they have their own individual storyline

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
that's with that as far as like an offline single player and stuff.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
And then they actually did demonstration of like an online multiplayer match.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
So they had like their first multiplayer teaser and stuff.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
And then they showed an actual match being played, which it looks pretty awesome.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
I'm a little more interested because they're single player.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
I don't know if that's a game I'll get right out the gate during the busy holiday season.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
Well, one of the other things that was pretty cool about it is they mentioned,

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
much like they did with Titanfall, all the DLC for it,

07:47.000 --> 07:51.000
which is they're going to have a whole season of DLC, is going to be free.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
So that's pretty nice.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
Some comments from our chat over at live.vog.network.com.

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
DCB Needle Crash in chat says, EA should just give up on NBA Live.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
Live hasn't been relevant since the 90s.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
And Act F says, Loki, the thing is that what they showed

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
is something that people that are into those types of games actually like,

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
which I think is kind of the FIFA stuff being referred to.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
Okay, so I get it. I get it.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
But like, do they really need to have like an interview with, was it Pele last year?

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
Do they really need to have an interview that takes up like ten minutes

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
of a presentation in the middle?

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
Pele is kind of a legend.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
I understand it, but you know what?

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
When you're talking about a conference where you can show off,

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
and they did have like games that they're talking about,

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
like these indie games that they're funding and stuff.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
When you have a conference that only has a finite amount of time,

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
and you waste ten minutes of that interview,

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
save that for a separate video that you can put out right after the conference.

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
I sort of follow you because, like not to jump ahead,

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
but the whole Porsche reveal at the Xbox thing was also kind of one of those

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
neat but wrong show.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
You know, this is E3. We're here to see games, not cars.

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
You know, and some people would read me up and down for that

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
because, you know, there's a lot of crossover, but I'm sorry.

09:03.000 --> 09:08.000
To me, that was, you know, a few minutes that was wasted from games

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
that were in a sizzle reel that I felt deserved a little more time.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
But I guess I'm getting ahead of myself. I apologize.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
But this just sounds like something similar is that the time management

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
sometimes feels weird.

09:18.000 --> 09:23.000
And you're like, I'm here to see video games, but Dark Soccer wants to.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Well, while she finishes chewing.

09:25.000 --> 09:29.000
But it was a pretty big deal when the Beatles came out on State.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
Well, obviously not all of them, but you know what I mean?

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
Those that are, you know, left. Exactly.

09:33.000 --> 09:37.000
Well, and I believe the estates of the others came out to do the rock band

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
Beatles that one year. That was a big deal.

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
So Pele to come out and it would be a big frickin deal.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
But it's pretty old now. A ten minute interview, I agree, is excessive.

09:46.000 --> 09:52.000
But anyway, however, a lot of those are tactics, not just for promotion,

09:52.000 --> 10:00.000
but for incomplete content or things they don't want to release too much about.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
So like a curtain. Exactly.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
A lot of times stuff like that is is a filler for a reason.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
I don't think I don't look in mirrors.

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
I don't agree with that only because before they had this last year,

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
of course, before they had that whole interview,

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
they they win the detail with all the things that they added to the FIFA.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
So they spend a good portion of time talking about the game.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
And then they did this interview on top of it as like a special treat.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
I see. It's like I get it. I get it.

10:25.000 --> 10:29.000
You know, people are excited about this player, but that's not really.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
This show is not a place for that.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
And much like, you know, the awkward banter that they were doing,

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
I get it. That's the characters that those guys play.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
As an outsider, I don't get it.

10:39.000 --> 10:43.000
And if you're trying to grow the audience for this, that's not a way to do it.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
It's just like this is really weird.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
Yes, but does the largest game in the world need to grow its audience?

10:48.000 --> 10:52.000
Yes. If you if you just give up on growing your audience, then what's the point?

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
Why release a new version each year then?

10:54.000 --> 10:58.000
Fair enough. OK, so it sounds like the good for you is Battlefront.

10:58.000 --> 11:03.000
The not so good for you. It sounds like some of the time management issues was a little bit like.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
It was just OK. It wasn't. They showed off a trailer for.

11:06.000 --> 11:11.000
But the publisher specific shows are not usually the big, big.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
You know what I mean? The publisher specific ones are usually.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
That's not necessarily true because prior to last year.

11:17.000 --> 11:23.000
And even maybe last year Ubisoft just had like the best show I thought, you know, or pretty good show.

11:23.000 --> 11:27.000
So, I mean, the publisher ones are still pretty important sometimes.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
They did show off a trailer for Anthem, a very brief trailer.

11:30.000 --> 11:36.000
And then they didn't really show anything because they're saying, OK, well, stay tuned for the Microsoft show because that's when we're going to show it off.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
You know, a little bit of, you know, spoiler there.

11:38.000 --> 11:43.000
But so there was that they mentioned as well as a new BioWare IP.

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
And then they had I could not remember what the EO.

11:46.000 --> 11:52.000
They had the new like funded by EA or what I forget the program's called.

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
But they have a game that was by the.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
The developer did a tale of two brothers.

11:58.000 --> 12:02.000
It's so they have like it's like a prison escape game.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
Yeah, I look kind of neat. So that was pretty cool.

12:05.000 --> 12:10.000
And then I think they had another game as well, but I can't remember what it was.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
Unfortunately, I didn't watch.

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
But I'm looking at the was it need for speed because I don't think I know.

12:15.000 --> 12:22.000
We I've talked about need for speed. Was it a way out the way out was the one that was the developer by the two brothers one.

12:22.000 --> 12:26.000
But got it. That is it's all on my notes.

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
I think that's it. Well, the EA access and origin access going free for a little bit.

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
Yeah. For a week. That's pretty cool. Yeah. To look into that. That's something there.

12:34.000 --> 12:38.000
So, yeah. And the folks in chatter echoing it was a way out was the name of that game.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
But I think we got that. So we're good. All right.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
Let's move on, though, because I definitely you know, EA is one thing.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
But obviously, Microsoft, something we've been really anticipating.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
And, you know, what is Scorpio and what is all this?

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
So let's just jump into Microsoft.

12:52.000 --> 12:57.000
And I don't necessarily want to go in order with every single thing they showed at the conference because there was a lot.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
But I want to just quickly just jump into the big question.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
Xbox one X is the new score is no longer Scorpio.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
It is Xbox one X, which some people have pointed out.

13:06.000 --> 13:13.000
There's a little bit of a cleverness to it because X box one X is an acronym for Xbox.

13:13.000 --> 13:18.000
You could look at it that way. Well, quickly, what about the name?

13:18.000 --> 13:23.000
Oh, actually, actually, one other thing I want to say before we really comment on anything, and this is important.

13:23.000 --> 13:27.000
I realize this whole E3 week sometimes can be like a great thing.

13:27.000 --> 13:38.000
It's like Christmas for gamers. And it can also be like a really like it can be a really hard time of year because it feels like there's so many people that just want to take it as an excuse to be the most cynical fucking gamer in the world.

13:38.000 --> 13:45.000
And I just want to point out, sometimes we are critical about game companies here on OLR. Lord knows, Loki's had a share of Nintendo things.

13:45.000 --> 13:49.000
But even when it comes to Nintendo, like there's good and there's bad.

13:49.000 --> 13:54.000
And I think you can be a fan of video games, but always challenge what can be done better.

13:54.000 --> 13:59.000
And I think if there's any critic out there that's 100 percent positive, that's probably dipping into fanboy a little bit.

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
If there's anybody that's 100 percent negative, well, that's just somebody cynical.

14:03.000 --> 14:08.000
And I would ask, what is that bringing to gaming? Is that person even a gaming fan if they're just 100 percent negative all the time?

14:08.000 --> 14:15.000
So I just want to kind of get that out is that I think it's important here where every gamer has a voice that we look at both the positive and the negative.

14:15.000 --> 14:20.000
Because I think with Microsoft today, I'm definitely feeling both. There are some things I'm like really, really happy about.

14:20.000 --> 14:25.000
There's some things where I'm not feeling so good about. And I think Microsoft, I don't know. I don't know.

14:25.000 --> 14:30.000
But let's start with this. What about that name? Xbox One X. Loki?

14:30.000 --> 14:41.000
I think it's just confusing. I mean, especially to me, being that it's just one letter off from the Xbox One S, both the S and X sound kind of similar.

14:41.000 --> 14:50.000
And you're talking about, let's just say, the everyday mom and pop going in and buying their son or daughter a system.

14:50.000 --> 14:57.000
And the systems look identical. It's going to be confusing aside from the price point and someone explaining to them what the difference is.

14:57.000 --> 15:07.000
I thought Bobby had a hilarious comparison at the opening of his show tonight. Bobby Black Wolf, our pal here at VOG, had mentioned it was like the Tesla models.

15:07.000 --> 15:15.000
You have a Tesla Model S and a Tesla Model X. And it's really funny because you kind of have the same thing going on with the Xboxes at this point.

15:15.000 --> 15:22.000
I just thought that was funny. You're right. S and X sound. Now we just need an Xbox One E.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
But you know what? We have the elite controllers. There you go. Sex.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
Dark Sakura? I don't know. You probably didn't...

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
I don't see how someone would make that error when asking for one.

15:34.000 --> 15:41.000
These are the same people, though, that confuse the Wii U for an accessory for the Wii. So I'm giving them no benefit.

15:42.000 --> 15:52.000
As I was saying, I think, though, that the average person is going to go in with at least staff working there that will say, what do you mean, this or this?

15:52.000 --> 15:56.000
And show them the difference. That's what they're trained to do.

15:56.000 --> 16:04.000
Although I do think the S and X is a little confusing, I actually don't hate the name. I think it's fine.

16:04.000 --> 16:18.000
Because what I like about it is that unlike Wii, see, there's a big difference here between Wii U and Wii and Xbox X and Xbox S, is that the Xbox One is meant to be one ecosystem.

16:18.000 --> 16:25.000
Wii and Wii U were separate things. I mean, yes, the Wii U played Wii games, but we all know that was kind of a struggle for Nintendo throughout the life of the Wii U.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
But let me get away from Nintendo because this isn't about them.

16:28.000 --> 16:34.000
But the Xbox One S and Xbox One X, the thing that I like about that is that it kind of emphasizes that it's one ecosystem.

16:34.000 --> 16:40.000
So it's like you can go with the S model that does, it plays the games, but it's, you know, it's only 1080 and da-da-da-da-da.

16:40.000 --> 16:44.000
Or you can go with the X that's going to be more expensive, but it does 4K and da-da-da-da.

16:44.000 --> 16:49.000
So the thing I like about it is that it does emphasize it's still one ecosystem.

16:50.000 --> 16:55.000
Because I still think there's some people out there that for some reason didn't get the memo when Microsoft said,

16:55.000 --> 17:01.000
all of these games that come out on, using my quoted fingers, Scorpio, are going to work on Xbox One.

17:01.000 --> 17:09.000
This is not a new system. It is a new way to play the games that are already out there. Loki?

17:09.000 --> 17:15.000
I don't buy that. You know why I don't buy that? Because history has shown otherwise.

17:15.000 --> 17:22.000
You have like a company like Nintendo, for example, that they'll have games like that be like on the 3DS or the new 3DS or something like that.

17:22.000 --> 17:28.000
And all of a sudden it's like, oh yeah, I'll play both these games. And then, oh wait, no, now it's only exclusive to this platform.

17:28.000 --> 17:34.000
I see in a couple years, to be fair, that was like two games for Nintendo.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
But I see in a couple years easily that they'll go back on that word.

17:37.000 --> 17:41.000
And I'm not saying that, I'm not blaming Microsoft at all. Sony will do the same shit.

17:42.000 --> 17:48.000
So both of them are going to go back on that and they're going to only, because they got to keep pushing that graphic fidelity and they're going to keep doing it.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
But isn't that kind of what we expect though?

17:51.000 --> 17:57.000
But then don't fucking come out and lie about it then. I mean, I understand right now they will do that.

17:57.000 --> 18:04.000
I mean, whatever. I mean, they have to push both platforms. So obviously they're going to say that it's going to always do that.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
But I don't believe in always.

18:06.000 --> 18:12.000
Speaking of Sony, did you catch the little dig at them with the whole, and this does 4K Blu-ray?

18:12.000 --> 18:18.000
Yeah, and I'm, they should. Because there's no reason their system should not do that.

18:18.000 --> 18:25.000
Okay, alright, fair enough. So, let me ask you this. Were you sold on an Xbox One X, why or why not?

18:25.000 --> 18:30.000
And I opened this up to chat too, because I want to see some of your comments. Were you sold on an Xbox One X today, why or why not?

18:30.000 --> 18:36.000
No, I'm not. Because I have a PC that can run PC games. And guess what?

18:36.000 --> 18:42.000
Every year it's like, what exclusive games are you going to have for this system that's going to sell this system for me?

18:42.000 --> 18:50.000
And guess what? All of those games are on PC. So why am I going to drop, with a $4.99, which was the price point for it,

18:50.000 --> 18:54.000
why am I going to drop $4.99 for this when I have a PC that can run these games?

18:55.000 --> 19:02.000
There's no reason for me to do that. I don't own a 4K TV. No reason for me to invest $500 in that and not have a TV to play it on.

19:02.000 --> 19:11.000
Yeah, oh yeah, it enhances 1080p games. But you know what? Who cares? I have a 1080p screen on my computer and I'm fine with just playing with that.

19:11.000 --> 19:21.000
I don't need to play it 4K, but also like Crackdown, which is a game I'm looking forward to, it's not going to sell me the system because I can play that on my PC.

19:21.000 --> 19:28.000
Some comments in chat. YYR says, if the price was $3.99, I would have grabbed it day one. At $4.99, I might wait.

19:28.000 --> 19:36.000
DCB Needle Crash says, I'm not really sold on it. 4K 60 frames a second can be achieved on PC. I have a PC that can do it, minus the 4K monitors.

19:36.000 --> 19:45.000
Zeba says, I was sold on it, but then they said the price, it's too much in my opinion. JD says, simply no because I don't buy Xboxes.

19:45.000 --> 19:53.000
Dark Soccer, I know you didn't get to see, or at least I don't think you saw the Microsoft thing today because you were doing other errands, but your household doesn't have an Xbox One at all, right?

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
Nope, but it's not going to.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
So this didn't sell you on it?

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
No.

19:56.000 --> 20:04.000
Because I would think that maybe for people who waited and don't have an Xbox yet, maybe the Xbox One X could be that thing.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
It might be. I think it needs to come down to price. I think the price point's too high.

20:08.000 --> 20:23.000
Well, I mean, in answering your question, I have a PC. I have a Mac. I have a Linux computer. I have so many choices on what to play my games on that none of that matters to me.

20:23.000 --> 20:31.000
I have a PS4. I have a Wii U. I don't care about the Switch yet, except I kind of want to play ARMS, but that's about it.

20:31.000 --> 20:36.000
It's slowly winning you. Nintendo's thing Tuesday night.

20:36.000 --> 20:54.000
Well, it wasn't that there was anything to win. I was just indifferent, you know, and I'm still a little indifferent. I have Therians I could play theirs, but I don't see anything that's making it worth me putting a fiscal consideration into it. Does that make sense? It's not worth the money yet.

20:55.000 --> 21:03.000
To piggyback on that, because I definitely have a thought that's similar to you guys, is that I think probably the biggest minus I can put in Microsoft.

21:03.000 --> 21:09.000
Well, here, I'm going to give you a big plus, and I'm going to give you a big minus right after the fact from Microsoft's thing today.

21:09.000 --> 21:16.000
The big plus was I was not expecting to be sold on 4K gaming because I don't have a 4K television yet.

21:17.000 --> 21:27.000
But when they were showing Forza, when they were showing Anthem, and some of those games they were showing today, I was like, fuck, these games are gorgeous, even though I'm watching it on a 1080p downgrade.

21:27.000 --> 21:37.000
I'm like, I can only imagine what this would probably look like on an actual 4K TV. So, I would say, in a way, Microsoft really made me fucking pay attention to 4K gaming today.

21:37.000 --> 21:43.000
I was going into it thinking, it's too soon. It's way too soon for 4K gaming. Microsoft's going to shoot themselves in the foot with this.

21:43.000 --> 21:57.000
That's what they should do if they're smart. If they're smart, come holiday, when this is out, and they have all those retail set ups running these really nice 4K TVs, partner with a company that manufactures those to knock off some of the price of the system.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
Or one of those specialty stores in Best Buy or something.

21:59.000 --> 22:07.000
Yeah, like a Best Buy. So, I'm saying that knocks off the price of the system like 100 bucks or something like that if you purchase a 4K TV, because that's going to not only sell the 4K TV, but that'll sell the system.

22:07.000 --> 22:11.000
Did you want to jump in here before I get to my negative? Oh, I thought you were trying to say something.

22:11.000 --> 22:32.000
No, I'm just sitting here thinking, I have a 4K TV. I've played games on a 4K, actually on a 5K Retina Mac. I think that it would be pretty, but I was just thinking about first person shooters and how nauseous I would get.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
Too much overload.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
I got really nauseous playing.

22:36.000 --> 22:42.000
At some point, I know you're a BioWare fangirl, I really want to get your take on the Anthem footage at some point.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
I'd have to take time to watch it.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
I know, I know. It doesn't take that long.

22:46.000 --> 22:53.000
I'll be honest, I didn't care to look at it, because I'm still kind of peeved over what they did with Mass Effect Andromeda.

22:53.000 --> 22:57.000
They sold Mass Effect up the river to make Anthem.

22:57.000 --> 23:01.000
We know why Mass Effect Andromeda is the way it is now, because of what they did with this game.

23:02.000 --> 23:08.000
I would have rather that the tension went to Mass Effect Andromeda. So I'm a little bitter and I don't care.

23:08.000 --> 23:18.000
Well, I think in some way you should watch it so you can have a little more basis on what you're going back and forth on, but that's just my opinion.

23:18.000 --> 23:24.000
Because Anthem was third person, so I feel like it might not be as bad for a lot of those things.

23:24.000 --> 23:31.000
With Anthem, and I guess I'm getting a little ahead of myself, we didn't see story from Anthem.

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
When it comes to BioWare, a lot of us think of story.

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
When Alan was watching it with me, he kind of made that point.

23:37.000 --> 23:40.000
With BioWare, I expect story. This is giving me none of that.

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
But for me, when I was watching that gameplay, I was like, this is hot.

23:43.000 --> 23:47.000
This is Mass Effect multiplayer, which I love, but in a huge world.

23:47.000 --> 23:51.000
So I'm like, I could get down with this, but I want to see more.

23:51.000 --> 23:54.000
But anyway, I'm digressing a little bit. So I gave my positive, or my plus.

23:54.000 --> 23:59.000
My plus is, Microsoft convinced me 4K gaming could be the future today.

23:59.000 --> 24:04.000
Here's the negative. I was not convinced I need an Xbox One X to do it.

24:04.000 --> 24:11.000
Because walking away from my TV or whatever, leaving that press conference, I was like, I need to upgrade my computer.

24:11.000 --> 24:20.000
I need to upgrade my computer from what it is now to be able to support 4K gaming, which is something I was already on the fence with.

24:20.000 --> 24:26.000
But every single one of those things they showed today, they were saying it was Windows 10 as well as the Xbox.

24:26.000 --> 24:39.000
So there's nothing that is specific to consoles. It is only the Xbox ecosystem, if you will.

24:39.000 --> 24:44.000
Yeah, it's really just third parties. I don't know.

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
I mean, that's even what it was like last year.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
And let's just step back for a second here.

24:51.000 --> 24:58.000
Microsoft really overuses the word exclusive for stuff that's not quite exclusive.

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
I mean, eh.

25:01.000 --> 25:05.000
It's more like they had an exclusive trailer for a game that's coming to multiple systems.

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
It's like World Premiere. It's like, dude, what the fuck is this shit?

25:08.000 --> 25:13.000
I mean, like, I get it. You're trying to say you have all these exclusive titles, but they're not really exclusive.

25:13.000 --> 25:22.000
They're like, it's out first on Xbox, or we have the console exclusive for this game that's been out on PC already, or I don't know.

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
They're overusing it.

25:25.000 --> 25:29.000
I want to go from some comments in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

25:29.000 --> 25:33.000
Some people commenting on Anthem. Ziba says, Anthem looks beautiful.

25:33.000 --> 25:37.000
Bobby Blackwell says, I'm glad the attention went to a new IP.

25:37.000 --> 25:41.000
We keep crying for new IPs, but then we bitch when they make new IPs.

25:41.000 --> 25:45.000
And then, let's see, other comments in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

25:45.000 --> 25:50.000
Tigerclaw says, BioWare's A-Team was spending more time on Anthem than they were with Mass Effect Andromeda.

25:50.000 --> 25:58.000
Yeah, and that's, I mean, I can understand why as a Mass Effect fan that can be a little bit of a, wow, I got screwed in this equation.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
I'm watching this gameplay and it's just pissing me off.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
But even like...

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
I'm sorry, I'm not understanding. Why? Why is it pissing you off?

26:05.000 --> 26:10.000
Because I would have rather the attention go into Mass Effect. Mass Effect could have been this.

26:10.000 --> 26:15.000
But here's the thing though, like Mass Effect never drew me into it. This looks awesome. Like this I'd want to play.

26:15.000 --> 26:21.000
So interesting. Interesting. I don't know. I mean, it's just, this is one of those cases where everybody has different opinions. I don't know.

26:21.000 --> 26:29.000
All right. SSG100Matt in chat says, each segment on OLR should have the exclusive tag before it starts.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
Windows 10 and Xbox One exclusive.

26:31.000 --> 26:35.000
I've heard some, I've heard some podcasts that do it and it gets old, trust me.

26:35.000 --> 26:50.000
And Square, I mean Square Enix, come on. What is up with episodic everything, dude? Like the Life is Strange prequels episode, episodic thing. I mean, that's kind of annoying.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
It's probably a full game.

26:52.000 --> 27:02.000
Well, but yeah, but some people, I mean, that was the highlight of the whole day in convention or the whole dang show for some people was the fact that they're doing that prequel to Life is Strange.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
I don't know.

27:04.000 --> 27:08.000
Here's the other thing too, is that people are comparing it to Destiny and I don't like Destiny.

27:08.000 --> 27:17.000
I don't think, I wasn't getting the Destiny vibe from it. I'm just not, somebody like two weeks ago said it was going to be BioWare's Destiny and one of those things.

27:17.000 --> 27:25.000
And now everybody is saying it's BioWare's Destiny. And I'm like, I didn't get that read from, because Destiny reminds me of Halo.

27:25.000 --> 27:28.000
It doesn't remind me of, of what I saw, but that's me.

27:28.000 --> 27:31.000
I also hate Halo.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
But I'm saying Anthem looks nothing like it to me.

27:35.000 --> 27:42.000
Now that we've, we've had time to digest some of the footage from Anthem, how the fuck am I going to fuck people in that suit is what I want to know.

27:42.000 --> 27:47.000
I mean, like, is it built for that? I mean, is that even a thing? I can't figure out how that's going to work.

27:47.000 --> 27:50.000
No, no, no. In Anthem, in Anthem's suit, fuck you.

27:50.000 --> 27:54.000
Am I going to like get a flying start in somebody? I mean, like, how's that going to work?

27:54.000 --> 27:58.000
They've got a flashlight built in or, you know, the reverse for ladies.

27:58.000 --> 28:04.000
All right. Tiger Claw says Anthem was giving me an Iron Man vibe because of the armor with the jetpack.

28:04.000 --> 28:10.000
It looked pretty cool. Now, in some of the other stuff that they're showing off, Sea of Thieves spent way too much time on that shit.

28:10.000 --> 28:18.000
Spent way too much time on Sea of Thieves. But I mean, it looked, you know, Rare is one of their people that's pumping them new IPs.

28:18.000 --> 28:23.000
And so that's cool. And there were things about the game that I liked, but you know, okay, here's the thing with Sea of Thieves.

28:23.000 --> 28:28.000
What they showed at the press conference, I was like, okay, whatever. And then I'm like, wow, this is going on a long time.

28:28.000 --> 28:33.000
Still going, still going. It's trying to be self-referential and cute and have that Rare wit. Okay, whatever.

28:33.000 --> 28:38.000
But here's the thing. After the conference was over, if you went back onto Mixer on their Xbox channel,

28:38.000 --> 28:42.000
they were doing some type of Sea of Thieves reveal or, you know, first look.

28:42.000 --> 28:50.000
And they were using that Mixer thing that actually had four people playing it at once for the developers.

28:50.000 --> 28:58.000
And they were just playing the game for real and talking to each other. And I was like, this sells me more on the game than what they showed in that thing that they showed on stage.

28:58.000 --> 29:02.000
And it also is selling the benefits of Mixer. Missed opportunity, in my opinion.

29:02.000 --> 29:09.000
And also, I'd rather see, I mean, don't get me wrong, the cheesy pirate dialogue was kind of funny for the little trailer.

29:09.000 --> 29:14.000
The year before was really cringey with the fake, you know, chit chat stuff.

29:14.000 --> 29:23.000
I'd rather see, like, developers just kind of talking about their game and just idly chit chatting and stuff over it instead of all this fake bullshit that they added in there.

29:23.000 --> 29:31.000
And to be fair, Anthem had that shit too. I mean, they had the fake chit chat over, you know, for multiplayer that kind of annoyed me.

29:31.000 --> 29:38.000
Terry Crews and Crackdown. I'm on board. I was on board Crackdown already. Terry Crews added to it. Yes, I'll buy it twice.

29:39.000 --> 29:44.000
Yeah, that whole reveal was pretty good. And it's got such a Tron look to it, which, you know, I live for.

29:44.000 --> 29:54.000
I'm a little worried because I don't see all that destruction that was promised before. Remember, the cloud was going to make all this destruction happen or something like that.

29:54.000 --> 30:06.000
I'd not seen that in the trailer anymore. So, I don't know if that's been omitted from it or not, because it was quite brief, aside from Terry Crews being there, which I'm fine with.

30:07.000 --> 30:12.000
I don't know. Or if that's still going to be like online only, because they were saying that online was going to have that originally.

30:12.000 --> 30:20.000
Bummer that that means he was probably too busy to do Doomfist for all the people that were hoping for that on the Blizzard front, is that now he's in Crackdown 3.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
But at least he got in a video game somewhere.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
I don't think he was. It's just voice.

30:23.000 --> 30:34.000
That's true. That's true. Voice actors can do lots and lots of games. And it missed our show tonight, but somebody posted a thing on my Facebook that says that with that whole strike thing, they are going back to the table for more talks.

30:34.000 --> 30:40.000
So that's a good thing that maybe there's going to be resolution on that whole front while E3 is going on. But anyway, I digress.

30:40.000 --> 30:49.000
Yes, I was excited about Crackdown 3 as well. I was almost surprised that that didn't get as much time as some of the other things they spent a lot of time on.

30:49.000 --> 30:56.000
For me, they spent way too much time on that Shadows of War. Was that what it's called? The Shadows of Mordor game, basically.

30:56.000 --> 30:59.000
It looks cool. I like the way they spent a long time.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
But they spent way too much time on something that's not an exclusive.

31:01.000 --> 31:06.000
Well, they did the same thing with Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed Origins.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
Yeah, that's true.

31:08.000 --> 31:11.000
With my UAV Hawk.

31:11.000 --> 31:24.000
See, I'm not usually into Assassin's Creed games. I'm not. But I was excited to see that. That in particular was a good little feature that they did because it finally allowed me to see this is what actual gameplay looks like in 4K.

31:24.000 --> 31:30.000
Or at least in the alpha footage because we all know that sometimes games don't look like what they look like on the E3 stage.

31:30.000 --> 31:36.000
But at least it still gives you a sense like this is what the game is intended to actually look like when you're playing it. And we were getting that from Assassin's Creed.

31:36.000 --> 31:49.000
And remember my hope out of E3 was those wow moments like, wow, you know, I was not expecting this. Metro Exodus, I think, was that wow moment for me because I wasn't really familiar with Metro until I had the review last light.

31:50.000 --> 31:57.000
And so I got to play through it and I really liked it. I know you hate kind of like a lot of the first person shooters, but this is more of like a story driven first person shooter.

31:57.000 --> 32:02.000
I'd say it's more like a Bioshock or like actually Bioshock is pretty good.

32:02.000 --> 32:08.000
I don't I don't hate all the first person shooters, but I'm not a big fan of jump scares. And doesn't this game kind of use a lot of those?

32:08.000 --> 32:16.000
It's not so bad. It's just like, I mean, Bioshock does the same thing. It's kind of similar to that. It's got it's not entirely jump scares. There are some of those.

32:16.000 --> 32:25.000
It looked nice for what it was. I mean, I'm not I'm not going to lie. You know, I you know, and it's like I said, I I don't like to always take the cynical gamer perspective.

32:25.000 --> 32:32.000
Yes, there are some things I get irritated about, but I feel like I can sit there and go like with Assassin's Creed, I can sit there and go, you know, I'm probably not going to buy this game.

32:32.000 --> 32:38.000
This is usually a series I get into, but this looks nice. And I bet some people are really into this. And this is a good thing for Microsoft right now.

32:38.000 --> 32:47.000
So, you know, I and that's I had a similar take with the Metro as I was like, OK, for people that are into this, this looks really hot in 4K.

32:47.000 --> 32:54.000
But I don't know if this will be something I buy day one, but you never know. Sometimes I find new things I don't expect I'm going to buy.

32:54.000 --> 33:03.000
Now, one of the things that they didn't spend a whole lot of time on was talking about some of those in Xbox indie stuff like the idea of Xbox games.

33:03.000 --> 33:11.000
That went way too fast for me. I was really upset with that because there was stuff in there I wanted to know more about. There was a freaking Fable card game in there.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
And I was like, what? Yeah. Is that like Hearthstone?

33:13.000 --> 33:23.000
Yeah, that's supposed to be coming out soon. The last night was that one that was all kind of Sprite is the whole, you know, was it Cyberpunk Sprite looking game?

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
Mm hmm. That looks pretty similar.

33:25.000 --> 33:31.000
Something Devolver Digital would have usually be putting out. But yeah, I got it. Yeah, that was interesting.

33:31.000 --> 33:38.000
Let's see. Oh, oh, I got to mention one that got me excited. The sequel to Ori. Because Ori and the Blind Forest, beautiful game.

33:38.000 --> 33:46.000
It's Metroid-esque, but I hate calling it that because it makes you think it's Metroid. It's not, but it's, you know, that whole type of like type of game.

33:46.000 --> 33:52.000
But Ori is beautiful. If you haven't played it, you know, give it a shot. I must confess, I haven't beaten it, but I've spent a good chunk of time with it and I really enjoy it.

33:52.000 --> 33:59.000
So when they announced the sequel, which I think had been leaked a couple days prior, I was really excited to hear that they are continuing on with it.

33:59.000 --> 34:06.000
And that they kind of featured it as much as they did. Usually games like that for Microsoft are kind of a, oh, and this too, that's it.

34:06.000 --> 34:12.000
You know, kind of like what they did with Cuphead. But people were pointing out to me that Cuphead, they've been teasing for years.

34:12.000 --> 34:19.000
And now finally, so I kind of get it in that regard. But like when I was seeing the Cuphead footage, I was like, fuck, this game looks hot.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
I am so looking forward to Cuphead.

34:21.000 --> 34:28.000
And don't let them confuse you into believing that you can only get that shit on the Windows 10 store. It's on fucking Steam. Do not buy it on the Windows 10 store.

34:28.000 --> 34:31.000
Don't buy anything on the Windows 10 store if you can avoid it.

34:31.000 --> 34:38.000
Well, to be fair, didn't they say it was Xbox Anywhere? So if you bought it on the Windows 10 store, you would also have the Xbox One version.

34:38.000 --> 34:47.000
So that might sell some people on it. Some people may not care about that. But see, for me, I'm sorry, I find that Steam isn't going to put it on a console for me.

34:47.000 --> 34:55.000
Except my Steam Box. But that thing, those Steam Boxes don't wear well. They don't. They don't handle well. Anyway.

34:55.000 --> 35:02.000
Okay, so let's see. Going to, just a couple other things I want to point out.

35:02.000 --> 35:09.000
Okay, this is one that got a lot of people going, ooh, Minecraft. Because one of the things they announced is that Minecraft is going to 4K.

35:09.000 --> 35:19.000
And of course, Twitter, when I think 4K, I think of Minecraft. I have to admit, I liked what they show. I mean, it didn't make me go like, oh my god.

35:19.000 --> 35:26.000
But I was like, neat, it's a free update. And these graphics, yeah, they look cool. For keeping the Minecraft aesthetic. I was so happy with it.

35:26.000 --> 35:32.000
I've been saying that they should be doing some of the custom shaders that they have out there and stuff.

35:33.000 --> 35:39.000
Because I was like, well, they've got all this power that's in these consoles. You can't tell me that they can't upgrade the way Minecraft looks.

35:39.000 --> 35:46.000
I get it, you keep everything looking blocky as it is. But there's still some pretty nice shaders out there, like Sonic Ether's unbelievable shaders.

35:46.000 --> 35:52.000
And they have a lot of other ones that are kind of similar type stuff, where they change the quality of the water.

35:52.000 --> 35:57.000
And they change some of the foliage and the lighting and everything. And it kind of looks like that's what this is.

35:58.000 --> 36:02.000
Except the ones that have been out for several years still look better than this.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
So you're basically saying modders did it better.

36:04.000 --> 36:12.000
Modders did it better already, and I'm like, come on. It's only a little bit more that they gotta push it to make it look nice.

36:12.000 --> 36:20.000
And it's alright, I guess, but it could be just so much better with just a tiny bit more effort put in.

36:20.000 --> 36:27.000
But to be fair, the other thing they announced, I know you're a little more hyped about, and that's the fact that now there's going to be cross-play on everything, basically.

36:27.000 --> 36:37.000
Yeah, they were talking about that before, how they were going to do that. And before it was just Android, iOS, and VR, and the Windows 10 version, which I think works right now.

36:37.000 --> 36:44.000
But now it's also going to include the Xbox One, I'm assuming the Switch.

36:44.000 --> 36:53.000
And I don't know if the Xbox 360 is going to do it as well, but I know the Xbox One. I think it's all the newer gen ones, because I don't think the Wii U...

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
But not PlayStation 4.

36:55.000 --> 36:58.000
No, not PlayStation 4, because...

36:58.000 --> 37:03.000
They couldn't work it out. But obviously there's a Sony-Microsoft conflict there.

37:03.000 --> 37:11.000
But I'm sorry, but that was somewhat powerful to me, to see a Nintendo Switch of sorts at Microsoft's conference.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
I give them props for that.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
That was very interesting to me, to see that.

37:15.000 --> 37:19.000
It is. And that's more power to it.

37:19.000 --> 37:28.000
And for those who don't know what I'm referring to, it wasn't the device itself, but it was a mock-up one made out of blocks. There was no mistake, it was a Nintendo Switch with the blue and red controllers in the Minecraft world.

37:28.000 --> 37:34.000
And for a company to show even a picture of another company's product like that, I thought was kind of a big deal.

37:34.000 --> 37:42.000
And they basically said they have the marketplace coming, which is supposed to be mod-supporting, so it's user-created skins and tile packs that they're going to have.

37:42.000 --> 37:54.000
The thing I don't necessarily like about it, I guess it's alright, but they can sell skins, so they don't have to necessarily be free, so you can buy that.

37:54.000 --> 38:03.000
So you can say, oh, they're going to add microtransactions to it, but then again they have skins that are being sold now that they sell from Microsoft, so I guess it's not a huge deal.

38:03.000 --> 38:18.000
But the fact that they're doing the cross-platform play is pretty awesome. They're doing the Realm stuff, which they're going to basically allow you to have your own server that can work across all these different platforms, which is pretty cool.

38:18.000 --> 38:27.000
I wish they had free options for that, but whatever, I guess that's the limitations you have with this process. So that's all good stuff.

38:27.000 --> 38:34.000
Stoppy in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, I wonder if that's a sign that they are cutting PlayStation 4 support completely. That's it.

38:34.000 --> 38:40.000
No, I don't think that they're cutting support for the PlayStation 4. I think it's just Sony is just not playing nice.

38:40.000 --> 38:44.000
So there could be a thing with PlayStation Network and that whole thing.

38:44.000 --> 38:55.000
It's not surprising. I think it's more like the Nintendo Switch is surprising, whereas the PlayStation is not. Does that make sense?

38:55.000 --> 39:05.000
I would have fully expected that it's only Windows 10 to Xbox to tablets and that's it. The fact that Nintendo is involved is a surprise in a way. Anyway.

39:05.000 --> 39:11.000
And then of course the console. But I think it's pretty awesome. Oh, and VR, but that's such a small portion of it.

39:11.000 --> 39:17.000
Well, let's just hit on a couple other quick things, and then I do want to move on for the sake of time. We still have a lot of news that didn't even come out from these conferences.

39:17.000 --> 39:25.000
But there are a couple of big things at the conference I want to touch on. One of them, you just mentioned a little bit, VR, or in this case, lack thereof.

39:25.000 --> 39:31.000
Surprised at all that Microsoft did not touch VR, AR, any of it.

39:31.000 --> 39:42.000
I don't think it's ready yet, which is weird. I don't know. Maybe that's a tough thing right there, because if they're talking all this one ecosystem thing, are they going to be able to push that?

39:42.000 --> 39:48.000
If they were going to put out VR for Xbox One, I don't think they have really enough yet to show for that.

39:48.000 --> 39:59.000
That's why I think they're taking the safe route with 4K gaming, because at least they know 4K is kind of a technology that's being adopted a little bit quicker than say VR right now or VR AR.

39:59.000 --> 40:09.000
So it's probably more of a safe bet. Not that they'll say they can't do that later on with the power that they have in the Xbox One X, but it's probably a little bit too early to show off anything, or too much of a gamble.

40:09.000 --> 40:19.000
Yeah. Well, maybe, especially since the hardware they're pushing this year is Xbox One X, they really wanted to say, you need 4K games, and they just wanted to focus on that message today.

40:19.000 --> 40:27.000
And I don't fault them for that. If the HoloLens concept or whatever isn't ready for consumers, then it's not the time to show it. Let that bake another year, that's fine.

40:27.000 --> 40:44.000
Really, when you think about it, with VR and what they probably would implement, they don't have a camera really. It's going to be weird if they said, oh yeah, we're going to have you buy a camera, connect, and then it would work with this VR headset.

40:44.000 --> 40:54.000
And that just seems weird. I know that they have tech now that actually uses the actual headset as the camera to read the room and everything, but I think it's just too early for them to announce anything.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
And like I said, this is probably the safer route to go.

40:59.000 --> 41:05.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Laundry Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, taxi.

41:05.000 --> 41:18.000
And one more thing I'll mention about this conference, then we're going to move on to our gaming weeks, but I think this was the thing that nobody thought would be announced, and was kind of the big surprise, original Xbox compatibility.

41:18.000 --> 41:27.000
And it's funny because we're coming off of this whole, oh, Alan's here and he brought me a frappuccino, what a nice boy, thank you so much.

41:27.000 --> 41:36.000
Wow, so this is vanilla with a thank you. That was worth interrupting the show for. Thank you, Alan, I really appreciate that.

41:36.000 --> 41:40.000
Okay, did you bring enough for the whole class? I'm just kidding. Alright, sorry guys.

41:40.000 --> 41:54.000
Alright, anyway, so Xbox original system compatibility. I don't think anybody was expecting that, but very interesting the fact that it's the same week that there's been a lot in the news, you know, ours, or one of those, was it ours?

41:54.000 --> 41:55.000
Yeah, ours said it.

41:55.000 --> 42:05.000
Did their own type of investigation and Microsoft's really kind of pushed back and said, you're wrong, basically without being so harsh about it, they're just basically saying the way you analyze this was not right.

42:05.000 --> 42:10.000
I would probably trust a platform holder that can actually see those statistics versus like an independent.

42:10.000 --> 42:19.000
Well, here it is, all that talk at the end of the day, Microsoft believed in it enough to double down on it by saying, and now here is original Xbox support.

42:19.000 --> 42:23.000
That to me is much more powerful than the he said, she said of the numbers game.

42:23.000 --> 42:35.000
Exactly. I mean, like, think about it. That's like, that's definitely uncalled for. No one really expected that or even necessarily was demanding that it was just something that, Hey, we can do this.

42:35.000 --> 42:51.000
So, but that being said, will you, you, well, you don't own an Xbox one, so I guess maybe you're the wrong person. Would this mean that Xbox games could work on PC? I guess not. Cause I know I'm still don't, I would be awesome, but no, I, I, I'm curious to see what games they support.

42:51.000 --> 43:10.000
I still have most of my games from original Xbox, like halo one and halo two, uh, DDR universe. Although what I expect is going to happen is that, and this sounds silly, but I expect it's going to be the Xbox emulator on 360 emulated through Xbox 360 emulation emulator of an emulator.

43:10.000 --> 43:15.000
I mean, why not? That makes sense, right? Couldn't Microsoft just do that?

43:16.000 --> 43:31.000
I don't know if that would be the way they do that. Maybe they have a better way of doing it now. Um, the other thing I was going to mention too, one of the caveats of that is, um, they were saying that with that system link is going to be working across all three generations.

43:31.000 --> 43:42.000
So like, say you wanted to bring out your Xbox one with halo two running on it, you can play that against an original Xbox. Oh, snap. That's pretty cool. Yeah. So that's pretty neat. Wow. That's great.

43:42.000 --> 43:52.000
That's great. So, so go, well, that's because I guess the architecture of Xbox live hasn't changed drastically since the original Xbox. Well, yeah, it's all system link is without Xbox live as well.

43:52.000 --> 44:04.000
So, I mean, it's probably, it kind of makes sense that it would work. Crackdown was one of those games that support system link. Well, that's great. I hope, I hope even the, the streaming stuff works with the original Xbox games and all the stuff they built into 360 games.

44:04.000 --> 44:18.000
That would be rad, especially for a retro game fan like me. I'm really excited about that. All right, so there you go. So, so overall, uh, the Microsoft stuff, how are you guys feeling? Anything you guys want to say further to kind of wrap up this Microsoft thing?

44:18.000 --> 44:32.000
I think, I mean, I'm just getting a little tired of all the zombie games. Honestly, it was stated the cage. It felt like, you know, especially in the beginning it was like, Oh, Hey, it's arena game. Oh, Hey, it's a zombie game up now. Another arena game.

44:32.000 --> 44:43.000
It's like, dude, let's show some different types of games. That was a little bit tiresome. I think there's a lot of titles that they showed that I'm just not interested in, but there were a few that were interesting.

44:43.000 --> 44:56.000
Sadly enough though, and as I've been saying for the last few years, they haven't shown me anything that wants, that's convinced me to buy their console. And yeah, I guess I have a copy of windows 10, so there's a win for them.

44:56.000 --> 45:07.000
But dude, it's kind of like my only option, you know, if I want to experience most of the stuff that's out there. So I wouldn't exactly call that a win means cause it's kind of a requirement.

45:07.000 --> 45:22.000
But on top of that, it's just, I don't know. I mean, that's the thing is like, what's selling me on this. If I have a PC that can run it, nothing. So who's the, if you're like trying to sell an enthusiast on this, who is really the target audience for this?

45:22.000 --> 45:37.000
I don't know for, yeah, uh, for me, the big winner today was PC gaming was the big winner today. Uh, and I was, I guess I am more ready for 4k gaming than I thought I was. Um, and I look forward to playing a lot of those games that were shown on my PC.

45:37.000 --> 45:40.000
I guess, you know, that's the weird, that's the weird place.

45:40.000 --> 45:57.000
If you don't have a high end PC and you really don't want to drop, like it's probably gonna be over a thousand dollars for one, then it's not a bad option if you already have a 4k TV to drop $499 for it. So I could see that as a plus if you don't have a PC that can run that stuff. But if you do, there's probably not really anything for you there.

45:57.000 --> 46:14.000
And YYR in chat kind of reemphasizing that saying, please remind yourselves of this fact, most gamers do not have gaming PCs. So that's, that's who the Xbox one X is ultimately for at the end of the day. But for us, I guess here as gamers, we're not feeling that because we, most of us do run computer rigs.

46:14.000 --> 46:36.000
Well, and then on top of that though, if you do not have a 4k TV and you're not really looking to spend the money on one, I mean, they did just drop the price of the Xbox one at least this week is going to be $50 cheaper. So that might be something to consider or wait until holiday, uh, when those games come out and wait for the deals. I bet you anything they're going to have a bundle with a crackdown at some point. So just wait.

46:36.000 --> 46:51.000
All right. Well, let's get into the video games that we have been playing this week with how was your gaming week? Uh, believe it or not, we still have a lot of other news to get into and we will get to those. We're going to try to fit in your calls tonight as well at orange lounge radio on Skype a little later in the show.

46:51.000 --> 46:58.000
But again, we do have to end at nine o'clock due to other E3 events going on, but we do, of course we have to talk about our gaming weeks. There's still stuff we're playing dark soccer.

46:58.000 --> 47:13.000
Um, Shane owned me the nonary games, so I didn't get a chance to start them yet, but it's ready to go. I've been busy weekend. Um, I started, I actually played a little world before craft, uh, play the usual stuff on the phone.

47:13.000 --> 47:36.000
I also, out of just morbid curiosity, downloaded dragon ball online and, um, it, it makes me think a lot of, um, the second iteration of, um, Ragnarok online, kind of that same feel. Um, the game, the English version anyway is very unfinished.

47:36.000 --> 48:05.000
Um, I mean the game is there, but like several whole quests are still in Korean. So it wasn't even developed by a Japanese company. It's, it's all in Korean. Um, and then some that's in English and like it's poorly translated English at that. So I don't know. It's, it's kind of neat. It's novel, but I'm probably not going to play any more of it. Um, but that's really the only thing new and notable on my list.

48:06.000 --> 48:09.000
All right. Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?

48:09.000 --> 48:24.000
I didn't play a whole ton. I played a little bit of grand theft out of five. Just kind of mess around with that. I did play this game though that I saw, I think it was out of a game jam that someone created and he had linked it on Twitter. It's a game called Baba is you. And what it was, it's a very simple.

48:24.000 --> 48:27.000
Oh, the Babadook is very in right now. I don't know if you know about this.

48:27.000 --> 48:28.000
The what?

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
The Babadook is

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
It's officially, um, an icon.

48:32.000 --> 48:35.000
The LGBT icon of 2017, the Babadook.

48:35.000 --> 48:36.000
Babaslay.

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
Yes. I am Babashook, honey.

48:38.000 --> 48:39.000
Yes.

48:39.000 --> 48:42.000
Okay. Well, I don't understand what the hell you're talking about right now.

48:43.000 --> 48:44.000
That's fair. Okay.

48:44.000 --> 48:45.000
Work Baba.

48:45.000 --> 49:00.000
Okay. For those, for those that don't understand, there is a horror film called Babadook and Netflix in its glory of categorizing things on Netflix accidentally put this movie in LGBT films this week.

49:00.000 --> 49:11.000
So now this is this huge meme is that the Babadook, which is, you know, a killer monster thing that kind of looks like, I don't know, is this huge LGBT icon.

49:11.000 --> 49:17.000
And already there's been, there were some parades, I think in Washington, DC, there's Babadooks in the parade.

49:17.000 --> 49:20.000
Somebody went to the drag race finale that was taped.

49:20.000 --> 49:25.000
One of the, like one of the, not one of the drag queens on the show, but somebody went dressed as the Babadook.

49:25.000 --> 49:32.000
So this is the hot new LGBT sensation for 2017 is the Babadook.

49:32.000 --> 49:36.000
So it's getting to say the word Babadook.

49:36.000 --> 49:37.000
Okay.

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
This has nothing to do with that.

49:39.000 --> 49:40.000
Sadly.

49:40.000 --> 49:43.000
So Baba is You is basically, it's a puzzle game.

49:43.000 --> 49:48.000
So the point of the game is to get to the win condition in there.

49:48.000 --> 49:52.000
So a lot of it is, and what's fun is it's kind of like programming.

49:52.000 --> 49:57.000
So in, within the game screen itself, they'll have, you know, little phrases.

49:57.000 --> 50:05.000
So Baba is You, and then they'll have like flag is win, brick is stop, that type of stuff.

50:05.000 --> 50:17.000
And so you have to get through these mazes by not only manipulating, you know, where you're going, but by also manipulating these conditions in there by pushing stuff around.

50:17.000 --> 50:24.000
So like, for example, you could push, you know, brick into is you, and then you become all the bricks on the map.

50:24.000 --> 50:30.000
Or, you know, you could put like that touching the fire, which would normally kill you, is win.

50:30.000 --> 50:34.000
And so all of a sudden touching the fire is the win condition in the game.

50:34.000 --> 50:38.000
And so it's kind of clever in that sense that you have to keep moving stuff around.

50:38.000 --> 50:44.000
And so I enjoyed it. It was like 12 levels that the guy made for this game jam and finished in about like 30 minutes.

50:44.000 --> 50:45.000
But it's fun.

50:45.000 --> 50:46.000
That's a fun concept.

50:46.000 --> 50:53.000
That's a pretty cool concept. So go check it out. Baba is You. I think it's on itch.io. So go search for it and it's free.

50:53.000 --> 50:58.000
So why not? And then what else they play?

50:58.000 --> 51:05.000
Honestly, that's it. I've been thinking about things like to do for like streaming because since everybody's getting on that stream, streaming train.

51:05.000 --> 51:11.000
So one of the concepts I came up with was, you know, I like the Elder Scrolls Skyrim.

51:11.000 --> 51:16.000
So I wanted to do, you know, just kind of like, you know, mod rim.

51:16.000 --> 51:23.000
So basically it would be a Skyrim game with some really terrible mods, like I'd randomly pick like 100 terrible mods.

51:23.000 --> 51:32.000
And then from that, I'd start off with like, you know, say 25 of them enabled and it would be at random and then keep adding to it each time until the game just breaks.

51:32.000 --> 51:39.000
OK, I like that. There are modern shows on Twitch, but I like your concept. I do just say it would be stranger and stranger each time.

51:39.000 --> 51:40.000
That's the whole point.

51:40.000 --> 51:45.000
That's good. I feel like now I need a concept because everybody else, you know, Bobby wants to do this whole more VR streaming thing.

51:45.000 --> 51:49.000
You want to do your mod thing. And I feel like I need an angle.

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
I just think, I don't know. I couldn't think of anything interesting.

51:51.000 --> 51:52.000
That's good.

51:52.000 --> 51:56.000
Other than if I could go back and play Grand Theft Auto 4 because I kicked ass at Grand Theft Auto 4.

51:56.000 --> 51:59.000
Nobody's playing Grand Theft Auto 4, so who knows?

51:59.000 --> 52:07.000
Come on. Come on a night like this in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says call it Loki's bad rim stream.

52:08.000 --> 52:09.000
Bad rim stream?

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
There's a joke there. But anyway, all right.

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
Or I should see below that Loki's rim job.

52:14.000 --> 52:15.000
Yes.

52:16.000 --> 52:17.000
That's the joke.

52:17.000 --> 52:18.000
Yep.

52:18.000 --> 52:22.000
I like that Loki's rim job. I think you'd get a lot of, a lot of viewers.

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
But it doesn't really shout out mods.

52:25.000 --> 52:26.000
OK, mod rim job.

52:26.000 --> 52:27.000
I don't know.

52:27.000 --> 52:28.000
Mod rim.

52:28.000 --> 52:29.000
All right. Anyway.

52:29.000 --> 52:30.000
OK, so my gaming week.

52:31.000 --> 52:35.000
I actually, speaking of streaming, I had a great Overwatch stream last night at a lot of fun.

52:35.000 --> 52:40.000
I was thinking on a Saturday night nobody would be watching, but I had a great stream last night on Overwatch, so that was a lot of fun.

52:40.000 --> 52:48.000
Speaking of streaming, I will be focusing on, and I know not everybody's a fan of this, but this is a game I've been looking forward to for a very long time.

52:48.000 --> 52:56.000
Stormblood, Final Fantasy XIV's newest expansion, launches on Friday, so I will be dedicating some serious hours to streaming Stormblood.

52:56.000 --> 53:03.000
So those of you that kind of want to, you know, look at the game with me as I go through the story, I'll be doing a few hours on Friday and Saturday.

53:03.000 --> 53:13.000
Obviously, with the OLR 15th next Sunday, it's going to be kind of busy, but I'm going to try to fit in, and then I go to Chicago on the Thursday next.

53:13.000 --> 53:18.000
So, you know, I'm going to fit in as much as I can in that time, but I will be spending some serious hours on Stormblood.

53:18.000 --> 53:22.000
But anyway, outside of that and streaming and everything, I did check out some new games this week.

53:22.000 --> 53:25.000
Well, I guess this does tie back to streaming.

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
Sorry, but this is somebody else's stream.

53:28.000 --> 53:36.000
Our pallet vog network, Flaco Jones, has been streaming a lot of Friday the 13th, and I watch enough of it because, you know, Flaco's a friend of mine.

53:36.000 --> 53:42.000
I wanted to support him, and I was very happy he got affiliateship and all that, and he, you know, he does some funny stuff, an extrovert will join him sometimes.

53:42.000 --> 53:53.000
He kind of got into playing a lot of the Friday the 13th game on PlayStation 4, and I was like, well, I think I might be sold on this, but I want to get it on PC because it seems like that's where everybody was at.

53:53.000 --> 53:58.000
But it was seriously getting to the point where, like, he would be playing the game, and he'd be like, I wonder who's Jason, I wonder who's Jason.

53:58.000 --> 54:02.000
I'd be like, push up, push up to see who Jason is, and that will show you.

54:02.000 --> 54:08.000
He's like, I feel like, oh God, I'm backseat driving on a stream right now, which, you know, better me than a stranger, but still.

54:08.000 --> 54:11.000
It got to the point where I was like, you know what, I just need to fucking buy this game.

54:11.000 --> 54:21.000
And Flaco's birthday was over the weekend, and he was doing a birthday stream, and I was like, you know what, for Flaco's birthday, I'm going to buy a video game for myself.

54:21.000 --> 54:22.000
How nice of you.

54:22.000 --> 54:23.000
How nice of me.

54:23.000 --> 54:30.000
So I bought Friday the 13th on PlayStation 4, but so I could play with Flaco and all of that, and why not?

54:30.000 --> 54:34.000
It seems like pretty much, you know, the people I would play this with are on PlayStation 4.

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
So I finally bought the game on PlayStation 4.

54:36.000 --> 54:44.000
I got in one round with him that night, and we, except I got killed first, because, and again, this was me being the backseat driver.

54:44.000 --> 54:53.000
We all went for the car, and I'm like, never go for the car, because Jason is always at the car, because he knows everybody goes for the car.

54:53.000 --> 55:00.000
And, but it was like, Xtavor had the keys, I had the gas, and Flaco had whatever else you need, the fuse or whatever else you need to get the car going.

55:00.000 --> 55:10.000
So like, all three of us are running to the car, and since Xtavor and Flaco had played before, they got it ready to go, and I'm sitting there spilling gas all over the floor, because I can't do it, because I hadn't played the game before.

55:10.000 --> 55:15.000
And then Jason shows up and murders me, and I'm like, and sure enough, we can't get the fucking car to start.

55:15.000 --> 55:19.000
So, I mean, it was, I'm sure it was hilarious to watch, but that was frustrating.

55:19.000 --> 55:24.000
But anyway, we will learn, and we will do better in the future with future games and so forth.

55:24.000 --> 55:33.000
So there was that, but another game on PlayStation 4, I haven't really had a chance to do any streaming or talk about yet, but I did buy this game, and I've been playing it a little bit over the weekend.

55:33.000 --> 55:37.000
Wipeout Omega Collection came out, and I was like, I like the Wipeout games.

55:37.000 --> 55:46.000
I still don't have an F-Zero for this generation, so Wipeout is kind of my, well, Fast Racing Neo does this too, but Wipeout is my other little F-Zero substitute.

55:46.000 --> 56:00.000
So if you didn't know, Wipeout Omega Collection is out on PlayStation 4, and it is a combination of the most recent two Wipeout games, although Wipeout on PlayStation 3 had like a full service expansion, so it's kind of three games.

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
I thought it was also like the Vita one as well.

56:02.000 --> 56:14.000
It is. It's the Vita game, and then it's the two on PlayStation 3. And so it's that, but on PlayStation 4, and it's all kind of in one package, and just packaged as like one big game, sort of, even though there's like three different campaigns within it.

56:14.000 --> 56:23.000
But I don't know what else to say. It's Wipeout, and it's pretty, and it's fast, and apparently it does like 4K and stuff on the Pro.

56:23.000 --> 56:38.000
Since I have a PlayStation Pro, but I have an older TV, all I can say is that it's smooth. It's like butter. It's a very smooth, fast game, and it's fun. It's still Wipeout, so I'm enjoying playing that.

56:38.000 --> 56:45.000
So I want to make more progress through some of the campaigns. I haven't even touched online or any of that stuff, but I was just happy to play some Wipeout.

56:45.000 --> 56:48.000
So that was the other game I played this week, Wipeout Omega Collection.

56:48.000 --> 56:58.000
Cool. All right. Housekeeping. So guess what? If you hadn't heard, even though we've been saying it a lot the past few weeks, but I know some folks are here tonight because of Z3 who haven't been listening in a while.

56:58.000 --> 57:08.000
Next week, seven days from tonight, Orange Lounge Radio turns 15 years old. That's right, 15 years old. So our 15th anniversary show is next week.

57:09.000 --> 57:18.000
And just stay tuned to social media throughout the week because we may be doing some special things throughout the week to kind of mark that 15 years old.

57:18.000 --> 57:30.000
I would go so far as to say, again, the internet is a big place, but in 15 years, I have yet to find another. We will be the first gaming podcast to hit 15 years, consecutive years.

57:30.000 --> 57:38.000
I'm not sure if any other show, any other podcast has hit 15 years. I'm not aware.

57:38.000 --> 57:39.000
Well, podcasting has, but...

57:39.000 --> 57:49.000
Yeah, and to be fair, to be fair, it started as a live internet show and then shifted into a podcast. So I realized there's some nuances there where I can't really say it's a 15 year old podcast because it's not.

57:49.000 --> 57:56.000
But, you know, I still, I mean, are there a lot of internet shows out there that have been going for 15 years consecutively? No breaks.

57:56.000 --> 58:06.000
So, you know, obviously a week here and a week there for holidays, but you guys know what I mean? Like, you know, we've been going for 15 years. So, yeah, so we're going to celebrate next week.

58:06.000 --> 58:15.000
I'm not going to promise a big party or a celebration, but I will have Skype open a little longer next week. We're probably actually not going to be able to have it open too much tonight because of the Bethesda thing.

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
But next week, E3 wrap ups.

58:17.000 --> 58:27.000
Well, yeah, but it'll be different cause we can kind of like solely focus on that and then we can move into, if you guys want to call, talk about OLR, talk about, you know, what the show has done for you or what you want to see from us in the next 15 years.

58:27.000 --> 58:41.000
He, he, we can talk about that and that'll be fun. And Bobby and I have been talking behind the scenes about some things we want to do for VOG to that I think will be really good for the show's future and kind of like, you know, what'll, what'll happen in the next few years.

58:41.000 --> 58:50.000
As more and more people are doing this video streaming thing, that's for sure. You know, where do we fit into that? So that'll be really exciting. So, yes, that is in seven days.

58:50.000 --> 58:58.000
Also a long time OLR fan and, and she, she kind of comes out for the bigger shows. Misty is going to be here. Misty OLR will be here in studio.

58:58.000 --> 59:06.000
I'm not sure of anybody else who says they will be here in person yet, but if you're interested in coming, if you're in the area, drop me a line and we can probably make that happen.

59:06.000 --> 59:16.000
I should probably invite Gabe. I bet he would want to come for that episode cause he's put, he's, he's pushing again. I don't know if I'm supposed to talk about it, but I'm going to talk about it cause I didn't sign anything.

59:16.000 --> 59:26.000
I'm getting a little, little preview of the release build of his game this week. So I know he's pushing that cause that's finally happening. So maybe he'll want to come talk about that now that that's about out.

59:26.000 --> 59:39.000
So, all right. Anyhow, let's move on into some gaming news. Uh, you can always follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR, facebook.com slash orange launch radio, but for now more news. Loki.

59:39.000 --> 59:53.000
Yes. Uh, so they had this whole Pokemon Nintendo direct and they talked about, you know, some new stuff that's coming out and everyone's like, Oh shit, here comes the Pokemon game on the switch.

59:54.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Well, yeah, it's a Pokemon game. I guess. Pokken tournament is heading to the switch. Pokken tournament deluxe. Woo. Five new fighters.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:14.000
You know what? Okay. Here's the thing. You're not excited about that, but like act-deaf does a huge fan of Pokken. I know. And he's really excited about that. So this is kind of one of those things where it's like you're into it or you're not. You know what I mean?

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:22.000
No, Pokken tournament's fine. I'm just like, you know, we're adding five fighters for $60 basically.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:40.000
But if you miss the Wii U as a lot of people did, and this is going to be your first Pokken game, then great. But I will say this for me, I did buy Pokken on the Wii U and I'm where you're at. I'm like, this isn't going to be enough for me to justify on the switch because I'm not that into Pokken, but cool for the people who are.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Yeah. So they've added five new players, as I mentioned. So they've got Dark Cry, Scizor, Empulim, Croagunk, and Decidueye. I probably butchered those.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:03.000
They're also adding three versus three team battles ranked in group matches, and it's coming out on the switch on September 22nd.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Along with that, they're also launching some new 3DS Pokemon games. Pokemon Sun and Moon, they're getting the Ultra version. So Pokemon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:27.000
This sounds a little Black 2, White 2 to me. They haven't confirmed that that's the case, but that's the vibe I'm getting from these is that this is like Black 2, White 2.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Yeah. So they're saying that it's like an alternate storyline from the original and it's got some additional Pokemon as well. And those will be coming out on the 3DS.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:38.000
November 17th, they're not coming out on the switch, which is kind of weird.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.000
I'm thinking, though, that maybe they're going to announce something at E3.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:50.000
No, no. I'm going to tell you right now, don't get your hopes up for that. Pokemon Company kind of does their own thing. Don't. If you're going into E3, go and they're going to wait and announce E3. Don't.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:58.000
I mean, be pleasantly surprised if they do, but I'm telling you, not going to happen. Nintendo's only going for 30 minutes on Tuesday and this ain't there.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:05.000
And you know what? That's okay. I mean, yeah, I think a lot of us had our hopes high because of this Pokemon Stars leak and all this stuff.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:11.000
But the reality is, Pokemon tends to lag behind on the systems a little bit, at least for the mainline games.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:19.000
This was true when the 3DS was well out on the market, doing fine, and yet they still released Black 2, White 2 on the DS.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:25.000
But then again, the 3DS could play DS games, so it's also a little different. But I digress.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:31.000
I don't think it's that big a deal that the Pokemon games did not skip to the switch. I think we all want to see it go there.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:39.000
But they're going to have to go there eventually. Right now, Nintendo is pushing that new 2DS, or whatever they call it.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:44.000
I can't remember the name of it anymore. But that thing, they are still pushing, so they need a game to kind of go with that.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:49.000
So here you go. Among some other things, I mean, to be fair, there's other things in the DS universe that are happening as well.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.000
So there you go. There's Pokemon still keeping that going.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:58.000
And spoiler, you might want to just wait until holiday when they have a bundle with the new 2DS and that.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Oh, that's not a spoiler. That's inevitable. Come on. Alright. But okay, fine. I mean, that's fine.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.000
I don't think there was any necessarily bad news in there.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:13.000
No, it's just kind of disappointing. I mean, I'm not surprised.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Yeah. Alright, moving on. Let's talk about another game announcement from this week was the Mega Man Legacy Collection 2.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:30.000
That's right. Mega Man Legacy Collection 2 is on its way out and it is going to be out on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:36.000
It's being released in August. It will be $20 and it contains Mega Man 7, 8, 9, and 10.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Mega Man 9 and 10, of course, a little bit newer. Those games were on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:47.000
because that was kind of when Mega Man came back in its old 8-bit style. Remember those games, 9 and 10?

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:53.000
So that's a part of this. But of course, 7 and 8 were very different because they were not on the original NES.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:04:00.000
They were on later systems. Well, 7 was on Super Nintendo and 8 was on PlayStation.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:05.000
So these are all being packaged together into one thing. So that's kind of cool.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:11.000
But it is starting to get very glaring that Capcom is omitting the Switch yet again.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:21.000
And they did this with the Disney Afternoon Collection and now they're doing it again with the universe that people are most familiar with, with Mega Man.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Could it be because they're going to include all these games in their Netflix-style service and so it would be kind of stupid to sell it?

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:37.000
That's where my brain's going, is that maybe they are skipping the Switch because there's more money to be made on Virtual Console or perhaps the Netflix thing, whatever.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:43.000
I mean, we still don't know what the hell the difference is, if there is one. I'm hoping we get some answers to that on Tuesday.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:51.000
But again, I'm setting my bar at a very low level so that I don't get pissed off. And I suggest y'all do the same.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:05:04.000
You know you're going to hear about Mario Odyssey. You know you're going to hear about Splatoon 2. Keep your bar low around there and you have a lot less room to get pissed off at something not being there.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Don't fucking expect Metroid. Don't expect F-Zero. Don't fucking do it because you're going to be mad. So why do that?

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Just say, you know what, it's going to be 30 minutes of Super Mario Odyssey and then you're going to be happy with anything outside of that. Anything.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:31.000
So, just a suggestion. But anyway, yeah, they are skipping Nintendo Switch and Nintendo 3DS. They're just saying, all Capcom's saying is, we're focusing on developing the game for Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:37.000
There's no further information available on this subject at this time. So in other words, enough people are not complaining about it.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:51.000
But, I mean, not that usually I'm one for Twitter campaigns, but I simply took the official Capcom announcement, did the quote tweet, and said, I'll buy it when it's on the Switch. And that's how I feel. I'll buy it when it's on the Switch.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Here's another thought to that. Could it be the cartridge prices? Because if you think about it, there's been a lot of games that'll come out for $19.99 on one platform and they're $39.99 on the Switch.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Eh, this isn't a cartridge release anyway. This is a digital release on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
Is it only digital?

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Umm, it's got to be. For 20 bucks, it's got to be. I would feel confident in saying yes, it's only digital.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Hmm.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.000
So.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Alright. Well, I thought that might be enough.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:22.000
No, it's fine.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Because there's been a lot of games that have come out.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:29.000
You win some, you lose some. I think your virtual console thing is something that this one is not.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:44.000
It's confusing. So it's either got to be, it's got to be one of two things. Either this is this Netflix-type service, or it's because it's getting a physical release and the cartridges are fucking expensive, which is sad, but.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Let me say this quickly. I don't want to dive too far down this Nintendo rabbit hole, because let's be real, by the time a lot of you are hearing this, we could have some answers on this. Or we may not, I don't know.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:07:06.000
But here's my thing. I get the sense that Nintendo's online classics thing is focusing on two-player games and head-to-head games. Why?

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Because that's the big new draw here for these games is that you're going to be able to play Dr. Mario live against somebody via the Nintendo network.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:18.000
And that's going to be the big draw as two-player. Mega Man's not a two-player game.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:32.000
I think that if there is a virtual console, virtual console is going to focus on things like GameCube and Wii games and things that are so new that they're not really appropriate for this other service.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:41.000
My gut tells me that's where the line is going to be drawn. We are going to have a virtual console, but it's going to be for really newer stuff. Ten years old type stuff.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:50.000
To that though, and this is a general question because I don't know the answer to this. I don't think Wii games are going to work on it.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Because the thing about it, it doesn't have motion control really. I mean, one controller sort of does, but it doesn't have the sensor bar and stuff like that that the Wii U has.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:06.000
It has support for that. But the Switch doesn't have that.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Those controllers have to be able to accomplish something similar.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:15.000
It's very limited I think, so I don't know. I don't know if it can.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:23.000
So by the way, YYR is correcting me in chat and sent me a link to a PlayStation 4 boxed version of Mega Man Legacy Collection 2.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:29.000
So there is a physical version of it, but it's digital only on Xbox One. Isn't that interesting?

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
So it's physical, but only on PlayStation 4.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Weird.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:39.000
But I'm sure it's both. Come on. Sony's not going to be like, oh you have to buy a physical. No way. No way. They get more money when you buy a digital.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:43.000
So it'll be okay. I stand corrected. Good job YYR.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Alright, moving on to other game stuff from this week. Dark Sakura.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Well, we had a little bit of a peek into the new Kingdom Hearts.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:09:00.000
I think it's going to be interesting though that they're going to be doing more of the release information of it at D23.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:07.000
Which for those who don't know, that's like the big Disney con that is going to be going on in July.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.000
We'll have to have Victoria look into that for us.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:15.000
I know. I'm like, now I'm going to have to see if our pal Victoria can do any reporting for VOG there on the scene.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Because she's all over that D23 stuff. She's a big cosplayer for all that.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:28.000
But at any rate, we don't really have a whole lot on it except really huge bosses and a little bit of the gameplay.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:34.000
But I think it's going, well that and of course Sora does finally look a little bit older.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:40.000
But I think it's going to be interesting to find out what that more is, you know?

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:45.000
I like the trailer. What little bit they were showing. That was cool.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:49.000
I mean, in one way it's unfortunate that it's not at E3 this year.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Which means winter 2018 at the earliest at this point.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.000
I'm sorry, I mean like November, December 2018 at the earliest at this point.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Yeah, I think it's at 2018.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
I ain't going to hold my breath on that.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:02.000
But anyway, here's where I start to get nervous.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Not just for this game, but Final Fantasy 7 Remake and all this stuff.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:10.000
So Microsoft is now starting to push this 4K gaming thing.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:16.000
There's a very distinct possibility depending on what happens this holiday with that thing.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:19.000
There's a distinct possibility PlayStation 5.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Don't roll your eyes too heavy because depending on what happens with this 4K thing, PlayStation 5 could be announced next year.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:32.000
I would say 2019 at the latest at this point.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:38.000
So if these games get delayed much longer, they're going to miss the fucking boat.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:45.000
Or they're going to have to go back and be developed more for what now the current console is at this time.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:49.000
And then we get stuck in a fucking loop like we've had with Final Fantasy 15.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:54.000
The development was so fucking slow on that game, they ended up having to make it for the next generation.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
Because they couldn't finish it for the PlayStation 3.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:00.000
I did notice one thing in here that I super like, just re-reviewing this.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Yeah.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:02.000
The combo attacks.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Mhm.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.000
The combo attacks look really neat.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.000
It did look like Goofy and Donald might be useful.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Well, other than using up all my damn potions or whatever.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Yes.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.000
Yeah.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
But no, it looks really nice.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
Yeah. No, the trailer's great if you haven't seen it yet.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:22.000
But that was kind of their apology for, this is what you get, this is our E3, this is all we're saying now.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Oops.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:30.000
But, maybe it goes without saying that they didn't do that for Final Fantasy 7 Remake.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
Dot, dot, dot.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:35.000
But again, I'm gonna temper my expectations on that.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
I don't expect to see that at Sony's thing tomorrow.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Yeah.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.000
I don't.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Who knows though?

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Yeah. Who knows?

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Alright.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
Moving on, Loki.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:48.000
In the category of things that nobody asks for.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:57.000
And like, I remember that they had put out some remake of this shit and, or like remaster or something.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.000
On Steam, I believe it was.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Yeah, a steaming pile of something.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:10.000
So, Bubsy, The Woolies Strike Back, the trailer out of nowhere, the sequel that nobody asks for is making its way out.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Hold up.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Why is everybody hating on Bubsy?

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
I remember that game on Play, I own that game.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
It's Bubsy 3D, it's Bubsy 3D's fault really.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Fuck Bubsy 3D for a minute.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:22.000
You know what? Sometimes there's stinker games in series, okay?

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Here's the thing, I own the original Bubsy on PlayStation 1.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:29.000
I don't remember it being as particularly garbage as you all are saying it is.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:32.000
In fact, for its time, it was a fine platformer.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
It was one of like the platformers on PlayStation.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Yes, they fucked it hard with Bubsy 3D, but that's not what they're doing here.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:49.000
So, all I'm saying is that, like, where's this fake outrage at Bubsy coming from?

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Because I remember there was a time when Bubsy was actually pretty good.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:55.000
And if we're going back to that, then alright, cool, give it a chance.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:03.000
I mean, yeah, Bubsy's been gone for a long, long time and, you know, but, I don't know.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:06.000
It seems like it's not the end of, you know, it's not the most horrible time.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
It's alright. I mean, I don't know.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Not a game I'm interested in, but hey.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Yeah, so it's coming out on PlayStation 4 and PC this fall,

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:20.000
and it's actually kind of weird that it's coming out by developer Alkalaid,

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:24.000
which, shit, that was a developer that was around a long time ago.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.000
They were around in the 80s.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:28.000
Well, they were apparently the original developer of Bubsy.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
They made the fucking Test Drive series back in the day.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:31.000
Yes, they did.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
That was their big thing, was Test Drive.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:38.000
They made a game that I loved that next time Dark Sakura's absent

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
and I have to do the Classic Game of the Week, I'm picking this one.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:43.000
Alkalaid Comics was a game that I fucking loved on 64.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
Alright, as long as it's not Halo.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
We know better at this point, Jamie.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:50.000
But Alkalaid Comics was actually, I think you would actually really approve of this.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
It was a really cool title on the Commodore 64.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:57.000
So, yeah, those are Alkalaid games I can get into.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:01.000
But yeah, Bubsy is interesting that that's coming back.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:04.000
Now some folks in chat, okay, Eric RPG in chat says,

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Rob is lying to himself or forgot how bad it was.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.000
I'm not lying to myself.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
It is possible I forgot how bad it was.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:14.000
But I don't remember it being, I mean, yes, Bubsy 3D was fucking terrible.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:15.000
But I'm not talking about that one.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
I'm talking about the original ones.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Anyway, it's not worth arguing.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
You know what, I'm going to pick and choose my battles

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
and the Bubsy battle is not one I feel like fighting.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
I just don't.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:31.000
So I'm going to move on and talk about another game that maybe we're going to see.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:35.000
Oh, sorry, real quick, I wanted to mention one other thing regarding Bubsy.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:38.000
That's not the only game that's going to be coming back from Alkalaid.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.000
They're actually playing and releasing several games.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Test Drive?

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:43.000
Sadly not.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:48.000
Hardball, Slave Zero, Deadlock, Eradicator, and Redline.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:51.000
I know Hardball and that's like the only one on that list I know.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
No, Redline, I remember that too.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:56.000
I don't think Test Drive is something they can bring back because Atari has that.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
Yeah, they do, they do.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
And they really shit on that franchise.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Anyway, moving on to CD Projekt Red.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
They've been working on a game.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:10.000
They did The Witcher 3, obviously, which people went crazy over.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:13.000
It was a very well artistically done game.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:17.000
They've been working on a new game since then called Cyberpunk 2077.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:23.000
Well, interesting, they tweeted out an announcement this week that kind of surprised some people.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:31.000
And they said is that they had some documents stolen which contain designs for the upcoming game Cyberpunk 2077.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:36.000
And these individuals have sent them ransom notices saying a demand for ransom has been made.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:39.000
Saying that if they don't comply the files are going to be released to the general public.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:44.000
CD Projekt Red has come out and said we don't give in to demands so we're not doing it.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
And we've contacted the appropriate legal authorities.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:51.000
And they're basically saying the documents are old and unrepresentative of the current vision for the game.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:56.000
So only look for information to come from us that talks about the current vision of the game.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:00.000
And there's a couple ways you can kind of take this.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:05.000
There has been some serious problems out there recently with hacking and ransom demands.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:10.000
And probably the most famous or well known case right now is Netflix was hacked.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:16.000
And ten episodes from the most recent season of Orange is the New Black, which started on Friday,

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:21.000
were leaked like three months ago on the internet because Netflix did not comply with the ransom demands.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:26.000
There are thirteen episodes in the season but I guess ten were done at the time they stole them or whatever.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:30.000
So they all got leaked. So a lot of people saw those ten episodes a long time ago.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
They're only standard definition too I think.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:35.000
If they hang out and CD your places on the web.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:43.000
But there's other people that are looking at this going oh ha ha it's a cyberpunk thriller game hacker game.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:48.000
This is all a big, what do you fucking call those meta games?

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:51.000
No it's not ARG.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:56.000
No ARG that's it. This is all big ARG and this is all to build hype for the game.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:00.000
Here's the thing. In most cases I would think that would be pretty clever.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:04.000
However CD Projekt specifically says in this announcement.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:09.000
The documents are old and largely unrepresentative of the current vision of the game.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:13.000
If this was all a gag to get you to look at what is released.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:17.000
They would not be distancing themselves from the material like that.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:24.000
To me that's what proves that this is something where unfortunately CD Projekt Red has found themselves in a Netflix like scenario.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:29.000
But in my opinion good on them for not paying the people holding this ransom.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:35.000
That's pretty fucking terrible in the day and age that we live in and just shows how important cyber security is.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
Because people don't rob banks anymore.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:41.000
They break into computers and then demand for ransom. That's what it is right?

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
So it sucks.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:48.000
Dungeon Buster says ransomware is just getting worse. Unfortunately everyone wants bitcoins.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
Boom. There you go.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:53.000
Alright let's move on. Hopefully something a little more positive. DarkSakura?

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:57.000
Well one thing I am super excited about.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:05.000
I'm sure that some of our people listening watched the Apple keynote from the developers conference.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Yeah it almost seems like a lifetime ago at this point. But yeah that was just this past week.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Yeah and honestly enough I was seriously more interested in a lot of that than what was going on in E3.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:23.000
Because the big thing that stuck out to me and I actually had never considered that it would happen.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:28.000
Is that they're working on VR for Mac OS.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:38.000
They've already got developer kits going out for VR along with the kits going for $599.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:43.000
And on the new operating system there's going to be support for external GPUs.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:46.000
So this is going to be really good for developers.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:51.000
And then on top of that we had the AR demo during the keynote.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:56.000
Which was pretty fun. I mean watching people fall off the end of a table was kind of silly.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:00.000
But then you know there's Metal 2 coming out.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:07.000
All these systems are coming with much better graphics processors. Much better graphic cards.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:14.000
And it just makes me think that I think gaming. People say I don't know who plays games on the Mac.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:19.000
But I think it's really going to end up being a major contender down the line.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:23.000
Well everybody. Well I shouldn't say everybody because some people own Android.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:28.000
But a lot of people play games on Apple because of iPhone and iOS and that whole thing.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:29.000
Games look really good.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:35.000
I think everybody's kind of been sitting here going we're just waiting for Apple to kind of break the seal.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Like you know they started to kind of go there with Apple TV but they didn't really go all in for me.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:45.000
But now you're right. When we're seeing some of this VR stuff it's starting to go okay.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:48.000
So Apple is starting to dip their toe in here.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:54.000
I think the dipping already happened because I mean like I said I'm playing.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:58.000
I say dip the toe because where is the VR software for me to play and buy today.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:19:59.000
It's in development now.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
Right. So we're not there yet.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:05.000
I'm referring more to gaming in general because I mean I'll put it this way.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:15.000
I didn't mention it in my my gaming week but I've also got a Borderlands the pre sequel I've been playing on this little guy right here.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:19.000
I've been playing and then I will play on an iMac.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:26.000
I think I like is that I've been you know using the steam to save my game saves.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:29.000
I pick up and play on any computer I want to.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:32.000
I can just play it on my PC I can play it on my Mac.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
Does Borderlands do the third person stuff.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
How are you playing that without getting motion sick.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
I play it in burst.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.000
It's fun though.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:40.000
Yeah.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:44.000
But I mean I was how I was with Katamari Damacy.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:56.000
You know but I'm just thinking that you know I think that that that stereotype is quite an outdated thought.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:05.000
I think that it's people just holding on to an outdated concept that is quickly becoming quite the opposite.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:10.000
Well here I my my biggest concerns is you know a system is always good as the games that are on it.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:14.000
So we'll see what is delivered on this device after the development phase.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:19.000
My other big concern is that Apple is not always known for doing things on the cheap.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:25.000
So I mean you're going to need a beefy computer to play this that costs a lot of money through Apple.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:33.000
So but if Apple can deliver the experience that's worth it if they can deliver the Rolls Royce of gaming experience then they can justify the Rolls Royce price.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:36.000
So I'm not saying but I'm just saying that that is a concern to me.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:50.000
And as also was mentioned in that same keynote that they have dropped the price for one of the new IMAX that are out right now as well as for the MacBook Pros.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Do those have any integrated cards in them because I mean this is their radiance.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:57.000
Well this solution is an external card.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:05.000
It's using the Thunderbolt port like you can add external cards using a Thunderbolt port but the enclosure itself is like six hundred dollars.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:10.000
Well a lot of this right now is for development but that should be live like next year for the consumer.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:17.000
And I would think by then you know the prices are only dropping on this technology by then it should be a little bit more affordable anyway.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:22.000
And on top of that too you know how much do people spend on gaming PCs.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:33.000
You know if a person wants it badly enough and I'll already put it this way you know I think that and this is just in my use.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:49.000
I mean I think that I would rather pay more money and get something that I know number one is is a good machine and number two I'm not going to have to worry about replacing parts in all the time.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:56.000
So you know I think this comment is said a little tongue in cheek but I actually think there's a lot more legit.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:59.000
I think there's a big point in this in our chat from Bobby Black Wolf.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:13.000
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says now that Apple has invented VR and AR I see it getting more much more adoption with the masses just like how Apple invented the tablet touch screen computer eight years after Bill Gates held up a similar device and nobody cared.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:20.000
So it's really only going to help you know you joke and you say that but are you wrong.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:28.000
I mean to be fair Apple does have a way of making this shit look really really cool and like something you want Apple.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:35.000
Yes they did and I they did a phone that was already done but they did it the Apple way and you had to have one.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:40.000
So maybe maybe in a way this is the breakthrough VR needs.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:53.000
I would think so because I mean now that I know I could just you know plug in on you know on my MacBook and take it with me and that it's going to have the processing power it needs for it.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:24:01.000
I don't see a problem and I will probably get so motion sick I throw up all over everybody at Starbucks but hey it'll be a heck of a barf.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:02.000
Yes it will.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
Bobby in chat clarifies I'm not joking.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:05.000
So all right there you go.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:09.000
All right let's move on though for time again I get make sure we get through a lot of this stuff here.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.000
So moving on Loki.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:16.000
So remember we talked a little bit about how the creator of Super Meat Boy was teasing a new project.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:19.000
Now we know a little bit more about what that project is.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:34.000
It's actually an action adventure platformer game called The End is Nigh and yes it still also has kind of a similar art style to the other games like Super Meat Boy and The Binding of Isaac.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
It's going to be available on Steam.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:42.000
It looks like July 12th so they actually have a trailer out for it and you can check it out now.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:46.000
But yeah it's very Super Meat Boyish.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:51.000
I mean the it really really reminds me of that.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
So check it out.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:54.000
Good day.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:59.000
Good to see what's finally come from them because I know we've been kind of waiting a little while to see what they were going to unveil.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:08.000
So they're saying 600 plus levels 12 explorable chapters 20 collectibles 80 achievements and hundreds of collectible little squishy tumors.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:14.000
I guess the game is this is the end is nice it's probably an adventure platformer game where the player takes control of Ash.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:23.000
One of the few things that have survived the end of the world follow Ash as he flops through the future a pain and suffering feel his stress levels rise.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:34.000
You throw him into endless swarms of decaying mutant animal like creatures and help aid his final epic quest to simply make a friend out of the people he pieces of people he finds along his journey.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:35.000
All right.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:38.000
Well one more thing before we get to the classic game of the week.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:44.000
Remember how I said earlier that there's there's easier ways to steal people's money than robbing a bank these days.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Well guess what.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:48.000
Another company has been breached by credit cards.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:51.000
It may appear in its GameStop.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:58.000
So GameStop actually sent letters to online customers informing them that credit card information may have been stolen.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:13.000
So obviously this letter is out there so many blogs are getting a hold of it saying that credit card information to for anyone who quote placed or attempted to place older orders on our Web site from August 10th 2016 to February 9th 2017.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
So you know last Christmas.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
You know when you're placing switch orders.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:18.000
Yes.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
So this is not good.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:23.000
So it looks like that may have been breached.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:33.000
So they have to notify because you get an email attempted to place an order during that time period and used a payment card ending in you know whatever it is confirming that your card is potentially in the list there.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:41.000
GameStop identified and addressed a potential security incident that was related to transactions made it made on GameStop's Web site during a specific period of time.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:48.000
GameStop mailed notification letters to customers who made purchases during that time frame advised him of the incident and providing information on steps they can take.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:51.000
That was a statement they said about those letters.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:54.000
And you know this is not good news for GameStop.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:57.000
It's our industry is starting to go a little more and more digital.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:05.000
And as retailers are getting you know less and less business because of online a lot more people are shopping online these days.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:08.000
And you just ask Sears Montgomery Ward Montgomery Ward.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:14.000
Well well them Macy's the one I was trying to think of the Sears Macy's and all these places they're closing.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:18.000
You know the last Kmart in Sacramento is going to close.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:19.000
That's right.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:20.000
All right.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:21.000
All right.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
Where are we going to get our 80s fashions.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:24.000
Auburn.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:25.000
You have to go to Kmart in Auburn.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
Be open.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:31.000
If you still need your raucous do caucus shirts.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
Well they'll be available up in Auburn.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:34.000
All right.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
So yeah.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:48.000
Not good news for GameStop especially hot off the heels of the whole you know circle of life thing that came around a few months ago where you know they were really pushing you know the trades and the preorders and all that.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:49.000
All right.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:54.000
Anyhow I'm going to chat over at live dot vog network dot com.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:57.000
Act Deaf is pointing out speaking of reservations.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
Forza Motorsport 7 is up on Amazon.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:00.000
Of course.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
Of course they want you to drop those preorders on games you just saw.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:03.000
Did you see.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:04.000
Did you see they so.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Hey guess what.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
Available now to preorder.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:10.000
No available now in the Xbox store.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
You can go preorder them digitally.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:17.000
Why would you ever want to preorder a digital game.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
Maybe there's a bonus.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
That's that's what it's all about these days.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:22.000
But yeah I know.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:26.000
I mean like oh my God there might not be enough copies.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
I might not get one.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
All right.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Let's let's travel to a simpler time.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:36.000
Let's go back to a time when it's like you know what.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:37.000
You don't get digital.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:42.000
There's no that maybe you have a 300 baud modem and that's it.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:46.000
Maybe you can't afford a modem because the technology is still right.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:47.000
That's right.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:50.000
You still have to turn a crank if you want to call it BBS.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:29:01.000
Your your modem was a pink box that had two rubber divots on it that you put your phone receiver on to.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
And it called shit.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:04.000
The Sega Channel.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
Yes.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:07.000
All right.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:08.000
It's the classic game of the week.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:18.000
But in a 2017 twist Dark Sakura once a month likes to spotlight an entire system that she thinks hey stop neglecting this system.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:19.000
That had no internet.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:27.000
And especially this week when we're all focused on you know the switches and the Xbox One X and the PlayStation fours.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:28.000
We need.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:31.000
Let's not forget this system of classic.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
This one is rather precious to my childhood.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:34.000
All right.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:35.000
So what is the classic system of the week.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:41.000
The magnet the Magnavox Odyssey 2 or I would say Odyssey squared the way it's written but Odyssey 2.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:45.000
In Europe it was called the Philips video pack G7000.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:48.000
In Brazil it was the Philips Odyssey.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:51.000
But you know I grew up with it as Odyssey 2.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:59.000
There had been a first Odyssey system in 1970s.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:05.000
These noises don't don't trigger at all with this game.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:15.000
Anyway the system was released in 1978.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:20.000
So it was like it was old school.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:21.000
It was old school.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:27.000
Now in the U.S. we got it in 1979 but it was first released in Europe.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:31.000
And I played one of these when I was a teensy kid.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
I'll put it that way.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:41.000
But anyway one of the neat things about it is that it did play on the original Odyssey.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Probably the original Odyssey design that had removable circuit cards that would let you switch between built in games.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:58.000
Now this one the Odyssey 2 it all had its own individual video game cartridges.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:07.000
And the neat thing about it with this is that it also allowed for background graphics, foreground graphics.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:11.000
It had all kinds of different things going on that were kind of new at the time for how they were.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:16.000
It also used the joystick design that was very popular in the 70s and 80s.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:21.000
And not like the bizarreness that was the ColecoVision controller later on.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
Okay stop for a moment.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:32.000
Why did mid to late 80s machines have the worst controllers ever?

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
When the joystick is so perfect.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
Why?

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:40.000
What is it about the 80s that made people lose their shit when it came to controller design?

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
I just figured it was new. People didn't know what to do.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:46.000
We're gonna put a phone pad on it. Thanks Coleco.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:53.000
Anyway, but the joystick for this was very simple. You had your button, you had your joystick. That's all you needed.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
And we liked it.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:32:05.000
One of the other neat things though about this system is that it had a speech synthesis unit too.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:08.000
Which was pretty neat for its time, you know.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:13.000
And one of the things like what we're listening to right now is a game.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
And I've done the game before for Classic Game.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
It's Quest for the Rings.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:21.000
Where you had a board game that you played along with a video game.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:25.000
Although we would always just say fuck the board game and just play the video game.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
Because playing the changeling was always the fun part.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:30.000
That's like playing the Clue VCR game. Fuck the game, let's just watch the dumb movie.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:33.000
Just watch the Clue movie that doesn't have Tim Curry.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:41.000
And there were a few other games that were like Conquest of the World and The Great Wall Street Fortune Hunt.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
And each of them were like that too.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:53.000
And I will say the Atari 2600, the Intellivision, its other competitor at the time was the Bally Astrocade.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:56.000
Which I might go in for a system one.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:01.000
But this one, it had a pretty decent market share.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
It was the third runner, but it wasn't bad, you know.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:07.000
In the US, it sold pretty well.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:16.000
And it was actually one of the main ones that was selling pretty well right before 1982.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:23.000
Over a million, by 1983, over a million Odyssey 2 units were sold in just the US.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
And like I said, it was all over the world.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:33.000
There were no third party games until 1983, which was Imagic's Demon Attack.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:38.000
So that really did limit what it could do with the lack of third party support.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:41.000
Pay attention to Nintendo sometimes.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:54.000
But then again, you know, there were other releases like Popeye, Frogger, Qbert, Super Cobra, and then Atlantis where there were some other big ones.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:34:02.000
As far as international releases, it did get released in Japan as the Odyssey 2.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:06.000
It was kind of successful. Not very.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:10.000
And finding a Japanese Odyssey 2 is actually really difficult.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:13.000
It had a decent release in Brazil.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:16.000
They had tournaments for Casey's Crazy Chase.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
It was called ComCom there.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:27.000
And then in Europe, of course, it sold very well with a much larger number of games that were released in Europe.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:34.000
The only thing that was interesting about the European models is that they didn't have any power buttons.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:37.000
And that their action buttons on the joysticks were black.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
Which is kind of odd, but hey.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:46.000
Anyway, it had an 8-bit Intel 8048 microcontroller.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:51.000
It ran at a blazing 1.79 megahertz.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:54.000
64 bytes of RAM.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:57.000
Audio RAM was 128 bytes.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:02.000
BIOS ROM was 1024 bytes.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:05.000
I mean, keep in mind, this is bytes.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:09.000
This is the 70s and the 80s.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:13.000
But it was so much fun, you know.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:18.000
There actually is an emulator out there for people who are interested in it.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:23.000
The open source emulator right now is called O2EM.

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:27.000
It also has the video pack emulation for the other games.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:31.000
I mean, it's out for all of the big systems out there.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:39.000
But, you know, if you want to get into basically what I spent my formative years playing, you know, this is it.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:45.000
Now, we used to have mirror matches playing some of the racing games.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:49.000
Like, where we would quite literally look in a mirror and try to play.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:52.000
Oh, that's such a dumb five-year-old thing to do, but I love it.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:58.000
It was great. And the game that I was actually really good at, what was it called?

01:35:58.000 --> 01:35:59.000
Cryptequip?

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:00.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:01.000
Where it was the word scrabble game.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:02.000
Yeah.

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
And then, you know, there was Hangman.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
But, man, I loved that.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
God, why can't I remember the name of the racing game?

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
Because I fucking loved the racing game.

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:14.000
And it was almost like, you know, a little just, you know, lap trap thing.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
But we played a lot of Quest for the Rings.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
A lot of Quest for the Rings.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:24.000
And we would just play for hours with these little blocky looking weird people.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:27.000
And this, it was kind of a dragon. It was Trogdor.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
It was an 8-bit Trogdor.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
You just like to burn an 8.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:37.000
Oh, it was great. But, man, you know, I will say this here.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:41.000
We didn't have a 2600. None of my friends had one.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:42.000
Wow.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:47.000
My ex-asshole stepdad, well, he was an asshole still.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:53.000
But my ex-stepdad, his friend had an Atari 2600.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
And I would go play that sometimes.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:37:02.000
But this, the Odyssey 2, I played so much more than an Atari 2600.

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:07.000
I probably played more Atari 2600 as an adult than I did as a child.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:08.000
Hmm.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:14.000
But, yeah, this was the one that was big for me, was the Odyssey 2.

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:15.000
All right.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:16.000
Hey.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:20.000
There it is, your classic system of the month, the Odyssey 2.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:23.000
And I must confess, a system I have not really spent a lot of time with.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:24.000
I have one.

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
You should bring one over. It'll be fun.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
You don't have a TV that it'll connect to.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:32.000
Oh, is there a box that can convert the signal to HDMI?

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:33.000
There's got to be.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:38.000
I have a VHF to UF converter, a VHS, no.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:39.000
VHS.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:40.000
What am I saying?

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:41.000
No, I know what you mean.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
The little, the coaxial thingy, because of the old.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:44.000
Yeah.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:45.000
Yeah, it's a coax to HDMI, basically.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:52.000
But this one ran off of, if I remember right, it was the little hook that you screwed them into.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:53.000
The RF.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:54.000
Yeah.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:55.000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:38:01.000
We've got a converter that we've been using to run the 5200s on that.

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:02.000
So I'll have to find one.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:05.000
Actually, isn't there something about, like, these games won't even really play on an HDMI?

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
Because there's something, I don't know what it is.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:14.000
They come out looking like, well, especially on top of that, you really did have, you know, still crazy flicker.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:17.000
You know, they didn't run very quickly.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:25.000
And these screens will try to, like, do, like, some sort of upscaling to it that just makes it kind of a blurry effect.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:33.000
And when, like, even for our NES, when we hook it up to our TV, there's probably a two second delay in what you do and what you see.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:40.000
That's why when we were live streaming and I was trying to play Guardian Legend, I couldn't play.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:43.000
The delay was just way too terrible.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:48.000
So I'm actually, I'm actually, like, Googling, like, play Atari 2600 on HDTV.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:53.000
Because, I mean, I just figure more people are going to be looking at Atari 2600 because that was the system there.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:59.000
But some people are saying here, like, I guess I got, I got looped over to a forum or something like that.

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
And people are saying everything will work fine.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:05.000
The RCA is interchangeable. The AV inputs on your TV are not good ideas.

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:08.000
They're not going to pick up the signal, but there's no harm on your TV.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
But there might be a little lag, it sounds like.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:13.000
Yeah, the lag is the worst part of it for me.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:17.000
But I did notice, like, some blurring, you know, a little bit of blurring.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:21.000
So, and it just could just be that it's so much smoother, you know.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:22.000
All right.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
Okay, well, we're going to take a break.

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:29.000
But when we come back, there is more of Orange Lounge Radio to come, including rapid fire news, what's in stores this week.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:34.000
And we'll get to a few more news stories, hopefully all before 9 o'clock and the Bethesda press conference.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:37.000
I think some of you guys are going to be watching as E3 continues.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:38.000
Don't go anywhere, guys.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:41.000
We'll be right back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:50.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:55.000
Live tonight, episode 690 of our show for this June the 11th of 2017.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:40:02.000
We're having a fun show so far. E3 is underway and there's some good, some not so good.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:05.000
But, you know, at least there's something to be excited about somewhere.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
It's a great time to be a gamer.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
It's always funny because everybody likes to ask that question.

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:12.000
Who won E3 this year? Who is the big winner?

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:16.000
Well, ultimately, if gamers aren't the winner, then we had a bad show.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:20.000
They haven't been really blown, like, knocked out of park.

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:26.000
Okay, but everybody's hoping for another thing where Sony just fucking drags Microsoft by the hair

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
and pulls them through the parking lot.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:34.000
Honestly, I would like to see something from Sony to that effect

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:38.000
because right now it seems like the dragging is being done by Microsoft right now.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
Well, come on, Logie.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:44.000
Microsoft's had a turn and Sony hasn't. It's way too early to say that.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:47.000
But I want to see something I like from everybody.

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:52.000
I would like to see games with trailers that are actually coming out this year

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:57.000
instead of games that they showed us for the last four years that are, oh yeah, you know?

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
Fair enough, fair enough.

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:02.000
Alright, we're going to get into some rapid fire news here

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:06.000
and before too long we'll be getting your calls at Orange Launch Radio on Skype.

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
But as a reminder, it may be a little bit of a shorter show tonight

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:12.000
because, well, we were thinking that Bethesda was going to interrupt the show

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
and I just found out today they weren't.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:18.000
So, whoops, I guess bad planning on my part, but that's alright.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
I know it's a busy week for you guys.

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
So let's get into rapid fire news. Logie.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:26.000
So, I'm a little frustrated by this news

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:29.000
and the reason why, you may remember Volition.

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:32.000
They're the makers of Saints Row, that series.

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:35.000
But now they have a new game called Agents of Mayhem that's coming out.

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:38.000
It's a different game. It's not Saints Row.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:41.000
It's not supposed to be Saints Row.

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:44.000
But now it's Saints Row. But now it's like Saints Row.

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:49.000
Because, like, seriously, they're like, okay, yeah, it doesn't necessarily...

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:52.000
It's like, maybe in the same universe.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:55.000
Like, you know, the Saints stuff is kind of there.

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:58.000
And then now they pull this shit.

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:04.000
Basically, as a pre-order bonus, you get a playable character of Johnny Gat.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
And apparently it's supposed to be within canon

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:10.000
because Gat is back from, you know, after the events from Gat Out of Hell.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:14.000
He fell into a coma and woke up in this world.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:20.000
Okay. But that just pisses me off more that there's not a fucking new Saints Row game.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:23.000
And there's this. But it's not Saints Row.

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:27.000
But if this has the humor of Saints Row, wouldn't you still be okay with it?

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:32.000
No, because they wanted me to be okay when Saints Row was like a superhero game.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:36.000
It's not a superhero game. It was a knockoff of Grand Theft Auto.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:40.000
Like, okay, you are fucking kidding yourself if you don't think you're giving this game a chance.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
And buy it when it comes out. Come on.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
No, I don't know. I wasn't really interested in it.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
Oh, my God. All right.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
It's got Johnny Gat in it, though.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
Surprised we didn't see it today, actually.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:55.000
I would have thought the Microsoft thing would have been a place to show this, but I guess not.

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:59.000
I mean, I don't know. It's all right. It's just, it's kind of silly.

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:04.000
I mean, I guess that's what Saints Row is, but it just seems cheap.

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
I don't know. I don't know what to think of it.

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
All right. Let's move on.

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
And then this is kind of cool.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:18.000
So there's this game that came out called Jazzpunk that's a pretty silly first person puzzle game.

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:23.000
And they're finally getting DLC for it, which is weird because it came out like three years ago.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:29.000
And now they're finally putting out some DLC in the form of a director's cut that's coming.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:35.000
They're saying that's Flavor Nexus is the expansion pack that's coming out.

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:42.000
And yeah, I mean, I guess, I don't know. I'm down for that because I actually like Jazzpunk.

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:48.000
I need to go back and finish it, but it's a really strange, like, I don't really know how to describe it.

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:52.000
It's kind of like a James Bond-ish type game, but it's not.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:57.000
It's like really like weird humor, but it's definitely worth checking it out.

01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:02.000
Dungeon Muster knows this game in chat over at live.vognetwork.com and says, LOL, it was such a funky game.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:06.000
It is. It's a really weird game. It's really worth checking out.

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
But hey, DLC this long after the fact.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:09.000
Yeah, I'll pick it up.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:13.000
What a way to remind people about your game and kind of give it a second life, right?

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:14.000
Right.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:15.000
That's pretty cool.

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:19.000
All right. Anyhow, Housemarque is giving away a game on Steam

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:22.000
because they're trying to promote their next release, Next Machina.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:25.000
So they are giving away one of their older games.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:30.000
You might know them from Resogun and Super Stardust, but this is something they're giving away on Steam.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:34.000
It's Outland, so you can find that available on Steam.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:41.000
That is going to be, I think that you can only do that through, when was it? Oh, is that already done?

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:46.000
Never mind. Time's up. Well, this was a timely announcement, wasn't it?

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:47.000
Sorry.

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
So guess what? You missed a free game.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:50.000
Shame.

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
Maybe, sorry about that.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:57.000
Maybe you should follow CheapAssGamer because you'll get notified a lot.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:02.000
Or one of those people that do the updates regularly on those game sales.

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:07.000
But well, you know what? Hey, it's still a reminder that they do have this new game coming out

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
and it's something they're highlighting at E3.

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:14.000
And hey, who gives away games to support their upcoming release?

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:15.000
I mean, you don't hear about that every day.

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:18.000
It's not the first time that's been done, but you don't hear about that every day.

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
Usually you have to pre-order that to get it.

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:25.000
Anyhow, moving on to this one I'm very excited about.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:33.000
There was a trailer that was released this past week for Dissidia Final Fantasy NT coming to PlayStation 4.

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:38.000
This, of course, Dissidia being the Final Fantasy fighting title, but I believe...

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:39.000
Is this the arcade one?

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:43.000
Yeah, pretty much. It's going to be the arcade one, but now on PlayStation 4.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:44.000
I'm down.

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:49.000
They released these games on PSP a long time ago, so it's kind of like one of those...

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:55.000
It's about fucking time we get this on PlayStation 4, especially with how well this has been doing in the arcades.

01:45:55.000 --> 01:46:00.000
So it will be coming out in early 2018, although we don't have a direct day yet.

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:06.000
But there is supposed to be some type of press event at the E3 Coliseum on June 13th of 3.15

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:10.000
and I'm going to assume they are showing more about this game at that time.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:19.000
Of course, if you see the trailer, it's very Square Enix, very Final Fantasy, over-the-top, opera singers, all that pomp and circumstance.

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:23.000
And it's great. I can't wait to get this game because I've been wanting to play it.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:27.000
You can't really find this in arcades around here. I don't even think round one has it.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:32.000
DungeonBuster says, can you fight as Final Fantasy XV's flying car?

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:39.000
No, but I think they put in Noctis as a down-low or some type of character after the fact.

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:45.000
Because you know that a lot of Japanese arcade games now are just like mobile games on fucking steroids.

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:50.000
So it's like, you know, they patch it in.

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:53.000
Yeah, a lot of it. You have cards that remember who you are.

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:59.000
I thought some of them used your cell phone, but I guess somebody figured out that the cards make more money or something, I don't know.

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
But yeah, pretty cool.

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:04.000
Moving on, DarkSakura.

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:08.000
Well, Shenmue 3, of course, we know it made its Kickstarter.

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:12.000
But we haven't really found out too much since then.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:16.000
So we had it on the news delivered by Yu Suzuki himself.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:23.000
He said that they must delay the release because the game has become bigger and more beautiful than initially expected.

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:27.000
So it set back for the end of 2018.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:31.000
Highly anticipated game gets delayed. What a shock, right?

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
At least it wasn't butchered like Mighty No. 9.

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:37.000
That makes a perfect candidate for a trailer at the Sony press conference, right?

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
I guess, but why...

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
I would rather wait for something good.

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
Yeah, I would rather wait till next year's conference.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:46.000
Well, that's what I'm saying is because they tend to put trailers out for games that aren't coming out for a while.

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:47.000
Oh, I see.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:52.000
It was a cerebral joke that went over my head, I'm sorry.

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:55.000
And in other news, PlayStation...

01:47:55.000 --> 01:48:00.000
Well, Sony is a sponsor for London Pride this year.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:08.000
So the PlayStation UK posted the hashtag for all capital A-L-L, the players.

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:11.000
So I think that that's pretty good. We need...

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:14.000
Wish they'd do it for more things here.

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:20.000
But hey, that's going to be for London Pride, which is July 8th.

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
Yay.

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:26.000
Yeah, that's awesome that Sony is getting involved with that.

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:27.000
Good guy, Sony.

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:34.000
So to be fair, though, Microsoft gets involved with these types of causes quite frequently as well.

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:38.000
Don't think I've seen Nintendo.

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:44.000
I'm using a big question mark with that because I'm trying to think.

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:47.000
Didn't Nintendo sponsor GamerX4?

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
They might have.

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
So anyway, but you know what I mean.

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
They just see them as often, but it's still cool.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
All right.

01:48:55.000 --> 01:49:00.000
JD in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says Nintendo likes to avoid gay entirely.

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:03.000
Case in point, Tomodachi life.

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:08.000
Yeah, but didn't Nintendo kind of fess up that they made a mistake there?

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:12.000
I'm a lot better with it when a company says,

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:19.000
sorry, we'll do better next time than, well, fuck off type of thing.

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
There's kind of one or two ways that can go, right?

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:24.000
So if a company says sorry and we'll do better next time,

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:28.000
I'm willing to stop attacking them over it, if that makes sense.

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
But anyway, let's move on.

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:34.000
On to happier news. What can we find in stores this week? Loki?

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
Not a whole lot, to be honest.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:42.000
So we've got Cars 3 Driven to Win, the franchise game for the movie coming out on this Friday.

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:50.000
So we've got it on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, Xbox One, Xbox 360, the Nintendo Switch, and the Wii U.

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:54.000
And then finally, one other game coming out on the Switch this week.

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:59.000
Arms is making its way out on Friday. That's it.

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:02.000
Oh my God, that's right. Arms is this week, huh?

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:03.000
Yeah.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:06.000
There's some people I know that are very, very, very excited about that, that's for sure.

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:10.000
All right, well, my website where I do the Japanese releases is having some issues.

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:14.000
So let's go over, can we go to the UK ones real quick?

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:18.000
Sure. There are some UK releases.

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:23.000
On the 14th, we have Pixel Heroes, Byte and Magic, because I thought it was a cool name.

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:27.000
And on the 15th, MotoGP 17. That's it.

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:31.000
All right. Unfortunately, I am not able to tell you what's coming out in Japan this week.

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:34.000
So I'm going to have to table that to a later time.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:35.000
Stuff.

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:38.000
Yeah, more stuff. Yeah, I'm not getting my list that usually comes up.

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
So that's okay. Websites go up and they go down.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:44.000
So yeah, please look forward to it.

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
Yeah, look forward to it.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:51.000
Surprise things they announced during E3 this week. That's what's going to be coming out of Japan.

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:54.000
Sorry, guys. All right, moving on.

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
We're going to go ahead and skip over the mailbag this week.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:59.000
But we do want to encourage you guys to email us in the future.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:02.000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
Just we're skipping it for time tonight.

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:07.000
Remember, our 15th anniversary show is next week.

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:08.000
Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:12.000
So if you're one of those longtime listener, first time caller type of people, we'd really love to hear from you.

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:15.000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:18.000
Not to give you a guilt trip or anything.

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
Stare.

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
Puppy dog eyes.

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:23.000
All right.

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
I'm not going to have a floofy dress, though.

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
No, no Kisenyara dress, unfortunately.

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:31.000
Maybe I'll pick up little plastic tiaras.

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
That would be fun. That would be fun.

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:34.000
All right, moving on.

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:43.000
I did talk about possibly doing a video stream of the 15th anniversary, but I'm not going to have the expense invested in the studio to be able to do that.

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:49.000
But please know that is something I'm looking at for the near future, maybe episode 700 or something.

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
So that we can have something.

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:54.000
I know Jamie doesn't want to be on cam, but we can figure something out.

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
It could happen.

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
She just has to have proper warning.

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:01.000
I'll do the Sia thing with the wig that covers my eyes.

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
I love it. You should.

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:08.000
You should. You know what? You should get a hat that says something.

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
It doesn't say something.

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
That's right. Get a hat that says something.

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:18.000
It'll say something. Literally. S-O-M-E-T-H-I-N-G.

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:21.000
How many fucking guys that dress up in drag do you know?

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:24.000
Like, you've got to know somebody that has a hat that says something.

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:25.000
Girl.

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:26.000
Exactly.

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
It's like I turn around and there's a queen.

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:29.000
Oh, hi.

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
You just need to get a Carmen Sandiego fedora.

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:34.000
I think she should change it up every week.

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
She should have a big hat every week that's like changing.

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
One week she has a Carmen Sandiego fedora.

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
One week she has a Sia wig.

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
I mean, this could get expensive, but it's funny.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:43.000
Fuck.

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
Who was it that...

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
Oh, shit. Now I'm thinking of a show.

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:50.000
Where you used to have like different glasses or something every week.

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:54.000
Dame Edna.

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:55.000
Is that who you're thinking of?

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:56.000
No. Wasn't Dame Edna.

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:57.000
Hello, my puppets!

01:52:57.000 --> 01:53:00.000
Dame Edna's always had the Reinstein cat eyeglasses.

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
Is anyone in chat old enough to know who Dame Edna is?

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:03.000
Probably not.

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:04.000
Dame Edna ever...

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:07.000
I'm betting JD. JD would know who Dame Edna is, if anybody.

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:11.000
Although I do have some problems with Dame Edna lately for having some very translated things.

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:16.000
That's true. Sorry. I forgot that she has definitely put her foot up her fucking mouth recently.

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
So, sorry about that. I forgot.

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:23.000
I like to remember a Dame Edna from the 70s that was a lot different.

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:24.000
Yeah.

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:25.000
Yes.

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:26.000
All right.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:29.000
Anyhow, movie... JD says, I've read about Dame Edna.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
Yeah, probably those same stories you're referring to.

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
Anyway, moving on.

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:37.000
Let's get to some other news stories to end things out.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:38.000
Loki.

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
So, things are definitely changing with Pokemon Go.

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:45.000
So, we kind of hinted at a few things that might be happening through speculation and stuff.

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:48.000
But now, we kind of have a little bit of something more concrete.

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:54.000
So, we know that the gym system is going to be redone because the gyms are going offline shortly.

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:57.000
So, they're going to be doing an event soon on June 13th.

01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:01.000
It's the Solstice event. So, they're going to be doing extra XP for players.

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:06.000
Not only that, but they're going to be adding more fire and ice type Pokemon.

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:09.000
Finally, I can involve my stupid Charmeleon, who'll be nice.

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:12.000
Also, they're going to reduce the price of Lucky Eggs.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:16.000
So, if you want to quadruple your XP, you can do that.

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
Would you like to play Lucky Egg?

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
No.

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:27.000
And then, of course, with that, they're going to be adding, they said, collaborative group gameplay features.

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:31.000
This is that will get you playing Pokemon Go in new, fun ways.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:39.000
And they're going to be disabling gyms temporarily before the update, which they don't have a release date yet for that.

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:50.000
And then, on top of that, people who live around Chicago, July 22nd, they're going to be doing the first live Pokemon event there in Grand Park.

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:54.000
They say it's going to feature a ton of exciting festivities.

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
Lucky for those people in Chicago.

01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:01.000
Tickets for that event go on sale on June 19th at 10pm Pacific.

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:05.000
Thank you for doing it three weeks after I plan to be there, assholes.

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:08.000
No, it's fine. They can't do them everywhere at once.

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:14.000
I'm going to be so mad if they do a legendary at the event, and then it's like, ugh.

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:23.000
I like to follow on Reddit, Silfrode, when I want to get theory in Pokemon Go, because they're very good at analyzing all this shit.

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:30.000
And they seem to think there is some type of partnership thing going on with Pokemon Go, that there's going to be more of these events throughout the U.S.

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
That's just kind of ran by a different organization.

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:38.000
And, to be fair, Ingress is doing something right now with that, with the GORUCK organization.

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
They have this thing called Operation Clear Field.

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:47.000
And that's going all over the country and doing, it's like a scavenger hunt type thing with some minor physical fitness built into it.

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:54.000
Not community service, but park awareness. Your parks are here, support them and all that stuff.

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:58.000
You mean keeping your parks clean and not driving through them in the middle of the rain?

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:03.000
Yes, like some Smurfs we know. But anyway, no team is perfect.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:08.000
But anyway, all that aside, what was I going to say about Clear Field?

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:11.000
Clear Field is going to be here for two days. They're doing two days in Sacramento.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:14.000
I was like, there's not enough people here that want to do that.

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:20.000
I played the other day, briefly. I was at the park. My kids were sitting there.

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:24.000
They were riding their bikes in the tennis court. And there happens to be a portal nearby.

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:31.000
It was a gym as well. It's like a level 12 gym. I'm like, nah, I'm not going to try to take this thing down.

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
So I captured the portal and linked.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:36.000
So that way it made you feel better because at least you got something.

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:46.000
I emptied out my MUFG things so they can fill themselves up again with useless crap that I'm not going to use.

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:49.000
I don't play as much as I used to.

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000
I played briefly. And it was weird though.

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:56.000
The day-to-day in that game has gotten stale. I really like the group events.

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:59.000
I'll farm with other people and give the burst to steal the needle.

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:04.000
I don't know who else is still playing, but the people that normally take down my stuff immediately.

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:08.000
I went back there because I turned off my notifications because I just don't care anymore.

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:14.000
And then I checked the day after and I was like, damn, it's still there. Why is it still there?

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:17.000
I'm surprised that normally it still gets taken down immediately.

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:20.000
I think the player base is just shifting a little bit.

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:24.000
Some people are still gung-ho on it. Some people are getting really burned out on it.

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
And I'm kind of in the hole like, you know...

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
Maybe when 2.0 comes out.

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:36.000
That's where I'm at. I still like the incentive to get out and walk and gamify my walk.

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
So I still will play for that.

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:45.000
But once in a while I can be talked into getting into the car to drop something that's really ugly.

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:52.000
But I'm really more about, let's group up with other people and do something together like a big field.

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
Or let's do a farm.

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:58.000
I like to do the social stuff still, but that's kind of where I'm at right now.

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:03.000
But if Pokemon Go is going to get more social like that, to tie this back to Pokemon Go.

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:07.000
If Pokemon Go is going to get more social like that with whatever this gym replacement thing is,

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
then that's a great thing for the game, I think.

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:16.000
Some of the most fun times I've had in Ingress is getting in a car with three other nerds

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:20.000
and building portals downtown, up and down all the streets downtown,

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
that you know the other team is going to have to spend all night taking down.

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:27.000
That is some of the most fun I've had, because it's more of a social thing.

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:31.000
So if they can give that to Pokemon, I think that'll be pretty cool.

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:36.000
Yes, you can do it for gyms, but it's not that exciting, I'm sorry to say.

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:40.000
At the end of the day, only two people can really do anything with a gym at the time.

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:43.000
You can do groups of two people, but it's not the same.

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
It's not the same.

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:50.000
Alright, anyway, come on, a night like this and chat says,

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:55.000
it's okay girl, on the bright side, you can load up on Chicago dogs and pizza pie.

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:58.000
Believe me, there's going to be a lot of eating in Chicago,

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:02.000
because I like me some deep dish pizza, and you're right, there's a lot of good food in Chicago.

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:06.000
Sadly, that's the type of pizza I dislike.

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:07.000
Oh really?

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:08.000
I hate deep dish pizza.

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:09.000
Oh man, I love it.

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
I hate it, that's my least favorite.

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000
But, and some of the natives are going to get pissed.

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:21.000
But, to be fair, really my only experience with deep dish pizza nearby is a chain that we have, Chicago Fire.

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:22.000
Their pizza sucks.

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:26.000
But a lot of people like their pizza, but I hate their pizza.

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:29.000
So that's maybe, it's just the bad pizza that I'm getting.

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:33.000
Here's the thing with the Chicago pizza, and a lot of the natives are going to be really upset that I say this,

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
but you're just going to have to deal with it.

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:41.000
I do feel like Chicago pizza is one of those things that they have replicated pretty well in other areas.

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:47.000
Like, you can kind of go to chains around here, a place around here and get a pizza that's pretty decent that's like a Chicago pizza.

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.000
A New York pizza on the other hand?

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000
I have a very hard time finding that around here.

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:52.000
Just saying.

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
There's like one place I know of that does a pretty darn good job.

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
But that's like it.

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
So, anyway.

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:01.000
I could get on a tangent about food.

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
That would just be another week here at OLR.

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000
We do still have some gaming news to get to.

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000
So why not another Minecraft story?

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
Let's talk about Minecraft season 2.

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
We kind of talked about this last week.

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:15.000
It did come up on the show, but last week was a rumor, now it's official.

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:19.000
The next season of Minecraft, so now it's season 2.

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:20.000
Story mode.

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
Story mode, yes, will be next month.

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
A lot of the first season people are returning.

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:27.000
Patton Oswalt, Catherine Tabor, Ashley Johnson, Scott Porter.

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:30.000
There's also going to be cameos from Minecraft YouTubers.

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
Stampycat and StacyPlays.

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:35.000
They've sort of already done that, but yeah, it's neat.

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
I have no idea who they are, but cool, cool, I guess.

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:42.000
The first episode is called Hero in Residence, and there's five planned episodes.

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:45.000
And it will be available on July 11th.

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
Of course, it will follow the events of the first season.

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:50.000
The gang are now known as Renowned Adventures.

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:54.000
And this game looks like it's even better than Minecraft in 4K with the graphics.

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:58.000
But obviously they take liberties with a lot of the Minecraft universe in this.

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
But that's cool.

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
You know, the Telltale games are fun.

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:05.000
I never played Minecraft season 1, but it's one of those things that's like

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:08.000
on a rainy day, someday, I'll have time to get around to this.

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
But it just hasn't happened yet.

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:13.000
So, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000
I have stuff.

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:21.000
So, Indie Mega Booth has transformed.

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:25.000
There's now Roving Mega Shoaf...

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:29.000
I can't make words happen. What is up with this?

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:32.000
Mega Shoaf Festival, oh my god.

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:38.000
So, anyway, it's going to happen on July 15th in Atlanta.

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:47.000
And it will be Indie and local community content to basically all work together for happiness.

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:53.000
There will be PlayStation and Adult Swim games there to help with game creation.

02:01:53.000 --> 02:02:01.000
And they are taking submissions for local artists, musicians, and developers who want to participate.

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:08.000
And the announcer of the full lineup will be on June 13th, the day the tickets go on sale.

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:12.000
So, people go and tell us what you think.

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:18.000
Because I can't teleport to Atlanta. Sorry.

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:21.000
If only we knew somebody who was in Atlanta.

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:25.000
Yeah, I wonder who.

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000
Hopefully he'll have time in his schedule to do that.

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:30.000
Alright, but if not, maybe somewhere else.

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
Alright, just a few more stories for you guys.

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:35.000
Then we're going to open up the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio. Loki.

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:39.000
So, one of the games that they showed a long time ago,

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:43.000
I want to say when they were unveiling Unreal Engine 4, was Fortnite.

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
It was supposed to be this new epic game.

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:49.000
And now that's supposed to be coming out pretty soon, actually.

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:55.000
They're going to be doing an early access release of it on July 25th for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

02:02:55.000 --> 02:03:01.000
Now, for those who don't remember, Fortnite was this kind of zombie survival game.

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:04.000
But you actually build up your own forts and everything.

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:10.000
So, you build up your bases, craft weapons, and then survive waves of zombies and stuff.

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:13.000
And then you go out and scavenge and stuff like that. It looks kind of cool.

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:16.000
So, that's going to be coming out relatively soon.

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:19.000
And it's going to be $39.99 when it releases.

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000
So, check it out, I guess.

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000
I probably will check it out.

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000
Or don't.

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:28.000
I don't care if you don't want to.

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:31.000
What am I here for? Just to tell you this stuff? I mean, seriously.

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:36.000
Dungeon Buster says, wow, Fortnite. That's a title I haven't heard anything from in a long while.

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:42.000
So, Bobby Blackwolf in chat is there and says, LOL, I probably already know all the people exhibiting there.

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:45.000
I hadn't heard of it though, so they haven't announced it locally.

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:46.000
So, hmm.

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
Alright, anyhow. One more story for you guys tonight.

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:51.000
And it's about an old favorite here at OLR.

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:54.000
An old favorite. Former favorite here at OLR.

02:03:54.000 --> 02:04:00.000
Which, you know, to be fair, we wouldn't be here for these past 15 years if it weren't without Konami.

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
So, I have a Konami story to end things tonight.

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:10.000
And there was an interview at MikeTendo64 doing an interview with a European brand manager named Richard Jones over at Konami.

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:14.000
And there's some highlights of this interview talking about, of course, Switch support.

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:15.000
Jones says in this interview,

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:23.000
All I can say is that there's lots of internal discussions going on within Konami regarding what games we can bring to the Nintendo Switch other than Bomberman.

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:27.000
A game which we are well aware of its heritage and how loved it and Castlevania is.

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:30.000
So much that Castlevania is getting its own show on Netflix.

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:35.000
And because of that, we're hearing a lot of desires from our fans for a new Castlevania series.

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:42.000
So, we do know there is a demand for a new game, but right now, nothing is set in stone as the discussions are still ongoing.

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:48.000
Hey, that reminds me. Did you see the new Bloodstained trailer out of E3? Because that game looked pretty hot. Did you see that?

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:49.000
No, I did not.

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:53.000
Oh, yeah. It looks like fucking Symphony of the Night, which we were all expecting.

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:57.000
But with some enhanced graphics stuff, which we were kind of expecting.

02:04:57.000 --> 02:05:01.000
So, I feel like this game may actually just be delivering what people want. So, we'll see.

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:02.000
I hope so.

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:05.000
Hopefully, we don't get Mighty No. 9, but it's looking pretty good so far.

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000
Oh, excuse me. Back to Konami.

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000
There was also a question about Bomberman R.

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:19.000
While I can't say how long for we will continue to support Super Bomberman R, I can say we do have plenty of other ideas in the works and have a few big updates on the way.

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:22.000
For example, I can't announce anything for version 1.5.

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:25.000
Disfficed to say there will be more stages and other things.

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:31.000
But although I can't confirm there will be more costumes and characters, there may or may not be some more later on down the line.

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:32.000
We'll just have to see how it goes.

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:35.000
That's the biggest fucking non-answer answer I've ever heard in my life.

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:43.000
Like, there's a version update I can't confirm or deny, but I'm gonna tell you that we're gonna see what happens.

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:47.000
So, look forward to this, because I think you may or may not like it.

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:51.000
Right?

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:53.000
Whatever. It's fine.

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:56.000
All I hear is they're gonna release another fucking Frogger game, probably.

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:59.000
It's just gonna be like, no one fucking cares.

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:00.000
Loki, it's what the fans want.

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:04.000
I get it. Old Frogger is cool. New Frogger, not so cool. Come on.

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
Alright. Well, I don't know. You know what?

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:15.000
Maybe Frogger on the Switch, depending on what they do with it, is something I could get behind.

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:16.000
Maybe.

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:23.000
All they would do if they did Frogger on the Switch is it would just be fucking ripping off Crossy Road at that point.

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:27.000
Which, technically, Crossy Road sort of rips off of Frogger, but that's basically what it would be.

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:31.000
Dark Tetsuya suggests, how about Frogger Fractions?

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000
I'm down with that. That's fine.

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:38.000
Oh my god. Can you imagine if Konami had the balls to release Frogger Fractions?

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:42.000
Can you imagine just to put out that type of title or that sort of name?

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:45.000
Can you imagine if Konami had the fucking balls to do something like that?

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:47.000
They won't. They don't.

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:51.000
Alright. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:58.000
If you want to give us a call, we're gonna take a few quick calls before, of course, gonna shut it down,

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000
because Bethesda's starting in about 30 minutes.

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:05.000
Have they said yet if it's the good old folks from X-Play hosting that whole thing again?

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000
I don't know, but I want to definitely watch it tonight, so...

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000
Yeah. So, we'll see.

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.000
So, let's see. We are getting a call.

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.000
So, we'll get to it quickly here.

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.000
Hi. You're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
Hey, this is Reginator.

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
Hey, Reginator. What's on your mind tonight? Quickly.

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000
Two things real quick.

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:26.000
Question and a bit of information.

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:33.000
Question is, in your wildest dreams, if you could wish for anything,

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:40.000
what would you like to wish to have announced sometime during the rest of E3?

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:44.000
Nintendo puts out the Guardian Legend on Virtual Console for Switch.

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:45.000
I wish.

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:48.000
Do you have a wish?

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:51.000
I want that to be out.

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:52.000
Like...

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000
No stealing my wish.

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000
I'm not stealing. I'm adding to it.

02:07:58.000 --> 02:07:59.000
Firsties.

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:01.000
I'm adding the force of my own wishes to that one.

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000
Say HD Remake.

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:04.000
Ooh.

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:05.000
There you go.

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:06.000
Stealing that.

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:11.000
I would love to see, you know, especially after seeing the last night trailer today,

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.000
let's let these developers make a new Metroid game,

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:16.000
because that game looks fucking sweet.

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:19.000
With that art style, can you imagine a new Metroid game with that, like,

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:21.000
pixelated kick-ass art style?

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:22.000
I'm down with that.

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000
Because I'm a nice fucking person,

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
I'll let Dark Soccer have the Guardian Legend thing,

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
and I'll fall back on F-Zero.

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000
Wow, we all picked something from Nintendo.

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:33.000
Notice how I said, notice I said,

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.000
keep the bar low with Nintendo,

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:38.000
yet here we are just readying ourselves for disappointment.

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:41.000
We've been doing that for years.

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:42.000
I know, that's true.

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:45.000
I want to see not what realistically is going to happen.

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:46.000
I'm sorry.

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000
I'm loving some of these answers in chat over at live.voggenetwork.com.

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:50.000
Bobby Black Wolf says,

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:53.000
Accolade cancels Bubsy and works on Metroid.

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.000
Come on a night like this in chat says,

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:01.000
A Zac Efron 7 Minutes in Heaven Simulator.

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:07.000
Would that be on the Oculus Rift or the HTV Vive?

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000
I don't know, anyway.

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:10.000
What about you?

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000
The tables have turned, Rage Nator.

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:13.000
What about you?

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000
Well, if I could have anything,

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:20.000
I would say that Sony would sell some of the IPs

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000
that they're not doing anything with

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000
and have no intention of doing anything with,

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:27.000
sell it to a company like Valve,

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:30.000
let them publish new entries on Steam,

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:33.000
like for example, the SOCOM series.

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:36.000
Wait, you know what?

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:39.000
You said a word that completely changed my mind

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.000
about in my wildest dreams, in my wildest dreams.

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.000
Okay, here we go, here we go.

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:44.000
New scenario.

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:47.000
Because you said the word Valve,

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:50.000
tomorrow Sony starts their press conference

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:51.000
and you know, what's his name?

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:52.000
That's the president of Sony right now,

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000
walks out on stage and says,

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:55.000
we'd like to thank you

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000
and here we are to celebrate, you know,

02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:58.000
all these years of Sony

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:01.000
and the great launch of the PlayStation 4 Pro

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:04.000
and then suddenly all the lights go out

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000
and then Gabe Newell, lit by a spotlight,

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
walks out on the stage,

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000
pushes the Sony CEO executive,

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000
Asagis says, get the fuck out of here

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:15.000
and then says, half-life three motherfuckers

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:16.000
and then the ceiling opens up

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:19.000
and mics just fall from the ceiling

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000
onto the crowd below

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.000
and it's out on Steam right now.

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:27.000
That is my wildest dream for E3.

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:28.000
How about that?

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000
You officially dropped me on that.

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000
Don't use that word.

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:33.000
Oh, sorry.

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:34.000
That's all right.

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000
What is your second thing you wanted to ask tonight?

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:39.000
Well, you mentioned Outland being free

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:43.000
on Steam temporarily,

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:45.000
but the one thing that you failed to mention

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:50.000
was that PD2 is also free on Steam,

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:54.000
but there's a little asterisk and footnote on that

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:58.000
is for the first five million people that grab it.

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:02.000
You know what, RageNator,

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
you fucking missed your calling.

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:05.000
You need to be one of these,

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.000
look, I respect that you call in

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:08.000
and you are making sure

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:09.000
that we're getting these things on the cheap,

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:13.000
but I think you could be making money off of saving money.

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:14.000
Just think about this.

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:17.000
You could have some type of blog or website,

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000
a cheaper-ass gamer, I don't know,

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.000
but you better think of a more original name

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:24.000
and you could be running some of these deals, RageNator,

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
and you could make a killing.

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:27.000
I'm just saying.

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000
I don't see how I could do it,

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:30.000
but I'll take your word for it.

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:35.000
Don't be like us and never get better over 15 years.

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
All right, I'm gonna let you go, RageNators.

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:39.000
We can try to squeeze in another call.

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:40.000
Take care.

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:41.000
All right, you have a good one.

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:42.000
You too, bye.

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:45.000
All right, 1-877-GAME-OLR,

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:48.000
or username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio,

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.000
if you want to give us a call.

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:51.000
Let's see.

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:53.000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says,

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:56.000
become at Wario64, but not a bot.

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:57.000
Is Wario64 a bot?

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:58.000
I never knew that.

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:02.000
I see a lot of people quoting him all the time.

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:05.000
I did a really...

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:08.000
I don't know if I should talk about this on OLR.

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:09.000
Never mind.

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:12.000
All right, I blocked somebody on Twitter

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:15.000
that gets retweeted into my timeline a lot.

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:16.000
Not him.

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:17.000
Not that Wario64.

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:18.000
I blocked somebody on Twitter

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000
that gets retweeted into my timeline a lot,

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:23.000
and I just don't like this person

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:26.000
because they threw shade at my husband on Twitter,

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:27.000
and I'm sorry.

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:28.000
I don't stand for that.

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:32.000
Every time I see this guy get tweeted into my timeline,

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:33.000
I'm like, that's the asshole

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.000
who had something to say to my husband,

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.000
and so I blocked him so I don't have to see him anymore

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:39.000
get retweeted into my timeline.

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:40.000
Is it Petty?

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
Yes, but if you look into my kitchen,

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
you'll see I'm well-stocked with Petty Crocker,

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:45.000
so it happens.

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:47.000
So there you go.

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:50.000
Anyway, OrangeLoungeRadio,

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:53.000
all one word on Skype if you want to get through.

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:55.000
This is your last chance.

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:59.000
Otherwise, we're going to wrap it up for tonight.

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.000
I guess I can just quickly kind of end on this here,

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.000
or actually, last-minute stories.

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:04.000
Anything you want to get on here?

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000
There's one last thing I wanted to mention.

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:07.000
I forgot to mention it the other week,

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:09.000
but there's this guy Seth Bling on YouTube

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:11.000
who actually came up with this.

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:14.000
They call it the Super Mario World Jailbreak.

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:17.000
It's basically a modified save that he can create.

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:20.000
It creates like a hex editor within Mario World

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
that you can do all sorts of crazy shit,

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:28.000
including they had code to execute the Super NES mouse

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
to actually move stuff around in the game

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
and do all sorts of crazy stuff.

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:33.000
So pretty cool.

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.000
So go check him out, Seth Bling, on YouTube

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:36.000
to see all this stuff.

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.000
In fact, he has some arbitrary code

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
running on the Wii U virtual console version

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
of Super Mario World as well.

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:46.000
Quickly, what do you hope to see from Bethesda tonight, Loki?

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:49.000
I'd be curious to see some more,

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:51.000
like anything, Elder Scrolls, really,

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:53.000
aside from online, I'm not too interested in that.

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:55.000
Do you think we'll see Elder...

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:57.000
You know something that's been strangely absent

02:13:57.000 --> 02:14:00.000
is Skyrim on the Switch.

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
Do you think now's the time to talk about that,

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000
or do you think that's been quietly shelved?

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000
I think it's coming, but maybe,

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000
yeah, maybe we'll see something.

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
I'm not expecting too much from that, though.

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
I'm expecting just, I don't know,

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
it's like the PlayStation 3.

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:15.000
It's Skyrim on the Switch.

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:16.000
It's Skyrim on the Switch.

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:19.000
I mean, it's all right, but like, I don't know.

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:21.000
I swear to God, Bethesda, where are you?

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.000
All you have to do,

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:26.000
you just add a Hyrule temple somewhere,

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:29.000
and I swear to God, you're gonna sell

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:32.000
four times as many copies as you would have otherwise.

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:35.000
Nintendo fans, don't fuck around.

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:39.000
Or if I could have craftable Master Sword or something ridiculous.

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:42.000
I'm serious. If Bethesda is not thinking about this,

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
they fucking should be.

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000
But anyway, that's just my hot take.

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:47.000
Take it or leave it.

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:50.000
I don't think, see, a lot of people are saying Elder Scrolls VI.

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:53.000
No, in fact, they have fucking come out and said it is not,

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:55.000
there is no Elder Scrolls VI this year.

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:58.000
I think the two, no, the two games that they're supposed to be talking about,

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:01.000
there's The Evil Within 2 is one,

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:04.000
and the other one, remember, it was hinted at,

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:07.000
but they didn't really see it because it was like code or something.

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:10.000
The new Wolfenstein game. Remember, there's Wolfenstein.

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
I forget what the hell the subtitle was on it,

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
but there was, I think, a new Wolfenstein game.

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
Yeah, that seems like a given.

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:20.000
I would say the stretch would be the Fallout New Vegas thing.

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:24.000
I would say a Fallout, a Fallout spinoff,

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
I say New Vegas with a big balloon,

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:29.000
Fallout spinoff in Forest Engine would be way more likely

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:32.000
than an Elder Scrolls thing at this point.

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:36.000
The Elder Scrolls focus is on Morrowind expansion for Elder Scrolls Online.

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
That just came out this past week.

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:41.000
So that's their focus on Elder Scrolls right now.

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:44.000
No Elder Scrolls VI tonight. Ain't happening.

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
If it does, I'll be pleasantly surprised.

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:50.000
Again, don't fucking set your bar there because you're going to be mad.

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
Alright.

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
Well, I guess that's going to do it for the show tonight

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
because nobody else is calling in,

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
but I know y'all are getting ready for that conference.

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000
I want to thank you guys so much for listening to our show tonight,

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:04.000
and hey, next week is going to be a very, very special show

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:07.000
that wouldn't be possible without all of you guys.

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:10.000
So, in advance, I just want to say thanks for being here.

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
And as we say every week,

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lawns Radio,

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
tell a friend or two about the show.

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000
Help spread the word about the show where every gamer has a voice

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
because if the voices aren't here for us to use,

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
we can't air them.

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
I've got voices in my head. Does that count?

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
No.

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
Stay tuned to social media throughout the week.

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R, Facebook.com slash Orange Lawns Radio,

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.000
and of course, VOG Network as well.

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000
We're hoping to have some special things throughout the week

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
to sort of announce and some other things we want to do

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:40.000
in preparation for our 15th anniversary episode, so stay tuned.

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:44.000
Meanwhile, let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000
DarkSakura, your final thought.

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
Loki, your final thought tonight.

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
I hope Sony sets it up tomorrow

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
because I don't want to watch trailers for games

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
that they showed last year

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000
and have no sort of, you know,

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000
answer to the backwards compatibility stuff.

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
And my final thought is

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
just set the fucking bar low

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:08.000
and like the game that you like.

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000
E3, there's going to be something you like.

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000
Focus on that.

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
Focus on the thing you like and run with it.

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
We'll see you next week to break down the rest of E3

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
and celebrate 15 years of Orange Lawns Radio.

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000
Until then, be safe. Bye.

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
The views and opinions expressed in this program

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000

those of the staff of Orange Lawns Radio

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
or VOG Network,

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:49.000
but you know they were all still true.

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.000
See you next week.

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000
Thanks for watching!
