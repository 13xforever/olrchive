00:00.000 --> 00:27.000
This week, celebrate naked pixel bodies with the Early Access release of Conan Exiles and a PlayStation VR bug in Dead or Alive Xtreme 3. There's plenty more safe-for-work news to share and it all starts right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:53.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight, episode number 674 for this February the 5th of 2017. My name is Rob Roberts and joining me in studio as always, welcome back, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
Hi.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Hi, how are you?

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
I'm rude.

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
You're rude. Yes, you are rude and hateful and all those things.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Rude, crude and unattractive.

01:02.000 --> 01:07.000
No, you're actually nice. It's a front that she puts on everybody.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
I'm a bitch.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Being in total control of herself.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Yes.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
Yes.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
Yes.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
Or like that song in the 90s. Do kids today remember that song? I'm a bitch.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
I hate that song so much.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Really?

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
Like I hate that song and I hate the What If God Was One of Us song.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
I actually, I, okay, you want to hear?

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
I hate the Blind Melon song too, rest in peace.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
What? I love that song.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
I don't.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
Okay, now you are rude. Never mind.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
Damn.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
We're not talking to you anymore. Say hello to Tech Master, Loki.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Hi.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Hi, Loki. How are you?

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
I'm fine.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
Do you like Blind Melons, No Rain?

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
It's okay.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
Alright, you can stay. Alright, how have you been though? How was your week?

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
I was filled with spending time with the kids.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
That's good.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
Eh.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Don't worry.

01:48.000 --> 01:53.000
You're kind of over it. You want him to be 18 already?

01:54.000 --> 01:59.000
Also say hello to our chat room. Those of you guys that join us every week.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
Live, Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, although not tonight.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
There's this other event that people seem to care about.

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
I mean like Lady Gaga put on a concert and the whole world had to stop.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
But to be fair, it was a really good concert.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
I know, right?

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Yeah.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
That was the best 13 minutes of my life.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
It was pretty good.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
Meanwhile, there's birds murdering some patriots in Houston.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
I don't know what's going on.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
But anyway, I guess that is continuing.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
People who make more than small countries bring in.

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
Bobby was off somewhere tonight beating a drum in response to.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
His hand will probably fall off with all the touchdowns going on.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
So is it Superb Al Birdemic 3?

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
That's right. Yes, Superb Al Birdemic 3. I love it.

02:40.000 --> 02:45.000
But anyway, hi chatters over at live.vognetwork.com.

02:45.000 --> 02:50.000
Let's see, AkumaJP tuning in tonight all the way from Japan saying,

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
Almost forgot it's Monday. Almost break my OLR cycle.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
That's right. It's Monday morning in Japan.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
Good morning, AkumaJP. Hope you're doing well over there.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
Enrageinator telling DarkSakura how it is.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
No rain by Blind Melon is fucking awesome, DarkSakura.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
You tell her. You tell her.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
Anyway, we are here to talk about, of course, video games,

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle over the next about three hours or so.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Or until we're done.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
That's how long this show is. Until we're done.

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
We weren't here last week and I just want to say sorry about that.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
Because usually we try to give you guys like a lot of notice,

03:21.000 --> 03:26.000
especially because I know like AkumaJP or the other folks in our chat right now,

03:26.000 --> 03:31.000
folks will make time in their schedule to be here live to participate with the show

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
and maybe call in and have their chat comments read and so forth.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
So last week we had to cancel at the last minute.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
I was sick, y'all. There's just really nothing to do about it.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
Had a really nasty sinus thing going on.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
And it was one of those things was like there was no way I was going to be able to talk for three hours.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
I know y'all understand, but still I still I feel bad about it.

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
And then my co-hosts don't want to be anywhere near me because they don't want to get sick.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
That's all right. The kids were all sick.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
I came by anyway.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
I was like, actually, yeah, Jamie came by for a minute anyway.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
I thought about doing mini-OLR.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
I brought you coffee.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
But yeah, she brought me coffee and other hot drinks to make me feel better.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
And, Loki, your kids were sick anyway.

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
Yeah, they're still sick and my wife's sick and I'm fine for right now.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
For right now.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
Until it's set to inconvenience me the most, which will probably be in a couple days.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
Yeah, there still may be germs laying around the house, so be careful.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
But the good news is if you need something to sterilize the germs,

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
I have this lovely wine that I picked up yesterday that has alcohol in it.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
And alcohol kills germs.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
So that's why you should drink some of it.

04:29.000 --> 04:34.000
Anyway, let's get into some gaming news to start off this week.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
Let's catch up on some things we missed last week.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
We have some stories from last week peppered throughout the show.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Some big stuff that came up.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
But I thought we'd start with one tonight about what's going on with Xbox One.

04:43.000 --> 04:49.000
I mean, we start off a lot of shows lately, anyway, talking about the Switch and what's going on there.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
We have some big PS4 stuff coming up.

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
But we don't show the Xbox One enough love here on the show, so here we go.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Going to open with an Xbox One story tonight.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
Although, maybe this isn't love, I don't know.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
I want to know what you guys feel about this.

05:02.000 --> 05:08.000
Snap Mode officially confirmed that Snap Mode will be going away this week.

05:08.000 --> 05:14.000
Soon, sorry, it was confirmed this past week, that Xbox One's Snap feature will be going away.

05:14.000 --> 05:21.000
And I believe some people are starting to see it as part of this update that they get with the beta program and so forth.

05:21.000 --> 05:26.000
There's a tweet out there from Mike Ybarra from Xbox who says,

05:26.000 --> 05:36.000
We replaced Snap to improve multitasking, reduce memory use, improve overall speed, and free up resources going forward for bigger things.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
What could that be?

05:37.000 --> 05:44.000
Anyhow, Snap Mode, if you don't have an Xbox One or you weren't using it, it was a big thing when Kinect was around

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
because you could literally use your hands to snap things, although they replaced it with controller features.

05:48.000 --> 05:55.000
And it was a way that you could watch TV while you were actually, that's why they had the TV bypass on the Xbox One.

05:55.000 --> 06:00.000
So you could actually watch TV in the corner, like in a small corner, while you are playing a video game, so you can multitask.

06:00.000 --> 06:08.000
But another big feature that I know some people are going to feel the pain of a little bit is that some folks were using it for Twitch.

06:08.000 --> 06:16.000
And by snapping Twitch to the side of the screen, you could stream your game via Twitch and see your chat comments.

06:16.000 --> 06:22.000
Now you'll still be able to stream via Twitch, that's not going away, it's just going to run in the background, kind of like I guess the PlayStation 4 does it.

06:22.000 --> 06:31.000
But the PlayStation 4 is set up differently because Sony kind of built in that screen thing into their firmware basically.

06:31.000 --> 06:37.000
Which I would love to see that even more customizable, but I'm getting on a tangent there, this is about Microsoft.

06:37.000 --> 06:43.000
So you're not going to be able to see the chat comments anymore because Snap isn't going to work the same way.

06:43.000 --> 06:51.000
Now to be fair, Microsoft or Twitch may release an updated version of this that would allow something similar to what we see on Sony's system.

06:51.000 --> 06:57.000
Where you can kind of flip back and forth between modes where the chat is built in and so forth.

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
But for right now, with this, you're not going to be able to see chat when you do Twitch.

07:01.000 --> 07:07.000
Unless of course, you do a second screen. I know I've done that when I've done streaming on PlayStation 4.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
I mean I don't stream a lot a lot, but I have done streaming from PlayStation 4.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
I distinctly remember I did a No Man's Sky stream when that game first came out.

07:13.000 --> 07:18.000
And because that game has really, you know, graphics were a big selling point of that game.

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
I wanted to do full screen with no camera or anything, just me kind of messing around.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
And so what I did is I did chat comments on my iPad.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
So I used like a second screen to be able to see comments.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
But I realize not everybody certainly has that ability.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
So those are just some of the features that Snap mode had.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
There's also the music player and so on.

07:36.000 --> 07:42.000
So I'm just curious what you guys think about Snap mode going away.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
Is that a good thing? Is that a bad thing?

07:44.000 --> 07:49.000
I don't know. But I know my co-host here in studio, neither one of you own an Xbox One, right?

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
No, I don't.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
So it's not like you really had a chance to use this anyway.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
I wouldn't have used it probably anyway.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
But what you're hearing about it, what do you think?

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
I just don't think that was very utilized and so it's not a big deal.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
And they'll have something to replace it, so who cares?

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
What do you mean by something to replace it? Do you think-

08:05.000 --> 08:10.000
Well, they said in the comment that they have something that's going to be replacing it for multitasking and stuff.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
I see.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
Maybe they'll have something that works better than that.

08:14.000 --> 08:21.000
The new alt-tab feature to bring your Windows 10 and your Xbox One experience closer together.

08:21.000 --> 08:27.000
Well, they still don't have those universal apps yet, aside from some of the games and stuff.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
Yeah, some of the games.

08:28.000 --> 08:33.000
But they don't have a lot of the app stuff available.

08:33.000 --> 08:38.000
It's supposed to be, oh, hey, you developed it for the Windows 10 marketplace and there you go.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
You can run it on your Xbox One or something.

08:41.000 --> 08:45.000
Would I be able to run PowerPoints on my Xbox One? That might be something.

08:45.000 --> 08:50.000
I'm not sure why I would ever do that, but I'd just like to know that I can. Who knows?

08:50.000 --> 08:57.000
Tigerclaw in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says they are removing Snap to boost system performance.

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
They should have researched that when they were working on it.

09:01.000 --> 09:06.000
And let's see, AkumaJP in chat says, what is this one thing you guys are talking about?

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
I'm not sure it exists in Japan, AkumaJP.

09:09.000 --> 09:14.000
If it does, you might have to ask at the electronics store and it might be in the back.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
There might be one in a closet somewhere.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
Like, check next to the cleaning supplies.

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
That might be where the Xboxes are in Japan. I don't know.

09:24.000 --> 09:31.000
Kaijuto also in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, I've never even heard of Snap mode. What is that?

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
Well, hopefully we explained it a little bit for you.

09:32.000 --> 09:40.000
But it was supposed to be one of the features that put the Xbox One, you know, it was supposed to make it more attractive compared to its competition.

09:40.000 --> 09:47.000
Skype is another one. I want to say that YYR called this show using Skype on his Xbox One.

09:47.000 --> 09:51.000
He was probably using the Snap feature to do it. I don't want to put words in his mouth.

09:51.000 --> 09:56.000
But I'm pretty sure that is something you can do is you can Skype on Xbox One's Snap as well.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
Which is a pretty good way to be able to video chat and all this stuff.

10:00.000 --> 10:05.000
Which, you know, you can't even really do on the Wii U even though it has this whole second screen.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
Well, it's okay though.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Yes, you can video chat but not while playing a game.

10:08.000 --> 10:13.000
It's okay. You can't really video chat on the Xbox One anyways because they don't sell the Kinect cameras with it anymore.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
That's true.

10:14.000 --> 10:21.000
And so, you know, what's the point because your phone, which is probably not a Windows 10 phone, has, you know, Skype built into it as well.

10:22.000 --> 10:31.000
Yeah, it's just, I think it's just a feature they're not using that often and they can get rid of it and boost performance probably somewhere else.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
It'd be more beneficial.

10:32.000 --> 10:38.000
TigerKalonChat says, but a console removing advertised features is no surprise. We've seen this done before.

10:38.000 --> 10:43.000
I wonder if that's a little dig at the other OS thing going on in PlayStation.

10:43.000 --> 10:49.000
This isn't the same thing at all. Other OS was like a completely new set of, you know, you could basically run a whole other OS.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
This is snapping an app to the corner of the screen.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
Yeah, it's more of a design.

10:52.000 --> 10:57.000
Okay, damn. I guess I can't do that at the same plate. I don't think anyone really gives a shit about that.

10:57.000 --> 11:08.000
I still can kind of see the perspective of this is not the OS that you advertised but, okay, it's a little different but I still can see why maybe some people would be sandy about it.

11:08.000 --> 11:18.000
But I want to talk about Xbox's operating system on the One to begin with because I've got to be honest, and I am an Xbox One owner and I do like the Xbox One.

11:18.000 --> 11:23.000
Y'all know I love Forza and, you know, Halo and things that you can only do on Xbox.

11:23.000 --> 11:27.000
I kind of think the Twitch app runs better on Xbox but anyway, I digress.

11:27.000 --> 11:34.000
I do think though the OS and the layout and all that stuff is a fucking mess.

11:34.000 --> 11:39.000
It's just a mess. It is really hard to navigate with a controller.

11:39.000 --> 11:44.000
I understand they built it for Kinect but how long has Kinect been gone now?

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
Excuse me, I guess it's still around for the loyalists.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
No, it's not.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
Microsoft has not been pushing the Kinect for quite some time.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
They're pushing the Kinect like Sony's pushing the Vita.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
Touché.

11:56.000 --> 12:01.000
So I feel like the Xbox, to begin with, is a mess.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
Especially compared to PlayStation 4.

12:04.000 --> 12:09.000
Fuck, Wii U is a pretty clean interface all things considered because there's not much there.

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
But it still is pretty clean compared to the Xbox One.

12:13.000 --> 12:20.000
And it's not that Microsoft doesn't know how to do good, you know, firmware for their operating system.

12:20.000 --> 12:28.000
I think the original Xbox 360 was something a lot of gamers really liked and kind of missed to be honest.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
The blades?

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
The blades, yeah. I think the blades was great.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
Especially compared to what we have now.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
Honestly, it's really hard to find some things.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
Well how are we going to get those advertisers in there if we're...

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
Fuck the advertisers.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
Gotta have those Yaris ads or whatever.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
Do not buy a fucking advertising box for my TV.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
Fuck the advertisements.

12:47.000 --> 12:51.000
What are you going to do about it? We can just change our fucking firmware whenever we want.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
And those ads are going to be there. What are you going to fucking do about it?

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
You're going to throw your system away?

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Sony has advertisements, to be fair.

12:57.000 --> 13:02.000
But I don't find them as annoying because they're kind of, you know, they're kind of in the place...

13:02.000 --> 13:08.000
Like they're in the store where you would, you know, like this game is advertised on sale now.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
You know, when you're looking around a store.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
It kind of makes a little more sense.

13:12.000 --> 13:16.000
Whereas like I feel like on Xbox One it's just like, it's just bleh. Vomited.

13:16.000 --> 13:21.000
Yeah, don't get me wrong. I mean I can understand, you know, cross-promoting stuff in the store that they're actually selling stuff.

13:21.000 --> 13:27.000
But I'm talking about like on Xbox where it's like, you know, watch this on, you know, NBC or something like that.

13:27.000 --> 13:32.000
Or hey, buy a car, you know. That is totally different.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
Okay, some other comments in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

13:35.000 --> 13:39.000
Brad from Pod Culture says, the Kinect is an excellent Skype device.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
We used it for episode 500 to get Christina in on the show.

13:42.000 --> 13:46.000
So yeah, I mean, hell, this show relies on Skype as well, which is not through our Xbox.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
But we love getting calls from Xboxes.

13:48.000 --> 13:54.000
Let's see, sj100matt says, yeah, I don't really like the operating system either and I like my Xbox One a lot.

13:54.000 --> 13:59.000
And Raginator in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, blades with red rings.

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
Okay, the red rings was not what I was talking about.

14:03.000 --> 14:07.000
It was a completely separate issue, which yes, Microsoft deserves crap for.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
But that was, you know, years ago. I think we're all past it.

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
So, but the operating system itself worked fine.

14:13.000 --> 14:19.000
So anyway, I'll be very curious to see what Microsoft plans to redirect those additional resources for.

14:19.000 --> 14:26.000
I mean, if they're getting rid of snap mode, they must be trying to shave off some always stored memory that uses that snap thing.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
So I'll be kind of curious what they're going to use.

14:28.000 --> 14:32.000
They're going to have a lot more processing power for all those Silverlight ads that they'll add.

14:32.000 --> 14:42.000
All right, anyway, let's get into some other gaming news after we take care of some other business here at the top of the show,

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
including how was your gaming week?

14:44.000 --> 14:48.000
What types of video games have you been playing this week? Dark Sakura?

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
I've been playing Smite the Patriarchy.

14:50.000 --> 14:57.000
And I'm kidding. I've been playing...

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
One of my longest, oldest friends, Neil, just walked into the studio.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
He's here to pick up some wine that I got on my trip yesterday.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
So yes, anyway, but he's showing... Is that Amiibo? Is that a Pucci Amiibo?

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
Oh yes, there's a Pucci Amiibo. Oh, he just threw it over here at me.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
See, this is why we need to be on video.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
That is an Ami... Oh yeah, there it is. Look, on its butt.

15:13.000 --> 15:18.000
Amiibo, you touch its butt to the screen and that's how you can unlock Pucci.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
That's from the new 3DS game, right? Okay, yeah.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
Touch its butt.

15:21.000 --> 15:26.000
That's what I thought. I touched its butt and now I will give it back to my friend, Neil, who I've known since I was 12 years old.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
There you go. Anyway.

15:28.000 --> 15:32.000
So we've been playing Legend of Zelda A Link to the Past, actually.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
Old school.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
We're on the Dark World now and it's been pretty fun.

15:36.000 --> 15:44.000
But I'm like the one who knows where all the stuff is in the game and kind of navigating hubby through it.

15:44.000 --> 15:48.000
So it's been pretty fun and I'm actually still playing World of Warcraft.

15:48.000 --> 15:53.000
I'm super loving Legion. I wish more of my friends would be on to play with me.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
Not that she's going to guilt trip him or anything.

15:56.000 --> 16:01.000
Well, but I've really been having a good time playing and I've actually made new friends.

16:01.000 --> 16:08.000
And I spent like 10 minutes earlier today berating somebody for berating our healer.

16:08.000 --> 16:13.000
Because if you're going to be a shit to somebody who's actually doing a good job, expect to be giving shit back.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
You know, I'm just saying. Be nice.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
Shitlords in my MMO?

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
It's more common than you think.

16:20.000 --> 16:25.000
But apart from that, I haven't really been doing a whole bunch.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
And this is the reason I was out last week.

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
I actually have a chronic sinus infection.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
Chronic?

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
Chronic.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
Not like Snoop Dogg chronic.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
No.

16:37.000 --> 16:41.000
The difference between it is that there's something that's causing the infection to stay up there.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
So I'm on six weeks of antibiotics.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
Fun.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Also means not a lot of game time.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Because I get headaches really easily now.

16:49.000 --> 16:53.000
So that's been my week. Very minimalist.

16:53.000 --> 16:58.000
Brad from Pod Culture is offering to play World of Warcraft with you in our chat room.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
Blade's Edge.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
Pay for my sub and I might.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
You know what?

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
What?

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
You can earn all of it in game.

17:06.000 --> 17:10.000
That's true. If you've never played WoW before, you can get the free-

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
It's like 58,000 gold right now though.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
Is it really? That sounds expensive.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
But can't you get like a free to start thing?

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
It's like a level 20 for free.

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
Oh yeah. It's only level 20 for free. You can't even send gold around or anything.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
But it's free to start. I know that.

17:23.000 --> 17:28.000
And I thought when you get the base game, which is probably what? Like 10 bucks now?

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
If that.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
If that.

17:30.000 --> 17:35.000
Maybe we'll have to bring back the VoG giveaways in the future. We'll give away a game card.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
Play WoW with Jamie drawing.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
Yeah.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
I like it.

17:39.000 --> 17:43.000
Well, I've actually got a couple of low levels that I can play with people.

17:44.000 --> 17:48.000
Because Gary is supposed to be playing if he ever gets around to it.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
There you go.

17:49.000 --> 17:54.000
But other than that. Oh yeah. And also, I'm going to finish up watching Goblin this week.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
Oh my god. I'm getting into K-dramas.

17:57.000 --> 18:03.000
Oh gods. Was it you or somebody was telling me about this where, yeah, something like-

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
Goblin is amazing.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
Like the goblin is roommates with death or something?

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
With the Grim Reaper, right.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
Okay, yes. You were talking about this.

18:10.000 --> 18:15.000
And as it turns out, as everyone get together, they were all everyone, of course, except the Goblin because he's immortal.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
We're all reincarnations of people he knew.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
On the next Young and the Restless.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
It's fucking weird and I love it.

18:22.000 --> 18:26.000
And they have like total moonlighting moments and I'm like, just kiss.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Just kiss already. Anyway.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
All right. Loki, how was your gaming week?

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
I'm just basically Skyrim remastered.

18:35.000 --> 18:41.000
So I restarted my game because I was playing through like a heavily modded game and it was fun for a while.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
But then I wanted more of a challenge so I restarted without mods.

18:44.000 --> 18:48.000
Still going to cheat within the game itself.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
You know, any exploit that you can do without mods is what I'm going to do.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
Do you play on your laptop or do you play on like PlayStation?

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
On PlayStation 4.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
Oh, okay. So how is the selection of mods there?

18:57.000 --> 19:01.000
It's all right. I mean, you can't do any of like the graphical mods and stuff like that.

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
But I mean, it's fun to mess around with.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
I still haven't gone and played Fallout 4 yet.

19:06.000 --> 19:13.000
So no Gran Titica or whatever that mod is called that makes all the women topless, even Grandma?

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
No.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
That doesn't exist on PlayStation 4?

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
No, it does not.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
That's too bad.

19:17.000 --> 19:21.000
Probably not an Xbox One either because I'm imagining that that's probably highly moderated.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
Even if it was there, I probably couldn't find it.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
That's what PC is for.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
I see.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
Long live PC. Yeah.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
So I've been playing a lot of that.

19:29.000 --> 19:35.000
Actually, it's funny. I get a lot of use out of my PlayStation VR, but just as that second screen.

19:35.000 --> 19:40.000
You know, because my wife will be watching TV and so I'll play the PlayStation VR and play like Skyrim in it.

19:40.000 --> 19:47.000
And it's kind of fun. I wish Skyrim had like a VR mode to it because, you know, even watching it with just that static screen,

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
there's a lot of times it feels very immersive because of that.

19:50.000 --> 19:55.000
I do really wish that they would fix that stupid screen drifting problem.

19:55.000 --> 20:02.000
It's just, it's really bad having to recenter that thing all the time because it slowly drifts to the left.

20:02.000 --> 20:10.000
I wish it's something they would address quite quickly being that this has been a problem for almost six months now.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
I don't know.

20:13.000 --> 20:17.000
Other than that, I mean, that's pretty much what my gaming week has been.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
I haven't really been playing too much Ingress.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
Haven't played any Pokemon Go.

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
I'm trying to think if I've played any PlayStation VR games.

20:25.000 --> 20:33.000
I almost bought some stuff on there, but I may try a little bit of Planet 3 since that's going to be something that's coming out for the next PlayStation Plus.

20:33.000 --> 20:40.000
But yeah, it's just Skyrim because it's very immersive and there's like, here's the best part.

20:40.000 --> 20:45.000
Like I've been playing Skyrim since it first came out and there's still quests I haven't done yet.

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
Like there's quests like I just get to them like, shit, I haven't done this one yet.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
It's like, my God, the amount of content in there.

20:51.000 --> 20:56.000
The only person I know that's done literally every quest in Skyrim is Alan.

20:56.000 --> 21:03.000
And yes, I realize when I say that, I do know there's ones that like, I don't know if they reset daily or they come back.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
They just, they keep going.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
Okay, so obviously he still gets those, but that's it.

21:07.000 --> 21:12.000
He's done like every other quest besides, I think he never got into the second expansion or something.

21:12.000 --> 21:15.000
But like in the base game, he did them all.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
I was like, wow, you're hot.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Yeah, I mean, it's just, it's fun.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
It's still fun just to mess around with that.

21:24.000 --> 21:31.000
And even after this time, which I can see that might be the draw of why, you know, when it's coming to the Switch that might be still worth it.

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
But for a $60 game though, I don't know.

21:34.000 --> 21:38.000
But the content's definitely, I mean, $60 is the amount of content you're getting in that.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
I mean, it's hundreds of hours of stuff.

21:41.000 --> 21:46.000
Let's see, over in our chat over at live.vognetware.com, we have a chatter named SuperbOwl.

21:46.000 --> 21:50.000
I don't know if that's one of our regulars who renamed or if it's a new person, but SuperbOwl.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
And I think this is a question for you, Logie.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
Does your family ever fuck with you when you've got the headset on?

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
Not really.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
No? They know better?

21:58.000 --> 22:01.000
My son usually say, what are you doing? What are you doing?

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
Because he doesn't know what it is.

22:04.000 --> 22:10.000
And then my other son will be like, I really wish I could play Job Simulator right now.

22:10.000 --> 22:13.000
Daddy, can I play with the headset? Can I do Job Simulator?

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
I'm like, no, I'm playing my game.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
How about you get a real job, kiddo?

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
He likes playing with Job Simulator. That's the thing.

22:18.000 --> 22:22.000
I mean, he'll mess around with, like, I watched him play.

22:22.000 --> 22:27.000
He's played through most of Job Simulator. I haven't really played through much of it, but he enjoys that quite a bit.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
So I'm looking for more games like that.

22:30.000 --> 22:35.000
I hope VR mode for Minecraft comes out on that at some point, because I know they have it on mobile.

22:35.000 --> 22:40.000
Mobile's pretty fun, but it would be nice to have that more widespread.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
I just want more content, more, more, more.

22:42.000 --> 22:48.000
Like Resident Evil 7, holy shit, that's not my type of game, but my god, does that look fucking amazing on VR.

22:48.000 --> 22:52.000
So let's talk about my gaming week a little bit, because I'm going to piggyback on that.

22:52.000 --> 22:56.000
So I didn't really play Resident Evil 7 because I don't do well with the scary games,

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
especially the gory ones.

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
I didn't buy the full game, but I finally got around to playing that last demo,

23:01.000 --> 23:04.000
or I should say, watching Alan play that last demo.

23:04.000 --> 23:08.000
That was something that was happening when there wasn't a show last week,

23:08.000 --> 23:12.000
is that we were sitting around and Alan was actually playing the kitchen demo.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
And so I got to see a lot of that.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
And I got to say, you know, it does look really good.

23:16.000 --> 23:20.000
It doesn't look like Resident Evil to me, which isn't necessarily a bad thing at all.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
I mean, I'm all for new directions for franchises.

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
But yeah, you definitely can kind of see some of the PT influence in it.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
But I don't think it's fair to just say it ripped off PT.

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
You know, it's kind of doing its own thing.

23:31.000 --> 23:35.000
More power to them if they saw there was a market being underserved.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
Sure.

23:36.000 --> 23:39.000
More power to them to take it over, and it worked out well for them.

23:39.000 --> 23:46.000
But yeah, so I was watching that, and then I did watch Shane stream it for a little bit,

23:46.000 --> 23:49.000
because he was doing a VR stream where he was like screaming and all that stuff.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
You know, in his own way.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
And it was just really violent.

23:54.000 --> 23:58.000
And it got to a really, really violent part where I was like, I don't need this.

23:58.000 --> 24:01.000
So I turned it off. I didn't really watch it.

24:01.000 --> 24:04.000
Plus, if Shane's out there, I want everybody to know,

24:04.000 --> 24:08.000
Shane lied, because he said he was going to stream in VR, and he did,

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
until he got too scared, then he turned off the VR.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
And I was like, this is false advertising, and I left.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
Anyway, all right, all in good fun.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
So let me think.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
Other games that I played this week.

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
So while I was sick, I was playing some PlayStation 4.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
I was home from work for like two days.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
I missed two days of work because of it.

24:27.000 --> 24:31.000
I ended up playing randomly a ton of Axiom Verge.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
You remember this game that came out a couple years ago?

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
It's basically a Super Metroid.

24:35.000 --> 24:38.000
I don't want to say it's a clone, because it does its own thing.

24:38.000 --> 24:42.000
You have these different power-ups that you can teleport through walls,

24:42.000 --> 24:46.000
or you can hack enemies that change the way they function.

24:46.000 --> 24:49.000
You might have an enemy that shoots a laser beam that harms you,

24:49.000 --> 24:52.000
but if you hack it, it will do a laser beam that helps you

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
cut through walls and other enemies and stuff.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
So kind of like some different ideas,

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
but otherwise it plays a lot like a Super Metroid game.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
If you guys haven't played it, check it out,

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
especially if you like Super Metroid.

25:02.000 --> 25:05.000
It's a lot of fun, but the difficulty level's a little higher,

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
so I'm even having some problems getting through some parts.

25:08.000 --> 25:12.000
It's just like, wow, you kind of get beat up over and over again.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
But otherwise, I am having fun with that game.

25:15.000 --> 25:19.000
I had a friend over the other night who's a really big fan of Super Smash Bros.,

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
so I was playing Super Smash Bros. on Wii U,

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
probably more than I have in quite some time,

25:23.000 --> 25:28.000
and I didn't even realize I still hadn't unlocked Duck Hunt all this time later.

25:28.000 --> 25:32.000
I had not played enough to unlock that all this time,

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
so we finally got that unlocked, so that's cool.

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
Funny enough that you mentioned that work-related.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
I can't really say what I'm working on,

25:39.000 --> 25:43.000
but I'm going to be working not in my normal office position

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
for the next six weeks,

25:45.000 --> 25:48.000
and part of that is part of this immersion thing that they're doing.

25:48.000 --> 25:52.000
They're going to have a Smash Bros. Melee tournament on the second day there,

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
so I get to play that.

25:53.000 --> 25:57.000
I haven't played Melee, so that'll be interesting.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
Yeah, Melee, you've got to go back a little bit to practice on Melee.

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
I've never played Melee. I've never owned it.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Oh, well, good luck.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
I've been playing against people that haven't played video games before,

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
so it's not going to be that hard.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
Maybe you can do all right.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
So there was that,

26:13.000 --> 26:17.000
and then I've been playing some of the old standbys that I play a lot of,

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
still playing Final Fantasy XIV.

26:19.000 --> 26:22.000
Overwatch, I've been playing a lot more Overwatch this week.

26:22.000 --> 26:27.000
I got mad at Overwatch last week, so we didn't do a show last week,

26:27.000 --> 26:30.000
so I didn't get to tell you guys about how I got mad at Overwatch,

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
but I got really frustrated with the matchmaking in that game,

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
specifically for Capture the Flag.

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
There's only so many losses I can take before I'm just like,

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
fuck everything, I hate this, blah, blah, blah,

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
and I kind of hit that point during the week we had off,

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
and so I haven't touched Capture the Flag ever since.

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
But what I am finding that I really enjoy in Overwatch right now

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
is the Mystery Heroes mode,

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
and that's pretty much where I'm getting all my loot boxes right now,

26:52.000 --> 26:56.000
and I kind of think Blizzard is going to have to balance this a little bit.

26:56.000 --> 26:59.000
If you do the Arcade mode,

26:59.000 --> 27:03.000
you're actually encouraged to win more loot boxes that way

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
than you would in playing Quick Play,

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
because if you win nine matches in a week, you get three loot boxes,

27:08.000 --> 27:11.000
so it's like in the Arcade, but Quick Play you don't get anything.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
What's Arcade mode like?

27:13.000 --> 27:16.000
All Arcade mode is it changes the rules of the original game,

27:16.000 --> 27:20.000
that's all it is, so it's like you can do one mode which is no limits,

27:20.000 --> 27:25.000
where you can have each person on your team be the same hero if you want,

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
you're not locked to one.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
You get the map breaking?

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
Yeah.

27:28.000 --> 27:31.000
Arcade also has the one versus one, which is cool.

27:31.000 --> 27:35.000
The capture the flag, but that'll be gone by the time this event's gone.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
I just need someone to show me the ropes.

27:37.000 --> 27:45.000
Get Alan, because Alan has a level of 270 right now in that game,

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
it's pretty crazy.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
But here's the one I like,

27:48.000 --> 27:52.000
and I think this kind of helps stabilize the skill levels a little bit,

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
is Mystery Heroes is an Arcade,

27:54.000 --> 27:58.000
and in that one, obviously you get a random hero assigned to you,

27:58.000 --> 28:02.000
but every time you die, you get a new hero in the spawn room.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
Interesting.

28:03.000 --> 28:08.000
So you are kind of forced to learn all 22 heroes, basically.

28:08.000 --> 28:11.000
So it's kind of one of those you can kind of,

28:11.000 --> 28:14.000
you're kind of competent with everybody,

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
but you're not necessarily really good with anybody.

28:16.000 --> 28:19.000
Well, unless you play some Quick Play and, you know.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
I was just going to play Mei all the time.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
Yeah, play with Mei? Mei's pretty cool.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Mei can be really annoying,

28:24.000 --> 28:27.000
but you have to kind of learn how to get on the other side of people

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
so you can surprise them,

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
because Mei is all about surprise,

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
so you can freeze them and then shoot an icicle to their head

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
and one-shot them, basically.

28:34.000 --> 28:39.000
So Mei can be really infuriatingly hard on the other team.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
I think that is a challenge.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
If they have a good player.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
So, let's see.

28:43.000 --> 28:46.000
And Brad from Pod Culture in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
Farah rules.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
Yeah, I agree. I love Farah.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
SSG100Matt in chat says,

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
Yeah, the capture the flag match is bad.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
Matchmaking is bad.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
I'm also getting knocked out of game because there are not enough players.

28:56.000 --> 28:59.000
Yeah, I don't like the capture the flag thing at all.

28:59.000 --> 29:03.000
But I kissed and made up with Overwatch,

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
and I've been playing more of it this week.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
And I even did some streaming.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
Cheap plug for my channel.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Rob Roberts over on Twitch.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Check that out.

29:12.000 --> 29:16.000
Also, I want to read this comment about Axiom Verge from Stoppy

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com,

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
who says,

29:19.000 --> 29:20.000
It's a nice game.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
It got too samey for me,

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
but the boss fights were really dope.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
Pixel art was beautiful.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
All made by one guy, basically.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
Yeah, I mean, that's also impressive.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
Like, one guy did the whole thing.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
I think he did the music, too,

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
and he did everything,

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
and that's pretty darn impressive.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
So, go you.

29:38.000 --> 29:41.000
Yeah, some of the boss fights are really epic.

29:41.000 --> 29:44.000
Like, some of them will suddenly zoom out the room,

29:44.000 --> 29:47.000
so the room is suddenly four times the size.

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
Which is kind of, I guess, what they did with Kraid in Super Metroid, right?

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
Remember how that was epic?

29:51.000 --> 29:54.000
Where this, like, Kraid grew so big,

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
it was, like, twice the size of the screen.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
Remember that?

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
Well, remember if that, or think if that happened,

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
but it all, like, the screen zoomed out,

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
so you could see it all happening at once.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
That's what Axiom Verge does in some parts,

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
which is pretty cool.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
Yeah, it's pretty cool. I like that.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
Okay, I think that's it for my gaming week.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
That's enough.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
So, we'll get into housekeeping,

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
of which I don't have a lot to say.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
We don't have a whole lot of events coming up,

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
except for, I will mention,

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
Orange Lawns Radio and VOG Network

30:20.000 --> 30:23.000
will be a part of the Sacramento Indie Arcade

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
again this year.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
And if you've been listening to the show

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
for a little while now,

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
you know that we've done this event here locally

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
for the past couple years.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
So, this will be our third year participating.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
So, Sac Indie Arcade is going to happen

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
at the West Sacramento Convention Center.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
So, this is probably for you locals,

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
but I would say it's worth a drive up from the Bay Area.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
If you happen to live over there,

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
you should check that out.

30:43.000 --> 30:46.000
It's going to be on Saturday, April the 8th,

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
at the West Sacramento Community Center.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
More information at Indiearcade.org.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
We will be there.

30:52.000 --> 30:55.000
I'm almost positive our pals from Video Game Bang,

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
you know, another show here in the area

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
who we've had on our show before,

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
I'm positive they'll be there in some capacity.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
And who knows who else?

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
Who knows who else we'll meet this year

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
that we'll end up dragging onto our own program

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
in the coming weeks.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
So, check that out in April

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
over in West Sacramento.

31:10.000 --> 31:14.000
Alright, let's get into some other gaming news.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
We'll start off with Loki.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
What happened this week in gaming?

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
Not a whole lot.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
No, just kidding.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
Lots of stuff, actually.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
So, the big thing, though,

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
we've been talking about this for a while now,

31:24.000 --> 31:28.000
the whole ZeniMax versus Oculus lawsuit thing

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
that was going on.

31:29.000 --> 31:32.000
Well, they finally have finished the lawsuit.

31:32.000 --> 31:35.000
So, ZeniMax ended up winning a portion

31:35.000 --> 31:38.000
of the damages that they sought.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
So, originally they were hoping to get

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
the whole $2 billion,

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
but they got a quarter of that,

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
so $500 million,

31:45.000 --> 31:48.000
which is definitely not a small number.

31:48.000 --> 31:51.000
Yeah, that's still a lot of money.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
That's a lot of money.

31:52.000 --> 31:56.000
So, basically, the reason they came up with that amount,

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
not the $2 billion,

31:57.000 --> 32:00.000
is because they found that Palmer Lucky

32:00.000 --> 32:04.000
did fail to comply with a nondisclosure agreement,

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
but at the same time,

32:05.000 --> 32:08.000
they didn't find that Oculus misappropriated

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
any trade secrets.

32:10.000 --> 32:13.000
So, they got them on that one count,

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
but not anything else.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
So, I'm kind of glad that this is all over.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
Yeah, but no, it ain't over.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
Appeal, appeal, appeal, appeal.

32:22.000 --> 32:23.000
It's not over yet.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
True.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
But it's interesting that it didn't go to settlement,

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
because usually these legal things

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
that come up on OLR all the time,

32:30.000 --> 32:33.000
which I admit, none of us are lawyers,

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
so we can only kind of look at it

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
from a gamer perspective,

32:37.000 --> 32:41.000
but usually these things get settled

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
that we bring up on the show.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
So, to hear like $500 million,

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
that's a lot of money,

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
and you have to wonder like,

32:46.000 --> 32:50.000
how might that impact Oculus' future?

32:50.000 --> 32:53.000
You know, especially when the VR game

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
is getting more and more crowded, it seems, right?

32:55.000 --> 33:00.000
Between HTC Vive and PlayStation VR

33:00.000 --> 33:03.000
and cheaper alternatives like Gear VR

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
and so on and so on.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
Like, how might this affect Oculus

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
at the end of the day, if at all?

33:07.000 --> 33:10.000
I mean, maybe they can just,

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
maybe Facebook can lose $500 million easy,

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
but I don't know.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
It would seem like that's a big chunk

33:15.000 --> 33:16.000
of change to lose.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
That, yeah, I mean,

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
a quarter of your funding,

33:20.000 --> 33:21.000
that's quite a bit.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
Yeah.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
Stoppy with his perspective in chat

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
over at live.vognetwork.com says,

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
really strange result for the case.

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
I didn't think they had a case,

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
but I guess they did on the non-disclosure stuff.

33:31.000 --> 33:34.000
I hear they also want to halt Rift sales.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.000
Yeah, I'd heard about that too.

33:35.000 --> 33:38.000
Maybe something where they get,

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
they have to get the payment again

33:40.000 --> 33:41.000
or something before that can start again,

33:41.000 --> 33:42.000
but again, that's all gonna get tied up

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
in appeals anyway.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
That probably will not happen.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
Dungeonbuster in chat says,

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
high price to pay for breaking an NDA.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
Ooh, ain't that the truth?

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
Dungeonbuster continues,

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
Carmack was not impressed by the software

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
analyst ZeniMax brought to court.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
Yeah, he posted a whole little thing

33:58.000 --> 34:01.000
on social media, I think,

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
that was picked up by some blog somewhere

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
and obviously not happy about it.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
So, hmm.

34:07.000 --> 34:10.000
All right, well, the legal things

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
will continue, I'm sure.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
To register participation for this week's

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000
episode of Orange Lounge Radio at

34:17.000 --> 34:20.000
vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, palm.

34:20.000 --> 34:23.000
Meanwhile, let's talk about the Nintendo 3DS.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
Obviously, we've talked a lot about the Switch

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
in the past few weeks.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
Which I'd like to update.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.000
Yes?

34:28.000 --> 34:29.000
I have canceled my fucking pre-order.

34:29.000 --> 34:30.000
You did?

34:30.000 --> 34:31.000
Yes.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
Oh, so to follow up from a couple weeks ago,

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
you were kind of threatening to do it,

34:35.000 --> 34:36.000
and now you've gone through with it.

34:36.000 --> 34:37.000
I just, the way I looked at it,

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
I mean, I was looking at what titles

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
are coming out in the timeframe that they're coming out.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
It just did not make any sense to purchase

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
a system for one game that I can play

34:45.000 --> 34:46.000
on a system I already have.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.000
Yeah.

34:47.000 --> 34:50.000
And the advantages, like, the graphic

34:50.000 --> 34:53.000
advantages, I guess, between the Switch

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
and the Wii U weren't that great.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
It's like a slightly increased draw distance

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
and the resolution's a hair higher.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
Yeah.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
And that's it.

35:01.000 --> 35:04.000
And it's like, why would I drop $400 for that?

35:04.000 --> 35:07.000
You know, and I gotta admit, and I think

35:07.000 --> 35:08.000
we talked about this a couple weeks ago,

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
and I don't want to double-talk ourselves

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
too much, but, you know, I gotta admit,

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
even I'm getting to a point where I'm like,

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
do I really need to get one right now?

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Because I feel like, I really feel like

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
Holiday is the true launch of the Switch.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.000
Yeah, exactly.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
I think when there's more titles out,

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
it's gonna be worth it, maybe,

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
but I'm still worried, like,

35:27.000 --> 35:31.000
there's news about EA, we didn't have it

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
in the show, but talking about how they're

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
moving their other franchises, the Frostbite,

35:35.000 --> 35:39.000
like, you know, Madden, and I want to say FIFA,

35:39.000 --> 35:42.000
if that's the case, I mean, the FIFA that

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
they have on there now is based on a really

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
old version of FIFA, because they can't run

35:46.000 --> 35:49.000
these modern engines, and as these other

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
systems get higher and higher spec,

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
that's less that they can port over.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
I mean, I don't know, it's...

35:55.000 --> 35:58.000
Yeah, I mean, and that third-party support,

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
I mean, we saw what happened with Wii U,

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
if the technology can't handle it, but...

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
Well, and I'd said this before, and this

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
kind of leads into this story a little bit,

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
is that, you know, when I think the Switch

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
more as a handheld system, I'm way more

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
comfortable with it than when I start to

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
think about it as a console system.

36:14.000 --> 36:17.000
I mean, I just, I always wanted the 3DS to

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
be able to hook up to the TV, I think that

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
would be awesome, you have to pay, like,

36:21.000 --> 36:24.000
a $300 cable to get hard-wired in your DS

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
to be able to stream things legally,

36:26.000 --> 36:27.000
like Pokemon, right?

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
If those streamers you see on Twitch are

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
doing it legally, you know, they had to mod

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
their 3DS to do it, which is not cheap.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
So, you know, I always wanted to be able to

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
do, like, DS on the TV, so I think this is

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
cool when I look at it from the perspective

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
of a portable, but even I'm, like,

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
I'm really trying to cut Nintendo a break

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
here, you guys, and I probably still will

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
end up buying the system, because I'm a

36:47.000 --> 36:50.000
consumer whore, and how, but I'm getting

36:50.000 --> 36:53.000
really frustrated that Nintendo is staying

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
quiet on as much as they are. Like, this

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
whole fact that the Virtual Console thing,

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
that they are still not disclosing the

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
details on it, I mean, honestly, what it

37:01.000 --> 37:02.000
says to me, it's not there. Virtual Console's

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
not going to be there when the system

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
launches. That's what the quiet is telling

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
me, is that all these things we think are

37:07.000 --> 37:10.000
coming because of the Super Nintendo over

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
the internet, which they teased on their

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
website in the one game a month and all this,

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
it's not going to be there in March. That's

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
what this silence is telling me, which is

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
why I'm saying I really think it's all

37:20.000 --> 37:23.000
going to be built in later on in the holiday.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
Just like, so, what did they say? It's going

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
to run USB 2.0 at first, but a firmware

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
thing is going to bring it up to 3.0, and

37:29.000 --> 37:30.000
all this stuff, right?

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
That's not how USB ports work.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
Isn't that weird?

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
That's not how it works.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.000
It's weird.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
It either is or it isn't. You can't just

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
patch that in. That's not how that fucking

37:39.000 --> 37:43.000
works. And that's the thing, it's like, a

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
lot of this stuff, and they're not the

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
only ones at fault with this type of stuff,

37:47.000 --> 37:50.000
but like, you can't promise all these

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
features and not have them there at launch.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
It's stupid. Oh yeah, we'll patch it in

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
later. Why? Why am I going to buy this

37:56.000 --> 37:59.000
right now? It's not fucking ready yet. And

37:59.000 --> 38:02.000
I don't know, but basically the other day

38:02.000 --> 38:05.000
it came down to, what games do I want?

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
To be fair, Loki, if they can sell

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
millions of them this holiday, all this

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
blue in the face talk won't even matter.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
I mean, it's going to be the 3DS all over

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
again, right? 3DS was weak when it first

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
launched, ended up one of the strongest

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
systems ever. I bet a lot of people that

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
have the Wii U and the 3DS will probably

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
pick the system up. Will it attract new

38:23.000 --> 38:26.000
people like we did? Probably not.

38:26.000 --> 38:29.000
But Nintendo, to be fair again, Nintendo

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
did something they never do today. They

38:31.000 --> 38:34.000
advertised during that concert that

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
everybody's watching that has a football

38:36.000 --> 38:39.000
game around it. So, you know. Showing off

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
games that aren't going to be out in four

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
or six months, that's pretty nice. Alright,

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
well look, let me, I don't want to rehash

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
two weeks ago's episode too much, but

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
there's a reason why I bring this up, and

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
that is an important update, Loki. But

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
this whole fact that I'm talking about

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
when I see the Switch as a handheld

38:55.000 --> 38:58.000
system, I am a bigger fan. But yet

38:58.000 --> 39:01.000
Nintendo keeps insisting that the 3DS is

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
not done, and that this is a new home

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
console, which kind of, it actually kind

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
of frustrates me. Like, it actually kind

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
of frustrates me that I'm like, I'm trying

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
to adopt this as my new handheld, but you

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
are trying to like, convince me that 3DS

39:13.000 --> 39:16.000
is still a thing, whereas I'm worried that

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
3DS is just your fallback guy. That if

39:18.000 --> 39:21.000
somehow the Switch shits the bed, at least

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
you still have the 3DS. Like, I'm kind of

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
worried in that regard. But anyway, let

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
me elaborate on that a little bit, because

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
there was an interview this week with

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
Tatsumi Kimishima, who had talked about

39:31.000 --> 39:34.000
in an interview, in a Q&A Japanese

39:34.000 --> 39:37.000
financial results thing. The question was,

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
this is about your thoughts on having

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
both a Nintendo 3DS and Nintendo Switch

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
coexisting together. When a player first

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
uses the Nintendo Switch and recognizes

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
it as a portable device, is there a point

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
to releasing a next generation handheld

39:49.000 --> 39:52.000
console? So, thank you, somebody kind of

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
calling him out on this, and clarifying

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
this, so here's the answer.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
I believe that for the time being, the

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
Nintendo 3DS and Nintendo Switch can

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
coexist together. Compared to the Nintendo

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
3DS, the Nintendo Switch is different in

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
shape, size, and price, and the variety of

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
quantity of games that are currently playable

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
now, and different between the two. With

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
those differences in mind, I believe that

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
a Nintendo 3DS would work well for parents

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
that are looking into getting their children

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
their first games. Therefore, as a portable

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
gaming device, I believe that Nintendo

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
3DS has a different demand and market

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
than the Nintendo Switch, and as we've

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
gone about with portable consoles until

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
now, we will continue considering a

40:28.000 --> 40:33.000
successor. So, Nintendo's viewing the 3DS

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
as the kiddie system, is what that quote

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
says to me. And that's, you know, we kind

40:37.000 --> 40:40.000
of thought this when the 2DS was first

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
announced, that this was them really

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
trying to push it towards younger people

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
by taking the 3D out that, you know, have

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
all the youth warnings, to get more

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
younger people playing Pokemon and all

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
this. So now, at least with that quote,

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
it kind of just sounds to me like, if the

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
3DS is going to continue here for a couple

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
years, with the Switch and co-existing,

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
the 3DS, they are really pushing as a

41:00.000 --> 41:04.000
entry-level kids gaming system. So,

41:04.000 --> 41:07.000
Nintendo's embracing the kiddie games thing.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
When they get that down to a price point

41:09.000 --> 41:10.000
that makes sense like that, I mean, I

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
guess that would be okay.

41:12.000 --> 41:13.000
Yeah.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
That's definitely, I don't even know what

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
the 2DS is now, is that under $100

41:17.000 --> 41:18.000
yet? I mean...

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
Well, like Black Friday, yeah, was like

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
$99. I don't know if that's still a thing,

41:22.000 --> 41:23.000
but...

41:23.000 --> 41:24.000
But, like, you get it down to like $50

41:24.000 --> 41:27.000
or something, then, yeah, that's pretty,

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
pretty smoking.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
Could you do that technology for $50?

41:30.000 --> 41:31.000
I don't know.

41:31.000 --> 41:32.000
Maybe? I don't know. I don't know how

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
cheap the tech is now. So, some folks in

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
chat over at Live.VogueNetwork.com

41:36.000 --> 41:37.000
pointing out, it's Joe and Hunter Matt

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
saying, you can't really find 3DSs in

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
stores anymore. I've been to a ton of

41:41.000 --> 41:42.000
stores over the past few weeks in

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
different states. I haven't seen a new

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
3DS XL anywhere. Yeah, they have

41:46.000 --> 41:49.000
a lot of problems over the holidays,

41:49.000 --> 41:52.000
and wasn't that in large part to Pokemon?

41:52.000 --> 41:56.000
And, in some ways, Pokemon Go, and the

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
strength, to be fair, the strength of

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
Pokemon Sun and Moon as new games in the

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
franchise, they're great, but kind of

42:02.000 --> 42:05.000
those two things combined created a huge

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
demand for Pokemon Sun and Moon and the

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
system to play them on. And, you know,

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
Sun and Moon have been selling, I don't

42:11.000 --> 42:14.000
think they've outsold X and Y yet, but

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
they will, and they've already outsold

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
I'm surprised they don't have a port of

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
that yet for, like, the Switch. Imagine

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
launching with that. Yet. Yeah, yet, but,

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
like, seriously, imagine launching with

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
something like that. I mean, that would,

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
I don't know, at least be a little better.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
Okay, Bob Coffee's jumping in to correct

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
us here. The joy of having live chat.

42:34.000 --> 42:37.000
2DS manufacturer suggested retail price

42:37.000 --> 42:41.000
is $79 now. So, it is still pretty good.

42:41.000 --> 42:44.000
So. I wish it folded it in half, but, you

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
know, it's still pretty good. You have

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
$79, though. You gotta leave some things

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
by the wayside. So. But, you know, again,

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
if you're trying to get your kids to play

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
Pokemon Sun and Moon, this can do it.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
But does Sun and Moon actually work on

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
the older systems, or is it one of those

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
things you have to have the new 3DS for?

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
No, I have an old 3DS. As if that's not

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
fucking confusing enough as it is. It's

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
fine. It runs fine on the old 3DS. The

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
only part that gets a little choppy weird

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
is that camera where they kind of did

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
the Pokemon Snap thing. They put that in

43:12.000 --> 43:15.000
Sun and Moon. But, like, I don't, I think

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
I did the introduction part of that, and

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
then I haven't even bothered to look for

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
other areas where you can do that. Like,

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
it's just, it's not something you have to

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
do in the game. And even if I had to, I

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
could probably fake it well enough. But

43:27.000 --> 43:30.000
it seems to run well enough. And Bob

43:30.000 --> 43:33.000
Coffee points out there is only one new

43:33.000 --> 43:36.000
3DS only game. That's Xenoblade Chronicles.

43:37.000 --> 43:41.000
Nothing so far. Well, didn't they...

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
No, that's not true. Xenoblade Chronicles,

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
yeah, it is, you have to have it for that.

43:45.000 --> 43:48.000
Although, I believe that, um, Hyrule

43:48.000 --> 43:51.000
Warriors ran like shit without it.

43:51.000 --> 43:54.000
And I think it's the Fire Emblem that's

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
going to be the Fire Emblem Warriors that

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
they confirmed for 3DS. I think it's also

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
sporting the new 3DS logo on it.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
I think that's probably going to be only

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
new 3DS, because it ran from what I hear

44:04.000 --> 44:08.000
pretty terribly on the 3DS. Anyway, be

44:08.000 --> 44:11.000
very curious to see how that develops

44:11.000 --> 44:14.000
over the coming years, because I, I don't

44:14.000 --> 44:15.000
know, I kind of think they should just,

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
like, seriously stop focusing on the 3DS.

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
But maybe... They may be doing that soon.

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
I mean, have there been a lot of

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
announcements for the 3DS? Yeah, that

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
Fire Emblem had one. Like, that's one. I

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
mean, what else is on the pipeline? Well,

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
it's still something that made me go,

44:29.000 --> 44:32.000
leave it alone. But alright, you know,

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
okay, fine. You know, yes, there are a

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
ton of 3DSs out there, and you want to

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
put software on a platform where you

44:38.000 --> 44:39.000
know lots of people will be able to buy

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
it. So, like, I get it, it makes sense,

44:41.000 --> 44:45.000
but, you know, I just... Tell me more

44:45.000 --> 44:48.000
about the Switch. Put those resources on,

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
on Virtual Console, and more Switch

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
games, and... Well, Fire Emblem,

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
Masao, or whatever, it doesn't seem like

44:54.000 --> 44:57.000
it's an entry-level game for kids. No.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
It's like, they're saying, oh, this is a

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
kid's system, but then they're putting,

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
like... You can kind of button mash in

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
those games, though. That's a load of

45:05.000 --> 45:08.000
shit, is what it is. It's a load of shit.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
Their excuse saying that it's a kid's

45:10.000 --> 45:14.000
system is, that statement does not match

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
with the kind of product that they have

45:16.000 --> 45:19.000
on those platforms. It's just, this is

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
staying around for a while, because

45:21.000 --> 45:24.000
there's the, you know, the market

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
saturation for it, and just in case this

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
shit doesn't work out with the Switch, I

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
think would be better. But they can't say

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
that, obviously.

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
All right. Well, we'll see if Nintendo

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
will say anything in the coming weeks

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
before, you know, the less...

45:38.000 --> 45:39.000
Or nothing at all.

45:39.000 --> 45:42.000
Before the less-than-a-month ship day

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
for the Nintendo Switch. Can you believe

45:44.000 --> 45:47.000
that? We are less than four weeks away

45:47.000 --> 45:48.000
at this point, right?

45:48.000 --> 45:49.000
Yeah.

45:49.000 --> 45:52.000
Less than four weeks away from the Switch.

45:52.000 --> 45:55.000
It's just, it's all happening so fast.

45:55.000 --> 45:56.000
Then again, at the same time, this has

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
been a drawn-out thing for years and

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
years and years. It also feels like...

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
I'm just glad to be able to play Zelda

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
in a few weeks. That's pretty awesome.

46:04.000 --> 46:05.000
That'll be cool. That'll be cool.

46:05.000 --> 46:06.000
All right, DarkSakura, what do you have

46:06.000 --> 46:09.000
for us in other news this week in gaming?

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
Some Squeamixie stuff.

46:11.000 --> 46:15.000
Basically, Square Enix and Marvel Studios

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
has decided they're gonna play nice

46:17.000 --> 46:21.000
together. Really nice. Everyone's gonna

46:21.000 --> 46:24.000
love it. It's really great. Just saying.

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
Anyway, they are working on something

46:26.000 --> 46:30.000
called the Avengers Project, being developed

46:30.000 --> 46:33.000
by Crystal Dynamics in Eidos, Montreal.

46:33.000 --> 46:36.000
I watched the trailer. Have you guys seen

46:36.000 --> 46:37.000
the trailer for this?

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
Yes. This is kind of a real teaser, though.

46:39.000 --> 46:40.000
Yeah, it is.

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
It doesn't really show any game.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
But it just makes me think, I mean, we've

46:44.000 --> 46:47.000
got some franchise... It's a franchise.

46:47.000 --> 46:51.000
We've got some developers that are pretty

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
top-notch, I think, getting involved on this.

46:53.000 --> 46:56.000
And yes, even high-profile developers

46:56.000 --> 46:57.000
can make steaming piles of shit.

46:57.000 --> 46:58.000
Sure.

46:58.000 --> 47:01.000
But I'm looking forward to this one.

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
I think that whatever comes out of it

47:03.000 --> 47:06.000
would have to be pretty good and really pretty.

47:06.000 --> 47:09.000
Crystal D's record with these past two

47:09.000 --> 47:12.000
Tomb Raider games is pretty A+.

47:12.000 --> 47:13.000
I mean, those two games really kicked

47:13.000 --> 47:16.000
a lot of ass. So, you think about, even

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
if they just somehow slapped the Avengers

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
into that, I think a lot of people would

47:20.000 --> 47:21.000
be on board, right?

47:21.000 --> 47:22.000
Yeah.

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
So, and maybe that's all this is.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
And I think a lot of us are okay with that.

47:26.000 --> 47:27.000
You know what?

47:27.000 --> 47:28.000
I'm sure they're...

47:28.000 --> 47:29.000
Black Widow's a really bad day.

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
No, if they were going to have me design

47:31.000 --> 47:34.000
a game, it would be Jessica Jones with

47:34.000 --> 47:37.000
her rage meter filled by liquor.

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
Let's see.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
I would play that game all day.

47:41.000 --> 47:42.000
Dungeonbuster in chat at

47:42.000 --> 47:43.000
live.voguenetwork.com says,

47:43.000 --> 47:46.000
I hope it's an Avengers ARPG.

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
The X-Men Legends series by Raven were great.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
First Alliance was solid. Second one was meh,

47:50.000 --> 47:51.000
but still fun.

47:51.000 --> 47:54.000
So, and you were a big fan of those

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
Marvel Ultimate Alliance games, weren't you,

47:56.000 --> 47:57.000
Darcy?

47:57.000 --> 47:58.000
Yeah, for a bit.

47:58.000 --> 47:59.000
They were okay. They were pretty fun.

47:59.000 --> 48:00.000
You know what would be badass?

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
Even though I really don't like the combat

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
system at all, to put the Final Fantasy

48:04.000 --> 48:07.000
XV combat system in an Avengers game.

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
I could be here for that.

48:09.000 --> 48:10.000
I haven't played it yet.

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
Although, I mean, even though we talk

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
about it's Square Enix doing a Marvel game,

48:14.000 --> 48:15.000
you know, this...

48:15.000 --> 48:16.000
But they're not developing it.

48:16.000 --> 48:19.000
Well, but this is also kind of the American

48:19.000 --> 48:20.000
acquisitions.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
It's Eidos, basically, what used to be that,

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
is kind of creating this.

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
It's not really coming from the people

48:26.000 --> 48:27.000
that are doing Final Fantasy.

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
Not to say that crossover can't exist.

48:29.000 --> 48:30.000
Yeah, they could re-use the engine.

48:30.000 --> 48:31.000
I mean, yeah.

48:31.000 --> 48:34.000
And to be fair, Crystal Dynamics also

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
made kind of smaller games.

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
Like they made like the Lara Croft Go.

48:38.000 --> 48:39.000
Was them right?

48:39.000 --> 48:40.000
Yeah, I think.

48:40.000 --> 48:43.000
And then the Temple games.

48:43.000 --> 48:44.000
I can't remember the name off the top of my head,

48:44.000 --> 48:47.000
but they had some games on like PlayStation 3

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
that were like specifically for the download store.

48:49.000 --> 48:50.000
They were more like co-op games.

48:50.000 --> 48:53.000
And they were fun, but they were a little more small scale.

48:53.000 --> 48:54.000
And they made me think a little more

48:54.000 --> 48:55.000
of the Marvel's Ultimate Alliance.

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
But that trailer kind of made me think,

48:57.000 --> 49:01.000
nah, this is on the level of like Rise of the Tomb Raider,

49:01.000 --> 49:02.000
where this is going.

49:02.000 --> 49:03.000
Well, we'll see how it...

49:03.000 --> 49:04.000
Well, I hope.

49:04.000 --> 49:05.000
Mobile game.

49:05.000 --> 49:06.000
Ah, shit.

49:06.000 --> 49:07.000
We'll see how it turns out at any rate,

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
because I'll be perfectly honest.

49:09.000 --> 49:12.000
I'm ready for a good Avengers

49:12.000 --> 49:15.000
or any kind of Marvel franchise that isn't.

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
I mean, nothing to say bad about Telltale.

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
You know, the Guardians of the Galaxy thing is interesting.

49:19.000 --> 49:23.000
But in the Lego games, I'm kind of over them.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
I would rather have like a really good

49:25.000 --> 49:30.000
full scale adventure game, you know, as an Avenger.

49:30.000 --> 49:33.000
You know, if they had it like where you had your core team

49:33.000 --> 49:36.000
and it did sort of a Lara Croft-y style, you know,

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
thing for the Avengers through the world,

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
but you had a different series of missions

49:40.000 --> 49:43.000
for each team or each person on the team,

49:43.000 --> 49:44.000
that would be pretty rad.

49:44.000 --> 49:45.000
Yeah.

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
And that, and I also, I mean,

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
this would be kind of a dream of mine,

49:49.000 --> 49:53.000
is if we had like a throwback to like 80s Avengers

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
or late 90s Avengers.

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
Well, my thought is this will probably ultimately

49:57.000 --> 50:00.000
be a movie tie-in because don't we have

50:00.000 --> 50:01.000
another Avengers movie?

50:01.000 --> 50:02.000
Is it this year or next year?

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
Infinity Wars is supposed to be coming out soon.

50:04.000 --> 50:07.000
But Infinity Wars is like an everybody movie.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
But is that this year or next year?

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
Because isn't Guardians of the Galaxy 2 this year?

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
Guardians of the Galaxy 2 is in May,

50:13.000 --> 50:16.000
and I believe there's also going to be Thor Ragnarok this year.

50:16.000 --> 50:17.000
I don't know.

50:17.000 --> 50:20.000
So maybe somebody like Tiger Claw or somebody

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
that really follows these movies better than I do,

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
probably knows these exact release dates.

50:24.000 --> 50:25.000
And I know they're supposed to be,

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
I think they're already talking another Doctor Strange,

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
or at least Doctor Strange tying in with Thor.

50:29.000 --> 50:30.000
Yeah.

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
But there's also some one-off movies

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
people have very much been looking forward to,

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
like Black Panther, the Ms. Marvel movie

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
or whatever they're calling it.

50:38.000 --> 50:42.000
Yeah, I think she will, officially in the comics now,

50:42.000 --> 50:43.000
she's Captain Marvel.

50:43.000 --> 50:47.000
Ms. Marvel is now the Kamala Khan, the stretchy girl.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
Okay. Oh, so it's Captain Marvel, sorry.

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
So it'd be Carol Danvers.

50:51.000 --> 50:52.000
Tiger Claw on chat says,

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
this year is Guardians of the Galaxy, Spider-Man,

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
and Thor Ragnarok.

50:56.000 --> 50:57.000
I forgot about Spider-Man.

50:57.000 --> 51:01.000
I forgot about the yet again Spider-Man redo.

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
Honestly enough, I haven't seen the movie

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
for the cinematic universe,

51:05.000 --> 51:09.000
but I did see Captain America Civil War.

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
And I was like, if that's Spider-Man, I'm behind it.

51:11.000 --> 51:12.000
Cause it was pretty fun.

51:12.000 --> 51:17.000
Yeah, Black Panther, Avengers Infinity War Part 1

51:17.000 --> 51:20.000
and Ant-Man and the Wasp are supposed to be 2018.

51:20.000 --> 51:21.000
I am looking forward to that too.

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
And then 19 would be Captain Marvel

51:23.000 --> 51:26.000
and the second part of the Infinity War.

51:26.000 --> 51:29.000
So this game, I would think, Darkseid,

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
I know you're talking about your dream 80s project

51:31.000 --> 51:32.000
and all this stuff.

51:32.000 --> 51:33.000
I mean, they could do anything,

51:33.000 --> 51:36.000
but I would assume this is gonna be some type of movie tie-in

51:36.000 --> 51:40.000
for Avengers Part 1 or Part 2, Infinity War.

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
So just depending, I mean,

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
cause they didn't show any footage.

51:45.000 --> 51:46.000
Now E3 could change it.

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
This could be a big E3 teaser.

51:48.000 --> 51:49.000
They're gonna come out at E3

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
and show us something big.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
And hopefully within those two years,

51:53.000 --> 51:57.000
they can re-license the X-Men and Deadpool back.

51:58.000 --> 52:01.000
Dear Marvel, bring back one of my favorite ever characters,

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
Monica Rambeau. Thank you.

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
But the whole Deadpool thing is really interesting

52:06.000 --> 52:09.000
because that movie, getting the Globe nomination,

52:09.000 --> 52:12.000
like really made some people kind of go, what?

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
Well, and now they're trying to get-

52:14.000 --> 52:15.000
It didn't get an Oscar though, right?

52:15.000 --> 52:16.000
It didn't get an Oscar nom, right?

52:16.000 --> 52:19.000
Now they're also trying though to get Hugh Jackman in it

52:19.000 --> 52:22.000
to do Wolverine, Deadpool crossover,

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
which always every time-

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
They already did and it was bad.

52:26.000 --> 52:27.000
No, I mean a good one.

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
Not that thing that doesn't exist in my heart.

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
Reminder, that happened and it wasn't good.

52:31.000 --> 52:32.000
That was never a movie, I'm sorry.

52:32.000 --> 52:35.000
I'm not even the big comic fan she is, even I know that.

52:35.000 --> 52:36.000
It doesn't exist in my heart.

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
It does not exist in my universe.

52:38.000 --> 52:42.000
There was a few missteps in several Spider-Man movies that-

52:42.000 --> 52:45.000
You have the Merc with the mouth and take out his mouth.

52:46.000 --> 52:47.000
Stupid.

52:48.000 --> 52:49.000
So stupid.

52:49.000 --> 52:55.000
But no, I could just talk forever though about comics and stuff.

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
You need to bring back a podcast.

52:57.000 --> 53:00.000
You know, I've been talking to Spike about it.

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
Oh, just what that boy needs.

53:02.000 --> 53:03.000
Right?

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
We got Drag Race coming back soon.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
He's gonna have that on his plate.

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
Okay, let's just get it out of the way.

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
I'm Team Trinity, thank you.

53:13.000 --> 53:16.000
I'm a big fan of the way Nina Bonina paints herself.

53:16.000 --> 53:19.000
I think I like some of those looks, I gotta say.

53:19.000 --> 53:20.000
I got my eye on her.

53:20.000 --> 53:24.000
She's got a little sloppiness though with her appendages, I'm just saying.

53:24.000 --> 53:25.000
We're all a little sloppy.

53:25.000 --> 53:30.000
All right, moving on before, as people consistently tune out of the show.

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
Let's move on to another story. Loki.

53:32.000 --> 53:36.000
So this is kind of cool because I got pretty excited when I heard about the news regarding this.

53:36.000 --> 53:41.000
You know, PlayStation Pro for me doesn't really seem like it's much of an upgrade for a lot of different games.

53:41.000 --> 53:45.000
I mean, the support for the Pro mode for a lot of these games is kind of, you know, whatever.

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
And a lot of games didn't have that support.

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
Well, that's gonna change pretty soon.

53:49.000 --> 53:56.000
PlayStation 4's 4.5 update, which is still in the beta phase and only you have to be in the beta program to get access to it.

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
They have a lot of improvements at their end.

53:58.000 --> 54:01.000
So one of these improvements includes Boost Mode.

54:01.000 --> 54:13.000
And what Boost Mode is, is it allows games that don't have this Pro mode or you can run it, you know, separate of Pro mode to run at a higher GPU and CPU clock speed.

54:13.000 --> 54:18.000
And it improves the performance of games released before Pro mode was available.

54:18.000 --> 54:19.000
What does this do?

54:19.000 --> 54:27.000
It makes some of these games that were absolute dog shit as far as performance actually fucking playable and nice.

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
Like Just Cause 3, for example.

54:29.000 --> 54:33.000
I saw another video, which actually you probably like, Final Fantasy XIV.

54:33.000 --> 54:36.000
They showed, you know, the amount of lag that they were getting and everything.

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
Super silky smooth. It was just like...

54:38.000 --> 54:39.000
Oh wow.

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
It was fantastic.

54:41.000 --> 54:44.000
So just a lot of good things been hearing about it.

54:44.000 --> 54:47.000
People trying it out and posting gameplay video and stuff like that.

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
I think it's gonna be a really good thing.

54:49.000 --> 54:54.000
It actually kind of has me excited considering getting a PlayStation Pro just for that because it sounds...

54:55.000 --> 55:00.000
Yeah, this is kind of something I think a lot of us Pro people kind of wish was there in the beginning.

55:00.000 --> 55:01.000
But I'll take it. I'll take it.

55:01.000 --> 55:02.000
Exactly.

55:02.000 --> 55:07.000
The other thing that's gonna be coming with that 4.5 update is external hard drive support.

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
Which, my god, about time.

55:09.000 --> 55:14.000
So you'll be able to connect the USB 3.0 external hard drive up to 8 terabytes of storage space.

55:14.000 --> 55:18.000
And you can use it for PlayStation 4 games and applications and whatever.

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
So that's pretty awesome as well.

55:20.000 --> 55:26.000
Well, they're also gonna be adding 3D Blu-ray support on the PlayStation VR.

55:26.000 --> 55:29.000
Okay, that actually kind of makes me want a PlayStation VR.

55:29.000 --> 55:34.000
Seriously, and look, I realize there aren't a ton of 3D Blu-rays out there.

55:34.000 --> 55:42.000
But there's one that's very, very important that I own that my TV won't even work with the 3D thing anymore because those glasses are garbage.

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
And that's Tron.

55:44.000 --> 55:45.000
Oh shit.

55:45.000 --> 55:53.000
And so I could watch Tron Legacy in the PlayStation VR and, like, never before have I wanted a PlayStation VR so bad. Isn't that sad?

55:53.000 --> 55:56.000
But it's true. I'm not gonna sit here and lie.

55:56.000 --> 56:00.000
Like, the thing that might finally break me is being able to watch Tron Legacy in PlayStation VR.

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
And I do have a PlayStation VR.

56:02.000 --> 56:09.000
For you, I would even let you borrow the other Blu-ray 3D movie I have, The Lion King.

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
No thanks. I'm good.

56:12.000 --> 56:16.000
But yeah, Tron. Man, that's pretty awesome.

56:16.000 --> 56:22.000
And that's awesome about the hard drive thing too. Now, Stobby in chat is asking, is the hard drive support only for Pro?

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
No, I believe it's for both systems.

56:24.000 --> 56:27.000
Yeah, I don't see why that would be limited.

56:27.000 --> 56:34.000
Really, the Pro really, I mean, if you haven't played with the Pro, it's the exact same as the other PlayStation 4.

56:34.000 --> 56:38.000
It's just some of the inner workings are a little more beefy.

56:38.000 --> 56:45.000
So it's like, you know, like running Windows 10 on two different computers. One of them has a slightly faster processor and better graphics card.

56:45.000 --> 56:51.000
That's kind of what it is, basically. So I don't see why the hard drive thing would be any different.

56:51.000 --> 56:57.000
Now, if only they would announce, oh, and PlayStation 1, 2, and game support.

56:57.000 --> 57:03.000
Then Sony could get up there and drop the mic and jump off the stage like Lady Gaga just did. Right?

57:03.000 --> 57:10.000
Come on. It's a PlayStation Pro. You can't run PlayStation 2 or 2 and 1 games. Shit.

57:10.000 --> 57:14.000
Fucking PCs nowadays can emulate the goddamn Wii U at 60 frames per second.

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
Let's be thankful for what we're getting.

57:16.000 --> 57:22.000
No, I am not. It's just, what we're complacent is when they're like, oh, fuck it, we don't have to do it because they don't care anymore.

57:22.000 --> 57:29.000
That's why Microsoft is fucking working on this shit. No, fuck that. I am not happy with not being able to play these things.

57:29.000 --> 57:34.000
And also not happy with the fact that I do own these PlayStation 2 games or whatever on the PlayStation 3.

57:34.000 --> 57:42.000
Oh, but I'm sorry. That's a separate purchase from the PlayStation 2 games that run on the PlayStation 4 or some bullshit. I don't know.

57:42.000 --> 57:47.000
So we have a chatter over at live.vognetware.com called, come on, NullGus.

57:47.000 --> 57:52.000
Come on, NullGus, who says, there's no shame in your games, Sky.

57:53.000 --> 57:59.000
I want to watch Garrett Hedlung in a skin tight suit in 3D. 3D. I've been drinking a little bit.

57:59.000 --> 58:03.000
Yeah, sure. Thanks. Sure.

58:03.000 --> 58:07.000
Real quick, there was another game that they announced some more improvements for.

58:07.000 --> 58:12.000
Fallout 4 is going to be getting an update on PC and PlayStation 4 Pro.

58:12.000 --> 58:22.000
Pro with the 1.19 patch, they're going to be getting tweaks to lighting and textures are going to be supported at a native 1440p.

58:22.000 --> 58:27.000
And they're improving the draw distance and God Ray effects for PC.

58:27.000 --> 58:35.000
They're having a high resolution texture pack, which is 58 gigabytes of brand new textures that are even more high res.

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
Enjoy that download.

58:37.000 --> 58:42.000
Yikes. I'm sure Alan will download it. If his computer will run it. I don't know.

58:42.000 --> 58:45.000
You might have to have like a state of the art thing to run that.

58:45.000 --> 58:46.000
Can I get a 4K monitor?

58:46.000 --> 58:49.000
Yeah, that's true. He doesn't really have all that 4K fancy stuff.

58:49.000 --> 58:52.000
I did buy him a new monitor, but I don't think that the video card goes that far.

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
But that still sounds cool.

58:54.000 --> 58:58.000
Yeah, I'm looking forward to that. So no word on when the rest of us get the update.

58:58.000 --> 59:02.000
Hopefully soon. I mean, if it's in beta right now, I'm guessing.

59:02.000 --> 59:03.000
Maybe a month.

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
Right around the Switch launch.

59:05.000 --> 59:08.000
Ooh, right around the time for Mass Effect Andromeda. That'd be nice.

59:08.000 --> 59:09.000
When's that coming out? Is it March?

59:09.000 --> 59:10.000
End of March.

59:10.000 --> 59:11.000
End of March.

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
So, that'd be nice.

59:13.000 --> 59:19.000
Even though Mass Effect Andromeda kind of natively embraces the Pro, that's one of the games they've been showing off for it.

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
How much was the Switch again? Was that $299?

59:21.000 --> 59:22.000
That's $299.

59:22.000 --> 59:23.000
$299.

59:23.000 --> 59:26.000
You're thinking about going back, aren't you?

59:26.000 --> 59:30.000
No, I'm not. I was just thinking the Pro being $399.

59:30.000 --> 59:37.000
That's like, well actually PlayStation would be $299. It's like, why? I don't know.

59:37.000 --> 59:41.000
Alright, well moving on. Here's a story about Nintendo and Animal Crossing.

59:41.000 --> 59:44.000
Animal Crossing is supposed to be getting a mobile game soon.

59:44.000 --> 59:48.000
I think a lot of people have been checking out that Fire Emblem Heroes that came out on mobile.

59:48.000 --> 59:51.000
I passed. I didn't check it out.

59:51.000 --> 59:54.000
I actually, here's the thing.

59:54.000 --> 59:58.000
I'm not really super into the Fire Emblem series as it is.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Like the whole permadeath and the fact that the strategy, tactical thing.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:05.000
I'm just not like super duper into those types of games.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
That's cool for people that are, yay.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.000
But I've never really been into it.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:14.000
But I thought maybe the Fire Emblem mobile thing could be like, okay, well if it's free, maybe this would be something that introduces me to it.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.000
And then I heard, because I started seeing all these screenshots on Twitter the day it came out.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
It was all, add me, here's my code.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
And on Facebook, add me, here's my code.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:26.000
And I'm thinking in the back of my head, this fucking game has friend codes?

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:34.000
It doesn't just, it doesn't just tie to your Facebook or tie to your Twitter account like most mobile games these days now do.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Or your My Nintendo account that doesn't have friends with it.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Yes, the whole reason why I thought they were doing these in the first place.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:42.000
The My Nintendo account is supposed to link to that.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Nope, none of that.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:52.000
And look, I know that some mobile games have used codes in the past, but either I'm just not playing enough mobile games, but I don't see them recently anymore.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Like I'm looking at the games I am playing.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Fuck, Super Mario Run used it, used Facebook and Twitter.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Non-Stop Night I'm still playing, that uses that.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Final Fantasy XVS is on Facebook.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Miitomo fucking uses Facebook and Twitter.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Like, I don't, like friend codes are fucking ten years ago. Bye.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:18.000
I'm so shocked that there's some online thing that Nintendo's not getting.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Well, I'm sure they'll have that all ironed out in about four weeks, right?

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
I'm sure that'll be all taken care of.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Fifth Dream in chat is pointing out permadeath can be turned off.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Yeah, I heard that about the mobile game, which is part of what, honestly, had made that more appealing.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:38.000
But you know what? I don't have to go suck on the tit of everything that Nintendo puts out.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
I just don't.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
So, you know what? This one's a pass from me.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:51.000
If people just, if, man, I go to parties and everybody's sitting on their phone playing the game and like, Rob, you have to fucking play this and all this stuff, maybe I'll change my mind.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:54.000
But at this point, I'm not really seeing it. Beyond.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.000
No, I don't have to fucking play this. What are you doing with your life?

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Unless that game that they're playing on their phone is the Jackbox Party Pack?

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:06.000
No, somebody who plays Ingress, not allowed to say that to anybody.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Hey, I don't play it that much, okay?

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Now, I'm not saying that I may have stayed up looking at a map on, you know, a computer talking to people over, you know, the internet, telling them where to go.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:24.000
That may not be a thing I did, but you know what? Seriously, though.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:30.000
I hit level 27 in Pokemon Go this week, though, so you can't say I'm not supporting Nintendo in one way or another.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Although, you know, how much money does Nintendo really get from that game?

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:39.000
They get a cut, I'm sure, but probably not as much as Pokemon Company and Niantic.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Still not getting enough money to fix all the spoofing, cheating problems.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Yeah, well anyway, if you were looking forward, the whole point of this, if you were looking forward to Animal Crossing on mobile, it's delayed.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:55.000
They're just saying it's bumped to the next fiscal year, but to be fair, that is just April or later.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:03.000
So, I guess at one point they had guaranteed it for this fiscal year, or you know, said it would be this fiscal year, but they're bumping it back a little further.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:09.000
I had always thought this was dated for just calendar year 2018, so I wasn't completely disappointed by this.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:18.000
It could be that they're just not either ready with it, or maybe they just want to bump it so that they're, you know, not putting all their money into this quarter or year or something like that.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Well, let's also not forget Super Mario Run still hasn't shown up on Android, so that's something they probably want to get out before the end of March.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Well, they probably are. I think it's supposed to come out in March.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Did they announce it already? They did put a date on that, yeah, yeah.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:37.000
So, anyway, Animal Crossing, we'll just have to wait a little longer. I probably will check that out on mobile.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:46.000
I mean, I just, Lord help me if they don't figure out how to get on Facebook, Twitter, or my Nintendo would be just fine to link to other people.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Man, the microtransactions.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:51.000
If a friend code shows up in Animal Crossing, so help me God.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.000
The microtransactions in that game are going to be fucking off the chain.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:05.000
I, uh, you know what, if the microtransactions are the classic NES games, like in the original Animal Crossing, which is part of what made that game so fucking desirable and great,

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:10.000
which is also why we'll probably never see it on Virtual Console, the GameCube version.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.000
God no, yeah.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:15.000
I would be here for that in a heartbeat. They could charge a little money for that.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Exactly.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Although, those games would not be fun to play on touch screen only.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Maybe something like Clue Clue Land or Balloon Fight or some of the ridiculously simple ones, the controls aren't that serious, but like Mario Brothers and Zelda, that would not be fun at all.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Not be fun at all.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Let's see, Ragenator in chat says, with the next Nintendo game, not only will you need to use friend codes, but you'll have to solve Resident Evil style puzzles, solve Einstein's field equations, translate War and Peace into Aramic in order to add friends, Sky.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Yeah, sounds about right. Sounds about right.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Dark Sakura, take me to some more pleasant news in gaming.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.000
We've been also playing another thing at my house.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Now, I didn't mention this because I know it was a story.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Mega Man 2.5D remake. Have you seen it?

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Capcom put out another Mega Man game?

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.000
No.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.000
What?

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.000
This is a fan game.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Oh.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Basically, it really is a 2.5D game that kind of tilts and rotates, but it's still mostly 2D.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Except it does some weird tilting when you're climbing up or down things.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:27.000
And you'll go alongside and then the screen will stop and rotate and then you go onto the next part of the stage.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Is it a remake of one of the older games or is it like a new one?

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.000
It's a combination, basically.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Oh.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:44.000
The people behind it did, like, it's got different bosses in it. Like, it's got Quick Man, Snake Man, Splash Woman.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
So, it's a big combination.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Well, they kind of did a hodgepodge from different games.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
And you can play as Proto Man.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:58.000
And also, yes, it's got Shadow Man in it and who was the Pharaoh looking one? I don't remember who he was.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Pharaoh Man?

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Pharaoh Man. Pharaoh Man!

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:07.000
But you can also, it has co-op and versus in it. So, it's pretty neat.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:12.000
It's pretty difficult too, though, but it seems like it's a lot of fun.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
And that's Mega Man 2.5D.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Alright.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.000
By the way, I think it has been taken down off of the site.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:20.000
What a shock.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.000
That would be wrong because I am currently downloading it.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Good. I had to get mine from the torrent link because the other ones were down.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Once on the internet, though, always on the internet.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Yep.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Alright.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Alright, well, let's move on with some more news. Just a couple, oh, yeah.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:45.000
I forgot one thing. If you go on the guy's site and look at the art assets, they totally did a US style one that is so bad.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.000
Oh, like the box art?

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
For cover art, right? It's terrible bad.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:54.000
I have to check that out. Yeah, I really need to. I want to check that out, hopefully before they take it down.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:58.000
But even if they take it down, I can just get it off Loki's computer.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys than the classic game of the week. But first, Loki.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:06.000
So, remember that thing that they were showing off at E3 2014?

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:12.000
I remember Miyamoto had some concepts that he was working on. One of those was Project Giant Robot.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:16.000
And remember how he said it looked like crap? Well, they cancelled it.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:25.000
So, they're not working on it anymore. Probably makes sense because it was a Wii U concept and they're not making anything for the Wii U anymore.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:35.000
So, since it's not going to translate, I would think you maybe need that second screen for something that probably makes sense that you wouldn't have that on the Switch.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Sucks for those people that wanted to play the game. Not me, I'm not one of them.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:45.000
And I'm hoping that means that, oh, wait, no, that Project Guard did end up being some shitty mini game.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
It was the Star Fox thing, wasn't it?

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:55.000
But, yeah, that was a weird E3. Like, where Nintendo kind of had to justify the Wii U.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:08:00.000
So, they were like, Miyamoto, convince everybody the Wii U gamepad's a good idea.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
And that was what you got.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:09.000
So, alright, well, it's something you're never going to play again.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:15.000
So, you would think they'd at least maybe put out the demo as a free piece of software. Just throw us a bone somewhere.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:22.000
The cancelled game stuff is always weird to me. Anyway, Stoppy in Chat says over at live.fognetwork.com,

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:27.000
I'm so sad about that. It seemed to be the closest we could get to a RAD successor.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Well, let's talk about Retro Studios. What are they working on?

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Well, they're dropping some hints that it might be Metroid Prime.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Now, this could be stretching a little bit.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:42.000
And it all went down on Twitter where there was a tweet that went out to Retro Studios that said,

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Hey Retro Studios, what game are you making? We old people want to know.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Well, the interesting thing is Retro Studios replied and said, we're making something delicious.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
And they replied with a picture.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:56.000
And the picture is like of a delicious looking dinner.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:01.000
I mean, Loki, look at that meat arrangement there. Doesn't that look amazing? Yes.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
Well, here's the interesting thing about it.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:08.000
That's some prime steak you're looking at there. Some prime meats.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:12.000
So people are reading that as confirmed Metroid Prime.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:15.000
That might be a little bit of a stretch, but there you go.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
That's stretching it a bit.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:23.000
It'd be different if like, no, they can't put like a picture of a Metroid in the picture.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Or they're making a game called like Ham and Chili. I don't know.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Chili Prime. Ooh, Chili Prime.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
It's on an ice planet.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:38.000
I would think that would be the type of thing Nintendo would bring to E3 if that is certainly a thing that's happening.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
But we'll find out.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:44.000
This has been a while. Did we talk about, there was another Metroid fan game that I saw that came out.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Like Metroid Zero or something like that that someone put out.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:50.000
I don't think it came up on the show. The last one I remember was the AM2R.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Yeah, this is a brand new one. This is like a Metroid Zero.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:56.000
Oh yeah, I did hear about this. Somebody took like Metroid Zero.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Yeah, it's like a ROM hack and they try to expand on the story before even like Metroid Zero, right?

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
So that looked cool.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Yeah, and something else to look out for and download.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Yep.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Alright, well let's talk about those classics. Games like Metroid that will forever be etched in our memory.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.000
That's why we do a segment like this called the Classic Game of the Week.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Where every week Dark Sakura jumps into the gaming vault head first, swims through her piles and piles of games.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.000
It's sticky.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:33.000
And pulls out one game from the rubble that she declares, this is the game that you all should be playing this week or you are literal garbage.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
Yes, garbage.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:42.000
Just kidding. But you should still respect the Classic Game of the Week and this one I must say, one of my all time favorites too.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
This is a good one. This is a good one.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
What is the Classic Game of the Week, Dark Sakura?

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:50.000
From way back in 2003.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Meaning 10 years or older. 14 years.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:53.000
14 years old.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Yep.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:00.000
Is WarioWare Inc. Mega Microgames. With a dollar sign. Bam!

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:03.000
In Japan it was called Made in Wario.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:09.000
And in PAL it was WarioWare Inc. Minigame Mania.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:14.000
This came out on the Game Boy Advance back in Le Day.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:20.000
And it was the first of the WarioWare game series.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:26.000
So basically, it's all minigames. Just teeny tiny microgames.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:33.000
And they're only a few seconds, but in each of these little games you have to control it of course with your D-Pad and your A-Button.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:41.000
And you have to figure out what you're supposed to do based on a word or phrase that appears and then you get all the conditions you have to finish.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:51.000
You sometimes have to shoot targets, you have multiple choice answers, or you just have to make it through a timer.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:55.000
So you start with four lives and the game ends when you lose all your lives.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:01.000
For the main game you go through all the levels either as Wario or one of his buddies.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:10.000
And then some of them are nature games or puzzle games and some of them are based on Nintendo games.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:17.000
So as you go through them the time goes down more and more until you have to beat them really quickly.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:21.000
And then you also have different boss encounters as you go through.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:27.000
So really it's just minigames. It's fun little crazy minigames.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:31.000
And I have to read the plot because this is great.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:41.000
While at home one evening Wario turns on his TV to see a special report on video game sales going up all due to popular games like Pioro.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:48.000
After thinking for a few seconds Wario realizes that video games may be a potential goldmine for him.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:53.000
The next morning he rushes out and buys a laptop computer and immediately gets to work.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:58.000
He starts making games but when realizing it takes hard work he calls his friends to come and make some games.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Thus WarioWare Inc. is formed with Wario as president of the company.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Basically Wario makes all of his friends make games and he takes the money for himself.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Complete with his cast of characters Wario, Jimmy T, Mona, Dribble and Spitz, 9 Volt, Orbulan, Dr. Crygor, and Cat and Anna.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:32.000
The game has been very popular. It has spawned other versions of itself.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:38.000
Game Informer in 2008 said it was one of the top 10 weirdest games of all time.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:44.000
So for other versions that came out on the GameCube it was WarioWare Inc. Mega Party Games.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:48.000
In Japan it was Atsumare Made in Wario.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:57.000
There were the DSiWare games Paper Plane and Pyoto which are part of the DSiWare digital service.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:06.000
And then we also had re-releases for Virtual Console.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:09.000
And that's it. WarioWare.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:13.000
One of my very favorites. I love this game. It's so fun.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:20.000
I love the classic NES games parts where it's like you just do one little thing from the classic games.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:24.000
I love that the best. I think a lot of people who played WarioWare probably enjoy that.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:28.000
It just made me think if he hired all of his friends to make those games.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:32.000
I bet some of his friends are like, I just lost interest here, it ends here.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Put it on a timer. Who cares.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Alright there it is your classic game of the week. WarioWare Inc.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.000
The Microgames. One of my all time favorites.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:45.000
Alright we are going to take a break but we have plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come after the break.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:51.000

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:54.000
Orange Lounge Radio. All one word on Skype.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:58.000
When we come back after this break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
Don't go anywhere.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:10.000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:14.000
On this historical episode number 674.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:17.000
February the 5th of 2017. Historical.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:20.000
No wait that's the Super Bowl because apparently they are in overtime.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
No wonder nobody is listening tonight.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:26.000
Just kidding. We appreciate those of you faithful that are still here showing up.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:29.000
Live in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:34.000
It's about time for us to get into some rapid fire news. Take it away Loki.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:40.000
Alright so there is a brand new shooter that's coming to Playstation VR.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
Next week actually.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:46.000
Called Dexed. It's being developed by Ninja Theory.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:50.000
And it looks pretty cool. It's kind of like a Panzer Dragoon style game.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:53.000
So that will come out for 10 bucks.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:58.000
Actually I'm sorry that I already came out. So that was apparently last Tuesday.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:02.000
I'll have to try that out. I've been looking for more Playstation VR stuff.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:03.000
So cool.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
Does it give you a headache at all?

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:10.000
No. The only thing that gives me a headache is.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:13.000
I don't know if I try to like lay. Like you know how they with the Playstation VR.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:18.000
They're like oh yeah you can lay back and watch like movies and stuff like that.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:23.000
You can't lay on that because there's like a bar in the back there.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
Oh that sounds annoying.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:28.000
So that would really put a kink in your neck.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Anyways so this is kind of cool. There's another ROM hack.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Now remember we talked about how they put Bubsy into Streets of Rage.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:43.000
Well now this is a little less weird. They put Darkwing Duck into DuckTales 2.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:48.000
So yes you can actually play as Darkwing Duck.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:54.000
And apparently they hacked the two player mode and one of the players is now Darkwing Duck.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
Does he flap in the night?

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.000
Probably.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:58.000
I love Darkwing Duck.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:01.000
So yeah if you want to check that out you can go to ROMhacking.net. Check it out.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:06.000
Cool. Well I have something that's a little bit more.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:13.000
I would say that's been talked about on the last show because I was going to talk about it.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:24.000
But there's something a little bit more about the I guess political action behind the character Diva from Overwatch.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:31.000
And that we've seen for some of the protesting that was going on in Korea as well.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:41.000
That they rallied behind Diva and her little rabbit mascot as you know a rallying cry.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:51.000
But it also came in because of a girl who was pretty much so good at Overwatch that the men accused her of cheating.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:58.000
And just went from there as being I guess a source of pride overall.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:06.000
But now there's a lot more rallying I guess with Diva's little rabbit mascot.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:12.000
They were even protesting against in the women's march.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:15.000
They were in the women's march that happened in Seoul.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:21.000
And I just think it's amazing. It makes me just want to get nothing but shirts with angry rabbits on them.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
I think I'm going to do that now.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:28.000
And then in other news for those of us who are fans of Mass Effect.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:34.000
For Andromeda you get a 10 hour trial of Andromeda 5 days before launch.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:38.000
But that is only if you are an access subscriber.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:43.000
So that will be out on March 16th.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:47.000
And the game is going to be out on March 21st.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:50.000
Gonna be mine. Gonna be mine.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
So it's like you get to play it early.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:55.000
Yeah. And then you have to wait. And then play it some more.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:58.000
It's gonna be mine.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:01.000
I don't know if you know this. Is it going to be a piece from the actual game?

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
Or is it going to be a separate demo?

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:04.000
It doesn't say.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Boo.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:10.000
But I've already decided that when I make my character she's going to be Kamen Rider.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Now it works.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Mine's going to be Richard Rider and I'll let you fill in the gaps.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:21.000
Alright. Moving on. Let's talk about Final Fantasy 15.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:25.000
Remember how everybody hated Chapter 13? Well at least I did. So that means everybody.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:28.000
I haven't gotten to Chapter 13 because I haven't played it anymore.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:29.000
Everyone didn't bother.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
All you need to do is wait until March 28th.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Because the promised changes to Chapter 13 will be occurring on March 28th.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:40.000
That is also by the way the same day as the Gladio DLC will be coming.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
That has also been dated for March 28th.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
What is my VR DLC coming?

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
That has not been dated.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:50.000
But it is interesting because it seems like they're kind of doing something to change the game every month.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:57.000
They're doing little updates. Like they had the Chocobo Moogle Festival in January which I didn't think was very good at all.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:04.000
Like I heard Bobby showing. I know he liked it. I didn't like it at all. I thought it was kind of lame thing that they threw it put in there.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:09.000
Did you see the not Power Rangers costume thing that they're supposed to be doing?

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
And there's February's thing that they're putting in there.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:16.000
Yeah it's like oh yeah we didn't put it out because it was too similar to the Power Rangers. Yeah no shit.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
And there isn't a Power Rangers movie about to hit theaters or anything.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
No not at all.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
They'll be selling Cup Noodle at the movie theaters.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
Cup Noodle.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
Anyway.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:33.000
But you know what I'm looking forward very much to the Gladio DLC and exploring that and so the Chapter 13.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:38.000
I don't know if I want to go back and re-experience Chapter 13 but I kind of feel like I have to.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:42.000
But maybe that's one of those things I can just watch a YouTube right Logie?

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
I'll watch you play it on YouTube or something.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
Yeah right like we're streaming.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:54.000
A little bit of sad news this week. A moment please to remember Masaya Nakamura who passed away this week at the age of 91.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:59.000
A lot of outlets misreporting that he's the creator of Pac-Man.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:02.000
No Masaya Nakamura was not the creator of Pac-Man.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:09.000
But he's tied to Pac-Man because he was the founder of Namco in the year 1955.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:13.000
So actually he passed away on January 22nd.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:21.000
But the news of his passing was given out after the Waken funeral with close relatives was already held.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
That was all at the request of his family.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:29.000
So yes he founded Namco Games who's brought us a lot of great stuff over the years.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:32.000
Unfortunately he passed away this week.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:35.000
But 91 good number. Very good number.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
So great guy for gaming.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:41.000
Alright let's travel around and check out what is in stores this week.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:42.000
Logie?

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
There's a whole ton of stuff coming out this week.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:47.000
I'm kind of surprised because February is usually a little bit busier.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:52.000
But this week we have Altier Sophie the Alchemist of the Mysterious Book on PC.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:55.000
Knights of Xur on PC.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:58.000
Neo coming out in PlayStation 4. That's a pretty big one.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:01.000
And Splasher on PC.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:06.000
Finally the port of WWE 2K17 also out on PC. That is it.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:13.000
And Rob is choking.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:14.000
Sorry.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
Please don't die Rob. We kind of need you.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:21.000
I'm trying to do that thing where I eat in between talking so I'm not chewing and talking to you guys.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:24.000
But yeah I almost choked on what I was eating there.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:27.000
Yeah those things where it slowly goes down your throat.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:30.000
Yeah well there's nothing you can do. It feels like you're choking for the longest time.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
I'm also eating toast with peanut butter.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:36.000
So it's kind of like you know sometimes if you try to swallow that too fast it's like rargh.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
So anyway.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:43.000
Let's talk about what's coming out in Japan this week on the PlayStation 4.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:48.000
So this week we have on February the 9th.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:54.000
Four Goddesses Online Cyber Dimension Neptune comes out in Irregular and Royal Edition.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
Neptuneia.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:00.000
Sengoku Musou 4-2 gets a price reduction that's already been out.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:04.000
But it's going to be a price reduction into the best collection over there.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
And that's honestly really it.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:12.000
That Four Goddesses Online Cyber Dimension Neptune is really the biggest release on the PlayStation 4 this week.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:15.000
It does not appear that that carries over to the Vita.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:19.000
Vita is actually dry this week in Japan. Usually there's a ton of stuff.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
But not this week.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:29.000
However on the Nintendo 3DS there is Dragon Quest Monsters Joker 3 Professional that is out this week.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:32.000
So a lot of folks really into Dragon Quest and spinoff games.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
So I'm sure folks will be checking that out.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
But that's really it as far as Japan is concerned.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:37.000
How about Europe DarkSakura?

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
Jack shit.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
Really that's it.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
Alright.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
Then let's go to the mailbag.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
Well DarkSakura we got to make you do some work.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:50.000
So let's get to our mailbag.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
Every week you guys send us emails.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:55.000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:58.000
DarkSakura dives in the mailbag head first and pulls out an email.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
Thanks. Hey.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
This is worth reading on air.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:03.000
Yep.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
So DarkSakura what is in the email bag this week?

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
Just one to catch up on from the missed show last week.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Only one worth reading.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.000
Fair enough.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:11.000
Hello LR.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:18.000
Last week you guys discussed the rumored possibility that Nintendo Switch will lack Netflix, Hulu and other streaming apps.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:24.000
Plus we already know that Nintendo will be offering features such as voice chat and matchmaking through smartphone apps.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:31.000
I believe the real issue here is that Nintendo is potentially failing to understand the importance of an entertainment ecosystem.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:35.000
As a console manufacturer you want to keep folks engaged in your ecosystem.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Excuse me.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:44.000
For example Microsoft wants you to spend as much time on your Xbox One as possible regardless of whether you're actually playing games on it.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:49.000
After all the more time you spend there the more likely it is that you'll make purchases on Xbox One.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:57.000
If I shut it down and turn on my PS4 instead that means I'll be spending time and possibly money in Sony's ecosystem rather than Microsoft's.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:03.000
If Nintendo fails to provide streaming apps they are discouraging folks from staying within their ecosystem.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:11.000
But even worse is the fact that they are actually sending folks to other ecosystems by providing Switch related features on iOS and Android platforms.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:18.000
I mean since you're now in front of your phone anyway you may as well check on your mobile games, social media, messaging apps and so on.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:21.000
Many of which allow you to spend money somewhere else.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:25.000
I must say I'm not quite sure if this is their best possible strategy.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:29.000
Can I just commend YYR that is a really good way of putting it honestly.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:38.000
Like that is a really good way of putting like where my because you know last week there was a lot of you guys that disagreed with me on the whole Netflix saying like the system doesn't need Netflix.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:46.000
But I'm just kind of like I just still think they are making a huge mistake and I think YYR really put words there to what I was thinking.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:49.000
At least I'm going to claim that's what I was thinking because that was a really good argument. Thank you.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:52.000
Rob you also mentioned Project Diva Future Tone.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:26:02.000
Yes the price tag is off putting at first but I spent over $80 on just the two base packs for the identical Japanese release and I can say this much.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:08.000
If you will actually play it for the many many hours of entertainment it can provide it is absolutely worth every penny.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:15.000
The list of over 200 songs spans the entire series and not much is left out plus the note charts are all unique to this version.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:24.000
I will mention that the DLC is coming some content including new songs and additional charts for existing songs was added to the arcade version after the PS4 version came out.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:27.000
The DLC brings the PS4 version up to date.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:35.000
If you want all of it is $25 bringing the grand total for everything to $79.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:42.000
Once again if you are enough of a fan that you will actually play this thing for the hundred plus hours of fun it will provide it's still worth it.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:50.000
Considering how good of a value it actually is I'm not sure when or if they'll put it on sale. I already own the Japanese version as well.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
It's Sega it'll go on sale.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:27:03.000
So I wasn't in much of a rush to buy the American release but what I plan to do is wait for another one of Sony's spend $100 get 15 or similar PSN promotions to get a pseudo discount.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
So if you're still on the fence you could do that as well.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:14.000
Not a bad idea. I feel like YYR should be the official legal counsel of OLR. He's made some good arguments tonight.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:17.000
I mean I know he's not actually a lawyer but neither are we.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:22.000
Lastly thanks for having me. I feel like one fucking lately.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
Oh a lawyer?

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
I will pause for just a moment.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:31.000
My mother reads the stupid red sites that are nothing but you know bullshit.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:32.000
Clickbait.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:37.000
Yeah but they literally are full of lies. I've gone on her page and looked at this shit.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
Like the whole Gaga is going to do a satanic ritual today.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:40.000
Whatever.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
I was actually sad she didn't.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:54.000
So I have actually been going on like and pulling like legal records and cases and shit to say here's where what you just said was wrong.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:55.000
Doesn't matter.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:56.000
I know.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:01.000
To be fair it happens on the other side too. It just seems to be happening more often lately.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:02.000
My mom doesn't know how to do it.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:03.000
I know.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
She's like well it's on the national news. What national news?

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:06.000
Fox News.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:11.000
Anyway lastly thanks for having Matt Baum on the show last week.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:17.000
The interview was really interesting and now I'm going to be giving the Defining Marriage podcast a shot.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:20.000
I was not aware that he had also published a book by the same name.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:21.000
He did.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:26.000
Thanks as always for being awesome. Have a great week. Lots of hugs Aaron YYR.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:34.000
I hope you tweeted that at Matt and anybody who enjoyed him on the show last time tweet him and say you enjoyed the interview.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:40.000
Because you know that helps people know that OLR is a great place to come pitch your story.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:43.000
Did someone send an email about Kigurumi?

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
Yeah it was the week you were gone.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:52.000
Oh and you know what I actually was wrong about games because I was looking in January and it's February.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:56.000
Oh so you want to go back and alter your UK releases?

01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:02.000
Yeah hold on. Because when you link them to me you're always giving me like September 2016.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:05.000
Oh sorry. Oh so now it's my fault.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:06.000
Yes it is your fault.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:07.000
Now it's my fault. You know what?

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:08.000
Girl.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
Those were just the alternative release dates.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:11.000
The alternative. Okay.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:19.000
On the 7th is Fallout Shelter for Xbox One and the 9th is Neo for Playstation 4 and IOH. That's it.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:25.000
Which is apparently one of those like hard as hell kind of games. Like Dark Souls but like at 11.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:34.000
Which you know Dark Souls is nightmare enough. I was watching, I didn't play it myself but I was watching someone play Dark Souls 3 this weekend.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:35.000
Did you poop?

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:36.000
What?

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:37.000
Did you poop?

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:40.000
Well yes but not because of the game.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
Everybody does Dark Sakura.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
I have a book about that you know.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:47.000
Yes I know I know.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:50.000
By the way I found my copy of Come Out Squirtle.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:53.000
Did you? Mine's over here in the...

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:54.000
Yep.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:57.000
It's next to my video games for some weird reason.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:58.000
How apropro.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:09.000
Alright let's move on. We gotta get to some other news stories and then your calls at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.000
Loki.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:17.000
Alright so we finally got some news regarding the whole online service for the Nintendo Switch.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
They've come out with the pricing for it.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:27.000
So they're saying that the annual cost is going to be between 2000 and 3000 yen or approximately 1760 to 2640 a year.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:33.000
And they're also saying that they're considering adding virtual reality as an option for the Switch.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:37.000
I really don't see that happening at least with this device.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:45.000
And but if they're able to resolve the issues of discomfort of VR over multiple hours.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:51.000
Let's put it this way. That system is not the dimensions nor is it the resolution for VR.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
I just don't see that happening.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
I just don't.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:31:02.000
Maybe phones can do it but it won't be anything better than like the Samsung Gear VR or something like that.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
What do you think of that lower price though?

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:12.000
I have to see what we're getting with that. It doesn't matter what the price is. The fact that they pay anything for it.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
What am I getting with that?

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:17.000
Well I'm glad at least based on what we're hearing so far.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:27.000
Because I think we did kind of rant a little bit two weeks ago about what the hell are we going to be paying 60 bucks a month for if we're not really getting something that's equal to 60 a year.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
Or sorry 60 a year not a month.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:36.000
But you know it's nice to hear that okay even though it does sound like it's going to be a rental as opposed to a purchase.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:43.000
It's still not okay. I think that's stupid. I think it's stupid. Don't even give it out if you're going to just take it right back.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:53.000
I think if anything they should at least give you one virtual console game. I mean they've made their money on these games a long time ago.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:32:01.000
There is no value being lost there to them. I mean but they're just greedy and want more money for those virtual console games.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:07.000
They've made millions of dollars for them. You know several millions of dollars for them each one.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:15.000
So there's no point in not being able to give that at least even if you're going to say okay we're only going to do one game.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:19.000
One virtual console game a month. It's still better than nothing.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:24.000
And we still don't know what exactly feature wise is going to be available with this.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:31.000
So even if it was like say $24 a year say $2 a month. What am I getting with that.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:35.000
That's what I want to know is like show me something that's actually going to be valuable here.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:42.000
Like how is right now Nintendo's track record with networking has not been good.

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:47.000
I mean look we just talked about it not too long ago that they're still doing friend codes in like one of their games.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:50.000
They can't even get a service like they have.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:56.000
They can't get the marketplaces to talk to each other you know like your purchases on the Wii U aren't transferring over to the Wii U.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:00.000
And you know that you'd have to pay an upgrade fee for that. Fuck that.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:07.000
It shouldn't be happening. If you bought it a virtual console game on one system it should be able to just unlock for free in the other one.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:15.000
I mean Sony's guilty for this as well with the PlayStation 2 stuff. At least their excuse is that oh we have to create an emulator for it and all that stuff.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:22.000
But I don't know I still want to get more details regarding what exactly I'm getting for that kind of money.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:27.000
And also that you know for me it doesn't really make much of a difference right now because I don't have the system.

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:36.000
But if they're launching with a partial feature set there's there's no like streaming apps there's a lot of stuff missing that's just staples with other platforms.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:41.000
And you got to be on par with those other platforms I would think if you want to have a comparable product.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:49.000
And you can't just say well we're just not competing so that's how we get away with it. Fuck that. You're in the marketplace. You're competing.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:56.000
We'll see what it looks like on holiday. I don't know. I'm not rehashing this again. Let's move on.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Okay so we have to talk about something and you know there's a lot of politics going on in the world.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:08.000
And I know some of you listen to OLR to escape politics to talk about video games here.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:14.000
But the reality is some stuff is going on in the world that is actually impacting the games industry.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:21.000
So these worlds are colliding so you kind of you kind of have to pay attention to what's going on around you.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:31.000
So I'm sure a lot of you guys have heard about the executive order that banned immigration and visas from seven different countries.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:32.000
Overruled.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:42.000
Which yes has been overruled by a judge. I believe the Department of Justice filed an urgent appeal or whatever they call it.

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:48.000
Which was denied. That doesn't mean to be fair that doesn't mean the ban is permanently overruled.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:53.000
The appeal can still go through. It just will not be fast. It will not be urgent immediately.

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
The appeal actually got rejected.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:59.000
Oh was it? I thought the fast appeal was rejected. Not the full appeal.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:04.000
That could possibly be it but I saw I read it just the other day while I was high on meds.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:09.000
Regardless, it's not over. Even if it stays.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
Our so-called president.

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:18.000
So look anyway here's the deal and I'm not just talking about the fact that you know and I think a lot of you were seeing this on blogs going around this week.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:30.000
That Nasir Gebelli who was an Iranian immigrant if I recall correctly was actually the programmer on the original Final Fantasy game.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:41.000
So he worked for Square at the time and created basically the original NES. I mean it was made in Japan but he did like the coding for it for the NES version of it.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:44.000
He also did games like 3D World Runner, Rad Racer, Secret of Mana, etc.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:55.000
So despite however you feel about this issue which I just want to make it very clear. It's crap. I feel personally it is total fucking crap.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:02.000
Because America was founded on people coming from other places and we call ourselves the melting pot.

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:05.000
Anyway try to get off my soapbox.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:06.000
Only if you're white.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:11.000
I'm going to try to get off my soapbox. Well you know what white people weren't here to begin with.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
I just had that chat with my mother today.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:18.000
I know I know. Anyway get off my soapbox and try to stick to the facts here.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:26.000
And that is the fact that you know the ESA the Entertainment Software Association has come out and said some things against the ban.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:36.000
So the ESA said the Entertainment Software Association urges the White House to exercise caution with regard to vital immigration and foreign worker programs.

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:44.000
As a leading force in technology and exporter of entertainment the U.S. video game industry thrives on the contribution of innovators and storytellers from around the world.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:49.000
While recognizing that enhancing national security and protecting our country's citizens are critical goals.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:53.000
Our companies rely on the skilled talent of U.S. citizens, foreign nationals and immigrants alike.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:58.000
Our nation's actions and words to support their participation in the American economy.

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:03.000
And look a lot of people tech companies as well coming out with very similar language against the ban.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:09.000
Washington was the state where this was successfully overturned.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:17.000
And that is because of companies like Microsoft, big technology company, Amazon and other Washington based companies.

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
Expedia I think was the other one.

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
And we've had more local ones speaking out too.

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:27.000
Well sure lots of companies speaking out but I'm just talking specifically Washington for a minute because that's the reason why this got overturned in the moment.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:31.000
And Microsoft obviously a big part of the gaming thing as well.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:37.000
But they spoke out and said this ban immediately directly affects what we're doing.

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:43.000
Because Nasir came over here and you know Final Fantasy is what it is because of him.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:47.000
That is continuing in all these gaming companies right.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:56.000
Guess what if you enjoy a video game there's a very very very fucking good chance that somebody from one of these seven countries had their hand in it somewhere.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
So it's affecting all these countries.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:03.000
And that's why you have all these companies that are coming out and saying this sucks.

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:11.000
Because you know we had somebody coming over here that was going to you know be investigating the cure for whooping cough was it.

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:17.000
And you know can't get here because of your arbitrary brush against these countries.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:22.000
Basically their racism and Islamophobia is getting in the way of what the country was founded on.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:27.000
Coming together as a diverse people to make a better life.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:30.000
And we were already vetting people for the record.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:35.000
If you want to talk about the bad people that caused the Bowling Green massacre never forget.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
Never remember.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
They vet people already.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:43.000
We need to wait to talk about the whole Bowling Green thing until it actually happens.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
You know what I'm saying.

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:49.000
I wouldn't wish that on the community of Bowling Green, Ohio or Kentucky.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
So I did a little search.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:55.000
You were right it's on the quick overturn.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:39:01.000
They are telling them they have to file paperwork and there's already a motion started for impeachment.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
Oh that I didn't know.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:10.000
I honestly thought the impeachment thing was going to be like a daily thing that somebody in the house would put on the floor.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
Just like overturning the Affordable Care Act.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:16.000
It actually was started by Maxine wasn't it?

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:20.000
By a Dallas lawmaker.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:25.000
But then who's going to take over when President Bannon gets taken out of office?

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:28.000
That's okay Trump will still bend over for him.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:34.000
They will find somebody else to be the Muppet in Chief that Bannon can put his hand up their ass I'm sure.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:41.000
Anyway moving on I want to talk about Devolver Digital because this is a very good thing that Devolver is doing.

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:45.000
Well they shouldn't have to fucking do it but they're doing it so good on them snaps for you.

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:52.000
So Devolver Digital put out an open call to developers basically saying hey if you're unable to come to GDC this year.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:40:01.000
If you're getting shut out of GDC because of this ban just like Oscar nominated filmmakers are not able to attend the ceremonies because of the ban.

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:12.000
Devolver Digital is saying in a press release that we will demo the game for you at what's called Devolver Underground which is going to be near the convention center.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:24.000
I think Devolver was probably already always planning to show their own games this way but they're basically saying they have gaming PCs, they have Vive VR headsets available, space is limited.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:32.000
They're going to prioritize developers who had already made travel plans to GDC but have had to cancel in light of what's going on.

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:38.000
GDC the official organization has said they will refund people if you have been affected by this.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:43.000
Which hopefully thanks to what happened in Washington and hopefully things stay that way.

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:50.000
Hopefully these folks can come over here anyway but at the same time I couldn't fault them if they didn't want to at this point.

01:40:50.000 --> 01:41:02.000
So anyway Devolver Digital is going to be doing this so cool at least these games will get to be seen at GDC if they want at this point.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:12.000
Alright that's it. That's my political story for now so let's move on. Let's talk about something else that sucks StarSakura.

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:15.000
I know you're ready to talk about something else that sucks.

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:19.000
I don't know exactly how accurate this is.

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
It's Bad News Sunday.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:26.000
Look what happens when the Patriots win the fucking Super Bowl.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
Well it did happen with the election too.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:33.000
Bad News Sunday. That's right. Bad News 2017. Anyway but at least Betty White's still alive.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:38.000
One of my friends just said that the Super Bowl was a parable for the election.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:41.000
Can we not?

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
Let's not. It's all dumb.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:54.000
Anyway apparently GameStop has been I'm going to say discouraging their employees from selling unopened copies of games.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:57.000
They have a program called the Circle of Life.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:02.000
The Circle of Life. It's a movie about lions.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:07.000
Maybe you need to borrow my Blu-ray. Lion King 3D.

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:10.000
That was a clap back to part A.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:13.000
You know I freaking have that on laserdisc I think.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:24.000
Anyway so basically they get percentage quotas for pre-orders, reward card subscriptions, and used game sales and then game trade-ins.

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:28.000
Each of these quotas are based on their total transactions.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:34.000
So pre-orders and reward cards are the big ones of course.

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:51.000
Used game sales and trade are some sort of calculation that they have for what's going to make the money.

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:57.000
Scam. It's a scam. That's the word you're looking for. Scam.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:02.000
So basically if someone goes in to pick up a game without pre-ordering a game,

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:07.000
subscribing for a rewards card, buying a used game, or trading in some games to help pay for it,

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:11.000
the transaction will knock down those four percentages.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:16.000
Because it's based on total number of sales and what percentage of them make up a certain thing.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:31.000
So now apparently this is coming from a GameStop staff member who says that they're telling people that they don't have a game in stock so they can sell a used one.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:38.000
So that it doesn't hit their numbers. This is apparently going company-wide.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:51.000
So they'll say that, for example, game A is out new. They don't have it so they'll sell it pre-owned.

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:57.000
Or just say fucking used. So they'll sell the used one.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:06.000
And that it also, each employee gets a perk for selling within those parameters.

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:14.000
So just be cognizant of it when you go in.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:19.000
Like if someone goes in and you don't have a reservation for a game, you can just tell them,

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:23.000
if this is your circle of life thing, go get me the game.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:29.000
I would just say, well, A, I haven't shopped at GameStop in years anyway.

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:32.000
I have been in them, so I know they've changed.

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:39.000
I will say, okay, fine, I did buy one thing at a GameStop and it was in Atlanta when I was at DragonCon.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:42.000
I bought a lanyard at GameStop because I forgot to.

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:48.000
Every year I'm notorious for forgetting a fucking lanyard for DragonCon because it's the one convention that doesn't give you one.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:55.000
So I went with our pal Misty, who listens to this show, on a train to go to the mall.

01:44:55.000 --> 01:45:00.000
We went to GameStop and I got a lanyard. It's a sweet lanyard. I will say that. It's a Pokemon lanyard.

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:04.000
But it's the one thing I've got at GameStop in like the past three years.

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:10.000
Because I just go to other, you know, and so if somebody were to pull that line on me, I would just be like,

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:13.000
alright, well, I'll go to Amazon. Thanks. Leave.

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:17.000
I wouldn't take it out on the employees and that's one thing we all need to remember in this.

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:23.000
Is that these people that work at GameStop probably hate this fucking thing as much as the rest of us do.

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
And they're just trying to make a living.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:26.000
It's, yeah, I mean...

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
It affects their paycheck too.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:29.000
Yeah.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:32.000
Their whole thing, I mean, I understand why they're doing it.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:39.000
It's, you know, to keep it profitable because there's more of a profit margin for used games than new games.

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:45.000
There's no profit margin on hardware and that's why they have to do this in order to stay profitable to keep the business going.

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:47.000
It still sucks though.

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:57.000
But, and it sucks that, you know, the employees feel that they have to do this in order to keep up these standards because there is such high turnover.

01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:02.000
It reminds me of like a lot of like the call center environments and stuff like that where there's the, you know,

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:06.000
oh yeah, they hit a certain quota or else, you know, you better be working more hours.

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:07.000
You better rush those people off the phone.

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:08.000
Yeah.

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
Which is like the worst thing you can possibly do.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:16.000
But anyway, Akuma JP in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, we don't have condoms right now.

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
You can buy this used condom though.

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:19.000
Ew.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:22.000
Now, now.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
It's a previously owned condom.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:32.000
Dungeon Buster says, this article helped me find a cheaper deal on Watch Dogs 2.

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:36.000
A GameStop employee mentioned that Watch Dogs was 29 at GameStop.

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
It isn't, at least according to their site.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:43.000
While the used version is 54, but Best Buy actually had it for 29 at the time.

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
I did some digging.

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
The policy is also not new at GameStop.

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:53.000
When it was Babbage's, there was also a drive to push ads on purchases like magazines, et cetera, to help numbers.

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:57.000
Well, in retail, they're always going to upsell you things anyway.

01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:03.000
Which I think in general, by the way, just to get a little tangenty for a minute.

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:07.000
These sorts of policies are what's turning people to online.

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:10.000
And why people don't like shop in stores anymore.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:16.000
Because I don't want to use the broad stroke, millennials, but I'm going to in this case.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:19.000
And I even kind of loop myself in, even though technically based on my year, I'm Gen X.

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:23.000
But I mean, what are these labels anyway, but whatever.

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:32.000
But millennials don't like that pressure of going into a store and knowing that they're going to get upsold all this shit.

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
Who does? No one does.

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
Yeah, that's right. I was going to say, kind of no one does.

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
It's like not the millennials, it's anybody.

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:41.000
Remember when they used to fucking do magazine subscriptions with Best Buy and stuff?

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:45.000
Like you purchase something with a credit card and get signed up for like a magazine.

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:54.000
The reason why I use that broad stroke, just to be clear, is because I think now that that technology is there that makes it easy to go somewhere else where you don't have to deal with people.

01:47:54.000 --> 01:48:02.000
I mean, fucking A. Even Starbucks now, which usually has pretty much the friendliest employees I see, right?

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:07.000
I don't usually get angry baristas, but maybe once in a huge while.

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
Like usually the people at Starbucks are very pleasant to interact with.

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:17.000
But even at Starbucks, I can punch in my order on the phone, hit the thing, walk over to Starbucks, the drinks already on the counter.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:20.000
I pick it up and I walk out the door like I fucking stole it.

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:25.000
And listen, round table, I don't want your fucking wings, okay?

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:29.000
You've been offering me your brand new wings for like several years now.

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:33.000
I'm ordering a fucking pizza, I don't want your goddamn wings.

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:38.000
Now Bob Coffee points out upselling happens online also, service plan, lolz.

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:46.000
You know, that's true, but I think it's easier to tell a monitor no than it might be for some people to look someone in the eye and tell them no.

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:52.000
Plus you don't have the pressure of like that person basically knows that that's their commission.

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:57.000
Look at a site like when you go and register a web domain, right?

01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:03.000
You can do a cheap web domain for like really low cost, but then it's like, well, add this and add this.

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:09.000
And don't you want the dot org and the dot net and the dot xxx and all this other stuff too?

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
I do want the dot xxx.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:17.000
You know, like, oh my god, like that is someone like the worst online with the upselling that I've ever seen, right?

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:21.000
But it's still pretty easy to get around, you know, so it's just different.

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:28.000
But my whole point to this whole thing was, I think that is why you have a lot of retail that's fucking hurting.

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:33.000
Like fucking Macy's is about to go under, it seems like, or it's going to get bought or something like that.

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:38.000
And it's like, Macy's is like the department store at every fucking mall.

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:49.000
And they're about to, they're looking at tough times right now because people will buy clothes online because they don't even need to try them on in a real store anymore.

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:53.000
If it doesn't fit, they just put it in the box and send it back and the clothes people are still making money.

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:56.000
So it's just, it just, yeah.

01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:05.000
Anyway, these policies, so the fact that this came out for GameStop and is out there and circulating the internet is really bad news to them.

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:13.000
So I don't, and I don't know if you've seen anything on this Dark Soccer or Logie, anybody, has GameStop tried to put a cork on this in the past few days that this has happened?

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
I haven't seen anything.

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:19.000
I haven't seen anything either. So if they have tried to put a cork on it, it hasn't been effective.

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:22.000
Maybe it's on their Twitter or some shit, I don't know.

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:27.000
Or it's true and they're having to deal with a fallout, you know?

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:30.000
And some folks in chat are saying, yeah, I have friends at GameStop and this is true.

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:39.000
I don't doubt that this is true, but these sorts of policies are killing retail and killing those types of jobs like those folks that are working at GameStop.

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:44.000
So you need to fucking shape up your policies, GameStop.

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:50.000
Especially considering you have a younger audience, you know, usually, who knows how to fucking use online?

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:54.000
Start selling those Wii U games a little cheaper because, my God, fucking Nintendo.

01:50:54.000 --> 01:51:03.000
I wanted to get it. I'm still looking at maybe getting a used copy of Pokken Tournament so my son can play it because he wants a new game.

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:11.000
And they're just not marking that shit down and that's Nintendo's fault because they're not marking that shit down. Not price protecting that shit.

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:18.000
Sorry, William Murderface following up on my Starbucks comment saying, those ordering apps are great if you have weird orders or customized orders.

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:25.000
I imagine that they make it a bit easier for the staff as well. Oh my God, you just hit the nail on the head on why I actually love to use that Starbucks app.

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:32.000
Because we all know that asshole at the counter, who happens to be me, who's always like, okay, can I get a latte?

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:40.000
But I want to get two pumps of the sugar-free this and two pumps of the sugar-free that and I want to get with the nonfat milk.

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:49.000
So I always feel like I'm such an asshole, but with the phone, I can just put it all in and it's fine.

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:55.000
And to be fair, I don't do that all the time. But I feel like I can do that with the phone app a lot easier.

01:51:55.000 --> 01:52:01.000
Otherwise, I'll walk up to the counter and just be like, alright, Skinny Cinnamon Dolce Latte is good enough.

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:07.000
And just order that. But if I want the drink I really want, I'll use the app.

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:15.000
Let's see, Fifth Dream is pointing out plane tickets. Want to rent a car? Get a hotel? Insurance? Yeah, certainly.

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:19.000
But you know what? Back in the day of travel agents, I'm sure it was just as bad.

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:23.000
Travel agents are still around though for some things, right? But that used to be a huge industry.

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:34.000
You wanted to book a trip to Hawaii, you went to a travel agency who booked it for you because your computer couldn't get onto Delta's site to book whatever flight you wanted.

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:42.000
So, anyway. I'll be interested to see if GameStop tries to do any damage control on this, but I've already seen a lot of-

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:43.000
I don't think that they will at this point.

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:46.000
A lot of people on social media are kind of like, well fuck if I ever shop-

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:51.000
You can't say no, that's not true. I just won't say anything. People will forget.

01:52:51.000 --> 01:53:00.000
A lot of people I've seen at GameStop, or excuse me, on social media are like, well fuck if I ever shop at GameStop again and I can't help but think, you just now are going to start to be-

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:08.000
I still purchase the power-up card because occasionally I will buy something to use and it does end up saving me money.

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
It's only 15 bucks a year, I don't really care about that.

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:18.000
And I used to like the magazine, but now even their magazine that comes in the mail, I kind of like skim through it like five seconds and then throw it away.

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:28.000
I mean, it's just, it's like oh goody, reviews for games I've already read the reviews for several weeks ago. It's not interesting anymore.

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:32.000
So, I don't know. Even the value of that's kind of going away.

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:37.000
Alright, we're going to get to the Skype line here real soon. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:43.000
But first, we need to pep up the mood here a little bit on Bad News Sunday.

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:46.000
You know what we're going to need to do, Loki? We need to do some nudity.

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:52.000
That's just going to have to happen. We need some nudity to pep us up and end on a happy note.

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:55.000
Yes. So, for Valentine's Day-

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:56.000
Not from us!

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:57.000
Thank God!

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
In gaming. Nudity in gaming.

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:05.000
So, for Valentine's Day, you can celebrate with Dead or Alive Xtreme 3.

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:16.000
They're going to have some brand new Valentine's Day garb, which really just consists of ribbons strategically placed on a woman's body.

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:19.000
And you can purchase that coming soon.

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:24.000
Yeah. Oh, and it'll be free. So, that's pretty awesome.

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:33.000
And then, of course, to go along with that, there is an exploit to see the women without their bathing suits on.

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:43.000
Yes. If you have a Playstation VR, and you happen to be doing the photo mode that they have in there, and you dip your head under the water, the suits won't render.

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:47.000
But thankfully, they didn't spend the time to draw genitalia in, so you can-

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:48.000
It's just the bottom part.

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
You can just see, you know-

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
So, it's Barbie doll bottom.

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:53.000
You can see butt crack.

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
Yeah, you can see Barbie stuff.

01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:03.000
So, they didn't render it because they didn't want something happening like what happened to the Elder Scrolls.

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:10.000
They knew. Okay, listen. They know better. They're like, okay, listen. We put genitals on there. People are going to take that shit off.

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:19.000
Alright. Well, now, here's the thing. Now, usually Dark Sakura, wouldn't you follow up a story like this by saying, now, where are the Dongs?

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:23.000
Where's my Dead or Alive Xtreme that has the Dongs?

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:24.000
I don't care.

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:25.000
Alright, well-

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:28.000
Because there's no guys in the game except for Teletubby.

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:31.000
Pretend to care for me for a minute because-

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000
Okay, I'll care for five seconds.

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:36.000
There's a brand new game out there called Conan Exiles.

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:37.000
What?

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
And you've probably never heard of Conan Exiles.

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:40.000
No.

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:41.000
Is it like Conan the Barbarian?

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:51.000
Yes, it is. It's that same type of thing. And here's the thing. A lot of people hadn't heard of Conan Exiles until word got out via early access marketing and so forth.

01:55:51.000 --> 01:56:05.000
For some reason, the PR team failed to mention that when you customize your character in Conan Exile, you get to customize the genitals. That's right.

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
And they're crucified.

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:16.000
Yes, in the opening of the game or whatever. There is actually a slider bar for endowment. So you can play-

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:19.000
This is the funniest thing I've ever seen.

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:29.000
Dark Sakura looks like she just woke up, I was going to say on Christmas, but on Hanukkah to find an endowment slider under the menorah.

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:32.000
I truly do not care about dick that much.

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:33.000
I know, I know.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:39.000
But it's just funny because it's like, little, big, little, big, porn, little.

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:45.000
Now it's like, oh, now everybody else can, you know, experience what's happened with the booby slider for years.

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:46.000
Pornstar.

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:53.000
Now to be fair, also, Conan does let you play as a female character and you are able to-

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:54.000
Give her a huge clit?

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:59.000
Besides the- I hadn't investigated that, Dark Sakura. I don't know if you can-

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
You've heard Large Penis as well?

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:02.000
I have no idea.

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
Can we make an intersex character? That would be cool.

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:08.000
You know what? Fucking email Funcom because I didn't ask these questions.

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:18.000
But you do have a breast slider on the women that you can have big boobies or little boobies or whatever you desire.

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
Here's the interesting thing about it.

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
That's why the guy does balls bounce.

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:27.000
You know, there's GIFs on this thing and it's hilarious.

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:33.000
So look, Dark Sakura hadn't heard about this fucking game, probably wouldn't have given two shits about it.

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:34.000
I'm going to play this shit now.

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:38.000
See? This is what- look at what's fucking happening.

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:42.000
All of a sudden, there's penis in a video game and everybody's like,

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
What? Penis?

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
And it's like- I shit you not.

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:49.000
It's the like fourth most popular game on Twitch right now.

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:52.000
Everybody's streaming penis.

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
It's so funny because the-

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
Are you not supposed to be doing that? Don't they have rules against it?

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:57.000
Or hilarious.

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:58.000
I think Twitch-

01:57:58.000 --> 01:57:59.000
But it's not real penis.

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
Twitch does have some rule against it.

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:08.000
Like it can't be the focus, but like if it happens to be in the game, they kind of can't- like-

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:11.000
Oh my god, he even gave him the butthole.

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:21.000
Loki, if that were the hard fast rule on Twitch, I wouldn't be able to stream God of War because there's naked ladies in that.

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:29.000
So they have to kind of be like, well, as long as it's not the focus of the game, but it's certainly the focus of half the streamers out there right now.

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
I have to put this in the chat room.

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:36.000
I'm sure a lot of chatters are probably signing onto Twitch right now to check it out if they haven't already seen it.

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:37.000
These are the gifts.

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:41.000
And as a reminder, we're focused on the boys right now, but it does have women in it as well.

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:42.000
Caution, dong.

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:49.000
If you want to run around with your, you know, tatas and the whole South America hanging out, that's fine.

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:55.000
Rust kind of did that, but except being able to adjust the size of that, you know, they just did it randomly.

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
And also I think they randomly signed your gender as well.

01:58:57.000 --> 01:59:05.000
And then, of course, let's not forget that Saints Row has this available as well, except they don't actually have, you know, genitals being rendered.

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
It's just kind of a bulge that you have in there.

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:13.000
I agree with, with, come on, Noel.

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:14.000
Whatever.

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
Come on, Noel Gus.

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
I desire a happy trail slider.

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:21.000
I wonder if you can control their hair.

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000
I don't know if you can do body hair.

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:26.000
You could go on full on bear if you wanted, I don't know.

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:27.000
I haven't studied.

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:33.000
Now here's the amazing thing. You have all these stories floating around out there about Conan Exile's dog slider.

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
Still couldn't tell you how the game plays.

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
What kind of game is it? I don't know.

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:41.000
The game where you jump up and down and watch a penis bounce.

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:52.000
I, I think it's one of those like third person collect things and craft things in the new world.

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
Why don't we just do like, I mean, come on.

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:57.000
I mean, Dead or Alive is kind of going that way anyways with Dead or Alive Xtreme.

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
Let's just do another Dead or Alive Xtreme 4.

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
Just full nudity, full rendered everything.

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
Have guys and women there.

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:04.000
Done.

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:05.000
They're porn games.

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:06.000
We're, we're good.

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
Fifth Dream in chat says, I hear it's a survival game.

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:09.000
So great.

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:12.000
This is what happens when you put buttholes in Minecraft.

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:19.000
I, I had to put those two gifs in chat because they're just so funny.

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:25.000
And then people are going to be trying to like swing their penis using the physics of the game into someone else's butthole and shit like that.

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:27.000
Is it multiplayer?

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:30.000
It is. Obviously, if it's a survival game, it's got to be multiplayer.

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:31.000
I guess, I guess it's got to be, right?

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:32.000
I don't know. It's in early access right now.

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:36.000
At least it wasn't like that one game that had the dicks with the butts on them.

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
Cock jousting or whatever it was.

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:40.000
Yeah, it was like a penis jousting.

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:41.000
General jousting.

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:42.000
General jousting. Yeah, that was the whole thing.

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
Did you ever see that one Dark Soccer?

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:45.000
Yes, I did.

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
I swear you were here when it came up on the show, yeah.

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:48.000
Yes.

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
Anyway, there you go.

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:59.000
Tigerclaw says, on Steam, an open world survival game set in the brutal lands of Conan the Barbarian.

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:05.000
Survive in a hostile world, build your kingdom, and dominate your enemies in both single and multiplayer.

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:07.000
There it is.

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:08.000
Coming soon.

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:10.000
Multidongs.

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:19.000
You can give us a call if you want to talk about DONGs, or Vijay, or maybe something else going on in gaming this week would be great too.

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:24.000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, or if you want to do it the old fashioned way, you can do it there too.

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:29.000
Real quick though before I go to the phone, any last minute stories you want to throw in here?

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.000
Yeah, I was going to mention, there's one I missed.

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:36.000
Nintendo is sold at 1.5 million NES Classic Editions, and they are still apologizing for shortages.

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:39.000
Yeah, because I still can't get one. What the hell, man?

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:40.000
That's lame.

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:46.000
And then also, some weird person is lining up already at the Nintendo World Store in New York for the Nintendo Switch.

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:55.000
Can we, like, I understand that people are fanboys about this shit, but can we, like, please draw the line somewhere where lining up a month before it comes out is a little fucking stupid?

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:58.000
I mean, come on. I get it. You want to be first in line.

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
But that's fucking dumb.

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:04.000
That's like, oh, I'm going to go line up for Half-Life right now.

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:07.000
At what point do you become a line wayer to, like, homeless?

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:12.000
How is that person getting money? I mean, if they saved the monies, they could take a month off to do it. Good on them.

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:21.000
How are they staying in line for that long? Because if they're the only one in line, because there's not people who are going to be crazy enough to do that, then who's watching their spot when they have to go to the bathroom or eat or something?

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
Or just pissing on the street, I guess.

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
Are there two of them in line right now?

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000
I think it's him and Triforce.

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000
So they probably are looking out for each other.

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
Probably one of those.

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:32.000
Still stupid.

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:38.000
And Stoppy says he's a pro YouTuber. That's where the money's coming from. Watching him on YouTube.

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
Oh, good.

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
How about that?

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:55.000
Well, I did find something neat today, and I don't want to give Walmart any business, but I had to get it there because it's the only place that has them. Our little LCD monitor arcade games.

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000
I kind of want one now that you showed me.

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:58.000
They're 20 bucks.

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
I'm kind of fucking pissed off you showed me those.

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:04.000
I almost asked you if you wanted me to grab you one.

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:12.000
Kind of, yeah, but they're full games. With the screen, they're like yay big, which is great. Maybe a foot tall?

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:20.000
LCD screens are fucking cheap now. You can get one of those Atari Flashback consoles, but it's actually a portable gaming thing that looks like a Lynx or something, I don't know.

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:21.000
Something like that.

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:26.000
But even smaller. Maybe like a Game Boy Mini. You can get one of those that's an Atari Flashback for like 50 bucks.

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:29.000
Like, LCD screens, I guess technology's getting really cheap.

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:42.000
It's supposed to be like a four-part thing, and we got the ones that we were really interested in. We wanted the Qbert, so we got Qbert, although I think it's one of the home-immulated versions or something like that.

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:49.000
And Centipede, although I agree with Dan, it's kind of lame. It doesn't have a trackball on it instead. If it had a trackball, it would have been perfect.

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:56.000
But I mean, it's got the cabinet art and everything. They're just really cool little things.

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
I kind of want one.

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
Well, I'll tell you-

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
Alan's gonna be mad when I bring more shit in this house.

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:07.000
I'll tell you the one fucking Walmart in town I found a mat, and they only had one of each left when I left.

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:10.000
And that was the one up South What?

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
Oh, the what? The Middle of Nowhere one?

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:13.000
The new one, yeah.

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:17.000
The one that's like in- I don't know why they built a Walmart there, because there's nothing out there.

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000
There's like some neighborhoods over there.

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.000
Crazy. I wonder, you could probably still go into Walmart.com-

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:23.000
No, you can't order them online.

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.000
You can't do the whole pick up and store? That whole thing?

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:26.000
They don't let you order them online.

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:27.000
What?

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:28.000
That's ridiculous.

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:31.000
I'm heading back up that way if you want me to grab you a couple.

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000
Yeah, maybe, maybe. I might have to think about that.

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:38.000
Alright, let's get to the calls, though, over at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:39.000
We do have a call coming in. Let's get to it.

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.000
It's Rayginator.

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
Hey, Rayginator. How you doing?

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:50.000
Pretty good. Just having a little fun trolling on Twitter right now.

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:53.000
What are you trolling on Twitter, Rayginator?

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000
The so-called president.

02:04:56.000 --> 02:05:01.000
Or as I like to call him, the Oompa Loompa and crazy.

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:05.000
Is this what's happening in 2017? It's like BRB, I gotta go cyberbully the president.

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:12.000
Okay, wait. There's a whole actual movement behind it because he's such a narcissist and so self-centered

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:17.000
that the whole point is to completely destabilize him until he's forced to resign

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:24.000
or has an episode that makes him, oh crap, what was it? It was for invoking the 25th Amendment.

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:31.000
Fascinating. This year's harvest will be quite bountiful. Anyway, what's on your mind, Rayginator?

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:41.000
Well, I was thinking, sorry to get a little tongue-tied.

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:53.000
One thing I've been wondering is has there been any games that you bought over God knows how long

02:05:53.000 --> 02:06:02.000
before you bought it, you think, oh yeah, this game is going to be great.

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:08.000
You go out, buy it, and then as soon as you get it home and play it, you think, oh my God, what the hell,

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:11.000
dad, waste my money on this. This is a total piece of shit.

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:16.000
Yes. There's a game, and the first thing that jumps to mind, and I was so mad about this,

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:20.000
there was a game on the Xbox 360 called Fusion Frenzy 2.

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:25.000
And the original Fusion Frenzy was an okay game, which was kind of like a rip-off of Mario Party of sorts,

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:31.000
but you know, hey, I'm all for Mario Party clones. That one on the 360 was such hot fucking garbage,

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:38.000
I was actually angry that I bought it. I was like, why did I give this company my money? I was mad.

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:43.000
So that would be me. What about you guys? Have you ever made a purchase, you get home, you play it,

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:49.000
and you're like, I am mad. I rented a game once. It's not the same thing. But it was so bad.

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:53.000
You wanted your $3 rental back. No, get this. We took it back to Blockbuster.

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:59.000
And we said, this game is bad. It was like WCW, Thunder, WWF, Thunder, some wrestling game.

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:04.000
Dan and I were really into wrestling games. And we took it back. Were? Well, were, yeah.

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:10.000
I'm not so much into them. But we took the game back and said, this was really, really bad.

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:17.000
Can we get something different? And so they're like, okay. And that works?

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:22.000
Wow. Okay. All right. Cool.

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:27.000
Yeah. Unfortunately, Jamie just triggered a really bad memory of mine.

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:35.000
Unfortunately, I was stupid enough to get that Thunder game used from Blockbuster.

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:46.000
Regretted it to this day. And I also picked up more combat on the Super Nintendo.

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:53.000
That wasn't as bad as Thunder, but still pretty damn bad, though.

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:59.000
I mean, it was basically bleached or sanitized.

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:06.000
They took all the fun out of Mortal Kombat when they released it on the Super Nintendo.

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:11.000
So, Super Nintendo Mortal Kombat with the sweat, you just weren't having it.

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:25.000
Exactly. At least in the arcade, what differentiated Mortal Kombat from, say, well, the biggest competitor at the time was Street Fighter.

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:34.000
Mortal Kombat was supposed to be over top, really gory, with all the fatalities and the blood and all that.

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:40.000
Decapitation is why people played Mortal Kombat. Having grown up in that era,

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:45.000
and I remember distinctly going to a place like Nickel Mania, the all-nickel arcade,

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:49.000
and playing things like Street Fighter II and Mortal Kombat, that was the reason why people played Mortal Kombat.

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:54.000
They wanted to do the fatalities. And it was cool or funny or whatever.

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:59.000
They got more cartoony in part two, so it started to kind of get borderline camp.

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:04.000
So it's like Street Fighter was kind of like your serious fighting game, and then Mortal Kombat was kind of your camp.

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:09.000
And I realize that there's some hardcore Mortal Kombat fans that probably wouldn't appreciate me calling me that,

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:12.000
but honestly, it was part of the reason of its success in the beginning.

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:17.000
And I think it was supposed to be camp. Look at a character like Johnny Cage and tell me that's not fucking camp.

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:21.000
I wouldn't necessarily say it was campy.

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:34.000
Now, I think my more... Now, this is just my interpretation, but I think Mortal Kombat set out to be, for lack of a better term, edgy.

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:46.000
I kind of equate it to those 70s-style pulp action movies, the gory ones, stuff like that.

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:57.000
They kind of went for the edgy, the shocking value, because as far as I know, unless I'm wrong here,

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:14.000
Mortal Kombat was one of the first games that had the over-the-top gore and blood and all that.

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:22.000
Well, it had the graphics to be able to really do something like that, because technically, okay, maybe it wasn't like over-the-top gore,

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:30.000
but there were Atari 2600 games that were very controversial because of the crazy over-the-top stuff that they were showing.

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000
Custer's Revenge?

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:35.000
Yeah, of course, things like that. Beat Em and Eat Em and things like that.

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:45.000
So, of course, I still say to this day, video games are art, and wherever there is art, people are going to push art to offensive territories,

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:53.000
such as what you saw in those Atari 2600 games, because especially a game like Custer's Revenge is kind of pretty fucking offensive if you think about it.

02:10:53.000 --> 02:11:05.000
And I think Mortal Kombat, in a way, was art that was intended to shock and offend, with the whole decapitations and the over-the-top fatalities.

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:10.000
Like a good old John Waters movie where Divine eats poop at the end of it.

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:19.000
That was set up to shock and offend and get people to talk about it and have other people pay money to go see the movie, because they couldn't believe that it actually happened.

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:31.000
So, I mean, Mortal Kombat just had the luxury, or whatever you want to call it, of they had the photorealism was coming out around that time.

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:44.000
The whole capturing the sprite from photos, that was kind of a thing that was catching on more and more, and so they were able to make a photorealistic type of camp game like that, and that's where Mortal Kombat was really one of the first.

02:11:44.000 --> 02:12:00.000
But there were certainly other camp around the same time. Night Trap would be another great example of controversial camp that was definitely put out there to just be shocking and sell that way.

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:09.000
Let me ask this though, Loki. I didn't want to skip you. Was there ever a game that you bought or anything that was so fucking bad you were mad about it?

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:22.000
I can't think of anything. I'm usually pretty careful about what I bought. I can't think of anything that I was really angry about.

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:32.000
DungeonBuster in chat says, to me, at the time, Mortal Kombat seemed like an extreme version of Pit Fighter. It seemed like a playable version of Pit Fighter. Pit Fighter was a real garbage game, in my opinion.

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:44.000
I mean, Pit Fighter was just one of those things where it was, oh cool, it's photorealistic things, but that's about where it ends, because Pit Fighter is kind of a garbage game, in my opinion. Especially the Super Nintendo version. Jesus.

02:12:44.000 --> 02:13:07.000
The thing is, going way back in the day, when my parents were in bowling leagues and they dragged my siblings and I along, just rolling around the place while they bowled, the bowling alley did have a Pit Fighter game there for a while.

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:26.000
And while it wasn't necessarily my favorite game, it was kind of sort of playable, but it was at least interesting for its time, but like you said, the Super Nintendo version was horrible though.

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:40.000
If you had to play Pit Fighter, if only for its place in gaming history, just go with the arcade version. Skip the Super Nintendo.

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:46.000
Alright, well, Ray Jainer, I'm going to let you go to try to get some more calls, but thank you for the question.

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000
Yep, sure, have a good one.

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:49.000
See ya, bye bye.

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:54.000
Alright, OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype if you want to try and get through here before we wrap things up.

02:13:54.000 --> 02:14:01.000
Let's see, DungeonBuster in chat says, Pit Fighter was so clunky. Yeah, that was a big problem with it. It was so clunky, it was like unplayable.

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:10.000
Like sometimes, god, bad control schemes. Haven't you ever played a game where you're like, did they even bother to play this themselves to see if this was any fun at all?

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:18.000
Like, did anyone actually play this to see if it was a good game? Because if anybody had actually played this, they would have seen, this is garbage.

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:22.000
Bomberman Act Zero, there's another great example.

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
How did that pass QA? I don't know.

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:29.000
It just didn't care. It didn't have bugs in it, let's put it out.

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:31.000
Clearly. Well, I don't know if it did.

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:35.000
That's a story for Flocko, I would think. Did he work around that time?

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:40.000
No, I don't think so. I don't think any of them were there at that time.

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:43.000
Not any of our pals.

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:47.000
Alright, I'm gonna do one last call for calls. OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype.

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000
Oop, I do see it lighting up, so let's get to it.

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:53.000
We'll get another call in right now. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:55.000
Hey, it's Stoppy, how are you guys doing?

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:57.000
Hey good, Stoppy, what's up buddy?

02:14:57.000 --> 02:15:01.000
Not much, not much. I went to PAX South last weekend, I tried out the Switch.

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.000
Oh my gosh, I wanna hear all about it.

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:06.000
So, well first off, before we get to the Switch, how is PAX South?

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:12.000
I've been harsh on PAX ever since my last one that I went to, but what was your take on PAX?

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:19.000
I loved it. I've been to the past two ones, so basically all the ones at PAX South.

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:22.000
I also went to PAX East like a few years ago.

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:25.000
But yeah, I just have more fun every time I go.

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:28.000
Just as long as you stick to the indie booths, then it's really good.

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:34.000
But otherwise you could stay in line for a really long time if you're trying to chase the AAA stuff.

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
But yeah, panels are good too.

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:39.000
So you did though chase down the Switch, because that's what you wanna talk about.

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:40.000
I did.

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
How long did you wait for that?

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:49.000
I got there on Friday, because I figured Friday was the best day to get the shortest line, so I got there early.

02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:55.000
The doors opened at 10, and I got there at 8 so that I could wait in line.

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:59.000
But even getting there at 8, I did not get into the first line, the first queue.

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:05.000
So I was in the second one, and once they let the first queue go, they all just b-lined to the Switch.

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:07.000
And same with the second that I was in.

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:12.000
But yeah, once I got there, I just got into whatever line I could find.

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:16.000
And I ended up waiting almost 3 hours to play the Switch.

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000
Wow. Yeah, see.

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:22.000
Wow. Okay, so you made the wait, and how was the Switch?

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:25.000
What did you play, and how did that experience go?

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:30.000
The line that I ended up in, again, I just got into whichever line I could.

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:33.000
Just like, okay, I just gotta get in now before it gets longer.

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:36.000
The line that I got into was Breath of the Wild, so that's the one that I played.

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:41.000
And they had a line for Breath of the Wild, and then another one for a little lounge where you got to try all the other games.

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:44.000
And I didn't get a chance to do that one, though.

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:48.000
Okay, but how was Breath of the Wild? So how was your experience with the Switch?

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:53.000
It was really good. I do think that it's going to be a success.

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:59.000
And Breath of the Wild, it was a good game. I'm not a big Zelda fan, though.

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:08.000
So that's kind of a good thing and a bad thing, because I guess you could take it from a non-Zelda fan that I really liked it.

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:12.000
So that should be a really good recommendation for Breath of the Wild, because I usually don't play Zelda games.

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:18.000
But this one was really, really good, so that is going to be a killer app for the Switch, I guarantee you.

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:22.000
It's just a really, really good game to pick up and play.

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:28.000
It kind of reminded me of Ico and Shadow of the Colossus, in the way that you move the character.

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:33.000
It didn't feel like past Zeldas, at least from the little bits of Zeldas that I've played in the past.

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:40.000
Now, were you playing it on the Switch as a portable system, or were you playing with a pro controller on the TV? How did that work?

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:50.000
Both. Because when you got to the Switch booth, well, when they put you on your console, it was already docked.

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:58.000
Then it had the little Joy-Cons and the grip thing. So I played it initially right there hooked up to the TV.

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:03.000
And then halfway through the demo, the guy working the booth, he goes up to you and he's like,

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:07.000
Hey, if you want to, you can take it out and then put it in portable mode. So I tried it both ways.

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:14.000
And I have to say that I agree 100% with you that it is intended to be a portable device.

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:21.000
When it was hooked up to the TV, I'm not a big graphics snob, I like playing older games.

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:26.000
But I could tell that there was a lot of pixelation around the characters. Very, very noticeable.

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:39.000
So that's going to be a problem with it, I think. It's just not meant to display on a 1080p TV.

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:48.000
So you could tell that there's a lot of pixelation going. Also, the textures for rocks and grass and that sort of thing,

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:53.000
it can be pretty muddy even if you're up close to it. It's still like a very muddy texture.

02:18:53.000 --> 02:19:01.000
So I don't know, I'm the type that I don't really like the textures on 3DS. So maybe some Nintendo fans aren't going to mind it.

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:05.000
But for me it was very noticeable and it just took out like a sore thumb.

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:10.000
But when you're in portable mode, it seems that it's more tuned up to the portable screen.

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:16.000
Because on the portable screen it was very impressive. It was just amazing. The screen quality was great on the portable.

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:25.000
Very interesting. I like the affirmation that I might be on to something with my whole thinking as a portable system.

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:33.000
How do those controllers feel? Because they look a little small, but did it feel good playing with the Joy-Cons?

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:41.000
They're smaller than you think they are. When you get it, you're going to be really freaked out that they're just so small.

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:47.000
You can basically pick it up with one hand and it will just fit within your five fingers.

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:50.000
Well, it's not the size, it's how you use it.

02:19:50.000 --> 02:20:02.000
Exactly, exactly. One of the things I was concerned with was that I didn't like that the controls...

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:06.000
Nintendo is the only one doing it with the controls that are parallel.

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:12.000
Where you have an analog stick sitting right underneath the face buttons.

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:16.000
So that's something that really concerned me because that's not how thumbs work.

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:19.000
It's not going to feel right when you're controlling it.

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:22.000
But I was pleasantly surprised. It actually feels really good.

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:29.000
I was worried that if you press B that it's going to press the right analog stick, but it didn't do that at all.

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:39.000
It seems that, at least when I was holding it, when I was pressing B, it seems that that little nook in your thumb,

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:46.000
like when you have your thumb kind of arched, that's kind of like where the analog stick falls under.

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:51.000
So it's kind of weird to explain it, but it doesn't get in the way the way that they've designed it.

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:57.000
I don't know if that was intentional or if people with bigger hands, bigger fingers are going to have a problem with that.

02:20:57.000 --> 02:21:01.000
But for me it just felt comfortable, so that was very reassuring.

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:06.000
But the D-pad is terrible. It's awful, just like we suspected it would be.

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:11.000
So that's going to be a problem, but the way that I see it, we're kind of in a post-D-pad world.

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:16.000
There's not a lot of games that strictly use the D-pad, so I don't think it's going to hold down the hardware.

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:23.000
But it is something that if you have a retro game or a game on the eShop or whatever virtual console,

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:28.000
you're not going to want to play it with a Switch controller, at least not the one that comes out of the box with it.

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:33.000
Yeah, that's right. They've had that with the one that they've shown already in the patent stuff,

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:37.000
where it's going to have an actual classic D-pad on it.

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:38.000
Exactly, exactly.

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000
It's a separate thing for 40 bucks.

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:45.000
Oh, boy. Or the $70 Joy-Con or something like that. I'm sorry, not Joy-Con, Pro Controller.

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:47.000
Definitely, definitely.

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:54.000
Oh, boy. All right, well, anything else from PAX South we should know about? Thank you, though, for the rundown on the Switch.

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:59.000
I'm looking forward to getting one in my hands, even if it is a little small. I can't wait to work with it.

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:06.000
Yeah, I think you're going to like it, and I think Lucky did make a mistake when he canceled his pre-order.

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:13.000
It's going to be big, and like I said, Zelda is going to be a killer app, so it convinced me, and I'm not a Zelda fan.

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:16.000
I think he's going to regret that cancellation right there.

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:17.000
Yeah, but do you have a Wii U?

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:24.000
Another thing for Lucky, a PSVR. Try out a game that's going to come out called Static. It is amazing.

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:27.000
I tried that over at PAX South, too, and it's absolutely amazing.

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:29.000
I'll have to check it out. Do you have a Wii U?

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:35.000
No, I don't. I'm not a big fan of Nintendo hardware. I'm not even going to get the Switch at launch,

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:40.000
so I'm really going to wait for another iteration of the console, because, like you said, with the D-pad,

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:47.000
I just don't think that it's the best iteration of the hardware right now, and as I see it,

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:52.000
every portable Nintendo console that succeeded has always had a second iteration that was better,

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:54.000
so I'm just waiting for that instead.

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:55.000
Okay.

02:22:55.000 --> 02:23:02.000
All right. Well, Stoppy, thank you so much for the rundown on PAX South. I appreciate it, and we'll check in with you again

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:06.000
once you do pick up a Switch and get converted to Zelda fandom.

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:09.000
Of course. All right, catch you later. Thanks.

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:11.000
Take care. Yep. Bye.

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:15.000
All right. What to do? I didn't see anybody else trying to ring through the line,

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:22.000
but I will keep it open for just a hot minute at Orange Launch Radio on Skype if you want to give us a call.

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:26.000
Loki, do you think you will end up regretting that?

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:30.000
No, I'm not going to regret it, because there's nothing out except for Zelda at launch.

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:36.000
Like I said, I can't justify buying a system for $400 for one game that I have a system already

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:40.000
that I can play that game on, so I will pick it up when it comes out on the Wii U.

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:52.000
So, I don't know. I'm checking out this really cool animated gif right now of someone playing a version of Portal on HoloLens in Augmented Reality.

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.000
Oh, cool. I liked HoloLens.

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:58.000
That looks fucking sweet. I know it's like a little...

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:02.000
It's like you're playing it in the real world, so they're launching portals against walls in their own house,

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:09.000
or like office building. It looks like it's an office building, and throwing a companion cube through it, and it's interacting with the environment.

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:12.000
Okay, that's pretty rad. That's pretty rad.

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:19.000
I liked the time I got to spend with HoloLens when Bobby brought his dev thingy over to DragonCon.

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:20.000
I'll swing this around.

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:24.000
I'd like to see what it's going to look like a year later, for sure.

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:28.000
Okay, so this is a little bit of what it looks like.

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:32.000
Oh, that's really cool. Oh, you can actually just put the portals anywhere in the room.

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:36.000
It must be one of those things that must scan the room to look for the walls and all that stuff first.

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:39.000
That's really cool. I like that.

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000
Yeah, because this is a radio show.

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:42.000
I'll post it in chat.

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:48.000
You guys can't see it, even for those listening on the podcast feed, because with the football game today, I'm sure a lot of people are listening on the podcast feed.

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:57.000
It's like they are putting the portals on actual walls in this stairwell, in this living room, and so forth, which is what the HoloLens kind of does.

02:24:57.000 --> 02:25:02.000
It scans the room and turns the room into a playground or something like that.

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:09.000
Anyhow, that's it. No other calls are coming in on Skype, so I think we are going to wrap it up tonight.

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:16.000
Things have been a little bit quieter around here with the football game going on, so that's it.

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:18.000
I think we're going to wrap up right there.

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:25.000
Let's go around, and first, let me thank everybody for being here, tuning in live over at Orange Lounge Radio.

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:32.000
If you like what you heard here at the show, please leave us a nice five-star review on iTunes or wherever you found this show.

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:33.000
That goes a long way.

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:37.000
Tell a friend or two about the show, because word of mouth is all we got.

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:47.000
We don't have a big million-dollar website behind us or anything like that, so we really appreciate all the kind referrals and so forth.

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:52.000
Otherwise, I think we're about done, so let's get to everybody's final thought.

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:54.000
Loki, we'll start with you, your final thought tonight.

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:58.000
The next six weeks are going to be pretty exciting. Can't talk about it, though, but it's going to be exciting.

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:02.000
You're just going to talk about it in vague terms.

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:12.000
I haven't yet signed an NDA, but I'm going to have to soon, so once I actually start working on stuff, but it'll be exciting.

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:19.000
And fortunately, I can't really talk about it, because that also unveils what my actual profession is.

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:23.000
Don't forget, Palmer Luck, he just had to pay $500 million for that whole thing.

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:26.000
Okay, well that's not compete stuff.

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:28.000
That has nothing to do with it, but yeah.

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:29.000
Alright, alright, alright.

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:32.000
Dark Saga, your final thought tonight.

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:34.000
Resist.

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:42.000
And my final thought tonight is, now I'm thinking about arcade cabinets in this house.

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:48.000
Not even just the $20 things that Dark Saga was talking about, but I know there's that.

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:50.000
There is an arcade cabinet.

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:57.000
And that's really cool, don't get me wrong, but I'm talking about a full-on burger time machine or something.

02:26:57.000 --> 02:27:03.000
I don't have many regrets in life, but letting that burger time machine go when I saw it at the auction, it's one of my few regrets in life.

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:05.000
We might have a line on another baby Pac-Man.

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:08.000
Really? Wait, do you have a baby Pac-Man already?

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:09.000
No.

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:14.000
We're trying to get one. I'm hoping, but they're kind of pricey.

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:17.000
Fingers crossed. Toes crossed, too.

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:23.000
That's it. Have a good night. We will see you next time in seven days to talk about next week's news. Until then, bye.

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:49.000
See you next week.

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:19.000
See you next week.
