where every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.760 --> 00:34.760
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:34.760 --> 00:39.760
where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight on the February

00:39.760 --> 00:46.760
of 26th, 2017 with episode number 677 of our program. My name is Rob Roberts joining you

00:46.760 --> 00:52.760
live here at the Voice Geeks Network, vognetwork.com where we tape every Sunday, we tape live

00:52.760 --> 00:57.760
Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

00:57.760 --> 01:02.760
and we are here to talk about video games and gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle too

01:02.760 --> 01:06.760
with me here in studio, welcome back DarkSakura, Jamie Summers

01:06.760 --> 01:07.760
Why hello there

01:07.760 --> 01:08.760
Hi how are you doing?

01:08.760 --> 01:09.760
Better than last week

01:09.760 --> 01:14.760
Yeah you don't sound so great but at least you look good

01:14.760 --> 01:15.760
Well of course I look good

01:15.760 --> 01:17.760
I always look good, I woke up like this

01:17.760 --> 01:18.760
Girl

01:18.760 --> 01:23.760
I gotta say also a big thank you and hugs and kisses to DarkSakura because this was

01:23.760 --> 01:28.760
something she ran and picked up for me after the show two weeks ago when she was here because

01:28.760 --> 01:33.760
she'd spotted them. This is like a Walmart exclusive which I don't set foot in Walmarts ever

01:33.760 --> 01:38.760
If I could have helped it but I went and looked for him for Dan because he had been all hyper

01:38.760 --> 01:40.760
We went to like three different fucking Walmarts looking for him

01:40.760 --> 01:45.760
So what these are and if I do go to a Walmart, I go to the Walmart that they built here

01:45.760 --> 01:50.760
We broadcast live in Sacramento, California and there is a Walmart in the middle of nowhere

01:50.760 --> 01:55.760
Like literally in the back roads, like you're going to go to Elk Grove on the back roads for those that are local

01:55.760 --> 02:01.760
Like there's literally a Walmart in the middle of nowhere, like I don't know who goes there but there's a Walmart there

02:01.760 --> 02:05.760
And sure enough the Walmart in the middle of nowhere had the little arcade classic

02:05.760 --> 02:08.760
You know all those little neighborhoods popped up around that area of Elk Grove

02:08.760 --> 02:14.760
I think it's more built for the future because you know down here by, I don't want to give away where I live on the show

02:14.760 --> 02:17.760
There's developments coming up nearby here too, anyway

02:17.760 --> 02:21.760
So I was going to say these arcade classics, so this is pretty cool

02:21.760 --> 02:26.760
So they're like little tiny cabinets, like arcade cabinets, like tiny arcade cabinets

02:26.760 --> 02:28.760
I'm talking like the size of like a wallet

02:28.760 --> 02:29.760
They're maybe what, eight inches high?

02:29.760 --> 02:33.760
Yeah, yeah, they're not that big but they actually like they have a game inside them

02:33.760 --> 02:35.760
So this one is what, this one's Qbert right?

02:35.760 --> 02:38.760
Yeah, which I honestly think it might be the Colecovision version

02:38.760 --> 02:40.760
It might be, they definitely look like old school computer versions

02:41.760 --> 02:43.760
And then this one is Centipede actually

02:43.760 --> 02:45.760
So I can actually, I can fire up the little demo

02:45.760 --> 02:48.760
I don't know if you guys will be able to hear this okay, but you might be able to hear the little

02:48.760 --> 02:49.760
Let's try

02:52.760 --> 02:53.760
I don't know if they can hear that at all

02:53.760 --> 02:55.760
But you can hear like the little background noises if I try to fire

02:55.760 --> 02:56.760
Well I can hear it across the room

02:58.760 --> 03:01.760
Maybe, it's very very quiet probably, sorry it doesn't come through very well

03:01.760 --> 03:07.760
But yeah, and they're cute, they're like the screens on them are very tiny obviously

03:07.760 --> 03:12.760
But this is something that I've seen like it seems to be a trend in the whole retro gaming thing

03:12.760 --> 03:16.760
Because I guess this technology to make these little screen games is really cheap

03:16.760 --> 03:21.760
Because I've seen now Atari flashbacks are coming on things that look like that

03:21.760 --> 03:25.760
Where it's like a Game Boy micro or something, you remember that? The little micros?

03:25.760 --> 03:27.760
I have a Game Boy micro

03:27.760 --> 03:28.760
I know, they're a little bigger

03:28.760 --> 03:29.760
Remember you used to carry it to E3 every year

03:29.760 --> 03:32.760
I do, I do, but the screens are maybe a little bigger than that

03:32.760 --> 03:35.760
Do you know that got me into a Nintendo thing once?

03:35.760 --> 03:36.760
Did it really?

03:36.760 --> 03:37.760
Yeah

03:37.760 --> 03:38.760
No, I forgot about that

03:38.760 --> 03:40.760
It was I think the last year that we went

03:40.760 --> 03:44.760
Because the last year we went I had a media thing, it was the year before that

03:44.760 --> 03:47.760
When I was like, someone's like, is that a Game Boy micro?

03:47.760 --> 03:48.760
Yeah

03:48.760 --> 03:49.760
You wanna come see this?

03:49.760 --> 03:51.760
Sure

03:51.760 --> 03:55.760
Hey Ashley since you weren't here last week, I don't even know if you heard this news

03:55.760 --> 03:57.760
Did you hear about E3 opening up to the public?

03:57.760 --> 03:58.760
Yeah, I knew about it

03:58.760 --> 04:00.760
I was here when we talked about it the week before that

04:00.760 --> 04:02.760
Oh that's right, last week was the follow up, sorry

04:02.760 --> 04:05.760
Everything's a blur in gaming news you guys, sorry about that

04:05.760 --> 04:08.760
So last week was the follow up that they hadn't sold out the tickets still

04:08.760 --> 04:13.760
So not something you jumped on or are going to be going to

04:13.760 --> 04:16.760
Good point, I'm kinda done with E3

04:16.760 --> 04:17.760
Yeah

04:17.760 --> 04:18.760
I mean it was fun

04:18.760 --> 04:21.760
Stories like that I doubt are gonna happen anymore

04:21.760 --> 04:25.760
If they do and we're wrong, awesome, we'll try to go next year

04:25.760 --> 04:27.760
You know, but I just, you know, maybe

04:27.760 --> 04:31.760
I'm still wanting to go to, I wanna go to a real convention

04:31.760 --> 04:32.760
No

04:32.760 --> 04:34.760
Since we're not having gamer X this year apparently

04:34.760 --> 04:37.760
No, sad, well there's MagWest, that's probably the contender out here

04:37.760 --> 04:40.760
I love MagFest though, and you know what really cracked me up?

04:40.760 --> 04:41.760
I'm gonna go to DragCon

04:41.760 --> 04:44.760
So I know you don't wanna talk politics on the show, but I'm just gonna mention

04:44.760 --> 04:46.760
Me not wanna talk politics

04:46.760 --> 04:52.760
But it was in the news that the guy who happens to reside in the White House right now

04:52.760 --> 04:55.760
Was speaking at an event, right, did this whole speech thing

04:55.760 --> 05:00.760
And the whole thing with that, that thing, he was in National Harbor, Maryland

05:00.760 --> 05:03.760
He was at the exact same hotel where MagFest is at, that whole thing

05:03.760 --> 05:05.760
Was at the same hotel where MagFest is at

05:05.760 --> 05:10.760
So it kinda cracked me up knowing that, you know, the president saying whatever he's saying

05:10.760 --> 05:13.760
I wasn't listening, on that stage, and I'm like

05:13.760 --> 05:17.760
Gosh, that's where like, all these bands were playing

05:17.760 --> 05:21.760
Like Bit Brigade was playing like just four weeks ago

05:21.760 --> 05:23.760
I have to say something to Bob Coffee

05:23.760 --> 05:24.760
Yeah

05:24.760 --> 05:26.760
I'm not going to Anime Expo ever again

05:26.760 --> 05:27.760
You've been before

05:27.760 --> 05:31.760
I used to go, I went like five years in a row and cosplayed every time

05:31.760 --> 05:33.760
My first AX was amazing

05:33.760 --> 05:38.760
And then I went to the one at Disneyland Hotel where we had the DDR third mix

05:38.760 --> 05:41.760
I was gonna say, you got hooked into DDR thanks to Anime Expo, right?

05:41.760 --> 05:44.760
I played DDR and Combat Boots in 1999

05:44.760 --> 05:50.760
It just got to be way too overly commercialized

05:50.760 --> 05:53.760
I mean, Anime now is super commercialized anyway

05:53.760 --> 05:56.760
But it wasn't quite the same thing where you'd go and you'd find

05:56.760 --> 05:59.760
Like the people selling the Japanese laser discs or, you know

05:59.760 --> 06:02.760
All of the, you know, real import stuff

06:02.760 --> 06:06.760
Or the Avextrax CDs because I loaded up on Avextrax CDs

06:06.760 --> 06:09.760
And it's just not what it was

06:09.760 --> 06:12.760
And I broke a wing my last year at AX

06:12.760 --> 06:15.760
Because that was my Angel Sanctuary cosplay

06:15.760 --> 06:17.760
So, I'm kinda done

06:17.760 --> 06:19.760
Fanime is a little bit better

06:19.760 --> 06:21.760
But I haven't been to Fanime in a while

06:22.760 --> 06:24.760
When was the last convention you went to?

06:24.760 --> 06:25.760
GameRx

06:25.760 --> 06:26.760
Oh yeah, GameRx, of course

06:26.760 --> 06:28.760
You haven't gone to a lot though

06:28.760 --> 06:29.760
No, not really

06:29.760 --> 06:32.760
I hadn't even cosplayed this year because I was so mad at the cosplay contest

06:32.760 --> 06:37.760
But I'm hoping I can make it to the convention I've been working on

06:37.760 --> 06:41.760
All of their material for since it just started DerpyCon

06:41.760 --> 06:45.760
One of these days I'd like to actually visit the convention I've been doing the guidebook for every year

06:45.760 --> 06:47.760
That's New Jersey?

06:47.760 --> 06:48.760
Yeah

06:48.760 --> 06:50.760
I think Rama would love to have you out there

06:50.760 --> 06:51.760
I'd like to

06:51.760 --> 06:53.760
Shoot, I just want to go to New York really

06:53.760 --> 06:55.760
Send me to New York somebody

06:55.760 --> 06:57.760
All of y'all on the East Coast

06:57.760 --> 07:00.760
Maybe get 50 bucks a person and y'all can fly me out

07:00.760 --> 07:02.760
Start your GoFundMe

07:02.760 --> 07:04.760
This is my Kickstarter

07:04.760 --> 07:05.760
Alright, anyway

07:05.760 --> 07:06.760
Bask in my presence

07:06.760 --> 07:07.760
I hate to ignore

07:07.760 --> 07:09.760
We had to catch up with Jamie though since she was out last week

07:09.760 --> 07:11.760
But I hate to ignore her over there of course here in studio as always

07:11.760 --> 07:12.760
Techmaster Loki

07:12.760 --> 07:13.760
Hello

07:13.760 --> 07:14.760
Hi Loki, how are you?

07:14.760 --> 07:15.760
Fine

07:15.760 --> 07:17.760
What do you think of these little arcade thingies?

07:17.760 --> 07:20.760
Are these, is this the sort of thing that interests you or are you like, nah it's cheap?

07:20.760 --> 07:22.760
I'd buy one and take one apart

07:24.760 --> 07:26.760
That's a very Loki way of putting things

07:26.760 --> 07:28.760
Actually, well and that was the other thing I didn't mention about these things

07:28.760 --> 07:30.760
These things were only 20 bucks a pop

07:30.760 --> 07:32.760
That's the thing, that technology is like so cheap now

07:32.760 --> 07:35.760
Those Atari flashbacks are what, like 40, 50 bucks?

07:35.760 --> 07:37.760
I don't know, they're not that expensive

07:37.760 --> 07:40.760
And I see these all the time now

07:40.760 --> 07:42.760
I was at the mall yesterday

07:42.760 --> 07:46.760
There's a, what's that new store that's popping up with all the nerdy stuff

07:46.760 --> 07:48.760
BoxLunch, is that what it's called?

07:48.760 --> 07:49.760
Hot Topic?

07:49.760 --> 07:51.760
No, well I think it's the same people that run them

07:51.760 --> 07:52.760
Spencer's?

07:52.760 --> 07:54.760
No, I think it's BoxLunch is what it's called

07:54.760 --> 07:56.760
Spencer's is disgusting now

07:56.760 --> 07:58.760
I don't even think they have that at our mall

07:58.760 --> 08:00.760
Yeah, they have it at Sunrise still

08:00.760 --> 08:01.760
No, there's Spencer's at Sunrise

08:01.760 --> 08:02.760
Who goes there? Anyway

08:02.760 --> 08:03.760
Disgusting people

08:03.760 --> 08:04.760
Apparently I do

08:04.760 --> 08:06.760
But what was I going to say about that whole thing?

08:06.760 --> 08:08.760
Oh, so I was at the BoxLunch

08:08.760 --> 08:12.760
Which sells, they have little sections dedicated to all the nerdom things, right?

08:12.760 --> 08:15.760
There's a little Doctor Who section, there's a little Pokemon section

08:16.760 --> 08:21.760
That's right, they do have one of those places down at the Paladio

08:21.760 --> 08:23.760
They have a BoxLunch there

08:23.760 --> 08:24.760
Oh, do they really? Okay, okay

08:24.760 --> 08:26.760
Or something that is very similar to that

08:26.760 --> 08:28.760
So of course I got a look in the gamer section

08:28.760 --> 08:30.760
Because they have like gamer shirts

08:30.760 --> 08:32.760
And there was of course a lot of Overwatch stuff

08:32.760 --> 08:34.760
But I was like, oh maybe I want a D.Va shirt

08:34.760 --> 08:37.760
And there was a Soldier 76 shirt I took a picture of and sent to Shane

08:37.760 --> 08:40.760
Because he had gray hair at the time because he's in the process of dying it

08:40.760 --> 08:43.760
But they also had, in their whole little gaming section

08:43.760 --> 08:49.760
They had a little like mini, like 100 retro game thing

08:49.760 --> 08:51.760
That was like one of these tiny screens

08:51.760 --> 08:53.760
That was like probably something you'd put on a keychain

08:53.760 --> 08:56.760
That had 100 retro games on it

08:56.760 --> 08:59.760
Except they're all just like, I know they're garbage

08:59.760 --> 09:03.760
Not things you recognize

09:03.760 --> 09:06.760
Like this game looks like Pole Position

09:06.760 --> 09:07.760
But it's not

09:07.760 --> 09:09.760
And you know, they're not

09:09.760 --> 09:10.760
It's Pole Poopsition

09:11.760 --> 09:13.760
Exactly, it's Pole Poopsition

09:13.760 --> 09:15.760
And 99 other games

09:15.760 --> 09:18.760
It's like those old Nintendo carts that are like 250 games in one

09:18.760 --> 09:21.760
Then the joke is, all the games suck

09:21.760 --> 09:23.760
It's like one of those things

09:23.760 --> 09:26.760
But anyway, I saw one of those

09:26.760 --> 09:29.760
And I was like, those were pretty cheap too

09:29.760 --> 09:31.760
So this is like this trend now in retro gaming

09:31.760 --> 09:34.760
Is that the technology is so cheap for these tiny screens

09:34.760 --> 09:37.760
We're probably gonna see even more of it in the coming years

09:37.760 --> 09:38.760
I don't know

09:38.760 --> 09:42.760
I wanna also of course introduce our chatroom over at live.vog.network.com

09:42.760 --> 09:45.760
Again, live on Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific

09:45.760 --> 09:46.760
We read your chat comments

09:46.760 --> 09:48.760
And you can participate along with the show

09:48.760 --> 09:51.760
And sometimes you guys drive what we talk about here on air

09:51.760 --> 09:55.760
I know there's other stuff going on in the entertainment world this evening

09:55.760 --> 09:59.760
But I mean, isn't it pretty clear what's gonna win Best Picture?

09:59.760 --> 10:00.760
No, there's not

10:00.760 --> 10:02.760
About 14 nominees, anyway

10:02.760 --> 10:06.760
So thank you guys for being here even when there's other stuff going on

10:06.760 --> 10:09.760
But Darth Tetsuya is talking about the flashback portable

10:09.760 --> 10:12.760
Kind of looked almost like a PSP or something

10:12.760 --> 10:14.760
But a bunch of Atari classics on it

10:14.760 --> 10:18.760
I think it also supported SD card ROMs

10:18.760 --> 10:22.760
I didn't even realize that if that's the case, that's pretty rad

10:22.760 --> 10:24.760
If you can actually load ROMs on it too

10:24.760 --> 10:28.760
And how big of an SD card do you need for Atari 2600 ROMs?

10:28.760 --> 10:32.760
Last I checked, I mean this was a while back when I downloaded the full ROM

10:32.760 --> 10:35.760
So it was like 6 megs, so it can't be that large

10:35.760 --> 10:37.760
Atari ROMs are like 4 kilobytes

10:37.760 --> 10:42.760
That's what made the programming on that system and the things that they did so fucking impressive

10:42.760 --> 10:45.760
Is that they had no space to work with

10:45.760 --> 10:47.760
With Atari 2600 games

10:47.760 --> 10:50.760
So it's really amazing the stuff that they crammed

10:50.760 --> 10:55.760
I mean, as much of a garbage translation as Pac-Man is versus the arcade

10:55.760 --> 10:58.760
The whole reason why the Pac-Man turned out garbage

10:58.760 --> 11:04.760
Is because Atari wanted it on a 4k ROM cartridge

11:04.760 --> 11:07.760
As opposed to a more expensive 8k cartridge

11:07.760 --> 11:11.760
Which I think when they did Ms. Pac-Man on Atari 2600

11:11.760 --> 11:14.760
Like a couple years later before the big bust and everything

11:14.760 --> 11:16.760
If you ever played Ms. Pac-Man on Atari 2600

11:16.760 --> 11:19.760
It's fine, it's not exactly like the arcade

11:19.760 --> 11:23.760
But it's much more what you would expect an arcade translation to look like on the 2600

11:23.760 --> 11:28.760
But the 4k only ROM on Pac-Man, that's what killed that game

11:28.760 --> 11:31.760
Is that the guy was so limited on what he could work with

11:31.760 --> 11:34.760
It's like, he could only have it

11:34.760 --> 11:36.760
The reason why the ghosts flicker

11:36.760 --> 11:40.760
Is because it could only draw one ghost each frame

11:40.760 --> 11:42.760
It couldn't draw four ghosts

11:42.760 --> 11:44.760
So it draws this ghost, then this ghost

11:44.760 --> 11:46.760
That's okay, it's transparency right?

11:46.760 --> 11:48.760
That's why I always thought it was

11:48.760 --> 11:50.760
It's flickering because they're transparent

11:51.760 --> 11:54.760
Stop Ian Chat says it does support SD cart ROMs

11:54.760 --> 11:56.760
But it's not 100% compatible

11:56.760 --> 11:58.760
Well that's kind of, I didn't even know that

11:58.760 --> 12:00.760
Like I'm learning something here on Tonight's OLR

12:00.760 --> 12:02.760
I had no idea, because that means I could play that homebrew shit

12:02.760 --> 12:04.760
Like Halo for the 2600

12:04.760 --> 12:07.760
Or didn't some guy go in and fix ET?

12:07.760 --> 12:09.760
Yeah they fixed ET

12:09.760 --> 12:10.760
That was the thing we reported on

12:10.760 --> 12:12.760
So you could play Stacks

12:12.760 --> 12:15.760
That game that was part of the Ready Player One contest

12:15.760 --> 12:16.760
Yes, yes

12:16.760 --> 12:19.760
Yes, I don't know why that's so fucking rad

12:19.760 --> 12:21.760
But it is, I don't know

12:22.760 --> 12:23.760
Anyway, let's see

12:23.760 --> 12:26.760
Dark Tetsuya says there's a homebrew version of Pac-Man that's way badder

12:26.760 --> 12:29.760
It was based on the Ms. Pac-Man conversion

12:29.760 --> 12:31.760
Yes, if you've ever played that, it's great

12:31.760 --> 12:33.760
Did he just remove the bow and that's it?

12:34.760 --> 12:37.760
I guess and change the pink to blue or whatever

12:37.760 --> 12:39.760
He had to do to change, yeah probably

12:39.760 --> 12:43.760
Oh thank you, Bobby Blackpool says there was only three ghosts in the Atari 2600 version

12:43.760 --> 12:44.760
I forgot that

12:44.760 --> 12:46.760
I forgot that there was even, they had to downplay the three ghosts

12:46.760 --> 12:47.760
It's hard enough even on that

12:47.760 --> 12:49.760
I know, I know, jeez

12:49.760 --> 12:52.760
I still, I still, even though it was garbage

12:52.760 --> 12:54.760
The thing is, when you're six years old

12:54.760 --> 12:57.760
Which I think is how old I was when I was playing Pac-Man on the 2600

12:57.760 --> 12:58.760
You don't give a fuck

12:58.760 --> 13:00.760
Like you, you just don't, I don't know

13:00.760 --> 13:04.760
Does your six year old care about graphics and accuracy of things?

13:04.760 --> 13:05.760
Yes

13:06.760 --> 13:08.760
Maybe the 80's was just a simpler time

13:08.760 --> 13:10.760
Well they, they will just, but see now they're so

13:10.760 --> 13:12.760
Like they know what Minecraft is

13:12.760 --> 13:14.760
They don't know anything 8 bit or 16 bit

13:14.760 --> 13:16.760
They're like, look daddy, Minecraft

13:17.760 --> 13:19.760
I'm like no, that's just how games look

13:19.760 --> 13:22.760
I'm like, you better be good, I'm gonna make you play the Colecovision over here

13:24.760 --> 13:26.760
Let's see how, you think that's terrible

13:26.760 --> 13:27.760
Well, hold on

13:27.760 --> 13:31.760
Darsakra, how do you view Colecovision gaming as punishment?

13:31.760 --> 13:32.760
I don't

13:33.760 --> 13:35.760
Exactly, but that's the point

13:35.760 --> 13:37.760
Is they play it because they're forced to play it

13:37.760 --> 13:39.760
And then they, they learn to appreciate it

13:39.760 --> 13:40.760
But they won't because

13:40.760 --> 13:43.760
The Colecovision was the best system of its time, seriously

13:43.760 --> 13:46.760
Do you know how many gamer parents I've heard say

13:46.760 --> 13:48.760
I'm gonna raise my kids the right way

13:48.760 --> 13:51.760
And for the first three months that they're gaming

13:51.760 --> 13:54.760
They're not allowed to play anything but Atari 2600 and Colecovision

13:54.760 --> 13:55.760
That's too late, he already has a tablet

13:55.760 --> 13:56.760
Like for example

13:56.760 --> 13:58.760
In the next three months they do Nintendo

13:58.760 --> 13:59.760
Let me just put it this way, okay

13:59.760 --> 14:04.760
Today, alone, today, he must have watched and played

14:05.760 --> 14:08.760
He got up at six o'clock this morning

14:09.760 --> 14:15.760
And watched four hours of Minecraft YouTube videos

14:16.760 --> 14:20.760
He then played another couple hours of Minecraft on the Wii U

14:20.760 --> 14:26.760
Followed by probably what was like another three hours of Minecraft YouTube videos

14:26.760 --> 14:28.760
That's too much Minecraft

14:28.760 --> 14:32.760
Exactly, he doesn't shut the fuck up about Minecraft

14:32.760 --> 14:35.760
All the goddamn time, like dude

14:36.760 --> 14:38.760
I know you like Minecraft

14:38.760 --> 14:39.760
I like Minecraft somewhat

14:39.760 --> 14:42.760
But I don't need to hear Minecraft every fucking second of the game

14:42.760 --> 14:46.760
Just like Daddy, Daddy was the only one that would talk about Minecraft here on OLR for a long time

14:48.760 --> 14:53.760
But I didn't like fill every moment with Minecraft talk

14:54.760 --> 14:57.760
Dark Tetsuya wants to point out about that Pac-Man ROM hack thing

14:57.760 --> 14:59.760
They did redo the mazes

14:59.760 --> 15:02.760
Let's not forget the maze was different in Pac-Man versus Ms. Pac-Man

15:02.760 --> 15:06.760
Ms. Pac-Man had, I don't know if this came over on the 2600 conversion, it's been too long

15:06.760 --> 15:08.760
But I remember the arcade was like four different mazes

15:08.760 --> 15:11.760
As you upgraded through the fruit, you got different mazes

15:11.760 --> 15:14.760
That was the future, Loki, was different mazes

15:14.760 --> 15:16.760
Anyway, let's see

15:16.760 --> 15:21.760
Stoppy in chat pointing out the Coleco Chameleon was punishment

15:21.760 --> 15:23.760
Not the Coleco vision

15:23.760 --> 15:25.760
That's called a scam, I'm sorry

15:25.760 --> 15:27.760
Close, but not quite

15:27.760 --> 15:30.760
SSU100Matt in chat at live.vognetware.com says

15:30.760 --> 15:34.760
Forget going to your room without dessert, play Virtual Boy

15:34.760 --> 15:36.760
Do you want your kid to develop chronic migraines?

15:36.760 --> 15:38.760
Cause the Virtual Boy, that's how you're gonna do it

15:38.760 --> 15:40.760
That is how you're gonna do it

15:40.760 --> 15:43.760
You know it's quite fast, like I watched the Ben Heck tear down of the Virtual Boy

15:43.760 --> 15:45.760
He actually made it better too

15:45.760 --> 15:48.760
But like just learning how that worked, how the whole Virtual Boy thing worked

15:48.760 --> 15:51.760
Was like a spinning mirror and they had just like lights

15:51.760 --> 15:54.760
It literally was like one set of lights blinking on and off

15:54.760 --> 15:57.760
And it just spinning to cover the whole screen

15:57.760 --> 15:59.760
Oh, I always thought it was just one big screen

15:59.760 --> 16:03.760
No, no, it's like lights bouncing off mirrors and shit

16:03.760 --> 16:05.760
It's like, it's crazy

16:05.760 --> 16:08.760
God, no wonder it gave people headaches, that sounds cheap

16:08.760 --> 16:11.760
Alright, anyhow, let's get into tonight's kickoff topic

16:11.760 --> 16:14.760
I wanna talk about a couple things here at the top of the show

16:14.760 --> 16:16.760
Before we get into the rest of the gaming news

16:16.760 --> 16:18.760
But the big thing this week

16:18.760 --> 16:21.760
You know, OLR, we've been around 15 years

16:21.760 --> 16:23.760
When the show first started

16:23.760 --> 16:26.760
We were gaming on mostly the PlayStation 2

16:26.760 --> 16:29.760
And I think the Xbox had just come out

16:29.760 --> 16:33.760
I think we were finally getting Xboxes to play

16:33.760 --> 16:36.760
Dance Dance Revolution Ultra Mix on Xbox

16:36.760 --> 16:38.760
Like that was like back when the show started

16:38.760 --> 16:41.760
When did Ultra Mix come out? Was that like, that wasn't too early in the Xbox

16:41.760 --> 16:44.760
It wasn't too early, I remember when it came out

16:44.760 --> 16:47.760
Because we had that guy that we used to play DDR with

16:47.760 --> 16:49.760
Bring the Xbox over during OLR

16:49.760 --> 16:53.760
That was when you and I lived together at the apartment we had with the pink carpet

16:53.760 --> 16:57.760
Where we had the old webcam that would refresh every 30 seconds

16:57.760 --> 17:00.760
That was when we played Ultra Mix for the first time

17:00.760 --> 17:02.760
That was about the third year of the show probably

17:02.760 --> 17:04.760
So maybe like 2003, 2004

17:04.760 --> 17:07.760
So yeah, that was when that was out, Ultra Mix

17:07.760 --> 17:10.760
But when the show first started it was mainly PlayStation 2

17:10.760 --> 17:15.760
My point is, so we were here when PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 launched

17:15.760 --> 17:18.760
We were here on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One launched

17:18.760 --> 17:22.760
And this week, something that doesn't happen all the time is happening

17:22.760 --> 17:24.760
We have a new console coming out

17:24.760 --> 17:28.760
The Nintendo Switch is finally going to be out this Friday

17:28.760 --> 17:34.760
So we will be living in a world where Nintendo NX is no longer something we speculate about

17:34.760 --> 17:37.760
Over and over again because Nintendo won't say a goddamn thing about it

17:37.760 --> 17:40.760
But we finally will be playing the Switch

17:40.760 --> 17:44.760
And now that the press is getting their hands on the Switch

17:44.760 --> 17:46.760
And more and more people are coming across

17:46.760 --> 17:49.760
Nintendo Switch is out at expo events

17:49.760 --> 17:52.760
I know Nintendo is in San Francisco with their tour

17:52.760 --> 17:58.760
Which, with all respect, I didn't see the point of going to the San Francisco thing when it's out in like six days

17:58.760 --> 18:01.760
I'm like, I'll have it in my living room in six days

18:01.760 --> 18:03.760
So Nintendo Switch is going to be out

18:03.760 --> 18:07.760
And we're finally learning the last few things about the console

18:07.760 --> 18:09.760
Some of our questions getting answered

18:09.760 --> 18:12.760
One of the big whoppers that they dropped on us this week

18:12.760 --> 18:14.760
Virtual console ain't going to be there

18:14.760 --> 18:16.760
No shit, you don't say

18:16.760 --> 18:20.760
Well, now, again, not to inflate my ego too much

18:20.760 --> 18:22.760
I need to be able to fit through the door

18:22.760 --> 18:24.760
But did I not say on last week's show

18:24.760 --> 18:26.760
We need to be prepared, it's not coming

18:26.760 --> 18:28.760
Because they're not talking about it, it's not going to be here

18:28.760 --> 18:30.760
Did I not say that like on last week's show

18:30.760 --> 18:34.760
So, it doesn't mean I wasn't still disappointed in the news

18:34.760 --> 18:36.760
And I gotta say

18:36.760 --> 18:38.760
I really had to kind of like

18:39.760 --> 18:41.760
I don't want to say argue about this

18:41.760 --> 18:43.760
Because arguing over video games is sometimes silly

18:43.760 --> 18:45.760
But I've had to have debates with this

18:45.760 --> 18:47.760
Where I know so many people

18:47.760 --> 18:50.760
That are huge Nintendo fans

18:50.760 --> 18:52.760
Where it's like

18:52.760 --> 18:54.760
If you criticize Nintendo

18:54.760 --> 18:56.760
It's like you attack their religion or something

18:56.760 --> 18:58.760
And it's like, okay, look

18:58.760 --> 19:00.760
I can love video games, I do love video games

19:00.760 --> 19:02.760
And I can love Nintendo, I do love Nintendo

19:02.760 --> 19:04.760
I can still be critical of Nintendo

19:04.760 --> 19:06.760
Question the things you love

19:06.760 --> 19:08.760
Exactly, you can still sit here and go

19:08.760 --> 19:10.760
This is something that should be better

19:10.760 --> 19:12.760
And I do it with all the systems

19:12.760 --> 19:14.760
Sony is not perfect

19:14.760 --> 19:16.760
Microsoft is not perfect

19:16.760 --> 19:18.760
Yes, she doesn't have an Xbox One

19:18.760 --> 19:20.760
You know, Microsoft

19:20.760 --> 19:22.760
And there's things I love about Microsoft

19:22.760 --> 19:24.760
I think the Windows 10 integration is awesome

19:24.760 --> 19:26.760
Personally, but anyway

19:26.760 --> 19:28.760
I think Windows 10 is poop

19:28.760 --> 19:30.760
It is awesome because now I don't have to buy an Xbox One

19:30.760 --> 19:32.760
This isn't about Microsoft

19:32.760 --> 19:34.760
Look, this is about Nintendo

19:34.760 --> 19:36.760
And I think even though I can say I love Nintendo

19:36.760 --> 19:38.760
I do feel like I get disappointed

19:38.760 --> 19:40.760
By Nintendo a lot

19:40.760 --> 19:42.760
Because you feel like there's these things that are like

19:42.760 --> 19:44.760
The low hanging fruit

19:44.760 --> 19:46.760
That's what they call it in the corporate world

19:46.760 --> 19:48.760
The low hanging fruit that you think Nintendo could go for

19:48.760 --> 19:50.760
And they don't

19:50.760 --> 19:52.760
And this has been a battle for forever

19:52.760 --> 19:54.760
It's been the whole online gaming thing

19:54.760 --> 19:56.760
It's been like a low hanging fruit for Nintendo

19:56.760 --> 19:58.760
That they never seem to get

19:58.760 --> 20:00.760
That maybe they're going to get right with the Switch

20:00.760 --> 20:02.760
Now they're going to charge money for it

20:02.760 --> 20:04.760
But we don't know because Nintendo's really

20:04.760 --> 20:06.760
Still not answering a lot of those questions

20:06.760 --> 20:08.760
Although

20:08.760 --> 20:10.760
What? Are we going to find out on Friday?

20:10.760 --> 20:12.760
I guess we're going to have to with the online stuff

20:12.760 --> 20:14.760
Right? Because Bomberman and all that stuff is supposed to be playable online

20:14.760 --> 20:16.760
So we'll start to get some of those answers finally by Friday

20:16.760 --> 20:18.760
But anyway

20:18.760 --> 20:20.760
Virtual Console ain't going to be there day one

20:20.760 --> 20:22.760
And I have to admit I'm a little bit disappointed

20:22.760 --> 20:24.760
And you know

20:24.760 --> 20:26.760
Some folks are trying to needle me on Twitter a little bit

20:26.760 --> 20:28.760
Saying, oh Rob

20:28.760 --> 20:30.760
Do you really have to play Balloon Fight on a

20:30.760 --> 20:32.760
30 year old game on a brand new Nintendo console

20:32.760 --> 20:34.760
And it's like

20:34.760 --> 20:36.760
Well, yes

20:36.760 --> 20:38.760
Actually

20:38.760 --> 20:40.760
Because something that the Switch can do

20:40.760 --> 20:42.760
That the other systems that

20:42.760 --> 20:44.760
Virtual Console isn't available on

20:44.760 --> 20:46.760
Is the whole fact that I could be playing

20:46.760 --> 20:48.760
Something on my TV and then

20:48.760 --> 20:50.760
Pick up my Switch and go somewhere else with it

20:50.760 --> 20:52.760
And I was looking forward to being able to do that with

20:52.760 --> 20:54.760
Yes, the old games too

20:54.760 --> 20:56.760
Or the whole fact that

20:56.760 --> 20:58.760
Perhaps if we're playing a two player game

20:58.760 --> 21:00.760
Like the original Mario Brothers

21:00.760 --> 21:02.760
Not Super Mario Brothers, the original Mario Brothers

21:02.760 --> 21:04.760
Maybe I could have a Switch

21:04.760 --> 21:06.760
And my friend who's over has a Switch

21:06.760 --> 21:08.760
And we can play old school console

21:08.760 --> 21:10.760
Games like that, you know

21:10.760 --> 21:12.760
Like in the same room and be having fun with that

21:12.760 --> 21:14.760
Right? So, yeah

21:14.760 --> 21:16.760
I am a little disappointed that's not going to be there day one

21:16.760 --> 21:18.760
I understand that Virtual Console will probably

21:18.760 --> 21:20.760
Happen eventually

21:20.760 --> 21:22.760
But it's another one of those things

21:22.760 --> 21:24.760
Where I'm like, this launch

21:24.760 --> 21:26.760
Is starting to feel more and more

21:26.760 --> 21:28.760
Half-assed

21:28.760 --> 21:30.760
And then I had one of my friends

21:30.760 --> 21:32.760
Telling me about how, well when you look

21:32.760 --> 21:34.760
At the other console launches

21:34.760 --> 21:36.760
You know, how can you say that Nintendo is half-assed

21:36.760 --> 21:38.760
Because PlayStation 4 had

21:38.760 --> 21:40.760
All these ports when it came out and dah dah dah

21:40.760 --> 21:42.760
And all this other stuff

21:42.760 --> 21:44.760
Here's the thing

21:44.760 --> 21:46.760
I was thinking about that

21:46.760 --> 21:48.760
And this is one of the other key differences

21:48.760 --> 21:50.760
The reason why I'm really feeling

21:50.760 --> 21:52.760
This a lot is of how

21:52.760 --> 21:54.760
Shady

21:54.760 --> 21:56.760
Nintendo is being with the information

21:56.760 --> 21:58.760
At least with PlayStation 4

21:58.760 --> 22:00.760
At least with Xbox

22:00.760 --> 22:02.760
And these other systems

22:02.760 --> 22:04.760
We pretty much knew months in advance

22:04.760 --> 22:06.760
Exactly what was going to come out of that box

22:06.760 --> 22:08.760
We learned the answer about Virtual Console

22:08.760 --> 22:10.760
This week

22:10.760 --> 22:12.760
We still don't know the answers about online

22:12.760 --> 22:14.760
And this is out in five days

22:14.760 --> 22:16.760
Right? That's the shit that is starting

22:16.760 --> 22:18.760
To make this really feel like

22:18.760 --> 22:20.760
We're pulling it out of our asses as we go

22:20.760 --> 22:22.760
We don't have any sort of like

22:22.760 --> 22:24.760
And even the PlayStation 3 or even

22:24.760 --> 22:26.760
Xbox 360, Xbox One

22:26.760 --> 22:28.760
There was no question of how online

22:28.760 --> 22:30.760
Was going to work for those systems

22:30.760 --> 22:32.760
Or even that most of the feature sets

22:32.760 --> 22:34.760
Advertised for it are going to be there at launch

22:34.760 --> 22:36.760
Not, oh hey

22:36.760 --> 22:38.760
Patch it in later

22:38.760 --> 22:40.760
Dartitsuyu in chat says

22:40.760 --> 22:42.760
But to be fair, is Virtual Console really

22:42.760 --> 22:44.760
A huge deal? In the meantime, they're going to get

22:44.760 --> 22:46.760
Arcade Archives, so if you need your retro fix

22:46.760 --> 22:48.760
That would be the way to go

22:48.760 --> 22:50.760
Arcade Archives is cool, but have they said

22:50.760 --> 22:52.760
Witch games in the archives, there's

22:52.760 --> 22:54.760
Kind of a lot of garbage in the Arcade Archives

22:54.760 --> 22:56.760
There's some good stuff, there's some good Neo Geo

22:56.760 --> 22:58.760
Fighters and like Bubble Bobble

22:58.760 --> 23:00.760
Isn't that just Virtual Console anyways?

23:00.760 --> 23:02.760
It's Sony's thing, it's like arcade emulation

23:02.760 --> 23:04.760
Basically, and yeah, it's

23:04.760 --> 23:06.760
It is kind of just Virtual Console, so it is weird

23:06.760 --> 23:08.760
To me that it's, the Arcade Archives

23:08.760 --> 23:10.760
Thing is getting a whole spinoff, but

23:10.760 --> 23:12.760
Whatever, it doesn't make sense

23:12.760 --> 23:14.760
It's probably because

23:14.760 --> 23:16.760
Their networking shit ain't worked out

23:16.760 --> 23:18.760
Because if you think about it

23:18.760 --> 23:20.760
That isn't

23:20.760 --> 23:22.760
I mean, I guess it does make sense that Virtual Console

23:22.760 --> 23:24.760
Is not there, because they're saying that Virtual Console now

23:24.760 --> 23:26.760
Is going to support net play over

23:26.760 --> 23:28.760
You know, over the internet

23:28.760 --> 23:30.760
As you're going to be able to do multiplayer

23:30.760 --> 23:32.760
So because they don't have their net code shit figured out

23:32.760 --> 23:34.760
That's why you don't have the networking

23:34.760 --> 23:36.760
The online networking right now, or multiplayer

23:36.760 --> 23:38.760
For the most part

23:38.760 --> 23:40.760
I mean, at least that paid service

23:40.760 --> 23:42.760
And maybe that's why Virtual Console's not out

23:42.760 --> 23:44.760
Whereas these arcade games don't have

23:44.760 --> 23:46.760
That, or at least I assume they don't have

23:46.760 --> 23:48.760
That internet play

23:48.760 --> 23:50.760
And so that's why they're able to just dump them on there

23:50.760 --> 23:52.760
So anyway, um

23:52.760 --> 23:54.760
Let's see, what's the other thing here

23:54.760 --> 23:56.760
Sj100matt in chat says

23:56.760 --> 23:58.760
I would like a Virtual Console lineup to supplement the inevitable

23:58.760 --> 24:00.760
Dead period between games on the Switch

24:00.760 --> 24:02.760
Yeah, that's true too

24:02.760 --> 24:04.760
And to be fair, maybe there was a part of me

24:04.760 --> 24:06.760
That was hoping that Nintendo was

24:06.760 --> 24:08.760
Going to do it differently this time

24:08.760 --> 24:10.760
With Virtual Console, I know, hahaha

24:10.760 --> 24:12.760
But that they would actually have a

24:12.760 --> 24:14.760
Constant flow of Virtual Console

24:14.760 --> 24:16.760
Releases, which if you look at the Wii U

24:16.760 --> 24:18.760
In the past couple years, it has not been a constant flow

24:18.760 --> 24:20.760
But, you know, God

24:20.760 --> 24:22.760
There's this story floating around the internet

24:22.760 --> 24:24.760
About a guy who just beat

24:24.760 --> 24:26.760
714 Nintendo

24:26.760 --> 24:28.760
Games on his Twitch stream, right?

24:28.760 --> 24:30.760
There's a big story going around about that this week, right?

24:30.760 --> 24:32.760
So there's over

24:32.760 --> 24:34.760
700 Nintendo games

24:34.760 --> 24:36.760
That they could put on Virtual Console

24:36.760 --> 24:38.760
You put one game a week

24:38.760 --> 24:40.760
And that's just Nintendo

24:40.760 --> 24:42.760
You put one game a week

24:42.760 --> 24:44.760
And that would carry that system for over

24:44.760 --> 24:46.760
10 years

24:46.760 --> 24:48.760
Like with new stuff

24:48.760 --> 24:50.760
Ok, I understand, some of those games are garbage

24:50.760 --> 24:52.760
Licensing issues

24:52.760 --> 24:54.760
Blah de blah de blah, fine

24:54.760 --> 24:56.760
Get like 200 of the 700 games

24:56.760 --> 24:58.760
Less than a third

24:58.760 --> 25:00.760
Get 200 of them

25:00.760 --> 25:02.760
That's still going to be like one new game a week

25:02.760 --> 25:04.760
For almost 4 years

25:04.760 --> 25:06.760
And that's just Nintendo

25:06.760 --> 25:08.760
That's not even counting

25:08.760 --> 25:10.760
Super Nintendo, Genesis, Turbo Graphics

25:10.760 --> 25:12.760
Commodore 64 they could bring back

25:12.760 --> 25:14.760
Because that's the soft spot in my heart

25:14.760 --> 25:16.760
They did like 4 Commodore 64 games on the Wii

25:16.760 --> 25:18.760
And then that was it

25:18.760 --> 25:20.760
Yeah, I guess I'm just a little bummed

25:20.760 --> 25:22.760
I was just hoping

25:22.760 --> 25:24.760
Maybe Virtual Console would be a little better

25:24.760 --> 25:26.760
This time

25:26.760 --> 25:28.760
Doesn't sound like it's going to be

25:28.760 --> 25:30.760
So it's a little bit disappointing in my opinion

25:30.760 --> 25:32.760
But

25:32.760 --> 25:34.760
I will give Nintendo this credit

25:34.760 --> 25:36.760
Because, oh my gosh, I can be critical

25:36.760 --> 25:38.760
And I can say good things too

25:38.760 --> 25:40.760
And I am very excited to hear

25:40.760 --> 25:42.760
That it sounds like more games are actually

25:42.760 --> 25:44.760
Making the launch day, right?

25:44.760 --> 25:46.760
Yeah, more games are making the launch day

25:46.760 --> 25:48.760
And also with that

25:48.760 --> 25:50.760
They're physical games, you know

25:50.760 --> 25:52.760
If you're like, of course, buying digitally

25:52.760 --> 25:54.760
You're going to have to install everything

25:54.760 --> 25:56.760
But they're physical games, unlike the PlayStation 4

25:56.760 --> 25:58.760
And Xbox One

25:58.760 --> 26:00.760
Do not require an install on top of

26:00.760 --> 26:02.760
The game

26:02.760 --> 26:04.760
It's just going to be whatever's on that

26:04.760 --> 26:06.760
That cartridge

26:06.760 --> 26:08.760
That's going to be cool

26:08.760 --> 26:10.760
At least right now

26:10.760 --> 26:12.760
Can't promise that for the future

26:12.760 --> 26:14.760
Yeah, that's still cool

26:14.760 --> 26:16.760
That more games are going to make the actual launch day

26:16.760 --> 26:18.760
I know I'm very excited for Fast Racing

26:18.760 --> 26:20.760
Neo Remix

26:20.760 --> 26:22.760
Thought that was a very competent game on the Wii U

26:22.760 --> 26:24.760
So I'm excited to see what they do with that

26:24.760 --> 26:26.760
With the Switch

26:26.760 --> 26:28.760
Now that's another game I will have to get on March 3

26:28.760 --> 26:30.760
Because right now, as it was

26:30.760 --> 26:32.760
I was really only going to get Zelda

26:32.760 --> 26:34.760
I'm not really interested in the Bomberman

26:34.760 --> 26:36.760
Thing, which I've talked about before

26:36.760 --> 26:38.760
Maybe when I see it in action, I'll change my mind

26:38.760 --> 26:40.760
But I'm not willing to

26:40.760 --> 26:42.760
Take the leap of faith on Bomberman

26:42.760 --> 26:44.760
The way I'm willing to do with Zelda

26:44.760 --> 26:46.760
But I know Fast Racing Neo, I'm willing to take the leap of faith with that

26:46.760 --> 26:48.760
So I'm excited to get that

26:48.760 --> 26:50.760
And what, Snipperclips

26:50.760 --> 26:52.760
Or whatever they're calling that, that's out

26:52.760 --> 26:54.760
On March 3rd as well

26:54.760 --> 26:56.760
Nippleclamps, that's out on March 3rd as well

26:56.760 --> 26:58.760
You can use your Joy-Con

26:58.760 --> 27:00.760
And explore fun new ways with your friends

27:00.760 --> 27:02.760
To titillate

27:02.760 --> 27:04.760
With HD vibrations

27:04.760 --> 27:06.760
But yeah, Snipperclips

27:06.760 --> 27:08.760
I'm sure will be fun

27:08.760 --> 27:10.760
And that might be a good in the same room type of game too

27:10.760 --> 27:12.760
So I mean, yes, there's positive things as well

27:12.760 --> 27:14.760
I like that

27:14.760 --> 27:16.760
Okay, now Nintendo's coming out swinging out the door

27:16.760 --> 27:18.760
With more than just Zelda

27:18.760 --> 27:20.760
Even though, you know, of course, Zelda's a big freaking deal

27:20.760 --> 27:22.760
But that'll be nice

27:22.760 --> 27:24.760
So, I'm still getting my Switch

27:24.760 --> 27:26.760
I can huff and puff about Virtual Console

27:26.760 --> 27:28.760
I think I'm just

27:28.760 --> 27:30.760
Accepting that

27:30.760 --> 27:32.760
The Switch for right now

27:32.760 --> 27:34.760
Is going to be a Zelda machine

27:34.760 --> 27:36.760
For the first couple months

27:36.760 --> 27:38.760
And Nintendo should really be thanking BioWare

27:38.760 --> 27:40.760
For going to be distracting me

27:40.760 --> 27:42.760
With Mass Effect Andromeda

27:42.760 --> 27:44.760
In these first few months

27:44.760 --> 27:46.760
Right after, you know, I get some good hands on time with Zelda

27:46.760 --> 27:48.760
And then by the time I'm done with Mass Effect Andromeda

27:48.760 --> 27:50.760
Oh, here comes Mario Kart

27:50.760 --> 27:52.760
Splatoon 2

27:52.760 --> 27:54.760
And everything else that, you know, we have to look forward to

27:54.760 --> 27:56.760
Do you have all your amiibo pre-ordered?

27:56.760 --> 27:58.760
Because you gotta get all the amiibo stuff

27:58.760 --> 28:00.760
Nintendo seems to think so

28:00.760 --> 28:02.760
So, yeah

28:02.760 --> 28:04.760
So, I mean, at least

28:04.760 --> 28:06.760
There's that and, you know, by the summer

28:06.760 --> 28:08.760
We get Splatoon 2, which is a big deal

28:08.760 --> 28:10.760
Arms, I'm hearing a lot of

28:10.760 --> 28:12.760
Positive stuff on, I'm still skeptical

28:12.760 --> 28:14.760
But I'm willing to say, okay, well

28:14.760 --> 28:16.760
Let me get it in my arms and play with it

28:16.760 --> 28:18.760
And maybe I'll be sold on it

28:18.760 --> 28:20.760
I'm excited to check it out

28:20.760 --> 28:22.760
And then Holiday will be

28:22.760 --> 28:24.760
The Mario game, I know, Loki

28:24.760 --> 28:26.760
You like to joke that it'll get delayed

28:26.760 --> 28:28.760
I think we all know Nintendo can't afford to delay that

28:28.760 --> 28:30.760
They'll have that on Holiday

28:30.760 --> 28:32.760
Or they'll have some big fucking title for Holiday

28:32.760 --> 28:34.760
They have to, because the real launch

28:34.760 --> 28:36.760
Of the Switch is Holiday

28:36.760 --> 28:38.760
I fully expect Virtual Consoles in place

28:38.760 --> 28:40.760
Probably in October

28:40.760 --> 28:42.760
Star Fox Zero, again

28:42.760 --> 28:44.760
No, they're not that bold

28:44.760 --> 28:46.760
I hope not, anyway

28:46.760 --> 28:48.760
Let's see, JD is in our chat over at

28:48.760 --> 28:50.760
Live.vognetwork.com saying

28:50.760 --> 28:52.760
A couple people I know who went to the demo

28:52.760 --> 28:54.760
The San Francisco thing this weekend

28:54.760 --> 28:56.760
I wasn't sold on Arms until I

28:56.760 --> 28:58.760
Played it. William

28:58.760 --> 29:00.760
Murderface points out Stormblood

29:00.760 --> 29:02.760
Will be a nice time sink as well, that's right

29:02.760 --> 29:04.760
Final Fantasy XIV gets an expansion

29:04.760 --> 29:06.760
Nintendo can thank Square Enix as well

29:06.760 --> 29:08.760
For that, so there'll be things to distract

29:08.760 --> 29:10.760
Me from, you know, okay

29:10.760 --> 29:12.760
I'm done with Zelda on the Switch, now what?

29:12.760 --> 29:14.760
So, alright

29:14.760 --> 29:16.760
Anyway, what else on the Switch?

29:16.760 --> 29:18.760
Anything else we need to talk about with the Switch before

29:18.760 --> 29:20.760
We move on into gaming weeks and

29:20.760 --> 29:22.760
What else is going on? Just most of the downloads are

29:22.760 --> 29:24.760
Pretty reasonably sized, it looks like anything that's

29:24.760 --> 29:26.760
More of just like a digital only titles

29:26.760 --> 29:28.760
Is they're gonna be about 1 gig

29:28.760 --> 29:30.760
Ish, whereas

29:30.760 --> 29:32.760
You know, comparable

29:32.760 --> 29:34.760
Download sizes to the Wii U

29:34.760 --> 29:36.760
Cause I was looking at, they had Mario Kart 8 listed

29:36.760 --> 29:38.760
On there, and it's about the same size as

29:38.760 --> 29:40.760
On the Wii U, which makes sense cause

29:40.760 --> 29:42.760
The visuals are pretty much the same

29:42.760 --> 29:44.760
And then, you know, Zelda of course

29:44.760 --> 29:46.760
Being the biggest one, like 13.6

29:46.760 --> 29:48.760
Gigs or something

29:48.760 --> 29:50.760
Which is like half your storage right there

29:51.760 --> 29:53.760
Yeah, because even though they say 32 gigs

29:53.760 --> 29:55.760
The operating system

29:55.760 --> 29:57.760
Takes up so much of it, and there's gonna be a

29:57.760 --> 29:59.760
Day one patch by the way, so

29:59.760 --> 30:01.760
Expect that more of it will get eaten up

30:01.760 --> 30:03.760
Just don't buy digitally, at least on this system

30:03.760 --> 30:05.760
Cause it doesn't really make sense as far as

30:05.760 --> 30:07.760
Being able to store it on there right now

30:07.760 --> 30:09.760
And because Nintendo's so good

30:09.760 --> 30:11.760
At not dropping prices of their games

30:11.760 --> 30:13.760
So that means your game's gonna be worthwhile

30:13.760 --> 30:15.760
Later on, and once you've finally played out

30:15.760 --> 30:17.760
Zelda to your heart's content

30:17.760 --> 30:19.760
Then you can always sell it back later on

30:20.760 --> 30:22.760
Like Fast Racing Neo, is that getting a physical release?

30:22.760 --> 30:24.760
No, that's not, but like I'm talking about the ones you do have a choice

30:24.760 --> 30:26.760
You know, just buy it at retail

30:26.760 --> 30:28.760
Is I Am Setsuna still a March 3rd game?

30:28.760 --> 30:30.760
I think so

30:30.760 --> 30:32.760
I haven't checked that out on the other platforms yet

30:32.760 --> 30:34.760
So I was thinking about maybe getting that one too on the Switch

30:34.760 --> 30:37.760
Just to buff up the library a little bit

30:37.760 --> 30:39.760
So, yeah, okay

30:39.760 --> 30:42.760
Well, I'm gonna definitely pick up a Switch on Friday

30:42.760 --> 30:45.760
And I can't wait to talk all about it on the next edition of the show

30:45.760 --> 30:47.760
I'm hoping over the weekend, at some point

30:47.760 --> 30:49.760
I can connect with some other people that own a Switch

30:49.760 --> 30:52.760
And we can test out some of the multiplayer stuff

30:52.760 --> 30:55.760
And, you know, get a feel for it

30:55.760 --> 30:57.760
You know, I'm still excited, despite these things

30:57.760 --> 31:00.760
Where I'm like, I have to constantly lower expectations sometimes

31:00.760 --> 31:02.760
I am still excited

31:02.760 --> 31:04.760
I'm excited because everything I'm hearing

31:04.760 --> 31:07.760
About the whole fact that, you know, you play on the TV

31:07.760 --> 31:09.760
And then you pick it up and take it with you

31:09.760 --> 31:11.760
It's super seamless, it's fast

31:11.760 --> 31:14.760
It works the way you think it would based on the previews

31:14.760 --> 31:16.760
I think a lot of that sounds really exciting

31:16.760 --> 31:20.760
It sounds like, if nothing else, as a tech nerd

31:20.760 --> 31:22.760
The technology's gonna be awesome

31:22.760 --> 31:25.760
Even if sometimes I wish Nintendo would do a little more with the technology

31:25.760 --> 31:26.760
That's all it is

31:26.760 --> 31:29.760
So, yeah, and DungeonBuster in chat over at live.vognetwork.com

31:29.760 --> 31:31.760
Says, it's been getting good reviews so far

31:31.760 --> 31:34.760
And ActDeft confirming, iAmSatsuna is March 3rd, yeah

31:34.760 --> 31:38.760
JD pointing out, aren't SD cards cheap and easy to upgrade on consoles?

31:38.760 --> 31:39.760
Yeah, there is that

31:39.760 --> 31:41.760
So, I mean, even though Loki's saying, don't go digital

31:41.760 --> 31:44.760
I still understand, I understand what you're saying when it comes to like that

31:44.760 --> 31:46.760
But does it have expanded storage on that console?

31:46.760 --> 31:49.760
Oh, yeah, you can pop in another SD card, that's it

31:49.760 --> 31:52.760
Are they gonna allow you to save to it?

31:52.760 --> 31:54.760
Yes, yes, no, that's not a problem

31:54.760 --> 31:59.760
They are making that a lot easier than it was on their other systems

31:59.760 --> 32:02.760
So that part's, well, even on the Wii, it really wasn't that bad

32:02.760 --> 32:05.760
But I think it's even gonna be a little better on the Switch

32:05.760 --> 32:07.760
I'm not worried about that end of it at all

32:07.760 --> 32:10.760
But I think you do raise a damn good point

32:10.760 --> 32:16.760
When, and I've always said this, you know, what's the benefit in me buying digital, right?

32:16.760 --> 32:20.760
Because you said Nintendo doesn't drop the price on their games for a long time

32:20.760 --> 32:21.760
So you have more

32:21.760 --> 32:22.760
Or at all, I mean

32:22.760 --> 32:24.760
You have more equity basically in those cartridges

32:24.760 --> 32:26.760
Those cartridges are still worth something

32:26.760 --> 32:28.760
So if you do get sick of the game, you can sell it back

32:28.760 --> 32:30.760
And you make some money back

32:30.760 --> 32:32.760
Whereas with digital games, you don't ever get to do that

32:32.760 --> 32:35.760
Yeah, like, I mean, I'm not saying that Zelda isn't necessarily a great example

32:35.760 --> 32:38.760
Because Zelda's gonna be probably, I mean, that Zelda

32:38.760 --> 32:41.760
I think it's gonna be one that's gonna have a lot of replayability on it

32:41.760 --> 32:43.760
But like something like ARMS or something

32:43.760 --> 32:45.760
Where you may buy it and it may be fun for a while

32:45.760 --> 32:48.760
And it's just like, okay, listen, I'm just not really interested in playing this anymore

32:48.760 --> 32:52.760
That might be something that's worth picking up physically and doing that

32:52.760 --> 32:55.760
I mean, I'm definitely looking forward to picking up Zelda

32:55.760 --> 32:57.760
Just to be picking it up on the Wii U

32:57.760 --> 33:01.760
I haven't pre-ordered it, so I'll try to go pick it up day one

33:01.760 --> 33:05.760
And if they say, oh, it's not available, like, well, fine, I'll just download it

33:05.760 --> 33:08.760
I'm not pre-ordering your shit fucking GameStop

33:08.760 --> 33:12.760
Let's see, a couple of people in chat talking about the whole memory card thing

33:12.760 --> 33:17.760
And a couple of people saying it looks like two terabytes may be the cap on the memory cards

33:17.760 --> 33:19.760
And what the Switch supports, but, okay, two terabytes

33:19.760 --> 33:22.760
Let's not get ahead of ourselves, I mean, there's not that many games coming out for you

33:22.760 --> 33:24.760
I mean, shit

33:24.760 --> 33:26.760
You could probably fit

33:26.760 --> 33:27.760
That's a little much

33:27.760 --> 33:30.760
You could probably fit everything that Nintendo's gonna release this year on that kind of card

33:30.760 --> 33:32.760
Or in the lifetime of the system

33:32.760 --> 33:34.760
But that is low-key

33:34.760 --> 33:39.760
That is good, though, that, you know, yes, it will go that high if people do want to do the digital thing

33:39.760 --> 33:41.760
Because there are people that disagree

33:41.760 --> 33:44.760
And they think that the digital thing is much more of a convenience

33:44.760 --> 33:46.760
Especially those that are gonna be more portable with the system

33:46.760 --> 33:47.760
Fine, more power to you

33:47.760 --> 33:52.760
They are really missing out, though, not having YouTube or Netflix or anything on that thing

33:52.760 --> 33:55.760
I'm serious, like, that's what my son uses before we got his tablet

33:55.760 --> 33:56.760
That's the way he would use it

33:56.760 --> 33:59.760
And he still uses the Wii U for that, is watching YouTube

33:59.760 --> 34:05.760
And I think Netflix on the TV to the portable instantly is a real missed opportunity

34:05.760 --> 34:09.760
We talked about that in a previous episode, I'm not gonna re-hide that

34:09.760 --> 34:12.760
But, you know what, maybe it'll be there by holiday

34:12.760 --> 34:16.760
I think we need to go back and re-evaluate, I think it'll be interesting

34:16.760 --> 34:21.760
I almost feel like I wanna, like, write down every- maybe we'll do this on the next episode of OLR

34:21.760 --> 34:23.760
Tell me if you guys think this is a good idea

34:23.760 --> 34:28.760
On the next episode of OLR, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna write down the list of my grievances

34:28.760 --> 34:31.760
And things I wish they would do better on the Switch

34:31.760 --> 34:35.760
I'm gonna write it down, and we're gonna put it in an envelope and leave it here in the studio

34:35.760 --> 34:43.760
And during the Christmas episode of OLR, we're gonna open it and see what problems Nintendo addressed during the year to make the console a full-fledged system

34:43.760 --> 34:45.760
Shortest time capsule ever

34:45.760 --> 34:47.760
Yeah, shortest time capsule ever

34:47.760 --> 34:48.760
I like that, that's the segment

34:48.760 --> 34:51.760
Short attention span time capsule

34:51.760 --> 34:53.760
We should just do one of those every year

34:53.760 --> 34:55.760
I think it's a good idea, short attention span time

34:55.760 --> 35:01.760
Well, shit, episodes of this show are kind of- we could just always go back and listen to an old episode of OLR

35:01.760 --> 35:04.760
But that would involve us having to listen to ourselves

35:04.760 --> 35:05.760
I don't wanna do that

35:05.760 --> 35:07.760
No, not gonna do that

35:07.760 --> 35:09.760
I certainly don't wanna listen to myself the way I sound right now

35:11.760 --> 35:13.760
I don't even wanna talk the way I sound right now

35:13.760 --> 35:15.760
Alright, done

35:15.760 --> 35:16.760
JD in a sock

35:16.760 --> 35:19.760
Yes, JD in chat says a mini time capsule is a great idea

35:19.760 --> 35:22.760
Come on, Noel Gus in chat says put your list in a sock

35:22.760 --> 35:23.760
And you know what?

35:23.760 --> 35:25.760
I love it, we're gonna put it in a sock

35:25.760 --> 35:29.760
No, you know, we need a time capsule, you know what that means?

35:29.760 --> 35:32.760
We need to get one of those little containers of the mini Tootsie Rolls

35:32.760 --> 35:34.760
That's actually also doubles as a piggy bank

35:34.760 --> 35:35.760
I gave you one

35:35.760 --> 35:36.760
And there you go

35:36.760 --> 35:37.760
So vanilla ones

35:37.760 --> 35:39.760
I wasn't thinking of the short attention span time capsule

35:39.760 --> 35:42.760
And then on top of that, we get mini Tootsie Rolls

35:42.760 --> 35:44.760
I support this play, okay

35:44.760 --> 35:49.760
And we'll leave one in the time capsule as a present to ourselves

35:49.760 --> 35:53.760
You know what? I should like put in like a clipping of my hair to see if my hair color is like

35:53.760 --> 35:54.760
Is that gonna be like a

35:54.760 --> 35:56.760
Pused by the end of the year or something

35:56.760 --> 35:57.760
Okay, I love it

35:57.760 --> 36:01.760
We're creating a scene in the Christmas story where we're like we're cutting it into three pieces, you know

36:01.760 --> 36:02.760
This mini Tootsie

36:02.760 --> 36:04.760
Alright, this is happening on the next OLR

36:04.760 --> 36:08.760
Short attention span time capsule 2017 edition Nintendo Switch

36:08.760 --> 36:10.760
I actually think I still have one of those containers somewhere

36:10.760 --> 36:13.760
Alright, then bring it to the show and that can be our time capsule

36:13.760 --> 36:14.760
Let's go buy another one

36:14.760 --> 36:16.760
If not, then I'll just go to the dollar store

36:16.760 --> 36:18.760
I will find a sock

36:18.760 --> 36:19.760
Get a plastic bin

36:19.760 --> 36:21.760
We'll paint it silver

36:21.760 --> 36:24.760
Okay, it has to fit here in the studio somewhere

36:24.760 --> 36:25.760
We have to

36:27.760 --> 36:28.760
Alright, I love it

36:28.760 --> 36:30.760
Come on, Noel Gush suggests

36:30.760 --> 36:33.760
Go to the 99 cent only store and put a Lego dimensions figure in it as well

36:33.760 --> 36:36.760
Dude, yeah, like I want to run across those

36:36.760 --> 36:40.760
Like my son got one as like a Valentine's Day card or whatever

36:40.760 --> 36:42.760
And of course he's like, I don't want this

36:42.760 --> 36:44.760
And it was the Simpsons car

36:44.760 --> 36:46.760
I was like, sweet, where do I get more of these?

36:46.760 --> 36:48.760
I like building Legos

36:49.760 --> 36:51.760
Like more than any person probably should

36:51.760 --> 36:53.760
But I like it

36:53.760 --> 36:56.760
Alright, anything else on the Switch we need to talk about before Friday?

36:56.760 --> 36:57.760
No

36:57.760 --> 36:59.760
Alright, there it is

36:59.760 --> 37:01.760
So, Darsakha, will you at least

37:01.760 --> 37:03.760
Will you try playing with my Switch before we

37:03.760 --> 37:05.760
Shove things in a sock?

37:09.760 --> 37:12.760
I'm going to pretend that you didn't phrase it exactly that way

37:12.760 --> 37:13.760
Alright

37:13.760 --> 37:14.760
I would entertain

37:14.760 --> 37:15.760
Phrasing

37:15.760 --> 37:17.760
I would entertain the possibility

37:17.760 --> 37:20.760
Of a demo of the Nintendo Switch

37:20.760 --> 37:22.760
That you just happen to own

37:22.760 --> 37:24.760
Socks not included

37:24.760 --> 37:26.760
Okay, fair enough

37:28.760 --> 37:30.760
JD in chat simply says, whoa

37:30.760 --> 37:32.760
Phrasing

37:32.760 --> 37:34.760
That's Emmison Mansey

37:34.760 --> 37:36.760
You know what, that's going to be our quote

37:36.760 --> 37:39.760
Our word of the year, like Tatiana's choices

37:39.760 --> 37:40.760
Phrasing

37:40.760 --> 37:41.760
Phrasing

37:41.760 --> 37:43.760
That Archer episode was like four years ago

37:43.760 --> 37:45.760
So I kind of think

37:45.760 --> 37:47.760
That's like every Archer episode

37:47.760 --> 37:49.760
I've only watched like one season of Archer

37:49.760 --> 37:51.760
Okay, first off

37:51.760 --> 37:53.760
And What's Your Face was pregnant most of it

37:53.760 --> 37:55.760
First off, Archer is fucking amazing

37:55.760 --> 37:57.760
Like it's got some of the greatest quotes in it

37:57.760 --> 37:59.760
Like I just said, Emmison Mansey

37:59.760 --> 38:01.760
Do you like ants?

38:01.760 --> 38:03.760
Do you want ants? Because that's how you get ants

38:03.760 --> 38:05.760
Why not that?

38:05.760 --> 38:07.760
Lots of great

38:07.760 --> 38:09.760
Archer quotes, anyway

38:09.760 --> 38:13.760
Let's move on

38:13.760 --> 38:15.760
I was ready to move on

38:15.760 --> 38:17.760
Let's move on to our

38:17.760 --> 38:19.760
Too many socks

38:19.760 --> 38:21.760
Alright, that's in the 2015 capsule

38:21.760 --> 38:23.760
Oh god

38:23.760 --> 38:25.760
How was your gaming week?

38:25.760 --> 38:27.760
What types of video games have you been playing this week?

38:27.760 --> 38:29.760
And what socks have you been wearing?

38:29.760 --> 38:31.760
Dark Sakura

38:31.760 --> 38:33.760
I have these very cushy socks that I got at Daiso

38:33.760 --> 38:35.760
In Roseville

38:35.760 --> 38:37.760
They're $1.25 a piece

38:37.760 --> 38:39.760
And their pile, they're very comfortable

38:39.760 --> 38:41.760
They're my new favorite pair of socks

38:41.760 --> 38:43.760
For $1.25?

38:43.760 --> 38:45.760
Yeah, seriously, fucking Daiso

38:45.760 --> 38:47.760
I know what a Daiso is

38:47.760 --> 38:49.760
Cat socks at Daiso, worth every penny

38:49.760 --> 38:51.760
One of those vacuums?

38:51.760 --> 38:53.760
That's Dyson

38:53.760 --> 38:55.760
It's like a Japanese Dollar Tree

38:55.760 --> 38:57.760
It's like the Dollar Tree that everything in there is like

38:57.760 --> 38:59.760
In Japan it's like a Yen store

38:59.760 --> 39:01.760
Where's this? The Galleria

39:01.760 --> 39:03.760
They have one at the Galleria and they're putting one in South Sac

39:03.760 --> 39:05.760
Which is going to be like

39:05.760 --> 39:07.760
Daiso, yeah

39:07.760 --> 39:09.760
Oh my god, I'm going to be so happy

39:09.760 --> 39:11.760
I fucking love Daiso

39:11.760 --> 39:13.760
Anyway, so now that the socks are out of the way

39:13.760 --> 39:15.760
Let's go ahead and get on to my

39:15.760 --> 39:17.760
game I've been playing

39:17.760 --> 39:19.760
Game singular, because fuck

39:19.760 --> 39:21.760
AkumaJP is pointing out it's a 100 Yen shop

39:21.760 --> 39:23.760
That's what I corrected myself

39:23.760 --> 39:25.760
Okay, I was going to say 1 Yen is actually not a lot of money

39:25.760 --> 39:27.760
No, I corrected myself

39:27.760 --> 39:29.760
It's like the Peso store

39:29.760 --> 39:31.760
Did everyone not hear when I corrected myself?

39:31.760 --> 39:33.760
No, we were laughing too hard at the sock thing

39:33.760 --> 39:35.760
Girl, okay

39:35.760 --> 39:37.760
Video games!

39:37.760 --> 39:39.760
But also my Daiso socks are amazing

39:39.760 --> 39:41.760
Anyway, so I've just been playing World of Warcraft

39:41.760 --> 39:43.760
Like, a lot

39:43.760 --> 39:45.760
Dan's probably

39:45.760 --> 39:47.760
Addict

39:47.760 --> 39:49.760
You know what, yeah, kinda

39:49.760 --> 39:51.760
How does it feel all these years later?

39:51.760 --> 39:53.760
Well, I really, though, I like this whole

39:53.760 --> 39:55.760
expansion because

39:55.760 --> 39:57.760
I am an Illidan fangirl

39:57.760 --> 39:59.760
And it's just been

39:59.760 --> 40:01.760
Demon Hunties all over the place

40:01.760 --> 40:03.760
Addict

40:03.760 --> 40:05.760
You should still play with me in VRT

40:05.760 --> 40:07.760
Because it's fun

40:07.760 --> 40:09.760
Are the gameboy.org guys ever on there?

40:09.760 --> 40:11.760
John was on once

40:11.760 --> 40:13.760
To give me

40:13.760 --> 40:15.760
Guild adding privileges

40:15.760 --> 40:17.760
Oh, cool

40:17.760 --> 40:19.760
And then, I actually

40:19.760 --> 40:21.760
I had bad

40:21.760 --> 40:23.760
insomnia one night and played Bust a Move

40:23.760 --> 40:25.760
on my phone, as in Puzzle Bobble

40:25.760 --> 40:27.760
And

40:27.760 --> 40:29.760
I don't know what the hell I did

40:29.760 --> 40:31.760
I was on some fucking streak

40:31.760 --> 40:33.760
And my highest

40:33.760 --> 40:35.760
score had been like 500,000

40:35.760 --> 40:37.760
for a while

40:37.760 --> 40:39.760
I hit 1,500,000

40:39.760 --> 40:41.760
And I don't even know what I did

40:41.760 --> 40:43.760
So, lots of Bust a Move

40:43.760 --> 40:45.760
And then

40:45.760 --> 40:47.760
Pokemon Go, because all the new Pokemans

40:47.760 --> 40:49.760
are out and they're adorable

40:49.760 --> 40:51.760
Except for this one thing

40:51.760 --> 40:53.760
That I wasn't even thinking of Magma being part of its name

40:53.760 --> 40:55.760
And you know how I feel about

40:55.760 --> 40:57.760
Snails and Slugs, I hate them

40:57.760 --> 40:59.760
And it was called

40:59.760 --> 41:01.760
It's Slugma

41:01.760 --> 41:03.760
Slugma, right

41:03.760 --> 41:05.760
I didn't for a moment think about Magma

41:05.760 --> 41:07.760
Do not go to the nastiest place possible on this show

41:07.760 --> 41:09.760
I did go to the nastiest place possible

41:09.760 --> 41:11.760
That's all you need to say

41:11.760 --> 41:13.760
Until someone pointed out that

41:13.760 --> 41:15.760
No, that's fire and it's magma

41:15.760 --> 41:17.760
And not the favorite curse from Red Dwarf

41:17.760 --> 41:19.760
So

41:19.760 --> 41:21.760
Yeah

41:21.760 --> 41:23.760
I caught one and I don't care anymore

41:23.760 --> 41:25.760
So

41:25.760 --> 41:27.760
Um

41:27.760 --> 41:29.760
I have a Furret now

41:29.760 --> 41:31.760
And it's adorable

41:31.760 --> 41:33.760
The Furrets are cute, considering they're the new Pidgeys

41:33.760 --> 41:35.760
And those things, the Centrets or whatever

41:35.760 --> 41:37.760
Are fucking everywhere

41:37.760 --> 41:39.760
And now I have all these Furrets

41:39.760 --> 41:41.760
The Furrets are adorable

41:41.760 --> 41:43.760
I just want to take a nap in a pile of Furrets

41:43.760 --> 41:45.760
You do want a Furret coat for Christmas?

41:45.760 --> 41:47.760
No!

41:47.760 --> 41:49.760
I want them to be alive and scribble

41:49.760 --> 41:51.760
I want them to be pets for reals

41:51.760 --> 41:53.760
But that's really been

41:53.760 --> 41:55.760
Oh yeah, Miitomo

41:55.760 --> 41:57.760
I'm still doing Miitomo

41:57.760 --> 41:59.760
I do realize though, some of the Gen 2 Pokemon

41:59.760 --> 42:01.760
Get really uncreative

42:01.760 --> 42:03.760
Like, there's a Pokemon called

42:03.760 --> 42:05.760
Pineco

42:05.760 --> 42:07.760
Do you know what it is?

42:07.760 --> 42:09.760
It's a fucking pinecone

42:09.760 --> 42:11.760
And his name is Pineco

42:11.760 --> 42:13.760
That I think is the prettiest one right now

42:13.760 --> 42:15.760
Is the Xatu

42:15.760 --> 42:17.760
Oh yeah, the evolved

42:17.760 --> 42:19.760
I caught one on its own

42:19.760 --> 42:21.760
But they're pretty

42:21.760 --> 42:23.760
Like, Mayan and Incan

42:23.760 --> 42:25.760
Design

42:25.760 --> 42:27.760
And I really like the design

42:27.760 --> 42:29.760
Some of the designs are really cool

42:29.760 --> 42:31.760
My watch told me to stand, so I'm standing

42:31.760 --> 42:33.760
Alright, you stand

42:33.760 --> 42:35.760
Catch a Pokemon with your watch

42:35.760 --> 42:37.760
I have been doing Pokemon Go with my Apple Watch

42:37.760 --> 42:39.760
And I have to talk about that a little bit

42:39.760 --> 42:41.760
Sure, go for it

42:41.760 --> 42:43.760
If you can't bust out your phone

42:43.760 --> 42:45.760
But you're going to go for a walk

42:45.760 --> 42:47.760
I don't know how this works on the Series 2

42:47.760 --> 42:49.760
It has the built-in GPS and everything

42:49.760 --> 42:51.760
But I find it really neat

42:51.760 --> 42:53.760
That when I'm doing my walk at work

42:53.760 --> 42:55.760
I just turn it on on my watch

42:55.760 --> 42:57.760
And it actually even has

42:57.760 --> 42:59.760
Kind of like how your little thing blinks

42:59.760 --> 43:01.760
You know, when there's Pokemon nearby

43:01.760 --> 43:03.760
It'll actually show me the list of them

43:03.760 --> 43:05.760
And let me pick which ones I want to catch

43:05.760 --> 43:07.760
It lets me hit the Pokestop as I'm walking around

43:07.760 --> 43:09.760
But the other thing too

43:09.760 --> 43:11.760
Is that the feedback that it gives

43:11.760 --> 43:13.760
For my walking for Pokemon

43:13.760 --> 43:15.760
Goes into my

43:15.760 --> 43:17.760
Workout ring

43:17.760 --> 43:19.760
Or close the rings challenge

43:19.760 --> 43:21.760
That's a big thing

43:21.760 --> 43:23.760
All over the place

43:23.760 --> 43:25.760
It applies to my

43:25.760 --> 43:27.760
Workout ring on my watch

43:27.760 --> 43:29.760
So

43:29.760 --> 43:31.760
I love the integration

43:31.760 --> 43:33.760
It's really fun

43:33.760 --> 43:35.760
Is that like Fitbit? Because when I play Pokemon Go

43:35.760 --> 43:37.760
I still get the credit on Fitbit

43:37.760 --> 43:41.760
I honestly think it's more accurate than Fitbit

43:41.760 --> 43:45.760
And I've read a lot of comparisons and things

43:45.760 --> 43:47.760
And they always are updating it with every OS

43:47.760 --> 43:49.760
I'm still on the iPhone 6 Plus

43:49.760 --> 43:51.760
And the big thing they added into that

43:51.760 --> 43:53.760
Was they put a Fitbit type thing in it

43:53.760 --> 43:55.760
So I know I'm getting crazy

43:55.760 --> 43:57.760
Same with the Success Plus

43:57.760 --> 43:59.760
Or Success, what I have

43:59.760 --> 44:01.760
But the watch will also monitor your heartbeat

44:01.760 --> 44:03.760
And so as you're walking

44:03.760 --> 44:05.760
It will put it into your whole

44:05.760 --> 44:07.760
Workout thing

44:07.760 --> 44:09.760
So every time your heart rate goes up

44:09.760 --> 44:11.760
It counts as workout time

44:11.760 --> 44:13.760
I have the weirdest question about the watch

44:13.760 --> 44:15.760
Does it work if you own two iPhones?

44:15.760 --> 44:17.760
Can it sync to both?

44:17.760 --> 44:19.760
Or no, you have to pick one

44:19.760 --> 44:21.760
You have to pick one, but you can do two watches

44:21.760 --> 44:23.760
For a phone

44:23.760 --> 44:25.760
But pairing, I mean, it takes like

44:25.760 --> 44:27.760
A minute

44:27.760 --> 44:29.760
It's only because

44:29.760 --> 44:31.760
Basically your data is stored on your phone

44:31.760 --> 44:33.760
And syncs to your watch

44:33.760 --> 44:35.760
Because the watch doesn't have that big of a capacity

44:35.760 --> 44:37.760
But I mean

44:37.760 --> 44:39.760
And if you get a series too

44:39.760 --> 44:41.760
Could you imagine swimming for your Pokemon walking?

44:41.760 --> 44:43.760
That would be pretty rad

44:43.760 --> 44:45.760
But yeah, I hadn't played a lot with it

44:45.760 --> 44:47.760
Until this past week

44:47.760 --> 44:49.760
And I was actually really

44:49.760 --> 44:51.760
Delighted by how it worked

44:51.760 --> 44:53.760
Very surprised, very delighted

44:53.760 --> 44:55.760
It just really

44:55.760 --> 44:57.760
Was uh

44:57.760 --> 44:59.760
It made it a lot more fun for me

44:59.760 --> 45:01.760
Because then I didn't have to stare at my

45:01.760 --> 45:03.760
Phone while I was going walking

45:03.760 --> 45:05.760
I could actually just leave it and go

45:05.760 --> 45:07.760
And it was really fun

45:07.760 --> 45:09.760
So it's like

45:09.760 --> 45:11.760
Having your little device

45:11.760 --> 45:13.760
What's it called?

45:13.760 --> 45:15.760
Yeah, it's like having that

45:15.760 --> 45:17.760
But more interactive

45:17.760 --> 45:19.760
And then you get the little thumps on your wrist

45:19.760 --> 45:21.760
When it finds stuff

45:21.760 --> 45:23.760
So that's cool, the whole haptic feedback

45:23.760 --> 45:25.760
So anyway, that's my mini review

45:25.760 --> 45:27.760
Of Pokemon Go on the Apple Watch

45:27.760 --> 45:29.760
Alright, there it is

45:29.760 --> 45:31.760
Moving on, Loki, how was your gaming week?

45:31.760 --> 45:33.760
I played lots of Skyrim

45:33.760 --> 45:35.760
As usual

45:35.760 --> 45:37.760
And then of course also played

45:37.760 --> 45:39.760
Until Dawn Rush of Blood

45:39.760 --> 45:41.760
Because I actually haven't played

45:41.760 --> 45:43.760
Too much of that

45:43.760 --> 45:45.760
I've been demonstrating it a lot for people

45:45.760 --> 45:47.760
But I actually went and decided to play

45:47.760 --> 45:49.760
Some of it myself

45:49.760 --> 45:51.760
And that game is still a lot of fun

45:51.760 --> 45:53.760
I really enjoy that game

45:53.760 --> 45:55.760
But it's kind of funny though

45:55.760 --> 45:57.760
Because everybody else that plays those games

45:57.760 --> 45:59.760
The first time they're jumping and everything

45:59.760 --> 46:01.760
And I'm just like fucking going to town

46:01.760 --> 46:03.760
Killing shit with my guns

46:03.760 --> 46:05.760
But I really do enjoy that game

46:05.760 --> 46:07.760
And I've also been getting lots of peer pressure

46:07.760 --> 46:09.760
To get Overwatch

46:09.760 --> 46:11.760
So I don't know if I'm going to do that though

46:11.760 --> 46:13.760
It's not really on sale too much right now

46:13.760 --> 46:15.760
It's like 17% off

46:15.760 --> 46:17.760
Or something like that on the

46:17.760 --> 46:19.760
Playstation Store

46:19.760 --> 46:21.760
But I don't know

46:21.760 --> 46:23.760
People want me to play it

46:23.760 --> 46:25.760
That's it

46:25.760 --> 46:27.760
Oh well, Pokemon Go actually

46:27.760 --> 46:29.760
I don't have the plus yet

46:29.760 --> 46:31.760
But I've been playing a little bit of Pokemon Go

46:31.760 --> 46:33.760
Mainly just enough to keep my

46:33.760 --> 46:35.760
Streaks going each day

46:35.760 --> 46:37.760
That's about it

46:37.760 --> 46:39.760
Honestly I'll turn on every once in a while

46:39.760 --> 46:41.760
Usually if I need items I'll go get that

46:41.760 --> 46:43.760
When I'm walking around midtown

46:43.760 --> 46:45.760
To catch stuff

46:45.760 --> 46:47.760
I just kind of look around to see if there's anything new

46:47.760 --> 46:49.760
I got one that looks like a cow

46:49.760 --> 46:51.760
Oh the milk tank?

46:51.760 --> 46:53.760
Or whatever it's called?

46:53.760 --> 46:55.760
Those are apparently pretty good

46:55.760 --> 46:57.760
I don't have one yet

46:57.760 --> 46:59.760
So I have one of those

46:59.760 --> 47:01.760
Yeah it's like the same shit

47:01.760 --> 47:03.760
It's like the same shit all over the place

47:03.760 --> 47:05.760
It's like okay well shit I've already got all those

47:05.760 --> 47:07.760
Like I don't want any more of that crow

47:07.760 --> 47:09.760
Witch thing

47:09.760 --> 47:11.760
There's too many of those

47:11.760 --> 47:13.760
And they don't evolve

47:13.760 --> 47:15.760
Yeah they're fucking useless

47:15.760 --> 47:17.760
They're only good to finally get

47:17.760 --> 47:19.760
The fucking dark trophy

47:19.760 --> 47:21.760
For catching dark types

47:21.760 --> 47:23.760
That's what it's good for, that's it

47:23.760 --> 47:25.760
Alright well I guess I'll do that then

47:25.760 --> 47:27.760
Yeah I don't know, just recycle it

47:27.760 --> 47:29.760
And JD points out it will evolve in Gen 4

47:29.760 --> 47:31.760
Oh okay let me just wait until 2020

47:31.760 --> 47:33.760
For that you know

47:33.760 --> 47:35.760
Save those candies

47:35.760 --> 47:37.760
Save those candies yeah

47:39.760 --> 47:41.760
Alright

47:41.760 --> 47:43.760
I have to check my demon hunter right now

47:43.760 --> 47:45.760
On Warcraft? Oh yeah cause the whole app and all that

47:45.760 --> 47:47.760
That's actually pretty nice

47:47.760 --> 47:49.760
I'll tell you what I haven't really played at all this week

47:49.760 --> 47:51.760
Ingress

47:51.760 --> 47:53.760
Because I'm finding

47:53.760 --> 47:55.760
Very little point to do that anymore

47:55.760 --> 47:57.760
I've been burned out too

47:57.760 --> 47:59.760
For me it's the fact that there's no

47:59.760 --> 48:01.760
Like the live event thing

48:01.760 --> 48:03.760
I know they're doing shards

48:03.760 --> 48:05.760
But it's not exciting for me

48:05.760 --> 48:07.760
I could give a shit about shards

48:07.760 --> 48:09.760
The shard thing is too limited I think

48:09.760 --> 48:11.760
And every time I hear shard I just think of shart

48:11.760 --> 48:13.760
It's appropriate

48:13.760 --> 48:15.760
Alright

48:15.760 --> 48:17.760
My gaming week

48:17.760 --> 48:19.760
So pretty much a lot of the same standbys

48:19.760 --> 48:21.760
I've been streaming some of it on my twitch channel

48:21.760 --> 48:23.760
Cheatplug, Rob Roberts on twitch

48:23.760 --> 48:25.760
Please please follow me if you aren't already

48:25.760 --> 48:27.760
I appreciate it, I've been really trying to grow

48:27.760 --> 48:29.760
Things over there on twitch

48:29.760 --> 48:31.760
And I've been doing more streaming

48:31.760 --> 48:33.760
A lot of the old same

48:33.760 --> 48:35.760
Standby stuff, Final Fantasy 14 and

48:35.760 --> 48:37.760
Overwatch which I'm still continuing to play this week

48:37.760 --> 48:39.760
Which by the way Loki, act deft and chat

48:39.760 --> 48:41.760
Over at live.vognetware.com

48:41.760 --> 48:43.760
It's practically screaming in caps, get Overwatch

48:43.760 --> 48:45.760
Loki, yes I know everybody wants me

48:45.760 --> 48:47.760
Everyone wants

48:47.760 --> 48:49.760
Me to get Overwatch

48:49.760 --> 48:51.760
A lot of people that I'm co-workers with

48:51.760 --> 48:53.760
They play on PC so

48:53.760 --> 48:55.760
My PC's not

48:55.760 --> 48:57.760
I don't think it's good enough to run Overwatch

48:57.760 --> 48:59.760
You might want to check

48:59.760 --> 49:01.760
Sometimes Blizzard's pretty good about making sure

49:01.760 --> 49:03.760
I need a new PC anyways

49:03.760 --> 49:05.760
I've been looking at getting either a new laptop

49:05.760 --> 49:07.760
Or a new desktop

49:07.760 --> 49:09.760
But the laptops are pretty decent for the price

49:09.760 --> 49:11.760
And now they have the new Ryzen chips that came out

49:11.760 --> 49:13.760
Which look pretty nice

49:13.760 --> 49:15.760
My out of date monster will run Overwatch

49:15.760 --> 49:17.760
So

49:17.760 --> 49:19.760
This probably will

49:19.760 --> 49:21.760
I don't know

49:21.760 --> 49:23.760
I would use controller though

49:23.760 --> 49:25.760
I guess I would lose that against keyboard mouse right?

49:25.760 --> 49:27.760
Probably

49:27.760 --> 49:29.760
Unless, well play a character

49:29.760 --> 49:31.760
Like Torbjorn or Symmetra where you can set up

49:31.760 --> 49:33.760
Like turrets and robots to do

49:33.760 --> 49:35.760
The things for you that might help

49:35.760 --> 49:37.760
Anyway, so I've been playing some Overwatch

49:37.760 --> 49:39.760
Then let's see I was continuing to play

49:39.760 --> 49:41.760
Skyrim HD which I talked about a little bit last week

49:41.760 --> 49:43.760
I was playing that a little more on

49:43.760 --> 49:45.760
Xbox One and still really

49:45.760 --> 49:47.760
Enjoy the graphics, like I'm like okay wow

49:47.760 --> 49:49.760
This game really does look good you know

49:49.760 --> 49:51.760
It makes me very excited for Elder Scrolls 6

49:51.760 --> 49:53.760
Which I hope they announce sooner rather than later

49:53.760 --> 49:55.760
Even though I think it's going to be a

49:55.760 --> 49:57.760
Fallout game this year

49:57.760 --> 49:59.760
Like a New Vegas 2 or something

49:59.760 --> 50:01.760
Another one? But they just did Fallout 4

50:01.760 --> 50:03.760
Fallout New Vegas 2 or whatever it is

50:03.760 --> 50:05.760
I think is what the rumors say for this year

50:05.760 --> 50:07.760
No

50:07.760 --> 50:09.760
We'll see, we'll see

50:09.760 --> 50:11.760
Other than that I did download a few new things

50:11.760 --> 50:13.760
I did not realize

50:13.760 --> 50:15.760
This was on Playstation 4

50:15.760 --> 50:17.760
But I think it just came out recently

50:17.760 --> 50:19.760
Which was a Chinese rooms

50:19.760 --> 50:21.760
Game that they did

50:21.760 --> 50:23.760
Before, it was only one of their first games

50:23.760 --> 50:25.760
It was the Half-Life mod that there was a

50:25.760 --> 50:27.760
Spinoff game before they did

50:27.760 --> 50:29.760
Everybody's Gone to the Rapture, which you know

50:29.760 --> 50:31.760
I loved that game, so the fact that

50:31.760 --> 50:33.760
It was only like, because they're doing a big sale

50:33.760 --> 50:35.760
On Playstation right now so it was only like 4 or 5 bucks

50:35.760 --> 50:37.760
For Dear Esther even though I think it's new

50:37.760 --> 50:39.760
On Playstation 4, it's not a new game at all

50:39.760 --> 50:41.760
It's been out for like 10 years, but I'd never played it

50:41.760 --> 50:43.760
So I wanted to get in there and play it

50:43.760 --> 50:45.760
And I didn't get super far in it

50:45.760 --> 50:47.760
I didn't really like talk about the story or anything yet

50:47.760 --> 50:49.760
But it is really pretty

50:49.760 --> 50:51.760
I mean, again, the fact that it's not on Playstation 4

50:51.760 --> 50:53.760
Like, you know, walking on these

50:53.760 --> 50:55.760
Barren cliffs

50:55.760 --> 50:57.760
By the ocean and this grey

50:57.760 --> 50:59.760
Very dreary setting

50:59.760 --> 51:01.760
It does look gorgeous

51:01.760 --> 51:03.760
For what it's worth, so I had fun with that

51:03.760 --> 51:05.760
And then another game I downloaded which I played a little more of

51:05.760 --> 51:07.760
Which I did enjoy

51:07.760 --> 51:09.760
Was this little game called Enter the Gungeon

51:09.760 --> 51:11.760
Which I played a little bit of, lowkey

51:11.760 --> 51:13.760
I saw that

51:13.760 --> 51:15.760
Did you see that when I was playing that?

51:15.760 --> 51:17.760
So that was fun, I liked that

51:17.760 --> 51:19.760
It's pretty much like a roguelike

51:19.760 --> 51:21.760
I guess

51:21.760 --> 51:23.760
But with guns, and yes you do

51:23.760 --> 51:25.760
You go through the dungeon, you find stronger guns

51:25.760 --> 51:27.760
To take on more bosses

51:27.760 --> 51:29.760
And find more guns

51:29.760 --> 51:31.760
And bosses based off guns

51:31.760 --> 51:33.760
So I didn't play a lot

51:33.760 --> 51:35.760
But I played enough, I played through the tutorial

51:35.760 --> 51:37.760
And then I was playing the beginning stage a little bit

51:37.760 --> 51:39.760
I got through at least the first floor

51:39.760 --> 51:41.760
And beat one of the bosses

51:41.760 --> 51:43.760
Which is kind of weird

51:43.760 --> 51:45.760
So yeah I was having fun with that

51:45.760 --> 51:47.760
And I didn't realize in the theme song

51:47.760 --> 51:49.760
To Enter the Gungeon, they actually have a whole custom thing

51:49.760 --> 51:51.760
Where they're actually singing about the Gungeon

51:51.760 --> 51:53.760
So that was a nice touch

51:53.760 --> 51:55.760
Props to them

51:55.760 --> 51:57.760
So I was enjoying that

51:57.760 --> 51:59.760
So that was pretty much my gaming week

51:59.760 --> 52:01.760
Alright

52:01.760 --> 52:03.760
I was getting into housekeeping here

52:03.760 --> 52:05.760
But there's not a lot to tell you

52:05.760 --> 52:07.760
Besides please follow us on Twitter

52:07.760 --> 52:09.760
We're also on Facebook

52:10.760 --> 52:12.760
And I do want to mention

52:12.760 --> 52:14.760
On Twitch TV

52:14.760 --> 52:16.760
We not only have our own channel on Twitch

52:16.760 --> 52:18.760
Which we haven't really been using a lot of recently

52:18.760 --> 52:20.760
Admittedly, but we are trying to build up the presence

52:20.760 --> 52:22.760
For VOG Network over on Twitch

52:22.760 --> 52:24.760
If you do follow VOG Network

52:24.760 --> 52:26.760
Over on Twitch

52:26.760 --> 52:28.760
Several of the hosts that do things here at VOG Network

52:28.760 --> 52:30.760
We auto host their feeds

52:30.760 --> 52:32.760
And at a later time we're hoping to bring you some content

52:32.760 --> 52:34.760
Original to the Twitch feed of VOG Network as well

52:34.760 --> 52:36.760
So check that out

52:36.760 --> 52:38.760
We were talking about that a little bit on last week's show

52:38.760 --> 52:40.760
And then Bobby went in and like

52:40.760 --> 52:42.760
Figured out how to get back in there

52:42.760 --> 52:44.760
And made sure it was up and running this week

52:44.760 --> 52:46.760
So he did all that, so thanks Bobby

52:46.760 --> 52:48.760
So check that out

52:48.760 --> 52:50.760
Let's get into some gaming news

52:50.760 --> 52:52.760
Lots more to cover, right Loki?

52:52.760 --> 52:54.760
Yep, and as I was talking about

52:54.760 --> 52:56.760
My gaming week this week I of course played

52:56.760 --> 52:58.760
Lots of the Playstation VR

52:58.760 --> 53:00.760
And apparently it's selling pretty well as well

53:00.760 --> 53:02.760
So they're also

53:02.760 --> 53:04.760
They have revealed that as of February 19th

53:04.760 --> 53:06.760
They've sold about

53:06.760 --> 53:08.760
915,000 units

53:08.760 --> 53:10.760
So they're actually

53:10.760 --> 53:12.760
Expected to hit their estimate

53:12.760 --> 53:14.760
Of about 1 million units by mid April

53:14.760 --> 53:16.760
Originally they were

53:16.760 --> 53:18.760
Forecasting 2.6 million units

53:18.760 --> 53:20.760
But of course they lowered that down to

53:20.760 --> 53:22.760
750,000 which they've

53:22.760 --> 53:24.760
Already exceeded, so

53:24.760 --> 53:26.760
Good for them, apparently that makes the

53:26.760 --> 53:28.760
Playstation VR the highest selling headset

53:28.760 --> 53:30.760
Of the three main contenders

53:30.760 --> 53:32.760
The Vive, Rift, and

53:32.760 --> 53:34.760
Gear VR

53:34.760 --> 53:36.760
Alright no I'm sorry

53:36.760 --> 53:38.760
It's actually the Vive and the Rift

53:38.760 --> 53:40.760
Including the Playstation VR

53:40.760 --> 53:42.760
The Gear VR is actually I think sold

53:42.760 --> 53:44.760
A little bit better

53:44.760 --> 53:46.760
So hopefully this bodes well for Sony actually

53:46.760 --> 53:48.760
Continuing to support it

53:48.760 --> 53:50.760
Because there was some of us worried that it could go down a path like the Vita

53:50.760 --> 53:52.760
I still think

53:52.760 --> 53:54.760
Just everybody show that stuff

53:54.760 --> 53:56.760
They get really

53:56.760 --> 53:58.760
Wowed by it

53:58.760 --> 54:00.760
So I still think it's just getting

54:00.760 --> 54:02.760
It in the people's faces basically

54:02.760 --> 54:04.760
To try it

54:04.760 --> 54:06.760
And once they've tried it

54:06.760 --> 54:08.760
I don't think I've ever had anyone go

54:08.760 --> 54:10.760
Oh that's dumb

54:10.760 --> 54:12.760
Or like this is never going to take off

54:12.760 --> 54:14.760
It's always been like holy shit

54:14.760 --> 54:16.760
Just amazing

54:16.760 --> 54:18.760
That this is

54:18.760 --> 54:20.760
Even a thing

54:20.760 --> 54:22.760
And so it's just getting people to try it

54:22.760 --> 54:24.760
And once they've tried it then they pretty much

54:24.760 --> 54:26.760
Become evangelists for it

54:26.760 --> 54:28.760
I don't know if you guys know

54:28.760 --> 54:30.760
But I never did end up getting one

54:30.760 --> 54:32.760
For Pro which in retrospect

54:32.760 --> 54:34.760
Was probably the wrong decision to be honest

54:34.760 --> 54:36.760
But it's okay

54:36.760 --> 54:38.760
I own it

54:38.760 --> 54:40.760
Well I don't know

54:40.760 --> 54:42.760
I don't know if I'd be using the Playstation VR

54:42.760 --> 54:44.760
The whole time if I owned it

54:44.760 --> 54:46.760
Do you use it regularly?

54:46.760 --> 54:48.760
I have been recently using it more often

54:48.760 --> 54:50.760
I haven't really been playing VR games in it

54:50.760 --> 54:52.760
But I'm always like whenever they have sales

54:52.760 --> 54:54.760
And stuff I'm always looking to see what games are on sale

54:54.760 --> 54:56.760
And I do have some in my backlog

54:56.760 --> 54:58.760
That I get to play

54:58.760 --> 55:00.760
It's funny actually the other day

55:00.760 --> 55:02.760
I was looking through my catalog of stuff

55:02.760 --> 55:04.760
I'm like man I thought I had more games than this

55:04.760 --> 55:06.760
And then I looked and I'm like

55:06.760 --> 55:08.760
Oh wait that's stuff that's been downloaded

55:08.760 --> 55:10.760
And I'm like 187 games

55:10.760 --> 55:12.760
Holy shit

55:12.760 --> 55:14.760
My Playstation library is looking just like

55:14.760 --> 55:16.760
My Steam library

55:16.760 --> 55:18.760
But yeah there's like

55:18.760 --> 55:20.760
Oh I bought Need for Speed

55:20.760 --> 55:22.760
And Dragon Age Inquisition

55:22.760 --> 55:24.760
When the fuck did that happen?

55:24.760 --> 55:26.760
Silly stuff

55:27.760 --> 55:29.760
Not really a game I would play

55:29.760 --> 55:31.760
But I definitely want to try it in VR

55:31.760 --> 55:33.760
I played for just a little bit this week

55:33.760 --> 55:35.760
I played Rez

55:35.760 --> 55:37.760
The new one that came out

55:37.760 --> 55:39.760
The reimagining for the second time

55:39.760 --> 55:41.760
But I don't have Playstation VR

55:41.760 --> 55:43.760
I've just been playing it on the TV

55:43.760 --> 55:45.760
And I still love it

55:45.760 --> 55:47.760
I do kind of

55:47.760 --> 55:49.760
If I had a VR thing I would like to play this

55:49.760 --> 55:51.760
God so many cords everywhere

55:51.760 --> 55:53.760
With that VR headset

55:53.760 --> 55:55.760
My house is already a mess

55:55.760 --> 55:57.760
I mean really

55:57.760 --> 55:59.760
Because you just have the one that combines

55:59.760 --> 56:01.760
The HDMI and whatever

56:01.760 --> 56:03.760
That other thing

56:03.760 --> 56:05.760
So it's basically

56:05.760 --> 56:07.760
Just that and then everything plugs into it

56:07.760 --> 56:09.760
I mean yeah you can kind of twist it up

56:09.760 --> 56:11.760
And stuff but

56:11.760 --> 56:13.760
Just don't be stupid don't spin around circles

56:13.760 --> 56:15.760
Like my son does

56:15.760 --> 56:17.760
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says the PSVR has

56:17.760 --> 56:19.760
Almost sold as much as Eye of Judgment

56:19.760 --> 56:21.760
No Eye of Judgment

56:21.760 --> 56:23.760
Will never sell that

56:23.760 --> 56:25.760
Eye of Judgment is dead

56:25.760 --> 56:27.760
It's gone

56:27.760 --> 56:29.760
That bet is never happening

56:29.760 --> 56:31.760
They stopped making them

56:31.760 --> 56:33.760
It's over

56:33.760 --> 56:35.760
They didn't make a million of them

56:35.760 --> 56:37.760
Unless you could always hope

56:37.760 --> 56:39.760
Now here's what you have to do

56:39.760 --> 56:41.760
Here's what y'all have to hope for if you want Loki in the tingle outfit

56:41.760 --> 56:43.760
You need

56:43.760 --> 56:45.760
And for those that are newer to OLR

56:45.760 --> 56:47.760
And don't understand what this joke is

56:47.760 --> 56:49.760
When the Eye of Judgment

56:49.760 --> 56:51.760
The Playstation 3

56:51.760 --> 56:53.760
There was this game that they were doing

56:53.760 --> 56:55.760
With a game

56:55.760 --> 56:57.760
It was an augmented reality card game

56:57.760 --> 56:59.760
And it was dumb because you played an actual card game

56:59.760 --> 57:01.760
And all it did was

57:01.760 --> 57:03.760
Change the graphics on the TV

57:03.760 --> 57:05.760
And it was like

57:05.760 --> 57:07.760
Wasn't it expensive too?

57:07.760 --> 57:09.760
It was just not a very well thought out idea

57:09.760 --> 57:11.760
I mean I'm sure the game

57:11.760 --> 57:13.760
We went and saw the demo

57:13.760 --> 57:15.760
At E3 and I was just like

57:15.760 --> 57:17.760
I don't see the point

57:17.760 --> 57:19.760
Somebody didn't really think this through

57:19.760 --> 57:21.760
Somebody was like

57:21.760 --> 57:23.760
It's the Ryan Reynolds picture

57:23.760 --> 57:25.760
But why?

57:25.760 --> 57:27.760
But you jump to conclusions

57:27.760 --> 57:29.760
But why?

57:29.760 --> 57:31.760
So anyway

57:31.760 --> 57:33.760
The whole bet was

57:33.760 --> 57:35.760
That if they would sell

57:35.760 --> 57:37.760
And Loki was like it's never gonna sell

57:37.760 --> 57:39.760
So I don't even know how it happened

57:39.760 --> 57:41.760
But Loki made a bet and said look

57:41.760 --> 57:43.760
If the Eye of Judgment sells a million copies

57:43.760 --> 57:45.760
I will come to the show dressed as Tingle

57:45.760 --> 57:47.760
From the Legend of Zelda singles

57:47.760 --> 57:49.760
It was a talk like Tingle

57:49.760 --> 57:51.760
I don't know what the hell the thing was

57:51.760 --> 57:53.760
Well at the time we were on camera

57:53.760 --> 57:55.760
We were on Justin TV at the time

57:55.760 --> 57:57.760
And so you would do your little dance on camera

57:57.760 --> 57:59.760
And we'd all have a good laugh

57:59.760 --> 58:01.760
But you knew in the back of your mind that's never gonna fucking happen

58:01.760 --> 58:03.760
No it's never gonna happen

58:03.760 --> 58:05.760
It was a safe bet

58:05.760 --> 58:07.760
It's garbage

58:07.760 --> 58:09.760
So here's what you all need to hope for

58:09.760 --> 58:11.760
If you want Loki to ever dress up as Tingle

58:11.760 --> 58:13.760
Which just isn't gonna happen at this point

58:13.760 --> 58:15.760
And Sony does this sometimes

58:15.760 --> 58:17.760
For a new piece of technology

58:17.760 --> 58:19.760
Cause Sony does this right

58:19.760 --> 58:21.760
Sony said they do the

58:21.760 --> 58:23.760
With the Playstation

58:23.760 --> 58:25.760
Their online magazine thing

58:25.760 --> 58:27.760
They reclaim the name or something

58:27.760 --> 58:29.760
So sometimes Sony will reclaim names

58:29.760 --> 58:31.760
And use them for other things

58:31.760 --> 58:33.760
So maybe they'll bring back Eye of Judgment

58:33.760 --> 58:35.760
And it's like a new game

58:35.760 --> 58:37.760
Or it's a new something

58:37.760 --> 58:39.760
Like something in virtual reality

58:39.760 --> 58:41.760
And it's fucking awesome and sells ten million copies

58:41.760 --> 58:43.760
Now we can sit here and say Loki

58:44.760 --> 58:46.760
That's not the same Eye of Judgment though

58:48.760 --> 58:50.760
Cause someone can make a game called

58:50.760 --> 58:52.760
The Eye of Judgment

58:52.760 --> 58:54.760
Like a free to play game

58:54.760 --> 58:56.760
I don't know like a one penny game

58:56.760 --> 58:58.760
And they'll sell it and say ha ha

58:58.760 --> 59:00.760
See they sold a million copies

59:00.760 --> 59:02.760
No but the bet was Sony has to sell

59:02.760 --> 59:04.760
A million copies of the Eye of Judgment

59:04.760 --> 59:06.760
Anyhow

59:06.760 --> 59:08.760
Not gonna happen

59:08.760 --> 59:10.760
Let's see

59:10.760 --> 59:12.760
Bobby Blackwolf pointing out

59:13.760 --> 59:15.760
That's right

59:15.760 --> 59:17.760
And I think all these years later

59:17.760 --> 59:19.760
Bobby was very protective of the secrets

59:19.760 --> 59:21.760
But I think I'm safe to tell you

59:21.760 --> 59:23.760
If you never found Loki and Flappy Vog

59:23.760 --> 59:25.760
As Tingle, it's in there

59:25.760 --> 59:27.760
And you need to play more

59:27.760 --> 59:29.760
I'll leave you with that

59:29.760 --> 59:31.760
If Bobby wants to just yell it in chat

59:31.760 --> 59:33.760
If you play enough of Loki

59:33.760 --> 59:35.760
In Flappy Vog

59:35.760 --> 59:37.760
Eventually you'll get Loki as Tingle

59:37.760 --> 59:39.760
Yes it was an embarrassing part of my life

59:39.760 --> 59:41.760
But it's hilarious actually

59:41.760 --> 59:43.760
I recorded that

59:43.760 --> 59:45.760
I recorded that in my car

59:45.760 --> 59:47.760
Off my laptop in the rain

59:47.760 --> 59:49.760
In the parking lot of my work

59:49.760 --> 59:51.760
Because there is no quiet place

59:51.760 --> 59:53.760
To make those noises

59:53.760 --> 59:55.760
At my place of employment

59:55.760 --> 59:57.760
Without

59:57.760 --> 59:59.760
Embarrassing myself

59:59.760 --> 01:00:01.760
He does the voices you guys

01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:03.760
It's worth revisiting Flappy Vog

01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:05.760
This week and checking that out if you never saw that

01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:07.760
Alright anyway

01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:09.760
Let's move on

01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:11.760
Register participation for this week's episode of

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:13.760
Orange Laundry Radio at vognetwork.com

01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:15.760
Use the passphrase, inch

01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:17.760
ActDeft in chat points out

01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:19.760
It was kind of random

01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:21.760
Alright anyway let's talk about speaking of random

01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:23.760
Fallout Fantasy 15 has been getting

01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:25.760
Updates here and there and they finally released

01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:27.760
What like a booster pack this week

01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:29.760
Patch 1.05

01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:31.760
Released this week which

01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:33.760
Supports this new booster pack which has

01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:35.760
Some items for fishing

01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:37.760
All I know is it tried to download the update on my system

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:39.760
I don't have enough hard drive space for that

01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:41.760
Oh gosh is it really that big of a

01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:43.760
Hell no must have been

01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:45.760
Well anyway there is a new level cap

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:47.760
For your characters you can go up to 125

01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:49.760
In levels you can also store

01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:51.760
200 Prompto pictures now

01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:53.760
And there is also an MP3 player

01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:55.760
For Noctis when you are riding on a

01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:57.760
Chocobo which you didn't have before

01:00:57.760 --> 01:00:59.760
But also the 1.05 update

01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:01.760
Is the long awaited

01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:03.760
PlayStation 4 patch

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:05.760
Which will allow the frame rate

01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:07.760
To go up to a maximum of 60 frames a second

01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:09.760
On a PlayStation Pro

01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:11.760
I'm a PlayStation 4 Pro

01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:13.760
Owner and let me tell you

01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:15.760
I haven't noticed a difference

01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:17.760
Playing Fallout Fantasy 15 under this new patch

01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:19.760
Granted I didn't do a lot

01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:21.760
But when I did play

01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:23.760
I didn't notice a difference

01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:25.760
So good job on that investment

01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:27.760
Rob PlayStation 4 Pro

01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:29.760
Anyway

01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:31.760
Some users out there on the internet

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:33.760
Noticing that some of the frame rates

01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:35.760
And the transition between different frame rates

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:37.760
Is pretty jarring

01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:39.760
So I guess

01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:41.760
Maybe I'm not playing in the right mode

01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:43.760
Do I need to actually go into the high mode

01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:45.760
Maybe that's why I didn't do right

01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:47.760
So maybe I'll go back

01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:49.760
And tinker with that a little bit

01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:51.760
Just to see if I can get the game to

01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:53.760
Look even prettier but

01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:55.760
It looked good enough for what it's worth

01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:57.760
Anyway

01:01:57.760 --> 01:01:59.760
I guess near playlists were added

01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:01.760
To the game too

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:03.760
As you're driving around you can actually listen to the soundtracks

01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:05.760
Near if you want to hear that

01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:07.760
Sure cool

01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:09.760
Alright

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:11.760
How about the DLC with Gladio and all that stuff

01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:13.760
That's what I'm really waiting for

01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:15.760
Cup noodle

01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:17.760
Yeah my cup noodle hat where's that

01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:19.760
Can't wait for that

01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:21.760
Moving on Dark Sakura

01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:23.760
What do you have for us

01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:25.760
I have stuff

01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:27.760
Very sad stuff

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:29.760
A moment of silence if you will

01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:31.760
Alan Stone who was the co-founder

01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:33.760
Of Nintendo of America

01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:35.760
Died

01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:37.760
It was reported on February 23

01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:39.760
He died at

01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:41.760
71 from cancer

01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:43.760
71 is still a decent run

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:45.760
But still you know

01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:47.760
With current life spans that is

01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:49.760
A little short still

01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:51.760
He was

01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:53.760
One of the people behind getting

01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:55.760
You know the original Mario Brothers

01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:57.760
And Donkey Kong

01:02:57.760 --> 01:02:59.760
To be as popular as it was

01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:01.760
Over here and so we actually

01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:03.760
I would even say oh the

01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:05.760
Resurgence of video gaming in America

01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:07.760
To him so

01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:09.760
RIP

01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:11.760
People probably don't remember that

01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:13.760
You know there was a lot of stores out there

01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:15.760
That were really tepid

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:17.760
On stocking Nintendo

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:19.760
And Sega after

01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:21.760
The huge video game crash and you know

01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:23.760
Nintendo of America had to work very hard

01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:25.760
To make Nintendo

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:27.760
A success in this country which they did

01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:29.760
So yeah I think

01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:31.760
We owe a lot to

01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:33.760
You know what Alan Stone

01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:35.760
Did and fuck cancer etc

01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:37.760
Indeed

01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:39.760
It's

01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:41.760
Also I don't know was he still involved

01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:43.760
With Nintendo in later years

01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:45.760
Or probably not

01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:47.760
Because I was going to say it really kind of sucks

01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:49.760
Here we are a week before the Switch releases

01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:51.760
I'm pretty sure he would have been excited to see that

01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:53.760
But he probably had moved on from Nintendo

01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:55.760
Later in his career as you know people come

01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:57.760
And go from jobs all the time in different companies

01:03:57.760 --> 01:03:59.760
So but anyway a tip

01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:01.760
Of the hat there for Alan Stone

01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:03.760
And thank you

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:05.760
For everything you did to set up Nintendo

01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:07.760
In America

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:09.760
Loki let's change the subject

01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:11.760
Something a little brighter please

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:13.760
Yes definitely a little bit brighter because

01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:15.760
We're going to be talking about sunset overdrive

01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:17.760
And that was a pretty bright game

01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:19.760
Yes it was it was a very fluorescent game

01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:21.760
So you know

01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:23.760
It didn't do as well as Microsoft had hoped

01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:25.760
But

01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:27.760
They're saying that they still may continue on

01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:29.760
Even without Microsoft

01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:31.760
So

01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:33.760
You know basically you know the president

01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:35.760
Of Insomniac Ted Price

01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:37.760
Said that while there hasn't been any movement

01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:39.760
On a sequel you'd you know

01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:41.760
Have asked Microsoft about that

01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:43.760
But we're passionate about the franchise

01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:45.760
And we own it so you may see more

01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:47.760
Sunset in the future from us

01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:49.760
No promises and no timeline

01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:51.760
To speak of but it's something

01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:53.760
That represents our willingness to create

01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:55.760
Unexpected experiences

01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:57.760
And of course they're working on the new Spider-Man

01:04:57.760 --> 01:04:59.760
Right now

01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:01.760
I would be totally down for cross-platform

01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:03.760
Sunset overdrive game or hey

01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:05.760
Sony exclusive

01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:07.760
Sunset overdrive game

01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:09.760
Oh yeah I know

01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:11.760
I know people that really enjoyed sunset overdrive

01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:13.760
I didn't I didn't get into it

01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:15.760
I kind of tried to play it but I really didn't

01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:17.760
Get into it the way I think a lot of people did

01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:19.760
But I know there's a lot of people who'd be very happy

01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:21.760
To see them kind of continue it because

01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:23.760
I don't think it sold to the expectations

01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:25.760
That Microsoft had I mean Microsoft

01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:27.760
Gave it away during one of those games with gold

01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:29.760
Promotions at one point so

01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:31.760
You know I don't think it quite had the sales that

01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:33.760
They'd hoped for but yet NAC

01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:35.760
Still hasn't been given away yet

01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:37.760
That's you know what that's a good point and NAC is getting a

01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:39.760
Sequel you know what that's a darn good point so if NAC

01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:41.760
Can get a fucking sequel why can't sunset overdrive

01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:43.760
Get a sequel alright that's well put

01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:45.760
Loki well put

01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:47.760
Alright

01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:49.760
Let's move on I know a lot of you are fans

01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:51.760
Of Jim Sterling over on YouTube

01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:53.760
You're one of them right Loki? Yes I am

01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:55.760
You like to watch this well you're probably happy to hear this

01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:57.760
I'm very aware of the situation yeah

01:05:57.760 --> 01:05:59.760
So you probably know more about this than I do

01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:01.760
Apparently what happened the case dismissed

01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:03.760
This week with

01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:05.760
Jim Sterling fighting with Digital Homicide

01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:07.760
This was where Digital Homicide

01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:09.760
Did what basically come out and said that

01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:11.760
He

01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:13.760
Basically was what slander was that what it was about?

01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:15.760
It was a whole bunch of stuff so he had done

01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:17.760
A bunch he does a series called

01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:19.760
Best of Scene Greenlight where he'll show

01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:21.760
Off games that are just garbage

01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:23.760
And he'll like make fun of them

01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:25.760
And then he also does you know like a let's play

01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:27.760
Series that he does with

01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:29.760
Different games like that and one of the games he showed

01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:31.760
Was the Slaughtering Grounds which was this

01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:33.760
Like you know very

01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:35.760
Basic first person shooter game that

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:37.760
Used a bunch of pre-bought assets from the Unity

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:39.760
Store and didn't really do anything

01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:41.760
And so he just you know

01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:43.760
Called it like an asset flip and so

01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:45.760
Then James Romain

01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:47.760
Who was part of

01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:49.760
Digital Homicide

01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:51.760
Came out with a video slamming

01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:53.760
Him on his review of the game

01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:55.760
To which you know he's like this isn't a review

01:06:55.760 --> 01:06:57.760
It's a let's play and then

01:06:57.760 --> 01:06:59.760
So he decided to do a

01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:01.760
Review of a review

01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:03.760
And like did that and I think it even

01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:05.760
Went another step further but

01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:07.760
It came down to like they were saying that he

01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:09.760
You know was

01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:11.760
Slandering them and he caused them

01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:13.760
Financial harm and they were trying to sue him for like

01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:15.760
Ten million dollars when in reality he

01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:17.760
Probably brought more publicity to their game

01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:19.760
Right and then they would have had otherwise

01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:21.760
These guys weren't exactly right in the head

01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:23.760
Anyways let me get in the heat like

01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:25.760
Allegedly don't sue us

01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:27.760
He um you know

01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:29.760
Also like did like an interview with him and stuff

01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:31.760
And it was just it was

01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:33.760
Cringy but so to make a

01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:35.760
Long story short he went this

01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:37.760
Went you know they pursued him

01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:39.760
You know sued him and he got

01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:41.760
A dismiss with prejudice so he's

01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:43.760
Um you know

01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:45.760
Free to do whatever on this he's supposed to make

01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:47.760
Like a video about it on Monday

01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:49.760
Actually regarding this dismissal

01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:51.760
Um but yeah I mean these are the same guys

01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:53.760
That try to sue steam reviews

01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:55.760
You know sue people like

01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:57.760
To find you know who's

01:07:57.760 --> 01:07:59.760
Leaving bad reviews on their game so they can go off

01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:01.760
Through them monetarily and then

01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:03.760
Then steam of course pulled their games off of

01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:05.760
You know

01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:07.760
Here's the thing that I think kind of sucks about this

01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:09.760
Is that you know there's the whole you can read

01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:11.760
The motion for dismissal it's all public and online

01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:13.760
Both parties have to

01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:15.760
Bear their own attorney and filing fees

01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:17.760
So that means he

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:19.760
Jim Sterling still had to pay for the attorney

01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:21.760
And the filing which he shouldn't have to do that

01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:23.760
No he shouldn't the other parties should have to pay for that

01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:25.760
Here's the thing the reason the thought

01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:27.760
Well the thought of it is

01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:29.760
That it was more of like

01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:31.760
Jim Sterling being nice about it because

01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:33.760
He could have pursued it

01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:35.760
Further to get those attorney fees but he's just kind of like

01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:37.760
Fuck this I just want to be done with them

01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:39.760
Using the YouTube

01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:41.760
Ad revenue from the videos about it to pay for it

01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:43.760
Well it's just like he just wants to be done with them

01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:45.760
I think because he had a

01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:47.760
Strong case to where he could have gotten damages

01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:49.760
From them but it's more of just let's just

01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:51.760
Forget about it you know let's just

01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:53.760
Leave it and I'm just

01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:55.760
Going to still make fun of you but you know

01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:57.760
There's not much you can do about it

01:08:57.760 --> 01:08:59.760
So you know basically now they just said

01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:01.760
Any time that they

01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:03.760
They're not allowed to you know file

01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:05.760
Complaints regarding this of course

01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:07.760
If they do file any additional complaints not

01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:09.760
Documented in there they have to make sure

01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:11.760
That they're considering fair use and

01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:13.760
Some other thing I don't remember

01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:15.760
The exact

01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:17.760
Wording of it but yeah

01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:19.760
I mean that's kind of what's been going on

01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:21.760
It's been going on for a few months

01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:23.760
Now I think

01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:25.760
Geez

01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:27.760
Alright well I think this is interesting too

01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:29.760
I didn't realize this in order to file

01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:31.760
A lawsuit in Arizona the guy

01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:33.760
Contributed to the

01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:35.760
Patreon a dollar a month to

01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:37.760
Say that he does business in Arizona in order to

01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:39.760
File the lawsuit there

01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:41.760
It's shady shit

01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:43.760
That is shady as fuck

01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:45.760
Well be careful if you set up one of those

01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:47.760
Patreons because I know a lot of people are setting

01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:49.760
Those up but there's another great reason

01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:51.760
Why OLR hasn't exactly

01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:53.760
Jumped in on Patreon yet you know

01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:55.760
Legal things like that

01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:57.760
So anyway I don't have the fucking money

01:09:57.760 --> 01:09:59.760
To pay a lawyer like

01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:01.760
Anyway

01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:03.760
Let's move on

01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:05.760
People need to

01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:07.760
Just stop suing everybody over stupid things

01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:09.760
Y'all need Jesus

01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:11.760
Or whatever

01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:13.760
Y'all need

01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:15.760
A lobotomy

01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:17.760
Moving on

01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:19.760
Y'all need to go outside right Darsyra

01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:21.760
Yeah go outside and play some Pokemon Go

01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:23.760
Well as

01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:25.760
We know or may

01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:27.760
Have known and forgotten

01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:29.760
Or did not give a shit about

01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:31.760
Pokemon's 21st anniversary

01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:33.760
Is coming up so Niantic

01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:35.760
Is doing

01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:37.760
An event from February 26th

01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:39.760
Until March 6th

01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:41.760
For the anniversary

01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:43.760
It's going to be Pokemon day

01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:45.760
Or in that case Pokemon week

01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:47.760
Where you can

01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:49.760
Catch a special Pikachu

01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:51.760
He'll be wearing a party hat

01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:53.760
Just like the Santa Pikachus

01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:55.760
And so I am going to be

01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:57.760
Going on a Pikachu hunt

01:10:57.760 --> 01:10:59.760
I'm just going to hang out in the park by your house

01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:01.760
And hunt Pikachu

01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:03.760
Yeah I'll have to get one of those

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:05.760
So I can have all the different Pikachu hats

01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:07.760
It's all about hats

01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:09.760
I have the um

01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:11.760
Both the Christmas Pikachu and Raichu

01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:13.760
And I want the party hat Pikachu and Raichu

01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:15.760
Instead of Raichu there but I would assume Raichu would

01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:17.760
Yeah if it's like the Santa hats

01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:19.760
Then you should be able to evolve a Pikachu

01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:21.760
With a party hat and get a Raichu with a party hat

01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:23.760
Party too

01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:25.760
But that's really it

01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:27.760
I'm excited to catch a party too

01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:29.760
Will they spawn more Pikachu so you have a better chance to catch them

01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:31.760
Or are you going to have to find

01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:33.760
I don't see anything about that

01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:35.760
Well here's a pro tip there is some Pikachu nests

01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:37.760
Up in Sacramento so you just have to look at

01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:39.760
I missed my Porygon chance

01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:41.760
You did miss your Porygon chance

01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:43.760
They were all over during the Valentine day event

01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:45.760
Well I'll just do it next year

01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:47.760
That's what they all say

01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:49.760
Alright

01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:51.760
He's saying in his best Adore Delano voice

01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:53.760
Party

01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:55.760
Party

01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:57.760
Loki what do you have for us before we get to the classic game of the week

01:11:57.760 --> 01:11:59.760
So apparently now you have

01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:01.760
The ability through Twitch to

01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:03.760
Change your name

01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:05.760
Now changing your username

01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:07.760
Also not only does it change your name

01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:09.760
That everyone can view it

01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:11.760
It also changes your channels URL

01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:13.760
Of course

01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:15.760
They're saying that your old URL won't

01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:17.760
Redirect to the new one

01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:19.760
And then you can use that feature

01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:21.760
Once every 60 days

01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:23.760
And of course you can only change

01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:25.760
The name that's available

01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:27.760
I never realized

01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:29.760
That you could not change your Twitch name

01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:31.760
This seems like one of those

01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:33.760
Really obvious things

01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:35.760
That I wonder why it wasn't in place before

01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:37.760
But okay

01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:39.760
Well I know

01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:41.760
In the past certain things have been tied

01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:43.760
To actual names on the accounts

01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:45.760
Like an account number

01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:47.760
And so if they

01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:49.760
Made that change

01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:51.760
Where they assigned account numbers to everything

01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:53.760
Then they could do that

01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:55.760
Because that was like

01:12:55.760 --> 01:12:57.760
I think Sony

01:12:57.760 --> 01:12:59.760
Can you change your name on the

01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:01.760
Playstation now

01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:03.760
No and that's a very

01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:05.760
That's a thing that some people have problems with

01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:07.760
I thought that was something they were working on

01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:09.760
So I think that's the same process

01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:11.760
They have to assign your account a number

01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:13.760
And once they have everybody to a number

01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:15.760
They can go and allow you to

01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:17.760
Change those names

01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:21.760
Alright

01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:23.760
So if I want to change my name to Mob Moberts

01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:25.760
I can do that now

01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:27.760
Yes, as long as it's not taken

01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:29.760
As long as it's not already taken

01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:31.760
Don't take it or I'll sue you like that guy

01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:33.760
Alright let's talk about this

01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:35.760
Before we get into the classic game of the week

01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:37.760
And it has to do with Unity

01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:39.760
The Unity game engine is

01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:41.760
Being used for more than just games

01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:43.760
There's other things that are using it

01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:45.760
In fact there's a brand new French

01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:47.760
Animation show called Mr. Carton

01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:49.760
That is now the first

01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:51.760
Cartoon TV series

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:53.760
Made in Unity

01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:55.760
So now you can make a television cartoon

01:13:55.760 --> 01:13:57.760
In Unity, which makes me think

01:13:57.760 --> 01:13:59.760
How easy would it be to port that cartoon to other devices

01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:01.760
Through Unity

01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:03.760
Which also makes me think

01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:05.760
Remember when the 3DS was going to get movies

01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:07.760
Whatever happened to that?

01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:09.760
What happened to Tron or Tangled

01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:11.760
In 3D on the DS, what happened to that?

01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:13.760
Instead we got Dinosaur Office

01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:15.760
Look at Tekken, the Tekken movie was in

01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:17.760
Was the Tekken movie out?

01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:19.760
Because I think if there was a version of Tekken

01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:21.760
On the 3DS

01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:23.760
That actually had that movie

01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:25.760
Bundled with it

01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:27.760
I was going to say

01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:29.760
This is something that they've been pushing with Unity

01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:31.760
Because they had that whole tech demo

01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:33.760
I don't know if it was just for Unity 5

01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:35.760
Or whatever the version of Unity was

01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:37.760
But they had this big cinematic

01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:39.760
Thing that they put out

01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:41.760
And they were saying

01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:43.760
Yeah, you could use it for making movies

01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:45.760
Yeah, Mr. Carton

01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:47.760
Has a 13 episode season that is

01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:49.760
Premiering on France

01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:51.760
Televisions this week

01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:53.760
There's also, I guess 6 episodes have already

01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:55.760
Aired and you can actually go check it out on YouTube

01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:57.760
If you want, they're just short little

01:14:57.760 --> 01:14:59.760
2 minute adventures

01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:01.760
And I guess the language barrier

01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:03.760
Doesn't really prevent you from enjoying it

01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:05.760
Because the cartoon doesn't say much

01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:07.760
So you can still kind of enjoy it there

01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:09.760
I didn't watch it myself to be honest

01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:11.760
But maybe I will knowing that

01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:13.760
I don't need to know a lot of French to be able to understand it

01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:15.760
The creator of Mr. Carton

01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:17.760
Found Unity to be very suitable

01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:19.760
For the process saying that sequencing was a lot less

01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:21.760
Challenging in Unity than it is

01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:23.760
With more traditional methods

01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:25.760
Storyboarding and mastering were handled with other applications

01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:27.760
But set building, lighting

01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:29.760
Rendering and so forth

01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:31.760
Was done with Unity

01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:33.760
So that's pretty cool

01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:35.760
A cartoon

01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:37.760
All out of Unity

01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:39.760
Alright, let's go back to a simpler time

01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:41.760
When you can just

01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:43.760
Program your own game

01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:45.760
You can just create any game you wanted

01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:47.760
Unless it was like pinball construction

01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:49.760
Set or something

01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:51.760
It's the classic game of the week

01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:53.760
Where Dark Soccer is going to step into the gaming vault

01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:55.760
And find a game that she thinks

01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:57.760
Hey, you brat

01:15:57.760 --> 01:15:59.760
Enough with your newfangled

01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:01.760
Switches

01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:03.760
I'll show you a switch

01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:05.760
Nipple clips

01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:07.760
You'll go out to the yard and pick your own

01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:09.760
Which is psychological warfare

01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:11.760
Believe me

01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:13.760
Dark Sakura

01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:15.760
What is the classic game of the week

01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:17.760
That the kids should be reading about and playing

01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:19.760
The game is Crazy Chase

01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:21.760
Or as we had it in the US

01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:23.760
Casey's Crazy Chase

01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:25.760
Who remembers when I did

01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:27.760
Casey Munchkin a while back?

01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:29.760
Not me

01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:31.760
No, actually I thought you had already done this game

01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:33.760
Because you did do Casey Munchkin

01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:35.760
And I forgot they were different games

01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:37.760
I have to talk about a slight bit

01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:39.760
Because there was a big

01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:41.760
Casey Munchkin was sued

01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:43.760
Well, I'd say Phillips was sued

01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:45.760
By Atari

01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:47.760
Phillips Magnavox

01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:49.760
Because Casey

01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:51.760
While they didn't advertise

01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:53.760
That Casey Munchkin was

01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:55.760
Like Pac-Man

01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:57.760
In fact, they were very clear not to say it

01:16:57.760 --> 01:16:59.760
So many other people drew the comparison

01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:01.760
And were advertising it

01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:03.760
That way in catalogs

01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:05.760
Even though they said don't do it

01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:07.760
That they got sued

01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:09.760
By Atari

01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:11.760
Because Atari at that point had the home license

01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:13.760
For Pac-Man

01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:15.760
They

01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:17.760
Magnavox won the first suit

01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:19.760
But Atari

01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:21.760
Appealed and won the

01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:23.760
Second court case

01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:25.760
So that's that whole drama

01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:27.760
In a nutshell

01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:29.760
Casey Crazy Chase was a

01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:31.760
Sequel and a response

01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:33.760
And of course anything that has

01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:35.760
The Casey name in it

01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:37.760
Comes from the

01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:39.760
Phillips electronic president

01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:41.760
At the time, Casey Mencken

01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:43.760
So, there you go

01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:45.760
But this game is a sequel to Casey Munchkin

01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:47.760
In this game, it is still a map game

01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:49.760
And it actually does have

01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:51.760
A lot of the features of Casey Munchkin

01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:53.760
They came out

01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:55.760
In, let's see

01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:57.760
In the UK on the

01:17:57.760 --> 01:17:59.760
Phillips video pack and in North America

01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:01.760
On the Magnavox Odyssey 2

01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:03.760
But this game

01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:05.760
It has a twist on the whole thing

01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:07.760
So in Casey Munchkin

01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:09.760
You had drats

01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:11.760
The little monsters living in the maze

01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:13.760
And, you know, your little guy

01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:15.760
Would walk around

01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:17.760
And eat them and eat dots and stuff

01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:19.760
You know, kind of, yeah

01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:21.760
Pac-Man-y

01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:23.760
You know, had

01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:25.760
The same plethora

01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:27.760
Of mazes in the level editor

01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:29.760
But it just changed everything up

01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:31.760
So, you didn't have the dots

01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:33.760
And power pellet lookalikes

01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:35.760
You know, at all

01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:37.760
And instead you had the drats

01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:39.760
Who were the monsters

01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:41.760
Who would walk around growing trees

01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:43.760
And you could go around and eat the trees

01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:45.760
But you only got one point per tree

01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:47.760
Your main objective was the dratapillar

01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:49.760
The dratapillar

01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:51.760
I would say bears more than a striking

01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:53.760
Resemblance to, uh,

01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:55.760
Centipede

01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:57.760
In its kind of ball-shaped body

01:18:57.760 --> 01:18:59.760
So I'm gonna call Loki in the future

01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:01.760
The dratapillar

01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:03.760
Um, and anyway

01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:05.760
The way that you solve

01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:07.760
The levels and get points

01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:09.760
The big points are by going around

01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:11.760
And eating the dratapillar's body

01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:13.760
Now, first of all

01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:15.760
I love, like, the little

01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:17.760
Munchkin guy in here

01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:19.760
He rolls around all over the place and grins

01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:21.760
And when he wins

01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:23.760
He kinda smirks and winks at you

01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:25.760
Like, they do like a half smile

01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:27.760
It's just funny and clever

01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:29.760
But anyway, the dratapillar's head

01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:31.760
Will totally kill you

01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:33.760
So you have to go and you have to chase

01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:35.760
Behind it and eat its body

01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:37.760
And so when you have eaten all of its body

01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:39.760
Um

01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:41.760
You can, um

01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:43.760
You can also eat pieces in the middle too

01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:45.760
But it leaves those body parts there

01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:47.760
The dratapillar

01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:49.760
The dratapillar will totally kill you

01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:51.760
And you have to eat its body

01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:53.760
It's kinda morbid, isn't it?

01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:55.760
Coming up next on Casey Munchkin

01:19:55.760 --> 01:19:57.760
But, um

01:19:57.760 --> 01:19:59.760
But yeah, you can actually even just cut the segment

01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:01.760
By its head off by eating it

01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:03.760
Which leaves the rest of the segment there

01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:05.760
What kind of fucked up things are we teaching children?

01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:07.760
It's the 80s, Rob. No one cared

01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:09.760
Um, so when you eat a segment

01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:11.760
Of the dratapillar, it actually turns the drats

01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:13.760
White

01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:15.760
And what's kinda funny is like

01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:17.760
It's like in those old cartoons, you know

01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:19.760
Where the roadrunner would run by the

01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:21.760
Coyote and he'd be spinning in the middle of the road

01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:23.760
That's kinda what it does, it's pretty cool

01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:25.760
Um

01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:27.760
And you get 10 points for stunning them

01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:29.760
So that's, you know, different ways

01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:31.760
To, um, to score

01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:33.760
You know, bigger points in the game

01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:35.760
But of course, every time you eat a piece of the dratapillar's

01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:37.760
Body, it speeds up

01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:39.760
So, um

01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:41.760
You just have to pretty much be

01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:43.760
Fast, think quickly

01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:45.760
And, um

01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:47.760
You know, run through it. Now, one of the other

01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:49.760
Things about this though

01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:51.760
Is that it supported the Odyssey 2's voice

01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:53.760
Add-on module

01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:55.760
Which basically, it, um

01:20:55.760 --> 01:20:57.760
It would

01:20:57.760 --> 01:20:59.760
Hum, like, background music

01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:01.760
Um, through the game

01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:03.760
And then you'd get like, oh no!

01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:05.760
When you die, or laughter

01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:07.760
Or different things

01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:09.760
Um, and of course, with this game

01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:11.760
You get one life

01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:13.760
So, but it's

01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:15.760
It's a neat little game, you know

01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:17.760
It was definitely

01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:19.760
A unique twist on the maze game genre

01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:21.760
And one of the better games

01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:23.760
That came out for the Odyssey 2

01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:25.760
I spent a lot of time

01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:27.760
As a kid, well at the time

01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:29.760
I had a Colecovision

01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:31.760
I'll take that back, this was a house before that

01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:33.760
I didn't have a video game system

01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:35.760
We had, uh, The Neighbors, uh, Odyssey 2

01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:37.760
I have, I have

01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:39.760
One now, and I eventually got one

01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:41.760
Later, but, um

01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:43.760
I spent so much time on this one

01:21:43.760 --> 01:21:45.760
And, um, what was that other

01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:47.760
Fucking game that had the board game?

01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:51.760
I don't remember. I'll remember it

01:21:51.760 --> 01:21:53.760
When I'm totally not thinking

01:21:53.760 --> 01:21:55.760
About this. I think I've even done

01:21:55.760 --> 01:21:57.760
It for a segment too, so my brain's kinda

01:21:57.760 --> 01:21:59.760
Too much coding

01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:01.760
Alright, well there it is. But yeah, Casey

01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:03.760
Uh, Casey's Crazy Chase, also known

01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:05.760
As just Crazy Chase elsewhere. One way

01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:07.760
Or another. It's Casey's Crazy Chase

01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:09.760
Your classic game of the week

01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:11.760
You only get one life

01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:13.760
And you have to eat the body

01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:15.760
You better not let

01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:17.760
That Dratapillar fuck you up

01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:19.760
And you better eat its body

01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:23.760
And then once you've

01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:25.760
Devoured that Dratapillar

01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:27.760
You're gonna smile and wink and nod

01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:31.760
Did you see when- I did, I was watching

01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:33.760
This fucking hilarious- This very rudimentary

01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:35.760
Little Atari 2600, excuse me

01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:37.760
Odyssey level graphics of a little

01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:39.760
Winking face. Like, I just ate

01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:41.760
His entire body. He's like, hey

01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:43.760
Atari, wink

01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:45.760
Fuck you

01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:47.760
Next time, I'm gonna eat you from the inside out

01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:49.760
It's what I think of your centipede

01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:51.760
Yum, yum, yum. He's a Dratapillar

01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:53.760
Now

01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:55.760
I mean, bleep bleep bleep

01:22:55.760 --> 01:22:57.760
And Stoppy is helping you out

01:22:57.760 --> 01:22:59.760
Quest for the Rings. That was it, thank you

01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:01.760
Was the board game. I was like, it was something

01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:04.760
And you have done that as a classic game before

01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:06.760
I have, but we, you know, we had

01:23:06.760 --> 01:23:08.760
Like, it was the full thing. We just said fuck the board game

01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:09.760
We just play the game

01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:11.760
Quest for the Rings, I mean, I remember

01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:13.760
That was a pretty, like, for what it was

01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:15.760
An old ass game, that was a pretty

01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:17.760
Rich, like, pretty

01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:19.760
Big game, you know what I mean? Like

01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:21.760
The things that it did going into the different rooms and stuff

01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:23.760
We were just like, first graders

01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:25.760
That didn't give a shit

01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:27.760
For second grade, we're like, whatever, we're just gonna play the game

01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:29.760
The other thing I was really good at was

01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:31.760
Crypt equip. I think that's what it was called

01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:33.760
It's the word scramble game

01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:35.760
But I was always really good at this, so whatever

01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:37.760
Whatever

01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:38.760
Alright, that's it

01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:40.760
The word is Dratapillar

01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:42.760
Dratapillar

01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:44.760
You know what? I say now

01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:46.760
That if anyone is a shit in chat

01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:48.760
They're the Dratapillar

01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:50.760
And will eat their bodies and leave the head

01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:53.760
That's kinda weird

01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:54.760
Poisonous little heads

01:23:54.760 --> 01:23:56.760
That's very weird, you're weird, stop being weird

01:23:56.760 --> 01:23:58.760
You know what?

01:23:58.760 --> 01:24:00.760
So are you, you hang out with me

01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:02.760
What does that say about you?

01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:04.760
When I'm forced to

01:24:04.760 --> 01:24:06.760
Bitch

01:24:06.760 --> 01:24:08.760
Alright, we're gonna take a quick break

01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:10.760
Hey Rob, let me do a goddamn break

01:24:10.760 --> 01:24:12.760
No, Rob!

01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:14.760
What?

01:24:14.760 --> 01:24:16.760
Plenty more of this to come

01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:18.760
When we come back with more of

01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:20.760
Orange Lounge Radio

01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:22.760
Right after this

01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:25.760
Welcome back everybody to

01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:27.760
Orange Lounge Radio

01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:29.760
Live tonight with the

01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:31.760
677th episode of our show

01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:33.760
Already in Progress

01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:35.760
I'm here, Loki's here

01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:37.760
Dark Soccer is here

01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:39.760
And you're here, thanks for listening to us

01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:41.760
Be it live, during the

01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:43.760
Oscar ceremonies

01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:45.760
Which I know has been distracting for some people

01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:47.760
I have not even been paying attention

01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:49.760
I did see some of the pictures of people on the red carpet though

01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:51.760
Even though I don't usually get into all that fashion stuff

01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:53.760
Outside of like Project Runway

01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:55.760
I'm waiting for the fashion photo review version

01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:57.760
The fashion photo review or whatever?

01:24:57.760 --> 01:24:59.760
Some of the people on the red carpet look really good

01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:01.760
I gotta say, there's been some really good outfits on the red carpet

01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:03.760
Did you see what Janelle Monae was wearing?

01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:05.760
No, was it a suit?

01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:07.760
No, no it was not, it was very much like a

01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:09.760
Like a triangular dress type of thing

01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:11.760
She looked like she could have been a boss in Final Fantasy

01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:13.760
It was great

01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:15.760
Go look some of these dresses up

01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:17.760
Look amazing on the runway

01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:19.760
Anyhow, I wanted to ask you guys about this before we got into

01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:21.760
Fire News, before the show, one of our listeners

01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:23.760
Tiger Claw sent me a link

01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:25.760
And I thought this was an interesting thing to talk about

01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:27.760
Since we do like to do classic games, right

01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:29.760
And you know, play old games sometimes

01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:31.760
And sometimes we have to rely

01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:33.760
On emulation to provide

01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:35.760
Those games that

01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:37.760
You know, might not be accessible otherwise

01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:39.760
And that happened to a Super Nintendo

01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:41.760
Game this past week, Quick the Thunder Rabbit

01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:43.760
Was a platformer for the Super Nintendo

01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:45.760
That was never released, it was a port I guess

01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:47.760
Of an Amiga title

01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:49.760
Oh, did you find the picture?

01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:51.760
Yeah, she's got like the whole

01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:55.760
Fuck, French Revolution

01:25:55.760 --> 01:25:57.760
18th century French

01:25:57.760 --> 01:25:59.760
Dress

01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:01.760
The hip bustle

01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:03.760
Can I talk about the Thunder Rabbit, please?

01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:05.760
I guess

01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:07.760
Don't talk about our competition tonight

01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:09.760
Janelle Monae, she's talented, but she's our competition, Dark Sakura

01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:11.760
Stop talking about her

01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:13.760
Anyway, so Quick the Thunder Rabbit on Super Nintendo

01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:15.760
Was a port of an Amiga title

01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:17.760
And I guess it was a platformer

01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:19.760
And it would be like one of those auto scrolling shooter

01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:21.760
Games and fighting games and what have you

01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:23.760
So somebody actually found

01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:25.760
A copy of this game, this user

01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:27.760
Online, but he altered the game

01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:29.760
When he released it, he edited in a

01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:31.760
Splash game, or excuse me

01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:33.760
A splash screen to the start of the game

01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:35.760
And then made some

01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:37.760
Small alterations to the game's

01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:39.760
Code, I'm assuming to

01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:41.760
Make it run better or

01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:43.760
Run more appropriately

01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:45.760
Maybe on the forum where this was released

01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:47.760
SNES Central asked

01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:49.760
In the interest of preservation, would it be possible

01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:51.760
To upload the unedited ROM image

01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:53.760
And the answer was

01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:55.760
No

01:26:55.760 --> 01:26:57.760
So some people feeling like

01:26:57.760 --> 01:26:59.760
This is that horrible

01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:01.760
Gigantic TMZ

01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:03.760
Watermark on a popular

01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:05.760
Photo

01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:07.760
Or it's like you own a very

01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:09.760
Rare painting

01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:11.760
And you decide to paint your initials

01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:13.760
Or what was that painting

01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:15.760
Where somebody like repainted Jesus'

01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:17.760
Face, this is a thing that was like

01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:19.760
In the news a couple years

01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:21.760
Ago where some gal got a rare

01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:23.760
Painting and she painted over the face

01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:25.760
Or something, it was horrible, anyway

01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:27.760
So some people are saying this like that

01:27:27.760 --> 01:27:29.760
But it's funny because I'm kind of reminded

01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:31.760
Of like back in the day

01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:33.760
On like games on Commodore 64

01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:35.760
And like the older

01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:37.760
PC games, like the splash screens

01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:39.760
And the built in trainers and all that shit

01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:41.760
Was par for the course, you would see that

01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:43.760
Everywhere

01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:45.760
But at the same time I also understand why

01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:47.760
It's like dude this is not a

01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:49.760
Common game by any means

01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:51.760
You have the one copy potentially

01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:53.760
Give us the actual game

01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:55.760
It's kind of a dick move but hey at least you have a copy of the game now

01:27:55.760 --> 01:27:57.760
Yeah

01:27:57.760 --> 01:27:59.760
You can play, I mean yeah it sucks that

01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:01.760
There were some changes but it's better than nothing

01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:03.760
I suppose it's better than nothing

01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:05.760
DarkSakura you're big on classic games

01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:07.760
Do you think this is defacing a classic

01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:09.760
Painting or they have the right to

01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:11.760
Do this because they're the only people that have it

01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:13.760
I truly do believe that it is

01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:15.760
Definitely doing

01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:17.760
An injustice

01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:19.760
To the game

01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:21.760
So

01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:23.760
I think that if

01:28:23.760 --> 01:28:25.760
It

01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:27.760
Well at least, I understand winning it out for preservation

01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:29.760
At least in the sake of this

01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:31.760
Having an unedited

01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:33.760
ROM of the game

01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:35.760
Should be still

01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:37.760
Distributed for that preservation purpose

01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:39.760
In its unadulterated form

01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:41.760
It's sort of like

01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:43.760
Or how about like this, let me put it this way

01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:45.760
Imagine where they found

01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:47.760
All of those, you do the x-ray

01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:49.760
Of the paintings to see the original painting

01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:51.760
Underneath it right

01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:53.760
Like for example the beached whale

01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:55.760
That was in that one piece of artwork

01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:57.760
Or going into Van Gogh's work

01:28:57.760 --> 01:28:59.760
And finding

01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:01.760
His, that he's painted over other

01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:03.760
Works, you know it's kind of

01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:05.760
The same thing

01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:07.760
Whether or not it's done in

01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:09.760
Um

01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:11.760
What's the word I'm thinking of

01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:13.760
Done out of

01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:15.760
Good taste, done out of

01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:17.760
Respect, like good intentions

01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:19.760
Good intentions, or even if there had been malice

01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:21.760
Behind it, there was no malice in this

01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:23.760
At the same time

01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:25.760
It would still be

01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:27.760
A shame

01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:29.760
I don't think they would have had a problem if they just like

01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:31.760
Fixed it to run or something like that

01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:33.760
Like he put a splash screen

01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:35.760
No, actually some people believe

01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:37.760
And this story that Tigerclaw sent me

01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:39.760
Went on into like an interview with some video game

01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:41.760
And actually says, even though

01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:43.760
This guy doesn't think he's doing harm

01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:45.760
Because he's trying to make the game more playable

01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:47.760
It actually still is a disservice because this is a piece

01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:49.760
Of gaming's history, you know

01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:51.760
He's not the guy who created the original game

01:29:51.760 --> 01:29:53.760
I can see that perspective

01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:55.760
Here's, okay, here's another one

01:29:55.760 --> 01:29:57.760
And this is gonna be highly controversial

01:29:57.760 --> 01:29:59.760
But I'm gonna use something that's been a point

01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:01.760
Of contention in religious circles

01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:03.760
The writings of Josephus

01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:05.760
Have been altered ever since

01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:07.760
Like

01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:09.760
Were altered to say that yes

01:30:09.760 --> 01:30:11.760
He saw Jesus

01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:13.760
The original writings never said that

01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:15.760
I see, I see

01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:17.760
But it's the same thing where it goes

01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:19.760
In and makes an alteration

01:30:19.760 --> 01:30:21.760
It's revisionist history is what it is

01:30:21.760 --> 01:30:23.760
It's kind of like how you have

01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:25.760
The King James version of the Bible

01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:27.760
Right, not to get too religious, but

01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:29.760
That's also historical

01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:31.760
Not just that, it wasn't necessarily

01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:33.760
An interpretation of it, it was

01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:35.760
Altered

01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:37.760
By picking certain

01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:39.760
Items in translation and putting

01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:41.760
Them into a way that politically

01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:43.760
Benefited his regime

01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:45.760
And in this case, we don't know

01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:47.760
The reason that this guy did this

01:30:47.760 --> 01:30:49.760
If it was as some type of

01:30:49.760 --> 01:30:51.760
Reflection on himself

01:30:51.760 --> 01:30:53.760
Or some way to hold power

01:30:53.760 --> 01:30:55.760
Over the community, we don't know that

01:30:55.760 --> 01:30:57.760
My thought is, maybe there's

01:30:57.760 --> 01:30:59.760
Two answers here, like

01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:01.760
Release the original cart the way

01:31:01.760 --> 01:31:03.760
It was done if it's broken or whatever

01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:05.760
And then go ahead and alter it

01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:07.760
Release the fixed one and now put your initials on it

01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:09.760
Because you did fix the game

01:31:09.760 --> 01:31:11.760
Stope has another good comparison

01:31:11.760 --> 01:31:13.760
The Diary of Anne Frank

01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:15.760
Her father edited it to remove

01:31:15.760 --> 01:31:17.760
Her talks about her

01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:19.760
Puberty, sexuality

01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:21.760
You know, different things that young women

01:31:21.760 --> 01:31:23.760
Go through, sure

01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:25.760
But again, it's revisionist

01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:27.760
It's, in this case,

01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:29.760
More of a patriarchal type of control, but still

01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:31.760
But it's the same thing

01:31:31.760 --> 01:31:33.760
I look at this as no different

01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:35.760
Dungeon Buster, with an interesting

01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:37.760
Perspective, though, that I think is worth sharing

01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:39.760
Over at live.vognetwork.com, says

01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:41.760
On the other hand, a lot of the preserved games

01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:43.760
On sites like archive.org

01:31:43.760 --> 01:31:45.760
For old PCs, they open with

01:31:45.760 --> 01:31:47.760
Cracked screens because they're the

01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:49.760
Only ones available

01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:51.760
And kind of like I said

01:31:51.760 --> 01:31:53.760
You know, even though a lot of us

01:31:53.760 --> 01:31:55.760
Kind of see what's going on now

01:31:55.760 --> 01:31:57.760
As a negative, what this guy is

01:31:57.760 --> 01:31:59.760
Doing was perfectly par

01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:01.760
For the course in the 80s and early 90s

01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:03.760
It's like a B

01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:05.760
It's not an A

01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:07.760
Of just releasing it, but hey, you know what

01:32:07.760 --> 01:32:09.760
It's working

01:32:09.760 --> 01:32:11.760
It's a B movie? What is it?

01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:13.760
You're rated on a scale, you know

01:32:13.760 --> 01:32:15.760
It's like a B, you know

01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:17.760
It could have been better if you released an altered

01:32:17.760 --> 01:32:19.760
But at least it's out there

01:32:19.760 --> 01:32:21.760
It's like a B

01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:23.760
I give it three stars

01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:25.760
Out of five

01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:27.760
Three out of five

01:32:27.760 --> 01:32:29.760
Alright, let's do some

01:32:29.760 --> 01:32:31.760
Rapid fire news

01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:33.760
Go around quickly and talk about some of the things

01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:35.760
That have been happening in the game industry this week

01:32:35.760 --> 01:32:37.760
Loki, speaking of something I would give

01:32:37.760 --> 01:32:39.760
Three out of five, Irrational

01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:41.760
Games, they've changed the name of their

01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:43.760
Studio to Ghost

01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:45.760
Story Games

01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:47.760
Goatsy Games? That's irrational

01:32:47.760 --> 01:32:49.760
Ghost Story Games

01:32:49.760 --> 01:32:51.760
Ghost Story Games

01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:53.760
I hope that you're only making spooky games

01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:55.760
Their reasoning before

01:32:55.760 --> 01:32:57.760
They said was because

01:32:57.760 --> 01:32:59.760
It was irrational

01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:01.760
Because ghost stories are immersive, exciting

01:33:01.760 --> 01:33:03.760
And steeped in the community

01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:05.760
That reminds us of our mission

01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:09.760
Really, it's just because you couldn't

01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:11.760
You're like, ah crap, we gotta

01:33:11.760 --> 01:33:13.760
Come up with something guys

01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:15.760
Ghost Stories

01:33:15.760 --> 01:33:17.760
I have a ghost story for you all

01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:19.760
Knock knock

01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:21.760
Who's there? Boo

01:33:21.760 --> 01:33:23.760
Boo

01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:25.760
Who? Don't cry

01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:27.760
I have a ghost story for you

01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:29.760
What? The Phantom

01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:31.760
Of the opera?

01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:33.760
No no no, what was that machine

01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:35.760
That we saw at E3

01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:37.760
Oh oh

01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:39.760
Where's my shade sound?

01:33:39.760 --> 01:33:41.760
That was like a C plus

01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:43.760
Joke, but it was a little intellectual

01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:45.760
For the show

01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:47.760
Coleco Chameleon Zero

01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:49.760
I give that joke

01:33:49.760 --> 01:33:51.760
A two out of five

01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:53.760
You know what, if I were to

01:33:53.760 --> 01:33:55.760
Roll my eyes any higher, I'd be looking

01:33:55.760 --> 01:33:57.760
At your backyard

01:33:57.760 --> 01:33:59.760
Actually you'd be looking at a sheet that

01:33:59.760 --> 01:34:01.760
That's covering the backyard, anyway

01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:05.760
JD and Chaz is

01:34:05.760 --> 01:34:07.760
So that's a boot

01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:09.760
Are we gonna toot it or boot it?

01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:11.760
Alright please move on please move on

01:34:11.760 --> 01:34:13.760
We'll keep moving on

01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:15.760
So hey, guess what

01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:17.760
There's gonna be some more games that are

01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:19.760
Backwards compatible with the Xbox One

01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:21.760
Toot

01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:23.760
So Assassin's Creed Rogue

01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:25.760
Borderlands 2

01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:27.760
Which is also I think one of the games of the

01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:29.760
Gold this month as well

01:34:29.760 --> 01:34:31.760
And

01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:33.760
King of Fighters 2002 unlimited match

01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:35.760
Are now backwards compatible

01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:37.760
That's cool

01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:39.760
Yeah so

01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:41.760
Yeah especially with the fact that

01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:43.760
Borderlands 2 they're kind of giving away

01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:45.760
For free

01:34:45.760 --> 01:34:47.760
Seriously if you have not played Borderlands

01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:49.760
My god

01:34:49.760 --> 01:34:51.760
Go play Borderlands

01:34:51.760 --> 01:34:53.760
Borderlands 2 is fucking awesome

01:34:53.760 --> 01:34:55.760
Wasn't one of the big games on Xbox One

01:34:55.760 --> 01:34:57.760
Early on and PlayStation 4 to be fair

01:34:57.760 --> 01:34:59.760
The Handsome Jack collection

01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:01.760
Yes I have that in my library

01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:03.760
Fucking haven't played it at all

01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:05.760
What's funny about that is that

01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:07.760
Half that is Borderlands 2

01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:09.760
But they went back

01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:11.760
And what HD-ified it

01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:13.760
I think it wasn't that board

01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:15.760
Handsome Jack collection I was one and two

01:35:15.760 --> 01:35:17.760
No no it's two and the

01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:19.760
Whatever that

01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:21.760
Pre-sequel that one

01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:23.760
One is not in the Handsome Jack collection

01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:25.760
I haven't played Pre-sequel yet so that might be worth it

01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:27.760
Once again though

01:35:27.760 --> 01:35:29.760
I'm getting into that groove where like

01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:31.760
I buy a bunch of shit I'm never gonna play

01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:33.760
It's as bad as Steam

01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:35.760
I've kind of stopped that on Steam for the most part

01:35:35.760 --> 01:35:37.760
For the most part

01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:41.760
Oh YYR in chat says Space Invaders Infinity

01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:43.760
Gene that's one of the games

01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:45.760
That's backwards compatible now

01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:47.760
Hell yeah if that is one of them

01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:49.760
YYR

01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:51.760
If it is it's not in this release

01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:53.760
That was a great game on 360

01:35:53.760 --> 01:35:55.760
I love when those games

01:35:55.760 --> 01:35:57.760
I bought on 360 just randomly

01:35:57.760 --> 01:35:59.760
Show up on my Xbox One one day

01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:01.760
There we go call them back to the

01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:03.760
Very opening moments of the show

01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:05.760
Things Microsoft is doing right

01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:07.760
Backwards compatibility

01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:09.760
Better than anybody else right now

01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:11.760
Isn't that great that purchases you made on a previous system

01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:13.760
Roll over to a newer system

01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:15.760
Isn't that something?

01:36:15.760 --> 01:36:17.760
That's so crazy

01:36:17.760 --> 01:36:19.760
It's as if

01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:21.760
With Nintendo where Virtual Console has persisted

01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:23.760
With the Wii and the Wii U

01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:25.760
And now eventually on the Switch

01:36:25.760 --> 01:36:27.760
As if somehow

01:36:27.760 --> 01:36:29.760
They would have some sort of record that you made

01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:31.760
Those purchases

01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:33.760
If only they had the forethought to do that

01:36:33.760 --> 01:36:35.760
Too bad

01:36:35.760 --> 01:36:37.760
Too bad that other companies don't have

01:36:37.760 --> 01:36:39.760
A unified marketplace like that

01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:41.760
Like Sony

01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:43.760
Oh wait Sony

01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:45.760
Too bad we can't bring those

01:36:45.760 --> 01:36:47.760
Backwards compatibility

01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:49.760
The Playstation Pro is just

01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:51.760
Not strong enough

01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:53.760
To emulate something the PSP can emulate

01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:55.760
Anyway

01:36:55.760 --> 01:36:57.760
YYR says

01:36:57.760 --> 01:36:59.760
The full list is

01:36:59.760 --> 01:37:01.760
Borderlands 2, Assassin's Creed, Rogue, King of Fighters

01:37:01.760 --> 01:37:03.760
2002, Gyromancer

01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:05.760
Moondiver and Space Invaders

01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:07.760
Infinity Gene

01:37:07.760 --> 01:37:09.760
Which is funny cause

01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:11.760
Is Gyromancer that Square Enix puzzle game?

01:37:11.760 --> 01:37:13.760
Cause I own that one too

01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:15.760
And I had Moondiver so I had like three of those games

01:37:15.760 --> 01:37:17.760
I didn't even realize that

01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:19.760
I have not fired up my Xbox One games library

01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:21.760
Every time I've been firing that up recently

01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:23.760
I've just been going right into Skyrim

01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:25.760
Ah yes I do see them on the list now that I actually

01:37:25.760 --> 01:37:27.760
Cause this is a, wow

01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:29.760
That is one extensive list there

01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:31.760
Oh what of all the 360

01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:33.760
Of all the games that are backwards compatible

01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:35.760
I know, if you haven't checked your Xbox One

01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:37.760
In a while, like go into your games library

01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:39.760
And just look like in your two download list

01:37:39.760 --> 01:37:41.760
You might just find like

01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:43.760
Surprise, you've got like 12 games that you bought

01:37:43.760 --> 01:37:45.760
On Xbox 360 that are now backwards compatible

01:37:45.760 --> 01:37:47.760
That's happened to me quite a bit

01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:49.760
I mean, they fucking got

01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:51.760
Beat and groovy working on Xbox One

01:37:51.760 --> 01:37:53.760
Backwards compatibility

01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:55.760
Why did somebody waste their fucking breath

01:37:55.760 --> 01:37:57.760
Even testing to see if that game loaded

01:37:57.760 --> 01:37:59.760
Like that's amazing

01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:01.760
That is amazing

01:38:01.760 --> 01:38:03.760
That's dedication

01:38:03.760 --> 01:38:05.760
Alright, anyway

01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:07.760
Ah hey, a follow up

01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:09.760
To something we talked about last week

01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:11.760
In the case of the

01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:13.760
Missing box of Super Nintendo

01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:15.760
Games that went missing

01:38:15.760 --> 01:38:17.760
I guess it was blamed for the

01:38:17.760 --> 01:38:19.760
Lost in transit, yeah, lost in transit

01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:21.760
Lost in transit, you know

01:38:21.760 --> 01:38:23.760
Pretty quick to blame somebody stealing it

01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:25.760
At the post office, because let's be real

01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:27.760
That's what would usually happen

01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:29.760
But in the interest of fairness

01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:31.760
And we should say

01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:33.760
Everything's okay, nobody stole it

01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:35.760
It was recovered, that's right

01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:37.760
They did recover the

01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:39.760
Super Nintendo games valued at $10,000

01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:41.760
Apparently what happened is

01:38:41.760 --> 01:38:43.760
They were found

01:38:43.760 --> 01:38:45.760
At an Atlanta, Georgia

01:38:45.760 --> 01:38:47.760
Mail recovery center

01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:49.760
So how about that, so Bobby was trying to get him redirected

01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:51.760
To his house, no he didn't

01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:53.760
I'm looking to see what I have

01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:55.760
Anyway, so it was at the Atlanta, Georgia

01:38:55.760 --> 01:38:57.760
Mail recovery center so they were able to locate the package

01:38:57.760 --> 01:38:59.760
Here's the interesting thing

01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:01.760
Because this was

01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:03.760
Going around on so many news

01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:05.760
Outlets and everything

01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:07.760
Apparently it was giving the post office a bad rep

01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:09.760
Right, because a lot of us were jumping

01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:11.760
To conclusions about, oh it was stolen

01:39:11.760 --> 01:39:13.760
So this guy was able

01:39:13.760 --> 01:39:15.760
To get through and actually get noticed

01:39:15.760 --> 01:39:17.760
He says in his

01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:19.760
Little statement on what happened

01:39:19.760 --> 01:39:21.760
He told me straight up the reason he was

01:39:21.760 --> 01:39:23.760
Contacting me was because of the news articles

01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:25.760
He'd encountered on the case

01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:27.760
So thanks to the coverage, I had a strong

01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:29.760
Contact within the US postal service

01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:31.760
Who passed me to his employee who opened the

01:39:31.760 --> 01:39:33.760
Investigation and then found the package

01:39:33.760 --> 01:39:35.760
So how about that y'all, angry gamers

01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:37.760
Accomplished something, angry

01:39:37.760 --> 01:39:39.760
Chated fucking gamers accomplished

01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:41.760
Something, good job

01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:43.760
100 Nintendo, Super Nintendo

01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:45.760
Games for you, that's more games than you'll

01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:47.760
Find on the virtual console at launch

01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:49.760
For the Nintendo Switch

01:39:49.760 --> 01:39:51.760
I do think I have most of these

01:39:51.760 --> 01:39:53.760
I love it

01:39:53.760 --> 01:39:55.760
Loki, fuck off but I love it

01:39:55.760 --> 01:39:57.760
Maybe that's lost somewhere

01:39:57.760 --> 01:39:59.760
Check Atlanta

01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:01.760
Check Bobby's house

01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:03.760
Bobby, do you have virtual console?

01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:05.760
Do you have virtual console in that basement?

01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:07.760
Is that where it went?

01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:09.760
Bobby Blackwolf

01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:11.760
In the conservatory

01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:13.760
With the computer hacking kit

01:40:13.760 --> 01:40:15.760
Alright, hey

01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:17.760
Steam prices are going up soon

01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:19.760
Okay, just kidding

01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:21.760
That would be the clickbait headline I would try to post

01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:23.760
On Facebook, but it's not as bad as it sounds

01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:25.760
Because the steam prices are not going up

01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:27.760
In the states, so if you do come across

01:40:27.760 --> 01:40:29.760
An article about steam prices going up soon

01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:31.760
Here's what's really happening

01:40:31.760 --> 01:40:33.760
Yes, sales tax is now

01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:35.760
Included in the prices

01:40:35.760 --> 01:40:37.760
Across new countries

01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:39.760
There's new tax laws that are requiring sales tax

01:40:39.760 --> 01:40:41.760
Be applied to digital goods

01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:43.760
And services in some new countries

01:40:43.760 --> 01:40:45.760
Starting in March in Switzerland, South Korea

01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:47.760
Japan, New Zealand, Iceland

01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:49.760
South Africa and India

01:40:49.760 --> 01:40:51.760
April in Serbia, May in Taiwan

01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:53.760
And July in Australia

01:40:53.760 --> 01:40:55.760
So for example the tax in Australia is 10%

01:40:55.760 --> 01:40:57.760
So in July the price of steam games

01:40:57.760 --> 01:40:59.760
Will be 10% higher

01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:01.760
It is going to pay for this tax

01:41:01.760 --> 01:41:03.760
It's not like the US where you get

01:41:03.760 --> 01:41:05.760
Charged tax after the advertised price

01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:07.760
In these countries

01:41:07.760 --> 01:41:09.760
For whatever reason the tax code is written

01:41:09.760 --> 01:41:11.760
That the tax must be included in the advertised price

01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:13.760
I guess that's like

01:41:13.760 --> 01:41:15.760
Buying flight tickets

01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:17.760
Here in the US

01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:19.760
Now have to include all the other little taxes and things in them

01:41:19.760 --> 01:41:21.760
So steam is having to do

01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:23.760
It's alright Australia, you're used to getting screwed over

01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:25.760
When it comes to pricing anyway

01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:27.760
It's not nice

01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:29.760
It is not nice

01:41:29.760 --> 01:41:31.760
That's alright, wait for the sales

01:41:31.760 --> 01:41:33.760
Wait for those sales

01:41:33.760 --> 01:41:35.760
Alright, Dark Sakura, how about you?

01:41:35.760 --> 01:41:37.760
What do you have for us?

01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:39.760
Well a couple of things actually

01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:41.760
That make me super happy

01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:43.760
And one of them is a huge fuck you

01:41:43.760 --> 01:41:45.760
So I like that even better

01:41:45.760 --> 01:41:47.760
This one is the first happy news

01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:49.760
One of the favorite games of my household

01:41:49.760 --> 01:41:51.760
Actually a series I should say

01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:53.760
Are the Wonder Boy games

01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:55.760
That came out on Sega Master System

01:41:55.760 --> 01:41:57.760
Well now

01:41:57.760 --> 01:41:59.760
Dotemu has brought out

01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:01.760
A remastered version

01:42:01.760 --> 01:42:03.760
Of Wonder Boy 3 The Dragon's Trap

01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:05.760
And it's just going to be called

01:42:05.760 --> 01:42:07.760
Wonder Boy The Dragon's Trap

01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:09.760
It has a hand drawn style

01:42:09.760 --> 01:42:11.760
And

01:42:11.760 --> 01:42:13.760
But it's also

01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:17.760
Got the music

01:42:17.760 --> 01:42:19.760
And you can swap

01:42:19.760 --> 01:42:21.760
Between the new

01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:23.760
Hand drawn style

01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:25.760
And the original style

01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:27.760
So that's really awesome

01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:29.760
There is a whole

01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:31.760
Trailer up and I would suggest

01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:33.760
That people check it out, it's really sweet

01:42:33.760 --> 01:42:35.760
Um

01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:37.760
Next is something

01:42:37.760 --> 01:42:39.760
That

01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:41.760
I have to bask in this

01:42:41.760 --> 01:42:43.760
For a minute

01:42:43.760 --> 01:42:45.760
Humble Bundle, which by the way

01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:47.760
I sent you a message on a bundle

01:42:47.760 --> 01:42:49.760
I actually knew about this bundle

01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:51.760
And I'll tell the listeners about it

01:42:51.760 --> 01:42:53.760
Because it's the Humble Civilization Bundle

01:42:53.760 --> 01:42:55.760
This isn't what Dark Sakura was going to talk about

01:42:55.760 --> 01:42:57.760
But their newest bundle is the Humble Civilization Bundle

01:42:57.760 --> 01:42:59.760
And if I remember right off the top of my head

01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:01.760
You can pay a dollar

01:43:01.760 --> 01:43:03.760
For a dollar

01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:05.760
For a dollar

01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:07.760
You guys, if you don't own

01:43:07.760 --> 01:43:09.760
Now look, Civilization 3 is actually my least

01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:11.760
Favorite in the entire series, I'm going to be honest

01:43:11.760 --> 01:43:13.760
But Civ 4 is one of the best

01:43:13.760 --> 01:43:15.760
So like if you can't be bothered

01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:17.760
To pay one dollar

01:43:17.760 --> 01:43:19.760
For Civilization 4

01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:21.760
Literally, I can't

01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:23.760
With you

01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:25.760
But you have to also be a fan

01:43:25.760 --> 01:43:27.760
Of those types of games

01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:29.760
Not for a dollar, you don't really have to be a fan

01:43:29.760 --> 01:43:31.760
If you've got a fixed income

01:43:31.760 --> 01:43:33.760
Type of thing going on, look, I'm not going to

01:43:33.760 --> 01:43:35.760
Break you too bad, but look, seriously, if you have the room

01:43:35.760 --> 01:43:37.760
In your budget to forgo a soda

01:43:37.760 --> 01:43:39.760
And buy the Civilization

01:43:39.760 --> 01:43:41.760
Humble Bundle instead

01:43:41.760 --> 01:43:43.760
I would encourage you to do so

01:43:43.760 --> 01:43:45.760
As Dark Sakura takes

01:43:45.760 --> 01:43:47.760
A big swig of her Diet Pepsi

01:43:47.760 --> 01:43:49.760
That she probably paid a dollar fifty for at the store

01:43:49.760 --> 01:43:51.760
And says, I don't have time for Civ 4

01:43:51.760 --> 01:43:53.760
Actually, it tastes pretty awful

01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:55.760
That's blood water, okay

01:43:55.760 --> 01:43:57.760
Actually, it tastes like it

01:43:57.760 --> 01:43:59.760
Thanks to my nose, but still

01:43:59.760 --> 01:44:01.760
But my good news

01:44:01.760 --> 01:44:03.760
The Humble Freedom Bundle

01:44:03.760 --> 01:44:05.760
Raised

01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:07.760
6.73 million

01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:09.760
To aid

01:44:09.760 --> 01:44:11.760
Immigrants

01:44:11.760 --> 01:44:13.760
In response to

01:44:13.760 --> 01:44:15.760
The new Voldemort

01:44:15.760 --> 01:44:17.760
Immigration ban

01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:21.760
You know what, I don't even want to call him Voldemort

01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:23.760
Because he's fucking orange

01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:25.760
In response to what happened

01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:27.760
I'm just going to call him the dump

01:44:27.760 --> 01:44:29.760
I'm just going to call him the dump

01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:31.760
Because he's a human garbage dump

01:44:31.760 --> 01:44:33.760
Anyway

01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:35.760
The proceeds are going to charities like

01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:37.760
The ACLU, the American Civil Liberties

01:44:37.760 --> 01:44:39.760
Union, the International Rescue

01:44:39.760 --> 01:44:41.760
Committees, and Doctors Without

01:44:41.760 --> 01:44:43.760
Borders

01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:45.760
Basically, it offered

01:44:45.760 --> 01:44:47.760
Over $600

01:44:47.760 --> 01:44:49.760
Worth of gains for $30

01:44:49.760 --> 01:44:51.760
Including some pretty

01:44:51.760 --> 01:44:53.760
Big ones like The Witness

01:44:53.760 --> 01:44:55.760
And they also

01:44:55.760 --> 01:44:57.760
Said that they would match

01:44:57.760 --> 01:44:59.760
Up to $300,000

01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:01.760
Of the proceeds

01:45:01.760 --> 01:45:03.760
Totally, that's up to

01:45:03.760 --> 01:45:05.760
6

01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:07.760
.73 million

01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:09.760
They did

01:45:09.760 --> 01:45:11.760
Some of the games finally started running out

01:45:11.760 --> 01:45:13.760
Because I'm sure some of the game makers

01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:15.760
Hey, I think it's awesome that even the

01:45:15.760 --> 01:45:17.760
Creator of Stardew Valley

01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:19.760
That game is hot shit right now in the indie scene

01:45:19.760 --> 01:45:21.760
And in the gaming scene in general

01:45:21.760 --> 01:45:23.760
It's awesome that that guy would contribute

01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:25.760
200,000 copies of his game

01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:27.760
To this cause, but the reality is

01:45:27.760 --> 01:45:29.760
He had set a number

01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:31.760
And once they exceeded that number those keys were gone

01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:33.760
So in the final hours

01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:35.760
I think once they broke it was either

01:45:35.760 --> 01:45:37.760
200,000 or 250,000, sorry I don't remember

01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:39.760
The number, but some of the games

01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:41.760
A good chunk of them kind of fell off the list

01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:43.760
Like Stardew Valley I know is probably the biggest name

01:45:43.760 --> 01:45:45.760
That no longer became available

01:45:45.760 --> 01:45:47.760
At that point, but again

01:45:47.760 --> 01:45:49.760
That's not a read because that's awesome

01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:51.760
But a game like that

01:45:51.760 --> 01:45:53.760
That's still hot shit

01:45:53.760 --> 01:45:55.760
Getting $15 a copy is donated to a cause

01:45:55.760 --> 01:45:57.760
Like this at all

01:45:57.760 --> 01:45:59.760
Even more if you look at the number of keys that were available

01:45:59.760 --> 01:46:01.760
Think of how many people

01:46:01.760 --> 01:46:03.760
That was

01:46:03.760 --> 01:46:05.760
Who gave a

01:46:05.760 --> 01:46:07.760
Fuck you

01:46:07.760 --> 01:46:09.760
To the establishment

01:46:09.760 --> 01:46:11.760
Or just wanted to play some games

01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:13.760
But still

01:46:13.760 --> 01:46:15.760
It was a big fuck you

01:46:15.760 --> 01:46:17.760
And I am so proud of them for doing this

01:46:17.760 --> 01:46:23.760
Moving on

01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:25.760
Alright that's it for our rapid fire news

01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:27.760
So let's talk about

01:46:27.760 --> 01:46:29.760
What is coming out in stores this week

01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:31.760
Loki, gee what could possibly be coming out in the US this Friday

01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:33.760
Horizon Zero Dawn

01:46:33.760 --> 01:46:35.760
That's right

01:46:35.760 --> 01:46:37.760
That's a big deal too

01:46:37.760 --> 01:46:39.760
That is a big deal

01:46:39.760 --> 01:46:41.760
Torment, Tides of Numeric

01:46:41.760 --> 01:46:43.760
Isn't Horizon getting pretty good reviews too?

01:46:43.760 --> 01:46:45.760
It is

01:46:45.760 --> 01:46:47.760
I didn't have my eyes on it

01:46:47.760 --> 01:46:49.760
Until I started to hear about some of these reviews

01:46:49.760 --> 01:46:51.760
I don't always listen to reviewers

01:46:51.760 --> 01:46:53.760
But when the feedback is uniformly positive

01:46:53.760 --> 01:46:55.760
Like it is for this game

01:46:55.760 --> 01:46:57.760
Or majority positive

01:46:57.760 --> 01:46:59.760
Like it is for this game

01:46:59.760 --> 01:47:01.760
Or like that movie

01:47:01.760 --> 01:47:03.760
That has 100% of Rotten Tomatoes right now

01:47:03.760 --> 01:47:05.760
That Get Out

01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:07.760
Has 100% of Rotten Tomatoes right now

01:47:07.760 --> 01:47:09.760
That definitely grabbed my attention

01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:11.760
Like oh maybe this is something I should be paying attention to

01:47:11.760 --> 01:47:13.760
And go see

01:47:13.760 --> 01:47:15.760
Same thing kind of happens with video games

01:47:15.760 --> 01:47:17.760
Yeah

01:47:17.760 --> 01:47:21.760
So we had a game called Torment, Tides of Numeric

01:47:21.760 --> 01:47:23.760
And that's on PC, Playstation 4 and Xbox One

01:47:23.760 --> 01:47:27.760
Constructor HD on PC, Playstation 4 and Xbox One

01:47:27.760 --> 01:47:31.760
Musou Stars on Playstation 4 and the Vita

01:47:31.760 --> 01:47:33.760
And then of course a whole bunch of shit on the Nintendo Switch

01:47:33.760 --> 01:47:35.760
So of course we have

01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:37.760
1-2 Switch

01:47:37.760 --> 01:47:39.760
I am Setsuna

01:47:39.760 --> 01:47:41.760
Just Dance 2017

01:47:41.760 --> 01:47:43.760
Human Resource Machine

01:47:43.760 --> 01:47:45.760
Little Inferno, Skylanders

01:47:45.760 --> 01:47:47.760
Imaginators, The Binding of Isaac

01:47:47.760 --> 01:47:49.760
Afterbirth Plus

01:47:49.760 --> 01:47:51.760
Super Bomberman R

01:47:51.760 --> 01:47:53.760
All those on the Switch

01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:55.760
Legend of Zelda, Breath of the Wild on the Switch

01:47:55.760 --> 01:47:57.760
Wii U, World of Goo

01:47:57.760 --> 01:47:59.760
On the Switch

01:47:59.760 --> 01:48:01.760
And that would be your lineup right there

01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:03.760
World of Goo, yes

01:48:03.760 --> 01:48:05.760
That's not an old game

01:48:05.760 --> 01:48:07.760
Does that game date back to the Nintendo Wii?

01:48:07.760 --> 01:48:09.760
I think it does

01:48:09.760 --> 01:48:11.760
It's an old game

01:48:11.760 --> 01:48:13.760
It's like one of the first WiiWare games

01:48:13.760 --> 01:48:15.760
Back when it was called WiiWare

01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:18.760
Alright so moving on to Japan

01:48:18.760 --> 01:48:20.760
And checking out what's in Japan this week

01:48:20.760 --> 01:48:22.760
Horizon Zero Dawn gets its release on March 2nd

01:48:22.760 --> 01:48:25.760
As well as Winning Post 8 2017

01:48:25.760 --> 01:48:27.760
Ironically enough Loki

01:48:27.760 --> 01:48:31.760
Borderlands, the double deluxe collection

01:48:31.760 --> 01:48:33.760
What they're calling it in Japan

01:48:33.760 --> 01:48:36.760
I think this might be a price reduction though

01:48:36.760 --> 01:48:38.760
I don't think this is the initial release of the game

01:48:38.760 --> 01:48:40.760
This is funny that we were talking about it before

01:48:40.760 --> 01:48:42.760
And it's called the double deluxe collection

01:48:42.760 --> 01:48:44.760
And it's very clear on the box

01:48:44.760 --> 01:48:46.760
Borderlands the pre-sequel and Borderlands 2

01:48:46.760 --> 01:48:48.760
Are on that

01:48:48.760 --> 01:48:50.760
And that is on the Playstation 4 this week

01:48:50.760 --> 01:48:52.760
Let's see traveling over to the Vita

01:48:52.760 --> 01:48:56.760
Playstation Vita only has Winning Post 8 2017 this week

01:48:56.760 --> 01:48:58.760
Otherwise the Vita kind of has a week off

01:48:58.760 --> 01:49:00.760
Which believe it or not

01:49:00.760 --> 01:49:02.760
Yes they usually have stuff going on

01:49:02.760 --> 01:49:04.760
In Japan

01:49:04.760 --> 01:49:06.760
Nintendo 3DS has a release this week

01:49:06.760 --> 01:49:08.760
It's a Doraemon game

01:49:08.760 --> 01:49:10.760
Doraemon Nobita no Nan Kyoku

01:49:10.760 --> 01:49:12.760
Kachi Kachi Daibuken

01:49:12.760 --> 01:49:14.760
Comes out this week

01:49:14.760 --> 01:49:16.760
And it looks like some type of polar adventure

01:49:16.760 --> 01:49:18.760
For Doraemon

01:49:18.760 --> 01:49:20.760
Cause all his friends they're all wearing those big

01:49:20.760 --> 01:49:22.760
Poofy like

01:49:22.760 --> 01:49:24.760
Like Eskimo jackets type of things

01:49:24.760 --> 01:49:26.760
That's what they're wearing

01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:28.760
I love Doraemon he's so cute

01:49:28.760 --> 01:49:30.760
Well then you can check that game out

01:49:30.760 --> 01:49:32.760
And now in Japan I get to talk about the Nintendo Switch

01:49:32.760 --> 01:49:34.760
Cause the Nintendo Switch is also out this week

01:49:34.760 --> 01:49:36.760
In Japan

01:49:36.760 --> 01:49:38.760
It is a region free console don't forget

01:49:38.760 --> 01:49:40.760
So if you wanted to pick up one of these Japanese

01:49:40.760 --> 01:49:42.760
Titles you could

01:49:42.760 --> 01:49:44.760
And these are the games releasing on the Nintendo Switch this week

01:49:44.760 --> 01:49:46.760

01:50:44.760 --> 01:50:46.760
Our guess for them it was yesterday, anyway

It's already tomorrow over there, but yes

01:50:48.760 --> 01:50:50.760

Worldwide release

01:51:32.760 --> 01:51:34.760
Yo, for the Switch

01:51:34.760 --> 01:51:36.760
I'm gonna go hide in my room

01:51:36.760 --> 01:51:38.760
And raid until Mass Effect

01:51:38.760 --> 01:51:40.760
Andromeda comes out

01:51:40.760 --> 01:51:42.760
Sounds like a plan, addict

01:51:42.760 --> 01:51:44.760
Hey, you're the enabler

01:51:44.760 --> 01:51:46.760
Dealer

01:51:46.760 --> 01:51:48.760
Alright, let's go

01:51:48.760 --> 01:51:50.760
To the mailbag

01:51:50.760 --> 01:51:52.760
Every week you guys send us emails

01:51:52.760 --> 01:51:54.760
Participate at

01:51:54.760 --> 01:51:56.760
DarkSockersLoungeRadio.com

01:51:56.760 --> 01:51:58.760
Is where you can send us emails

01:51:58.760 --> 01:52:00.760
And when those emails come in, DarkSocker dives in the mailbag

01:52:00.760 --> 01:52:02.760
Headfirst and reads your emails here

01:52:02.760 --> 01:52:04.760
Live on air

01:52:04.760 --> 01:52:06.760
So DarkSocker's gonna jump into the mailbag right now

01:52:06.760 --> 01:52:08.760
And pull out

01:52:08.760 --> 01:52:10.760
Jack shit

01:52:10.760 --> 01:52:12.760
Empty mailbag

01:52:12.760 --> 01:52:14.760
Not even a crusty poop

01:52:14.760 --> 01:52:16.760
Why would you say that?

01:52:16.760 --> 01:52:18.760
Because I'm a little high on cough medicine

01:52:18.760 --> 01:52:20.760
Right now

01:52:20.760 --> 01:52:22.760
Okay, I accept that excuse

01:52:22.760 --> 01:52:24.760
Anyhow, there is no emails

01:52:24.760 --> 01:52:26.760
For DarkSocker to read this week

01:52:26.760 --> 01:52:28.760
And that makes her a sad panda

01:52:28.760 --> 01:52:30.760
Actually, it probably doesn't since she is still kinda sick

01:52:30.760 --> 01:52:32.760
She probably appreciates you all giving her voice a break

01:52:32.760 --> 01:52:34.760
I'm gonna just assume

01:52:34.760 --> 01:52:36.760
You all knew

01:52:36.760 --> 01:52:38.760
But for next week, you can email us

01:52:38.760 --> 01:52:40.760
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

01:52:40.760 --> 01:52:42.760
Guess we'll have to go back to some news

01:52:42.760 --> 01:52:44.760
Won't we, Loki?

01:52:44.760 --> 01:52:46.760
Yep, and all the things old are new again

01:52:46.760 --> 01:52:48.760
343Industry says

01:52:48.760 --> 01:52:50.760
Promise? Hey, guess what?

01:52:50.760 --> 01:52:52.760
We were briefed with Halo 5 by

01:52:52.760 --> 01:52:54.760
Taking out split screen play

01:52:54.760 --> 01:52:56.760
But that's not gonna be a problem going forward

01:52:56.760 --> 01:52:58.760
We're going to go ahead

01:52:58.760 --> 01:53:00.760
And make sure that's included

01:53:00.760 --> 01:53:02.760
In all future releases

01:53:02.760 --> 01:53:04.760
Because it was incredibly painful

01:53:04.760 --> 01:53:06.760
For the community and us

01:53:06.760 --> 01:53:08.760
That we didn't include it in Halo 5

01:53:10.760 --> 01:53:12.760
So that's pretty nice

01:53:12.760 --> 01:53:14.760
That'll be available

01:53:14.760 --> 01:53:16.760
That's a staple, so why not?

01:53:16.760 --> 01:53:18.760
Alright, so

01:53:18.760 --> 01:53:20.760
Nice, I don't know

01:53:20.760 --> 01:53:22.760
I guess I was kind of past it

01:53:22.760 --> 01:53:24.760
At this point, but I'm excited

01:53:24.760 --> 01:53:26.760
I guess a little bit to see it coming back

01:53:26.760 --> 01:53:28.760
Because my first introduction to the Halo series

01:53:28.760 --> 01:53:30.760
Was a split screen Halo thing

01:53:30.760 --> 01:53:32.760
A local area network

01:53:32.760 --> 01:53:34.760
I'm sure I've told this story on the show many times before

01:53:34.760 --> 01:53:36.760
But it was actually at a wedding reception

01:53:36.760 --> 01:53:38.760
My friend had a Halo themed wedding

01:53:38.760 --> 01:53:40.760
And they actually had Halo playable

01:53:40.760 --> 01:53:42.760
At the reception

01:53:42.760 --> 01:53:44.760
And that was my first introduction to it

01:53:44.760 --> 01:53:46.760
And it was awesome

01:53:46.760 --> 01:53:48.760
It really sold me on the original Xbox

01:53:48.760 --> 01:53:50.760
We go back to what we were talking about earlier in the show

01:53:50.760 --> 01:53:52.760
So the split screen stuff, that's pretty cool

01:53:52.760 --> 01:53:54.760
So I'm happy to hear it's coming back

01:53:54.760 --> 01:53:56.760
I think that'll be a lot of fun

01:53:56.760 --> 01:53:58.760
Alright

01:53:58.760 --> 01:54:00.760
Well, in news of That's Awkward

01:54:00.760 --> 01:54:02.760
This week

01:54:02.760 --> 01:54:04.760
And where does all the awkward stuff happen?

01:54:04.760 --> 01:54:06.760
Live streams, right?

01:54:06.760 --> 01:54:08.760
So anyway, there was a live stream this week

01:54:08.760 --> 01:54:10.760
Which is captured forever, thanks to YouTube

01:54:10.760 --> 01:54:12.760
Where

01:54:12.760 --> 01:54:14.760
I'm probably gonna say this name wrong, I'm sorry

01:54:14.760 --> 01:54:16.760
I just don't follow a lot of the streamer celebrities

01:54:16.760 --> 01:54:18.760
Really

01:54:18.760 --> 01:54:20.760
But Kefri, I think is the name of the streamer

01:54:20.760 --> 01:54:22.760
He's an Overwatch player

01:54:22.760 --> 01:54:24.760
Plays a lot of competitive Overwatch

01:54:24.760 --> 01:54:26.760
Plays so much competitive Overwatch

01:54:26.760 --> 01:54:28.760
He happens to be the highest ranked Widowmaker player in the world

01:54:28.760 --> 01:54:30.760
And Widowmaker is one of those

01:54:30.760 --> 01:54:32.760
As I call her when I'm playing the game

01:54:32.760 --> 01:54:34.760
Bitch snipers

01:54:34.760 --> 01:54:36.760
Because when I get sniped

01:54:36.760 --> 01:54:38.760
From across the map

01:54:38.760 --> 01:54:40.760
I tend to yell out, that bitch sniper killed me

01:54:40.760 --> 01:54:42.760
So, yeah

01:54:42.760 --> 01:54:44.760
But I also do like playing Widowmaker a lot

01:54:44.760 --> 01:54:46.760
Because sometimes it's really fun to be the bitch sniper

01:54:46.760 --> 01:54:48.760
So anyway

01:54:48.760 --> 01:54:50.760
Kefri is

01:54:50.760 --> 01:54:52.760
The highest ranked bitch sniper in the whole world

01:54:52.760 --> 01:54:54.760
And this was interesting

01:54:54.760 --> 01:54:56.760
Because what happened is that he was actually

01:54:56.760 --> 01:54:58.760
Playing the stream and doing some ranked matches

01:54:58.760 --> 01:55:00.760
And came across

01:55:00.760 --> 01:55:02.760
Somebody impersonating his gamer tag

01:55:02.760 --> 01:55:04.760
So had the exact same name

01:55:04.760 --> 01:55:06.760
In the game

01:55:06.760 --> 01:55:08.760
Also playing Widowmaker

01:55:08.760 --> 01:55:10.760
But as they were playing the match on Twitch

01:55:10.760 --> 01:55:12.760
They figured, oh this guy is using an aimbot

01:55:12.760 --> 01:55:14.760
He's cheating

01:55:14.760 --> 01:55:16.760
He's doing these shots you can't even do

01:55:16.760 --> 01:55:18.760
With a normal machine

01:55:18.760 --> 01:55:20.760
Basically

01:55:20.760 --> 01:55:22.760
Guess what?

01:55:22.760 --> 01:55:24.760
The real player ended up winning anyway

01:55:24.760 --> 01:55:26.760
So

01:55:26.760 --> 01:55:28.760
Even when the guy was cheating

01:55:28.760 --> 01:55:30.760
He couldn't beat the team

01:55:30.760 --> 01:55:32.760
And what's really hilarious about this is you know how

01:55:32.760 --> 01:55:34.760
One of the big things in Overwatch that's pretty awesome

01:55:34.760 --> 01:55:36.760
Is that you always get to see play of the game

01:55:36.760 --> 01:55:38.760
Which has become this whole meme online

01:55:38.760 --> 01:55:40.760
So guess who got play of the game?

01:55:40.760 --> 01:55:42.760
The real one and he even typed in chat

01:55:42.760 --> 01:55:44.760
I think at the end when all is said and done

01:55:44.760 --> 01:55:46.760
He said, can't even beat me with hacks bud

01:55:46.760 --> 01:55:48.760
Laughs

01:55:48.760 --> 01:55:50.760
You gotta love

01:55:50.760 --> 01:55:52.760
Yes, you gotta love it

01:55:52.760 --> 01:55:54.760
Usually that level of douchey snark

01:55:54.760 --> 01:55:56.760
I'm like, I don't like that stuff

01:55:56.760 --> 01:55:58.760
In the competitive scene but in this case

01:55:58.760 --> 01:56:00.760
It is completely and utterly warranted

01:56:00.760 --> 01:56:02.760
Fuck cheaters in online games

01:56:02.760 --> 01:56:04.760
Fuck them with something hard and sandpapery

01:56:04.760 --> 01:56:06.760
So this guy got what's coming to him

01:56:06.760 --> 01:56:08.760
Embarrassed on video, it's just a bummer

01:56:08.760 --> 01:56:10.760
We couldn't see what this guy's real

01:56:10.760 --> 01:56:12.760
Gamer tag was

01:56:12.760 --> 01:56:14.760
But in other words, if you're gonna go

01:56:14.760 --> 01:56:16.760
Fake, then

01:56:16.760 --> 01:56:18.760
You're probably gonna get beat

01:56:18.760 --> 01:56:20.760
Kaijuto in chat says, bleh

01:56:20.760 --> 01:56:22.760
The cheating I don't agree with

01:56:22.760 --> 01:56:24.760
But a screen name is a screen name

01:56:24.760 --> 01:56:26.760
There could be a hundred Kaijutos, I don't give a fuck

01:56:28.760 --> 01:56:30.760
Yes and no

01:56:30.760 --> 01:56:32.760
Certainly there's other people out there that must call themselves

01:56:32.760 --> 01:56:34.760
Skye because I never get the name on websites

01:56:34.760 --> 01:56:36.760
Which I actually usually don't try to take that name anymore

01:56:36.760 --> 01:56:38.760
I try to get Rob Roberts wherever I can

01:56:38.760 --> 01:56:40.760
But I digress

01:56:40.760 --> 01:56:42.760
The fact is

01:56:42.760 --> 01:56:44.760
That he's taking the name

01:56:44.760 --> 01:56:46.760
And playing Widowmaker

01:56:46.760 --> 01:56:48.760
And cheating while he's doing it

01:56:48.760 --> 01:56:50.760
Which could be

01:56:50.760 --> 01:56:52.760
Giving the impression that when

01:56:52.760 --> 01:56:54.760
Other people play against him

01:56:54.760 --> 01:56:56.760
It's the real guy

01:56:56.760 --> 01:56:58.760
Even though it's a cheater

01:56:58.760 --> 01:57:00.760
Does that make sense at all?

01:57:00.760 --> 01:57:02.760
So maybe what Blizzard needs to do

01:57:02.760 --> 01:57:04.760
And I think they actually do do this

01:57:04.760 --> 01:57:06.760
If you mouse over the gamer tag or something

01:57:06.760 --> 01:57:08.760
You get to see the numbers that are following the gamer tag

01:57:08.760 --> 01:57:10.760
So you can tell if it's the right

01:57:10.760 --> 01:57:12.760
One or not

01:57:12.760 --> 01:57:14.760
I don't know if the professionals numbers are out there for everybody to find

01:57:14.760 --> 01:57:16.760
But

01:57:16.760 --> 01:57:18.760
I kinda think intent is a big part of it

01:57:18.760 --> 01:57:20.760
And when you're using these cheating bots and so forth

01:57:20.760 --> 01:57:22.760
To play the same character

01:57:22.760 --> 01:57:24.760
That the hacker does with skill

01:57:24.760 --> 01:57:26.760
Even though apparently

01:57:26.760 --> 01:57:28.760
He's not skilled even with the hacking tool

01:57:28.760 --> 01:57:30.760
I think that's kinda shitty

01:57:30.760 --> 01:57:32.760
That's the whole thing

01:57:32.760 --> 01:57:34.760
When it's like impersonation with the intent to impersonate

01:57:34.760 --> 01:57:36.760
If it's the fact that

01:57:36.760 --> 01:57:38.760
Oh I've been using this name for years online too

01:57:38.760 --> 01:57:40.760
Well then that I understand

01:57:40.760 --> 01:57:42.760
I think I went on Twitter

01:57:42.760 --> 01:57:44.760
To try to find

01:57:44.760 --> 01:57:46.760
I want the name Rob Roberts on Twitter

01:57:46.760 --> 01:57:48.760
And it belongs to a spam account

01:57:48.760 --> 01:57:50.760
But when you search for that name

01:57:50.760 --> 01:57:52.760
You get these other Rob Roberts that come up

01:57:52.760 --> 01:57:54.760
And I think one is like a DJ in Australia or something

01:57:54.760 --> 01:57:56.760
I can't be mad at that guy

01:57:56.760 --> 01:57:58.760
That just happens to be his name too

01:57:58.760 --> 01:58:00.760
I'm not mad at that guy

01:58:00.760 --> 01:58:02.760
I'm mad that a spammer took the name Rob Roberts

01:58:02.760 --> 01:58:04.760
But if this other DJ had the name

01:58:04.760 --> 01:58:06.760
Then I really couldn't be upset

01:58:06.760 --> 01:58:08.760
Because it's his professional name too

01:58:08.760 --> 01:58:10.760
In a different way

01:58:10.760 --> 01:58:12.760
Anyway

01:58:12.760 --> 01:58:14.760
Alright let's move on

01:58:14.760 --> 01:58:16.760
DarkSakura

01:58:16.760 --> 01:58:20.760
Well we are losing one of the writers for Portal

01:58:20.760 --> 01:58:22.760
Very very sad

01:58:22.760 --> 01:58:24.760
But necessary I'm sure he thinks

01:58:24.760 --> 01:58:26.760
That it is

01:58:26.760 --> 01:58:28.760
Paul who has been with Valve since 2004

01:58:28.760 --> 01:58:30.760
Worked on Half Life 2 Episode 1

01:58:30.760 --> 01:58:32.760
Both the Portal games

01:58:32.760 --> 01:58:34.760
Left 4 Dead

01:58:34.760 --> 01:58:36.760
Has just left the company

01:58:38.760 --> 01:58:40.760
He didn't say anything about what's up next

01:58:40.760 --> 01:58:42.760
But he was working with Double Fine

01:58:42.760 --> 01:58:44.760
On Psychonauts 2

01:58:44.760 --> 01:58:46.760
So maybe it's to spend more time on that

01:58:46.760 --> 01:58:48.760
Only can speculate

01:58:48.760 --> 01:58:50.760
But

01:58:50.760 --> 01:58:52.760
Good luck and go get him

01:58:52.760 --> 01:58:54.760
Go get him

01:58:54.760 --> 01:58:56.760
Yeah

01:58:56.760 --> 01:58:58.760
Hopefully he already finished the script for Portal 3

01:58:58.760 --> 01:59:00.760
On his way out

01:59:00.760 --> 01:59:02.760
Valve can't count to three

01:59:02.760 --> 01:59:04.760
I'm not gonna hold my breath

01:59:04.760 --> 01:59:06.760
We'll see

01:59:06.760 --> 01:59:08.760
But these comings and goings happen

01:59:08.760 --> 01:59:10.760
And series can still be strong

01:59:10.760 --> 01:59:12.760
Casey Hudson left BioWare

01:59:12.760 --> 01:59:14.760
And now Mass Effect is being done by other people

01:59:14.760 --> 01:59:16.760
Which

01:59:16.760 --> 01:59:18.760
We won't really know if the story

01:59:18.760 --> 01:59:20.760
Is still good until Mass Effect Andromeda

01:59:20.760 --> 01:59:22.760
Is out we get a chance to play it

01:59:22.760 --> 01:59:24.760
But we're hopeful

01:59:24.760 --> 01:59:26.760
Did you see the voice list?

01:59:26.760 --> 01:59:28.760
I did and I also saw the

01:59:28.760 --> 01:59:30.760
Andromeda t-shirt that was on sale

01:59:30.760 --> 01:59:32.760
At Gamestop when I was at the mall

01:59:32.760 --> 01:59:34.760
So I was like oh the merchandise is out already

01:59:34.760 --> 01:59:36.760
I was also listening to

01:59:36.760 --> 01:59:38.760
Some of Natalie Dormer

01:59:38.760 --> 01:59:40.760
I heard the little interview with her

01:59:40.760 --> 01:59:42.760
It was pretty neat

01:59:42.760 --> 01:59:44.760
Very excited for the game to come out

01:59:44.760 --> 01:59:46.760
I can't wait to fuck all the aliens

01:59:46.760 --> 01:59:48.760
Alright moving on

01:59:48.760 --> 01:59:50.760
Loki

01:59:50.760 --> 01:59:52.760
The question is is Natalie Dormer one of the aliens

01:59:52.760 --> 01:59:54.760
He can fuck because you know

01:59:54.760 --> 01:59:56.760
She's the doctor

01:59:56.760 --> 01:59:58.760
Oh she's the chakwas replacement

01:59:58.760 --> 02:00:00.760
Yes she is the asari doctor

02:00:00.760 --> 02:00:02.760
I don't need to know what the profession is

02:00:02.760 --> 02:00:04.760
That's not really important

02:00:04.760 --> 02:00:06.760
No this is important because Dr. Chakwas is like

02:00:06.760 --> 02:00:08.760
She's mom

02:00:08.760 --> 02:00:10.760
She is the den mother mom of the Normandy

02:00:10.760 --> 02:00:12.760
She's very much like you know

02:00:12.760 --> 02:00:14.760
Like Kathleen Turner

02:00:14.760 --> 02:00:16.760
Like you know

02:00:16.760 --> 02:00:18.760
Why don't you come into my office and we'll

02:00:18.760 --> 02:00:20.760
Drink a glass of champagne

02:00:20.760 --> 02:00:22.760
So uh

02:00:22.760 --> 02:00:24.760
The doctor is a pretty big role

02:00:24.760 --> 02:00:26.760
Alright

02:00:26.760 --> 02:00:28.760
Well um

02:00:28.760 --> 02:00:30.760
Let's talk a little bit about

02:00:30.760 --> 02:00:32.760
Esports I guess so

02:00:32.760 --> 02:00:34.760
One thing

02:00:34.760 --> 02:00:36.760
Is coming to TV pretty soon

02:00:36.760 --> 02:00:38.760
In the weirdest locations I guess

02:00:38.760 --> 02:00:40.760
The CW network

02:00:40.760 --> 02:00:42.760
Yes that's who you think of

02:00:42.760 --> 02:00:44.760
They're going to be broadcasting

02:00:44.760 --> 02:00:46.760
I guess a tournament for

02:00:46.760 --> 02:00:48.760
H1Z1 king of the kill

02:00:48.760 --> 02:00:50.760
And so with that

02:00:50.760 --> 02:00:52.760
Along with the actual broadcast

02:00:52.760 --> 02:00:54.760
Which is supposed to air April 20th

02:00:54.760 --> 02:00:56.760
At 9pm eastern time

02:00:56.760 --> 02:00:58.760
They're going to be doing also a 5 part documentary

02:00:58.760 --> 02:01:00.760
Series leading up to the tournament

02:01:00.760 --> 02:01:02.760
And it's going to follow the um

02:01:02.760 --> 02:01:04.760
Prematch preparations

02:01:04.760 --> 02:01:06.760
Of Echo Fox

02:01:06.760 --> 02:01:08.760
The um professional esports team

02:01:08.760 --> 02:01:10.760
They got rid of top model for that

02:01:10.760 --> 02:01:12.760
What the fuck

02:01:12.760 --> 02:01:14.760
I've actually watched

02:01:14.760 --> 02:01:16.760
A little bit of king of the kill

02:01:16.760 --> 02:01:18.760
It's actually pretty interesting

02:01:18.760 --> 02:01:20.760
Since I'm sure you guys are probably not familiar with it

02:01:20.760 --> 02:01:22.760
It's basically like DayZ

02:01:22.760 --> 02:01:24.760
But put into um

02:01:24.760 --> 02:01:26.760
It almost like gets a little bit like

02:01:26.760 --> 02:01:28.760
Um

02:01:28.760 --> 02:01:30.760
Um

02:01:30.760 --> 02:01:32.760
Not the Hunger Games

02:01:32.760 --> 02:01:34.760
Sort of like the Hunger Games I guess

02:01:34.760 --> 02:01:36.760
So basically you're in this environment

02:01:36.760 --> 02:01:38.760
You land and you have to find your guns

02:01:38.760 --> 02:01:40.760
And then there's like gas coming in

02:01:40.760 --> 02:01:42.760
As well and it keeps making the

02:01:42.760 --> 02:01:44.760
Arena smaller and smaller and smaller

02:01:44.760 --> 02:01:46.760
So they're setting it up they're going to have

02:01:46.760 --> 02:01:48.760
5 man teams

02:01:48.760 --> 02:01:50.760
And there's 15 teams of 5 players

02:01:50.760 --> 02:01:52.760
And then there's also supposed to be I guess another um

02:01:52.760 --> 02:01:54.760
You know some open slots for

02:01:54.760 --> 02:01:56.760
Individual people as well

02:01:56.760 --> 02:01:58.760
But it's a lot of people that start off

02:01:58.760 --> 02:02:00.760
In the game

02:02:00.760 --> 02:02:02.760
I don't know it was entertaining why I watched it

02:02:02.760 --> 02:02:04.760
I'll have to check it out

02:02:04.760 --> 02:02:06.760
Is this a regular thing on Twitch

02:02:06.760 --> 02:02:08.760
I assume that people are playing?

02:02:08.760 --> 02:02:10.760
Yes it's one of the bigger games it's on Twitch right now

02:02:10.760 --> 02:02:12.760
Okay awesome I'll have to check that out

02:02:12.760 --> 02:02:14.760
I can take a break from Conan Exile streams

02:02:14.760 --> 02:02:16.760
Check that out

02:02:16.760 --> 02:02:18.760
So is that just all penis flailing to me?

02:02:18.760 --> 02:02:20.760
Yes never gets old

02:02:20.760 --> 02:02:22.760
Actually that game has died down in popularity a lot

02:02:22.760 --> 02:02:24.760
I think finally everybody is like alright it's a penis

02:02:24.760 --> 02:02:26.760
We get it

02:02:26.760 --> 02:02:28.760
I think Conan Exile streams have died down

02:02:28.760 --> 02:02:30.760
A little bit in popularity

02:02:30.760 --> 02:02:32.760
Has Conan played Conan Exiles because

02:02:32.760 --> 02:02:34.760
I don't know

02:02:34.760 --> 02:02:36.760
Well he's gonna have that series soon

02:02:36.760 --> 02:02:38.760
The clueless gamer

02:02:38.760 --> 02:02:40.760
Or whatever he calls it

02:02:40.760 --> 02:02:42.760
Is that on the CW?

02:02:42.760 --> 02:02:44.760
No that would be probably on

02:02:44.760 --> 02:02:46.760
Was it TBS?

02:02:46.760 --> 02:02:48.760
Actually CW has a lot of those serial

02:02:48.760 --> 02:02:50.760
Shows now right?

02:02:50.760 --> 02:02:52.760
Supernatural is fucking still going

02:02:52.760 --> 02:02:54.760
And it's still awesome

02:02:54.760 --> 02:02:56.760
All these years later

02:02:56.760 --> 02:02:58.760
All the DC shows are there

02:02:58.760 --> 02:03:00.760
Supergirl is moving there right?

02:03:00.760 --> 02:03:02.760
I'm so far behind

02:03:02.760 --> 02:03:04.760
On all that stuff

02:03:04.760 --> 02:03:06.760
I have to ask John from

02:03:06.760 --> 02:03:08.760
Critical Myth because he still follows

02:03:08.760 --> 02:03:10.760
All those shows and they write some great reviews

02:03:10.760 --> 02:03:12.760
Over at VOG Network but I admittedly

02:03:12.760 --> 02:03:14.760
Don't follow a lot of them

02:03:14.760 --> 02:03:16.760
However I will say this

02:03:16.760 --> 02:03:18.760
Dark Soccer maybe this is something you know about this

02:03:18.760 --> 02:03:20.760
I realize this has nothing to do with games but it's very

02:03:20.760 --> 02:03:22.760
Important

02:03:22.760 --> 02:03:24.760
Can somebody explain to me why

02:03:24.760 --> 02:03:26.760
Riverdale is so popular

02:03:26.760 --> 02:03:28.760
I haven't watched it

02:03:28.760 --> 02:03:30.760
It sounds kind of amazing

02:03:30.760 --> 02:03:32.760
When I first heard about Riverdale I was like

02:03:32.760 --> 02:03:34.760
Oh they're turning Archie from the comics

02:03:34.760 --> 02:03:36.760
Into one of these shows that's gonna be a little ridiculous

02:03:36.760 --> 02:03:38.760
But apparently it's like

02:03:38.760 --> 02:03:40.760
Archie but like if all those characters

02:03:40.760 --> 02:03:42.760
Were in Twin Peaks

02:03:42.760 --> 02:03:44.760
What? Yeah that's what Riverdale

02:03:44.760 --> 02:03:46.760
Is

02:03:46.760 --> 02:03:48.760
It's like the dark version of

02:03:48.760 --> 02:03:50.760
Archie

02:03:50.760 --> 02:03:52.760
And it's all the same people like Veronica

02:03:52.760 --> 02:03:54.760
Fucking Josie from Josie and the Pussycats

02:03:54.760 --> 02:03:56.760
Is there too like it's yeah right?

02:03:56.760 --> 02:03:58.760
That's the same face timing

02:03:58.760 --> 02:04:00.760
They decided

02:04:00.760 --> 02:04:02.760
We're gonna take

02:04:02.760 --> 02:04:04.760
We're gonna take Batman

02:04:04.760 --> 02:04:06.760
And make it dark

02:04:06.760 --> 02:04:08.760
Is that Happily Ever After?

02:04:08.760 --> 02:04:10.760
Or something like that?

02:04:10.760 --> 02:04:12.760
What's that show that's with all the Disney

02:04:12.760 --> 02:04:14.760
Oh Once Upon a Time

02:04:14.760 --> 02:04:16.760
Once Upon a Time is that like

02:04:16.760 --> 02:04:18.760
Once Upon a Time but in the Archie universe now?

02:04:18.760 --> 02:04:20.760
Yes

02:04:20.760 --> 02:04:22.760
Something like that I don't know

02:04:22.760 --> 02:04:24.760
But apparently everybody I've seen on the Twitters

02:04:24.760 --> 02:04:26.760
And all the stuff like Tumblr

02:04:26.760 --> 02:04:28.760
They're putting shit up like there's

02:04:28.760 --> 02:04:30.760
Gifts everywhere

02:04:30.760 --> 02:04:32.760
And everything so I don't know

02:04:32.760 --> 02:04:34.760
I feel like it's one of those shows I need to be

02:04:34.760 --> 02:04:36.760
Seeing let's see I'm looking in chat

02:04:36.760 --> 02:04:38.760
Over at live.vognetwork.com

02:04:38.760 --> 02:04:40.760
Come on Noel Gus says Riverdale is pretty good

02:04:40.760 --> 02:04:42.760
Brad from Pod Culture says

02:04:42.760 --> 02:04:44.760
Supergirl is there I follow

02:04:44.760 --> 02:04:46.760
All of them love Legends of Tomorrow

02:04:46.760 --> 02:04:48.760
I know they started putting some of that on

02:04:48.760 --> 02:04:50.760
Netflix so

02:04:50.760 --> 02:04:52.760
I tried to see if Riverdale

02:04:52.760 --> 02:04:54.760
If I ever stop hating on DC maybe I'll give them a chance

02:04:54.760 --> 02:04:56.760
One of these days but no thanks

02:04:56.760 --> 02:04:58.760
Where can I watch Riverdale online?

02:04:58.760 --> 02:05:00.760
I would totally watch it

02:05:00.760 --> 02:05:02.760
But it's not on Netflix

02:05:02.760 --> 02:05:04.760
New shows usually aren't

02:05:04.760 --> 02:05:06.760
Hulu I've been using

02:05:06.760 --> 02:05:08.760
I have a friend that I may or may not

02:05:08.760 --> 02:05:10.760
Be borrowing their Hulu account

02:05:10.760 --> 02:05:12.760
So I can watch Golden Girls

02:05:12.760 --> 02:05:14.760
And I tried to see I was like

02:05:14.760 --> 02:05:16.760
Oh maybe usually that type of stuff shows up there

02:05:16.760 --> 02:05:18.760
But there's no Riverdale on Hulu either

02:05:18.760 --> 02:05:20.760
But that's fine because I still have like

02:05:20.760 --> 02:05:22.760
160 episodes of Golden Girls left to watch

02:05:22.760 --> 02:05:24.760
Thank you a couple weekends

02:05:24.760 --> 02:05:26.760
It will take me a little while

02:05:26.760 --> 02:05:28.760
Maybe by then you know the new season of

02:05:28.760 --> 02:05:30.760
Stranger Things will be out so

02:05:30.760 --> 02:05:32.760
Oh there's a CW app that's apparently

02:05:32.760 --> 02:05:34.760
totally free

02:05:34.760 --> 02:05:36.760
Like on

02:05:36.760 --> 02:05:38.760
Playstation or Xbox

02:05:38.760 --> 02:05:40.760
The Android TV

02:05:40.760 --> 02:05:42.760
The Play Store has that and I'm like

02:05:42.760 --> 02:05:44.760
Oh CW what the hell do I need this for

02:05:44.760 --> 02:05:46.760
Maybe they have

02:05:46.760 --> 02:05:48.760
Because my fucking TV has apps

02:05:48.760 --> 02:05:50.760
So maybe it's like a Samsung TV

02:05:50.760 --> 02:05:52.760
Because Netflix is built into my TV

02:05:52.760 --> 02:05:54.760
So maybe they have that

02:05:54.760 --> 02:05:56.760
I'm going to look for that stuff

02:05:56.760 --> 02:05:58.760
Oh Rama says Comcast on Demand

02:05:58.760 --> 02:06:00.760
Thank you Rama

02:06:00.760 --> 02:06:02.760
I have Comcast on Demand

02:06:02.760 --> 02:06:04.760
I never use it but I will check out this show

02:06:04.760 --> 02:06:06.760
Because I'm very curious

02:06:06.760 --> 02:06:08.760
I have a purpose now for Comcast on Demand

02:06:08.760 --> 02:06:10.760
Alright

02:06:10.760 --> 02:06:12.760
DarkSakura why are you telling people to fight you in chat

02:06:12.760 --> 02:06:14.760
What are you doing

02:06:14.760 --> 02:06:16.760
Shots have been fired

02:06:16.760 --> 02:06:18.760
Why what was fired

02:06:18.760 --> 02:06:20.760
Brad says that DC is better than Marvel

02:06:20.760 --> 02:06:22.760
for TV and I'm like

02:06:22.760 --> 02:06:24.760
Marvel is better than DC for everything

02:06:24.760 --> 02:06:26.760
Brad's been saying that you two

02:06:26.760 --> 02:06:28.760
go back and forth on the DC and

02:06:28.760 --> 02:06:30.760
Marvel thing for forever

02:06:30.760 --> 02:06:32.760
I haven't watched really any of them so I can't make a judgement

02:06:32.760 --> 02:06:34.760
at this point

02:06:34.760 --> 02:06:36.760
I think you and Brad need to do a podcast

02:06:36.760 --> 02:06:38.760
together called Fight Me

02:06:38.760 --> 02:06:40.760
and it's just a DC

02:06:40.760 --> 02:06:42.760
Marvel wank fest every week

02:06:42.760 --> 02:06:44.760
I don't even like DC enough to entertain

02:06:44.760 --> 02:06:46.760
that it might be good

02:06:46.760 --> 02:06:48.760
You're such a bitch

02:06:48.760 --> 02:06:50.760
and I love it

02:06:50.760 --> 02:06:52.760
I like Suicide Squad

02:06:52.760 --> 02:06:54.760
Because you know what

02:06:54.760 --> 02:06:56.760
it wasn't quite like they were in the comics

02:06:56.760 --> 02:06:58.760
Actually I'll tell you this right now

02:06:58.760 --> 02:07:00.760
I have gone back to buying physical comic books

02:07:00.760 --> 02:07:02.760
again because of one fucking series

02:07:02.760 --> 02:07:04.760
I now have a new

02:07:04.760 --> 02:07:06.760
series of Jessica Jones

02:07:06.760 --> 02:07:08.760
in comics

02:07:08.760 --> 02:07:10.760
just focused on her

02:07:10.760 --> 02:07:12.760
in the actual comic universe and not the TV universe

02:07:12.760 --> 02:07:14.760
and it's perfect

02:07:14.760 --> 02:07:16.760
Here's the thing

02:07:16.760 --> 02:07:18.760
Dark Soccer and I know you're going to plug your ears and say

02:07:18.760 --> 02:07:20.760
la la la but I'm going to try anyway

02:07:20.760 --> 02:07:22.760
You should give

02:07:22.760 --> 02:07:24.760
if you're going to give any of this shit a chance

02:07:24.760 --> 02:07:26.760
try Supergirl

02:07:26.760 --> 02:07:28.760
Everything I've heard about that show

02:07:28.760 --> 02:07:30.760
I feel like you might dig it

02:07:30.760 --> 02:07:32.760
Okay I will admit this

02:07:32.760 --> 02:07:34.760
I do have Supergirl on DVD

02:07:34.760 --> 02:07:36.760
because I fucking love that movie as a kid

02:07:36.760 --> 02:07:38.760
I'm not even talking about the fucking movie

02:07:38.760 --> 02:07:40.760
But

02:07:40.760 --> 02:07:42.760
But

02:07:42.760 --> 02:07:44.760
I have considered

02:07:44.760 --> 02:07:46.760
giving the TV show a try

02:07:46.760 --> 02:07:48.760
because of my love for the old movie

02:07:48.760 --> 02:07:50.760
There you go and the old movie is not even

02:07:50.760 --> 02:07:52.760
that good you guys

02:07:52.760 --> 02:07:54.760
I don't fucking care because it has

02:07:54.760 --> 02:07:56.760
Faye Dunaway in it as the bad guy

02:07:56.760 --> 02:07:58.760
I just want to remind you all this chick stands

02:07:58.760 --> 02:08:00.760
for Xanadu

02:08:00.760 --> 02:08:02.760
I love Xanadu

02:08:02.760 --> 02:08:04.760
You shut up about Xanadu because you know what

02:08:04.760 --> 02:08:06.760
Don Bluth

02:08:06.760 --> 02:08:08.760
In the studios took time out of their

02:08:08.760 --> 02:08:10.760
busy schedule producing

02:08:10.760 --> 02:08:12.760
The Secret of Nim

02:08:12.760 --> 02:08:14.760
No no The Secret of Nim at the time

02:08:14.760 --> 02:08:16.760
to do Xanadu

02:08:16.760 --> 02:08:18.760
to do that one little bit in Xanadu

02:08:18.760 --> 02:08:20.760
and almost delayed the release of

02:08:20.760 --> 02:08:22.760
The Secret of Nim which is also

02:08:22.760 --> 02:08:24.760
one of my other favorite fucking movies of all time so don't judge me

02:08:24.760 --> 02:08:26.760
I will fight everyone

02:08:26.760 --> 02:08:28.760
Here's Brad from Pod Culture with the

02:08:28.760 --> 02:08:30.760
selling line

02:08:30.760 --> 02:08:32.760
The chick from the original movie plays

02:08:32.760 --> 02:08:34.760
Supergirl's adopted mom on the show

02:08:34.760 --> 02:08:36.760
I sold

02:08:36.760 --> 02:08:38.760
Oh fuck

02:08:38.760 --> 02:08:40.760
I know her name

02:08:40.760 --> 02:08:42.760
Helen something

02:08:42.760 --> 02:08:44.760
How did I know that?

02:08:44.760 --> 02:08:46.760
How did I know that?

02:08:46.760 --> 02:08:48.760
You know what else she was in?

02:08:48.760 --> 02:08:50.760
She was in The Legend of Billie Jean

02:08:50.760 --> 02:08:52.760
I feel like I had to tap into gay superpowers

02:08:52.760 --> 02:08:54.760
to remember that

02:08:54.760 --> 02:08:56.760
We just have a knack for pop culture

02:08:56.760 --> 02:08:58.760
The Legend of Billie Jean was also a great movie

02:08:58.760 --> 02:09:00.760
Alright

02:09:00.760 --> 02:09:02.760
Moving on

02:09:02.760 --> 02:09:04.760
Let's talk about

02:09:04.760 --> 02:09:06.760
Let's talk about an awesome series on the Atari 2600

02:09:06.760 --> 02:09:08.760
that you may or may not have ever played

02:09:08.760 --> 02:09:10.760
It's Sword Quest

02:09:10.760 --> 02:09:12.760
Did you ever play these Sword Quest games?

02:09:12.760 --> 02:09:14.760
They were kind of hard to understand

02:09:14.760 --> 02:09:16.760
especially at a young age that I was

02:09:16.760 --> 02:09:18.760
when these games first came out

02:09:18.760 --> 02:09:20.760
They were kind of like a bunch of mini games

02:09:20.760 --> 02:09:22.760
but they all came together for this larger purpose

02:09:22.760 --> 02:09:24.760
of you were trying to look for

02:09:24.760 --> 02:09:26.760
items and traverse the kingdom

02:09:26.760 --> 02:09:28.760
and all this stuff

02:09:28.760 --> 02:09:30.760
1982 was when the first game in the series

02:09:30.760 --> 02:09:32.760
came out it was Earthworld

02:09:32.760 --> 02:09:34.760
and then finally Fireworld

02:09:34.760 --> 02:09:36.760
came out in 1983

02:09:36.760 --> 02:09:38.760
and 1983 unfortunately

02:09:38.760 --> 02:09:40.760
is when the video game industry went

02:09:40.760 --> 02:09:42.760
so the series was never really finished

02:09:42.760 --> 02:09:44.760
Waterworld

02:09:44.760 --> 02:09:46.760
did I think get released

02:09:46.760 --> 02:09:48.760
really limitedly

02:09:48.760 --> 02:09:50.760
through Club Atari and I think you can

02:09:50.760 --> 02:09:52.760
get it on some of the flashback stuff

02:09:52.760 --> 02:09:54.760
now and then Airworld

02:09:54.760 --> 02:09:56.760
which was supposed to be the last game was never made

02:09:56.760 --> 02:09:58.760
and the interesting thing about this series is that

02:09:58.760 --> 02:10:00.760
there was a prize like it was supposed to be like

02:10:00.760 --> 02:10:02.760
if you were the first person to crack the code

02:10:02.760 --> 02:10:04.760
you got this prize thing

02:10:04.760 --> 02:10:06.760
that was worth like a quarter million dollars

02:10:06.760 --> 02:10:08.760
which in the 80's was a lot more

02:10:08.760 --> 02:10:10.760
money than it is today and so it was like

02:10:10.760 --> 02:10:12.760
a lot of money but they never ended up having to

02:10:12.760 --> 02:10:14.760
give the thing away because they never really

02:10:14.760 --> 02:10:16.760
finished the series. Here's what's interesting

02:10:16.760 --> 02:10:18.760
Dynamite Entertainment has picked up

02:10:18.760 --> 02:10:20.760
the rights to Sword Quest they are

02:10:20.760 --> 02:10:22.760
going to launch a comic book series

02:10:22.760 --> 02:10:24.760
beginning in May

02:10:24.760 --> 02:10:26.760
to actually finish

02:10:26.760 --> 02:10:28.760
the story of Sword Quest

02:10:28.760 --> 02:10:30.760
which Atari 2600 games

02:10:30.760 --> 02:10:32.760
didn't have much story

02:10:32.760 --> 02:10:34.760
I seem to remember these games

02:10:34.760 --> 02:10:36.760
I think were like comic book style manuals

02:10:36.760 --> 02:10:38.760
of their own that told a story

02:10:38.760 --> 02:10:40.760
so it's interesting that it's all

02:10:40.760 --> 02:10:42.760
coming back so that's cool

02:10:42.760 --> 02:10:44.760
the creative team

02:10:44.760 --> 02:10:46.760
behind Sword Quest is going to be

02:10:46.760 --> 02:10:48.760
Chris Simms who wrote Marvel's

02:10:48.760 --> 02:10:50.760
X-Men 92 series

02:10:50.760 --> 02:10:52.760
and artist Scott

02:10:52.760 --> 02:10:54.760
Kolichuk who did Batman

02:10:54.760 --> 02:10:56.760
66 for a bit

02:10:56.760 --> 02:10:58.760
so that's pretty cool so check that

02:10:58.760 --> 02:11:00.760
out because who knows if the Sword

02:11:00.760 --> 02:11:02.760
Quest comic does well maybe it

02:11:02.760 --> 02:11:04.760
will become a video game movie that doesn't

02:11:04.760 --> 02:11:06.760
suck we'll see

02:11:06.760 --> 02:11:08.760
anyway one more story for you guys

02:11:42.760 --> 02:11:44.760
Humanity has teamed up

02:11:44.760 --> 02:11:46.760
with BioWare for a mass

02:11:46.760 --> 02:11:48.760
effect pack and I

02:11:48.760 --> 02:11:50.760
found out how many you can order at one time

02:11:50.760 --> 02:11:52.760
three packs it's a dollar

02:11:52.760 --> 02:11:54.760
a pack you fucking owe it to yourself

02:11:54.760 --> 02:11:56.760
to not only buy the packs

02:11:56.760 --> 02:11:58.760
but

02:11:58.760 --> 02:12:00.760
also look at the beautiful fan art on the

02:12:00.760 --> 02:12:02.760
page it's absolutely hilarious

02:12:02.760 --> 02:12:04.760
but you will have to understand mass effect

02:12:04.760 --> 02:12:06.760
a little bit for this deck to make any

02:12:06.760 --> 02:12:08.760
sense at all right it's just a pack

02:12:08.760 --> 02:12:10.760
but yeah yes but

02:12:10.760 --> 02:12:12.760

02:12:12.760 --> 02:12:14.760
Cards Against Humanity pack and like have

02:12:14.760 --> 02:12:16.760
a party or whatever and your friends

02:12:16.760 --> 02:12:18.760
like we invite Loki over and Loki doesn't play

02:12:18.760 --> 02:12:20.760
mass effect he's not going to fucking get it

02:12:20.760 --> 02:12:22.760
he's not going to get any of it

02:12:22.760 --> 02:12:24.760
if anyone hangs out with me

02:12:24.760 --> 02:12:26.760
they will get my mass effect references because I've

02:12:26.760 --> 02:12:28.760
explained them and yes

02:12:28.760 --> 02:12:30.760
I do have to thank Ranma I've actually

02:12:30.760 --> 02:12:32.760
reposted this on masseffecting.tumblr.com

02:12:32.760 --> 02:12:34.760
which is my mass effect blog

02:12:34.760 --> 02:12:36.760
by the way I'm trying to get to

02:12:36.760 --> 02:12:38.760
10,000 followers

02:12:38.760 --> 02:12:40.760
you have 10,000 followers?

02:12:40.760 --> 02:12:42.760
I have 9,400 and something right now

02:12:42.760 --> 02:12:44.760
I'm trying to get to 10,000

02:12:44.760 --> 02:12:46.760
because if I get to 10,000

02:12:46.760 --> 02:12:48.760
I get to 3 with those kind of numbers

02:12:48.760 --> 02:12:50.760
maybe

02:12:50.760 --> 02:12:52.760
I don't know

02:12:52.760 --> 02:12:54.760
I swear to god if her mass

02:12:54.760 --> 02:12:56.760
her mass effecting blog is more

02:12:56.760 --> 02:12:58.760
popular than anything on fog network

02:12:58.760 --> 02:13:00.760
well I do

02:13:00.760 --> 02:13:02.760
plug the show on my blog

02:13:02.760 --> 02:13:04.760
I appreciate that we know what we need

02:13:04.760 --> 02:13:06.760
more alien penis I know that's right

02:13:06.760 --> 02:13:08.760
what video game can I exploit

02:13:08.760 --> 02:13:10.760
the alien penis out of?

02:13:10.760 --> 02:13:12.760
we take the engine

02:13:12.760 --> 02:13:14.760
of the Conan

02:13:14.760 --> 02:13:16.760
yes

02:13:16.760 --> 02:13:18.760
and cross it with mass effect

02:13:18.760 --> 02:13:20.760
mass effect exiles

02:13:20.760 --> 02:13:22.760
totally changeable penis.com

02:13:22.760 --> 02:13:24.760
perfect

02:13:24.760 --> 02:13:26.760
you know how mass effecting started

02:13:26.760 --> 02:13:28.760
you had like

02:13:28.760 --> 02:13:30.760
one thing that got a million notes

02:13:30.760 --> 02:13:32.760
or something and you were like I should exploit this

02:13:32.760 --> 02:13:34.760
for an entire blog

02:13:34.760 --> 02:13:36.760
I was looking at one of my screen caps

02:13:36.760 --> 02:13:38.760
and it's one of the Turian characters cross eyed

02:13:38.760 --> 02:13:40.760
so I just wrote

02:13:40.760 --> 02:13:42.760
derpians under it and posted it on my blog

02:13:42.760 --> 02:13:44.760
because I thought it was funny

02:13:44.760 --> 02:13:46.760
cause that's what fucking happens on tumblr

02:13:46.760 --> 02:13:48.760
outside of the pornography

02:13:48.760 --> 02:13:50.760
I did have to do a little research cause I knew there was tons of porn

02:13:50.760 --> 02:13:52.760
on tumblr I mean hello

02:13:52.760 --> 02:13:54.760
but if you actually like did like what is tumblr

02:13:54.760 --> 02:13:56.760
really supposed to be for

02:13:56.760 --> 02:13:58.760
like what they told yahoo to buy it for

02:13:58.760 --> 02:14:00.760
is just random

02:14:00.760 --> 02:14:02.760
shit like what just dark soccer explained

02:14:02.760 --> 02:14:04.760
for the most part it is just random shit

02:14:04.760 --> 02:14:06.760
it's memes

02:14:06.760 --> 02:14:08.760
dank fucking memes

02:14:08.760 --> 02:14:10.760
but like I went from doing like one or so a week

02:14:10.760 --> 02:14:12.760
to now doing one every fucking day

02:14:12.760 --> 02:14:14.760
to the point that I have managed to get

02:14:14.760 --> 02:14:16.760
out of doing two days worth of them

02:14:16.760 --> 02:14:18.760
by having a blank

02:14:18.760 --> 02:14:20.760
one go up as a caption contest

02:14:20.760 --> 02:14:22.760
and picking the winner at the end of the week

02:14:22.760 --> 02:14:24.760

02:14:24.760 --> 02:14:26.760

02:17:16.760 --> 02:17:18.760
lounge radio alright

02:17:18.760 --> 02:17:20.760
loki why don't you finish up their thought

02:17:20.760 --> 02:17:22.760
then so they apparently rent

02:17:22.760 --> 02:17:24.760
public road carts

02:17:24.760 --> 02:17:26.760
to any customer and they lend I guess a costume

02:17:26.760 --> 02:17:28.760
of one of the characters

02:17:28.760 --> 02:17:30.760
and then of course you

02:17:30.760 --> 02:17:32.760
drive around and stuff so

02:17:32.760 --> 02:17:34.760
and nintendo doesn't

02:17:34.760 --> 02:17:36.760
like that because you know it's

02:17:36.760 --> 02:17:38.760
um infringing on their

02:17:38.760 --> 02:17:40.760

02:17:40.760 --> 02:17:42.760

something may come of this anyway

02:21:04.760 --> 02:21:06.760
William Ritterface says loki has to dress as tingle

02:21:06.760 --> 02:21:08.760
well that won't happen but maybe

02:21:08.760 --> 02:21:10.760
we could get him to play the tingle

02:21:10.760 --> 02:21:12.760
game on 3DS or something

02:21:12.760 --> 02:21:14.760
you don't have a problem playing a game with tingle in it

02:21:14.760 --> 02:21:16.760
yeah it's a little

02:21:16.760 --> 02:21:18.760
I like to force him to work on his game

02:21:18.760 --> 02:21:20.760

02:21:20.760 --> 02:21:22.760

your skype is on one side of the room

02:21:30.760 --> 02:21:32.760
and you're on the other side of the room yelling

02:21:32.760 --> 02:21:34.760
at it

02:21:34.760 --> 02:21:36.760
here's the thing I went out and decided

02:21:36.760 --> 02:21:38.760
to update one of the

02:21:38.760 --> 02:21:40.760
usb adapters I do my podcast

02:21:40.760 --> 02:21:42.760

02:21:42.760 --> 02:21:44.760
for the secondary device

02:21:44.760 --> 02:21:46.760
for music

02:21:46.760 --> 02:21:48.760
skype doesn't pay attention so

02:21:48.760 --> 02:21:50.760
when the call picked up I'm like

02:21:50.760 --> 02:21:52.760

02:21:52.760 --> 02:21:54.760

02:21:56.760 --> 02:21:58.760
I wasn't going to tell everybody you were that

02:21:58.760 --> 02:22:00.760
fail call a minute ago but if you're going to

02:22:00.760 --> 02:22:02.760
out yourself as that then fine

02:22:02.760 --> 02:22:04.760
I have no problem owning up to that

02:22:04.760 --> 02:22:06.760
I really don't because in between

02:22:06.760 --> 02:22:08.760
that the fact that

02:22:08.760 --> 02:22:10.760
I am missing half a carpet in my apartment

02:22:10.760 --> 02:22:12.760
and the fact that I went IKEA shopping for

02:22:12.760 --> 02:22:14.760
new furniture has been quite a week

02:22:14.760 --> 02:22:16.760

02:22:18.760 --> 02:22:20.760
two things I want to agree

02:22:20.760 --> 02:22:22.760
with you on Cards Against Humanity

02:22:22.760 --> 02:22:24.760

out to conventions and certain events

02:22:26.760 --> 02:22:28.760
I have to go through

02:22:28.760 --> 02:22:30.760
my decks and take out certain

02:22:30.760 --> 02:22:32.760

02:22:32.760 --> 02:22:34.760
do not get confused

02:22:34.760 --> 02:22:36.760
oddly enough everyone who plays

02:22:36.760 --> 02:22:38.760
this game are die hard gamers

02:22:38.760 --> 02:22:40.760

02:22:40.760 --> 02:22:42.760
have like anime expansions

02:22:42.760 --> 02:22:44.760
that if you tried to play with me I'd be like

02:22:44.760 --> 02:22:46.760
I this sounds like it

02:22:46.760 --> 02:22:48.760
might be funny actually

02:22:48.760 --> 02:22:50.760
no the most you probably get

02:22:50.760 --> 02:22:52.760
confused with is the Cards Against

02:22:52.760 --> 02:22:54.760
New York Cards Against Brooklyn expansion

02:22:54.760 --> 02:22:56.760
packs but you will pick up on that pretty

02:22:56.760 --> 02:22:58.760
quick I think that I could

02:22:58.760 --> 02:23:00.760
probably figure out I watch

02:23:00.760 --> 02:23:02.760
enough cop shows

02:23:02.760 --> 02:23:04.760
yeah I can kind of agree with that

02:23:04.760 --> 02:23:06.760
what's the other thing

02:23:06.760 --> 02:23:08.760
alright I'm coming I'm listening

02:23:08.760 --> 02:23:10.760
to the shows which is why I was kind of late

02:23:10.760 --> 02:23:12.760
getting the classic game in a week

02:23:12.760 --> 02:23:14.760
up I want to give a shout out

02:23:14.760 --> 02:23:16.760
to Jamie

02:23:16.760 --> 02:23:18.760
ah the switch

02:23:18.760 --> 02:23:20.760
the switch

02:23:20.760 --> 02:23:22.760
I think we're probably the only

02:23:22.760 --> 02:23:24.760
two that get that

02:23:24.760 --> 02:23:26.760
when you said when you said

02:23:26.760 --> 02:23:28.760
that somebody have to go out in the back

02:23:28.760 --> 02:23:30.760
oh yeah

02:23:30.760 --> 02:23:32.760
yes I've told

02:23:32.760 --> 02:23:34.760
friends of mine stories of me

02:23:34.760 --> 02:23:36.760
go out and get the switch

02:23:36.760 --> 02:23:38.760
now you try to be a smart ass

02:23:38.760 --> 02:23:40.760
and get like the smallest switch possible

02:23:40.760 --> 02:23:42.760
and you think that oh

02:23:42.760 --> 02:23:44.760
this will be an easy beating no

02:23:44.760 --> 02:23:46.760
your mom still or your grandmother finds a way

02:23:46.760 --> 02:23:48.760
to take this little switch

02:23:48.760 --> 02:23:50.760
give you a sound beating and send you

02:23:50.760 --> 02:23:52.760
back outside for a regulation size one

02:23:52.760 --> 02:23:54.760
for round two oh no no no no

02:23:54.760 --> 02:23:56.760
it was always you had to get something that

02:23:56.760 --> 02:23:58.760
was right in between

02:23:58.760 --> 02:24:00.760
the really

02:24:00.760 --> 02:24:02.760
thin ones or a log

02:24:04.760 --> 02:24:06.760
I'm going to have to be right in the middle of that

02:24:06.760 --> 02:24:08.760
a switch is just the southern

02:24:08.760 --> 02:24:10.760
version of the belt

02:24:10.760 --> 02:24:12.760
or la chancla right

02:24:14.760 --> 02:24:16.760
the switch is literally you go

02:24:16.760 --> 02:24:18.760
and you find the camellia bush in your backyard

02:24:18.760 --> 02:24:20.760
you pick it off

02:24:20.760 --> 02:24:22.760
you pick all the leaves off of it

02:24:22.760 --> 02:24:24.760
and you pray that you've gotten all the little

02:24:24.760 --> 02:24:26.760
nubby bits too

02:24:26.760 --> 02:24:28.760
see I didn't have that

02:24:28.760 --> 02:24:30.760
where I lived they were

02:24:30.760 --> 02:24:32.760
yellow honeysuckle

02:24:32.760 --> 02:24:34.760
branches and bushes growing

02:24:34.760 --> 02:24:36.760
that's where I had to pick it from

02:24:38.760 --> 02:24:40.760
it was either camellias or azaleas

02:24:40.760 --> 02:24:42.760
azaleas or camellias

02:24:42.760 --> 02:24:44.760
and for the record

02:24:44.760 --> 02:24:46.760
la chancla is the thong

02:24:46.760 --> 02:24:48.760
shoes that when you piss

02:24:48.760 --> 02:24:50.760
mom off she's going to take off her chancla

02:24:50.760 --> 02:24:52.760
and beat you with it yeah

02:24:52.760 --> 02:24:54.760
there is a shirt that says I survived la chancla

02:24:54.760 --> 02:24:56.760
but we never used footwear because footwear

02:24:56.760 --> 02:24:58.760
in the south is all cowboy boots that would murder a child

02:25:00.760 --> 02:25:02.760
this murders the child

02:25:04.760 --> 02:25:06.760
alright

02:25:06.760 --> 02:25:08.760
you just want to make them wish they were dead

02:25:08.760 --> 02:25:10.760
rama anything else you want to share with us tonight

02:25:10.760 --> 02:25:12.760
I ran

02:25:12.760 --> 02:25:14.760
the two japanese girls on the train

02:25:14.760 --> 02:25:16.760
and they were amused by

02:25:16.760 --> 02:25:18.760
my wireless

02:25:18.760 --> 02:25:20.760
headphones because you have custom

02:25:20.760 --> 02:25:22.760
ear pads on them mine has the

02:25:22.760 --> 02:25:24.760
one half logo on them they found it quite cute

02:25:24.760 --> 02:25:26.760
I have not seen

02:25:26.760 --> 02:25:28.760
these headphones I bet it was adorable

02:25:28.760 --> 02:25:30.760
if you go to vmoda and you get

02:25:30.760 --> 02:25:32.760
the wireless crossfades you can get

02:25:32.760 --> 02:25:34.760
custom 2d and 3d engraving

02:25:34.760 --> 02:25:36.760

a retro mood so I think I'm gonna end up doing something

02:28:46.760 --> 02:28:48.760
virtual console I just haven't decided yet

02:28:48.760 --> 02:28:50.760
so you know it is on virtual console I started

02:28:50.760 --> 02:28:52.760
and it already annoyed me hmm

02:28:52.760 --> 02:28:54.760

02:29:06.760 --> 02:29:08.760
all right well nobody

02:29:08.760 --> 02:29:10.760

for calls tonight I know a lot of our

02:29:12.760 --> 02:29:14.760

02:30:04.760 --> 02:30:06.760
Disney movie do you know

02:30:06.760 --> 02:30:08.760

02:30:10.760 --> 02:30:12.760

02:30:16.760 --> 02:30:18.760
animated storyboard like animated scenes

02:30:18.760 --> 02:30:20.760

says no best picture yet

02:30:28.760 --> 02:30:30.760
but the director just won I'm assuming the

02:30:30.760 --> 02:30:32.760
director for La La Land won

02:30:32.760 --> 02:30:34.760
what the fuck ever and usually usually

02:30:34.760 --> 02:30:36.760
the director and the picture are the same thing actually

02:30:36.760 --> 02:30:38.760
not all the past couple years that trend's been

02:30:38.760 --> 02:30:40.760
broken I think they've they've split

02:30:40.760 --> 02:30:42.760
up a little bit so

02:30:42.760 --> 02:30:44.760

uh Loki your final thought tonight

02:31:36.760 --> 02:31:38.760
uh my final

02:31:38.760 --> 02:31:40.760
thought is um

02:31:40.760 --> 02:31:42.760
I guess I'll work on my game

02:31:42.760 --> 02:31:44.760
good answer a game I don't know which

02:31:44.760 --> 02:31:46.760
one cause I have started like a million of them

02:31:46.760 --> 02:31:48.760
uh Loki uh

02:31:48.760 --> 02:31:50.760
my final thought is I can't wait to uh

02:31:50.760 --> 02:31:52.760
play with these little mini arcade machines that Dark

02:31:52.760 --> 02:31:54.760
Sakura bought me although now I'm

02:31:54.760 --> 02:31:56.760
at that point where I'm like do I leave him in the

02:31:56.760 --> 02:31:58.760
box as a collector or do I take

02:31:58.760 --> 02:32:00.760
yeah I feel like I have to

02:32:00.760 --> 02:32:02.760
take them out of the box and actually play them

02:32:02.760 --> 02:32:04.760
they're not gonna go

02:32:04.760 --> 02:32:06.760
up in value that much

02:32:06.760 --> 02:32:08.760
you should find these things on eBay

02:32:08.760 --> 02:32:10.760
actually people are flipping them on eBay I couldn't believe it

02:32:10.760 --> 02:32:12.760
these people are dumb

02:32:12.760 --> 02:32:14.760
and lastly but not leastly Dark Sakura

02:32:14.760 --> 02:32:16.760
two things

02:32:16.760 --> 02:32:18.760
I want this fucking sinus

02:32:18.760 --> 02:32:20.760
infection to go the fuck away

02:32:20.760 --> 02:32:22.760
and we didn't do the FUs of the week

02:32:22.760 --> 02:32:24.760
no we haven't been

02:32:24.760 --> 02:32:26.760
funny enough we talked about that last week we haven't been

02:32:26.760 --> 02:32:28.760
for a while actually

02:32:28.760 --> 02:32:30.760
it was noticed that we've kind of been missing out do you

02:32:30.760 --> 02:32:32.760

02:32:32.760 --> 02:32:34.760

02:32:34.760 --> 02:32:36.760
wait wait you cannot give an FU

02:32:36.760 --> 02:32:38.760
without the music no we talked last week

02:32:38.760 --> 02:32:40.760
we noticed ever since we shifted our show roll around

02:32:40.760 --> 02:32:42.760
where FUs were supposed to be at the end we've kind of

02:32:42.760 --> 02:32:44.760
just been ending the show but

02:32:44.760 --> 02:32:46.760
we said FUs will still be done on an as needed

02:32:46.760 --> 02:32:48.760
basis so it sounds like

02:32:48.760 --> 02:32:50.760
well alright tonight it is needed Dark Sakura has asked

02:32:50.760 --> 02:32:52.760
for some FUs

02:32:54.760 --> 02:32:56.760

02:33:14.760 --> 02:33:16.760
of some kind so that I can

02:33:16.760 --> 02:33:18.760

02:33:42.760 --> 02:33:44.760
