00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:46,760

00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:52,760
live here at the Voice Geeks Network, vognetwork.com where we tape every Sunday, we tape live

00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:57,760

12
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,760
and we are here to talk about video games and gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle too

13
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,760
with me here in studio, welcome back DarkSakura, Jamie Summers

14
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,760
Why hello there

15
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,760
Hi how are you doing?

16
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,760
Better than last week

17
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,760
Yeah you don't sound so great but at least you look good

18
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,760
Well of course I look good

19
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,760
I always look good, I woke up like this

20
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,760
Girl

21
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:23,760
I gotta say also a big thank you and hugs and kisses to DarkSakura because this was

22
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:28,760
something she ran and picked up for me after the show two weeks ago when she was here because

23
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:33,760
she'd spotted them. This is like a Walmart exclusive which I don't set foot in Walmarts ever

24
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:38,760
If I could have helped it but I went and looked for him for Dan because he had been all hyper

25
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,760
We went to like three different fucking Walmarts looking for him

26
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:45,760
So what these are and if I do go to a Walmart, I go to the Walmart that they built here

27
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:50,760
We broadcast live in Sacramento, California and there is a Walmart in the middle of nowhere

28
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:55,760
Like literally in the back roads, like you're going to go to Elk Grove on the back roads for those that are local

29
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:01,760
Like there's literally a Walmart in the middle of nowhere, like I don't know who goes there but there's a Walmart there

30
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:05,760
And sure enough the Walmart in the middle of nowhere had the little arcade classic

31
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,760
You know all those little neighborhoods popped up around that area of Elk Grove

32
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:14,760
I think it's more built for the future because you know down here by, I don't want to give away where I live on the show

33
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,760
There's developments coming up nearby here too, anyway

34
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,760
So I was going to say these arcade classics, so this is pretty cool

35
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,760
So they're like little tiny cabinets, like arcade cabinets, like tiny arcade cabinets

36
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,760
I'm talking like the size of like a wallet

37
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,760
They're maybe what, eight inches high?

38
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,760
Yeah, yeah, they're not that big but they actually like they have a game inside them

39
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,760
So this one is what, this one's Qbert right?

40
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,760
Yeah, which I honestly think it might be the Colecovision version

41
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,760
It might be, they definitely look like old school computer versions

42
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,760
And then this one is Centipede actually

43
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,760
So I can actually, I can fire up the little demo

44
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,760
I don't know if you guys will be able to hear this okay, but you might be able to hear the little

45
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,760
Let's try

46
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,760
I don't know if they can hear that at all

47
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,760
But you can hear like the little background noises if I try to fire

48
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,760
Well I can hear it across the room

49
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,760
Maybe, it's very very quiet probably, sorry it doesn't come through very well

50
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,760
But yeah, and they're cute, they're like the screens on them are very tiny obviously

51
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,760
But this is something that I've seen like it seems to be a trend in the whole retro gaming thing

52
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,760
Because I guess this technology to make these little screen games is really cheap

53
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:21,760
Because I've seen now Atari flashbacks are coming on things that look like that

54
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,760
Where it's like a Game Boy micro or something, you remember that? The little micros?

55
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,760
I have a Game Boy micro

56
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,760
I know, they're a little bigger

57
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,760
Remember you used to carry it to E3 every year

58
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,760
I do, I do, but the screens are maybe a little bigger than that

59
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,760
Do you know that got me into a Nintendo thing once?

60
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,760
Did it really?

61
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,760
Yeah

62
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,760
No, I forgot about that

63
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,760
It was I think the last year that we went

64
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:44,760
Because the last year we went I had a media thing, it was the year before that

65
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,760
When I was like, someone's like, is that a Game Boy micro?

66
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,760
Yeah

67
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,760
You wanna come see this?

68
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,760
Sure

69
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,760
Hey Ashley since you weren't here last week, I don't even know if you heard this news

70
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,760
Did you hear about E3 opening up to the public?

71
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,760
Yeah, I knew about it

72
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,760
I was here when we talked about it the week before that

73
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,760
Oh that's right, last week was the follow up, sorry

74
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,760
Everything's a blur in gaming news you guys, sorry about that

75
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,760
So last week was the follow up that they hadn't sold out the tickets still

76
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:13,760
So not something you jumped on or are going to be going to

77
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,760
Good point, I'm kinda done with E3

78
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,760
Yeah

79
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,760
I mean it was fun

80
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,760
Stories like that I doubt are gonna happen anymore

81
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,760
If they do and we're wrong, awesome, we'll try to go next year

82
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,760
You know, but I just, you know, maybe

83
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,760
I'm still wanting to go to, I wanna go to a real convention

84
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,760
No

85
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,760
Since we're not having gamer X this year apparently

86
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,760
No, sad, well there's MagWest, that's probably the contender out here

87
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,760
I love MagFest though, and you know what really cracked me up?

88
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,760
I'm gonna go to DragCon

89
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,760
So I know you don't wanna talk politics on the show, but I'm just gonna mention

90
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,760
Me not wanna talk politics

91
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:52,760
But it was in the news that the guy who happens to reside in the White House right now

92
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,760
Was speaking at an event, right, did this whole speech thing

93
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:00,760
And the whole thing with that, that thing, he was in National Harbor, Maryland

94
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,760
He was at the exact same hotel where MagFest is at, that whole thing

95
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,760
Was at the same hotel where MagFest is at

96
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:10,760
So it kinda cracked me up knowing that, you know, the president saying whatever he's saying

97
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,760
I wasn't listening, on that stage, and I'm like

98
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,760
Gosh, that's where like, all these bands were playing

99
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,760
Like Bit Brigade was playing like just four weeks ago

100
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,760
I have to say something to Bob Coffee

101
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,760
Yeah

102
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,760
I'm not going to Anime Expo ever again

103
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,760
You've been before

104
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,760
I used to go, I went like five years in a row and cosplayed every time

105
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,760
My first AX was amazing

106
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:38,760
And then I went to the one at Disneyland Hotel where we had the DDR third mix

107
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,760
I was gonna say, you got hooked into DDR thanks to Anime Expo, right?

108
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,760
I played DDR and Combat Boots in 1999

109
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:50,760
It just got to be way too overly commercialized

110
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,760
I mean, Anime now is super commercialized anyway

111
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,760
But it wasn't quite the same thing where you'd go and you'd find

112
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,760
Like the people selling the Japanese laser discs or, you know

113
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,760
All of the, you know, real import stuff

114
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:06,760
Or the Avextrax CDs because I loaded up on Avextrax CDs

115
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,760
And it's just not what it was

116
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,760
And I broke a wing my last year at AX

117
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,760
Because that was my Angel Sanctuary cosplay

118
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,760
So, I'm kinda done

119
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,760
Fanime is a little bit better

120
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,760
But I haven't been to Fanime in a while

121
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,760
When was the last convention you went to?

122
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,760
GameRx

123
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,760
Oh yeah, GameRx, of course

124
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,760
You haven't gone to a lot though

125
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,760
No, not really

126
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,760
I hadn't even cosplayed this year because I was so mad at the cosplay contest

127
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:37,760
But I'm hoping I can make it to the convention I've been working on

128
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,760
All of their material for since it just started DerpyCon

129
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,760
One of these days I'd like to actually visit the convention I've been doing the guidebook for every year

130
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,760
That's New Jersey?

131
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,760
Yeah

132
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,760
I think Rama would love to have you out there

133
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,760
I'd like to

134
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,760
Shoot, I just want to go to New York really

135
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,760
Send me to New York somebody

136
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,760
All of y'all on the East Coast

137
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,760
Maybe get 50 bucks a person and y'all can fly me out

138
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,760
Start your GoFundMe

139
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,760
This is my Kickstarter

140
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,760
Alright, anyway

141
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,760
Bask in my presence

142
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,760
I hate to ignore

143
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,760
We had to catch up with Jamie though since she was out last week

144
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,760
But I hate to ignore her over there of course here in studio as always

145
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,760
Techmaster Loki

146
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,760
Hello

147
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,760
Hi Loki, how are you?

148
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,760
Fine

149
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,760
What do you think of these little arcade thingies?

150
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,760
Are these, is this the sort of thing that interests you or are you like, nah it's cheap?

151
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,760
I'd buy one and take one apart

152
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,760
That's a very Loki way of putting things

153
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,760
Actually, well and that was the other thing I didn't mention about these things

154
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,760
These things were only 20 bucks a pop

155
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,760
That's the thing, that technology is like so cheap now

156
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,760
Those Atari flashbacks are what, like 40, 50 bucks?

157
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,760
I don't know, they're not that expensive

158
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,760
And I see these all the time now

159
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,760
I was at the mall yesterday

160
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:46,760
There's a, what's that new store that's popping up with all the nerdy stuff

161
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,760
BoxLunch, is that what it's called?

162
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,760
Hot Topic?

163
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,760
No, well I think it's the same people that run them

164
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,760
Spencer's?

165
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,760
No, I think it's BoxLunch is what it's called

166
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,760
Spencer's is disgusting now

167
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,760
I don't even think they have that at our mall

168
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,760
Yeah, they have it at Sunrise still

169
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,760
No, there's Spencer's at Sunrise

170
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,760
Who goes there? Anyway

171
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,760
Disgusting people

172
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,760
Apparently I do

173
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,760
But what was I going to say about that whole thing?

174
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,760
Oh, so I was at the BoxLunch

175
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,760
Which sells, they have little sections dedicated to all the nerdom things, right?

176
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,760
There's a little Doctor Who section, there's a little Pokemon section

177
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:21,760
That's right, they do have one of those places down at the Paladio

178
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,760
They have a BoxLunch there

179
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,760
Oh, do they really? Okay, okay

180
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,760
Or something that is very similar to that

181
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,760
So of course I got a look in the gamer section

182
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,760
Because they have like gamer shirts

183
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,760
And there was of course a lot of Overwatch stuff

184
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,760
But I was like, oh maybe I want a D.Va shirt

185
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,760
And there was a Soldier 76 shirt I took a picture of and sent to Shane

186
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,760
Because he had gray hair at the time because he's in the process of dying it

187
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,760
But they also had, in their whole little gaming section

188
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:49,760
They had a little like mini, like 100 retro game thing

189
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,760
That was like one of these tiny screens

190
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,760
That was like probably something you'd put on a keychain

191
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,760
That had 100 retro games on it

192
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,760
Except they're all just like, I know they're garbage

193
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,760
Not things you recognize

194
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,760
Like this game looks like Pole Position

195
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,760
But it's not

196
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,760
And you know, they're not

197
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,760
It's Pole Poopsition

198
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,760
Exactly, it's Pole Poopsition

199
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,760
And 99 other games

200
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,760
It's like those old Nintendo carts that are like 250 games in one

201
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,760
Then the joke is, all the games suck

202
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,760
It's like one of those things

203
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,760
But anyway, I saw one of those

204
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,760
And I was like, those were pretty cheap too

205
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,760
So this is like this trend now in retro gaming

206
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,760
Is that the technology is so cheap for these tiny screens

207
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,760
We're probably gonna see even more of it in the coming years

208
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,760
I don't know

209
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,760
I wanna also of course introduce our chatroom over at live.vog.network.com

210
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,760
Again, live on Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific

211
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,760
We read your chat comments

212
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,760
And you can participate along with the show

213
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,760
And sometimes you guys drive what we talk about here on air

214
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,760
I know there's other stuff going on in the entertainment world this evening

215
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,760
But I mean, isn't it pretty clear what's gonna win Best Picture?

216
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,760
No, there's not

217
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,760
About 14 nominees, anyway

218
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,760
So thank you guys for being here even when there's other stuff going on

219
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,760
But Darth Tetsuya is talking about the flashback portable

220
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,760
Kind of looked almost like a PSP or something

221
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,760
But a bunch of Atari classics on it

222
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,760
I think it also supported SD card ROMs

223
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:22,760
I didn't even realize that if that's the case, that's pretty rad

224
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,760
If you can actually load ROMs on it too

225
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,760
And how big of an SD card do you need for Atari 2600 ROMs?

226
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,760
Last I checked, I mean this was a while back when I downloaded the full ROM

227
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,760
So it was like 6 megs, so it can't be that large

228
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,760
Atari ROMs are like 4 kilobytes

229
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,760
That's what made the programming on that system and the things that they did so fucking impressive

230
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,760
Is that they had no space to work with

231
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,760
With Atari 2600 games

232
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,760
So it's really amazing the stuff that they crammed

233
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:55,760
I mean, as much of a garbage translation as Pac-Man is versus the arcade

234
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,760
The whole reason why the Pac-Man turned out garbage

235
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:04,760
Is because Atari wanted it on a 4k ROM cartridge

236
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,760
As opposed to a more expensive 8k cartridge

237
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,760
Which I think when they did Ms. Pac-Man on Atari 2600

238
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,760
Like a couple years later before the big bust and everything

239
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,760
If you ever played Ms. Pac-Man on Atari 2600

240
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,760
It's fine, it's not exactly like the arcade

241
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,760
But it's much more what you would expect an arcade translation to look like on the 2600

242
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,760
But the 4k only ROM on Pac-Man, that's what killed that game

243
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,760
Is that the guy was so limited on what he could work with

244
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,760
It's like, he could only have it

245
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,760
The reason why the ghosts flicker

246
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:40,760
Is because it could only draw one ghost each frame

247
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,760
It couldn't draw four ghosts

248
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,760
So it draws this ghost, then this ghost

249
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,760
That's okay, it's transparency right?

250
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,760
That's why I always thought it was

251
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,760
It's flickering because they're transparent

252
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,760
Stop Ian Chat says it does support SD cart ROMs

253
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,760
But it's not 100% compatible

254
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,760
Well that's kind of, I didn't even know that

255
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,760
Like I'm learning something here on Tonight's OLR

256
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,760
I had no idea, because that means I could play that homebrew shit

257
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,760
Like Halo for the 2600

258
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,760
Or didn't some guy go in and fix ET?

259
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,760
Yeah they fixed ET

260
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,760
That was the thing we reported on

261
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,760
So you could play Stacks

262
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,760
That game that was part of the Ready Player One contest

263
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,760
Yes, yes

264
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,760
Yes, I don't know why that's so fucking rad

265
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,760
But it is, I don't know

266
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,760
Anyway, let's see

267
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,760
Dark Tetsuya says there's a homebrew version of Pac-Man that's way badder

268
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,760
It was based on the Ms. Pac-Man conversion

269
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,760
Yes, if you've ever played that, it's great

270
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,760
Did he just remove the bow and that's it?

271
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,760
I guess and change the pink to blue or whatever

272
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,760
He had to do to change, yeah probably

273
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,760
Oh thank you, Bobby Blackpool says there was only three ghosts in the Atari 2600 version

274
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,760
I forgot that

275
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,760
I forgot that there was even, they had to downplay the three ghosts

276
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,760
It's hard enough even on that

277
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,760
I know, I know, jeez

278
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,760
I still, I still, even though it was garbage

279
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,760
The thing is, when you're six years old

280
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,760
Which I think is how old I was when I was playing Pac-Man on the 2600

281
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,760
You don't give a fuck

282
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,760
Like you, you just don't, I don't know

283
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:04,760
Does your six year old care about graphics and accuracy of things?

284
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,760
Yes

285
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,760
Maybe the 80's was just a simpler time

286
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,760
Well they, they will just, but see now they're so

287
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,760
Like they know what Minecraft is

288
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,760
They don't know anything 8 bit or 16 bit

289
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,760
They're like, look daddy, Minecraft

290
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,760
I'm like no, that's just how games look

291
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,760
I'm like, you better be good, I'm gonna make you play the Colecovision over here

292
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,760
Let's see how, you think that's terrible

293
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,760
Well, hold on

294
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,760
Darsakra, how do you view Colecovision gaming as punishment?

295
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,760
I don't

296
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,760
Exactly, but that's the point

297
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,760
Is they play it because they're forced to play it

298
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,760
And then they, they learn to appreciate it

299
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,760
But they won't because

300
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,760
The Colecovision was the best system of its time, seriously

301
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,760
Do you know how many gamer parents I've heard say

302
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,760
I'm gonna raise my kids the right way

303
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,760
And for the first three months that they're gaming

304
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,760
They're not allowed to play anything but Atari 2600 and Colecovision

305
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,760
That's too late, he already has a tablet

306
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,760
Like for example

307
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,760
In the next three months they do Nintendo

308
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,760
Let me just put it this way, okay

309
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,760
Today, alone, today, he must have watched and played

310
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,760
He got up at six o'clock this morning

311
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:15,760
And watched four hours of Minecraft YouTube videos

312
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,760
He then played another couple hours of Minecraft on the Wii U

313
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:26,760
Followed by probably what was like another three hours of Minecraft YouTube videos

314
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,760
That's too much Minecraft

315
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,760
Exactly, he doesn't shut the fuck up about Minecraft

316
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,760
All the goddamn time, like dude

317
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,760
I know you like Minecraft

318
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,760
I like Minecraft somewhat

319
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,760
But I don't need to hear Minecraft every fucking second of the game

320
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:46,760
Just like Daddy, Daddy was the only one that would talk about Minecraft here on OLR for a long time

321
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:53,760
But I didn't like fill every moment with Minecraft talk

322
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,760
Dark Tetsuya wants to point out about that Pac-Man ROM hack thing

323
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,760
They did redo the mazes

324
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,760
Let's not forget the maze was different in Pac-Man versus Ms. Pac-Man

325
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:06,760
Ms. Pac-Man had, I don't know if this came over on the 2600 conversion, it's been too long

326
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,760
But I remember the arcade was like four different mazes

327
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,760
As you upgraded through the fruit, you got different mazes

328
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,760
That was the future, Loki, was different mazes

329
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,760
Anyway, let's see

330
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:21,760
Stoppy in chat pointing out the Coleco Chameleon was punishment

331
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,760
Not the Coleco vision

332
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,760
That's called a scam, I'm sorry

333
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,760
Close, but not quite

334
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,760
SSU100Matt in chat at live.vognetware.com says

335
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:34,760
Forget going to your room without dessert, play Virtual Boy

336
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,760
Do you want your kid to develop chronic migraines?

337
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,760
Cause the Virtual Boy, that's how you're gonna do it

338
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,760
That is how you're gonna do it

339
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,760
You know it's quite fast, like I watched the Ben Heck tear down of the Virtual Boy

340
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,760
He actually made it better too

341
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,760
But like just learning how that worked, how the whole Virtual Boy thing worked

342
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,760
Was like a spinning mirror and they had just like lights

343
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,760
It literally was like one set of lights blinking on and off

344
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,760
And it just spinning to cover the whole screen

345
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,760
Oh, I always thought it was just one big screen

346
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,760
No, no, it's like lights bouncing off mirrors and shit

347
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,760
It's like, it's crazy

348
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,760
God, no wonder it gave people headaches, that sounds cheap

349
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,760
Alright, anyhow, let's get into tonight's kickoff topic

350
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,760
I wanna talk about a couple things here at the top of the show

351
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,760
Before we get into the rest of the gaming news

352
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,760
But the big thing this week

353
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,760
You know, OLR, we've been around 15 years

354
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,760
When the show first started

355
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,760
We were gaming on mostly the PlayStation 2

356
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,760
And I think the Xbox had just come out

357
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:33,760
I think we were finally getting Xboxes to play

358
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,760
Dance Dance Revolution Ultra Mix on Xbox

359
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,760
Like that was like back when the show started

360
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,760
When did Ultra Mix come out? Was that like, that wasn't too early in the Xbox

361
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,760
It wasn't too early, I remember when it came out

362
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,760
Because we had that guy that we used to play DDR with

363
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,760
Bring the Xbox over during OLR

364
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,760
That was when you and I lived together at the apartment we had with the pink carpet

365
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:57,760
Where we had the old webcam that would refresh every 30 seconds

366
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,760
That was when we played Ultra Mix for the first time

367
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,760
That was about the third year of the show probably

368
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,760
So maybe like 2003, 2004

369
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,760
So yeah, that was when that was out, Ultra Mix

370
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,760
But when the show first started it was mainly PlayStation 2

371
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:15,760
My point is, so we were here when PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 launched

372
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,760
We were here on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One launched

373
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:22,760
And this week, something that doesn't happen all the time is happening

374
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,760
We have a new console coming out

375
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:28,760
The Nintendo Switch is finally going to be out this Friday

376
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:34,760
So we will be living in a world where Nintendo NX is no longer something we speculate about

377
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,760
Over and over again because Nintendo won't say a goddamn thing about it

378
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,760
But we finally will be playing the Switch

379
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,760
And now that the press is getting their hands on the Switch

380
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,760
And more and more people are coming across

381
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,760
Nintendo Switch is out at expo events

382
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,760
I know Nintendo is in San Francisco with their tour

383
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:58,760
Which, with all respect, I didn't see the point of going to the San Francisco thing when it's out in like six days

384
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,760
I'm like, I'll have it in my living room in six days

385
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,760
So Nintendo Switch is going to be out

386
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,760
And we're finally learning the last few things about the console

387
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,760
Some of our questions getting answered

388
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,760
One of the big whoppers that they dropped on us this week

389
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,760
Virtual console ain't going to be there

390
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,760
No shit, you don't say

391
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:20,760
Well, now, again, not to inflate my ego too much

392
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,760
I need to be able to fit through the door

393
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,760
But did I not say on last week's show

394
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,760
We need to be prepared, it's not coming

395
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,760
Because they're not talking about it, it's not going to be here

396
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,760
Did I not say that like on last week's show

397
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:34,760
So, it doesn't mean I wasn't still disappointed in the news

398
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,760
And I gotta say

399
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,760
I really had to kind of like

400
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,760
I don't want to say argue about this

401
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,760
Because arguing over video games is sometimes silly

402
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,760
But I've had to have debates with this

403
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,760
Where I know so many people

404
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,760
That are huge Nintendo fans

405
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,760
Where it's like

406
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,760
If you criticize Nintendo

407
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,760
It's like you attack their religion or something

408
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,760
And it's like, okay, look

409
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,760
I can love video games, I do love video games

410
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,760
And I can love Nintendo, I do love Nintendo

411
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,760
I can still be critical of Nintendo

412
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,760
Question the things you love

413
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,760
Exactly, you can still sit here and go

414
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,760
This is something that should be better

415
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,760
And I do it with all the systems

416
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,760
Sony is not perfect

417
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,760
Microsoft is not perfect

418
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,760
Yes, she doesn't have an Xbox One

419
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,760
You know, Microsoft

420
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,760
And there's things I love about Microsoft

421
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,760
I think the Windows 10 integration is awesome

422
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,760
Personally, but anyway

423
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,760
I think Windows 10 is poop

424
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,760
It is awesome because now I don't have to buy an Xbox One

425
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,760
This isn't about Microsoft

426
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,760
Look, this is about Nintendo

427
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,760
And I think even though I can say I love Nintendo

428
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,760
I do feel like I get disappointed

429
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,760
By Nintendo a lot

430
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,760
Because you feel like there's these things that are like

431
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,760
The low hanging fruit

432
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,760
That's what they call it in the corporate world

433
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,760
The low hanging fruit that you think Nintendo could go for

434
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,760
And they don't

435
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,760
And this has been a battle for forever

436
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,760
It's been the whole online gaming thing

437
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,760
It's been like a low hanging fruit for Nintendo

438
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,760
That they never seem to get

439
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,760
That maybe they're going to get right with the Switch

440
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,760
Now they're going to charge money for it

441
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,760
But we don't know because Nintendo's really

442
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,760
Still not answering a lot of those questions

443
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,760
Although

444
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,760
What? Are we going to find out on Friday?

445
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,760
I guess we're going to have to with the online stuff

446
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,760
Right? Because Bomberman and all that stuff is supposed to be playable online

447
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,760
So we'll start to get some of those answers finally by Friday

448
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,760
But anyway

449
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,760
Virtual Console ain't going to be there day one

450
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,760
And I have to admit I'm a little bit disappointed

451
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,760
And you know

452
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,760
Some folks are trying to needle me on Twitter a little bit

453
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,760
Saying, oh Rob

454
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,760
Do you really have to play Balloon Fight on a

455
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,760
30 year old game on a brand new Nintendo console

456
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,760
And it's like

457
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,760
Well, yes

458
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,760
Actually

459
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,760
Because something that the Switch can do

460
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,760
That the other systems that

461
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,760
Virtual Console isn't available on

462
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,760
Is the whole fact that I could be playing

463
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,760
Something on my TV and then

464
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,760
Pick up my Switch and go somewhere else with it

465
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,760
And I was looking forward to being able to do that with

466
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,760
Yes, the old games too

467
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,760
Or the whole fact that

468
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,760
Perhaps if we're playing a two player game

469
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,760
Like the original Mario Brothers

470
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,760
Not Super Mario Brothers, the original Mario Brothers

471
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,760
Maybe I could have a Switch

472
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,760
And my friend who's over has a Switch

473
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,760
And we can play old school console

474
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,760
Games like that, you know

475
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,760
Like in the same room and be having fun with that

476
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,760
Right? So, yeah

477
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,760
I am a little disappointed that's not going to be there day one

478
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,760
I understand that Virtual Console will probably

479
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,760
Happen eventually

480
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,760
But it's another one of those things

481
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,760
Where I'm like, this launch

482
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,760
Is starting to feel more and more

483
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,760
Half-assed

484
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,760
And then I had one of my friends

485
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,760
Telling me about how, well when you look

486
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,760
At the other console launches

487
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,760
You know, how can you say that Nintendo is half-assed

488
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,760
Because PlayStation 4 had

489
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,760
All these ports when it came out and dah dah dah

490
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,760
And all this other stuff

491
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,760
Here's the thing

492
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,760
I was thinking about that

493
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,760
And this is one of the other key differences

494
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,760
The reason why I'm really feeling

495
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,760
This a lot is of how

496
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,760
Shady

497
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,760
Nintendo is being with the information

498
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,760
At least with PlayStation 4

499
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,760
At least with Xbox

500
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,760
And these other systems

501
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,760
We pretty much knew months in advance

502
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,760
Exactly what was going to come out of that box

503
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,760
We learned the answer about Virtual Console

504
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,760
This week

505
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,760
We still don't know the answers about online

506
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,760
And this is out in five days

507
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,760
Right? That's the shit that is starting

508
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,760
To make this really feel like

509
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,760
We're pulling it out of our asses as we go

510
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,760
We don't have any sort of like

511
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,760
And even the PlayStation 3 or even

512
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,760
Xbox 360, Xbox One

513
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,760
There was no question of how online

514
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,760
Was going to work for those systems

515
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,760
Or even that most of the feature sets

516
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,760
Advertised for it are going to be there at launch

517
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,760
Not, oh hey

518
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,760
Patch it in later

519
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,760
Dartitsuyu in chat says

520
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,760
But to be fair, is Virtual Console really

521
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,760
A huge deal? In the meantime, they're going to get

522
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,760
Arcade Archives, so if you need your retro fix

523
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,760
That would be the way to go

524
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,760
Arcade Archives is cool, but have they said

525
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,760
Witch games in the archives, there's

526
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,760
Kind of a lot of garbage in the Arcade Archives

527
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,760
There's some good stuff, there's some good Neo Geo

528
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,760
Fighters and like Bubble Bobble

529
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,760
Isn't that just Virtual Console anyways?

530
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,760
It's Sony's thing, it's like arcade emulation

531
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,760
Basically, and yeah, it's

532
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,760
It is kind of just Virtual Console, so it is weird

533
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,760
To me that it's, the Arcade Archives

534
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,760
Thing is getting a whole spinoff, but

535
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,760
Whatever, it doesn't make sense

536
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,760
It's probably because

537
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,760
Their networking shit ain't worked out

538
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,760
Because if you think about it

539
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,760
That isn't

540
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,760
I mean, I guess it does make sense that Virtual Console

541
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,760
Is not there, because they're saying that Virtual Console now

542
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,760
Is going to support net play over

543
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,760
You know, over the internet

544
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,760
As you're going to be able to do multiplayer

545
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,760
So because they don't have their net code shit figured out

546
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,760
That's why you don't have the networking

547
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,760
The online networking right now, or multiplayer

548
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,760
For the most part

549
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,760
I mean, at least that paid service

550
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,760
And maybe that's why Virtual Console's not out

551
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,760
Whereas these arcade games don't have

552
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,760
That, or at least I assume they don't have

553
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,760
That internet play

554
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,760
And so that's why they're able to just dump them on there

555
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,760
So anyway, um

556
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,760
Let's see, what's the other thing here

557
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,760
Sj100matt in chat says

558
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,760
I would like a Virtual Console lineup to supplement the inevitable

559
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,760
Dead period between games on the Switch

560
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,760
Yeah, that's true too

561
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,760
And to be fair, maybe there was a part of me

562
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,760
That was hoping that Nintendo was

563
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,760
Going to do it differently this time

564
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,760
With Virtual Console, I know, hahaha

565
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,760
But that they would actually have a

566
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,760
Constant flow of Virtual Console

567
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,760
Releases, which if you look at the Wii U

568
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,760
In the past couple years, it has not been a constant flow

569
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,760
But, you know, God

570
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,760
There's this story floating around the internet

571
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,760
About a guy who just beat

572
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,760
714 Nintendo

573
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,760
Games on his Twitch stream, right?

574
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,760
There's a big story going around about that this week, right?

575
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,760
So there's over

576
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,760
700 Nintendo games

577
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,760
That they could put on Virtual Console

578
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,760
You put one game a week

579
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,760
And that's just Nintendo

580
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,760
You put one game a week

581
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,760
And that would carry that system for over

582
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,760
10 years

583
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,760
Like with new stuff

584
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,760
Ok, I understand, some of those games are garbage

585
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,760
Licensing issues

586
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,760
Blah de blah de blah, fine

587
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,760
Get like 200 of the 700 games

588
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,760
Less than a third

589
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,760
Get 200 of them

590
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,760
That's still going to be like one new game a week

591
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,760
For almost 4 years

592
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,760
And that's just Nintendo

593
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,760
That's not even counting

594
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,760
Super Nintendo, Genesis, Turbo Graphics

595
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,760
Commodore 64 they could bring back

596
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,760
Because that's the soft spot in my heart

597
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,760
They did like 4 Commodore 64 games on the Wii

598
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,760
And then that was it

599
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,760
Yeah, I guess I'm just a little bummed

600
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,760
I was just hoping

601
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,760
Maybe Virtual Console would be a little better

602
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,760
This time

603
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,760
Doesn't sound like it's going to be

604
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,760
So it's a little bit disappointing in my opinion

605
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,760
But

606
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,760
I will give Nintendo this credit

607
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,760
Because, oh my gosh, I can be critical

608
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,760
And I can say good things too

609
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,760
And I am very excited to hear

610
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,760
That it sounds like more games are actually

611
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,760
Making the launch day, right?

612
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,760
Yeah, more games are making the launch day

613
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,760
And also with that

614
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,760
They're physical games, you know

615
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,760
If you're like, of course, buying digitally

616
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,760
You're going to have to install everything

617
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,760
But they're physical games, unlike the PlayStation 4

618
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,760
And Xbox One

619
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,760
Do not require an install on top of

620
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,760
The game

621
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,760
It's just going to be whatever's on that

622
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,760
That cartridge

623
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,760
That's going to be cool

624
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,760
At least right now

625
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,760
Can't promise that for the future

626
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,760
Yeah, that's still cool

627
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,760
That more games are going to make the actual launch day

628
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,760
I know I'm very excited for Fast Racing

629
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,760
Neo Remix

630
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,760
Thought that was a very competent game on the Wii U

631
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,760
So I'm excited to see what they do with that

632
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,760
With the Switch

633
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,760
Now that's another game I will have to get on March 3

634
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,760
Because right now, as it was

635
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,760
I was really only going to get Zelda

636
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,760
I'm not really interested in the Bomberman

637
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,760
Thing, which I've talked about before

638
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,760
Maybe when I see it in action, I'll change my mind

639
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,760
But I'm not willing to

640
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,760
Take the leap of faith on Bomberman

641
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,760
The way I'm willing to do with Zelda

642
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,760
But I know Fast Racing Neo, I'm willing to take the leap of faith with that

643
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,760
So I'm excited to get that

644
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,760
And what, Snipperclips

645
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,760
Or whatever they're calling that, that's out

646
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,760
On March 3rd as well

647
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,760
Nippleclamps, that's out on March 3rd as well

648
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,760
You can use your Joy-Con

649
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,760
And explore fun new ways with your friends

650
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,760
To titillate

651
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,760
With HD vibrations

652
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,760
But yeah, Snipperclips

653
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,760
I'm sure will be fun

654
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,760
And that might be a good in the same room type of game too

655
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,760
So I mean, yes, there's positive things as well

656
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,760
I like that

657
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,760
Okay, now Nintendo's coming out swinging out the door

658
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,760
With more than just Zelda

659
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,760
Even though, you know, of course, Zelda's a big freaking deal

660
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,760
But that'll be nice

661
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,760
So, I'm still getting my Switch

662
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,760
I can huff and puff about Virtual Console

663
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,760
I think I'm just

664
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,760
Accepting that

665
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,760
The Switch for right now

666
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,760
Is going to be a Zelda machine

667
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,760
For the first couple months

668
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,760
And Nintendo should really be thanking BioWare

669
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,760
For going to be distracting me

670
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,760
With Mass Effect Andromeda

671
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,760
In these first few months

672
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,760
Right after, you know, I get some good hands on time with Zelda

673
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,760
And then by the time I'm done with Mass Effect Andromeda

674
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,760
Oh, here comes Mario Kart

675
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,760
Splatoon 2

676
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,760
And everything else that, you know, we have to look forward to

677
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,760
Do you have all your amiibo pre-ordered?

678
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,760
Because you gotta get all the amiibo stuff

679
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,760
Nintendo seems to think so

680
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,760
So, yeah

681
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,760
So, I mean, at least

682
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,760
There's that and, you know, by the summer

683
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,760
We get Splatoon 2, which is a big deal

684
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,760
Arms, I'm hearing a lot of

685
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,760
Positive stuff on, I'm still skeptical

686
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,760
But I'm willing to say, okay, well

687
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,760
Let me get it in my arms and play with it

688
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,760
And maybe I'll be sold on it

689
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,760
I'm excited to check it out

690
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,760
And then Holiday will be

691
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,760
The Mario game, I know, Loki

692
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,760
You like to joke that it'll get delayed

693
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,760
I think we all know Nintendo can't afford to delay that

694
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,760
They'll have that on Holiday

695
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,760
Or they'll have some big fucking title for Holiday

696
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,760
They have to, because the real launch

697
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,760
Of the Switch is Holiday

698
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,760
I fully expect Virtual Consoles in place

699
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,760
Probably in October

700
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,760
Star Fox Zero, again

701
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,760
No, they're not that bold

702
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,760
I hope not, anyway

703
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,760
Let's see, JD is in our chat over at

704
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,760
Live.vognetwork.com saying

705
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,760
A couple people I know who went to the demo

706
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,760
The San Francisco thing this weekend

707
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,760
I wasn't sold on Arms until I

708
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,760
Played it. William

709
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,760
Murderface points out Stormblood

710
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,760
Will be a nice time sink as well, that's right

711
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,760
Final Fantasy XIV gets an expansion

712
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,760
Nintendo can thank Square Enix as well

713
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,760
For that, so there'll be things to distract

714
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,760
Me from, you know, okay

715
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,760
I'm done with Zelda on the Switch, now what?

716
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,760
So, alright

717
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,760
Anyway, what else on the Switch?

718
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,760
Anything else we need to talk about with the Switch before

719
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,760
We move on into gaming weeks and

720
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,760
What else is going on? Just most of the downloads are

721
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,760
Pretty reasonably sized, it looks like anything that's

722
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,760
More of just like a digital only titles

723
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,760
Is they're gonna be about 1 gig

724
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,760
Ish, whereas

725
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,760
You know, comparable

726
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,760
Download sizes to the Wii U

727
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,760
Cause I was looking at, they had Mario Kart 8 listed

728
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,760
On there, and it's about the same size as

729
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,760
On the Wii U, which makes sense cause

730
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,760
The visuals are pretty much the same

731
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,760
And then, you know, Zelda of course

732
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,760
Being the biggest one, like 13.6

733
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,760
Gigs or something

734
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,760
Which is like half your storage right there

735
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,760
Yeah, because even though they say 32 gigs

736
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,760
The operating system

737
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,760
Takes up so much of it, and there's gonna be a

738
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,760
Day one patch by the way, so

739
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,760
Expect that more of it will get eaten up

740
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,760
Just don't buy digitally, at least on this system

741
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,760
Cause it doesn't really make sense as far as

742
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,760
Being able to store it on there right now

743
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,760
And because Nintendo's so good

744
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,760
At not dropping prices of their games

745
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,760
So that means your game's gonna be worthwhile

746
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,760
Later on, and once you've finally played out

747
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,760
Zelda to your heart's content

748
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,760
Then you can always sell it back later on

749
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,760
Like Fast Racing Neo, is that getting a physical release?

750
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,760
No, that's not, but like I'm talking about the ones you do have a choice

751
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,760
You know, just buy it at retail

752
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,760
Is I Am Setsuna still a March 3rd game?

753
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,760
I think so

754
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,760
I haven't checked that out on the other platforms yet

755
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,760
So I was thinking about maybe getting that one too on the Switch

756
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,760
Just to buff up the library a little bit

757
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,760
So, yeah, okay

758
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,760
Well, I'm gonna definitely pick up a Switch on Friday

759
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,760
And I can't wait to talk all about it on the next edition of the show

760
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,760
I'm hoping over the weekend, at some point

761
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,760
I can connect with some other people that own a Switch

762
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,760
And we can test out some of the multiplayer stuff

763
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,760
And, you know, get a feel for it

764
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,760
You know, I'm still excited, despite these things

765
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,760
Where I'm like, I have to constantly lower expectations sometimes

766
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,760
I am still excited

767
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,760
I'm excited because everything I'm hearing

768
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:07,760
About the whole fact that, you know, you play on the TV

769
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,760
And then you pick it up and take it with you

770
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,760
It's super seamless, it's fast

771
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,760
It works the way you think it would based on the previews

772
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,760
I think a lot of that sounds really exciting

773
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:20,760
It sounds like, if nothing else, as a tech nerd

774
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,760
The technology's gonna be awesome

775
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,760
Even if sometimes I wish Nintendo would do a little more with the technology

776
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,760
That's all it is

777
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,760
So, yeah, and DungeonBuster in chat over at live.vognetwork.com

778
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,760
Says, it's been getting good reviews so far

779
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,760
And ActDeft confirming, iAmSatsuna is March 3rd, yeah

780
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:38,760
JD pointing out, aren't SD cards cheap and easy to upgrade on consoles?

781
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,760
Yeah, there is that

782
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,760
So, I mean, even though Loki's saying, don't go digital

783
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,760
I still understand, I understand what you're saying when it comes to like that

784
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,760
But does it have expanded storage on that console?

785
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:49,760
Oh, yeah, you can pop in another SD card, that's it

786
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,760
Are they gonna allow you to save to it?

787
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,760
Yes, yes, no, that's not a problem

788
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:59,760
They are making that a lot easier than it was on their other systems

789
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,760
So that part's, well, even on the Wii, it really wasn't that bad

790
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,760
But I think it's even gonna be a little better on the Switch

791
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,760
I'm not worried about that end of it at all

792
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,760
But I think you do raise a damn good point

793
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:16,760
When, and I've always said this, you know, what's the benefit in me buying digital, right?

794
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:20,760
Because you said Nintendo doesn't drop the price on their games for a long time

795
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,760
So you have more

796
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,760
Or at all, I mean

797
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,760
You have more equity basically in those cartridges

798
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,760
Those cartridges are still worth something

799
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,760
So if you do get sick of the game, you can sell it back

800
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,760
And you make some money back

801
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,760
Whereas with digital games, you don't ever get to do that

802
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,760
Yeah, like, I mean, I'm not saying that Zelda isn't necessarily a great example

803
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,760
Because Zelda's gonna be probably, I mean, that Zelda

804
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,760
I think it's gonna be one that's gonna have a lot of replayability on it

805
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,760
But like something like ARMS or something

806
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,760
Where you may buy it and it may be fun for a while

807
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,760
And it's just like, okay, listen, I'm just not really interested in playing this anymore

808
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:52,760
That might be something that's worth picking up physically and doing that

809
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,760
I mean, I'm definitely looking forward to picking up Zelda

810
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,760
Just to be picking it up on the Wii U

811
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,760
I haven't pre-ordered it, so I'll try to go pick it up day one

812
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:05,760
And if they say, oh, it's not available, like, well, fine, I'll just download it

813
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,760
I'm not pre-ordering your shit fucking GameStop

814
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:12,760
Let's see, a couple of people in chat talking about the whole memory card thing

815
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:17,760
And a couple of people saying it looks like two terabytes may be the cap on the memory cards

816
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,760
And what the Switch supports, but, okay, two terabytes

817
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,760
Let's not get ahead of ourselves, I mean, there's not that many games coming out for you

818
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,760
I mean, shit

819
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,760
You could probably fit

820
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,760
That's a little much

821
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,760
You could probably fit everything that Nintendo's gonna release this year on that kind of card

822
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,760
Or in the lifetime of the system

823
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,760
But that is low-key

824
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:39,760
That is good, though, that, you know, yes, it will go that high if people do want to do the digital thing

825
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,760
Because there are people that disagree

826
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,760
And they think that the digital thing is much more of a convenience

827
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,760
Especially those that are gonna be more portable with the system

828
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,760
Fine, more power to you

829
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:52,760
They are really missing out, though, not having YouTube or Netflix or anything on that thing

830
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,760
I'm serious, like, that's what my son uses before we got his tablet

831
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,760
That's the way he would use it

832
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,760
And he still uses the Wii U for that, is watching YouTube

833
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:05,760
And I think Netflix on the TV to the portable instantly is a real missed opportunity

834
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,760
We talked about that in a previous episode, I'm not gonna re-hide that

835
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,760
But, you know what, maybe it'll be there by holiday

836
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:16,760
I think we need to go back and re-evaluate, I think it'll be interesting

837
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:21,760
I almost feel like I wanna, like, write down every- maybe we'll do this on the next episode of OLR

838
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,760
Tell me if you guys think this is a good idea

839
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,760
On the next episode of OLR, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna write down the list of my grievances

840
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,760
And things I wish they would do better on the Switch

841
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,760
I'm gonna write it down, and we're gonna put it in an envelope and leave it here in the studio

842
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:43,760
And during the Christmas episode of OLR, we're gonna open it and see what problems Nintendo addressed during the year to make the console a full-fledged system

843
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,760
Shortest time capsule ever

844
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,760
Yeah, shortest time capsule ever

845
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,760
I like that, that's the segment

846
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:51,760
Short attention span time capsule

847
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,760
We should just do one of those every year

848
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,760
I think it's a good idea, short attention span time

849
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:01,760
Well, shit, episodes of this show are kind of- we could just always go back and listen to an old episode of OLR

850
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,760
But that would involve us having to listen to ourselves

851
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,760
I don't wanna do that

852
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,760
No, not gonna do that

853
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,760
I certainly don't wanna listen to myself the way I sound right now

854
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,760
I don't even wanna talk the way I sound right now

855
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,760
Alright, done

856
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,760
JD in a sock

857
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:19,760
Yes, JD in chat says a mini time capsule is a great idea

858
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,760
Come on, Noel Gus in chat says put your list in a sock

859
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,760
And you know what?

860
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,760
I love it, we're gonna put it in a sock

861
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,760
No, you know, we need a time capsule, you know what that means?

862
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,760
We need to get one of those little containers of the mini Tootsie Rolls

863
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,760
That's actually also doubles as a piggy bank

864
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,760
I gave you one

865
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,760
And there you go

866
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,760
So vanilla ones

867
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,760
I wasn't thinking of the short attention span time capsule

868
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,760
And then on top of that, we get mini Tootsie Rolls

869
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,760
I support this play, okay

870
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:49,760
And we'll leave one in the time capsule as a present to ourselves

871
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,760
You know what? I should like put in like a clipping of my hair to see if my hair color is like

872
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,760
Is that gonna be like a

873
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,760
Pused by the end of the year or something

874
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,760
Okay, I love it

875
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,760
We're creating a scene in the Christmas story where we're like we're cutting it into three pieces, you know

876
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,760
This mini Tootsie

877
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,760
Alright, this is happening on the next OLR

878
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:08,760
Short attention span time capsule 2017 edition Nintendo Switch

879
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,760
I actually think I still have one of those containers somewhere

880
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,760
Alright, then bring it to the show and that can be our time capsule

881
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,760
Let's go buy another one

882
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,760
If not, then I'll just go to the dollar store

883
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,760
I will find a sock

884
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,760
Get a plastic bin

885
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,760
We'll paint it silver

886
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,760
Okay, it has to fit here in the studio somewhere

887
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,760
We have to

888
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,760
Alright, I love it

889
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,760
Come on, Noel Gush suggests

890
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:33,760
Go to the 99 cent only store and put a Lego dimensions figure in it as well

891
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,760
Dude, yeah, like I want to run across those

892
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:40,760
Like my son got one as like a Valentine's Day card or whatever

893
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,760
And of course he's like, I don't want this

894
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,760
And it was the Simpsons car

895
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,760
I was like, sweet, where do I get more of these?

896
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,760
I like building Legos

897
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,760
Like more than any person probably should

898
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,760
But I like it

899
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,760
Alright, anything else on the Switch we need to talk about before Friday?

900
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,760
No

901
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,760
Alright, there it is

902
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,760
So, Darsakha, will you at least

903
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,760
Will you try playing with my Switch before we

904
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,760
Shove things in a sock?

905
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,760
I'm going to pretend that you didn't phrase it exactly that way

906
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,760
Alright

907
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,760
I would entertain

908
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,760
Phrasing

909
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,760
I would entertain the possibility

910
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,760
Of a demo of the Nintendo Switch

911
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,760
That you just happen to own

912
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,760
Socks not included

913
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,760
Okay, fair enough

914
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,760
JD in chat simply says, whoa

915
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,760
Phrasing

916
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,760
That's Emmison Mansey

917
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,760
You know what, that's going to be our quote

918
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:39,760
Our word of the year, like Tatiana's choices

919
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,760
Phrasing

920
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,760
Phrasing

921
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,760
That Archer episode was like four years ago

922
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,760
So I kind of think

923
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,760
That's like every Archer episode

924
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,760
I've only watched like one season of Archer

925
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,760
Okay, first off

926
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,760
And What's Your Face was pregnant most of it

927
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,760
First off, Archer is fucking amazing

928
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,760
Like it's got some of the greatest quotes in it

929
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,760
Like I just said, Emmison Mansey

930
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,760
Do you like ants?

931
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,760
Do you want ants? Because that's how you get ants

932
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,760
Why not that?

933
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,760
Lots of great

934
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,760
Archer quotes, anyway

935
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,760
Let's move on

936
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,760
I was ready to move on

937
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,760
Let's move on to our

938
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,760
Too many socks

939
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,760
Alright, that's in the 2015 capsule

940
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,760
Oh god

941
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,760
How was your gaming week?

942
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,760
What types of video games have you been playing this week?

943
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,760
And what socks have you been wearing?

944
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,760
Dark Sakura

945
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,760
I have these very cushy socks that I got at Daiso

946
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,760
In Roseville

947
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,760
They're $1.25 a piece

948
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,760
And their pile, they're very comfortable

949
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,760
They're my new favorite pair of socks

950
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,760
For $1.25?

951
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,760
Yeah, seriously, fucking Daiso

952
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,760
I know what a Daiso is

953
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,760
Cat socks at Daiso, worth every penny

954
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,760
One of those vacuums?

955
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,760
That's Dyson

956
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,760
It's like a Japanese Dollar Tree

957
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,760
It's like the Dollar Tree that everything in there is like

958
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,760
In Japan it's like a Yen store

959
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,760
Where's this? The Galleria

960
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,760
They have one at the Galleria and they're putting one in South Sac

961
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,760
Which is going to be like

962
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,760
Daiso, yeah

963
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,760
Oh my god, I'm going to be so happy

964
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,760
I fucking love Daiso

965
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,760
Anyway, so now that the socks are out of the way

966
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,760
Let's go ahead and get on to my

967
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,760
game I've been playing

968
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,760
Game singular, because fuck

969
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,760
AkumaJP is pointing out it's a 100 Yen shop

970
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,760
That's what I corrected myself

971
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,760
Okay, I was going to say 1 Yen is actually not a lot of money

972
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,760
No, I corrected myself

973
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,760
It's like the Peso store

974
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,760
Did everyone not hear when I corrected myself?

975
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,760
No, we were laughing too hard at the sock thing

976
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,760
Girl, okay

977
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,760
Video games!

978
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,760
But also my Daiso socks are amazing

979
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,760
Anyway, so I've just been playing World of Warcraft

980
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,760
Like, a lot

981
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,760
Dan's probably

982
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,760
Addict

983
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,760
You know what, yeah, kinda

984
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,760
How does it feel all these years later?

985
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,760
Well, I really, though, I like this whole

986
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,760
expansion because

987
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,760
I am an Illidan fangirl

988
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,760
And it's just been

989
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,760
Demon Hunties all over the place

990
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,760
Addict

991
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,760
You should still play with me in VRT

992
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,760
Because it's fun

993
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,760
Are the gameboy.org guys ever on there?

994
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,760
John was on once

995
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,760
To give me

996
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,760
Guild adding privileges

997
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,760
Oh, cool

998
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,760
And then, I actually

999
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,760
I had bad

1000
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,760
insomnia one night and played Bust a Move

1001
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,760
on my phone, as in Puzzle Bobble

1002
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,760
And

1003
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,760
I don't know what the hell I did

1004
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,760
I was on some fucking streak

1005
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,760
And my highest

1006
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,760
score had been like 500,000

1007
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,760
for a while

1008
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,760
I hit 1,500,000

1009
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,760
And I don't even know what I did

1010
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,760
So, lots of Bust a Move

1011
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,760
And then

1012
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,760
Pokemon Go, because all the new Pokemans

1013
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,760
are out and they're adorable

1014
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,760
Except for this one thing

1015
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,760
That I wasn't even thinking of Magma being part of its name

1016
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,760
And you know how I feel about

1017
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,760
Snails and Slugs, I hate them

1018
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,760
And it was called

1019
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,760
It's Slugma

1020
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,760
Slugma, right

1021
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,760
I didn't for a moment think about Magma

1022
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,760
Do not go to the nastiest place possible on this show

1023
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,760
I did go to the nastiest place possible

1024
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,760
That's all you need to say

1025
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,760
Until someone pointed out that

1026
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,760
No, that's fire and it's magma

1027
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,760
And not the favorite curse from Red Dwarf

1028
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,760
So

1029
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,760
Yeah

1030
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,760
I caught one and I don't care anymore

1031
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,760
So

1032
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,760
Um

1033
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,760
I have a Furret now

1034
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,760
And it's adorable

1035
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,760
The Furrets are cute, considering they're the new Pidgeys

1036
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,760
And those things, the Centrets or whatever

1037
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,760
Are fucking everywhere

1038
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,760
And now I have all these Furrets

1039
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,760
The Furrets are adorable

1040
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,760
I just want to take a nap in a pile of Furrets

1041
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,760
You do want a Furret coat for Christmas?

1042
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,760
No!

1043
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,760
I want them to be alive and scribble

1044
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,760
I want them to be pets for reals

1045
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,760
But that's really been

1046
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,760
Oh yeah, Miitomo

1047
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,760
I'm still doing Miitomo

1048
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,760
I do realize though, some of the Gen 2 Pokemon

1049
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,760
Get really uncreative

1050
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,760
Like, there's a Pokemon called

1051
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,760
Pineco

1052
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,760
Do you know what it is?

1053
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,760
It's a fucking pinecone

1054
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,760
And his name is Pineco

1055
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,760
That I think is the prettiest one right now

1056
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,760
Is the Xatu

1057
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,760
Oh yeah, the evolved

1058
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,760
I caught one on its own

1059
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,760
But they're pretty

1060
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,760
Like, Mayan and Incan

1061
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,760
Design

1062
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,760
And I really like the design

1063
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,760
Some of the designs are really cool

1064
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,760
My watch told me to stand, so I'm standing

1065
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,760
Alright, you stand

1066
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,760
Catch a Pokemon with your watch

1067
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,760
I have been doing Pokemon Go with my Apple Watch

1068
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,760
And I have to talk about that a little bit

1069
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,760
Sure, go for it

1070
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,760
If you can't bust out your phone

1071
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,760
But you're going to go for a walk

1072
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,760
I don't know how this works on the Series 2

1073
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,760
It has the built-in GPS and everything

1074
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,760
But I find it really neat

1075
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,760
That when I'm doing my walk at work

1076
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,760
I just turn it on on my watch

1077
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,760
And it actually even has

1078
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,760
Kind of like how your little thing blinks

1079
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,760
You know, when there's Pokemon nearby

1080
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,760
It'll actually show me the list of them

1081
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,760
And let me pick which ones I want to catch

1082
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,760
It lets me hit the Pokestop as I'm walking around

1083
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,760
But the other thing too

1084
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,760
Is that the feedback that it gives

1085
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,760
For my walking for Pokemon

1086
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,760
Goes into my

1087
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,760
Workout ring

1088
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,760
Or close the rings challenge

1089
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,760
That's a big thing

1090
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,760
All over the place

1091
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,760
It applies to my

1092
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,760
Workout ring on my watch

1093
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,760
So

1094
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,760
I love the integration

1095
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,760
It's really fun

1096
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,760
Is that like Fitbit? Because when I play Pokemon Go

1097
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,760
I still get the credit on Fitbit

1098
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,760
I honestly think it's more accurate than Fitbit

1099
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:45,760
And I've read a lot of comparisons and things

1100
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,760
And they always are updating it with every OS

1101
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,760
I'm still on the iPhone 6 Plus

1102
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,760
And the big thing they added into that

1103
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,760
Was they put a Fitbit type thing in it

1104
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,760
So I know I'm getting crazy

1105
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,760
Same with the Success Plus

1106
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,760
Or Success, what I have

1107
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,760
But the watch will also monitor your heartbeat

1108
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,760
And so as you're walking

1109
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,760
It will put it into your whole

1110
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,760
Workout thing

1111
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,760
So every time your heart rate goes up

1112
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,760
It counts as workout time

1113
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,760
I have the weirdest question about the watch

1114
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,760
Does it work if you own two iPhones?

1115
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,760
Can it sync to both?

1116
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,760
Or no, you have to pick one

1117
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,760
You have to pick one, but you can do two watches

1118
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,760
For a phone

1119
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,760
But pairing, I mean, it takes like

1120
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,760
A minute

1121
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,760
It's only because

1122
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,760
Basically your data is stored on your phone

1123
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,760
And syncs to your watch

1124
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,760
Because the watch doesn't have that big of a capacity

1125
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,760
But I mean

1126
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,760
And if you get a series too

1127
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,760
Could you imagine swimming for your Pokemon walking?

1128
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,760
That would be pretty rad

1129
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,760
But yeah, I hadn't played a lot with it

1130
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,760
Until this past week

1131
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,760
And I was actually really

1132
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,760
Delighted by how it worked

1133
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,760
Very surprised, very delighted

1134
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,760
It just really

1135
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,760
Was uh

1136
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,760
It made it a lot more fun for me

1137
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,760
Because then I didn't have to stare at my

1138
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,760
Phone while I was going walking

1139
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,760
I could actually just leave it and go

1140
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,760
And it was really fun

1141
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,760
So it's like

1142
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,760
Having your little device

1143
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,760
What's it called?

1144
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,760
Yeah, it's like having that

1145
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,760
But more interactive

1146
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,760
And then you get the little thumps on your wrist

1147
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,760
When it finds stuff

1148
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,760
So that's cool, the whole haptic feedback

1149
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,760
So anyway, that's my mini review

1150
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,760
Of Pokemon Go on the Apple Watch

1151
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,760
Alright, there it is

1152
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,760
Moving on, Loki, how was your gaming week?

1153
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,760
I played lots of Skyrim

1154
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,760
As usual

1155
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,760
And then of course also played

1156
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,760
Until Dawn Rush of Blood

1157
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,760
Because I actually haven't played

1158
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,760
Too much of that

1159
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,760
I've been demonstrating it a lot for people

1160
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,760
But I actually went and decided to play

1161
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,760
Some of it myself

1162
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,760
And that game is still a lot of fun

1163
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,760
I really enjoy that game

1164
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,760
But it's kind of funny though

1165
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,760
Because everybody else that plays those games

1166
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,760
The first time they're jumping and everything

1167
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,760
And I'm just like fucking going to town

1168
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,760
Killing shit with my guns

1169
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,760
But I really do enjoy that game

1170
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,760
And I've also been getting lots of peer pressure

1171
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,760
To get Overwatch

1172
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,760
So I don't know if I'm going to do that though

1173
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,760
It's not really on sale too much right now

1174
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,760
It's like 17% off

1175
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,760
Or something like that on the

1176
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,760
Playstation Store

1177
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,760
But I don't know

1178
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,760
People want me to play it

1179
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,760
That's it

1180
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,760
Oh well, Pokemon Go actually

1181
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,760
I don't have the plus yet

1182
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,760
But I've been playing a little bit of Pokemon Go

1183
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,760
Mainly just enough to keep my

1184
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,760
Streaks going each day

1185
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,760
That's about it

1186
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,760
Honestly I'll turn on every once in a while

1187
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,760
Usually if I need items I'll go get that

1188
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,760
When I'm walking around midtown

1189
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,760
To catch stuff

1190
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,760
I just kind of look around to see if there's anything new

1191
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,760
I got one that looks like a cow

1192
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,760
Oh the milk tank?

1193
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,760
Or whatever it's called?

1194
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,760
Those are apparently pretty good

1195
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,760
I don't have one yet

1196
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,760
So I have one of those

1197
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,760
Yeah it's like the same shit

1198
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,760
It's like the same shit all over the place

1199
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,760
It's like okay well shit I've already got all those

1200
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,760
Like I don't want any more of that crow

1201
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,760
Witch thing

1202
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,760
There's too many of those

1203
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,760
And they don't evolve

1204
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,760
Yeah they're fucking useless

1205
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,760
They're only good to finally get

1206
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,760
The fucking dark trophy

1207
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,760
For catching dark types

1208
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,760
That's what it's good for, that's it

1209
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,760
Alright well I guess I'll do that then

1210
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,760
Yeah I don't know, just recycle it

1211
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,760
And JD points out it will evolve in Gen 4

1212
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,760
Oh okay let me just wait until 2020

1213
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,760
For that you know

1214
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,760
Save those candies

1215
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,760
Save those candies yeah

1216
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,760
Alright

1217
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,760
I have to check my demon hunter right now

1218
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,760
On Warcraft? Oh yeah cause the whole app and all that

1219
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,760
That's actually pretty nice

1220
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,760
I'll tell you what I haven't really played at all this week

1221
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,760
Ingress

1222
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,760
Because I'm finding

1223
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,760
Very little point to do that anymore

1224
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,760
I've been burned out too

1225
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,760
For me it's the fact that there's no

1226
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,760
Like the live event thing

1227
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,760
I know they're doing shards

1228
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,760
But it's not exciting for me

1229
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,760
I could give a shit about shards

1230
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,760
The shard thing is too limited I think

1231
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,760
And every time I hear shard I just think of shart

1232
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,760
It's appropriate

1233
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,760
Alright

1234
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,760
My gaming week

1235
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,760
So pretty much a lot of the same standbys

1236
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,760
I've been streaming some of it on my twitch channel

1237
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,760
Cheatplug, Rob Roberts on twitch

1238
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,760
Please please follow me if you aren't already

1239
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,760
I appreciate it, I've been really trying to grow

1240
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,760
Things over there on twitch

1241
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,760
And I've been doing more streaming

1242
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,760
A lot of the old same

1243
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,760
Standby stuff, Final Fantasy 14 and

1244
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,760
Overwatch which I'm still continuing to play this week

1245
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,760
Which by the way Loki, act deft and chat

1246
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,760
Over at live.vognetware.com

1247
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,760
It's practically screaming in caps, get Overwatch

1248
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,760
Loki, yes I know everybody wants me

1249
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,760
Everyone wants

1250
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,760
Me to get Overwatch

1251
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,760
A lot of people that I'm co-workers with

1252
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,760
They play on PC so

1253
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,760
My PC's not

1254
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,760
I don't think it's good enough to run Overwatch

1255
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,760
You might want to check

1256
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,760
Sometimes Blizzard's pretty good about making sure

1257
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,760
I need a new PC anyways

1258
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,760
I've been looking at getting either a new laptop

1259
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,760
Or a new desktop

1260
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,760
But the laptops are pretty decent for the price

1261
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,760
And now they have the new Ryzen chips that came out

1262
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,760
Which look pretty nice

1263
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,760
My out of date monster will run Overwatch

1264
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,760
So

1265
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,760
This probably will

1266
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,760
I don't know

1267
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,760
I would use controller though

1268
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,760
I guess I would lose that against keyboard mouse right?

1269
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,760
Probably

1270
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,760
Unless, well play a character

1271
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,760
Like Torbjorn or Symmetra where you can set up

1272
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,760
Like turrets and robots to do

1273
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,760
The things for you that might help

1274
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,760
Anyway, so I've been playing some Overwatch

1275
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,760
Then let's see I was continuing to play

1276
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,760
Skyrim HD which I talked about a little bit last week

1277
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,760
I was playing that a little more on

1278
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,760
Xbox One and still really

1279
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,760
Enjoy the graphics, like I'm like okay wow

1280
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,760
This game really does look good you know

1281
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,760
It makes me very excited for Elder Scrolls 6

1282
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,760
Which I hope they announce sooner rather than later

1283
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,760
Even though I think it's going to be a

1284
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,760
Fallout game this year

1285
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,760
Like a New Vegas 2 or something

1286
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,760
Another one? But they just did Fallout 4

1287
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,760
Fallout New Vegas 2 or whatever it is

1288
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,760
I think is what the rumors say for this year

1289
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,760
No

1290
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:09,760
We'll see, we'll see

1291
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,760
Other than that I did download a few new things

1292
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,760
I did not realize

1293
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,760
This was on Playstation 4

1294
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,760
But I think it just came out recently

1295
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,760
Which was a Chinese rooms

1296
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,760
Game that they did

1297
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,760
Before, it was only one of their first games

1298
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,760
It was the Half-Life mod that there was a

1299
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,760
Spinoff game before they did

1300
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,760
Everybody's Gone to the Rapture, which you know

1301
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,760
I loved that game, so the fact that

1302
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,760
It was only like, because they're doing a big sale

1303
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,760
On Playstation right now so it was only like 4 or 5 bucks

1304
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,760
For Dear Esther even though I think it's new

1305
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,760
On Playstation 4, it's not a new game at all

1306
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,760
It's been out for like 10 years, but I'd never played it

1307
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,760
So I wanted to get in there and play it

1308
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:45,760
And I didn't get super far in it

1309
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,760
I didn't really like talk about the story or anything yet

1310
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,760
But it is really pretty

1311
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,760
I mean, again, the fact that it's not on Playstation 4

1312
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,760
Like, you know, walking on these

1313
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,760
Barren cliffs

1314
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,760
By the ocean and this grey

1315
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:59,760
Very dreary setting

1316
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,760
It does look gorgeous

1317
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,760
For what it's worth, so I had fun with that

1318
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,760
And then another game I downloaded which I played a little more of

1319
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,760
Which I did enjoy

1320
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,760
Was this little game called Enter the Gungeon

1321
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,760
Which I played a little bit of, lowkey

1322
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,760
I saw that

1323
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,760
Did you see that when I was playing that?

1324
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,760
So that was fun, I liked that

1325
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,760
It's pretty much like a roguelike

1326
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,760
I guess

1327
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,760
But with guns, and yes you do

1328
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,760
You go through the dungeon, you find stronger guns

1329
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,760
To take on more bosses

1330
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,760
And find more guns

1331
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,760
And bosses based off guns

1332
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,760
So I didn't play a lot

1333
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,760
But I played enough, I played through the tutorial

1334
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,760
And then I was playing the beginning stage a little bit

1335
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,760
I got through at least the first floor

1336
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,760
And beat one of the bosses

1337
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,760
Which is kind of weird

1338
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,760
So yeah I was having fun with that

1339
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,760
And I didn't realize in the theme song

1340
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,760
To Enter the Gungeon, they actually have a whole custom thing

1341
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,760
Where they're actually singing about the Gungeon

1342
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,760
So that was a nice touch

1343
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,760
Props to them

1344
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,760
So I was enjoying that

1345
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,760
So that was pretty much my gaming week

1346
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,760
Alright

1347
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,760
I was getting into housekeeping here

1348
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,760
But there's not a lot to tell you

1349
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,760
Besides please follow us on Twitter

1350
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,760
We're also on Facebook

1351
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,760
And I do want to mention

1352
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,760
On Twitch TV

1353
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:16,760
We not only have our own channel on Twitch

1354
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:18,760
Which we haven't really been using a lot of recently

1355
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,760
Admittedly, but we are trying to build up the presence

1356
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:22,760
For VOG Network over on Twitch

1357
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:24,760
If you do follow VOG Network

1358
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:26,760
Over on Twitch

1359
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,760
Several of the hosts that do things here at VOG Network

1360
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:30,760
We auto host their feeds

1361
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:32,760
And at a later time we're hoping to bring you some content

1362
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:34,760
Original to the Twitch feed of VOG Network as well

1363
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:36,760
So check that out

1364
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:38,760
We were talking about that a little bit on last week's show

1365
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:40,760
And then Bobby went in and like

1366
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:42,760
Figured out how to get back in there

1367
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:44,760
And made sure it was up and running this week

1368
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,760
So he did all that, so thanks Bobby

1369
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:48,760
So check that out

1370
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:50,760
Let's get into some gaming news

1371
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,760
Lots more to cover, right Loki?

1372
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:54,760
Yep, and as I was talking about

1373
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:56,760
My gaming week this week I of course played

1374
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:58,760
Lots of the Playstation VR

1375
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:00,760
And apparently it's selling pretty well as well

1376
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,760
So they're also

1377
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:04,760
They have revealed that as of February 19th

1378
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:06,760
They've sold about

1379
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:08,760
915,000 units

1380
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,760
So they're actually

1381
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:12,760
Expected to hit their estimate

1382
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,760
Of about 1 million units by mid April

1383
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:16,760
Originally they were

1384
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:18,760
Forecasting 2.6 million units

1385
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:20,760
But of course they lowered that down to

1386
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:22,760
750,000 which they've

1387
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:24,760
Already exceeded, so

1388
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:26,760
Good for them, apparently that makes the

1389
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:28,760
Playstation VR the highest selling headset

1390
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:30,760
Of the three main contenders

1391
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:32,760
The Vive, Rift, and

1392
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:34,760
Gear VR

1393
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:36,760
Alright no I'm sorry

1394
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,760
It's actually the Vive and the Rift

1395
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:40,760
Including the Playstation VR

1396
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,760
The Gear VR is actually I think sold

1397
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:44,760
A little bit better

1398
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,760
So hopefully this bodes well for Sony actually

1399
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:48,760
Continuing to support it

1400
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:50,760
Because there was some of us worried that it could go down a path like the Vita

1401
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,760
I still think

1402
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:54,760
Just everybody show that stuff

1403
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:56,760
They get really

1404
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:58,760
Wowed by it

1405
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:00,760
So I still think it's just getting

1406
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:02,760
It in the people's faces basically

1407
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:04,760
To try it

1408
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:06,760
And once they've tried it

1409
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:08,760
I don't think I've ever had anyone go

1410
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:10,760
Oh that's dumb

1411
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:12,760
Or like this is never going to take off

1412
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:14,760
It's always been like holy shit

1413
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:16,760
Just amazing

1414
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:18,760
That this is

1415
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:20,760
Even a thing

1416
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:22,760
And so it's just getting people to try it

1417
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,760
And once they've tried it then they pretty much

1418
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:26,760
Become evangelists for it

1419
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,760
I don't know if you guys know

1420
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:30,760
But I never did end up getting one

1421
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:32,760
For Pro which in retrospect

1422
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:34,760
Was probably the wrong decision to be honest

1423
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:36,760
But it's okay

1424
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:38,760
I own it

1425
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:40,760
Well I don't know

1426
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:42,760
I don't know if I'd be using the Playstation VR

1427
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:44,760
The whole time if I owned it

1428
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:46,760
Do you use it regularly?

1429
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,760
I have been recently using it more often

1430
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,760
I haven't really been playing VR games in it

1431
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,760
But I'm always like whenever they have sales

1432
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:54,760
And stuff I'm always looking to see what games are on sale

1433
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:56,760
And I do have some in my backlog

1434
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:58,760
That I get to play

1435
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:00,760
It's funny actually the other day

1436
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:02,760
I was looking through my catalog of stuff

1437
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,760
I'm like man I thought I had more games than this

1438
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:06,760
And then I looked and I'm like

1439
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:08,760
Oh wait that's stuff that's been downloaded

1440
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:10,760
And I'm like 187 games

1441
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:12,760
Holy shit

1442
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:14,760
My Playstation library is looking just like

1443
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:16,760
My Steam library

1444
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:18,760
But yeah there's like

1445
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:20,760
Oh I bought Need for Speed

1446
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:22,760
And Dragon Age Inquisition

1447
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:24,760
When the fuck did that happen?

1448
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:26,760
Silly stuff

1449
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,760
Not really a game I would play

1450
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,760
But I definitely want to try it in VR

1451
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,760
I played for just a little bit this week

1452
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,760
I played Rez

1453
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,760
The new one that came out

1454
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,760
The reimagining for the second time

1455
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,760
But I don't have Playstation VR

1456
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:43,760
I've just been playing it on the TV

1457
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,760
And I still love it

1458
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,760
I do kind of

1459
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,760
If I had a VR thing I would like to play this

1460
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,760
God so many cords everywhere

1461
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:53,760
With that VR headset

1462
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,760
My house is already a mess

1463
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,760
I mean really

1464
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:59,760
Because you just have the one that combines

1465
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,760
The HDMI and whatever

1466
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,760
That other thing

1467
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,760
So it's basically

1468
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,760
Just that and then everything plugs into it

1469
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,760
I mean yeah you can kind of twist it up

1470
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,760
And stuff but

1471
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,760
Just don't be stupid don't spin around circles

1472
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,760
Like my son does

1473
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:17,760
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says the PSVR has

1474
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,760
Almost sold as much as Eye of Judgment

1475
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,760
No Eye of Judgment

1476
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:23,760
Will never sell that

1477
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,760
Eye of Judgment is dead

1478
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:27,760
It's gone

1479
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,760
That bet is never happening

1480
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,760
They stopped making them

1481
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,760
It's over

1482
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:35,760
They didn't make a million of them

1483
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,760
Unless you could always hope

1484
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,760
Now here's what you have to do

1485
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:41,760
Here's what y'all have to hope for if you want Loki in the tingle outfit

1486
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:43,760
You need

1487
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:45,760
And for those that are newer to OLR

1488
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:47,760
And don't understand what this joke is

1489
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,760
When the Eye of Judgment

1490
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:51,760
The Playstation 3

1491
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,760
There was this game that they were doing

1492
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,760
With a game

1493
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:57,760
It was an augmented reality card game

1494
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,760
And it was dumb because you played an actual card game

1495
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,760
And all it did was

1496
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,760
Change the graphics on the TV

1497
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,760
And it was like

1498
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,760
Wasn't it expensive too?

1499
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,760
It was just not a very well thought out idea

1500
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,760
I mean I'm sure the game

1501
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,760
We went and saw the demo

1502
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,760
At E3 and I was just like

1503
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:17,760
I don't see the point

1504
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,760
Somebody didn't really think this through

1505
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:21,760
Somebody was like

1506
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,760
It's the Ryan Reynolds picture

1507
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:25,760
But why?

1508
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:27,760
But you jump to conclusions

1509
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:29,760
But why?

1510
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:31,760
So anyway

1511
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,760
The whole bet was

1512
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:35,760
That if they would sell

1513
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,760
And Loki was like it's never gonna sell

1514
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:39,760
So I don't even know how it happened

1515
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,760
But Loki made a bet and said look

1516
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,760
If the Eye of Judgment sells a million copies

1517
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,760
I will come to the show dressed as Tingle

1518
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,760
From the Legend of Zelda singles

1519
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,760
It was a talk like Tingle

1520
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,760
I don't know what the hell the thing was

1521
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,760
Well at the time we were on camera

1522
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:55,760
We were on Justin TV at the time

1523
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:57,760
And so you would do your little dance on camera

1524
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,760
And we'd all have a good laugh

1525
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:01,760
But you knew in the back of your mind that's never gonna fucking happen

1526
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:03,760
No it's never gonna happen

1527
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:05,760
It was a safe bet

1528
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:07,760
It's garbage

1529
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:09,760
So here's what you all need to hope for

1530
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,760
If you want Loki to ever dress up as Tingle

1531
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:13,760
Which just isn't gonna happen at this point

1532
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:15,760
And Sony does this sometimes

1533
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,760
For a new piece of technology

1534
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,760
Cause Sony does this right

1535
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:21,760
Sony said they do the

1536
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,760
With the Playstation

1537
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:25,760
Their online magazine thing

1538
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:27,760
They reclaim the name or something

1539
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,760
So sometimes Sony will reclaim names

1540
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,760
And use them for other things

1541
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:33,760
So maybe they'll bring back Eye of Judgment

1542
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,760
And it's like a new game

1543
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,760
Or it's a new something

1544
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:39,760
Like something in virtual reality

1545
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,760
And it's fucking awesome and sells ten million copies

1546
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,760
Now we can sit here and say Loki

1547
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:46,760
That's not the same Eye of Judgment though

1548
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:50,760
Cause someone can make a game called

1549
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:52,760
The Eye of Judgment

1550
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:54,760
Like a free to play game

1551
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:56,760
I don't know like a one penny game

1552
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:58,760
And they'll sell it and say ha ha

1553
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:00,760
See they sold a million copies

1554
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:02,760
No but the bet was Sony has to sell

1555
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:04,760
A million copies of the Eye of Judgment

1556
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:06,760
Anyhow

1557
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:08,760
Not gonna happen

1558
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:10,760
Let's see

1559
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:12,760
Bobby Blackwolf pointing out

1560
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:15,760
That's right

1561
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,760
And I think all these years later

1562
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,760
Bobby was very protective of the secrets

1563
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:21,760
But I think I'm safe to tell you

1564
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:23,760
If you never found Loki and Flappy Vog

1565
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,760
As Tingle, it's in there

1566
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:27,760
And you need to play more

1567
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:29,760
I'll leave you with that

1568
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,760
If Bobby wants to just yell it in chat

1569
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:33,760
If you play enough of Loki

1570
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:35,760
In Flappy Vog

1571
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:37,760
Eventually you'll get Loki as Tingle

1572
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:39,760
Yes it was an embarrassing part of my life

1573
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:41,760
But it's hilarious actually

1574
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:43,760
I recorded that

1575
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:45,760
I recorded that in my car

1576
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:47,760
Off my laptop in the rain

1577
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:49,760
In the parking lot of my work

1578
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:51,760
Because there is no quiet place

1579
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:53,760
To make those noises

1580
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:55,760
At my place of employment

1581
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,760
Without

1582
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,760
Embarrassing myself

1583
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,760
He does the voices you guys

1584
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:03,760
It's worth revisiting Flappy Vog

1585
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:05,760
This week and checking that out if you never saw that

1586
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,760
Alright anyway

1587
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:09,760
Let's move on

1588
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:11,760
Register participation for this week's episode of

1589
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:13,760
Orange Laundry Radio at vognetwork.com

1590
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:15,760
Use the passphrase, inch

1591
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:17,760
ActDeft in chat points out

1592
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:19,760
It was kind of random

1593
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:21,760
Alright anyway let's talk about speaking of random

1594
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:23,760
Fallout Fantasy 15 has been getting

1595
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:25,760
Updates here and there and they finally released

1596
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:27,760
What like a booster pack this week

1597
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:29,760
Patch 1.05

1598
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:31,760
Released this week which

1599
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:33,760
Supports this new booster pack which has

1600
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:35,760
Some items for fishing

1601
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,760
All I know is it tried to download the update on my system

1602
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:39,760
I don't have enough hard drive space for that

1603
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,760
Oh gosh is it really that big of a

1604
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:43,760
Hell no must have been

1605
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:45,760
Well anyway there is a new level cap

1606
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:47,760
For your characters you can go up to 125

1607
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:49,760
In levels you can also store

1608
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:51,760
200 Prompto pictures now

1609
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:53,760
And there is also an MP3 player

1610
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:55,760
For Noctis when you are riding on a

1611
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:57,760
Chocobo which you didn't have before

1612
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:59,760
But also the 1.05 update

1613
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:01,760
Is the long awaited

1614
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:03,760
PlayStation 4 patch

1615
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,760
Which will allow the frame rate

1616
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:07,760
To go up to a maximum of 60 frames a second

1617
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:09,760
On a PlayStation Pro

1618
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:11,760
I'm a PlayStation 4 Pro

1619
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:13,760
Owner and let me tell you

1620
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:15,760
I haven't noticed a difference

1621
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:17,760
Playing Fallout Fantasy 15 under this new patch

1622
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:19,760
Granted I didn't do a lot

1623
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,760
But when I did play

1624
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:23,760
I didn't notice a difference

1625
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:25,760
So good job on that investment

1626
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:27,760
Rob PlayStation 4 Pro

1627
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:29,760
Anyway

1628
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,760
Some users out there on the internet

1629
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:33,760
Noticing that some of the frame rates

1630
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,760
And the transition between different frame rates

1631
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:37,760
Is pretty jarring

1632
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:39,760
So I guess

1633
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:41,760
Maybe I'm not playing in the right mode

1634
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:43,760
Do I need to actually go into the high mode

1635
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:45,760
Maybe that's why I didn't do right

1636
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:47,760
So maybe I'll go back

1637
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:49,760
And tinker with that a little bit

1638
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:51,760
Just to see if I can get the game to

1639
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:53,760
Look even prettier but

1640
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:55,760
It looked good enough for what it's worth

1641
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:57,760
Anyway

1642
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:59,760
I guess near playlists were added

1643
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:01,760
To the game too

1644
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:03,760
As you're driving around you can actually listen to the soundtracks

1645
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,760
Near if you want to hear that

1646
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:07,760
Sure cool

1647
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:09,760
Alright

1648
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,760
How about the DLC with Gladio and all that stuff

1649
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:13,760
That's what I'm really waiting for

1650
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:15,760
Cup noodle

1651
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:17,760
Yeah my cup noodle hat where's that

1652
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:19,760
Can't wait for that

1653
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:21,760
Moving on Dark Sakura

1654
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:23,760
What do you have for us

1655
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:25,760
I have stuff

1656
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:27,760
Very sad stuff

1657
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:29,760
A moment of silence if you will

1658
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:31,760
Alan Stone who was the co-founder

1659
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:33,760
Of Nintendo of America

1660
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:35,760
Died

1661
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:37,760
It was reported on February 23

1662
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:39,760
He died at

1663
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,760
71 from cancer

1664
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,760
71 is still a decent run

1665
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,760
But still you know

1666
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:47,760
With current life spans that is

1667
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:49,760
A little short still

1668
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:51,760
He was

1669
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:53,760
One of the people behind getting

1670
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:55,760
You know the original Mario Brothers

1671
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:57,760
And Donkey Kong

1672
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:59,760
To be as popular as it was

1673
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:01,760
Over here and so we actually

1674
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:03,760
I would even say oh the

1675
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:05,760
Resurgence of video gaming in America

1676
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:07,760
To him so

1677
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:09,760
RIP

1678
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:11,760
People probably don't remember that

1679
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,760
You know there was a lot of stores out there

1680
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:15,760
That were really tepid

1681
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:17,760
On stocking Nintendo

1682
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:19,760
And Sega after

1683
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:21,760
The huge video game crash and you know

1684
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:23,760
Nintendo of America had to work very hard

1685
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:25,760
To make Nintendo

1686
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,760
A success in this country which they did

1687
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:29,760
So yeah I think

1688
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:31,760
We owe a lot to

1689
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:33,760
You know what Alan Stone

1690
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:35,760
Did and fuck cancer etc

1691
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:37,760
Indeed

1692
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:39,760
It's

1693
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:41,760
Also I don't know was he still involved

1694
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:43,760
With Nintendo in later years

1695
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:45,760
Or probably not

1696
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:47,760
Because I was going to say it really kind of sucks

1697
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:49,760
Here we are a week before the Switch releases

1698
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:51,760
I'm pretty sure he would have been excited to see that

1699
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:53,760
But he probably had moved on from Nintendo

1700
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:55,760
Later in his career as you know people come

1701
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:57,760
And go from jobs all the time in different companies

1702
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:59,760
So but anyway a tip

1703
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,760
Of the hat there for Alan Stone

1704
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:03,760
And thank you

1705
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:05,760
For everything you did to set up Nintendo

1706
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:07,760
In America

1707
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,760
Loki let's change the subject

1708
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:11,760
Something a little brighter please

1709
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:13,760
Yes definitely a little bit brighter because

1710
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,760
We're going to be talking about sunset overdrive

1711
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:17,760
And that was a pretty bright game

1712
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,760
Yes it was it was a very fluorescent game

1713
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:21,760
So you know

1714
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:23,760
It didn't do as well as Microsoft had hoped

1715
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:25,760
But

1716
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:27,760
They're saying that they still may continue on

1717
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:29,760
Even without Microsoft

1718
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:31,760
So

1719
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:33,760
You know basically you know the president

1720
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:35,760
Of Insomniac Ted Price

1721
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:37,760
Said that while there hasn't been any movement

1722
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:39,760
On a sequel you'd you know

1723
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:41,760
Have asked Microsoft about that

1724
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:43,760
But we're passionate about the franchise

1725
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:45,760
And we own it so you may see more

1726
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:47,760
Sunset in the future from us

1727
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:49,760
No promises and no timeline

1728
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:51,760
To speak of but it's something

1729
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:53,760
That represents our willingness to create

1730
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:55,760
Unexpected experiences

1731
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,760
And of course they're working on the new Spider-Man

1732
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:59,760
Right now

1733
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:01,760
I would be totally down for cross-platform

1734
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:03,760
Sunset overdrive game or hey

1735
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:05,760
Sony exclusive

1736
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:07,760
Sunset overdrive game

1737
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:09,760
Oh yeah I know

1738
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:11,760
I know people that really enjoyed sunset overdrive

1739
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:13,760
I didn't I didn't get into it

1740
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:15,760
I kind of tried to play it but I really didn't

1741
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:17,760
Get into it the way I think a lot of people did

1742
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:19,760
But I know there's a lot of people who'd be very happy

1743
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:21,760
To see them kind of continue it because

1744
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:23,760
I don't think it sold to the expectations

1745
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:25,760
That Microsoft had I mean Microsoft

1746
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:27,760
Gave it away during one of those games with gold

1747
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:29,760
Promotions at one point so

1748
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:31,760
You know I don't think it quite had the sales that

1749
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:33,760
They'd hoped for but yet NAC

1750
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:35,760
Still hasn't been given away yet

1751
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:37,760
That's you know what that's a good point and NAC is getting a

1752
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:39,760
Sequel you know what that's a darn good point so if NAC

1753
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:41,760
Can get a fucking sequel why can't sunset overdrive

1754
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:43,760
Get a sequel alright that's well put

1755
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:45,760
Loki well put

1756
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:47,760
Alright

1757
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:49,760
Let's move on I know a lot of you are fans

1758
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:51,760
Of Jim Sterling over on YouTube

1759
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:53,760
You're one of them right Loki? Yes I am

1760
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:55,760
You like to watch this well you're probably happy to hear this

1761
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:57,760
I'm very aware of the situation yeah

1762
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:59,760
So you probably know more about this than I do

1763
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:01,760
Apparently what happened the case dismissed

1764
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:03,760
This week with

1765
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:05,760
Jim Sterling fighting with Digital Homicide

1766
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:07,760
This was where Digital Homicide

1767
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:09,760
Did what basically come out and said that

1768
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:11,760
He

1769
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:13,760
Basically was what slander was that what it was about?

1770
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:15,760
It was a whole bunch of stuff so he had done

1771
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:17,760
A bunch he does a series called

1772
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:19,760
Best of Scene Greenlight where he'll show

1773
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:21,760
Off games that are just garbage

1774
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:23,760
And he'll like make fun of them

1775
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:25,760
And then he also does you know like a let's play

1776
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:27,760
Series that he does with

1777
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:29,760
Different games like that and one of the games he showed

1778
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:31,760
Was the Slaughtering Grounds which was this

1779
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:33,760
Like you know very

1780
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:35,760
Basic first person shooter game that

1781
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,760
Used a bunch of pre-bought assets from the Unity

1782
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,760
Store and didn't really do anything

1783
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:41,760
And so he just you know

1784
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:43,760
Called it like an asset flip and so

1785
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:45,760
Then James Romain

1786
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:47,760
Who was part of

1787
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:49,760
Digital Homicide

1788
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,760
Came out with a video slamming

1789
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:53,760
Him on his review of the game

1790
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:55,760
To which you know he's like this isn't a review

1791
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:57,760
It's a let's play and then

1792
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:59,760
So he decided to do a

1793
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:01,760
Review of a review

1794
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,760
And like did that and I think it even

1795
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:05,760
Went another step further but

1796
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:07,760
It came down to like they were saying that he

1797
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:09,760
You know was

1798
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:11,760
Slandering them and he caused them

1799
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:13,760
Financial harm and they were trying to sue him for like

1800
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:15,760
Ten million dollars when in reality he

1801
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:17,760
Probably brought more publicity to their game

1802
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:19,760
Right and then they would have had otherwise

1803
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:21,760
These guys weren't exactly right in the head

1804
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:23,760
Anyways let me get in the heat like

1805
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:25,760
Allegedly don't sue us

1806
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:27,760
He um you know

1807
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:29,760
Also like did like an interview with him and stuff

1808
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:31,760
And it was just it was

1809
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:33,760
Cringy but so to make a

1810
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:35,760
Long story short he went this

1811
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,760
Went you know they pursued him

1812
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:39,760
You know sued him and he got

1813
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:41,760
A dismiss with prejudice so he's

1814
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:43,760
Um you know

1815
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:45,760
Free to do whatever on this he's supposed to make

1816
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:47,760
Like a video about it on Monday

1817
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:49,760
Actually regarding this dismissal

1818
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:51,760
Um but yeah I mean these are the same guys

1819
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:53,760
That try to sue steam reviews

1820
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:55,760
You know sue people like

1821
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:57,760
To find you know who's

1822
01:07:57,760 --> 01:07:59,760
Leaving bad reviews on their game so they can go off

1823
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:01,760
Through them monetarily and then

1824
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:03,760
Then steam of course pulled their games off of

1825
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:05,760
You know

1826
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:07,760
Here's the thing that I think kind of sucks about this

1827
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:09,760
Is that you know there's the whole you can read

1828
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:11,760
The motion for dismissal it's all public and online

1829
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:13,760
Both parties have to

1830
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:15,760
Bear their own attorney and filing fees

1831
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:17,760
So that means he

1832
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:19,760
Jim Sterling still had to pay for the attorney

1833
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:21,760
And the filing which he shouldn't have to do that

1834
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:23,760
No he shouldn't the other parties should have to pay for that

1835
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:25,760
Here's the thing the reason the thought

1836
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:27,760
Well the thought of it is

1837
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:29,760
That it was more of like

1838
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:31,760
Jim Sterling being nice about it because

1839
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:33,760
He could have pursued it

1840
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:35,760
Further to get those attorney fees but he's just kind of like

1841
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:37,760
Fuck this I just want to be done with them

1842
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:39,760
Using the YouTube

1843
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:41,760
Ad revenue from the videos about it to pay for it

1844
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:43,760
Well it's just like he just wants to be done with them

1845
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:45,760
I think because he had a

1846
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:47,760
Strong case to where he could have gotten damages

1847
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:49,760
From them but it's more of just let's just

1848
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:51,760
Forget about it you know let's just

1849
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:53,760
Leave it and I'm just

1850
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:55,760
Going to still make fun of you but you know

1851
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:57,760
There's not much you can do about it

1852
01:08:57,760 --> 01:08:59,760
So you know basically now they just said

1853
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:01,760
Any time that they

1854
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:03,760
They're not allowed to you know file

1855
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:05,760
Complaints regarding this of course

1856
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:07,760
If they do file any additional complaints not

1857
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:09,760
Documented in there they have to make sure

1858
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:11,760
That they're considering fair use and

1859
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:13,760
Some other thing I don't remember

1860
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:15,760
The exact

1861
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:17,760
Wording of it but yeah

1862
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:19,760
I mean that's kind of what's been going on

1863
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:21,760
It's been going on for a few months

1864
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:23,760
Now I think

1865
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:25,760
Geez

1866
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:27,760
Alright well I think this is interesting too

1867
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:29,760
I didn't realize this in order to file

1868
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:31,760
A lawsuit in Arizona the guy

1869
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:33,760
Contributed to the

1870
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:35,760
Patreon a dollar a month to

1871
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:37,760
Say that he does business in Arizona in order to

1872
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:39,760
File the lawsuit there

1873
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:41,760
It's shady shit

1874
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:43,760
That is shady as fuck

1875
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:45,760
Well be careful if you set up one of those

1876
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:47,760
Patreons because I know a lot of people are setting

1877
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:49,760
Those up but there's another great reason

1878
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:51,760
Why OLR hasn't exactly

1879
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:53,760
Jumped in on Patreon yet you know

1880
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:55,760
Legal things like that

1881
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,760
So anyway I don't have the fucking money

1882
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:59,760
To pay a lawyer like

1883
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:01,760
Anyway

1884
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:03,760
Let's move on

1885
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:05,760
People need to

1886
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:07,760
Just stop suing everybody over stupid things

1887
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:09,760
Y'all need Jesus

1888
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:11,760
Or whatever

1889
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:13,760
Y'all need

1890
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:15,760
A lobotomy

1891
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:17,760
Moving on

1892
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:19,760
Y'all need to go outside right Darsyra

1893
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:21,760
Yeah go outside and play some Pokemon Go

1894
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:23,760
Well as

1895
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:25,760
We know or may

1896
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:27,760
Have known and forgotten

1897
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:29,760
Or did not give a shit about

1898
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:31,760
Pokemon's 21st anniversary

1899
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:33,760
Is coming up so Niantic

1900
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:35,760
Is doing

1901
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:37,760
An event from February 26th

1902
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:39,760
Until March 6th

1903
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:41,760
For the anniversary

1904
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:43,760
It's going to be Pokemon day

1905
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:45,760
Or in that case Pokemon week

1906
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:47,760
Where you can

1907
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:49,760
Catch a special Pikachu

1908
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:51,760
He'll be wearing a party hat

1909
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:53,760
Just like the Santa Pikachus

1910
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:55,760
And so I am going to be

1911
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:57,760
Going on a Pikachu hunt

1912
01:10:57,760 --> 01:10:59,760
I'm just going to hang out in the park by your house

1913
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:01,760
And hunt Pikachu

1914
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:03,760
Yeah I'll have to get one of those

1915
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:05,760
So I can have all the different Pikachu hats

1916
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:07,760
It's all about hats

1917
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:09,760
I have the um

1918
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:11,760
Both the Christmas Pikachu and Raichu

1919
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:13,760
And I want the party hat Pikachu and Raichu

1920
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:15,760
Instead of Raichu there but I would assume Raichu would

1921
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:17,760
Yeah if it's like the Santa hats

1922
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:19,760
Then you should be able to evolve a Pikachu

1923
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:21,760
With a party hat and get a Raichu with a party hat

1924
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:23,760
Party too

1925
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:25,760
But that's really it

1926
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:27,760
I'm excited to catch a party too

1927
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:29,760
Will they spawn more Pikachu so you have a better chance to catch them

1928
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:31,760
Or are you going to have to find

1929
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:33,760
I don't see anything about that

1930
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:35,760
Well here's a pro tip there is some Pikachu nests

1931
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:37,760
Up in Sacramento so you just have to look at

1932
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:39,760
I missed my Porygon chance

1933
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:41,760
You did miss your Porygon chance

1934
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:43,760
They were all over during the Valentine day event

1935
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:45,760
Well I'll just do it next year

1936
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:47,760
That's what they all say

1937
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:49,760
Alright

1938
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:51,760
He's saying in his best Adore Delano voice

1939
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:53,760
Party

1940
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:55,760
Party

1941
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:57,760
Loki what do you have for us before we get to the classic game of the week

1942
01:11:57,760 --> 01:11:59,760
So apparently now you have

1943
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:01,760
The ability through Twitch to

1944
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:03,760
Change your name

1945
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:05,760
Now changing your username

1946
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:07,760
Also not only does it change your name

1947
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:09,760
That everyone can view it

1948
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:11,760
It also changes your channels URL

1949
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,760
Of course

1950
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:15,760
They're saying that your old URL won't

1951
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:17,760
Redirect to the new one

1952
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:19,760
And then you can use that feature

1953
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:21,760
Once every 60 days

1954
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:23,760
And of course you can only change

1955
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:25,760
The name that's available

1956
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:27,760
I never realized

1957
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:29,760
That you could not change your Twitch name

1958
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,760
This seems like one of those

1959
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:33,760
Really obvious things

1960
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:35,760
That I wonder why it wasn't in place before

1961
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:37,760
But okay

1962
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:39,760
Well I know

1963
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:41,760
In the past certain things have been tied

1964
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:43,760
To actual names on the accounts

1965
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:45,760
Like an account number

1966
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:47,760
And so if they

1967
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:49,760
Made that change

1968
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:51,760
Where they assigned account numbers to everything

1969
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:53,760
Then they could do that

1970
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:55,760
Because that was like

1971
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:57,760
I think Sony

1972
01:12:57,760 --> 01:12:59,760
Can you change your name on the

1973
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:01,760
Playstation now

1974
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:03,760
No and that's a very

1975
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:05,760
That's a thing that some people have problems with

1976
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:07,760
I thought that was something they were working on

1977
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:09,760
So I think that's the same process

1978
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:11,760
They have to assign your account a number

1979
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:13,760
And once they have everybody to a number

1980
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:15,760
They can go and allow you to

1981
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:17,760
Change those names

1982
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:21,760
Alright

1983
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:23,760
So if I want to change my name to Mob Moberts

1984
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:25,760
I can do that now

1985
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:27,760
Yes, as long as it's not taken

1986
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:29,760
As long as it's not already taken

1987
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:31,760
Don't take it or I'll sue you like that guy

1988
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:33,760
Alright let's talk about this

1989
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:35,760
Before we get into the classic game of the week

1990
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:37,760
And it has to do with Unity

1991
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:39,760
The Unity game engine is

1992
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:41,760
Being used for more than just games

1993
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:43,760
There's other things that are using it

1994
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:45,760
In fact there's a brand new French

1995
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:47,760
Animation show called Mr. Carton

1996
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:49,760
That is now the first

1997
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:51,760
Cartoon TV series

1998
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:53,760
Made in Unity

1999
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:55,760
So now you can make a television cartoon

2000
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:57,760
In Unity, which makes me think

2001
01:13:57,760 --> 01:13:59,760
How easy would it be to port that cartoon to other devices

2002
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:01,760
Through Unity

2003
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:03,760
Which also makes me think

2004
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:05,760
Remember when the 3DS was going to get movies

2005
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:07,760
Whatever happened to that?

2006
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:09,760
What happened to Tron or Tangled

2007
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:11,760
In 3D on the DS, what happened to that?

2008
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:13,760
Instead we got Dinosaur Office

2009
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:15,760
Look at Tekken, the Tekken movie was in

2010
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:17,760
Was the Tekken movie out?

2011
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:19,760
Because I think if there was a version of Tekken

2012
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:21,760
On the 3DS

2013
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:23,760
That actually had that movie

2014
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:25,760
Bundled with it

2015
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:27,760
I was going to say

2016
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:29,760
This is something that they've been pushing with Unity

2017
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:31,760
Because they had that whole tech demo

2018
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:33,760
I don't know if it was just for Unity 5

2019
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:35,760
Or whatever the version of Unity was

2020
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:37,760
But they had this big cinematic

2021
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:39,760
Thing that they put out

2022
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:41,760
And they were saying

2023
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:43,760
Yeah, you could use it for making movies

2024
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:45,760
Yeah, Mr. Carton

2025
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:47,760
Has a 13 episode season that is

2026
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:49,760
Premiering on France

2027
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:51,760
Televisions this week

2028
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:53,760
There's also, I guess 6 episodes have already

2029
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:55,760
Aired and you can actually go check it out on YouTube

2030
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:57,760
If you want, they're just short little

2031
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:59,760
2 minute adventures

2032
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:01,760
And I guess the language barrier

2033
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:03,760
Doesn't really prevent you from enjoying it

2034
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:05,760
Because the cartoon doesn't say much

2035
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:07,760
So you can still kind of enjoy it there

2036
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:09,760
I didn't watch it myself to be honest

2037
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:11,760
But maybe I will knowing that

2038
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:13,760
I don't need to know a lot of French to be able to understand it

2039
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:15,760
The creator of Mr. Carton

2040
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:17,760
Found Unity to be very suitable

2041
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:19,760
For the process saying that sequencing was a lot less

2042
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:21,760
Challenging in Unity than it is

2043
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:23,760
With more traditional methods

2044
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:25,760
Storyboarding and mastering were handled with other applications

2045
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:27,760
But set building, lighting

2046
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:29,760
Rendering and so forth

2047
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:31,760
Was done with Unity

2048
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:33,760
So that's pretty cool

2049
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:35,760
A cartoon

2050
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:37,760
All out of Unity

2051
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:39,760
Alright, let's go back to a simpler time

2052
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:41,760
When you can just

2053
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:43,760
Program your own game

2054
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:45,760
You can just create any game you wanted

2055
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:47,760
Unless it was like pinball construction

2056
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:49,760
Set or something

2057
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:51,760
It's the classic game of the week

2058
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:53,760
Where Dark Soccer is going to step into the gaming vault

2059
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:55,760
And find a game that she thinks

2060
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:57,760
Hey, you brat

2061
01:15:57,760 --> 01:15:59,760
Enough with your newfangled

2062
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:01,760
Switches

2063
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:03,760
I'll show you a switch

2064
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:05,760
Nipple clips

2065
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:07,760
You'll go out to the yard and pick your own

2066
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:09,760
Which is psychological warfare

2067
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:11,760
Believe me

2068
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:13,760
Dark Sakura

2069
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:15,760
What is the classic game of the week

2070
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:17,760
That the kids should be reading about and playing

2071
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:19,760
The game is Crazy Chase

2072
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:21,760
Or as we had it in the US

2073
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:23,760
Casey's Crazy Chase

2074
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:25,760
Who remembers when I did

2075
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:27,760
Casey Munchkin a while back?

2076
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:29,760
Not me

2077
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:31,760
No, actually I thought you had already done this game

2078
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:33,760
Because you did do Casey Munchkin

2079
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:35,760
And I forgot they were different games

2080
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:37,760
I have to talk about a slight bit

2081
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:39,760
Because there was a big

2082
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:41,760
Casey Munchkin was sued

2083
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:43,760
Well, I'd say Phillips was sued

2084
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:45,760
By Atari

2085
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:47,760
Phillips Magnavox

2086
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:49,760
Because Casey

2087
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:51,760
While they didn't advertise

2088
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:53,760
That Casey Munchkin was

2089
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:55,760
Like Pac-Man

2090
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:57,760
In fact, they were very clear not to say it

2091
01:16:57,760 --> 01:16:59,760
So many other people drew the comparison

2092
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:01,760
And were advertising it

2093
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:03,760
That way in catalogs

2094
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:05,760
Even though they said don't do it

2095
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:07,760
That they got sued

2096
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:09,760
By Atari

2097
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:11,760
Because Atari at that point had the home license

2098
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:13,760
For Pac-Man

2099
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:15,760
They

2100
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:17,760
Magnavox won the first suit

2101
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:19,760
But Atari

2102
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:21,760
Appealed and won the

2103
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:23,760
Second court case

2104
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:25,760
So that's that whole drama

2105
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:27,760
In a nutshell

2106
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:29,760
Casey Crazy Chase was a

2107
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:31,760
Sequel and a response

2108
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:33,760
And of course anything that has

2109
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:35,760
The Casey name in it

2110
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:37,760
Comes from the

2111
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:39,760
Phillips electronic president

2112
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:41,760
At the time, Casey Mencken

2113
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:43,760
So, there you go

2114
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:45,760
But this game is a sequel to Casey Munchkin

2115
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:47,760
In this game, it is still a map game

2116
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:49,760
And it actually does have

2117
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:51,760
A lot of the features of Casey Munchkin

2118
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:53,760
They came out

2119
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:55,760
In, let's see

2120
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:57,760
In the UK on the

2121
01:17:57,760 --> 01:17:59,760
Phillips video pack and in North America

2122
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:01,760
On the Magnavox Odyssey 2

2123
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:03,760
But this game

2124
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:05,760
It has a twist on the whole thing

2125
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:07,760
So in Casey Munchkin

2126
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:09,760
You had drats

2127
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:11,760
The little monsters living in the maze

2128
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:13,760
And, you know, your little guy

2129
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:15,760
Would walk around

2130
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:17,760
And eat them and eat dots and stuff

2131
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:19,760
You know, kind of, yeah

2132
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:21,760
Pac-Man-y

2133
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:23,760
You know, had

2134
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:25,760
The same plethora

2135
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:27,760
Of mazes in the level editor

2136
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:29,760
But it just changed everything up

2137
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:31,760
So, you didn't have the dots

2138
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:33,760
And power pellet lookalikes

2139
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:35,760
You know, at all

2140
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:37,760
And instead you had the drats

2141
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:39,760
Who were the monsters

2142
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:41,760
Who would walk around growing trees

2143
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:43,760
And you could go around and eat the trees

2144
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:45,760
But you only got one point per tree

2145
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:47,760
Your main objective was the dratapillar

2146
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:49,760
The dratapillar

2147
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:51,760
I would say bears more than a striking

2148
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:53,760
Resemblance to, uh,

2149
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:55,760
Centipede

2150
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:57,760
In its kind of ball-shaped body

2151
01:18:57,760 --> 01:18:59,760
So I'm gonna call Loki in the future

2152
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:01,760
The dratapillar

2153
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:03,760
Um, and anyway

2154
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:05,760
The way that you solve

2155
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:07,760
The levels and get points

2156
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:09,760
The big points are by going around

2157
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:11,760
And eating the dratapillar's body

2158
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:13,760
Now, first of all

2159
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:15,760
I love, like, the little

2160
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:17,760
Munchkin guy in here

2161
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:19,760
He rolls around all over the place and grins

2162
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:21,760
And when he wins

2163
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:23,760
He kinda smirks and winks at you

2164
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:25,760
Like, they do like a half smile

2165
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:27,760
It's just funny and clever

2166
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:29,760
But anyway, the dratapillar's head

2167
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:31,760
Will totally kill you

2168
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:33,760
So you have to go and you have to chase

2169
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:35,760
Behind it and eat its body

2170
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:37,760
And so when you have eaten all of its body

2171
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:39,760
Um

2172
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:41,760
You can, um

2173
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:43,760
You can also eat pieces in the middle too

2174
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:45,760
But it leaves those body parts there

2175
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:47,760
The dratapillar

2176
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:49,760
The dratapillar will totally kill you

2177
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:51,760
And you have to eat its body

2178
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:53,760
It's kinda morbid, isn't it?

2179
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:55,760
Coming up next on Casey Munchkin

2180
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:57,760
But, um

2181
01:19:57,760 --> 01:19:59,760
But yeah, you can actually even just cut the segment

2182
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:01,760
By its head off by eating it

2183
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:03,760
Which leaves the rest of the segment there

2184
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:05,760
What kind of fucked up things are we teaching children?

2185
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:07,760
It's the 80s, Rob. No one cared

2186
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:09,760
Um, so when you eat a segment

2187
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:11,760
Of the dratapillar, it actually turns the drats

2188
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:13,760
White

2189
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:15,760
And what's kinda funny is like

2190
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:17,760
It's like in those old cartoons, you know

2191
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:19,760
Where the roadrunner would run by the

2192
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:21,760
Coyote and he'd be spinning in the middle of the road

2193
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:23,760
That's kinda what it does, it's pretty cool

2194
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:25,760
Um

2195
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:27,760
And you get 10 points for stunning them

2196
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:29,760
So that's, you know, different ways

2197
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:31,760
To, um, to score

2198
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:33,760
You know, bigger points in the game

2199
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:35,760
But of course, every time you eat a piece of the dratapillar's

2200
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:37,760
Body, it speeds up

2201
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:39,760
So, um

2202
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:41,760
You just have to pretty much be

2203
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:43,760
Fast, think quickly

2204
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:45,760
And, um

2205
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:47,760
You know, run through it. Now, one of the other

2206
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:49,760
Things about this though

2207
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:51,760
Is that it supported the Odyssey 2's voice

2208
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:53,760
Add-on module

2209
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:55,760
Which basically, it, um

2210
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:57,760
It would

2211
01:20:57,760 --> 01:20:59,760
Hum, like, background music

2212
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:01,760
Um, through the game

2213
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:03,760
And then you'd get like, oh no!

2214
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:05,760
When you die, or laughter

2215
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:07,760
Or different things

2216
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:09,760
Um, and of course, with this game

2217
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:11,760
You get one life

2218
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:13,760
So, but it's

2219
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:15,760
It's a neat little game, you know

2220
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:17,760
It was definitely

2221
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:19,760
A unique twist on the maze game genre

2222
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:21,760
And one of the better games

2223
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:23,760
That came out for the Odyssey 2

2224
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:25,760
I spent a lot of time

2225
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:27,760
As a kid, well at the time

2226
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:29,760
I had a Colecovision

2227
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:31,760
I'll take that back, this was a house before that

2228
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:33,760
I didn't have a video game system

2229
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:35,760
We had, uh, The Neighbors, uh, Odyssey 2

2230
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:37,760
I have, I have

2231
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:39,760
One now, and I eventually got one

2232
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:41,760
Later, but, um

2233
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:43,760
I spent so much time on this one

2234
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:45,760
And, um, what was that other

2235
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:47,760
Fucking game that had the board game?

2236
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:51,760
I don't remember. I'll remember it

2237
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:53,760
When I'm totally not thinking

2238
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:55,760
About this. I think I've even done

2239
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:57,760
It for a segment too, so my brain's kinda

2240
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:59,760
Too much coding

2241
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:01,760
Alright, well there it is. But yeah, Casey

2242
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:03,760
Uh, Casey's Crazy Chase, also known

2243
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:05,760
As just Crazy Chase elsewhere. One way

2244
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:07,760
Or another. It's Casey's Crazy Chase

2245
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:09,760
Your classic game of the week

2246
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:11,760
You only get one life

2247
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:13,760
And you have to eat the body

2248
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:15,760
You better not let

2249
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:17,760
That Dratapillar fuck you up

2250
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:19,760
And you better eat its body

2251
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:23,760
And then once you've

2252
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:25,760
Devoured that Dratapillar

2253
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:27,760
You're gonna smile and wink and nod

2254
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:31,760
Did you see when- I did, I was watching

2255
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:33,760
This fucking hilarious- This very rudimentary

2256
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:35,760
Little Atari 2600, excuse me

2257
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:37,760
Odyssey level graphics of a little

2258
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:39,760
Winking face. Like, I just ate

2259
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:41,760
His entire body. He's like, hey

2260
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:43,760
Atari, wink

2261
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:45,760
Fuck you

2262
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:47,760
Next time, I'm gonna eat you from the inside out

2263
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:49,760
It's what I think of your centipede

2264
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:51,760
Yum, yum, yum. He's a Dratapillar

2265
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:53,760
Now

2266
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:55,760
I mean, bleep bleep bleep

2267
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:57,760
And Stoppy is helping you out

2268
01:22:57,760 --> 01:22:59,760
Quest for the Rings. That was it, thank you

2269
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:01,760
Was the board game. I was like, it was something

2270
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:04,760
And you have done that as a classic game before

2271
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:06,760
I have, but we, you know, we had

2272
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:08,760
Like, it was the full thing. We just said fuck the board game

2273
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:09,760
We just play the game

2274
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:11,760
Quest for the Rings, I mean, I remember

2275
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:13,760
That was a pretty, like, for what it was

2276
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:15,760
An old ass game, that was a pretty

2277
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:17,760
Rich, like, pretty

2278
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:19,760
Big game, you know what I mean? Like

2279
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:21,760
The things that it did going into the different rooms and stuff

2280
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:23,760
We were just like, first graders

2281
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:25,760
That didn't give a shit

2282
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:27,760
For second grade, we're like, whatever, we're just gonna play the game

2283
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:29,760
The other thing I was really good at was

2284
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:31,760
Crypt equip. I think that's what it was called

2285
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:33,760
It's the word scramble game

2286
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:35,760
But I was always really good at this, so whatever

2287
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:37,760
Whatever

2288
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:38,760
Alright, that's it

2289
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:40,760
The word is Dratapillar

2290
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:42,760
Dratapillar

2291
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:44,760
You know what? I say now

2292
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:46,760
That if anyone is a shit in chat

2293
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:48,760
They're the Dratapillar

2294
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:50,760
And will eat their bodies and leave the head

2295
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:53,760
That's kinda weird

2296
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:54,760
Poisonous little heads

2297
01:23:54,760 --> 01:23:56,760
That's very weird, you're weird, stop being weird

2298
01:23:56,760 --> 01:23:58,760
You know what?

2299
01:23:58,760 --> 01:24:00,760
So are you, you hang out with me

2300
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:02,760
What does that say about you?

2301
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:04,760
When I'm forced to

2302
01:24:04,760 --> 01:24:06,760
Bitch

2303
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:08,760
Alright, we're gonna take a quick break

2304
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:10,760
Hey Rob, let me do a goddamn break

2305
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:12,760
No, Rob!

2306
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:14,760
What?

2307
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:16,760
Plenty more of this to come

2308
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:18,760
When we come back with more of

2309
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:20,760

Welcome back everybody to

01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:31,760
677th episode of our show

2315
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:33,760
Already in Progress

2316
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:35,760
I'm here, Loki's here

2317
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:37,760
Dark Soccer is here

2318
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:39,760
And you're here, thanks for listening to us

2319
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:41,760
Be it live, during the

2320
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:43,760
Oscar ceremonies

2321
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:45,760
Which I know has been distracting for some people

2322
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:47,760
I have not even been paying attention

2323
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:49,760
I did see some of the pictures of people on the red carpet though

2324
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:51,760
Even though I don't usually get into all that fashion stuff

2325
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:53,760
Outside of like Project Runway

2326
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:55,760
I'm waiting for the fashion photo review version

2327
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:57,760
The fashion photo review or whatever?

2328
01:24:57,760 --> 01:24:59,760
Some of the people on the red carpet look really good

2329
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:01,760
I gotta say, there's been some really good outfits on the red carpet

2330
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:03,760
Did you see what Janelle Monae was wearing?

2331
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:05,760
No, was it a suit?

2332
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:07,760
No, no it was not, it was very much like a

2333
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:09,760
Like a triangular dress type of thing

2334
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:11,760
She looked like she could have been a boss in Final Fantasy

2335
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:13,760
It was great

2336
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:15,760
Go look some of these dresses up

2337
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:17,760
Look amazing on the runway

2338
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:19,760
Anyhow, I wanted to ask you guys about this before we got into

2339
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:21,760
Fire News, before the show, one of our listeners

2340
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:23,760
Tiger Claw sent me a link

2341
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:25,760
And I thought this was an interesting thing to talk about

2342
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:27,760
Since we do like to do classic games, right

2343
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:29,760
And you know, play old games sometimes

2344
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:31,760
And sometimes we have to rely

2345
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:33,760
On emulation to provide

2346
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:35,760
Those games that

2347
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:37,760
You know, might not be accessible otherwise

2348
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:39,760
And that happened to a Super Nintendo

2349
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:41,760
Game this past week, Quick the Thunder Rabbit

2350
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:43,760
Was a platformer for the Super Nintendo

2351
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:45,760
That was never released, it was a port I guess

2352
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:47,760
Of an Amiga title

2353
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:49,760
Oh, did you find the picture?

2354
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:51,760
Yeah, she's got like the whole

2355
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:55,760
Fuck, French Revolution

2356
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:57,760
18th century French

2357
01:25:57,760 --> 01:25:59,760
Dress

2358
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:01,760
The hip bustle

2359
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:03,760
Can I talk about the Thunder Rabbit, please?

2360
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:05,760
I guess

2361
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:07,760
Don't talk about our competition tonight

2362
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:09,760
Janelle Monae, she's talented, but she's our competition, Dark Sakura

2363
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:11,760
Stop talking about her

2364
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:13,760
Anyway, so Quick the Thunder Rabbit on Super Nintendo

2365
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:15,760
Was a port of an Amiga title

2366
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:17,760
And I guess it was a platformer

2367
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:19,760
And it would be like one of those auto scrolling shooter

2368
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:21,760
Games and fighting games and what have you

2369
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:23,760
So somebody actually found

2370
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:25,760
A copy of this game, this user

2371
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:27,760
Online, but he altered the game

2372
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:29,760
When he released it, he edited in a

2373
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:31,760
Splash game, or excuse me

2374
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:33,760
A splash screen to the start of the game

2375
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:35,760
And then made some

2376
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:37,760
Small alterations to the game's

2377
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:39,760
Code, I'm assuming to

2378
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:41,760
Make it run better or

2379
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:43,760
Run more appropriately

2380
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:45,760
Maybe on the forum where this was released

2381
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:47,760
SNES Central asked

2382
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:49,760
In the interest of preservation, would it be possible

2383
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:51,760
To upload the unedited ROM image

2384
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:53,760
And the answer was

2385
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:55,760
No

2386
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:57,760
So some people feeling like

2387
01:26:57,760 --> 01:26:59,760
This is that horrible

2388
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:01,760
Gigantic TMZ

2389
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:03,760
Watermark on a popular

2390
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:05,760
Photo

2391
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:07,760
Or it's like you own a very

2392
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:09,760
Rare painting

2393
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:11,760
And you decide to paint your initials

2394
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:13,760
Or what was that painting

2395
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:15,760
Where somebody like repainted Jesus'

2396
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:17,760
Face, this is a thing that was like

2397
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:19,760
In the news a couple years

2398
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:21,760
Ago where some gal got a rare

2399
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:23,760
Painting and she painted over the face

2400
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:25,760
Or something, it was horrible, anyway

2401
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:27,760
So some people are saying this like that

2402
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:29,760
But it's funny because I'm kind of reminded

2403
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:31,760
Of like back in the day

2404
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:33,760
On like games on Commodore 64

2405
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:35,760
And like the older

2406
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:37,760
PC games, like the splash screens

2407
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:39,760
And the built in trainers and all that shit

2408
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:41,760
Was par for the course, you would see that

2409
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:43,760
Everywhere

2410
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:45,760
But at the same time I also understand why

2411
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:47,760
It's like dude this is not a

2412
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:49,760
Common game by any means

2413
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:51,760
You have the one copy potentially

2414
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:53,760
Give us the actual game

2415
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:55,760
It's kind of a dick move but hey at least you have a copy of the game now

2416
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:57,760
Yeah

2417
01:27:57,760 --> 01:27:59,760
You can play, I mean yeah it sucks that

2418
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:01,760
There were some changes but it's better than nothing

2419
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:03,760
I suppose it's better than nothing

2420
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:05,760
DarkSakura you're big on classic games

2421
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:07,760
Do you think this is defacing a classic

2422
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:09,760
Painting or they have the right to

2423
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:11,760
Do this because they're the only people that have it

2424
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:13,760
I truly do believe that it is

2425
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:15,760
Definitely doing

2426
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:17,760
An injustice

2427
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:19,760
To the game

2428
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:21,760
So

2429
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:23,760
I think that if

2430
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:25,760
It

2431
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:27,760
Well at least, I understand winning it out for preservation

2432
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:29,760
At least in the sake of this

2433
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:31,760
Having an unedited

2434
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:33,760
ROM of the game

2435
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:35,760
Should be still

2436
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:37,760
Distributed for that preservation purpose

2437
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:39,760
In its unadulterated form

2438
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:41,760
It's sort of like

2439
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:43,760
Or how about like this, let me put it this way

2440
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:45,760
Imagine where they found

2441
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:47,760
All of those, you do the x-ray

2442
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:49,760
Of the paintings to see the original painting

2443
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:51,760
Underneath it right

2444
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:53,760
Like for example the beached whale

2445
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:55,760
That was in that one piece of artwork

2446
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:57,760
Or going into Van Gogh's work

2447
01:28:57,760 --> 01:28:59,760
And finding

2448
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:01,760
His, that he's painted over other

2449
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:03,760
Works, you know it's kind of

2450
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:05,760
The same thing

2451
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:07,760
Whether or not it's done in

2452
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:09,760
Um

2453
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:11,760
What's the word I'm thinking of

2454
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:13,760
Done out of

2455
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:15,760
Good taste, done out of

2456
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:17,760
Respect, like good intentions

2457
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:19,760
Good intentions, or even if there had been malice

2458
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:21,760
Behind it, there was no malice in this

2459
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:23,760
At the same time

2460
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:25,760
It would still be

2461
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:27,760
A shame

2462
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:29,760
I don't think they would have had a problem if they just like

2463
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:31,760
Fixed it to run or something like that

2464
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:33,760
Like he put a splash screen

2465
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:35,760
No, actually some people believe

2466
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:37,760
And this story that Tigerclaw sent me

2467
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:39,760
Went on into like an interview with some video game

2468
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:41,760
And actually says, even though

2469
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:43,760
This guy doesn't think he's doing harm

2470
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:45,760
Because he's trying to make the game more playable

2471
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:47,760
It actually still is a disservice because this is a piece

2472
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:49,760
Of gaming's history, you know

2473
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:51,760
He's not the guy who created the original game

2474
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:53,760
I can see that perspective

2475
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:55,760
Here's, okay, here's another one

2476
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:57,760
And this is gonna be highly controversial

2477
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:59,760
But I'm gonna use something that's been a point

2478
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:01,760
Of contention in religious circles

2479
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:03,760
The writings of Josephus

2480
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:05,760
Have been altered ever since

2481
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:07,760
Like

2482
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:09,760
Were altered to say that yes

2483
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:11,760
He saw Jesus

2484
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:13,760
The original writings never said that

2485
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:15,760
I see, I see

2486
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:17,760
But it's the same thing where it goes

2487
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:19,760
In and makes an alteration

2488
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:21,760
It's revisionist history is what it is

2489
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:23,760
It's kind of like how you have

2490
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:25,760
The King James version of the Bible

2491
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:27,760
Right, not to get too religious, but

2492
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:29,760
That's also historical

2493
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:31,760
Not just that, it wasn't necessarily

2494
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:33,760
An interpretation of it, it was

2495
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:35,760
Altered

2496
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:37,760
By picking certain

2497
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:39,760
Items in translation and putting

2498
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:41,760
Them into a way that politically

2499
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:43,760
Benefited his regime

2500
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:45,760
And in this case, we don't know

2501
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:47,760
The reason that this guy did this

2502
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:49,760
If it was as some type of

2503
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:51,760
Reflection on himself

2504
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:53,760
Or some way to hold power

2505
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:55,760
Over the community, we don't know that

2506
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:57,760
My thought is, maybe there's

2507
01:30:57,760 --> 01:30:59,760
Two answers here, like

2508
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:01,760
Release the original cart the way

2509
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:03,760
It was done if it's broken or whatever

2510
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:05,760
And then go ahead and alter it

2511
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:07,760
Release the fixed one and now put your initials on it

2512
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:09,760
Because you did fix the game

2513
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:11,760
Stope has another good comparison

2514
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:13,760
The Diary of Anne Frank

2515
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:15,760
Her father edited it to remove

2516
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:17,760
Her talks about her

2517
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:19,760
Puberty, sexuality

2518
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:21,760
You know, different things that young women

2519
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:23,760
Go through, sure

2520
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:25,760
But again, it's revisionist

2521
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:27,760
It's, in this case,

2522
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:29,760
More of a patriarchal type of control, but still

2523
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:31,760
But it's the same thing

2524
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:33,760
I look at this as no different

2525
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:35,760
Dungeon Buster, with an interesting

2526
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:37,760
Perspective, though, that I think is worth sharing

2527
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:39,760
Over at live.vognetwork.com, says

2528
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:41,760
On the other hand, a lot of the preserved games

2529
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:43,760
On sites like archive.org

2530
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:45,760
For old PCs, they open with

2531
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:47,760
Cracked screens because they're the

2532
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:49,760
Only ones available

2533
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:51,760
And kind of like I said

2534
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:53,760
You know, even though a lot of us

2535
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:55,760
Kind of see what's going on now

2536
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:57,760
As a negative, what this guy is

2537
01:31:57,760 --> 01:31:59,760
Doing was perfectly par

2538
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:01,760
For the course in the 80s and early 90s

2539
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:03,760
It's like a B

2540
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:05,760
It's not an A

2541
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:07,760
Of just releasing it, but hey, you know what

2542
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:09,760
It's working

2543
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:11,760
It's a B movie? What is it?

2544
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:13,760
You're rated on a scale, you know

2545
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:15,760
It's like a B, you know

2546
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:17,760
It could have been better if you released an altered

2547
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:19,760
But at least it's out there

2548
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:21,760
It's like a B

2549
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:23,760
I give it three stars

2550
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:25,760
Out of five

2551
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:27,760
Three out of five

2552
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:29,760
Alright, let's do some

2553
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:31,760
Rapid fire news

2554
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:33,760
Go around quickly and talk about some of the things

2555
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:35,760
That have been happening in the game industry this week

2556
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:37,760
Loki, speaking of something I would give

2557
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:39,760
Three out of five, Irrational

2558
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:41,760
Games, they've changed the name of their

2559
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:43,760
Studio to Ghost

2560
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:45,760
Story Games

2561
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:47,760
Goatsy Games? That's irrational

2562
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:49,760
Ghost Story Games

2563
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:51,760
Ghost Story Games

2564
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:53,760
I hope that you're only making spooky games

2565
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:55,760
Their reasoning before

2566
01:32:55,760 --> 01:32:57,760
They said was because

2567
01:32:57,760 --> 01:32:59,760
It was irrational

2568
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:01,760
Because ghost stories are immersive, exciting

2569
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:03,760
And steeped in the community

2570
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:05,760
That reminds us of our mission

2571
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:09,760
Really, it's just because you couldn't

2572
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:11,760
You're like, ah crap, we gotta

2573
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:13,760
Come up with something guys

2574
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:15,760
Ghost Stories

2575
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:17,760
I have a ghost story for you all

2576
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:19,760
Knock knock

2577
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:21,760
Who's there? Boo

2578
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:23,760
Boo

2579
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:25,760
Who? Don't cry

2580
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:27,760
I have a ghost story for you

2581
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:29,760
What? The Phantom

2582
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:31,760
Of the opera?

2583
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:33,760
No no no, what was that machine

2584
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:35,760
That we saw at E3

2585
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:37,760
Oh oh

2586
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:39,760
Where's my shade sound?

2587
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:41,760
That was like a C plus

2588
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:43,760
Joke, but it was a little intellectual

2589
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:45,760
For the show

2590
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:47,760
Coleco Chameleon Zero

2591
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:49,760
I give that joke

2592
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:51,760
A two out of five

2593
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:53,760
You know what, if I were to

2594
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:55,760
Roll my eyes any higher, I'd be looking

2595
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:57,760
At your backyard

2596
01:33:57,760 --> 01:33:59,760
Actually you'd be looking at a sheet that

2597
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:01,760
That's covering the backyard, anyway

2598
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:05,760
JD and Chaz is

2599
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:07,760
So that's a boot

2600
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:09,760
Are we gonna toot it or boot it?

2601
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:11,760
Alright please move on please move on

2602
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:13,760
We'll keep moving on

2603
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:15,760
So hey, guess what

2604
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:17,760
There's gonna be some more games that are

2605
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:19,760
Backwards compatible with the Xbox One

2606
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:21,760
Toot

2607
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:23,760
So Assassin's Creed Rogue

2608
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:25,760
Borderlands 2

2609
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:27,760
Which is also I think one of the games of the

2610
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:29,760
Gold this month as well

2611
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:31,760
And

2612
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:33,760
King of Fighters 2002 unlimited match

2613
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:35,760
Are now backwards compatible

2614
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:37,760
That's cool

2615
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:39,760
Yeah so

2616
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:41,760
Yeah especially with the fact that

2617
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:43,760
Borderlands 2 they're kind of giving away

2618
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:45,760
For free

2619
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:47,760
Seriously if you have not played Borderlands

2620
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:49,760
My god

2621
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:51,760
Go play Borderlands

2622
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:53,760
Borderlands 2 is fucking awesome

2623
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:55,760
Wasn't one of the big games on Xbox One

2624
01:34:55,760 --> 01:34:57,760
Early on and PlayStation 4 to be fair

2625
01:34:57,760 --> 01:34:59,760
The Handsome Jack collection

2626
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:01,760
Yes I have that in my library

2627
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:03,760
Fucking haven't played it at all

2628
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:05,760
What's funny about that is that

2629
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:07,760
Half that is Borderlands 2

2630
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:09,760
But they went back

2631
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:11,760
And what HD-ified it

2632
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:13,760
I think it wasn't that board

2633
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:15,760
Handsome Jack collection I was one and two

2634
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:17,760
No no it's two and the

2635
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:19,760
Whatever that

2636
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:21,760
Pre-sequel that one

2637
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:23,760
One is not in the Handsome Jack collection

2638
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:25,760
I haven't played Pre-sequel yet so that might be worth it

2639
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:27,760
Once again though

2640
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:29,760
I'm getting into that groove where like

2641
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:31,760
I buy a bunch of shit I'm never gonna play

2642
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:33,760
It's as bad as Steam

2643
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:35,760
I've kind of stopped that on Steam for the most part

2644
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:37,760
For the most part

2645
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:41,760
Oh YYR in chat says Space Invaders Infinity

2646
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:43,760
Gene that's one of the games

2647
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:45,760
That's backwards compatible now

2648
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:47,760
Hell yeah if that is one of them

2649
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:49,760
YYR

2650
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:51,760
If it is it's not in this release

2651
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:53,760
That was a great game on 360

2652
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:55,760
I love when those games

2653
01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:57,760
I bought on 360 just randomly

2654
01:35:57,760 --> 01:35:59,760
Show up on my Xbox One one day

2655
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:01,760
There we go call them back to the

2656
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:03,760
Very opening moments of the show

2657
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:05,760
Things Microsoft is doing right

2658
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:07,760
Backwards compatibility

2659
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:09,760
Better than anybody else right now

2660
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:11,760
Isn't that great that purchases you made on a previous system

2661
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:13,760
Roll over to a newer system

2662
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:15,760
Isn't that something?

2663
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:17,760
That's so crazy

2664
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:19,760
It's as if

2665
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:21,760
With Nintendo where Virtual Console has persisted

2666
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:23,760
With the Wii and the Wii U

2667
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:25,760
And now eventually on the Switch

2668
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:27,760
As if somehow

2669
01:36:27,760 --> 01:36:29,760
They would have some sort of record that you made

2670
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:31,760
Those purchases

2671
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:33,760
If only they had the forethought to do that

2672
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:35,760
Too bad

2673
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:37,760
Too bad that other companies don't have

2674
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:39,760
A unified marketplace like that

2675
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:41,760
Like Sony

2676
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:43,760
Oh wait Sony

2677
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:45,760
Too bad we can't bring those

2678
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:47,760
Backwards compatibility

2679
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:49,760
The Playstation Pro is just

2680
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:51,760
Not strong enough

2681
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:53,760
To emulate something the PSP can emulate

2682
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:55,760
Anyway

2683
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:57,760
YYR says

2684
01:36:57,760 --> 01:36:59,760
The full list is

2685
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:01,760
Borderlands 2, Assassin's Creed, Rogue, King of Fighters

2686
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:03,760
2002, Gyromancer

2687
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:05,760
Moondiver and Space Invaders

2688
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:07,760
Infinity Gene

2689
01:37:07,760 --> 01:37:09,760
Which is funny cause

2690
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:11,760
Is Gyromancer that Square Enix puzzle game?

2691
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:13,760
Cause I own that one too

2692
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:15,760
And I had Moondiver so I had like three of those games

2693
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:17,760
I didn't even realize that

2694
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:19,760
I have not fired up my Xbox One games library

2695
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:21,760
Every time I've been firing that up recently

2696
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:23,760
I've just been going right into Skyrim

2697
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:25,760
Ah yes I do see them on the list now that I actually

2698
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:27,760
Cause this is a, wow

2699
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:29,760
That is one extensive list there

2700
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:31,760
Oh what of all the 360

2701
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:33,760
Of all the games that are backwards compatible

2702
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:35,760
I know, if you haven't checked your Xbox One

2703
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:37,760
In a while, like go into your games library

2704
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:39,760
And just look like in your two download list

2705
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:41,760
You might just find like

2706
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:43,760
Surprise, you've got like 12 games that you bought

2707
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:45,760
On Xbox 360 that are now backwards compatible

2708
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:47,760
That's happened to me quite a bit

2709
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:49,760
I mean, they fucking got

2710
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:51,760
Beat and groovy working on Xbox One

2711
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:53,760
Backwards compatibility

2712
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:55,760
Why did somebody waste their fucking breath

2713
01:37:55,760 --> 01:37:57,760
Even testing to see if that game loaded

2714
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:59,760
Like that's amazing

2715
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:01,760
That is amazing

2716
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:03,760
That's dedication

2717
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:05,760
Alright, anyway

2718
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:07,760
Ah hey, a follow up

2719
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:09,760
To something we talked about last week

2720
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:11,760
In the case of the

2721
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:13,760
Missing box of Super Nintendo

2722
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:15,760
Games that went missing

2723
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:17,760
I guess it was blamed for the

2724
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:19,760
Lost in transit, yeah, lost in transit

2725
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:21,760
Lost in transit, you know

2726
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:23,760
Pretty quick to blame somebody stealing it

2727
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:25,760
At the post office, because let's be real

2728
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:27,760
That's what would usually happen

2729
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:29,760
But in the interest of fairness

2730
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:31,760
And we should say

2731
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:33,760
Everything's okay, nobody stole it

2732
01:38:33,760 --> 01:38:35,760
It was recovered, that's right

2733
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:37,760
They did recover the

2734
01:38:37,760 --> 01:38:39,760
Super Nintendo games valued at $10,000

2735
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:41,760
Apparently what happened is

2736
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:43,760
They were found

2737
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:45,760
At an Atlanta, Georgia

2738
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:47,760
Mail recovery center

2739
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:49,760
So how about that, so Bobby was trying to get him redirected

2740
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:51,760
To his house, no he didn't

2741
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:53,760
I'm looking to see what I have

2742
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:55,760
Anyway, so it was at the Atlanta, Georgia

2743
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:57,760
Mail recovery center so they were able to locate the package

2744
01:38:57,760 --> 01:38:59,760
Here's the interesting thing

2745
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:01,760
Because this was

2746
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:03,760
Going around on so many news

2747
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:05,760
Outlets and everything

2748
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:07,760
Apparently it was giving the post office a bad rep

2749
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:09,760
Right, because a lot of us were jumping

2750
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:11,760
To conclusions about, oh it was stolen

2751
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:13,760
So this guy was able

2752
01:39:13,760 --> 01:39:15,760
To get through and actually get noticed

2753
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:17,760
He says in his

2754
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:19,760
Little statement on what happened

2755
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:21,760
He told me straight up the reason he was

2756
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:23,760
Contacting me was because of the news articles

2757
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:25,760
He'd encountered on the case

2758
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:27,760
So thanks to the coverage, I had a strong

2759
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:29,760
Contact within the US postal service

2760
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:31,760
Who passed me to his employee who opened the

2761
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:33,760
Investigation and then found the package

2762
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:35,760
So how about that y'all, angry gamers

2763
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:37,760
Accomplished something, angry

2764
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:39,760
Chated fucking gamers accomplished

2765
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:41,760
Something, good job

2766
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:43,760
100 Nintendo, Super Nintendo

2767
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:45,760
Games for you, that's more games than you'll

2768
01:39:45,760 --> 01:39:47,760
Find on the virtual console at launch

2769
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:49,760
For the Nintendo Switch

2770
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:51,760
I do think I have most of these

2771
01:39:51,760 --> 01:39:53,760
I love it

2772
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:55,760
Loki, fuck off but I love it

2773
01:39:55,760 --> 01:39:57,760
Maybe that's lost somewhere

2774
01:39:57,760 --> 01:39:59,760
Check Atlanta

2775
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:01,760
Check Bobby's house

2776
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:03,760
Bobby, do you have virtual console?

2777
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:05,760
Do you have virtual console in that basement?

2778
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:07,760
Is that where it went?

2779
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:09,760
Bobby Blackwolf

2780
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:11,760
In the conservatory

2781
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:13,760
With the computer hacking kit

2782
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:15,760
Alright, hey

2783
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:17,760
Steam prices are going up soon

2784
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:19,760
Okay, just kidding

2785
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:21,760
That would be the clickbait headline I would try to post

2786
01:40:21,760 --> 01:40:23,760
On Facebook, but it's not as bad as it sounds

2787
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:25,760
Because the steam prices are not going up

2788
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:27,760
In the states, so if you do come across

2789
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:29,760
An article about steam prices going up soon

2790
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:31,760
Here's what's really happening

2791
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:33,760
Yes, sales tax is now

2792
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:35,760
Included in the prices

2793
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:37,760
Across new countries

2794
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:39,760
There's new tax laws that are requiring sales tax

2795
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:41,760
Be applied to digital goods

2796
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:43,760
And services in some new countries

2797
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:45,760
Starting in March in Switzerland, South Korea

2798
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:47,760
Japan, New Zealand, Iceland

2799
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:49,760
South Africa and India

2800
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:51,760
April in Serbia, May in Taiwan

2801
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:53,760
And July in Australia

2802
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:55,760
So for example the tax in Australia is 10%

2803
01:40:55,760 --> 01:40:57,760
So in July the price of steam games

2804
01:40:57,760 --> 01:40:59,760
Will be 10% higher

2805
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:01,760
It is going to pay for this tax

2806
01:41:01,760 --> 01:41:03,760
It's not like the US where you get

2807
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:05,760
Charged tax after the advertised price

2808
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:07,760
In these countries

2809
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:09,760
For whatever reason the tax code is written

2810
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:11,760
That the tax must be included in the advertised price

2811
01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:13,760
I guess that's like

2812
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:15,760
Buying flight tickets

2813
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:17,760
Here in the US

2814
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:19,760
Now have to include all the other little taxes and things in them

2815
01:41:19,760 --> 01:41:21,760
So steam is having to do

2816
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:23,760
It's alright Australia, you're used to getting screwed over

2817
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:25,760
When it comes to pricing anyway

2818
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:27,760
It's not nice

2819
01:41:27,760 --> 01:41:29,760
It is not nice

2820
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:31,760
That's alright, wait for the sales

2821
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:33,760
Wait for those sales

2822
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:35,760
Alright, Dark Sakura, how about you?

2823
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:37,760
What do you have for us?

2824
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:39,760
Well a couple of things actually

2825
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:41,760
That make me super happy

2826
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:43,760
And one of them is a huge fuck you

2827
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:45,760
So I like that even better

2828
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:47,760
This one is the first happy news

2829
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:49,760
One of the favorite games of my household

2830
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:51,760
Actually a series I should say

2831
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:53,760
Are the Wonder Boy games

2832
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:55,760
That came out on Sega Master System

2833
01:41:55,760 --> 01:41:57,760
Well now

2834
01:41:57,760 --> 01:41:59,760
Dotemu has brought out

2835
01:41:59,760 --> 01:42:01,760
A remastered version

2836
01:42:01,760 --> 01:42:03,760
Of Wonder Boy 3 The Dragon's Trap

2837
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:05,760
And it's just going to be called

2838
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:07,760
Wonder Boy The Dragon's Trap

2839
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:09,760
It has a hand drawn style

2840
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:11,760
And

2841
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:13,760
But it's also

2842
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:17,760
Got the music

2843
01:42:17,760 --> 01:42:19,760
And you can swap

2844
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:21,760
Between the new

2845
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:23,760
Hand drawn style

2846
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:25,760
And the original style

2847
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:27,760
So that's really awesome

2848
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:29,760
There is a whole

2849
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:31,760
Trailer up and I would suggest

2850
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:33,760
That people check it out, it's really sweet

2851
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:35,760
Um

2852
01:42:35,760 --> 01:42:37,760
Next is something

2853
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:39,760
That

2854
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:41,760
I have to bask in this

2855
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:43,760
For a minute

2856
01:42:43,760 --> 01:42:45,760
Humble Bundle, which by the way

2857
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:47,760
I sent you a message on a bundle

2858
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:49,760
I actually knew about this bundle

2859
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:51,760
And I'll tell the listeners about it

2860
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:53,760
Because it's the Humble Civilization Bundle

2861
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:55,760
This isn't what Dark Sakura was going to talk about

2862
01:42:55,760 --> 01:42:57,760
But their newest bundle is the Humble Civilization Bundle

2863
01:42:57,760 --> 01:42:59,760
And if I remember right off the top of my head

2864
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:01,760
You can pay a dollar

2865
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:03,760
For a dollar

2866
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:05,760
For a dollar

2867
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:07,760
You guys, if you don't own

2868
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:09,760
Now look, Civilization 3 is actually my least

2869
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:11,760
Favorite in the entire series, I'm going to be honest

2870
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:13,760
But Civ 4 is one of the best

2871
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:15,760
So like if you can't be bothered

2872
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:17,760
To pay one dollar

2873
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:19,760
For Civilization 4

2874
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:21,760
Literally, I can't

2875
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:23,760
With you

2876
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:25,760
But you have to also be a fan

2877
01:43:25,760 --> 01:43:27,760
Of those types of games

2878
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:29,760
Not for a dollar, you don't really have to be a fan

2879
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:31,760
If you've got a fixed income

2880
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:33,760
Type of thing going on, look, I'm not going to

2881
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:35,760
Break you too bad, but look, seriously, if you have the room

2882
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:37,760
In your budget to forgo a soda

2883
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:39,760
And buy the Civilization

2884
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:41,760
Humble Bundle instead

2885
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:43,760
I would encourage you to do so

2886
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:45,760
As Dark Sakura takes

2887
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:47,760
A big swig of her Diet Pepsi

2888
01:43:47,760 --> 01:43:49,760
That she probably paid a dollar fifty for at the store

2889
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:51,760
And says, I don't have time for Civ 4

2890
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:53,760
Actually, it tastes pretty awful

2891
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:55,760
That's blood water, okay

2892
01:43:55,760 --> 01:43:57,760
Actually, it tastes like it

2893
01:43:57,760 --> 01:43:59,760
Thanks to my nose, but still

2894
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:01,760
But my good news

2895
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:03,760
The Humble Freedom Bundle

2896
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:05,760
Raised

2897
01:44:05,760 --> 01:44:07,760
6.73 million

2898
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:09,760
To aid

2899
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:11,760
Immigrants

2900
01:44:11,760 --> 01:44:13,760
In response to

2901
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:15,760
The new Voldemort

2902
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:17,760
Immigration ban

2903
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:21,760
You know what, I don't even want to call him Voldemort

2904
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:23,760
Because he's fucking orange

2905
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:25,760
In response to what happened

2906
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:27,760
I'm just going to call him the dump

2907
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:29,760
I'm just going to call him the dump

2908
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:31,760
Because he's a human garbage dump

2909
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:33,760
Anyway

2910
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:35,760
The proceeds are going to charities like

2911
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:37,760
The ACLU, the American Civil Liberties

2912
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:39,760
Union, the International Rescue

2913
01:44:39,760 --> 01:44:41,760
Committees, and Doctors Without

2914
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:43,760
Borders

2915
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:45,760
Basically, it offered

2916
01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:47,760
Over $600

2917
01:44:47,760 --> 01:44:49,760
Worth of gains for $30

2918
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:51,760
Including some pretty

2919
01:44:51,760 --> 01:44:53,760
Big ones like The Witness

2920
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:55,760
And they also

2921
01:44:55,760 --> 01:44:57,760
Said that they would match

2922
01:44:57,760 --> 01:44:59,760
Up to $300,000

2923
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:01,760
Of the proceeds

2924
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:03,760
Totally, that's up to

2925
01:45:03,760 --> 01:45:05,760
6

2926
01:45:05,760 --> 01:45:07,760
.73 million

2927
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:09,760
They did

2928
01:45:09,760 --> 01:45:11,760
Some of the games finally started running out

2929
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:13,760
Because I'm sure some of the game makers

2930
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:15,760
Hey, I think it's awesome that even the

2931
01:45:15,760 --> 01:45:17,760
Creator of Stardew Valley

2932
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:19,760
That game is hot shit right now in the indie scene

2933
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:21,760
And in the gaming scene in general

2934
01:45:21,760 --> 01:45:23,760
It's awesome that that guy would contribute

2935
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:25,760
200,000 copies of his game

2936
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:27,760
To this cause, but the reality is

2937
01:45:27,760 --> 01:45:29,760
He had set a number

2938
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:31,760
And once they exceeded that number those keys were gone

2939
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:33,760
So in the final hours

2940
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:35,760
I think once they broke it was either

2941
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:37,760
200,000 or 250,000, sorry I don't remember

2942
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:39,760
The number, but some of the games

2943
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:41,760
A good chunk of them kind of fell off the list

2944
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:43,760
Like Stardew Valley I know is probably the biggest name

2945
01:45:43,760 --> 01:45:45,760
That no longer became available

2946
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:47,760
At that point, but again

2947
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:49,760
That's not a read because that's awesome

2948
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:51,760
But a game like that

2949
01:45:51,760 --> 01:45:53,760
That's still hot shit

2950
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:55,760
Getting $15 a copy is donated to a cause

2951
01:45:55,760 --> 01:45:57,760
Like this at all

2952
01:45:57,760 --> 01:45:59,760
Even more if you look at the number of keys that were available

2953
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:01,760
Think of how many people

2954
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:03,760
That was

2955
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:05,760
Who gave a

2956
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:07,760
Fuck you

2957
01:46:07,760 --> 01:46:09,760
To the establishment

2958
01:46:09,760 --> 01:46:11,760
Or just wanted to play some games

2959
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:13,760
But still

2960
01:46:13,760 --> 01:46:15,760
It was a big fuck you

2961
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:17,760
And I am so proud of them for doing this

2962
01:46:17,760 --> 01:46:23,760
Moving on

2963
01:46:23,760 --> 01:46:25,760
Alright that's it for our rapid fire news

2964
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:27,760
So let's talk about

2965
01:46:27,760 --> 01:46:29,760
What is coming out in stores this week

2966
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:31,760
Loki, gee what could possibly be coming out in the US this Friday

2967
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:33,760
Horizon Zero Dawn

2968
01:46:33,760 --> 01:46:35,760
That's right

2969
01:46:35,760 --> 01:46:37,760
That's a big deal too

2970
01:46:37,760 --> 01:46:39,760
That is a big deal

2971
01:46:39,760 --> 01:46:41,760
Torment, Tides of Numeric

2972
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:43,760
Isn't Horizon getting pretty good reviews too?

2973
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:45,760
It is

2974
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:47,760
I didn't have my eyes on it

2975
01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:49,760
Until I started to hear about some of these reviews

2976
01:46:49,760 --> 01:46:51,760
I don't always listen to reviewers

2977
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:53,760
But when the feedback is uniformly positive

2978
01:46:53,760 --> 01:46:55,760
Like it is for this game

2979
01:46:55,760 --> 01:46:57,760
Or majority positive

2980
01:46:57,760 --> 01:46:59,760
Like it is for this game

2981
01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:01,760
Or like that movie

2982
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:03,760
That has 100% of Rotten Tomatoes right now

2983
01:47:03,760 --> 01:47:05,760
That Get Out

2984
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:07,760
Has 100% of Rotten Tomatoes right now

2985
01:47:07,760 --> 01:47:09,760
That definitely grabbed my attention

2986
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:11,760
Like oh maybe this is something I should be paying attention to

2987
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:13,760
And go see

2988
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:15,760
Same thing kind of happens with video games

2989
01:47:15,760 --> 01:47:17,760
Yeah

2990
01:47:17,760 --> 01:47:21,760
So we had a game called Torment, Tides of Numeric

2991
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:23,760
And that's on PC, Playstation 4 and Xbox One

2992
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:27,760
Constructor HD on PC, Playstation 4 and Xbox One

2993
01:47:27,760 --> 01:47:31,760
Musou Stars on Playstation 4 and the Vita

2994
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:33,760
And then of course a whole bunch of shit on the Nintendo Switch

2995
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:35,760
So of course we have

2996
01:47:35,760 --> 01:47:37,760
1-2 Switch

2997
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:39,760
I am Setsuna

2998
01:47:39,760 --> 01:47:41,760
Just Dance 2017

2999
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:43,760
Human Resource Machine

3000
01:47:43,760 --> 01:47:45,760
Little Inferno, Skylanders

3001
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:47,760
Imaginators, The Binding of Isaac

3002
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:49,760
Afterbirth Plus

3003
01:47:49,760 --> 01:47:51,760
Super Bomberman R

3004
01:47:51,760 --> 01:47:53,760
All those on the Switch

3005
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:55,760
Legend of Zelda, Breath of the Wild on the Switch

3006
01:47:55,760 --> 01:47:57,760
Wii U, World of Goo

3007
01:47:57,760 --> 01:47:59,760
On the Switch

3008
01:47:59,760 --> 01:48:01,760
And that would be your lineup right there

3009
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:03,760
World of Goo, yes

3010
01:48:03,760 --> 01:48:05,760
That's not an old game

3011
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:07,760
Does that game date back to the Nintendo Wii?

3012
01:48:07,760 --> 01:48:09,760
I think it does

3013
01:48:09,760 --> 01:48:11,760
It's an old game

3014
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:13,760
It's like one of the first WiiWare games

3015
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:15,760
Back when it was called WiiWare

3016
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:18,760
Alright so moving on to Japan

3017
01:48:18,760 --> 01:48:20,760
And checking out what's in Japan this week

3018
01:48:20,760 --> 01:48:22,760
Horizon Zero Dawn gets its release on March 2nd

3019
01:48:22,760 --> 01:48:25,760
As well as Winning Post 8 2017

3020
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:27,760
Ironically enough Loki

3021
01:48:27,760 --> 01:48:31,760
Borderlands, the double deluxe collection

3022
01:48:31,760 --> 01:48:33,760
What they're calling it in Japan

3023
01:48:33,760 --> 01:48:36,760
I think this might be a price reduction though

3024
01:48:36,760 --> 01:48:38,760
I don't think this is the initial release of the game

3025
01:48:38,760 --> 01:48:40,760
This is funny that we were talking about it before

3026
01:48:40,760 --> 01:48:42,760
And it's called the double deluxe collection

3027
01:48:42,760 --> 01:48:44,760
And it's very clear on the box

3028
01:48:44,760 --> 01:48:46,760
Borderlands the pre-sequel and Borderlands 2

3029
01:48:46,760 --> 01:48:48,760
Are on that

3030
01:48:48,760 --> 01:48:50,760
And that is on the Playstation 4 this week

3031
01:48:50,760 --> 01:48:52,760
Let's see traveling over to the Vita

3032
01:48:52,760 --> 01:48:56,760
Playstation Vita only has Winning Post 8 2017 this week

3033
01:48:56,760 --> 01:48:58,760
Otherwise the Vita kind of has a week off

3034
01:48:58,760 --> 01:49:00,760
Which believe it or not

3035
01:49:00,760 --> 01:49:02,760
Yes they usually have stuff going on

3036
01:49:02,760 --> 01:49:04,760
In Japan

3037
01:49:04,760 --> 01:49:06,760
Nintendo 3DS has a release this week

3038
01:49:06,760 --> 01:49:08,760
It's a Doraemon game

3039
01:49:08,760 --> 01:49:10,760
Doraemon Nobita no Nan Kyoku

3040
01:49:10,760 --> 01:49:12,760
Kachi Kachi Daibuken

3041
01:49:12,760 --> 01:49:14,760

3047
01:49:24,760 --> 01:49:26,760
That's what they're wearing

3048
01:49:26,760 --> 01:49:28,760
I love Doraemon he's so cute

01:51:32,760 --> 01:51:34,760
Yo, for the Switch

3112
01:51:34,760 --> 01:51:36,760
I'm gonna go hide in my room

3113
01:51:36,760 --> 01:51:38,760
And raid until Mass Effect

3114
01:51:38,760 --> 01:51:40,760
Andromeda comes out

3115
01:51:40,760 --> 01:51:42,760
Sounds like a plan, addict

3116
01:51:42,760 --> 01:51:44,760
Hey, you're the enabler

3117
01:51:44,760 --> 01:51:46,760
Dealer

3118
01:51:46,760 --> 01:51:48,760
Alright, let's go

3119
01:51:48,760 --> 01:51:50,760
To the mailbag

3120
01:51:50,760 --> 01:51:52,760
Every week you guys send us emails

3121
01:51:52,760 --> 01:51:54,760
Participate at

3122
01:51:54,760 --> 01:51:56,760
DarkSockersLoungeRadio.com

3123
01:51:56,760 --> 01:51:58,760
Is where you can send us emails

3124
01:51:58,760 --> 01:52:00,760
And when those emails come in, DarkSocker dives in the mailbag

3125
01:52:00,760 --> 01:52:02,760
Headfirst and reads your emails here

3126
01:52:02,760 --> 01:52:04,760
Live on air

3127
01:52:04,760 --> 01:52:06,760
So DarkSocker's gonna jump into the mailbag right now

3128
01:52:06,760 --> 01:52:08,760
And pull out

3129
01:52:08,760 --> 01:52:10,760
Jack shit

3130
01:52:10,760 --> 01:52:12,760
Empty mailbag

3131
01:52:12,760 --> 01:52:14,760
Not even a crusty poop

3132
01:52:14,760 --> 01:52:16,760
Why would you say that?

3133
01:52:16,760 --> 01:52:18,760
Because I'm a little high on cough medicine

3134
01:52:18,760 --> 01:52:20,760
Right now

3135
01:52:20,760 --> 01:52:22,760
Okay, I accept that excuse

3136
01:52:22,760 --> 01:52:24,760
Anyhow, there is no emails

3137
01:52:24,760 --> 01:52:26,760
For DarkSocker to read this week

3138
01:52:26,760 --> 01:52:28,760
And that makes her a sad panda

3139
01:52:28,760 --> 01:52:30,760
Actually, it probably doesn't since she is still kinda sick

3140
01:52:30,760 --> 01:52:32,760
She probably appreciates you all giving her voice a break

3141
01:52:32,760 --> 01:52:34,760
I'm gonna just assume

3142
01:52:34,760 --> 01:52:36,760
You all knew

3143
01:52:36,760 --> 01:52:38,760
But for next week, you can email us

3144
01:52:38,760 --> 01:52:40,760
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

3145
01:52:40,760 --> 01:52:42,760
Guess we'll have to go back to some news

3146
01:52:42,760 --> 01:52:44,760
Won't we, Loki?

3147
01:52:44,760 --> 01:52:46,760
Yep, and all the things old are new again

3148
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:48,760
343Industry says

3149
01:52:48,760 --> 01:52:50,760
Promise? Hey, guess what?

3150
01:52:50,760 --> 01:52:52,760
We were briefed with Halo 5 by

3151
01:52:52,760 --> 01:52:54,760
Taking out split screen play

3152
01:52:54,760 --> 01:52:56,760
But that's not gonna be a problem going forward

3153
01:52:56,760 --> 01:52:58,760
We're going to go ahead

3154
01:52:58,760 --> 01:53:00,760
And make sure that's included

3155
01:53:00,760 --> 01:53:02,760
In all future releases

3156
01:53:02,760 --> 01:53:04,760
Because it was incredibly painful

3157
01:53:04,760 --> 01:53:06,760
For the community and us

3158
01:53:06,760 --> 01:53:08,760
That we didn't include it in Halo 5

3159
01:53:10,760 --> 01:53:12,760
So that's pretty nice

3160
01:53:12,760 --> 01:53:14,760
That'll be available

3161
01:53:14,760 --> 01:53:16,760
That's a staple, so why not?

3162
01:53:16,760 --> 01:53:18,760
Alright, so

3163
01:53:18,760 --> 01:53:20,760
Nice, I don't know

3164
01:53:20,760 --> 01:53:22,760
I guess I was kind of past it

3165
01:53:22,760 --> 01:53:24,760
At this point, but I'm excited

3166
01:53:24,760 --> 01:53:26,760
I guess a little bit to see it coming back

3167
01:53:26,760 --> 01:53:28,760
Because my first introduction to the Halo series

3168
01:53:28,760 --> 01:53:30,760
Was a split screen Halo thing

3169
01:53:30,760 --> 01:53:32,760
A local area network

3170
01:53:32,760 --> 01:53:34,760
I'm sure I've told this story on the show many times before

3171
01:53:34,760 --> 01:53:36,760
But it was actually at a wedding reception

3172
01:53:36,760 --> 01:53:38,760
My friend had a Halo themed wedding

3173
01:53:38,760 --> 01:53:40,760
And they actually had Halo playable

3174
01:53:40,760 --> 01:53:42,760
At the reception

3175
01:53:42,760 --> 01:53:44,760
And that was my first introduction to it

3176
01:53:44,760 --> 01:53:46,760
And it was awesome

3177
01:53:46,760 --> 01:53:48,760
It really sold me on the original Xbox

3178
01:53:48,760 --> 01:53:50,760
We go back to what we were talking about earlier in the show

3179
01:53:50,760 --> 01:53:52,760
So the split screen stuff, that's pretty cool

3180
01:53:52,760 --> 01:53:54,760
So I'm happy to hear it's coming back

3181
01:53:54,760 --> 01:53:56,760
I think that'll be a lot of fun

3182
01:53:56,760 --> 01:53:58,760
Alright

3183
01:53:58,760 --> 01:54:00,760
Well, in news of That's Awkward

3184
01:54:00,760 --> 01:54:02,760
This week

3185
01:54:02,760 --> 01:54:04,760
And where does all the awkward stuff happen?

3186
01:54:04,760 --> 01:54:06,760
Live streams, right?

3187
01:54:06,760 --> 01:54:08,760
So anyway, there was a live stream this week

3188
01:54:08,760 --> 01:54:10,760
Which is captured forever, thanks to YouTube

3189
01:54:10,760 --> 01:54:12,760
Where

3190
01:54:12,760 --> 01:54:14,760
I'm probably gonna say this name wrong, I'm sorry

3191
01:54:14,760 --> 01:54:16,760
I just don't follow a lot of the streamer celebrities

3192
01:54:16,760 --> 01:54:18,760
Really

3193
01:54:18,760 --> 01:54:20,760
But Kefri, I think is the name of the streamer

3194
01:54:20,760 --> 01:54:22,760
He's an Overwatch player

3195
01:54:22,760 --> 01:54:24,760
Plays a lot of competitive Overwatch

3196
01:54:24,760 --> 01:54:26,760
Plays so much competitive Overwatch

3197
01:54:26,760 --> 01:54:28,760
He happens to be the highest ranked Widowmaker player in the world

3198
01:54:28,760 --> 01:54:30,760
And Widowmaker is one of those

3199
01:54:30,760 --> 01:54:32,760
As I call her when I'm playing the game

3200
01:54:32,760 --> 01:54:34,760
Bitch snipers

3201
01:54:34,760 --> 01:54:36,760
Because when I get sniped

3202
01:54:36,760 --> 01:54:38,760
From across the map

3203
01:54:38,760 --> 01:54:40,760
I tend to yell out, that bitch sniper killed me

3204
01:54:40,760 --> 01:54:42,760
So, yeah

3205
01:54:42,760 --> 01:54:44,760
But I also do like playing Widowmaker a lot

3206
01:54:44,760 --> 01:54:46,760
Because sometimes it's really fun to be the bitch sniper

3207
01:54:46,760 --> 01:54:48,760
So anyway

3208
01:54:48,760 --> 01:54:50,760
Kefri is

3209
01:54:50,760 --> 01:54:52,760
The highest ranked bitch sniper in the whole world

3210
01:54:52,760 --> 01:54:54,760
And this was interesting

3211
01:54:54,760 --> 01:54:56,760
Because what happened is that he was actually

3212
01:54:56,760 --> 01:54:58,760
Playing the stream and doing some ranked matches

3213
01:54:58,760 --> 01:55:00,760
And came across

3214
01:55:00,760 --> 01:55:02,760
Somebody impersonating his gamer tag

3215
01:55:02,760 --> 01:55:04,760
So had the exact same name

3216
01:55:04,760 --> 01:55:06,760
In the game

3217
01:55:06,760 --> 01:55:08,760
Also playing Widowmaker

3218
01:55:08,760 --> 01:55:10,760
But as they were playing the match on Twitch

3219
01:55:10,760 --> 01:55:12,760
They figured, oh this guy is using an aimbot

3220
01:55:12,760 --> 01:55:14,760
He's cheating

3221
01:55:14,760 --> 01:55:16,760
He's doing these shots you can't even do

3222
01:55:16,760 --> 01:55:18,760
With a normal machine

3223
01:55:18,760 --> 01:55:20,760
Basically

3224
01:55:20,760 --> 01:55:22,760
Guess what?

3225
01:55:22,760 --> 01:55:24,760
The real player ended up winning anyway

3226
01:55:24,760 --> 01:55:26,760
So

3227
01:55:26,760 --> 01:55:28,760
Even when the guy was cheating

3228
01:55:28,760 --> 01:55:30,760
He couldn't beat the team

3229
01:55:30,760 --> 01:55:32,760
And what's really hilarious about this is you know how

3230
01:55:32,760 --> 01:55:34,760
One of the big things in Overwatch that's pretty awesome

3231
01:55:34,760 --> 01:55:36,760
Is that you always get to see play of the game

3232
01:55:36,760 --> 01:55:38,760
Which has become this whole meme online

3233
01:55:38,760 --> 01:55:40,760
So guess who got play of the game?

3234
01:55:40,760 --> 01:55:42,760
The real one and he even typed in chat

3235
01:55:42,760 --> 01:55:44,760
I think at the end when all is said and done

3236
01:55:44,760 --> 01:55:46,760
He said, can't even beat me with hacks bud

3237
01:55:46,760 --> 01:55:48,760
Laughs

3238
01:55:48,760 --> 01:55:50,760
You gotta love

3239
01:55:50,760 --> 01:55:52,760
Yes, you gotta love it

3240
01:55:52,760 --> 01:55:54,760
Usually that level of douchey snark

3241
01:55:54,760 --> 01:55:56,760
I'm like, I don't like that stuff

3242
01:55:56,760 --> 01:55:58,760
In the competitive scene but in this case

3243
01:55:58,760 --> 01:56:00,760
It is completely and utterly warranted

3244
01:56:00,760 --> 01:56:02,760
Fuck cheaters in online games

3245
01:56:02,760 --> 01:56:04,760
Fuck them with something hard and sandpapery

3246
01:56:04,760 --> 01:56:06,760
So this guy got what's coming to him

3247
01:56:06,760 --> 01:56:08,760
Embarrassed on video, it's just a bummer

3248
01:56:08,760 --> 01:56:10,760
We couldn't see what this guy's real

3249
01:56:10,760 --> 01:56:12,760
Gamer tag was

3250
01:56:12,760 --> 01:56:14,760
But in other words, if you're gonna go

3251
01:56:14,760 --> 01:56:16,760
Fake, then

3252
01:56:16,760 --> 01:56:18,760
You're probably gonna get beat

3253
01:56:18,760 --> 01:56:20,760
Kaijuto in chat says, bleh

3254
01:56:20,760 --> 01:56:22,760
The cheating I don't agree with

3255
01:56:22,760 --> 01:56:24,760
But a screen name is a screen name

3256
01:56:24,760 --> 01:56:26,760
There could be a hundred Kaijutos, I don't give a fuck

3257
01:56:28,760 --> 01:56:30,760
Yes and no

3258
01:56:30,760 --> 01:56:32,760
Certainly there's other people out there that must call themselves

3259
01:56:32,760 --> 01:56:34,760
Skye because I never get the name on websites

3260
01:56:34,760 --> 01:56:36,760
Which I actually usually don't try to take that name anymore

3261
01:56:36,760 --> 01:56:38,760
I try to get Rob Roberts wherever I can

3262
01:56:38,760 --> 01:56:40,760
But I digress

3263
01:56:40,760 --> 01:56:42,760
The fact is

3264
01:56:42,760 --> 01:56:44,760
That he's taking the name

3265
01:56:44,760 --> 01:56:46,760
And playing Widowmaker

3266
01:56:46,760 --> 01:56:48,760
And cheating while he's doing it

3267
01:56:48,760 --> 01:56:50,760
Which could be

3268
01:56:50,760 --> 01:56:52,760
Giving the impression that when

3269
01:56:52,760 --> 01:56:54,760
Other people play against him

3270
01:56:54,760 --> 01:56:56,760
It's the real guy

3271
01:56:56,760 --> 01:56:58,760
Even though it's a cheater

3272
01:56:58,760 --> 01:57:00,760
Does that make sense at all?

3273
01:57:00,760 --> 01:57:02,760
So maybe what Blizzard needs to do

3274
01:57:02,760 --> 01:57:04,760
And I think they actually do do this

3275
01:57:04,760 --> 01:57:06,760
If you mouse over the gamer tag or something

3276
01:57:06,760 --> 01:57:08,760
You get to see the numbers that are following the gamer tag

3277
01:57:08,760 --> 01:57:10,760
So you can tell if it's the right

3278
01:57:10,760 --> 01:57:12,760
One or not

3279
01:57:12,760 --> 01:57:14,760
I don't know if the professionals numbers are out there for everybody to find

3280
01:57:14,760 --> 01:57:16,760
But

3281
01:57:16,760 --> 01:57:18,760
I kinda think intent is a big part of it

3282
01:57:18,760 --> 01:57:20,760
And when you're using these cheating bots and so forth

3283
01:57:20,760 --> 01:57:22,760
To play the same character

3284
01:57:22,760 --> 01:57:24,760
That the hacker does with skill

3285
01:57:24,760 --> 01:57:26,760
Even though apparently

3286
01:57:26,760 --> 01:57:28,760
He's not skilled even with the hacking tool

3287
01:57:28,760 --> 01:57:30,760
I think that's kinda shitty

3288
01:57:30,760 --> 01:57:32,760
That's the whole thing

3289
01:57:32,760 --> 01:57:34,760
When it's like impersonation with the intent to impersonate

3290
01:57:34,760 --> 01:57:36,760
If it's the fact that

3291
01:57:36,760 --> 01:57:38,760
Oh I've been using this name for years online too

3292
01:57:38,760 --> 01:57:40,760
Well then that I understand

3293
01:57:40,760 --> 01:57:42,760
I think I went on Twitter

3294
01:57:42,760 --> 01:57:44,760
To try to find

3295
01:57:44,760 --> 01:57:46,760
I want the name Rob Roberts on Twitter

3296
01:57:46,760 --> 01:57:48,760
And it belongs to a spam account

3297
01:57:48,760 --> 01:57:50,760
But when you search for that name

3298
01:57:50,760 --> 01:57:52,760
You get these other Rob Roberts that come up

3299
01:57:52,760 --> 01:57:54,760
And I think one is like a DJ in Australia or something

3300
01:57:54,760 --> 01:57:56,760
I can't be mad at that guy

3301
01:57:56,760 --> 01:57:58,760
That just happens to be his name too

3302
01:57:58,760 --> 01:58:00,760
I'm not mad at that guy

3303
01:58:00,760 --> 01:58:02,760
I'm mad that a spammer took the name Rob Roberts

3304
01:58:02,760 --> 01:58:04,760
But if this other DJ had the name

3305
01:58:04,760 --> 01:58:06,760
Then I really couldn't be upset

3306
01:58:06,760 --> 01:58:08,760
Because it's his professional name too

3307
01:58:08,760 --> 01:58:10,760
In a different way

3308
01:58:10,760 --> 01:58:12,760
Anyway

3309
01:58:12,760 --> 01:58:14,760
Alright let's move on

3310
01:58:14,760 --> 01:58:16,760
DarkSakura

3311
01:58:16,760 --> 01:58:20,760
Well we are losing one of the writers for Portal

3312
01:58:20,760 --> 01:58:22,760
Very very sad

3313
01:58:22,760 --> 01:58:24,760
But necessary I'm sure he thinks

3314
01:58:24,760 --> 01:58:26,760
That it is

3315
01:58:26,760 --> 01:58:28,760
Paul who has been with Valve since 2004

3316
01:58:28,760 --> 01:58:30,760
Worked on Half Life 2 Episode 1

3317
01:58:30,760 --> 01:58:32,760
Both the Portal games

3318
01:58:32,760 --> 01:58:34,760
Left 4 Dead

3319
01:58:34,760 --> 01:58:36,760
Has just left the company

3320
01:58:38,760 --> 01:58:40,760
He didn't say anything about what's up next

3321
01:58:40,760 --> 01:58:42,760
But he was working with Double Fine

3322
01:58:42,760 --> 01:58:44,760
On Psychonauts 2

3323
01:58:44,760 --> 01:58:46,760
So maybe it's to spend more time on that

3324
01:58:46,760 --> 01:58:48,760
Only can speculate

3325
01:58:48,760 --> 01:58:50,760
But

3326
01:58:50,760 --> 01:58:52,760
Good luck and go get him

3327
01:58:52,760 --> 01:58:54,760
Go get him

3328
01:58:54,760 --> 01:58:56,760
Yeah

3329
01:58:56,760 --> 01:58:58,760
Hopefully he already finished the script for Portal 3

3330
01:58:58,760 --> 01:59:00,760
On his way out

3331
01:59:00,760 --> 01:59:02,760
Valve can't count to three

3332
01:59:02,760 --> 01:59:04,760
I'm not gonna hold my breath

3333
01:59:04,760 --> 01:59:06,760
We'll see

3334
01:59:06,760 --> 01:59:08,760
But these comings and goings happen

3335
01:59:08,760 --> 01:59:10,760
And series can still be strong

3336
01:59:10,760 --> 01:59:12,760
Casey Hudson left BioWare

3337
01:59:12,760 --> 01:59:14,760
And now Mass Effect is being done by other people

3338
01:59:14,760 --> 01:59:16,760
Which

3339
01:59:16,760 --> 01:59:18,760
We won't really know if the story

3340
01:59:18,760 --> 01:59:20,760
Is still good until Mass Effect Andromeda

3341
01:59:20,760 --> 01:59:22,760
Is out we get a chance to play it

3342
01:59:22,760 --> 01:59:24,760
But we're hopeful

3343
01:59:24,760 --> 01:59:26,760
Did you see the voice list?

3344
01:59:26,760 --> 01:59:28,760
I did and I also saw the

3345
01:59:28,760 --> 01:59:30,760
Andromeda t-shirt that was on sale

3346
01:59:30,760 --> 01:59:32,760
At Gamestop when I was at the mall

3347
01:59:32,760 --> 01:59:34,760
So I was like oh the merchandise is out already

3348
01:59:34,760 --> 01:59:36,760
I was also listening to

3349
01:59:36,760 --> 01:59:38,760
Some of Natalie Dormer

3350
01:59:38,760 --> 01:59:40,760
I heard the little interview with her

3351
01:59:40,760 --> 01:59:42,760
It was pretty neat

3352
01:59:42,760 --> 01:59:44,760
Very excited for the game to come out

3353
01:59:44,760 --> 01:59:46,760
I can't wait to fuck all the aliens

3354
01:59:46,760 --> 01:59:48,760
Alright moving on

3355
01:59:48,760 --> 01:59:50,760
Loki

3356
01:59:50,760 --> 01:59:52,760
The question is is Natalie Dormer one of the aliens

3357
01:59:52,760 --> 01:59:54,760
He can fuck because you know

3358
01:59:54,760 --> 01:59:56,760
She's the doctor

3359
01:59:56,760 --> 01:59:58,760
Oh she's the chakwas replacement

3360
01:59:58,760 --> 02:00:00,760
Yes she is the asari doctor

3361
02:00:00,760 --> 02:00:02,760
I don't need to know what the profession is

3362
02:00:02,760 --> 02:00:04,760
That's not really important

3363
02:00:04,760 --> 02:00:06,760
No this is important because Dr. Chakwas is like

3364
02:00:06,760 --> 02:00:08,760
She's mom

3365
02:00:08,760 --> 02:00:10,760
She is the den mother mom of the Normandy

3366
02:00:10,760 --> 02:00:12,760
She's very much like you know

3367
02:00:12,760 --> 02:00:14,760
Like Kathleen Turner

3368
02:00:14,760 --> 02:00:16,760
Like you know

3369
02:00:16,760 --> 02:00:18,760
Why don't you come into my office and we'll

3370
02:00:18,760 --> 02:00:20,760
Drink a glass of champagne

3371
02:00:20,760 --> 02:00:22,760
So uh

3372
02:00:22,760 --> 02:00:24,760
The doctor is a pretty big role

3373
02:00:24,760 --> 02:00:26,760
Alright

3374
02:00:26,760 --> 02:00:28,760
Well um

3375
02:00:28,760 --> 02:00:30,760
Let's talk a little bit about

3376
02:00:30,760 --> 02:00:32,760
Esports I guess so

3377
02:00:32,760 --> 02:00:34,760
One thing

3378
02:00:34,760 --> 02:00:36,760
Is coming to TV pretty soon

3379
02:00:36,760 --> 02:00:38,760
In the weirdest locations I guess

3380
02:00:38,760 --> 02:00:40,760
The CW network

3381
02:00:40,760 --> 02:00:42,760
Yes that's who you think of

3382
02:00:42,760 --> 02:00:44,760
They're going to be broadcasting

3383
02:00:44,760 --> 02:00:46,760
I guess a tournament for

3384
02:00:46,760 --> 02:00:48,760
H1Z1 king of the kill

3385
02:00:48,760 --> 02:00:50,760
And so with that

3386
02:00:50,760 --> 02:00:52,760
Along with the actual broadcast

3387
02:00:52,760 --> 02:00:54,760
Which is supposed to air April 20th

3388
02:00:54,760 --> 02:00:56,760
At 9pm eastern time

3389
02:00:56,760 --> 02:00:58,760
They're going to be doing also a 5 part documentary

3390
02:00:58,760 --> 02:01:00,760
Series leading up to the tournament

3391
02:01:00,760 --> 02:01:02,760
And it's going to follow the um

3392
02:01:02,760 --> 02:01:04,760
Prematch preparations

3393
02:01:04,760 --> 02:01:06,760
Of Echo Fox

3394
02:01:06,760 --> 02:01:08,760
The um professional esports team

3395
02:01:08,760 --> 02:01:10,760
They got rid of top model for that

3396
02:01:10,760 --> 02:01:12,760
What the fuck

3397
02:01:12,760 --> 02:01:14,760
I've actually watched

3398
02:01:14,760 --> 02:01:16,760
A little bit of king of the kill

3399
02:01:16,760 --> 02:01:18,760
It's actually pretty interesting

3400
02:01:18,760 --> 02:01:20,760
Since I'm sure you guys are probably not familiar with it

3401
02:01:20,760 --> 02:01:22,760
It's basically like DayZ

3402
02:01:22,760 --> 02:01:24,760
But put into um

3403
02:01:24,760 --> 02:01:26,760
It almost like gets a little bit like

3404
02:01:26,760 --> 02:01:28,760
Um

3405
02:01:28,760 --> 02:01:30,760
Um

3406
02:01:30,760 --> 02:01:32,760
Not the Hunger Games

3407
02:01:32,760 --> 02:01:34,760
Sort of like the Hunger Games I guess

3408
02:01:34,760 --> 02:01:36,760
So basically you're in this environment

3409
02:01:36,760 --> 02:01:38,760
You land and you have to find your guns

3410
02:01:38,760 --> 02:01:40,760
And then there's like gas coming in

3411
02:01:40,760 --> 02:01:42,760
As well and it keeps making the

3412
02:01:42,760 --> 02:01:44,760
Arena smaller and smaller and smaller

3413
02:01:44,760 --> 02:01:46,760
So they're setting it up they're going to have

3414
02:01:46,760 --> 02:01:48,760
5 man teams

3415
02:01:48,760 --> 02:01:50,760
And there's 15 teams of 5 players

3416
02:01:50,760 --> 02:01:52,760
And then there's also supposed to be I guess another um

3417
02:01:52,760 --> 02:01:54,760
You know some open slots for

3418
02:01:54,760 --> 02:01:56,760
Individual people as well

3419
02:01:56,760 --> 02:01:58,760
But it's a lot of people that start off

3420
02:01:58,760 --> 02:02:00,760
In the game

3421
02:02:00,760 --> 02:02:02,760
I don't know it was entertaining why I watched it

3422
02:02:02,760 --> 02:02:04,760
I'll have to check it out

3423
02:02:04,760 --> 02:02:06,760
Is this a regular thing on Twitch

3424
02:02:06,760 --> 02:02:08,760
I assume that people are playing?

3425
02:02:08,760 --> 02:02:10,760
Yes it's one of the bigger games it's on Twitch right now

3426
02:02:10,760 --> 02:02:12,760
Okay awesome I'll have to check that out

3427
02:02:12,760 --> 02:02:14,760
I can take a break from Conan Exile streams

3428
02:02:14,760 --> 02:02:16,760
Check that out

3429
02:02:16,760 --> 02:02:18,760
So is that just all penis flailing to me?

3430
02:02:18,760 --> 02:02:20,760
Yes never gets old

3431
02:02:20,760 --> 02:02:22,760
Actually that game has died down in popularity a lot

3432
02:02:22,760 --> 02:02:24,760
I think finally everybody is like alright it's a penis

3433
02:02:24,760 --> 02:02:26,760
We get it

3434
02:02:26,760 --> 02:02:28,760
I think Conan Exile streams have died down

3435
02:02:28,760 --> 02:02:30,760
A little bit in popularity

3436
02:02:30,760 --> 02:02:32,760
Has Conan played Conan Exiles because

3437
02:02:32,760 --> 02:02:34,760
I don't know

3438
02:02:34,760 --> 02:02:36,760
Well he's gonna have that series soon

3439
02:02:36,760 --> 02:02:38,760
The clueless gamer

3440
02:02:38,760 --> 02:02:40,760
Or whatever he calls it

3441
02:02:40,760 --> 02:02:42,760
Is that on the CW?

3442
02:02:42,760 --> 02:02:44,760
No that would be probably on

3443
02:02:44,760 --> 02:02:46,760
Was it TBS?

3444
02:02:46,760 --> 02:02:48,760
Actually CW has a lot of those serial

3445
02:02:48,760 --> 02:02:50,760
Shows now right?

3446
02:02:50,760 --> 02:02:52,760
Supernatural is fucking still going

3447
02:02:52,760 --> 02:02:54,760
And it's still awesome

3448
02:02:54,760 --> 02:02:56,760
All these years later

3449
02:02:56,760 --> 02:02:58,760
All the DC shows are there

3450
02:02:58,760 --> 02:03:00,760
Supergirl is moving there right?

3451
02:03:00,760 --> 02:03:02,760
I'm so far behind

3452
02:03:02,760 --> 02:03:04,760
On all that stuff

3453
02:03:04,760 --> 02:03:06,760
I have to ask John from

3454
02:03:06,760 --> 02:03:08,760
Critical Myth because he still follows

3455
02:03:08,760 --> 02:03:10,760
All those shows and they write some great reviews

3456
02:03:10,760 --> 02:03:12,760
Over at VOG Network but I admittedly

3457
02:03:12,760 --> 02:03:14,760
Don't follow a lot of them

3458
02:03:14,760 --> 02:03:16,760
However I will say this

3459
02:03:16,760 --> 02:03:18,760
Dark Soccer maybe this is something you know about this

3460
02:03:18,760 --> 02:03:20,760
I realize this has nothing to do with games but it's very

3461
02:03:20,760 --> 02:03:22,760
Important

3462
02:03:22,760 --> 02:03:24,760
Can somebody explain to me why

3463
02:03:24,760 --> 02:03:26,760
Riverdale is so popular

3464
02:03:26,760 --> 02:03:28,760
I haven't watched it

3465
02:03:28,760 --> 02:03:30,760
It sounds kind of amazing

3466
02:03:30,760 --> 02:03:32,760
When I first heard about Riverdale I was like

3467
02:03:32,760 --> 02:03:34,760
Oh they're turning Archie from the comics

3468
02:03:34,760 --> 02:03:36,760
Into one of these shows that's gonna be a little ridiculous

3469
02:03:36,760 --> 02:03:38,760
But apparently it's like

3470
02:03:38,760 --> 02:03:40,760
Archie but like if all those characters

3471
02:03:40,760 --> 02:03:42,760
Were in Twin Peaks

3472
02:03:42,760 --> 02:03:44,760
What? Yeah that's what Riverdale

3473
02:03:44,760 --> 02:03:46,760
Is

3474
02:03:46,760 --> 02:03:48,760
It's like the dark version of

3475
02:03:48,760 --> 02:03:50,760
Archie

3476
02:03:50,760 --> 02:03:52,760
And it's all the same people like Veronica

3477
02:03:52,760 --> 02:03:54,760
Fucking Josie from Josie and the Pussycats

3478
02:03:54,760 --> 02:03:56,760
Is there too like it's yeah right?

3479
02:03:56,760 --> 02:03:58,760
That's the same face timing

3480
02:03:58,760 --> 02:04:00,760
They decided

3481
02:04:00,760 --> 02:04:02,760
We're gonna take

3482
02:04:02,760 --> 02:04:04,760
We're gonna take Batman

3483
02:04:04,760 --> 02:04:06,760
And make it dark

3484
02:04:06,760 --> 02:04:08,760
Is that Happily Ever After?

3485
02:04:08,760 --> 02:04:10,760
Or something like that?

3486
02:04:10,760 --> 02:04:12,760
What's that show that's with all the Disney

3487
02:04:12,760 --> 02:04:14,760
Oh Once Upon a Time

3488
02:04:14,760 --> 02:04:16,760
Once Upon a Time is that like

3489
02:04:16,760 --> 02:04:18,760
Once Upon a Time but in the Archie universe now?

3490
02:04:18,760 --> 02:04:20,760
Yes

3491
02:04:20,760 --> 02:04:22,760
Something like that I don't know

3492
02:04:22,760 --> 02:04:24,760
But apparently everybody I've seen on the Twitters

3493
02:04:24,760 --> 02:04:26,760
And all the stuff like Tumblr

3494
02:04:26,760 --> 02:04:28,760
They're putting shit up like there's

3495
02:04:28,760 --> 02:04:30,760
Gifts everywhere

3496
02:04:30,760 --> 02:04:32,760
And everything so I don't know

3497
02:04:32,760 --> 02:04:34,760
I feel like it's one of those shows I need to be

3498
02:04:34,760 --> 02:04:36,760
Seeing let's see I'm looking in chat

3499
02:04:36,760 --> 02:04:38,760
Over at live.vognetwork.com

3500
02:04:38,760 --> 02:04:40,760
Come on Noel Gus says Riverdale is pretty good

3501
02:04:40,760 --> 02:04:42,760
Brad from Pod Culture says

3502
02:04:42,760 --> 02:04:44,760
Supergirl is there I follow

3503
02:04:44,760 --> 02:04:46,760
All of them love Legends of Tomorrow

3504
02:04:46,760 --> 02:04:48,760
I know they started putting some of that on

3505
02:04:48,760 --> 02:04:50,760
Netflix so

3506
02:04:50,760 --> 02:04:52,760
I tried to see if Riverdale

3507
02:04:52,760 --> 02:04:54,760
If I ever stop hating on DC maybe I'll give them a chance

3508
02:04:54,760 --> 02:04:56,760
One of these days but no thanks

3509
02:04:56,760 --> 02:04:58,760
Where can I watch Riverdale online?

3510
02:04:58,760 --> 02:05:00,760
I would totally watch it

3511
02:05:00,760 --> 02:05:02,760
But it's not on Netflix

3512
02:05:02,760 --> 02:05:04,760
New shows usually aren't

3513
02:05:04,760 --> 02:05:06,760
Hulu I've been using

3514
02:05:06,760 --> 02:05:08,760
I have a friend that I may or may not

3515
02:05:08,760 --> 02:05:10,760
Be borrowing their Hulu account

3516
02:05:10,760 --> 02:05:12,760
So I can watch Golden Girls

3517
02:05:12,760 --> 02:05:14,760
And I tried to see I was like

3518
02:05:14,760 --> 02:05:16,760
Oh maybe usually that type of stuff shows up there

3519
02:05:16,760 --> 02:05:18,760
But there's no Riverdale on Hulu either

3520
02:05:18,760 --> 02:05:20,760
But that's fine because I still have like

3521
02:05:20,760 --> 02:05:22,760
160 episodes of Golden Girls left to watch

3522
02:05:22,760 --> 02:05:24,760
Thank you a couple weekends

3523
02:05:24,760 --> 02:05:26,760
It will take me a little while

3524
02:05:26,760 --> 02:05:28,760
Maybe by then you know the new season of

3525
02:05:28,760 --> 02:05:30,760
Stranger Things will be out so

3526
02:05:30,760 --> 02:05:32,760
Oh there's a CW app that's apparently

3527
02:05:32,760 --> 02:05:34,760
totally free

3528
02:05:34,760 --> 02:05:36,760
Like on

3529
02:05:36,760 --> 02:05:38,760
Playstation or Xbox

3530
02:05:38,760 --> 02:05:40,760
The Android TV

3531
02:05:40,760 --> 02:05:42,760
The Play Store has that and I'm like

3532
02:05:42,760 --> 02:05:44,760
Oh CW what the hell do I need this for

3533
02:05:44,760 --> 02:05:46,760
Maybe they have

3534
02:05:46,760 --> 02:05:48,760
Because my fucking TV has apps

3535
02:05:48,760 --> 02:05:50,760
So maybe it's like a Samsung TV

3536
02:05:50,760 --> 02:05:52,760
Because Netflix is built into my TV

3537
02:05:52,760 --> 02:05:54,760
So maybe they have that

3538
02:05:54,760 --> 02:05:56,760
I'm going to look for that stuff

3539
02:05:56,760 --> 02:05:58,760
Oh Rama says Comcast on Demand

3540
02:05:58,760 --> 02:06:00,760
Thank you Rama

3541
02:06:00,760 --> 02:06:02,760
I have Comcast on Demand

3542
02:06:02,760 --> 02:06:04,760
I never use it but I will check out this show

3543
02:06:04,760 --> 02:06:06,760
Because I'm very curious

3544
02:06:06,760 --> 02:06:08,760
I have a purpose now for Comcast on Demand

3545
02:06:08,760 --> 02:06:10,760
Alright

3546
02:06:10,760 --> 02:06:12,760
DarkSakura why are you telling people to fight you in chat

3547
02:06:12,760 --> 02:06:14,760
What are you doing

3548
02:06:14,760 --> 02:06:16,760
Shots have been fired

3549
02:06:16,760 --> 02:06:18,760
Why what was fired

3550
02:06:18,760 --> 02:06:20,760
Brad says that DC is better than Marvel

3551
02:06:20,760 --> 02:06:22,760
for TV and I'm like

3552
02:06:22,760 --> 02:06:24,760
Marvel is better than DC for everything

3553
02:06:24,760 --> 02:06:26,760
Brad's been saying that you two

3554
02:06:26,760 --> 02:06:28,760
go back and forth on the DC and

3555
02:06:28,760 --> 02:06:30,760
Marvel thing for forever

3556
02:06:30,760 --> 02:06:32,760
I haven't watched really any of them so I can't make a judgement

3557
02:06:32,760 --> 02:06:34,760
at this point

3558
02:06:34,760 --> 02:06:36,760
I think you and Brad need to do a podcast

3559
02:06:36,760 --> 02:06:38,760
together called Fight Me

3560
02:06:38,760 --> 02:06:40,760
and it's just a DC

3561
02:06:40,760 --> 02:06:42,760
Marvel wank fest every week

3562
02:06:42,760 --> 02:06:44,760
I don't even like DC enough to entertain

3563
02:06:44,760 --> 02:06:46,760
that it might be good

3564
02:06:46,760 --> 02:06:48,760
You're such a bitch

3565
02:06:48,760 --> 02:06:50,760
and I love it

3566
02:06:50,760 --> 02:06:52,760
I like Suicide Squad

3567
02:06:52,760 --> 02:06:54,760
Because you know what

3568
02:06:54,760 --> 02:06:56,760
it wasn't quite like they were in the comics

3569
02:06:56,760 --> 02:06:58,760
Actually I'll tell you this right now

3570
02:06:58,760 --> 02:07:00,760
I have gone back to buying physical comic books

3571
02:07:00,760 --> 02:07:02,760
again because of one fucking series

3572
02:07:02,760 --> 02:07:04,760
I now have a new

3573
02:07:04,760 --> 02:07:06,760
series of Jessica Jones

3574
02:07:06,760 --> 02:07:08,760
in comics

3575
02:07:08,760 --> 02:07:10,760
just focused on her

3576
02:07:10,760 --> 02:07:12,760
in the actual comic universe and not the TV universe

3577
02:07:12,760 --> 02:07:14,760
and it's perfect

3578
02:07:14,760 --> 02:07:16,760
Here's the thing

3579
02:07:16,760 --> 02:07:18,760
Dark Soccer and I know you're going to plug your ears and say

3580
02:07:18,760 --> 02:07:20,760
la la la but I'm going to try anyway

3581
02:07:20,760 --> 02:07:22,760
You should give

3582
02:07:22,760 --> 02:07:24,760
if you're going to give any of this shit a chance

3583
02:07:24,760 --> 02:07:26,760
try Supergirl

3584
02:07:26,760 --> 02:07:28,760
Everything I've heard about that show

3585
02:07:28,760 --> 02:07:30,760
I feel like you might dig it

3586
02:07:30,760 --> 02:07:32,760
Okay I will admit this

3587
02:07:32,760 --> 02:07:34,760
I do have Supergirl on DVD

3588
02:07:34,760 --> 02:07:36,760
because I fucking love that movie as a kid

3589
02:07:36,760 --> 02:07:38,760
I'm not even talking about the fucking movie

3590
02:07:38,760 --> 02:07:40,760
But

3591
02:07:40,760 --> 02:07:42,760
But

3592
02:07:42,760 --> 02:07:44,760
I have considered

3593
02:07:44,760 --> 02:07:46,760
giving the TV show a try

3594
02:07:46,760 --> 02:07:48,760
because of my love for the old movie

3595
02:07:48,760 --> 02:07:50,760
There you go and the old movie is not even

3596
02:07:50,760 --> 02:07:52,760
that good you guys

3597
02:07:52,760 --> 02:07:54,760
I don't fucking care because it has

3598
02:07:54,760 --> 02:07:56,760
Faye Dunaway in it as the bad guy

3599
02:07:56,760 --> 02:07:58,760
I just want to remind you all this chick stands

3600
02:07:58,760 --> 02:08:00,760
for Xanadu

3601
02:08:00,760 --> 02:08:02,760
I love Xanadu

3602
02:08:02,760 --> 02:08:04,760
You shut up about Xanadu because you know what

3603
02:08:04,760 --> 02:08:06,760
Don Bluth

3604
02:08:06,760 --> 02:08:08,760
In the studios took time out of their

3605
02:08:08,760 --> 02:08:10,760
busy schedule producing

3606
02:08:10,760 --> 02:08:12,760
The Secret of Nim

3607
02:08:12,760 --> 02:08:14,760
No no The Secret of Nim at the time

3608
02:08:14,760 --> 02:08:16,760
to do Xanadu

3609
02:08:16,760 --> 02:08:18,760
to do that one little bit in Xanadu

3610
02:08:18,760 --> 02:08:20,760
and almost delayed the release of

3611
02:08:20,760 --> 02:08:22,760
The Secret of Nim which is also

3612
02:08:22,760 --> 02:08:24,760
one of my other favorite fucking movies of all time so don't judge me

3613
02:08:24,760 --> 02:08:26,760
I will fight everyone

3614
02:08:26,760 --> 02:08:28,760
Here's Brad from Pod Culture with the

3615
02:08:28,760 --> 02:08:30,760
selling line

3616
02:08:30,760 --> 02:08:32,760
The chick from the original movie plays

3617
02:08:32,760 --> 02:08:34,760
Supergirl's adopted mom on the show

3618
02:08:34,760 --> 02:08:36,760
I sold

3619
02:08:36,760 --> 02:08:38,760
Oh fuck

3620
02:08:38,760 --> 02:08:40,760
I know her name

3621
02:08:40,760 --> 02:08:42,760
Helen something

3622
02:08:42,760 --> 02:08:44,760
How did I know that?

3623
02:08:44,760 --> 02:08:46,760
How did I know that?

3624
02:08:46,760 --> 02:08:48,760
You know what else she was in?

3625
02:08:48,760 --> 02:08:50,760
She was in The Legend of Billie Jean

3626
02:08:50,760 --> 02:08:52,760
I feel like I had to tap into gay superpowers

3627
02:08:52,760 --> 02:08:54,760
to remember that

3628
02:08:54,760 --> 02:08:56,760
We just have a knack for pop culture

3629
02:08:56,760 --> 02:08:58,760
The Legend of Billie Jean was also a great movie

3630
02:08:58,760 --> 02:09:00,760
Alright

3631
02:09:00,760 --> 02:09:02,760
Moving on

3632
02:09:02,760 --> 02:09:04,760
Let's talk about

3633
02:09:04,760 --> 02:09:06,760
Let's talk about an awesome series on the Atari 2600

3634
02:09:06,760 --> 02:09:08,760
that you may or may not have ever played

3635
02:09:08,760 --> 02:09:10,760
It's Sword Quest

3636
02:09:10,760 --> 02:09:12,760
Did you ever play these Sword Quest games?

3637
02:09:12,760 --> 02:09:14,760
They were kind of hard to understand

3638
02:09:14,760 --> 02:09:16,760
especially at a young age that I was

3639
02:09:16,760 --> 02:09:18,760
when these games first came out

3640
02:09:18,760 --> 02:09:20,760
They were kind of like a bunch of mini games

3641
02:09:20,760 --> 02:09:22,760
but they all came together for this larger purpose

3642
02:09:22,760 --> 02:09:24,760
of you were trying to look for

3643
02:09:24,760 --> 02:09:26,760
items and traverse the kingdom

3644
02:09:26,760 --> 02:09:28,760
and all this stuff

3645
02:09:28,760 --> 02:09:30,760
1982 was when the first game in the series

3646
02:09:30,760 --> 02:09:32,760
came out it was Earthworld

3647
02:09:32,760 --> 02:09:34,760
and then finally Fireworld

3648
02:09:34,760 --> 02:09:36,760
came out in 1983

3649
02:09:36,760 --> 02:09:38,760
and 1983 unfortunately

3650
02:09:38,760 --> 02:09:40,760
is when the video game industry went

3651
02:09:40,760 --> 02:09:42,760
so the series was never really finished

3652
02:09:42,760 --> 02:09:44,760
Waterworld

3653
02:09:44,760 --> 02:09:46,760
did I think get released

3654
02:09:46,760 --> 02:09:48,760
really limitedly

3655
02:09:48,760 --> 02:09:50,760
through Club Atari and I think you can

3656
02:09:50,760 --> 02:09:52,760
get it on some of the flashback stuff

3657
02:09:52,760 --> 02:09:54,760
now and then Airworld

3658
02:09:54,760 --> 02:09:56,760
which was supposed to be the last game was never made

3659
02:09:56,760 --> 02:09:58,760
and the interesting thing about this series is that

3660
02:09:58,760 --> 02:10:00,760
there was a prize like it was supposed to be like

3661
02:10:00,760 --> 02:10:02,760
if you were the first person to crack the code

3662
02:10:02,760 --> 02:10:04,760
you got this prize thing

3663
02:10:04,760 --> 02:10:06,760
that was worth like a quarter million dollars

3664
02:10:06,760 --> 02:10:08,760
which in the 80's was a lot more

3665
02:10:08,760 --> 02:10:10,760
money than it is today and so it was like

3666
02:10:10,760 --> 02:10:12,760
a lot of money but they never ended up having to

3667
02:10:12,760 --> 02:10:14,760
give the thing away because they never really

3668
02:10:14,760 --> 02:10:16,760
finished the series. Here's what's interesting

3669
02:10:16,760 --> 02:10:18,760
Dynamite Entertainment has picked up

3670
02:10:18,760 --> 02:10:20,760
the rights to Sword Quest they are

3671
02:10:20,760 --> 02:10:22,760
going to launch a comic book series

3672
02:10:22,760 --> 02:10:24,760
beginning in May

3673
02:10:24,760 --> 02:10:26,760
to actually finish

3674
02:10:26,760 --> 02:10:28,760
the story of Sword Quest

3675
02:10:28,760 --> 02:10:30,760
which Atari 2600 games

3676
02:10:30,760 --> 02:10:32,760
didn't have much story

3677
02:10:32,760 --> 02:10:34,760
I seem to remember these games

3678
02:10:34,760 --> 02:10:36,760
I think were like comic book style manuals

3679
02:10:36,760 --> 02:10:38,760
of their own that told a story

3680
02:10:38,760 --> 02:10:40,760
so it's interesting that it's all

3681
02:10:40,760 --> 02:10:42,760
coming back so that's cool

3682
02:10:42,760 --> 02:10:44,760
the creative team

3683
02:10:44,760 --> 02:10:46,760
behind Sword Quest is going to be

3684
02:10:46,760 --> 02:10:48,760
Chris Simms who wrote Marvel's

3685
02:10:48,760 --> 02:10:50,760
X-Men 92 series

3686
02:10:50,760 --> 02:10:52,760
and artist Scott

3687
02:10:52,760 --> 02:10:54,760
Kolichuk who did Batman

3688
02:10:54,760 --> 02:10:56,760
66 for a bit

3689
02:10:56,760 --> 02:10:58,760
so that's pretty cool so check that

3690
02:10:58,760 --> 02:11:00,760
out because who knows if the Sword

3691
02:11:00,760 --> 02:11:02,760
Quest comic does well maybe it

3692
02:11:02,760 --> 02:11:04,760
will become a video game movie that doesn't

3693
02:11:04,760 --> 02:11:06,760
suck we'll see

3694
02:11:06,760 --> 02:11:08,760

3712
02:11:42,760 --> 02:11:44,760
Humanity has teamed up

3713
02:11:44,760 --> 02:11:46,760
with BioWare for a mass

3714
02:11:46,760 --> 02:11:48,760
effect pack and I

3715
02:11:48,760 --> 02:11:50,760
found out how many you can order at one time

3716
02:11:50,760 --> 02:11:52,760
three packs it's a dollar

3717
02:11:52,760 --> 02:11:54,760
a pack you fucking owe it to yourself

3718
02:11:54,760 --> 02:11:56,760
to not only buy the packs

3719
02:11:56,760 --> 02:11:58,760
but

3720
02:11:58,760 --> 02:12:00,760
also look at the beautiful fan art on the

3721
02:12:00,760 --> 02:12:02,760
page it's absolutely hilarious

3722
02:12:02,760 --> 02:12:04,760
but you will have to understand mass effect

3723
02:12:04,760 --> 02:12:06,760
a little bit for this deck to make any

3724
02:12:06,760 --> 02:12:08,760
sense at all right it's just a pack

3725
02:12:08,760 --> 02:12:10,760
but yeah yes but

3726
02:12:10,760 --> 02:12:12,760
if you try to like just throw it in your regular

3727
02:12:12,760 --> 02:12:14,760
Cards Against Humanity pack and like have

3728
02:12:14,760 --> 02:12:16,760
a party or whatever and your friends

3729
02:12:16,760 --> 02:12:18,760
like we invite Loki over and Loki doesn't play

3730
02:12:18,760 --> 02:12:20,760
mass effect he's not going to fucking get it

3731
02:12:20,760 --> 02:12:22,760
he's not going to get any of it

3732
02:12:22,760 --> 02:12:24,760
if anyone hangs out with me

3733
02:12:24,760 --> 02:12:26,760
they will get my mass effect references because I've

3734
02:12:26,760 --> 02:12:28,760
explained them and yes

3735
02:12:28,760 --> 02:12:30,760
I do have to thank Ranma I've actually

3736
02:12:30,760 --> 02:12:32,760
reposted this on masseffecting.tumblr.com

3737
02:12:32,760 --> 02:12:34,760
which is my mass effect blog

3738
02:12:34,760 --> 02:12:36,760
by the way I'm trying to get to

3739
02:12:36,760 --> 02:12:38,760
10,000 followers

3740
02:12:38,760 --> 02:12:40,760
you have 10,000 followers?

3741
02:12:40,760 --> 02:12:42,760
I have 9,400 and something right now

3742
02:12:42,760 --> 02:12:44,760
I'm trying to get to 10,000

3743
02:12:44,760 --> 02:12:46,760
because if I get to 10,000

3744
02:12:46,760 --> 02:12:48,760
I get to 3 with those kind of numbers

3745
02:12:48,760 --> 02:12:50,760
maybe

3746
02:12:50,760 --> 02:12:52,760
I don't know

3747
02:12:52,760 --> 02:12:54,760
I swear to god if her mass

3748
02:12:54,760 --> 02:12:56,760
her mass effecting blog is more

3749
02:12:56,760 --> 02:12:58,760
popular than anything on fog network

3750
02:12:58,760 --> 02:13:00,760
well I do

3751
02:13:00,760 --> 02:13:02,760
plug the show on my blog

3752
02:13:02,760 --> 02:13:04,760
I appreciate that we know what we need

3753
02:13:04,760 --> 02:13:06,760
more alien penis I know that's right

3754
02:13:06,760 --> 02:13:08,760
what video game can I exploit

3755
02:13:08,760 --> 02:13:10,760
the alien penis out of?

3756
02:13:10,760 --> 02:13:12,760
we take the engine

3757
02:13:12,760 --> 02:13:14,760
of the Conan

3758
02:13:14,760 --> 02:13:16,760
yes

3759
02:13:16,760 --> 02:13:18,760
and cross it with mass effect

3760
02:13:18,760 --> 02:13:20,760
mass effect exiles

3761
02:13:20,760 --> 02:13:22,760
totally changeable penis.com

3762
02:13:22,760 --> 02:13:24,760
perfect

3763
02:13:24,760 --> 02:13:26,760
you know how mass effecting started

3764
02:13:26,760 --> 02:13:28,760
you had like

3765
02:13:28,760 --> 02:13:30,760
one thing that got a million notes

3766
02:13:30,760 --> 02:13:32,760
or something and you were like I should exploit this

3767
02:13:32,760 --> 02:13:34,760
for an entire blog

3768
02:13:34,760 --> 02:13:36,760
I was looking at one of my screen caps

3769
02:13:36,760 --> 02:13:38,760
and it's one of the Turian characters cross eyed

3770
02:13:38,760 --> 02:13:40,760
so I just wrote

3771
02:13:40,760 --> 02:13:42,760
derpians under it and posted it on my blog

3772
02:13:42,760 --> 02:13:44,760
because I thought it was funny

3773
02:13:44,760 --> 02:13:46,760
cause that's what fucking happens on tumblr

3774
02:13:46,760 --> 02:13:48,760
outside of the pornography

3775
02:13:48,760 --> 02:13:50,760
I did have to do a little research cause I knew there was tons of porn

3776
02:13:50,760 --> 02:13:52,760
on tumblr I mean hello

3777
02:13:52,760 --> 02:13:54,760
but if you actually like did like what is tumblr

3778
02:13:54,760 --> 02:13:56,760
really supposed to be for

3779
02:13:56,760 --> 02:13:58,760
like what they told yahoo to buy it for

3780
02:13:58,760 --> 02:14:00,760
is just random

3781
02:14:00,760 --> 02:14:02,760
shit like what just dark soccer explained

3782
02:14:02,760 --> 02:14:04,760
for the most part it is just random shit

3783
02:14:04,760 --> 02:14:06,760
it's memes

3784
02:14:06,760 --> 02:14:08,760
dank fucking memes

3785
02:14:08,760 --> 02:14:10,760
but like I went from doing like one or so a week

3786
02:14:10,760 --> 02:14:12,760
to now doing one every fucking day

3787
02:14:12,760 --> 02:14:14,760
to the point that I have managed to get

3788
02:14:14,760 --> 02:14:16,760
out of doing two days worth of them

3789
02:14:16,760 --> 02:14:18,760

3790
02:14:18,760 --> 02:14:20,760

I'm gonna check in with loki or dark saga for any

3855
02:16:44,760 --> 02:16:46,760

02:16:50,760 --> 02:16:52,760

3868
02:17:12,760 --> 02:17:14,760
again this was just a ploy to get loki

3869
02:17:14,760 --> 02:17:16,760
to do his story clearly orange

3870
02:17:16,760 --> 02:17:18,760
lounge radio alright

3871
02:17:18,760 --> 02:17:20,760
loki why don't you finish up their thought

3872
02:17:20,760 --> 02:17:22,760
then so they apparently rent

3873
02:17:22,760 --> 02:17:24,760
public road carts

3874
02:17:24,760 --> 02:17:26,760
to any customer and they lend I guess a costume

3875
02:17:26,760 --> 02:17:28,760
of one of the characters

3876
02:17:28,760 --> 02:17:30,760
and then of course you

3877
02:17:30,760 --> 02:17:32,760
drive around and stuff so

3878
02:17:32,760 --> 02:17:34,760
and nintendo doesn't

3879
02:17:34,760 --> 02:17:36,760
like that because you know it's

3880
02:17:36,760 --> 02:17:38,760
um infringing on their

3881
02:17:38,760 --> 02:17:40,760

3882
02:17:40,760 --> 02:17:42,760

02:19:56,760 --> 02:19:58,760
bad uh mass effect

3951
02:19:58,760 --> 02:20:00,760
loki has to play mass effect

3952
02:20:00,760 --> 02:20:02,760
he doesn't have an emotional attachment

3953
02:20:02,760 --> 02:20:04,760
one way or another to it I just because I didn't

3954
02:20:04,760 --> 02:20:06,760
like it the first time I played I didn't get any

3955
02:20:06,760 --> 02:20:08,760
I have judgement

3956
02:20:08,760 --> 02:20:10,760
brilliant luck finding

3957
02:20:10,760 --> 02:20:12,760
brilliant we will fucking

3958
02:20:12,760 --> 02:20:14,760
make it happen there's somebody in sacramento has a

3959
02:20:14,760 --> 02:20:16,760
copy of I have judgement oh and now I just looked at

3960
02:20:16,760 --> 02:20:18,760
chat and bobby had already suggested it

3961
02:20:18,760 --> 02:20:20,760
stop he says for

3962
02:20:20,760 --> 02:20:22,760
loki his own game

3963
02:20:22,760 --> 02:20:24,760
hahahahaha

3964
02:20:24,760 --> 02:20:26,760
you have to code your game on stream

3965
02:20:26,760 --> 02:20:28,760
hahahahaha oh my god

3966
02:20:28,760 --> 02:20:30,760
that's even better

3967
02:20:30,760 --> 02:20:32,760
that's it we have a sub stream of just loki

3968
02:20:32,760 --> 02:20:34,760
no while you and I are playing

3969
02:20:34,760 --> 02:20:36,760
the games we hate loki

3970
02:20:36,760 --> 02:20:38,760
is forced to sit there and

3971
02:20:38,760 --> 02:20:40,760
work on his fucking game on the livestream

3972
02:20:40,760 --> 02:20:42,760
on the livestream that's fine I'm glad it has time to

3973
02:20:42,760 --> 02:20:44,760
actually work on that let's check in with loki

3974
02:20:44,760 --> 02:20:46,760
and see if he's done anything for his fucking game

3975
02:20:46,760 --> 02:20:48,760
hahahahaha right now he's in

3976
02:20:48,760 --> 02:20:50,760
the corner in a fetal position

3977
02:20:50,760 --> 02:20:52,760
check out this wonderfully handcrafted

3978
02:20:52,760 --> 02:20:54,760
3D geometric shape

3979
02:20:54,760 --> 02:20:56,760
of my middle finger

3980
02:20:56,760 --> 02:20:58,760
hahahahaha

3981
02:20:58,760 --> 02:21:00,760
I've been wanting to do a video game marathon

3982
02:21:00,760 --> 02:21:02,760
for like 10 years so I'm glad

3983
02:21:02,760 --> 02:21:04,760
something may come of this anyway

3984
02:21:04,760 --> 02:21:06,760
William Ritterface says loki has to dress as tingle

3985
02:21:06,760 --> 02:21:08,760
well that won't happen but maybe

3986
02:21:08,760 --> 02:21:10,760
we could get him to play the tingle

3987
02:21:10,760 --> 02:21:12,760
game on 3DS or something

3988
02:21:12,760 --> 02:21:14,760
you don't have a problem playing a game with tingle in it

3989
02:21:14,760 --> 02:21:16,760
yeah it's a little

3990
02:21:16,760 --> 02:21:18,760
I like to force him to work on his game

3991
02:21:18,760 --> 02:21:20,760
they should do a new game called tickle my tingle

3992
02:21:20,760 --> 02:21:22,760
hi you're on orange solids radio who's this

3993
02:21:22,760 --> 02:21:24,760
this is ron man I want to give a giant

3994
02:21:24,760 --> 02:21:26,760
fuck you to skype tonight ok

3995
02:21:26,760 --> 02:21:28,760
yeah you sound like you're like I feel like

3996
02:21:28,760 --> 02:21:30,760
your skype is on one side of the room

3997
02:21:30,760 --> 02:21:32,760
and you're on the other side of the room yelling

3998
02:21:32,760 --> 02:21:34,760
at it

3999
02:21:34,760 --> 02:21:36,760
here's the thing I went out and decided

4000
02:21:36,760 --> 02:21:38,760
to update one of the

4001
02:21:38,760 --> 02:21:40,760
usb adapters I do my podcast

4002
02:21:40,760 --> 02:21:42,760
with and I already set the settings

4003
02:21:42,760 --> 02:21:44,760
for the secondary device

4004
02:21:44,760 --> 02:21:46,760
for music

4005
02:21:46,760 --> 02:21:48,760
skype doesn't pay attention so

4006
02:21:48,760 --> 02:21:50,760
when the call picked up I'm like

4007
02:21:50,760 --> 02:21:52,760
it's coming through the headphones grab the headphones

4008
02:21:52,760 --> 02:21:54,760
I don't hear shit what the fuck is going on check the settings

4009
02:21:54,760 --> 02:21:56,760
coming through external sound blaster

4010
02:21:56,760 --> 02:21:58,760
I wasn't going to tell everybody you were that

4011
02:21:58,760 --> 02:22:00,760
fail call a minute ago but if you're going to

4012
02:22:00,760 --> 02:22:02,760
out yourself as that then fine

4013
02:22:02,760 --> 02:22:04,760
I have no problem owning up to that

4014
02:22:04,760 --> 02:22:06,760
I really don't because in between

4015
02:22:06,760 --> 02:22:08,760
that the fact that

4016
02:22:08,760 --> 02:22:10,760
I am missing half a carpet in my apartment

4017
02:22:10,760 --> 02:22:12,760
and the fact that I went IKEA shopping for

4018
02:22:12,760 --> 02:22:14,760
new furniture has been quite a week

4019
02:22:14,760 --> 02:22:16,760
alright what's on your mind

4020
02:22:16,760 --> 02:22:18,760
tonight Rama besides anger

4021
02:22:18,760 --> 02:22:20,760
two things I want to agree

4022
02:22:20,760 --> 02:22:22,760
with you on Cards Against Humanity

4023
02:22:22,760 --> 02:22:24,760
I have to when I go

4024
02:22:24,760 --> 02:22:26,760
out to conventions and certain events

4025
02:22:26,760 --> 02:22:28,760
I have to go through

4026
02:22:28,760 --> 02:22:30,760
my decks and take out certain

4027
02:22:30,760 --> 02:22:32,760
expansion packs so that people

4028
02:22:32,760 --> 02:22:34,760
do not get confused

4029
02:22:34,760 --> 02:22:36,760
oddly enough everyone who plays

4030
02:22:36,760 --> 02:22:38,760
this game are die hard gamers

4031
02:22:38,760 --> 02:22:40,760
geeks and nerds yes you probably

4032
02:22:40,760 --> 02:22:42,760
have like anime expansions

4033
02:22:42,760 --> 02:22:44,760
that if you tried to play with me I'd be like

4034
02:22:44,760 --> 02:22:46,760
I this sounds like it

4035
02:22:46,760 --> 02:22:48,760
might be funny actually

4036
02:22:48,760 --> 02:22:50,760
no the most you probably get

4037
02:22:50,760 --> 02:22:52,760
confused with is the Cards Against

4038
02:22:52,760 --> 02:22:54,760
New York Cards Against Brooklyn expansion

4039
02:22:54,760 --> 02:22:56,760
packs but you will pick up on that pretty

4040
02:22:56,760 --> 02:22:58,760
quick I think that I could

4041
02:22:58,760 --> 02:23:00,760
probably figure out I watch

4042
02:23:00,760 --> 02:23:02,760
enough cop shows

4043
02:23:02,760 --> 02:23:04,760
yeah I can kind of agree with that

4044
02:23:04,760 --> 02:23:06,760
what's the other thing

4045
02:23:06,760 --> 02:23:08,760
alright I'm coming I'm listening

4046
02:23:08,760 --> 02:23:10,760
to the shows which is why I was kind of late

4047
02:23:10,760 --> 02:23:12,760
getting the classic game in a week

4048
02:23:12,760 --> 02:23:14,760
up I want to give a shout out

4049
02:23:14,760 --> 02:23:16,760
to Jamie

4050
02:23:16,760 --> 02:23:18,760
ah the switch

4051
02:23:18,760 --> 02:23:20,760
the switch

4052
02:23:20,760 --> 02:23:22,760
I think we're probably the only

4053
02:23:22,760 --> 02:23:24,760
two that get that

4054
02:23:24,760 --> 02:23:26,760
when you said when you said

4055
02:23:26,760 --> 02:23:28,760
that somebody have to go out in the back

4056
02:23:28,760 --> 02:23:30,760
oh yeah

4057
02:23:30,760 --> 02:23:32,760
yes I've told

4058
02:23:32,760 --> 02:23:34,760
friends of mine stories of me

4059
02:23:34,760 --> 02:23:36,760
go out and get the switch

4060
02:23:36,760 --> 02:23:38,760
now you try to be a smart ass

4061
02:23:38,760 --> 02:23:40,760
and get like the smallest switch possible

4062
02:23:40,760 --> 02:23:42,760
and you think that oh

4063
02:23:42,760 --> 02:23:44,760
this will be an easy beating no

4064
02:23:44,760 --> 02:23:46,760
your mom still or your grandmother finds a way

4065
02:23:46,760 --> 02:23:48,760
to take this little switch

4066
02:23:48,760 --> 02:23:50,760
give you a sound beating and send you

4067
02:23:50,760 --> 02:23:52,760
back outside for a regulation size one

4068
02:23:52,760 --> 02:23:54,760
for round two oh no no no no

4069
02:23:54,760 --> 02:23:56,760
it was always you had to get something that

4070
02:23:56,760 --> 02:23:58,760
was right in between

4071
02:23:58,760 --> 02:24:00,760
the really

4072
02:24:00,760 --> 02:24:02,760
thin ones or a log

4073
02:24:04,760 --> 02:24:06,760
I'm going to have to be right in the middle of that

4074
02:24:06,760 --> 02:24:08,760
a switch is just the southern

4075
02:24:08,760 --> 02:24:10,760
version of the belt

4076
02:24:10,760 --> 02:24:12,760
or la chancla right

4077
02:24:14,760 --> 02:24:16,760
the switch is literally you go

4078
02:24:16,760 --> 02:24:18,760
and you find the camellia bush in your backyard

4079
02:24:18,760 --> 02:24:20,760
you pick it off

4080
02:24:20,760 --> 02:24:22,760
you pick all the leaves off of it

4081
02:24:22,760 --> 02:24:24,760
and you pray that you've gotten all the little

4082
02:24:24,760 --> 02:24:26,760
nubby bits too

4083
02:24:26,760 --> 02:24:28,760
see I didn't have that

4084
02:24:28,760 --> 02:24:30,760
where I lived they were

4085
02:24:30,760 --> 02:24:32,760
yellow honeysuckle

4086
02:24:32,760 --> 02:24:34,760
branches and bushes growing

4087
02:24:34,760 --> 02:24:36,760
that's where I had to pick it from

4088
02:24:38,760 --> 02:24:40,760
it was either camellias or azaleas

4089
02:24:40,760 --> 02:24:42,760
azaleas or camellias

4090
02:24:42,760 --> 02:24:44,760
and for the record

4091
02:24:44,760 --> 02:24:46,760
la chancla is the thong

4092
02:24:46,760 --> 02:24:48,760
shoes that when you piss

4093
02:24:48,760 --> 02:24:50,760
mom off she's going to take off her chancla

4094
02:24:50,760 --> 02:24:52,760
and beat you with it yeah

4095
02:24:52,760 --> 02:24:54,760
there is a shirt that says I survived la chancla

4096
02:24:54,760 --> 02:24:56,760
but we never used footwear because footwear

4097
02:24:56,760 --> 02:24:58,760
in the south is all cowboy boots that would murder a child

4098
02:25:00,760 --> 02:25:02,760
this murders the child

4099
02:25:04,760 --> 02:25:06,760
alright

4100
02:25:06,760 --> 02:25:08,760
you just want to make them wish they were dead

4101
02:25:08,760 --> 02:25:10,760
rama anything else you want to share with us tonight

4102
02:25:10,760 --> 02:25:12,760
I ran

4103
02:25:12,760 --> 02:25:14,760
the two japanese girls on the train

4104
02:25:14,760 --> 02:25:16,760
and they were amused by

4105
02:25:16,760 --> 02:25:18,760
my wireless

4106
02:25:18,760 --> 02:25:20,760
headphones because you have custom

4107
02:25:20,760 --> 02:25:22,760
ear pads on them mine has the

4108
02:25:22,760 --> 02:25:24,760
one half logo on them they found it quite cute

4109
02:25:24,760 --> 02:25:26,760
I have not seen

4110
02:25:26,760 --> 02:25:28,760
these headphones I bet it was adorable

4111
02:25:28,760 --> 02:25:30,760
if you go to vmoda and you get

4112
02:25:30,760 --> 02:25:32,760
the wireless crossfades you can get

4113
02:25:32,760 --> 02:25:34,760
custom 2d and 3d engraving

4114
02:25:34,760 --> 02:25:36,760
only in new york

4115
02:25:36,760 --> 02:25:38,760

02:25:38,760 --> 02:25:40,760
no I mean only in new york would these

4117
02:25:40,760 --> 02:25:42,760
types of things happen

4118
02:25:42,760 --> 02:25:44,760
pretty much I mean it got to the point

4119
02:25:44,760 --> 02:25:46,760
where I see someone in different colored hair I'm like

4208
02:28:44,760 --> 02:28:46,760
a retro mood so I think I'm gonna end up doing something

4209
02:28:46,760 --> 02:28:48,760
virtual console I just haven't decided yet

4210
02:28:48,760 --> 02:28:50,760
so you know it is on virtual console I started

4211
02:28:50,760 --> 02:28:52,760
and it already annoyed me hmm

4212
02:28:52,760 --> 02:28:54,760
mother oh yeah like the

4213
02:28:54,760 --> 02:28:56,760

right at the start of the game it was a different day

4218
02:29:04,760 --> 02:29:06,760
and age that's for sure so

4219
02:29:06,760 --> 02:29:08,760
all right well nobody

4220
02:29:08,760 --> 02:29:10,760

for calls tonight I know a lot of our

4222
02:29:12,760 --> 02:29:14,760

I saw in the theaters was warcraft

so I haven't seen any of these movies so I

4243
02:29:54,760 --> 02:29:56,760
have no doctor strange I have no opinion

4244
02:29:56,760 --> 02:29:58,760
but before that it was warcraft um

4245
02:29:58,760 --> 02:30:00,760
I want to see

4246
02:30:00,760 --> 02:30:02,760

4247
02:30:02,760 --> 02:30:04,760

4251
02:30:10,760 --> 02:30:12,760
one where it flips with the scenes uh

4252
02:30:12,760 --> 02:30:14,760
where it does the I saw this once

4253
02:30:14,760 --> 02:30:16,760

says no best picture yet

4260
02:30:28,760 --> 02:30:30,760
but the director just won I'm assuming the

4261
02:30:30,760 --> 02:30:32,760
director for La La Land won

4262
02:30:32,760 --> 02:30:34,760
what the fuck ever and usually usually

4263
02:30:34,760 --> 02:30:36,760
the director and the picture are the same thing actually

4264
02:30:36,760 --> 02:30:38,760
not all the past couple years that trend's been

4265
02:30:38,760 --> 02:30:40,760
broken I think they've they've split

4266
02:30:40,760 --> 02:30:42,760
up a little bit so

4267
02:30:42,760 --> 02:30:44,760

thought is um

4296
02:31:40,760 --> 02:31:42,760

4299
02:31:46,760 --> 02:31:48,760
uh Loki uh

4300
02:31:48,760 --> 02:31:50,760
my final thought is I can't wait to uh

4301
02:31:50,760 --> 02:31:52,760
play with these little mini arcade machines that Dark

4302
02:31:52,760 --> 02:31:54,760
Sakura bought me although now I'm

4303
02:31:54,760 --> 02:31:56,760
at that point where I'm like do I leave him in the

4304
02:31:56,760 --> 02:31:58,760
box as a collector or do I take

4305
02:31:58,760 --> 02:32:00,760
yeah I feel like I have to

4306
02:32:00,760 --> 02:32:02,760
take them out of the box and actually play them

4307
02:32:02,760 --> 02:32:04,760
they're not gonna go

4308
02:32:04,760 --> 02:32:06,760
up in value that much

4309
02:32:06,760 --> 02:32:08,760
you should find these things on eBay

4310
02:32:08,760 --> 02:32:10,760
actually people are flipping them on eBay I couldn't believe it

4311
02:32:10,760 --> 02:32:12,760
these people are dumb

4312
02:32:12,760 --> 02:32:14,760

4313
02:32:14,760 --> 02:32:16,760

02:32:26,760 --> 02:32:28,760
for a while actually

4320
02:32:28,760 --> 02:32:30,760
it was noticed that we've kind of been missing out do you

4321
02:32:30,760 --> 02:32:32,760

02:32:36,760 --> 02:32:38,760
without the music no we talked last week

4325
02:32:38,760 --> 02:32:40,760
we noticed ever since we shifted our show roll around

4326
02:32:40,760 --> 02:32:42,760
where FUs were supposed to be at the end we've kind of

4327
02:32:42,760 --> 02:32:44,760
just been ending the show but

4328
02:32:44,760 --> 02:32:46,760
we said FUs will still be done on an as needed

4329
02:32:46,760 --> 02:32:48,760
basis so it sounds like

4330
02:32:48,760 --> 02:32:50,760
well alright tonight it is needed Dark Sakura has asked

4331
02:32:50,760 --> 02:32:52,760

4356
02:33:42,760 --> 02:33:44,760
