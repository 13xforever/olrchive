0	7000	Orange, Lounge, Radio
7000	15000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
15000	27000	Tonight, new Pokemon come to Pokemon Go, so you've got to catch them all, just like one YouTuber caught a Nintendo Switch this week. But you know there's more to that story, coming up on the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange, Lounge, Radio
31000	45000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange, Lounge, Radio. Live tonight, episode number 676 for this February the 19th of 2017.
46000	63000	My name is Rob Roberts coming to you live out of our little studio N7 here in Sacramento, California with my co-host not here tonight, DarkSakura. Jamie Summers is out for the night. She had a pretty nasty cough or something and she was a little worried about doing radio for three hours when she had the plague over in the corner.
63000	75000	So hopefully she's feeling better, taking the opportunity to rest up or what have you. And by saying rest up with my quotey fingers, what I really mean is she's replaying the entire Mass Effect trilogy in anticipation for Andromeda, which I don't blame her.
75000	82000	I may or may not have made that up, but let's be real, it's true. But who is joining us tonight? Say hello to Techmaster Loki.
82000	83000	Hello. Hi Loki, how are you doing?
83000	86000	Fine, looking for my USB cord that I thought I brought, but apparently I didn't.
86000	88000	USB cord? What's that for?
88000	89000	I charge my phone.
90000	92000	You have his iPhone, right? Or Android?
92000	93000	Android.
93000	96000	I can steal Alan's thing in the bedroom if you need.
96000	98000	I'll just turn off all the...
98000	103000	Please, please. This is a nerd household. We have chargers, Loki, if you are for sure.
103000	111000	I specifically remember taking the charger off because I had my controller plugging, my DualShock 4 charging, and I took it out and I rolled it up.
111000	117000	And then that's the last I remember of what I did with it. I thought I put it in my bag, but it's not there.
118000	120000	I've never lost one of those.
120000	131000	Yeah, I think our mini-USB, I don't know what happened to it. I don't know if it's the one that I sent to my buddy Brad from PodCulture when he bought the PlayStation 4 because I wanted to make sure he had one.
131000	137000	I don't know if that was the one, but then it's like, well, my PS4 Pro should have had one, right? And I can't find it.
137000	142000	And I don't know if I maybe used it to charge a Vita somewhere or what it is, but I'm missing one of those controller cords.
142000	154000	So I ended up using, I had to find like a, we have like a cell phone charger that I use on my PlayStation 4 to charge a controller, or which actually I have two controllers now, thanks to a very lovely Christmas gift.
154000	160000	So when one dies, I just, oh, get the other one on and save the day. I can go right back to Overwatch. That works.
160000	175000	Hey, not just us here in studio, but you guys, of course, always joining us live every week because we do tape live at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
175000	187000	That's vognetwork.com. And of course, there's lots of comments in our chat, including, come on, Noel Gus, who's starting us off tonight saying, OMG, how many Gen 2 Pokémon has Sky caught already?
187000	198000	I'm going to say at least 20. I don't think it's that high. I know we're going to get into the whole Gen 2 Pokémon thing a little bit later, so I don't mean to ruin it, but I know it's been on a lot of his minds.
198000	207000	And the thing is, I wanted to go out and catch as much as I could because it's been raining like crap here. And I think you guys have seen the news, the rain in California.
207000	217000	Now, a lot of what happened right at the end of the week affected Southern California more. We're not there. We're in Northern California. You might remember we started off last week's show.
217000	228000	We talked about what was happening IRL, and that was the whole Oroville Dam thing, which I know made national news. That's, you know, we're far enough away from all that, but that's still, you know, I've been to Oroville several times.
228000	240000	I used to live up there. So, I mean, there's not in Oroville. I lived in Chico, which isn't far. It's where all the people were evacuating to. But anyway, the weather's been on everybody's minds up here, and now we've got like another big storm coming in.
240000	252000	So, my point is, it's great that they released all these Pokémon, but it's been fucking raining every single day. I can't go out and enjoy it. But it wasn't, there was a little bit yesterday, it wasn't really raining yesterday.
252000	263000	It was actually a lovely day. So, I was able to go out and do some catching. So, while I was talking there to buy time, I actually was bringing up my Pokédex because I wanted to see what it was currently at.
263000	278000	So, I'm at Kot 160, scene 171. And I think I was at 142 before Gen 2 launched in Kot, so that means I would have 18 of them. And that sounds about right. I think I have about 18 of the new Pokémon.
278000	286000	A few from Evolving and so forth. I got one of those King Stones or whatever that lets you do a Slow King, which apparently are really rare from Pokéstops.
286000	288000	Where do you get those from?
288000	298000	Pokéstops. They just, they randomly show up when you hack Pokéstops. But you know, with the Pogo Plus, sometimes if I'm running low on Pokéballs, I'll drive through downtown on my way home.
298000	304000	So, I can just buzz, buzz, buzz. I can be safe and drive and not actually play. All I have to do is push a button, which is very, very easy to do.
304000	312000	So, on one of my trips through downtown is when I got that King Stone right after Gen 2 launched. I was able to do that. So, that was nice.
313000	319000	Anyway, let's see. Bobby Blackwolf, our pal in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,
319000	327000	We were pissed when Pokémon Go came out, that it came out when it was 100 degrees outside. Now we're upset about a little water. Make up your mind, gamers.
327000	333000	We're gamers. We complain about everything. Remember, Bobby? What's the website, Bobby? Come on. Gamershateeverything.com.
333000	337000	That is the truth. Remember, Bobby? You built that site. You should know that.
337000	344000	Let's see. What else here? Maya in chat says, It snowed all of twice this winter here in Chicago.
344000	354000	Yeah, that's so weird that like California is getting drought ending precipitation. Like, they said it would not take, we would not be able to fix the drought with a year of rain.
354000	360000	Well, guess what? Now they're saying, at least for Northern California, they're saying no more drought in Northern California. So, California is a different story.
360000	371000	So, it's just kind of, you know, I think the funniest tweet I saw all throughout this was something like, We have prayed for five years for this drought to end.
371000	377000	Maybe we should have spaced that out a little bit and not prayed all at once. Sorry. It's funnier if you read it on Twitter.
377000	387000	Anyway, actdev says, Use your Go Plus and take an umbrella. Yeah, I know. If it's light rain, I'll wear my hoodie and try to like walk short distances and do it that way.
387000	395000	Or I could just be a fool and play it in the car. I don't know. Anyway, we'll read more of your comments throughout tonight's show over at live.vaganetwork.com.
395000	404000	But I want to get into tonight's kickoff topic. Actually, I have two things. First, I want to do a follow up real quick, because we talked a lot about E3 and the fact that E3 was opening up to the public last week.
404000	415000	And we sat here on the show and said, Oh, it'll be gone in 10 minutes. Like, if you're not there, the minute it opens, you're not getting a ticket. Well, turns out that didn't seem to be the case.
415000	428000	Now, I do know a few people that did get an E3 ticket. And even though I talked about my personal reasons why I am not interested in going, I'm still really happy for my friends who have either not been in a long time, or have never been, who are going to get to go.
428000	438000	And you know what, I hope all my cynicism about E3, I hope it's proved wrong. I hope they do whatever they need to do to make it, you know, the party that people are hoping to sign up and go to.
438000	444000	I remain skeptical, but I would love to be wrong about that for the sake of my friends who are going to get to go for the first time.
444000	455000	But even though, you know, I know a few people that bought tickets and are going, it doesn't seem like it sold out that fast. In fact, I'm not sure, question mark, I don't see it on E3's Twitter that they ever sold out.
455000	462000	Did they not sell 15,000 tickets to E3? Because in my opinion, especially compared to PAX, that's really surprising.
463000	465000	The tickets are probably much more than PAX, obviously.
465000	473000	Not by much. What is it, $2.49 for E3, Loki? E3? This was supposed to be the show when we, especially when we were like in high school and stuff.
473000	474000	It used to be the show.
475000	484000	Do you think some of this negative chatter, I mean, from, I don't, I'm sure we're not the only podcast kind of sitting out there going, well, E3 isn't what it used to be today.
484000	497000	I think there's a lot of, I think even I caught some of that cynicism in some pretty major websites that were running pieces on it in talking about the show opening up to everybody is that people were kind of saying like, well, people might get a ticket, but it's not going to be what they expect.
497000	514000	Do you think some of that cynicism caused this to happen? Or what do you think? Do you think it's, or, I mean, and to be fair, is it just as simple as the con, the con is a Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, which is kind of a really bad time for, you know, 20 somethings to
515000	530000	I think it's a lot of things. I think, you don't really do that anymore to like find out what stuff, you know, is coming out. Nowadays, they stream everything. Before it used to be, oh, we'd stream like the big three and that's it.
530000	542000	But everything's being streamed now. It's all presentations. And if you want to just see the titles, you don't actually want to get hands on with them, which to be honest, you're not necessarily guaranteed to get hands on with anything when you go there.
542000	559000	Then you can just stay at home and do all that. You don't need to force your way down there and spend three days. And honestly, a lot of times when I'd spend three days down there, I would come out with less information than had I just absorbed it all through streaming.
559000	575000	Now William Murderface in our chat over at live.vognetware.com says, I'm pretty sure you can't buy general expo passes anymore. So maybe they did disappear and I somehow missed the memo on this. However, I think it's safe to say it certainly didn't sell out as fast as a PAX does.
575000	578000	Which is probably why they didn't talk about it.
578000	589000	I think that's a point that merits discussion, still a little bit. The holiest of holy gaming shows did not sell at the rate that many of us anticipated it to.
589000	601000	And also, I think this time, at least compared to some of the other times when they had Kensha Hall, there's less to see, I think. It's more of just like, are you going to see everything in a couple days?
601000	612000	Well, you know, I was thinking about it this week and I know at one of the last E3s I did go to, they had a pretty good chunk of the floor where they actually had like old arcade games that you could play. They have like a video game museum type thing set up.
612000	615000	That's cool, but I'm not paying $250 to go play old arcade games.
615000	622000	But what I'm saying with that is that we've seen a little bit of a shift where things like that are showing up at E3, so maybe there's just going to be more of that this year.
622000	634000	I mean, I do feel like there's a lot of space still on the first floor that they, at least again, I can only reference a show I went to a few years ago, but I remember they used to have an art show in the middle between the two concourses.
634000	646000	Seems like you could cram a lot more in there. I mean, no disrespect to art, but you could, it was not a lot of art filling up a very big space. Like they could put the art in a smaller space and have more gaming type stuff in there.
646000	652000	I mean, I don't know. There's a lot of things they could do. I still think there's a lot of space on that first floor they could kind of fill out a little bit.
652000	661000	And maybe they're still going to do stuff out in the parking lots and all this stuff. Or maybe even the next door thing. We haven't really, really heard if any of that's going to get utilized.
661000	665000	Get some sweet multiplayer going on with Switch games by that time.
665000	674000	Switch or who knows, Microsoft, you know, we'll get into it later in the show, but it's no secret that they've got a new system for the holidays that they're going to be pimping.
674000	681000	Maybe Microsoft wants to show off some of the sweet 4K visuals or whatever else they're going to end up pimping with this system.
681000	687000	So, you know, I'm just interested to see how E3 is going to transform with all this. We'll see.
687000	692000	Going to some other comments in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, DungeonBuster says,
692000	699000	E3 also doesn't offer many of the same things that PAX does. Dealers, tables, cosplay events, game rooms, etc. That can be a draw for some people.
699000	705000	Well, they do have an official E3 store. I got an E3 shot glass for Alan one year.
705000	714000	Or the Disney term, a toothpick holder. Did you know you can get a shot glass at Disneyland, but they call it a toothpick holder.
714000	719000	They won't call it a shot glass, because Disney. Fun fact. Let's see.
719000	727000	Maya in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, E3 is trying to remain revenue positive in the face of many big names abandoning the show floor.
727000	731000	15,000 paying attendees will help. Yeah, we did talk about that a little bit.
731000	735000	You know, 250 a pop is no small, you know, that's going to be what, like $4 million?
735000	739000	That's probably what a couple of these companies were paying to be out on the show floor.
739000	746000	So, I mean, it's a creative way to make money, I suppose. But at what cost to the show itself?
746000	751000	Or maybe what benefit? We won't know until E3 happens this year.
751000	756000	Or we get some more details on what exactly those 15,000 people are going to get to experience. So, we'll see.
756000	762000	Anyway, just a little bit of follow-up. I wanted to make sure we properly followed up with that.
762000	767000	Because believe it or not, when we do miss the mark on something, I'm willing to talk about it.
767000	772000	I mean, all we can do here sometimes is speculate and be a little bit of armchair predictors.
772000	776000	And sometimes we get it right. In fact, more than I think we get credit for, we get it right.
776000	781000	But sometimes we're going to get it wrong. And I think it's good to sit down and talk about, well, why did we get it wrong?
781000	787000	And we learn from it. Anyway, let's talk about something a little more positive, actually.
787000	792000	Because there's a lot of negativity out there in gaming and the community and so forth.
792000	796000	And I know we have some rough stuff we're going to get into with the Switch tonight.
796000	802000	And I know people don't want us to be Debbie Downers 100% of the time.
802000	809000	So I want to focus a little bit, especially since this week was Valentine's Day, or Singles Awareness Day as the case may be.
809000	813000	Whatever it was you were celebrating on the 14th, I hope you had a fantastic time.
813000	820000	If that was eating a nice dinner with a loved one or eating discount chocolate by yourself, I hope you had a fantastic time.
820000	825000	But since Valentine's Day is a, using my quoting fingers again, holiday about love,
825000	832000	I thought we could talk a little bit about, without getting too cheesy, I thought we could talk about video game moments that you love.
832000	835000	And why, you know, what are the things that happened in video games?
835000	840000	What are those moments that you really fell in love with in games that make you a gamer today?
840000	846000	And I open this up to our chatters. I really, really would love to hear some of your comments over at live.vognetwork.com.
846000	850000	Or if you are not engaged in chat, but you want to send a tweet real quick, at OLR.
850000	853000	I do have my phone up and I can read some of those tweets as well.
853000	860000	A video game moment that you loved that, like, after it was done, you were like, okay, I'm a gamer.
860000	865000	Like, this is why I'm a gamer. This is why I put up with all this cynical bullshit online.
865000	869000	And this is why I dredged through gamershateeverything.com and all this stuff.
869000	873000	And I am still a gamer at the end of the day. This is why I'm a gamer.
873000	877000	So, Loki, we need to hear from you. What are video game moments?
877000	881000	And it doesn't have to be like a classic story. It could be something recent.
881000	884000	Old, new, what's a video game moment you loved?
884000	891000	Well, let's see. Just thinking off the top of my head here, because there's a lot of moments that I love in video games.
891000	894000	Some of them, like Bobby had mentioned, some of the story beats in Saints Row IV.
894000	899000	Nothing really in Saints Row IV. But in Saints Row III, though.
899000	906000	I would say the introduction to Saints Row III really does qualify as like a video game moment that I love.
906000	912000	I do. It's just because it's so excessive and ridiculous.
912000	914000	It's fantastic.
914000	919000	Yes, right? And Loki, you love that shit even more than I do. Like the over-the-topness in video games.
919000	923000	I don't know how else you can justify your fandom of Earth Defense Force.
923000	930000	You know, it's hard nowadays because I didn't talk about it last week when Earth Defense Force 5 was announced.
931000	934000	How many Earth Defense Force games do we have to have come out where they're just like,
934000	937000	Oh my god, these are brand new aliens coming in!
937000	939000	It's like, my god, you get fucking tasked by ants all the time.
939000	941000	Positivity, Loki, positivity, positivity.
941000	951000	No, it's definitely, you know, I'd say the intro to Saints Row III and then also the part where you're taking over the penthouse where it's set to power.
951000	953000	I mean, that was pretty awesome.
953000	957000	Actually, this is a hell of a bunch of stuff from Saints Row is pretty awesome.
958000	960000	So, there's a lot of moments there.
960000	964000	And then, let's see what else.
964000	974000	Kind of not so much cheesy, but like, the beginning to Bioshock, well, the beginning of Bioshock 1, you know, when you're going down.
974000	979000	And then the beginning of Bioshock Infinite, or just like, whoa.
979000	981000	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I remember the intro to Bioshock Infinite.
981000	986000	And those were even games I didn't like super get into as much as everybody else, but that intro to Bioshock Infinite is something else.
987000	990000	It's just like, it's like, damn.
990000	996000	Yeah, it really makes a good argument for like, you know, games as art type thing. It's just really impactful, I think.
996000	1001000	And Bioshock's ending. I mean, that whole series, I think, is a big heart for a lot of people.
1001000	1006000	Gosh, well, I would say, you know, with this show, shit.
1006000	1015000	I mean, we were born our show out of the DDR scene, and there's a lot of stuff in the old school music game days that I really loved.
1015000	1023000	Like, I really loved that community that we had back in the day, you know, that we would meet at the arcade and play this loud, obnoxious video game.
1023000	1028000	But there was just something so cool about it because it was just, I don't know, it was just different, you know what I mean?
1028000	1034000	Like, it wasn't your typical video game. It was something where you were using your feet as a controller, and it was playing really bad techno music.
1034000	1039000	But it was okay to like this techno music because, you know, it was fun, and you were having exercise.
1039000	1042000	And I was never thinner in my life than those years I was playing DDR.
1042000	1046000	I mean, that was a moment that I really loved in gaming, was just, you know, back.
1046000	1053000	And that's why if I'm a little bitter betty towards Konami sometimes, it's because, you know, not just the recent stuff that's going on,
1053000	1059000	but the fact that I felt that those games were really abandoned after DDR Extreme, that for some reason they really just turned their back on it.
1059000	1062000	And I think all these years later, I have more insight to it.
1062000	1068000	Or just hearing some of the tracks in like DJ Hero were just like, you know, because it's all unique stuff.
1068000	1076000	And it was very cool to hear some of that stuff mashed up and actually get to build that as you're kind of playing. It was pretty awesome.
1076000	1080000	But I wanted to say a follow up on the DDR thing real quick. That's why I thought it was cool.
1080000	1088000	Like, you know, we got to talk about DDR again a little bit last week with the, you know, the representative from the United States winning the national tournament, or the international tournament, excuse me.
1088000	1094000	That was kind of cool to talk about, even though I feel bad where it's like, you know, I really, I don't follow this series like I used to anymore.
1094000	1102000	So some of this admittedly goes over my head, even though, hey, I still have to go to round one and my damn near 40 year old ass will still get up on a DDR machine.
1102000	1109000	And I don't give a fuck if anybody thinks like, oh, old guy on DDR, because you know what, I was playing this game before you kids could even walk.
1109000	1114000	But I thought it was cool that it was like DDR was kind of like back out there.
1114000	1120000	And so if that makes a new generation discover and Konami's found a way to strike gold again with it, then I think that's awesome.
1120000	1124000	So, I mean, that will certainly be a series that's always going to be near and dear to me.
1124000	1129000	MMOs, let's think about MMOs a little bit and moments I really loved in MMOs.
1129000	1139000	You know, I can talk about World of Warcraft and raiding and all that, but really, like, I think the first like, oh my God, I love this moment would really date back to Final Fantasy 11.
1139000	1140000	Yeah, Final Fantasy 11.
1140000	1141000	We're all playing that together.
1141000	1150000	One of those games, like the sense of scale of it was pretty awesome because when you first start off the game, you know, I start off in, was it Ron Fro or whatever.
1150000	1155000	And just like that first area seems so huge.
1155000	1160000	And then it's like, oh yeah, there's places beyond this. Like you can go way beyond this.
1160000	1163000	And it's just that sense of scale is like, oh my God, this is ridiculous.
1163000	1167000	I don't know how I'm going to handle being able to go out there and get killed immediately.
1167000	1174000	Yeah. Or the fact that you team up, I think for me it was like teaming up with people and like actually taking on quests together.
1174000	1181000	And like one of the things that jumps out in my mind, like I know there was like the early questing in the Valcrum Dunes where you're getting XP and all that stuff.
1181000	1191000	But I'm thinking of like when we all teamed up to do like Promivian or something like that in one of the expansions where it's like you had to really work as a group and to get through some of this stuff.
1191000	1195000	You know, it's kind of like, it was like a raid of sorts back in the day for that game.
1195000	1202000	And I thought that was a moment that like for me it was like, wow, this is, I don't get a moment like this in gaming really otherwise.
1202000	1208000	This is a new experience with MMOs and I'm really thankful for it. So there's that.
1208000	1217000	Let's see what else. Trying the Oculus Rift for the first time and doing that Surge demo.
1218000	1230000	You know, especially where you get, for those who haven't played it, there's a part in it where there's these giant like things walking by and that just kind of like, whoa, this is fucking cool.
1230000	1240000	And actually even with the PlayStation VR with Rush of Blood, I mean that's just, that's such an awesome game and the fact that, you know, it's come so far.
1240000	1247000	And even watching, like one of the things I was doing this week, because, you know, as I mentioned, I'm doing stuff in work, it kind of relates to gaming.
1247000	1256000	Of course, I can't really go into details on that, but I've been introducing a lot of people to VR and watching them play some of this stuff for the first time.
1256000	1265000	And just kind of like get that moment that I had where they can kind of look around like, holy shit, this is ridiculous.
1265000	1276000	I didn't realize this was a thing. I've heard about it, but to actually experience, it's like, oh my God, this is actually going to be the next big thing. It's just, that's, I love that.
1276000	1283000	Going to some comments in chat over at live.vognetwork.com. I'm sorry, I'm not going to be able to read all of these, but some things that are jumping out at me.
1283000	1294000	Vidpower in chat says, the moment I realized I'm a gamer, 100% Super Mario World. Oh my God, the first time, Christmas Day, hooking up the Super Nintendo and getting to play Super Mario World for the first time.
1294000	1305000	And it's like, I mean, the NES was another, I'm playing Super Mario Brothers, the very first one, but like playing the Super Nintendo where it was like with Mode 7 and shit, where it was like the graphics were so next level.
1305000	1307000	You know, again, for that time.
1307000	1308000	Or Super Mario 64.
1308000	1314000	Oh my God. See, I didn't really go through that because I didn't get on the Nintendo 64 bandwagon until way later.
1314000	1321000	That was kind of, there was a period, because I was around college and when I went off to college, I wasn't as into video games for a little bit.
1321000	1327000	So I kind of missed the boat with Nintendo 64, but still, I mean, yeah, I mean, I can imagine, you know, playing all that for the first time.
1327000	1332000	But, oh my God, Super Mario World was just like, blew my fucking mind with all the Mode 7 and all that.
1332000	1333000	Let's see.
1333000	1340000	SSG100Matt says, regarding the over-the-top comedy, I fell in love with the South Park Stick of Truth for the over-the-top comedy.
1340000	1342000	Yes, that's a good one. That's a good one.
1342000	1343000	Let's see.
1343000	1349000	Dungeon Buster says, flying to another planet for the first time in Phantasy Star on the Master System.
1349000	1357000	Maya said, I just finished my first playthrough of the Mass Effect trilogy and I loved how personally I took some of the choices my Shepard made.
1357000	1359000	Games can really take you places sometimes.
1359000	1366000	I mean, absolutely. I know Loki doesn't understand this the way that Dark Soccer and I do, but especially with the extended cut.
1366000	1378000	You know, because I went back and I did the original ending and it was fine and, you know, we've talked about it on the show and I'm not going to, but like, I thought the ending hysteria was way overdone and that people really blew that out of proportion.
1378000	1382000	However, I am very thankful for the extended cut because I like that even more.
1382000	1392000	And like, I think one of the most recent moments in gaming that really made me love gaming was the synthesis ending in Mass Effect extended cut.
1392000	1405000	I realize that's a controversial ending and I realize the reasons for it, but despite however you feel about the synthesis ending and what it means, I think the way it was done was so well done.
1406000	1418000	And Battlestar Galactica played six. Trisha Helfer does such a good job narrating that. That's one of my favorite voice acting performances in video games, like it all.
1418000	1425000	Speaking of voice acting, one of the biggest moments that I ever loved, the first time I played a CD-ROM game.
1425000	1436000	King's Quest 5, I think I can't remember if it was five or six, I think it was five, was on CD-ROM and like actually hearing the voice acting as I'm playing a Sierra game.
1436000	1445000	Because let me tell you, a game like King's Quest 4 was epic enough, but to play King's Quest 5 with the narration and the voice acting just mind exploded.
1445000	1447000	That was just, that was just unheard of.
1447000	1459000	Games on CD? Let's see. Akuma JP says, mine is mostly when game companies set a new bar in game technology, mostly from Square Enix.
1459000	1467000	Yeah, you want to talk Square Enix? How about the opera scene in Final Fantasy 6? That's going to resonate with me.
1467000	1475000	I mean like that was, oh my god, like I didn't know a game did this. Like that was just unheard of for games at the time.
1475000	1483000	I mean the ending for Final Fantasy 4 was so good enough, but then that happened in Final Fantasy 3 and it was like you weren't prepared for it.
1483000	1496000	My other one was, I remember it was our senior trip in high school, or maybe it was high school, junior high or high school, I think it was high school that we went to Great America.
1496000	1505000	And I don't like roller coasters, so that's fine, but I went to the arcades there and one of the games that they had there that you could pay like 5 bucks to play was Galaxian 3.
1505000	1514000	Where you go inside, it's an arcade in a room and it's just this giant screen that you're working together to shoot stuff in. That's fucking awesome.
1514000	1525000	Yeah, the whole working together for things like they do, I can't, somebody in chat will know, but the game they have all the conventions where you're doing like the Star Trek thing where everybody has their own different role that they're playing.
1525000	1526000	Bridge crew now?
1526000	1527000	Is that it? Bridge crew?
1527000	1528000	That's a new one that's coming out.
1528000	1530000	Bridge commander, something like that? Somebody in chat's got to know what it is.
1530000	1535000	Artemis! I knew the chatters, there was like 5,000 people on a row, Artemis. That's the one, yeah.
1535000	1542000	Like that is, I haven't done that yet so I can't say, oh that's a gaming moment I love, but I think that's really cool.
1542000	1552000	And in a way, something like that I think fuses the best of a Dungeons and Dragons-esque RPG with video games.
1552000	1564000	And that's why I think something like Artemis and those types of games are really cool is because I think it's really taking a lot from a gaming in a pre-video game era and how you work together in those games.
1564000	1576000	God, that would be awesome. Do they have anything like this? Like, you know, where you're playing a game, almost it could be like Diablo or something like that, where you have a DM running the game kind of outside the game.
1576000	1582000	Like you're all playing co-op in the game and there's someone DMing the game that's basically doing stuff.
1582000	1583000	So Neverwinter Nights.
1583000	1586000	Is that Neverwinter Nights? I don't know, I've never played Neverwinter Nights.
1586000	1594000	Kinda, kinda. The chat over at live.vognetwork.com, I'm loving these responses, I've got to read a few more here. Let's see.
1594000	1601000	Clever username here says, the last of us, starting the generator in the basement, so scary.
1601000	1603000	Yeah, oh man.
1603000	1606000	Oh yes, the Battletech pods, that is awesome.
1606000	1608000	Yeah, the chatters talking about that, yeah.
1608000	1614000	Maya says, the ending of Persona 3 stunned me in my chair for a solid 10 minutes, that was an incredible moment.
1615000	1623000	Vidpower says, my favorite old MMO game was playing Phantasy Star Online. Holy shit, yes, Phantasy Star Online.
1623000	1628000	Like, I can't believe I didn't think of that when I was thinking of MMOs, talking about the Final Fantasy XI thing.
1628000	1636000	But absolutely Phantasy Star Online, that was crazy how like your Dreamcast, using the modem, would call in to the Sega BBS.
1636000	1640000	No, it wasn't that, but it was like through, I don't know, American Online Connection or whatever, you were playing.
1640000	1646000	I don't even remember how it was done. Did you, did you just have to, oh you just had to call a basic internet provider, right?
1646000	1652000	You just had your internet that you called in on the Dreamcast and then you could play that online. It's crazy.
1652000	1657000	I remember back in the day when you did call a BBS to play like Doom 2.
1657000	1661000	That's how you would play, oh man, then they wanted to charge for every minute that you played.
1661000	1667000	Let's see, just a few more from our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
1667000	1673000	Bob Coffee says, Street Fighter II was the game that pretty much set me as a gamer in stone, though.
1673000	1679000	Good choice. I mean, Street Fighter II, that was the arcade scene for like the longest time, right?
1679000	1685000	I mean, I wouldn't consider myself a big fighting game aficionado, but shit, even I had my years on Street Fighter II.
1685000	1693000	Like, I distinctly remember one night, I was randomly in Southern California, I was on this bus trip with other kids my age, long story.
1693000	1700000	But we were at this, I don't remember if it was a store or what, I feel like it was a laundromat for some reason we were there.
1700000	1705000	And they had a Street Fighter II and there were these guys that were on the machine for like a long time.
1705000	1714000	And I went up and I went to play and I played as Chun-Li and they laughed because I picked Chun-Li because, you know, gamers can be jerks sometimes.
1714000	1720000	But I kicked their asses, you better believe it, I whooped them with Chun-Li over and over and over again.
1720000	1727000	Like, I won a ton of matches in a row, finally I walked away and I felt really good and I wish I could be that good at video games again.
1727000	1730000	But I'm not.
1730000	1737000	ActDeft brings up fighting games as well, playing Smash Brothers with friends, it's awesome.
1737000	1742000	Let's see, trying to get a couple more comments in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
1742000	1749000	S2100matt brings up escape rooms, which I think is also kind of like the whole D&D and gaming hybrid there.
1749000	1756000	And let's see, BlackWolf in chat says there was a Vampire the Masquerade game that had the DM mode, redemption I think.
1756000	1765000	And DarkTetsuya says he has a similar experience, my first time on Super Street Fighter II I picked Kami and just destroyed everyone.
1765000	1766000	Kami was awesome.
1766000	1773000	Super Street Fighter II was like, whoa, they redid the graphics, it looks even better and now you've got all these new people.
1773000	1774000	Blows my mind.
1774000	1777000	Anyway, that was good.
1777000	1785000	That was a good walk down memory lane and some of those reasons why, despite all this other blah that goes on in gaming sometimes, we kind of stick with it.
1785000	1790000	Because it's just these moments, these key moments that really affect us, that really make us gamers.
1790000	1792000	So thanks, thanks for walking down memory lane with us.
1793000	1798000	Although S2100matt does bring up, nobody said Qsar. Yeah, Loki, he didn't say Qsar.
1798000	1800000	Well, I didn't really consider that a game.
1800000	1802000	Qsar did have an arcade.
1802000	1806000	He did have an arcade. He had played lots of arcade games.
1806000	1810000	No, I definitely considered Qsar. I thought of it, but it's not really video games.
1810000	1812000	Yeah, it's not a video game, but certainly...
1812000	1814000	I mean, it sort of is. It's a computer game, I guess.
1814000	1816000	It's an extension, a little bit.
1816000	1820000	Alright, let's move into a little more recently.
1820000	1824000	Maybe not games you love, necessarily, but games you still played this week.
1824000	1826000	How was your gaming week, Loki? Start us off.
1826000	1828000	What kind of video games did you play this week?
1828000	1833000	So I played mainly Skyrim, still.
1833000	1835000	I mean, I'm still just plugging away at that.
1835000	1839000	I did, because I didn't really play the expansions too much when it first came out.
1839000	1842000	So I played some of the...
1842000	1846000	Well, I don't really know if you can actually do anything or quest in this, but...
1846000	1848000	It's the...
1848000	1850000	Har...
1850000	1852000	Was it called Hearthstone? I don't remember what it was called.
1852000	1855000	Basically, the house building thing in Skyrim.
1855000	1857000	So I built a house.
1857000	1862000	Because I wanted to have kind of a location that I could do all my enchanting stuff and all that.
1862000	1865000	So I have that, and then...
1865000	1869000	I did more quests in there, and just kind of playing through it some more.
1869000	1871000	Because I'm cheating, but not cheating.
1871000	1876000	I'm exploiting glitches in the vanilla game without using mods.
1876000	1880000	I'm having more fun with it than I did with mods.
1880000	1883000	Because mods were just too crazy, and it didn't work.
1883000	1886000	Well, what I put in there didn't quite work right.
1886000	1889000	I don't know, it just wasn't as fun.
1889000	1891000	So...
1891000	1893000	I did that, and then...
1893000	1895000	What else? I played...
1895000	1899000	Actually, quite a bit of PlayStation VR this week, because I've been demoing stuff, like I said.
1899000	1904000	So I got to try a little bit more Job Simulator, just for a sec.
1904000	1910000	I did Rush of Blood, and still really enjoy that game.
1910000	1912000	I played...
1912000	1917000	Pokemon Go for a little bit, because I was doing some of the Gen 2 stuff.
1917000	1922000	And I'm a little over it now, but I just caught what I could that's in the area.
1922000	1927000	Of course, now it's like 14 different things that are still around, and then that's it.
1927000	1931000	It's like, okay, well, crap. There's not really much more.
1931000	1938000	Very little Ingress. I played a few minutes of it, probably.
1938000	1940000	Anyone else?
1940000	1944000	Yeah, that was pretty much it, honestly. I didn't really get to play a whole ton.
1945000	1948000	My Gaming Week. I did some more live streaming this week.
1948000	1952000	Cheap plug for my Twitch channel over at Rob Roberts on Twitch.
1952000	1955000	But I actually did some Final Fantasy XIV.
1955000	1960000	I played some Overwatch, and I gotta say, Alan and I did some Overwatch, where he was playing with me.
1960000	1962000	And you can see him on the Twitch stream.
1962000	1965000	But we had some really good matches in Overwatch.
1965000	1968000	I ended up highlighting it and putting it on YouTube.
1968000	1970000	I loved the match so much.
1970000	1978000	It was one of those things where the enemy had the thing at 99%, and we ended up in an overtime that went on for minutes.
1978000	1982000	And finally, we took the point, and we ended up winning that particular match.
1982000	1985000	It was quite the turnaround, and that was in Mystery Heroes.
1985000	1988000	So I think I had Mei or somebody I don't usually play.
1988000	1990000	But yeah, it was a lot of fun.
1990000	1992000	I had some really good moments in Overwatch this week.
1992000	1996000	And then some bad moments, too, because today I was playing with friends, and we were not winning anything.
1996000	1998000	But Mystery Heroes can be such a crapshoot.
1998000	2003000	It's like if you just get the wrong comp, you're not getting any tanks or any healers.
2003000	2006000	It can just be a disaster.
2006000	2009000	So Mystery Heroes is a crapshoot in that regard.
2009000	2013000	But it's still fun to play with friends, and that's the important thing, am I right?
2013000	2016000	So I've been playing those games a bit.
2016000	2021000	Let's see, continuing on with some of the other standbys as well.
2021000	2026000	But one of the games I did play this week that I was randomly getting into, I suppose.
2026000	2030000	Do you remember how last week I talked about that I was randomly playing Oblivion?
2030000	2032000	Because it was on the Xbox 360 backwards compatibility.
2032000	2034000	So wish I had remastered that, because that'd be awesome.
2034000	2037000	Well, you need to check out what Alan does with the mods.
2037000	2040000	Well, yeah, I know. I can do that on my PC.
2040000	2043000	I think I have Oblivion on my PC. I don't know if I have it.
2043000	2046000	He spent like three days setting up mods in Oblivion.
2046000	2048000	And now I watch him, and I'm like, it doesn't even look like the same game.
2048000	2052000	Like, I know it's Oblivion, but it looks even better. Like, it's gorgeous. Like, my god.
2052000	2054000	Like, I don't have a laptop that supports it.
2054000	2059000	It's funny, I was actually working on my coworker's laptop the other day,
2059000	2065000	and he has a new MSI laptop that's like an i7 with a GTX 980 inside there.
2065000	2068000	I'm like, shit, man, I need to get a new laptop.
2068000	2074000	Fuck this Asus shit. I'll just go with an MSI one, because those are some nice-looking laptops.
2075000	2078000	And then I can do all that cool shit.
2078000	2085000	Right now, though, this fucking Radeon fucking AMD is my only choice at the time,
2085000	2088000	because I want a dedicated GPU, and they're very minimal.
2088000	2093000	Price-wise, it's affordable, but fuck, I miss my GeForce.
2093000	2096000	So I actually did end up playing a little more Oblivion, even.
2096000	2099000	I ended up closing the first Rift, which is part of the story and all that stuff,
2099000	2101000	so I played a little further.
2101000	2107000	But then I was like, why am I sitting here playing Oblivion when I still have yet to really play Skyrim?
2107000	2111000	I take that back, because I did play Skyrim quite a bit, but I didn't really finish it,
2111000	2116000	and I didn't do any of the expansion stuff, so there's a lot more I could do in Skyrim.
2116000	2118000	And I went on Amazon, just out of the blue, and I checked.
2118000	2120000	I was like, how much do they want for Skyrim Special Edition?
2120000	2124000	I was like, oh, shit. It's on sale for 30 bucks.
2124000	2128000	All right. You win. You won this time.
2128000	2133000	So I bought Skyrim Special Edition on Xbox One, and I opted to get the Xbox One version,
2133000	2138000	because the mod support is a little better on Xbox One, right?
2138000	2143000	So the first thing I did when I got it, and I got the game yesterday, and I finally went in to check it out.
2143000	2149000	I didn't realize you needed a Bethesda.net account, which you can't sign up in the game.
2149000	2153000	You have to bring up your phone or go on the website. That's what I had to do.
2153000	2155000	It's a little silly, but whatever.
2155000	2163000	And then I started looking at the mods, and I was like, there's nothing really in here I think I want to install right now.
2163000	2169000	Well, and then the other thing is, it makes very clear that if you use the mods, you can't get any achievements.
2169000	2175000	And I was like, oh, well, let me play a little bit vanilla to get some achievements,
2175000	2181000	and then maybe I'll look at some of these graphic improvement mods and some of the other things they're talking about.
2181000	2186000	But I gotta say, having not played Skyrim in a long time, but now playing Special Edition for the first time finally,
2186000	2191000	on my big TV that does the 60 frames a second and all that, it does look really good.
2191000	2194000	Skyrim Special Edition does look really, really good.
2194000	2198000	And it makes me excited for what they might do with an Elder Scrolls VI.
2198000	2202000	It's gotta happen someday, right? It's gotta happen. It might not be this year, but next year or something.
2202000	2204000	They gotta do an Elder Scrolls VI at some point, right?
2204000	2208000	So it makes me very excited if Skyrim kind of looks that good.
2208000	2210000	And how old is it? I mean, it's several years old.
2210000	2213000	But obviously they've gone through and they've bumped up a lot of the graphics.
2213000	2218000	But if you haven't seen it yourself yet, it is worth a look.
2218000	2222000	It depends on what kind of games you're into, if I would recommend you just jump in and buy it or what have you.
2222000	2224000	I think you should. I mean, honestly, I've spent...
2224000	2226000	How many times have I replayed through Skyrim? Several times.
2226000	2229000	And you never actually finished the game.
2229000	2233000	But I spent hundreds and hundreds of hours in that game.
2233000	2236000	It's definitely worth 30 bucks. I mean, come on.
2236000	2243000	Okay, I gotta respond to this little... I'm detecting a little bit of tone in this comment in our chat over at live.vognetware.com.
2243000	2245000	A clever username here in chat says,
2245000	2248000	Looking for best mod support, buys console version.
2248000	2250000	Now, hold on a minute.
2250000	2254000	Alan owns it on PC and we can do the whole Steam library share thing.
2254000	2258000	So there is that. And I do own the original Skyrim on PC,
2258000	2262000	but I didn't get the upgrade that just upgraded it for free to the newer version.
2262000	2264000	If I wanted to do that, I could do it through Alan's account.
2264000	2266000	Well, you didn't own the DLC on the...
2266000	2268000	No, I didn't own all the DLC and that's why I didn't get the free one.
2268000	2270000	But Alan did do that.
2270000	2274000	But, sometimes, you just want to plop your ass on the couch,
2274000	2276000	play the game with a controller,
2276000	2281000	and zone in on the big 60 inch TV, which is way bigger than even my dual screen monitors are.
2281000	2284000	So, I think there's some things to be said for the console experience.
2284000	2286000	And I just, yeah, I wanted to just play it on console.
2286000	2291000	But I'm not, you know, not saying there isn't a lot of good stuff going on on PC,
2291000	2297000	because obviously, you know, if you want to talk to Alan about how much he's modded Skyrim, it's insane.
2297000	2300000	And it's also, like, having done both,
2300000	2304000	there could be a little bit of setup required with the PC version versus the console.
2304000	2306000	Console's more like you just toggle that shit on.
2306000	2308000	Granted, you can't do as much.
2308000	2313000	But after a while, you just, you know, you get tired of seeing all the bare-breasted and floppy dongs
2313000	2315000	and, like, Thomas the Tank Engine.
2315000	2318000	Are you sure? Are you sure you can get tired of that?
2319000	2322000	Where's that stuff on Xbox One? I didn't see the...
2322000	2323000	They don't have...
2323000	2325000	They don't have the Macho Man thing where the dragon comes out?
2325000	2327000	I thought they had that already. I do think they have that.
2327000	2330000	That would almost be worth giving up achievements for.
2330000	2334000	And, like, Battletoads and, like, you can play as, like, all these different followers.
2334000	2338000	I saw the one that was, they did have this on Xbox One.
2338000	2343000	It was, like, The Temple of Time featuring the Hyrelian Sword.
2343000	2348000	Like, they changed the name just enough so that, like, we're not completely ripping off The Legend of Zelda,
2348000	2350000	but we totes are.
2350000	2352000	Like, even in the graphics and everything.
2352000	2355000	So, when I do get into mods, I want to check out, like,
2355000	2358000	I want to check out the really, like, terrible rip-off stuff like that.
2358000	2364000	Or, my favorite on PC was the dubstep spell.
2364000	2366000	The dubstep gun spell. It was awesome.
2366000	2370000	He's just like, he casts that and everybody explodes.
2370000	2371000	That's Saints Row IV, right?
2371000	2373000	There's another moment I love.
2373000	2375000	The dubstep gun. I mean, that's awesome.
2375000	2377000	It's so stupid and ridiculous.
2377000	2379000	They're just like any of the guns they have.
2379000	2381000	They're shark gun. I mean, chum gun.
2381000	2383000	Or the giant purple dildo bat. Hello.
2383000	2385000	Giant purple dildo bat. Yeah, absolutely.
2385000	2388000	Zeba brings up Charizard dragons.
2388000	2391000	Is that a thing? Of course. It's got to be a thing you can do in Skyrim.
2391000	2393000	Of course. Of course. It's on the internet. It's got to be.
2393000	2395000	So, you can just change all the dragons to Charizard.
2395000	2398000	It's like, what is it? The Tommy Wiseau horse and stuff that you can get.
2399000	2401000	It's weird.
2401000	2403000	Oh, hi horse.
2403000	2405000	It's weird.
2405000	2408000	There's some weird shit.
2408000	2410000	That's amazing.
2410000	2412000	Alright, anyway, I guess that's really it for my gaming week.
2412000	2415000	I played a little Skyrim and I mentioned all the other stuff.
2415000	2418000	So, I'll try to play a little more Skyrim as the week goes on.
2418000	2422000	Anyway, let's get into some gaming news, of which there's a lot this week.
2422000	2425000	Because I don't have a lot of announcements or other housekeeping to talk about.
2425000	2429000	Besides, I guess I can always plug our Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
2429000	2432000	We're also on Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
2432000	2434000	So, you know, follow us on social media.
2434000	2437000	Let's get into news. There's a little bit going on this week, right, Logie?
2437000	2440000	Yeah, there's been some video of the Nintendo Switch coming out.
2440000	2443000	Well, how's that? Is Nintendo releasing some video?
2443000	2448000	No, they're not. Because, allegedly, one leaked out. Allegedly.
2448000	2454000	According to Nintendo, earlier this week, individuals claimed to prematurely purchase a small number of Nintendo Switch systems.
2454000	2460000	From an unspecified retailer. Nintendo has determined these units were stolen in an isolated instance.
2460000	2466000	By employees of a U.S. distributor with one system being legally resold.
2466000	2470000	The individuals involved here have been identified, terminated from their place of employment.
2470000	2475000	And are under investigation by local law enforcement authorities on criminal charges.
2475000	2478000	And the Switch will be launching on March 3rd.
2478000	2481000	Okay, I've been dying to ask you this question all week.
2481000	2485000	You used to work in video game distribution. You don't anymore. You've changed industries big time.
2485000	2491000	But, what, like, is this, like, could somebody have done this?
2491000	2496000	No. And the reason no one could have done this is because we don't get it, you wouldn't get them that early.
2496000	2504000	They, let's play this way. In the world of retail and game sales, distributors are in the fucking bottom.
2504000	2507000	Aside from independent retailers. They're below them.
2507000	2516000	But, seriously, they're not getting that product until as early as possible to street, or as close to street as possible.
2516000	2524000	So, for example, this is coming out March 3rd. Most likely, I think, if I'm correct here, March 3rd is probably a Friday.
2524000	2530000	Yes, it's a Friday. So, most likely, they would be getting that product on the 1st.
2530000	2536000	And the reason for that is because they are fucking paranoid about this.
2536000	2543000	They're fucking paranoid of this. And they would never, ever ship that fucking early.
2543000	2547000	Especially Nintendo. They'd be lucky to get any at all.
2547000	2551000	But, to be fair, things may have changed since you left the industry.
2551000	2555000	And did you say something about, like, a GameStop distribution could be different?
2555000	2563000	It could maybe if, you know, they're shipping to GameStop. Although, I wouldn't think, you know, maybe they're shipping to their main distribution center and then it's going out from there.
2564000	2574000	That could possibly be, you know, a situation where they'd ship earlier, but for an independent distributor, there is no fucking way they're getting it that early.
2574000	2582000	No way. There's no reason to do that. They wouldn't ship that early and just have it sit on shelves because they know there's too much temptation to break street.
2582000	2588000	There's all these possible things that could go wrong. Which makes me think, they did this themselves.
2588000	2590000	As some sort of viral marketing.
2590000	2594000	That's a hell of a claim, Loki. That's a hell of a claim.
2594000	2599000	Because I just, I don't buy that this is how this stuff got out.
2599000	2610000	But, I just, okay, like, I, my thought is, and you know, this is a very complicated story here where, you know, obviously the person who leaked it is not being 100% truthful.
2610000	2616000	And has kind of got caught on a few things, right? Like, wasn't there like a Reddit post where they were trying to flip it? Like, sell it or something like that?
2616000	2618000	There's all this, there's all this kind of like shady stuff going on.
2618000	2621000	It's very possible that they got it somewhere, but I just don't think-
2621000	2627000	But a viral thing, Loki? I don't, like, why can't Nintendo just answer these fucking questions? Or put out a video themselves?
2627000	2633000	I think a lot of, I think something like that would go much more viral than this NeoGaf post.
2633000	2638000	Which, yes, went viral, but I think if Nintendo did a direct, way more people would see it.
2638000	2643000	And they could just say, here's what you've been waiting to see, here's what the Switch interface looks like, and here's what's going to look like day one.
2644000	2653000	I don't know. I just, I find it hard to believe that this was from a distributor. Just because, like I said, they don't get product that early. Ever. Ever.
2653000	2658000	So something that, that part of the story doesn't add up to you and it kind of just throws-
2658000	2665000	I just know Nintendo. I've been through two console launches with them. 14 years in the industry, okay?
2665000	2673000	It's not, and I can tell you from 14, well okay, we haven't, we weren't selling games for 14 years, but for at least 5 years of that.
2673000	2680000	Maybe it was more than that, but at least 5 years. Never once have we gotten a console that early.
2680000	2690000	Never. Ever. From any Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo, never happened. Never. There'd be no way that they would do that.
2691000	2696000	Now my assumption was, when I heard about all this, is that it was a press thing that got into the wrong hands.
2696000	2701000	That I could believe if it got, like if someone leaked out their press kit or something, because I know the press have them now.
2701000	2711000	Yeah, and I'm not talking about like video game sites even, because when we say the press, that could even be things like the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, you know.
2711000	2712000	That would be more plausible.
2712000	2718000	I would think, oh you're using my word, that I think something like that would make a lot of sense.
2718000	2728000	Or maybe it was where it was somebody sweet talking somebody, some sort of employee who didn't know better at one of these journalist's place that isn't gaming.
2728000	2729000	Does that make sense?
2729000	2730000	Yeah.
2730000	2736000	Like sweet talking somebody who maybe like they get a switch, but their main dig isn't really games.
2737000	2746000	Like I don't know if that makes sense, but maybe it was a way that these guys sweet talked it or flat out stole it potentially, I mean potentially, or whatever you want to believe here.
2746000	2747000	I've seen situations I don't-
2747000	2749000	Which is why Nintendo would be able to recall it back so easily.
2749000	2757000	Well they could track it probably by the serial number if they were showing like the internal screens and stuff like that, they may be able to pull a serial number from that.
2757000	2768000	But I would think that the other one I've seen too is like it was somebody's child that was like putting up the videos or something like that, not necessarily like a teenager or something like that.
2768000	2772000	Because I remember something happened like that I want to see with like the Xbox 360 or-
2772000	2777000	Yeah, or that's even happened with, okay, remember there was this really controversial case.
2777000	2784000	There was this older actor, and I don't remember the guy's name, but I think he played a lot of like mobster type characters in movies.
2784000	2796000	And he leaked a bunch of Oscar screeners, and that's how like Pirate Bay and some of those websites were getting copies of movies that were crystal clear quality while these things were still in theaters.
2796000	2804000	And this guy ended up getting kicked out of the Motion Picture Society or whoever it is that does the voting in the Oscars.
2804000	2814000	This guy was kicked out of it and he didn't even really, like this guy was an older guy who probably had no idea, who probably thought he was loaning these to his kid to watch the movie.
2814000	2819000	Because I think a lot of people that get video screeners loan them to friends to watch, right, Loki?
2819000	2821000	I'm guilty of that, yes, absolutely.
2821000	2824000	So, but you didn't rip them and put them on the internet, so you-
2824000	2826000	No, that's work. I don't want to do work.
2826000	2831000	Yeah, you weren't at risk like this other poor guy. Do you guys remember that? Like, I'm not crazy, right? That happened, right?
2831000	2838000	So maybe you've got something like that. I would believe that a heck of a lot more than I do. Nintendo did it for viral marketing.
2838000	2844000	Okay, well maybe, okay, yeah, maybe that's a little stretch, but I find it hard to believe, though, that the source from this was a U.S. distributor.
2844000	2850000	Because that would be just like unheard of that, oh hey, all of a sudden we decided that, oh, we do trust you guys and we're going to go ahead and do this.
2850000	2856000	Fuck that. They don't trust anybody at all because there's no way to hold them accountable for that stuff.
2856000	2861000	And we would again do take away the three units that they're going to get as a whole. I mean, it's just not going to happen.
2861000	2871000	Kaijuto in chat says, that guy was named Al Pacino. No, it was not Al Pacino. It was somebody else. It was not, it was not, like, I think it was one of those people like, you know, there's these people in movies.
2871000	2875000	You don't know their names, but you know their face. And you're like, it's that guy.
2875000	2883000	It's like when my good friend Billy and I went to see some movie and he gasped in the middle of it and went, she shot Selena.
2883000	2892000	Because it was the actress who played the crazed fan club member in the Selena movie. Like, there's always that face, right, that you recognize in movies.
2892000	2897000	Okay? Joe Pesci is another one of these guys, right? Even though we know his name.
2898000	2904000	Anyways, so aside from that, yeah, they were showing off, you know, with this league now that we've kind of gone past that.
2904000	2912000	There's been YouTube videos that have gone up showing the Switch's menu system, storage specs, the UI, that type of stuff.
2912000	2917000	And apparently the internal storage is 25.9 gigabytes, at least that's what's usable from that.
2917000	2925000	Some other stuff, of course, they're saying that apparently the eShop purchases are going to be tied to an online account on the Switch.
2925000	2930000	Which makes me wonder, I thought that was the case with the Wii U and the 3DS. So you're saying that's not the case?
2930000	2936000	So I can't transfer my shit that I've basically been purchasing all digital on the Wii U to the Switch when I eventually get it?
2936000	2941000	Thanks, Nintendo. I appreciate your forward thinking and network design.
2944000	2951000	Yeah, so that's interesting, but I just, I'm very skeptical.
2952000	2959000	Clever username here in chat says, the menus looked very barren. I'm not sure what I expected to be there, but there wasn't much.
2959000	2965000	This is not going to be final either, right? There's going to be a day one update. There has to be.
2965000	2968000	Probably. There's going to be a day one patch, probably.
2968000	2974000	And it could be major. The Wii U's, if I remember right, the Wii U got a major day one patch.
2974000	2978000	Yeah, I remember that because everyone complained that they had to wait a long time to be able to play anything on it.
2978000	2983000	Be ready on Friday, you guys. You might not get into Zelda right away.
2983000	2987000	Just don't connect your system to the network, maybe.
2987000	2994000	If you want to play that bad. I kind of think you should connect and just get the current stuff because it'll be guaranteed.
2994000	2998000	Because for all we know, Zelda could crash on the other, you know, you should probably update it.
2998000	3007000	But anyway, I don't know. This is complicated because there definitely is a part of me, like I certainly don't want to say Nintendo had it coming or Nintendo deserved it or anything like that.
3007000	3011000	Because the stolen shit is not cool. Like, that's not cool.
3011000	3018000	But I, you know, okay, this was inevitable. It was going to leak once the press kits get out.
3018000	3023000	You know, now that we know the press kits are out, because didn't Kotaku or one of those sites like flat out confirm they have a press kit?
3023000	3026000	Yeah, I think one of them did. Somebody was tweeting and I know that.
3026000	3031000	So we know the press kits are out. So this information was going to get out eventually in one way or another.
3031000	3034000	Again, I'm not endorsing the stolen shit. That's not cool.
3034000	3044000	But Nintendo could fix a lot of this by answering some very basic questions about what is planned for the launch of the Switch.
3044000	3051000	Or producing one of these videos themselves or doing a direct that's an unboxing where they can control the conversation.
3051000	3055000	And it really blows my fucking mind that Nintendo hasn't done it yet.
3055000	3057000	Two weeks away from launch.
3057000	3064000	I know. Here's the reality. I still have my Switch on pre-order. I'm excited to play it. That's not going to change.
3064000	3071000	But what I've told myself is you need to set the bar very low for this system the first day.
3071000	3079000	Because this is looking more and more what the reality is, is Nintendo is doing the real launch of this system for the holiday.
3079000	3086000	And this is the soft launch to try to sell some copies to the diehard fans so they can bump up the numbers a little bit this fiscal year, which is fine.
3086000	3093000	But what I mean with that is that I am not going to expect Virtual Console is there day one. I don't think it's going to be there.
3093000	3101000	At this point, they have not answered the questions and I think they don't want the conversation to be about how Virtual Console is missing.
3101000	3103000	So my assumption is it's not there.
3103000	3109000	And okay, I don't see how we go years and years without there ever being Virtual Console.
3109000	3113000	And if I remember right, Wii U didn't have Virtual Console at first either.
3113000	3121000	They brought that in later with the whole 30th birthday of something and they sold the balloon fight for 30 cents.
3121000	3123000	That was like the first Virtual Console game, right?
3123000	3131000	I don't think Virtual Console existed before that. I could be wrong, but even if I'm right or wrong, it doesn't matter.
3131000	3135000	The reality is the Wii U is probably not going to have Virtual Console the first day.
3135000	3139000	That's what I'm preparing myself for. In fact, it's probably not going to have a lot the first day.
3140000	3146000	It may not even have the online play ready to go the first day because do any of the launch titles need it?
3146000	3148000	No, I don't think any have online play.
3148000	3152000	So I'm prepared that there's no online whatsoever the first day.
3152000	3160000	Well, they're probably going to need to figure out something because they've got that stupid beta test for Splatoon, so something's got to...
3160000	3162000	Well, they've got a good three weeks to figure that out.
3162000	3166000	Again, I don't think Nintendo is completely pulling it out their ass.
3166000	3171000	They have a roadmap, but I do think that roadmap works right up until the very last minute.
3171000	3176000	Yeah, they probably shouldn't be putting the tires on the car while the car is starting the roll, you know what I mean?
3176000	3184000	YYR in chat says, yes Rob, that was right. Virtual Console on Wii U launched with 30 cent titles once a month for I think eight months.
3184000	3186000	Yep, that's right. Let's see.
3186000	3193000	YYR says, I think folks who preordered Switch are going to be bored by day seven or they're going to be cheerleaders for the system, one or the other.
3194000	3199000	Now on the flip side of that, Doom Plague says, I will take more than seven days to finish Zelda for most people.
3199000	3207000	And here's where Nintendo should be thanking BioWare for plopping a Mass Effect game out three weeks after the launch of the Switch,
3207000	3210000	because I'll be able to just overlook the...
3210000	3215000	But at the same time, my Switch probably will not be played while I'm focusing on Mass Effect Andromeda.
3215000	3219000	In my mind, I have like, what, three weeks to beat that Zelda game before Andromeda's out.
3219000	3223000	It would have been ideal if that was a launch title for the Switch. Too bad it can't run it.
3224000	3234000	But anyway, so my point is, I'm setting the bar very, very, very low for what the Switch is going to be able to do on day one.
3234000	3239000	And I really don't think we're going to be able to accurately judge this system until mid-November.
3239000	3243000	I think when they really go into overdrive to sell systems, it's going to be holiday.
3243000	3248000	And I think holiday will be when they inevitably bundle one, two Switch with the system.
3248000	3250000	Oh, fuck that. No, fuck that.
3250000	3255000	Mark, I'm telling you, it's what's going to happen. There will be a holiday bundle, and they'll include one, two Switch.
3255000	3256000	I don't want that fucking garbage.
3256000	3258000	Like we're saying they should have done now.
3258000	3259000	That game is fucking shit.
3259000	3262000	Then sell it back to whatever company.
3262000	3264000	No, it's garbage. Fuck that.
3264000	3267000	But you haven't played it yet. In a party situation.
3268000	3275000	You know what? I can look at a piece of shit on the ground and know what that probably smells like without actually going up to it.
3276000	3285000	So you're saying you don't get fun when you play Mario Party in a big group, or Wii Sports even in a fun group, or shit, even Nintendo Land with a group of people. It was no fun whatsoever.
3286000	3288000	Dude, have you seen one, two Switch?
3288000	3289000	I have.
3289000	3292000	Tech demo fucking city here. There is no game.
3292000	3297000	Let me put it this way. I don't plan on buying it. And I do think it was a mistake for them not to bundle it in.
3297000	3302000	But I'm not going to completely trash it when I haven't played it myself yet.
3303000	3315000	I'm going to put it this way. The fucking games that they had bundled in with the PlayStation VR, like the free playroom stuff, is more robust than this fucking one, two Switch shit.
3316000	3317000	And that was free.
3317000	3318000	Alright.
3318000	3323000	I'm not... $50? I mean are they fucking out of their mind?
3323000	3327000	I think some of these launch titles and what they're charging for are...
3327000	3337000	You know what it is? It's because it's like, after you get done with Zelda, and let's say that there's like 100 hours worth of gameplay there, okay?
3337000	3341000	So after a month you get done with Zelda or whatever, and Mario Kart's still not out yet.
3341000	3344000	It's like, well shit, I need to buy some other games for the Switch here.
3345000	3355000	Fine, I'll try one, two Switch I guess because, you know, it could be fun. It's a party thing. That's how they're selling it. It's because there's nothing else.
3356000	3363000	Come on Noel Gustin, our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says $20 says that Sky buys one, two Switch before April.
3363000	3366000	You're on with that bet, because that's not going to happen.
3366000	3372000	And when I get the $20, I'll be able to buy it out of a bargain bin during the holiday season.
3373000	3379000	Ha! That's hilarious that you assume that Nintendo actually drops the price of their games ever, even if they do suck.
3380000	3381000	That's hilarious.
3381000	3383000	They do like three years after the fact.
3383000	3389000	No they don't. They never drop their prices of their games because they're Nintendo and we're quality and we're going to keep those fucking prices up. No.
3390000	3399000	Well, we're less than two weeks away from the launch of the Switch now, and I think the reality is what you saw in this leaked video is all you're going to get until whenever the press embargo is up.
3400000	3404000	Do we know what day the press gets to talk about their hands on with the Switch? Do we know what day that is?
3404000	3405000	Nope.
3405000	3411000	That's not out there. So that could be the day of, or it could be the day before, or it could be, who knows, up to a week before.
3411000	3424000	But we'll get a lot of chatter, I'm sure, from the press because they're not going to stay quiet on what they see inside the shell system and all that stuff and what they are and aren't seeing with whatever press patches Nintendo might be doing.
3424000	3432000	Because Nintendo could still push a patch before the embargo is up so the press has to play catch up a little bit. That could still happen. We'll see.
3432000	3444000	All right. Anyhow, let's move on. We've got to move on to other stories and, you know, because eventually we want to get your phone calls and see what you think about all this stuff at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word, on Skype.
3445000	3455000	But one of the other titles for the Nintendo Switch, which is Ultra Street Fighter II, which is kind of, you know, the definitive, I suppose, Street Fighter II version that they're doing.
3456000	3468000	We were wondering why in this trailer for Ultra Street Fighter II was there suddenly this weird first person mode where you could see Ryu throwing a fireball all of a sudden.
3468000	3474000	Like, was this just something they put together for the trailer? Was it a cinematic? Was it like a Street Fighter IV thing? What the hell was it?
3474000	3493000	Well, it turns out that, yeah, this is actually some new mode that's in this game. In an episode of Capcom TV, they showcased this new mode called Way of the Hadu, which looks like, I guess it's supposed to be like one of those arcade shooter things, like House of the Dead type of things.
3493000	3505000	So you actually are going through on rails and shooting fireballs at things. You fling your little Joy-Con controller to do the fireball and you uppercut and spin kick the Shadaloo Grunts.
3505000	3509000	So it's a silly extra party mode thing.
3509000	3514000	Are we really doing this now? Is Nintendo forcing Waggle on people again?
3515000	3527000	Do you know what this says to me? Do you know what this screams to me? Do you remember in Star Wars Connect how they had the dance mode, because it had to have a dance mode to show off the connect? That's what this is kind of screaming to me.
3527000	3543000	This system is the fucking Wii U again. Literally up to the very last title coming out on this thing. It's like, honestly, the second screen thing is, it's worth it. This is important. This is why we put out the console, because it has tilt controls and stuff.
3543000	3556000	They're still fucking trying to convince you why tilt controls are fucking necessary. It's not necessary in Street Fighter. Yeah, it's a neat little extra thing to throw in there, but oh my god, it's completely unnecessary.
3557000	3566000	Bob Coffee in chat says the Wii U never got Street Fighter though, lol. It didn't even get Street Fighter IV. No, I guess it didn't, did it? I'm thinking 3DS.
3566000	3575000	You can't run Street Fighter IV. No, the 3DS can run Street Fighter IV, come on. They could do Street Fighter IV on the Wii U. But yeah, I guess they didn't really have a version of Street Fighter there.
3575000	3582000	Anyway, this is just one of those like, okay, cool story, but it's not something that is gonna sell me a copy of this game, that's for sure.
3582000	3589000	And what I hope they're not trying to do is justify why they're gonna charge 40 bucks for this. Do we know how much they're charging for old Street Fighter II?
3589000	3598000	The game that was $20 on Xbox Live, not that long ago? Because if they're trying to use this to justify 40 bucks, nice try.
3598000	3606000	I'll be picking this up out of the bargain bin when I get my $20 reward for that bet from earlier.
3607000	3616000	Let's see. I mean, don't get me wrong, I love Street Fighter II, and I like what the Switch as a platform can do for that with multiplayer.
3616000	3629000	Yeah, the retail version of the game is gonna be priced at 4990 yen, which is around $43. A digital edition is gonna launch at 4620 yen, or $40. It's a $40 game.
3629000	3633000	So it's a $40 game. No thanks. No. Not happening.
3633000	3645000	Yeah, this is, there's, see, here's the thing. A lot of you might say that we keep shitting on Nintendo, but the problem is there's just all these like, uh-oh things that are going on.
3645000	3648000	It is a fucking cash grab. That is a fucking cash grab.
3648000	3650000	Uh-oh.
3651000	3661000	Don't get me wrong, Street Fighter II is fun and all, but are we really selling a $40 Street Fighter II game, what, like decades after Street Fighter II was a big thing?
3661000	3667000	I mean, shit, put, I'll tell you what, just put Street Fighter II out in virtual, oh, that's right, virtual consoles, I could be there at launch.
3667000	3670000	My mistake, how, why would I even think that that would be a thing?
3670000	3671000	You're such an ass.
3671000	3672000	But no, seriously though, just wait.
3672000	3683000	No, I get it. I get it. It's, it's one of those things where, you know, again, I think Ultra Street Fighter II's biggest perk is what the Switch is as a platform.
3683000	3690000	It's the whole reason why, you know, despite this negative talk right now, there are still things I do get excited about with the Switch.
3690000	3705000	And I've said this before on the show, but it's Mario Kart 8 when I'm going to be able to just take my system to the next convention and we all can sit there in a hotel room and we all play Mario Kart 8 on our, like, little screens like we were playing it at home or whatever.
3705000	3707000	Like, that's going to be badass.
3707000	3712000	So they're selling you on potential. Okay, well, I hope that's how it actually turns out. I'm just...
3712000	3717000	I have no reason to believe it wouldn't, considering this is the whole crux of what the system is supposed to be.
3717000	3721000	Okay, well, I hope it's worth how many other conventions you go to a year.
3721000	3723000	We'll see. I think so.
3723000	3728000	That's a lot to drop on a system for a game that you could play on a system you already have.
3728000	3729000	I'm not saying necessarily...
3729000	3731000	For the potential that, you know...
3731000	3733000	It's not going to be limited to those two games, you know it.
3735000	3740000	I just... I hope the system doesn't die out before they actually get those games out.
3740000	3742000	ActDeftInChat says Splatoon 2.
3742000	3744000	Of course, this system is not going to die out before they...
3744000	3747000	They're going to get the Mario game out this holiday, but I do...
3747000	3751000	I do think the holiday is going to be very much a make or break thing for Nintendo.
3751000	3757000	Like, if Nintendo does not impress people with the holiday sales figures, it's going to be bad.
3759000	3761000	Nintendo may have to fall back on the 3DS, and that's that.
3761000	3764000	Nintendo may not... And the mobile development, and that may be...
3764000	3769000	That may be it for consoles from Nintendo, which is a crazy thing to be saying, I know.
3769000	3771000	They need to put out a fucking console that's spec...
3771000	3773000	They need to put one out that's spec-wise.
3773000	3775000	Do... Pull a fucking GameCube.
3775000	3779000	Put a console out that's spec, you know, comparable to other consoles,
3779000	3782000	and then you're not going to have a problem with third-party support,
3782000	3785000	and you can still put out games that are fucking nice.
3785000	3787000	Stop relying on fucking gimmicks.
3787000	3789000	DoomPlagueInChat says,
3789000	3792000	The software lineup in the first year will be light, like, you know, every other console,
3792000	3795000	but every other console launched in November,
3795000	3797000	where you could kind of get away with that a little differently.
3797000	3799000	And there'd be third-party support, too, like...
3799000	3801000	And also, I do want to be fair,
3801000	3803000	because there's these graphics floating around out there
3803000	3805000	that show you what is going to be out in the first year,
3805000	3810000	and to be fair, there are a lot of games that are coming out in this first year.
3810000	3813000	My concern is that many of them already exist onto their platforms,
3813000	3817000	and it didn't work for the Wii U, and I don't know why it's going to work here,
3817000	3821000	unless the portability aspect is that big of a seller,
3821000	3824000	which for a multiplayer experience, I personally think it will be.
3825000	3828000	For something like Skyrim, I don't think it will be.
3828000	3830000	But that's my opinion,
3830000	3835000	and ultimately it will be the sales of those that want that
3835000	3837000	that are going to really drive this conversation.
3837000	3840000	I just hope it's not a $60 game by the time it comes out,
3840000	3842000	because that's ridiculous at that point.
3842000	3845000	We'll see what happens. Anyway, I do want to move on.
3845000	3848000	We've got other stuff to talk about as well that happened this week.
3848000	3850000	Not just Switch stuff, right, Loki?
3850000	3853000	No, and speaking of Skyrim, actually,
3853000	3857000	there's been an update to Skyrim, which adds some limitations.
3857000	3861000	Now, I don't think these limitations are necessarily a bad thing,
3861000	3866000	because I don't really see where you'd be running this many mods at one time,
3866000	3871000	but they have a limit now on Fallout 4 and Skyrim.
3871000	3877000	On the Xbox One, you're only going to be able to have 150 mods active at one time.
3877000	3883000	You can install more mods, but you can only have 150 max enabled at one time.
3883000	3885000	PlayStation 4, you can only have 100.
3885000	3889000	Honestly, when I was running with mods, I maybe had 8 or 10.
3889000	3890000	You're not going to...
3890000	3892000	150 is a lot.
3892000	3893000	You're not going to...
3893000	3895000	Unless you're Alan. Then that's just normal.
3895000	3899000	Well, don't get me wrong. On PC, there's a lot of visual graphic improvement mods you can do,
3899000	3902000	but on PlayStation 4, it's all fucking stats and shit,
3902000	3905000	and I can't honestly see where you would even run that many.
3905000	3910000	Even on PC, I think running that many, that's pretty taxing.
3910000	3916000	That's just asking for trouble, because stuff conflicts with other things.
3916000	3922000	You need to re-evaluate your life if you're running 100 mods on Skyrim on console.
3922000	3925000	I mean, seriously.
3925000	3930000	There weren't even 100 in there that looked like I wanted to install.
3930000	3934000	Exactly. I think that's fine, but I can see why they're doing that,
3934000	3938000	because I would just crash that game like shit.
3938000	3940000	I mean, I don't know.
3940000	3943000	You know, I didn't mention this during my gaming weekend.
3943000	3944000	It's important.
3944000	3945000	Kaishido in chat says,
3945000	3948000	I can anything from Bethesda up late.
3948000	3950000	They never patch shit on time.
3950000	3955000	Yeah, you know, I got to say, there's still some bugs in Skyrim Special Edition.
3955000	3956000	There's quite a bit of bugs in Skyrim.
3956000	3960000	That are kind of a little ridiculous with how old this game is now, right?
3960000	3962000	And isn't there actually one of the biggest mods?
3962000	3965000	I think the most popular mod on Xbox One right now is like,
3965000	3968000	this is the Skyrim update that Bethesda won't do.
3968000	3969000	Yeah, the unofficial patch.
3969000	3970000	Yeah, the unofficial patch.
3970000	3971000	It's like the number one thing.
3971000	3974000	And I can't install it, because it's going to bork the achievements thing,
3974000	3977000	which I would like to just for fun try to get some of those.
3977000	3980000	I don't think I'm going to put the pedal to the metal, try to get them all.
3980000	3981000	I'll probably install mods before then,
3981000	3985000	but it's a little silly that the fan community has to fix it.
3985000	3987000	That is one of the pluses of the PC community,
3987000	3991000	where you can just do that and there's nothing they can do about it.
3991000	3995000	Unless, of course, you use their official routes to modding the game.
3995000	3998000	Alright, let's see.
3998000	4000000	Moving on to another story.
4000000	4001000	I guess this one's also about the Switch,
4001000	4004000	but it's about another event that's also happening this weekend.
4004000	4008000	So Final Fantasy XIV, which is an MMO that I play a lot of,
4008000	4013000	they're having their Fan Fest, which I went to in Vegas last year.
4013000	4015000	I went in October.
4015000	4018000	But they're actually having their Fan Fest in Europe right now.
4018000	4021000	And this is kind of the end of the three Fan Fests
4021000	4025000	that are leading up to the launch of Stormblood in June, the next expansion.
4025000	4030000	And so they actually announced that the next playable class is going to be Samurai,
4030000	4032000	was something that they announced at Fan Fest.
4032000	4036000	But they were doing some Q&A and all this stuff at the European Fan Fest.
4036000	4041000	And one of the questions that the producer got asked of Final Fantasy XIV was,
4041000	4046000	would you consider bringing Final Fantasy XIV to the Nintendo Switch?
4046000	4048000	And the answer that Yoshida gave was,
4048000	4054000	in order for it to come to the system, cross-platform play would need to be supported.
4054000	4059000	Yoshida naturally wants the polished title on as many systems as possible.
4059000	4064000	And this has always been his reasoning for why it's not on Xbox One,
4064000	4067000	is that he'll be happy to put the game on Xbox One,
4067000	4070000	but Microsoft has to allow cross-platform.
4070000	4071000	You will be able to play the game.
4071000	4072000	Which I thought they were.
4072000	4074000	Well, I thought they were now, too.
4074000	4076000	I'm a little surprised that none of these Fan Fests...
4076000	4079000	I think it has to be in PlayStation. PlayStation has to also allow...
4079000	4080000	Well, they do, but...
4080000	4081000	I think they do.
4081000	4083000	I don't know. I don't know how that works.
4083000	4085000	I thought it wasn't...
4085000	4087000	Rocket League was supposed to be moving that direction, weren't they?
4087000	4090000	Where you could play cross-platform on all that stuff.
4090000	4095000	So, I mean, yeah, I think Microsoft and Sony are both realizing these policies do them more harm than good.
4095000	4099000	So, especially when Microsoft was just fine with Final Fantasy XI,
4099000	4102000	back when they needed strength on the Xbox 360.
4102000	4106000	So, I'm really surprised that Final Fantasy XIV has not been announced,
4106000	4108000	or at least Stormblood, for the Xbox One.
4108000	4112000	But all that stuff aside, let's talk about the Nintendo Switch for a minute.
4112000	4116000	You know, the whole fact that you could take it out portable,
4116000	4119000	as long as you had a Wi-Fi connection, because it is an online game after all,
4119000	4122000	is kind of neat, but at the same time...
4122000	4125000	And Final Fantasy XIV does play very well on a controller.
4125000	4127000	Like, you can do it very easily on PlayStation 4.
4127000	4129000	But at the same time, here's what I worry about.
4129000	4136000	A lot of folks were very happy to hear that Final Fantasy XIV is going to be ending PlayStation 3 support.
4136000	4142000	And the reason for that is, is that now they can push Final Fantasy XIV even further,
4142000	4148000	graphically and all this other stuff that they wouldn't be able to do on the PlayStation 3 because of the limitations.
4148000	4155000	As far as I know, a Switch is more powerful than PlayStation 3, but it's not as powerful as PlayStation 4.
4155000	4160000	So if the Switch is now going to be the lowest common denominator that holds the game back,
4160000	4162000	I don't want to see it released on the Switch.
4162000	4165000	I don't want to see the game move further.
4165000	4172000	Now, if I'm wrong, and they are perfectly capable of releasing the game on Switch,
4172000	4174000	without having to make any concessions to what...
4174000	4178000	You know, if the Switch is just powerful enough to do what they need the game to do,
4178000	4180000	then fine, cool, put it on the Switch.
4180000	4182000	But I just don't want the Switch to become the new PlayStation 3.
4182000	4183000	Does that make sense?
4183000	4184000	Yeah, that makes sense.
4184000	4188000	So, I don't think the whole portableness and all that stuff is worth it.
4188000	4194000	I don't think you have to talk about Nintendo has to be willing to be cross-play with Sony and Microsoft.
4194000	4197000	Like, I kind of just don't see that happening at all.
4197000	4200000	No, they don't know how to do that. That's not going to happen.
4200000	4202000	Well, it would be through Square Enix's servers. That's how they do it.
4202000	4203000	It's not, it's...
4203000	4208000	Because, you know, again, we can sit here and say, Nintendo doesn't know how to do it,
4208000	4212000	but remember, Phantasy Star Online was awesome on the GameCube.
4212000	4216000	No, but too bad it was the one fucking GameCube game that ever used that adapter
4216000	4219000	to let you get on the internet with it.
4219000	4224000	So, I mean, I have no reason to believe that Nintendo is not capable of doing these things.
4224000	4226000	Will it do these things?
4226000	4229000	And also, I don't know if it would really...
4229000	4232000	I mean, it would be fun to be able to play it, like, I guess, portably,
4232000	4236000	but you're right, you need to have, like, a good Wi-Fi connection to do that.
4236000	4241000	So, how feasible would it really be to, I mean, just get a laptop at that point?
4241000	4243000	I mean, seriously.
4243000	4247000	Well, I'm all for more people getting exposed to this game through new consoles,
4247000	4252000	but, you know, again, just as long as it's not going to hold it back for everybody else,
4252000	4254000	we'll see what happens with the Switch.
4254000	4257000	They did, though, I'll briefly mention this before we go on to Loki's next story.
4257000	4261000	They did tease a little bit about the PlayStation 4 Pro,
4261000	4264000	and it sounds like they are going to be doing a Pro patch for PlayStation.
4264000	4268000	Even without the Pro patch, though, that little beta thing that they've got,
4268000	4272000	like, whatever they call that, the overclocking or whatever it does,
4272000	4275000	it apparently makes it run much nicer.
4275000	4278000	Yeah, yeah. I'm excited to see what they do for a play.
4278000	4281000	I guess one of those things where it's not a super high priority for them,
4281000	4284000	but they are realizing that they can make PlayStation 4 Pro
4284000	4287000	be able to display more things, you know, with the added RAM and all that stuff.
4287000	4289000	So, they're talking about that.
4289000	4292000	So, I'm curious, because I do own the game on PlayStation 4,
4292000	4294000	although I probably won't get Stormblood on PlayStation 4,
4294000	4296000	because, okay, double dipping is a little much,
4296000	4299000	but that's one of those things where inevitably on Black Friday,
4299000	4302000	it will go on sale very cheap, and then I'll buy it and catch up that way,
4302000	4305000	and be able to play on the TV and PC.
4305000	4306000	Cool.
4306000	4307000	Because I'm a nerd.
4307000	4308000	All right, let's move on. Loki.
4308000	4311000	One of the other games I was actually thinking about today,
4311000	4314000	I should really go back and play, Watch Dogs 2 is getting some DLC.
4314000	4317000	So, this new piece of DLC is called Human Conditions,
4317000	4320000	and it revolves around self-driving cars.
4320000	4323000	So, basically, the premise is the company,
4323000	4326000	the Google equivalent in this game, Noodle,
4326000	4331000	has these self-driving cars that assign values to people's lives.
4331000	4333000	So, in the case of an accident,
4333000	4338000	the car will prioritize the safety of whomever it deems to be worth more.
4338000	4344000	And so, of course, there's a lot of morality questions regarding that.
4344000	4349000	So, of course, they're going to be hacking Noodle to stop this.
4349000	4350000	The other thing, of course,
4350000	4354000	there's some other missions that involve ransomware machines
4354000	4356000	and barrier hospitals.
4356000	4363000	So, that should be coming out, actually, next week on PlayStation 4.
4363000	4369000	Yeah, it's on the 21st, and PlayStation 4 and PC and Xbox One are March 23rd.
4369000	4377000	And then, also, the ending has been edited as well.
4377000	4381000	So, there's a new update that extends the ending to the game,
4381000	4386000	which says that there may be a hint at the location for Watch Dogs 3,
4386000	4388000	or a possible expansion to the game.
4388000	4392000	So, apparently, at the end of the game, spoiler, I guess,
4392000	4395000	there is a WAV file, which the title,
4395000	4399000	which parents to be coordinates pointing to London.
4399000	4406000	So, perhaps London will be the next location of Watch Dogs 3.
4407000	4408000	So, we'll have to see.
4408000	4409000	But, yeah, I should go back and play that game,
4409000	4411000	because it's actually pretty cool.
4411000	4412000	All right.
4412000	4418000	Yeah, I think, especially because Watch Dogs 2 has been getting more,
4418000	4420000	you know, it's been getting better reviews even than the first one.
4420000	4422000	I don't see why they won't do a third game.
4422000	4425000	I guess it's sales at the end of the day.
4425000	4427000	Yeah, I do need to go back and play it there,
4427000	4429000	because that was a pretty good game.
4429000	4431000	All right.
4431000	4433000	Let's move on and talk a little bit about,
4433000	4436000	oh, this is another, god, I hate to keep going back to the Switch.
4436000	4440000	I actually don't think this is as bad as everyone's making it out to be.
4440000	4442000	I'm curious to see where Loki's going to be on the fence with this.
4442000	4445000	But it was announced this week that one of the big games
4445000	4447000	that's going to be on the Switch, well, on the Wii U as well, really,
4447000	4449000	is, of course, Zelda Breath of the Wild.
4449000	4455000	And they are going to be doing a $20 season pass for the game
4455000	4457000	that will go on sale on March 3rd.
4457000	4460000	There's a whole YouTube that Eiji Aonuma did
4460000	4464000	to talk about how Hyrule will be better because of this expansion pack
4464000	4466000	that they're going to be doing.
4466000	4468000	There's going to be two release dates for this.
4468000	4470000	There's going to be a summer expansion,
4470000	4472000	and there's going to be a winter expansion.
4472000	4475000	But with this expansion pack, you'll be able to get new chests
4475000	4478000	and clothing in Breath of the Wild right from the start.
4478000	4481000	Once the DLC hits in the summer, you're going to get the Cave of Trials
4481000	4484000	in a harder difficulty setting and an additional map feature.
4484000	4488000	And then in the winter, there's going to be a new, I guess, side story,
4488000	4492000	and another new dungeon and additional challenges in the game.
4492000	4495000	But there's a lot of people that are kind of going,
4495000	4498000	ah, fuck, Zelda's going DLC.
4498000	4501000	Here goes Nintendo down this season pass route.
4501000	4503000	I definitely have an opinion on this.
4503000	4505000	I'm curious where you're at, though, Loki.
4505000	4506000	I've got to ask.
4506000	4509000	It just has to be worthwhile, I mean, what the content is.
4509000	4511000	I don't know what it is.
4511000	4513000	So, I mean, they mention a little bonus chest.
4513000	4515000	I think that's stupid.
4515000	4517000	I mean, that's kind of unnecessary.
4517000	4520000	You want to see how meaty this cave, what is this, the Cave of Trials
4520000	4521000	and all this stuff is.
4521000	4525000	Yeah, I think it sounds really short, just based on the whole side story
4525000	4528000	and stuff, but this doesn't seem like worthwhile content.
4528000	4531000	Whereas Mario Kart, that was pretty cool because they actually had
4531000	4533000	some good tracks and new characters and stuff,
4533000	4536000	and that was definitely more substantial as far as this.
4536000	4538000	And I didn't have a problem with the season pass on that.
4538000	4542000	Zelda almost feels like they're just throwing it in there because they can.
4542000	4545000	Well, I think, though, Loki, because, and you pointed out,
4545000	4548000	because a Mario Kart 8 is kind of like a proven track record for them,
4548000	4550000	I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt.
4550000	4553000	And I think Nintendo, you know, as strange as it is,
4553000	4555000	they seem to do DLC.
4555000	4557000	They're one of the best at DLC right now.
4557000	4559000	Like, their DLC that they do is really good.
4559000	4562000	You know, they had it us all in the Mario Brothers 2, Golden Coins.
4562000	4565000	A lot of these other games that Nintendo's done their own DLC for
4565000	4567000	have actually been pretty kick-ass.
4567000	4568000	So I'm okay with this.
4568000	4571000	I'm completely okay with this, and I'll probably even buy it
4572000	4577000	because I'm sure these things are going to be like the Mario Kart 8 DLC.
4577000	4580000	If I'm wrong, then I won't make that mistake again in the future,
4580000	4584000	but right now I feel a little better about this
4584000	4587000	than I even do kind of where Final Fantasy XV's been going,
4587000	4591000	and I'm starting to have a little bit of buyer's remorse on that season pack for XV.
4591000	4593000	Yeah, XV. Yeah, that's a little weird.
4593000	4595000	I didn't care for that carnival thing they put in.
4595000	4598000	I thought it was just a little, I thought I was kind of silly myself.
4599000	4603000	I'm hopeful the Gladio story will be good,
4603000	4606000	and I know where that's going to fit in into the main story.
4606000	4610000	It's very obvious where all, there is very, very, very obvious
4610000	4612000	if you play through Final Fantasy XV
4612000	4615000	where each and every one of those side stories fit into the main game.
4615000	4618000	So I'm curious to do the Gladio thing and play that through.
4618000	4623000	I just, I hope it's better than the stuff we're seeing so far,
4623000	4627000	which is free, so it's okay if the carnival is not that great
4627000	4629000	because it was free, so fine.
4629000	4630000	Free is free.
4630000	4633000	But I'll be curious about this other stuff.
4633000	4636000	So, let's see, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says,
4636000	4640000	I literally just got to that part of the main story last night about Gladio.
4640000	4642000	Yeah, so let's, hey, take your time.
4642000	4647000	If you keep going that slowly, then you won't ever have to play the chapter 13
4647000	4650000	that I played, and that's probably not a bad thing.
4650000	4652000	And I've actually been holding off on playing the game
4652000	4654000	because of all this DLC stuff.
4654000	4656000	I kind of want to play the full game when it comes out
4656000	4658000	and not have to go back and play all this shit,
4658000	4662000	so I'm waiting to do all that.
4662000	4667000	Akdeft points out, Mario Kart 8, Smash, and Hyrule Warriors have great DLC.
4667000	4670000	Let's see, Orangewrite says Mario Kart season pass was good.
4670000	4673000	Only season pass I ever bought, though.
4673000	4675000	Smash is a little expensive.
4675000	4679000	Smash did get expensive, but I also understand the need for licensing,
4679000	4682000	especially with things like Cloud and Bayonetta and Ryu and all this stuff,
4682000	4684000	so it's like, okay.
4684000	4686000	Then don't put those characters in there.
4686000	4688000	Are you kidding? Absolutely put those characters in there.
4688000	4690000	They're a lot of fun.
4690000	4692000	So they cost a little premium. Big deal.
4692000	4694000	No, bullshit. You shouldn't have to pay for licensing fees
4694000	4696000	if you have your own fucking library full of characters
4696000	4698000	that you could be putting in there.
4698000	4700000	I agree and I don't agree.
4700000	4702000	I think in order to get some of those extra characters,
4702000	4704000	if they have to cost a dollar or two more, fine.
4704000	4705000	I'm fine with it.
4705000	4708000	Getting to be able to play with Cloud and Smash is awesome.
4709000	4711000	They couldn't put Snake back in there?
4711000	4713000	Well, a licensing thing.
4713000	4715000	Do you think anybody at Konami was functioning
4715000	4717000	when this game was being made?
4717000	4719000	It was a different story back when the last game was being made.
4719000	4721000	It's different now.
4721000	4723000	Anyhow, all right.
4723000	4725000	Let's move on to some more stories.
4725000	4727000	Loki, something that's not the Switch.
4727000	4729000	Some good news from Nintendo that's not the Switch,
4729000	4731000	or Nintendo adjacent.
4731000	4734000	The expansion finally came out,
4735000	4738000	so now you can get those Johto Pokémon.
4738000	4740000	So they added 80 new Pokémon to the game,
4740000	4743000	including some new berries you can get as well,
4743000	4747000	and then some new items on top of that.
4747000	4749000	Evolution items.
4749000	4751000	And then the berries.
4751000	4753000	There's a pineapple berry that looks like a pineapple,
4753000	4756000	and it will not quite double the candy,
4756000	4758000	but it gives you more candy.
4758000	4761000	I caught a Cyndaquil spawn in the house today.
4761000	4763000	I must live in a Cyndaquil nest now.
4764000	4766000	And I caught it, and I used that berry,
4766000	4768000	because, oh, if this is a starter Pokémon,
4768000	4770000	I want to use those berries to get more candy,
4770000	4772000	because starter Pokémon are not as common, usually.
4772000	4774000	Do they have new starter Pokémon now?
4774000	4776000	Well, no.
4776000	4778000	If you start a new character,
4778000	4781000	you still only get to pick from Bulbasaur, Squirtle,
4781000	4783000	or you walk away from him and you get Pikachu.
4783000	4785000	It's still that same way. They didn't change that.
4785000	4788000	But they were the starters in Gen 2,
4788000	4790000	so obviously Cyndaquil and Totodile,
4790000	4793000	and those guys are still, you know...
4793000	4796000	Are you pulling up Pokémon Go to see if there's a Cyndaquil out right now?
4796000	4799000	No, I see him. I see him once in a while.
4799000	4801000	And then there's another berry.
4801000	4804000	The other berry is like Valium for the Pokémon.
4804000	4806000	It slows them down.
4806000	4808000	Yeah, because they have the new encounters now,
4808000	4810000	so they move around quite a bit.
4810000	4812000	Have you seen Abra?
4812000	4815000	Yeah, that's the one that flies into Figure 8 on the screen.
4815000	4819000	I didn't find that stuff to be that bad, though.
4819000	4822000	It's just another thing they do to fuck with you,
4822000	4825000	besides the whole attacking in one place.
4825000	4827000	So I thought that was, you know, whatever.
4827000	4830000	Can I just say, I am very tired of seeing these stupid Murkrows,
4830000	4832000	because they don't evolve at all.
4832000	4833000	They're everywhere.
4833000	4834000	Yeah, they're fucking everywhere.
4834000	4835000	They are.
4835000	4836000	What are you catching right now?
4836000	4838000	A Murkrow.
4839000	4841000	But I'm fucking tired of seeing them,
4841000	4845000	because I'm going to have one buffed up Murkrow at the end,
4845000	4848000	because they're all over the place, but you can't evolve them.
4848000	4851000	A Niantic, Nerf Blissey.
4851000	4853000	Oh my god, Blissey is unreal right now.
4853000	4856000	You can't fight Blissey in a gym unless you have two people.
4856000	4857000	What's Blissey?
4857000	4860000	It's an evolved Chauncey that was in Gen 2.
4860000	4864000	And I don't know, if you guys are like me,
4864000	4867000	you got a shit ton of Chauncey candies during the Valentine's event,
4867000	4871000	so you were able to evolve Blissey when Gen 2 went live, which I did.
4871000	4874000	And it's cool that I have one, but everybody else has one too.
4874000	4877000	And if they're on a gym, they have so many hit points,
4877000	4881000	you can't take them out in the 99 second clock on the gym.
4881000	4884000	So you have to have two people to do it to get the Blissey's hit points down in time.
4884000	4886000	It sucks, because I don't think there's a...
4886000	4889000	Blissey is a normal type, so what would be effective against it?
4889000	4890000	Fighting type?
4890000	4892000	I tried using a Machomp, or...
4892000	4894000	Is Machamp? No.
4894000	4895000	God, I can't remember.
4895000	4897000	Machoke is the fully evolved one, right?
4897000	4901000	That's the one I tried to use against the best fighting type one I had,
4901000	4903000	and it wasn't doing anything.
4903000	4906000	Maybe somebody in chat knows which one.
4906000	4909000	You gotta use against Blissey, because that is...
4909000	4911000	They're gonna have to balance that.
4911000	4913000	Some other things that they added too.
4913000	4916000	They added new Avatar items, which cost money.
4916000	4918000	So fuck them for that.
4918000	4920000	They also added some new music.
4920000	4923000	Well, Loki, if you caught enough gyms, you can get the gold.
4923000	4925000	Get it that way.
4925000	4927000	I'm not buying their shit. Fuck that.
4927000	4931000	They even have a t-shirt, I think, that says 30 if you reach level 30.
4931000	4933000	I'm assuming that's when that unlocks.
4933000	4934000	Yeah.
4934000	4936000	But I don't care.
4936000	4937000	Yeah, new music.
4937000	4942000	So they have new music at night, and new music encounters at night as well.
4942000	4944000	I suppose there's more of a variety of Pokémon,
4944000	4947000	because honestly, I'm still running into the same few.
4947000	4950000	Oh god, are you gonna be one of those people that's already waiting for Gen 3?
4950000	4952000	No, I'm not waiting for Gen 3.
4952000	4956000	I'm waiting for those other Pokémon to come around.
4956000	4958000	I did run into some different things,
4958000	4962000	like I got Psyduck finally, and a Chansey, and all that.
4962000	4964000	The nests are rebalancing too.
4964000	4968000	I love the Silph Road props to the people that run that site,
4968000	4970000	but there's an atlas thing on Silph Road,
4970000	4972000	and it's all crowd sourced, basically.
4972000	4974000	So you kind of note where the nests are in your neighborhood,
4974000	4978000	and it's a great way to figure out where the Pokémon you want are.
4978000	4983000	And so, yeah, now you can see how the Gen 2 are kind of in there as well.
4983000	4986000	So it does make some of the Gen 1 harder to find,
4986000	4989000	which is a bummer, because there's still things I need like Kabuto.
4989000	4991000	I don't have a Kabutops.
4991000	4993000	So I still need enough Kabuto to evolve that,
4993000	4996000	and now the Kabuto are harder to find their nests,
4996000	4999000	because there's Gen 2 nests that are available.
4999000	5003000	But the good news is there are still at least some Kabuto nests out there.
5003000	5005000	It's just I may have to drive a little further to find them,
5005000	5008000	because they're not going to be as frequent.
5010000	5012000	To register participation for this week's episode of
5012000	5017000	Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, cup.
5017000	5018000	There you go.
5018000	5021000	But I think the game kind of needed a kick in the ass.
5021000	5023000	A lot of people have been going around going,
5023000	5025000	Dead game, LOL.
5025000	5026000	I've definitely seen a lot of activity.
5026000	5028000	I work in downtown Sacramento now,
5028000	5031000	and it's just fucking lit up.
5031000	5034000	There's ridiculous amounts of lures on shit.
5034000	5037000	I'm like, holy fuck, it's pouring rain outside.
5037000	5040000	There's lures on every single lure down in Capitol Park and stuff.
5040000	5043000	When they were lasting for six hours, that kind of helps too.
5043000	5044000	Well, no, it wasn't lasting for six.
5044000	5046000	This is after that whole Valentine's Day thing is up.
5046000	5047000	Oh, really?
5047000	5048000	Unless they're still lasting for six hours.
5048000	5051000	I thought the six hour thing was going to go on for two more days.
5051000	5055000	Last time I saw, because I still have some in inventory,
5055000	5057000	it still says they last for 30 minutes,
5057000	5060000	unless they didn't update that verbiage.
5060000	5062000	They probably didn't update the verbiage ever.
5062000	5065000	And Act F points out the six hour thing ended today.
5065000	5067000	Okay, well then that's probably why there were so many.
5067000	5068000	Yeah, that's probably why there were so many.
5068000	5070000	But it'll be interesting to see what it looks like when you go back.
5070000	5072000	I still do, even during 30 minutes,
5072000	5075000	the time I see lures used is when people go to dinner,
5075000	5078000	and there's a pokestop at dinner, and people will lure.
5078000	5081000	Yeah, that's still getting used for that.
5081000	5083000	And I'm sure will be, even with Gen 2.
5083000	5087000	All right, well, we're going to take a step.
5087000	5089000	Oh, and I hit 24 this week as well.
5089000	5091000	Congrats. I hit 28. Get on my level.
5091000	5092000	I'm just kidding.
5092000	5094000	But I did hit 28. I'm excited.
5094000	5098000	All right, let's travel to a time when games were simpler.
5098000	5100000	Oops, that is not, that's a different theme song.
5100000	5102000	How about this theme song?
5102000	5104000	Yes, there you go.
5104000	5106000	We're going to travel back to a simpler time,
5106000	5110000	when you didn't have cell phones to play games.
5110000	5113000	In fact, you didn't need much to play this game.
5113000	5117000	It's time to get into the classic game of the week.
5117000	5121000	And this is where usually Dark Sakura would step into the gaming vault
5121000	5123000	and find a game that she thinks,
5123000	5126000	hey, you brats should be playing this game this week.
5126000	5129000	But Dark Sakura's not here tonight, so you know what that means.
5129000	5132000	Halo. Just kidding. I don't want to die.
5132000	5134000	We're going to pick a different game here for the classic game of the week.
5134000	5137000	But I am going to pick this week's classic game of the week as my choice.
5137000	5141000	And I have picked, I've gone way back for this one.
5141000	5143000	Way back, Loki. This is way back.
5143000	5145000	Let's picture a simpler time.
5145000	5150000	How about the first release of this game in 1977?
5150000	5155000	Or maybe the releases that I remember were a little more recent, 1980.
5155000	5160000	In fact, these games are so old, they don't have music in them.
5160000	5163000	So I don't really have anything to play in the background.
5163000	5171000	But this series ended up being so popular that it showed up in gaming again and again and again.
5171000	5177000	And it even showed up in gaming, gosh, probably in the 90s during the CD-ROM era.
5177000	5183000	And they did this epic introduction in one of the games that reimagined the very first game
5183000	5187000	in this epic cinematic opening that says,
5187000	5193000	You're standing behind the White House. In one corner is a small window, which is slightly ajar.
5193000	5196000	That's right. Classic game of the week this week is Zork.
5196000	5198000	That's what I've picked this week.
5198000	5200000	I have some folks in the chatroom called it. Good job.
5200000	5205000	Zork is the classic game of the week this week, which is a text adventure-based game,
5205000	5208000	or at least it was when it was first released.
5208000	5211000	And I do want to state, even though I played a little clip there from Return to Zork,
5211000	5215000	the classic game of the week is going to be the original Zork trilogy,
5215000	5217000	or I guess Zork 1, if you will.
5217000	5219000	That's the one I remember the most.
5219000	5222000	But Zork, of course, was a text adventure-based game,
5222000	5225000	so you had to read in order to be able to play this game.
5225000	5227000	It wasn't something that had fancy graphics,
5227000	5231000	because the original version of Zork was written in the late 70s.
5231000	5233000	They used a programming language called MDL,
5233000	5238000	and they used a computer that you don't even have in your home, the DEC PDP-10.
5238000	5243000	It was written by four different authors, Tim Anderson, Mark Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling,
5243000	5245000	and they were all out of MIT.
5245000	5248000	They were part of the dynamic modeling group at MIT.
5248000	5252000	So this game that they imagined ended up being published commercially by Infocom,
5252000	5254000	and they did split it into three games.
5254000	5257000	They had Zork, The Great Underground Empire, which was part one,
5257000	5261000	Zork 2, The Wizard of Frobaz, and Zork 3, which was the Dungeon Master.
5261000	5265000	And this was not the first text adventure game,
5265000	5268000	but it took the text adventure games a little bit further
5268000	5271000	because you could use more of the English language with it.
5271000	5274000	Like, in early games, you might have been able to say, like,
5274000	5282000	hit monster, but Zork would allow you to say hit monster with the dagger.
5282000	5286000	Like, it would actually let you put together sentences in the game.
5286000	5290000	So it was a little more powerful of a text adventure game.
5290000	5294000	So anyway, Zork was set in the ruins of an ancient empire lying far underground.
5294000	5296000	That was the opening line in Zork there.
5296000	5300000	It was about the White House, the mailbox, and all that.
5300000	5303000	So you actually go into the house, you go into the underground,
5303000	5306000	and you hope that you don't get eaten by a grue,
5306000	5308000	which was a very scary thing in the games,
5308000	5310000	is that you might move into the rooms.
5310000	5315000	If you're not properly lit, you will actually get eaten by a grue.
5315000	5317000	And then you travel through the Great Underground Empire,
5317000	5320000	and you look for treasures to complete the adventure.
5320000	5323000	And this is a very hard game.
5323000	5325000	I remember being a kid. I was not able to get very far in this.
5325000	5329000	We did own Zork on the Commodore 64, and I do remember playing this game,
5329000	5331000	and I always got eaten by the fucking grue.
5331000	5336000	I never was able to really get past that until there were maps,
5336000	5338000	there were strategy guides.
5338000	5342000	I'm sure there was even the published way on how to get from start to finish
5342000	5344000	as fast as possible.
5344000	5346000	But it was a tough game.
5346000	5350000	Especially for people that were really into fantasy novels.
5350000	5352000	The 70s was really a great...
5352000	5354000	I mean, fantasy novels are still big today.
5354000	5358000	But even in the 70s, when Dungeons & Dragons was still growing in popularity,
5358000	5361000	and so forth, we didn't really have video games realizing a lot of that yet.
5361000	5366000	Zork presented a really cool little thing for fantasy novel fans
5366000	5370000	to be able to do a choose-your-own-adventure type of novel,
5370000	5373000	but on the next level, really.
5373000	5379000	So anyhow, Zork, by the way, apparently there are 28 ways for you to die in Zork.
5379000	5381000	One of them is getting eaten by a grue, I know that.
5381000	5386000	And you can actually beat the game in 228 moves by exploiting a bug.
5386000	5388000	That's what they're saying.
5388000	5391000	So I guess you could speedrun Zork if you really wanted to.
5391000	5393000	I wonder if he'll do that in a future Awesome Games Done Quick.
5393000	5396000	You'll have to be able to read fast in order to do that. I don't know.
5396000	5399000	But anyway, it's a text adventure game,
5399000	5403000	so I don't know how many of you guys really got to check this out or play it,
5403000	5406000	but they did do some interesting re-releases of the game.
5406000	5408000	I remember this was on GameTap.
5408000	5412000	Remember the GameTap thing, when you rented all the games for whatever?
5412000	5414000	Zork, the whole trilogy, was there on GameTap.
5414000	5417000	That was probably the most recent time I played that series.
5417000	5420000	But also, what was this?
5420000	5425000	In Call of Duty Black Ops in 2010, there's actually an Easter egg
5425000	5429000	where you can get up in the main menu from a chair and find a computer,
5429000	5433000	and if you type Zork into the computer, you play Zork 1,
5433000	5436000	and the full game is in Call of Duty Black Ops,
5436000	5439000	because Activision now owns all these licenses back from the Infocom days.
5439000	5443000	So that's pretty cool. That's one way that you can do it there.
5443000	5445000	Did you know there were parodies as well?
5445000	5447000	I did not know this, Loki, but there were parody games of Zork.
5447000	5448000	It was so popular.
5448000	5454000	In 1988, they released Pork, the great underground sewer system.
5454000	5456000	How about that?
5456000	5460000	It's like straight out of Mad Magazine. I love it.
5460000	5463000	Anyway, Zork was a game that had a huge legacy.
5463000	5466000	There were all sorts of sequels, including the Enchanter trilogy,
5466000	5469000	was the next thing released, which included Enchanter, Sorcerer, and Spellbreaker.
5470000	5474000	Wishbringer was kind of a side story that was also in the Zork universe.
5474000	5477000	There was then Beyond Zork and Zork Zero.
5477000	5480000	But then, after a five-year hiatus in 1993,
5480000	5484000	that's when Return to Zork came out, which was a CD-ROM game.
5484000	5486000	Did you ever play Return to Zork?
5486000	5488000	I never played any of the Zork games.
5488000	5492000	Return to Zork is awesome because it's one of the peak games
5492000	5495000	with the incredibly bad CD-ROM acting.
5496000	5499000	Oh, shoot. I closed the YouTube with the guy acting.
5499000	5500000	I didn't want the voice getting in here.
5500000	5504000	Hold on. Let me get to the part where he opens the mailbox in this video
5504000	5505000	and check out...
5505000	5509000	I know this is really great radio, but listen to this acting.
5509000	5512000	Ah, the sweepstakes winner.
5512000	5513000	I've been looking forward to...
5513000	5515000	No! No!
5515000	5516000	No!
5522000	5526000	Totally done how somebody would do their YouTube now,
5526000	5531000	with a piece of fabric from Jo-Ann's hung behind them
5531000	5534000	in their living room studio.
5535000	5536000	I love it. Anyway.
5536000	5538000	So Zork had some amazing...
5538000	5540000	Return to Zork had some amazing...
5540000	5543000	So what exactly was Zork? What is a Zork?
5544000	5547000	You would ask that. Zork was...
5548000	5551000	It's like a place, I'm assuming?
5551000	5555000	No, because the place was the great underground empire.
5555000	5558000	And SSU100Matt says it was a chapter in Ready Player One.
5558000	5562000	Yes, they did play a very big part in Ready Player One
5562000	5564000	because they had a whole bunch of these games in there
5564000	5567000	that you actually play out in real life type thing
5567000	5568000	and Zork was one of those.
5568000	5569000	Okay, so here it is.
5569000	5572000	The word Zork is a nonsense word.
5572000	5577000	Often used by MIT hackers as the name for any unfinished program
5577000	5579000	until they were ready to be installed on the system.
5579000	5583000	With the game complete, they renamed the game Dungeon.
5583000	5585000	By this time, the game was already quite popular
5585000	5588000	and becoming relatively well known in gaming circles.
5588000	5591000	Sometime in 1978, the developers received notice from TSR,
5591000	5593000	the publishers of Dungeons & Dragons,
5593000	5595000	who claimed the game violated their copyrights.
5595000	5599000	So to avoid any legal wrangling, they changed the name back to Zork.
5600000	5603000	So it is a complete nonsense word.
5603000	5606000	I believe in the later games, it does end up being representative
5606000	5608000	of the land that you're going to.
5608000	5612000	But anyway, Return to Zork came out
5612000	5616000	and then they had the Philosopher's Stone.
5616000	5617000	Jesus Christ, I can't speak.
5617000	5620000	Zork Nemesis came out in 1996
5620000	5623000	and then Zork the Undiscovered Underground in 1997
5623000	5626000	and then the last game in the Zork series
5626000	5629000	was Zork Grand Inquisitor which came out in 1997
5629000	5632000	and that was the last time that the Zork series was really visited.
5632000	5635000	I actually owned Grand Inquisitor because I like those games
5635000	5642000	and they reminded me of a very fond time in my computer gaming life
5642000	5645000	when I was a kid, so I have a soft spot for these games.
5645000	5647000	Anyway, there it is, your classic game of the week,
5647000	5650000	Text Adventure Zork.
5650000	5653000	And even I learned tonight, it's a completely nonsensical word.
5653000	5655000	But a great series of games.
5655000	5658000	Alright, we're going to take a break though for now.
5658000	5661000	When we come back, there's plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come,
5661000	5664000	including games that are coming out this week,
5664000	5665000	what's in stores this week.
5665000	5668000	We're going to talk a little bit about updates on PlayStation Now
5668000	5673000	on Xbox One and did the NES classic, the mini classic,
5673000	5674000	did it end production?
5674000	5675000	If you don't have one...
5675000	5677000	Did it start production?
5677000	5680000	We'll answer those questions and more
5680000	5684000	when we come back after this break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5685000	5694000	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio Live Tonight,
5694000	5697000	episode number 676 already in progress for this,
5697000	5699000	February the 19th of 2017.
5699000	5701000	We're going to get into rapid fire news here shortly,
5701000	5705000	but first, I don't usually do this on the air,
5705000	5709000	but this is something for one of our long-time listeners.
5709000	5712000	I've known this guy for years and years now it seems.
5712000	5713000	He's a good friend of the show.
5713000	5717000	It's our pal Ranma over back east from New York,
5717000	5720000	part of Anime Jam Session, which by the way,
5720000	5725000	a related shout out here, is celebrating 300 episodes live this Tuesday.
5725000	5731000	So big snaps to the gang over at Anime Jam Session for that achievement
5731000	5733000	and be sure to be here live on Tuesday when that goes on.
5733000	5738000	But anyway, one way to get my attention is to send presents to the show.
5738000	5740000	So Ranma has sent a present to the show,
5740000	5744000	but it very clearly says, do not open package until next Sunday's show.
5744000	5746000	Well, guess what? It's Sunday.
5746000	5750000	But see, I'm worried it's going to be something for Jamie in here.
5750000	5752000	It's probably Gwyneth Paltrow's head.
5752000	5754000	It's probably just Gwyneth Paltrow's head in the box.
5754000	5757000	Well, I'm now, okay, I swear I have not looked in the box.
5757000	5758000	Do you hear me?
5758000	5761000	I did, during the break, I went and tried to loosen up some of the tape,
5761000	5763000	but that's all I've done to it to try to make this a little easier to open
5763000	5764000	live on air.
5764000	5766000	I think, ooh, do I feel bubble wrap?
5766000	5767000	My favorite.
5767000	5770000	He just sent me a wad of bubble wrap to sit there and pop, pop, pop.
5770000	5774000	Do you think it's any, yeah, there is bubble wrap,
5774000	5777000	but do you think, just guesses on what it might be before I open this,
5777000	5778000	because do you think it could be,
5778000	5780000	I know we were talking about Dunkin Donuts coffee last week.
5780000	5783000	I have a feeling it could, well, but no, I think he sent this before that.
5783000	5786000	But I'm going to guess it's something Dunkin Donuts.
5786000	5787000	You have a guess, Loki?
5787000	5788000	What did Ranma send us?
5788000	5789000	I don't know.
5789000	5790000	All right, we'll find out. Here we go.
5790000	5791000	Let's see.
5791000	5793000	If it's a donut, it's probably not survive the trip.
5793000	5796000	Can you talk us through this so I can, while I open this?
5796000	5797000	Yes, I'll let you.
5797000	5799000	He put a lot of fucking tape in this thing.
5799000	5806000	Yes, so there's red, red bubble wrap there.
5806000	5808000	Come on.
5808000	5809000	Where's your knife?
5809000	5810000	Where did I put the scissors?
5810000	5812000	I don't see him.
5812000	5813000	I got him, I got him.
5813000	5815000	This is great radio, Loki.
5815000	5816000	Don't cut yourself.
5816000	5817000	I'm trying.
5817000	5819000	God damn it, Ranma.
5821000	5824000	He just wants to make sure that no one steals anything.
5824000	5825000	This bitch.
5826000	5827000	What did he send you?
5829000	5832000	This is something where I think JB had to be here.
5832000	5837000	It is a bag of mini Stroop waffles,
5837000	5839000	for those of you that were here for the Christmas episode.
5839000	5843000	Not the liqueur, like we were indulging on Christmas,
5843000	5848000	but an actual bag of, like, the candy or whatever it is.
5848000	5850000	The actual waffle. Do you like waffles, Loki?
5850000	5851000	Of course, who doesn't?
5851000	5855000	So you're going to like these, which are caramel flavored, apparently.
5855000	5858000	You made me wait until the show for that.
5858000	5864000	I can't believe you sent this big old box to send us that.
5864000	5865000	And all this bubble wrap.
5865000	5869000	I'm so excited to pop each and every one of those bubbles later on.
5869000	5870000	There it is.
5870000	5871000	That's it?
5871000	5872000	Yep.
5872000	5873000	Loki, don't be ungrateful.
5873000	5875000	This is amazing.
5875000	5877000	I just thought that box would be more...
5877000	5882000	I know, I'm laughing because this poor guy spent this money
5882000	5885000	to send us a big old box for some Stroop waffles.
5885000	5886000	I love it, though.
5886000	5888000	These are going to be some delicious fucking Stroop waffles.
5888000	5889000	Thank you, Rama.
5889000	5892000	Rama said it's made with the liqueur.
5892000	5894000	All right, I guess I better open this up here.
5894000	5897000	Loki, why don't we get to some rapid fire news while I open this up
5897000	5899000	and then we can indulge in some of these on air.
5899000	5901000	And as far as Jamie's concerned...
5901000	5903000	Shh, don't tell her.
5903000	5904000	Don't tell her.
5904000	5906000	Don't tell her. We didn't get anything.
5906000	5908000	He just sent us bubble wrap. It was so rude.
5908000	5910000	All right, Loki.
5910000	5915000	All right, so Valve has finally patched a bug in Team Fortress 2.
5915000	5918000	And this was a 10-year-old bug, actually.
5918000	5922000	So what it was, apparently there was an issue with hit boxes,
5922000	5930000	depending on if you started off as a scout, heavier sniper class,
5930000	5935000	and then switched to a soldier pyro or demoman, engineer, medic, spy, or whatever.
5935000	5939000	There's going to be a discrepancy between your character's avatar hit box
5939000	5942000	due to the difference in the class's programming.
5942000	5947000	And apparently, because of that, it allowed certain hits not to be detected
5947000	5949000	and some to be detected when they shouldn't have been.
5949000	5952000	So now it's been fixed.
5952000	5954000	So that's pretty awesome.
5954000	5956000	It took him 10 years to fix that.
5956000	5962000	And then Final Fantasy XV is getting cup noodle.
5962000	5967000	Final Fantasy headgear.
5967000	5970000	It looks so epic.
5970000	5972000	Wearing cup noodle in your head.
5972000	5974000	I thought we got into this a little bit last week.
5974000	5976000	Didn't they announce, though, how this is coming out in the States now?
5976000	5981000	Because I know in Japan, you can only get this through buying all the ultra-rare cup of noodles.
5981000	5984000	Didn't they announce how it was going to come out over here?
5984000	5986000	No.
5986000	5988000	I thought they did.
5988000	5991000	They said something about some DLC kit was going to have it in there.
5991000	5995000	Well, they're saying that it's going to be...
5995000	6004000	Originally, you had the Final Fantasy Boss Collection, which was 6,084 yen.
6004000	6011000	And then, of course, now it's going to be available to download for the Boss Collection buyers sometime this summer.
6011000	6016000	So when you buy the cup noodle Final Fantasy Boss Collection.
6016000	6021000	I think the next convention I go to, maybe for MagWest or something,
6021000	6023000	I'm going to wear a giant cup noodle hat.
6023000	6024000	Why not?
6024000	6026000	It'll be an easy thing.
6026000	6028000	It'll be an easy thing to do.
6028000	6030000	It's just ridiculous.
6030000	6034000	Like, you guys are taking this cup noodle thing way too far.
6034000	6036000	Well, I mean, seriously, come on.
6036000	6039000	You have this epic game, Final Fantasy, and then you put this in there.
6039000	6041000	It's kind of ridiculous.
6041000	6043000	It's more of a Hitman thing.
6043000	6045000	And on a related note, try one of these stroopwafels.
6045000	6046000	They're fucking amazing.
6046000	6048000	Rama, they are so fucking good.
6048000	6050000	I'm making Loki try one.
6050000	6051000	Loki never eats food.
6051000	6052000	It's like a cookie.
6052000	6054000	It's very good.
6054000	6056000	And Maya in chat says Sky has stroopwafel mouth.
6056000	6059000	Yeah, maybe I've already eaten like three of them.
6059000	6061000	It doesn't taste like much.
6061000	6068000	Loki, next time you send a gift to the show, Rama, just say not for Loki.
6068000	6070000	Loki not allowed.
6070000	6072000	They're great.
6072000	6074000	I was expecting waffle tasting.
6074000	6076000	It does taste a little like waffle.
6076000	6077000	You don't taste the waffle?
6077000	6079000	You want me to get some of that liquor?
6079000	6080000	That tastes like waffle.
6080000	6082000	No, I don't mean waffle liquor.
6082000	6084000	I'm going to save some of these.
6084000	6085000	They're fucking Dens.
6085000	6086000	Yeah, I know. They're really good.
6086000	6088000	They've got a lot of caramel in them.
6088000	6090000	I'm going to save some for Alan.
6090000	6092000	I'm sure he'll be excited to try that when he gets home.
6092000	6096000	And maybe one or two will last through the week before Jaime's here next.
6096000	6097000	We'll see.
6097000	6099000	But you know, you snooze, you lose.
6099000	6101000	Should have been at the show.
6101000	6102000	All right.
6102000	6104000	Cough or no cough, you could add stroopwafel.
6104000	6105000	It would have made it better.
6105000	6106000	All right.
6106000	6109000	In all seriousness, let's move on and talk about Injustice 2.
6109000	6114000	Some folks excited for that upcoming game in the fighting series
6114000	6117000	that made by the same people that make Mortal Kombat.
6117000	6121000	And some more characters have been announced this week in a trailer.
6121000	6124000	Cheetah is one of the new characters that's going to be in the game.
6124000	6128000	A villain from the Wonder Woman universe, if you were unaware.
6128000	6133000	Also, Poison Ivy and Catwoman confirmed in the game.
6133000	6137000	So this is all kind of like a girl power type of trailer, if you will,
6137000	6140000	showing off some of the new characters in Injustice 2.
6140000	6142000	So looks pretty cool.
6142000	6144000	I like the first Injustice game.
6144000	6145000	It was pretty good.
6145000	6146000	Self-inplayed it.
6146000	6147000	I have it in my library.
6147000	6148000	Need to get on that.
6148000	6149000	Need to get on that.
6149000	6150000	Have a play.
6150000	6151000	All right.
6151000	6152000	Let's see.
6152000	6154000	And this is something you really need to get on.
6154000	6156000	And unfortunately, if you are listening to the podcast,
6156000	6158000	you're probably too late for this unless you already got it.
6158000	6159000	Those of you that are listening...
6159000	6160000	Oh, yeah.
6160000	6161000	I should buy that.
6161000	6162000	Yeah.
6162000	6163000	Those of you that are listening live,
6163000	6164000	you literally have your last chance this evening
6164000	6165000	because it's going away tomorrow.
6165000	6168000	But it is the Humble Freedom Bundle.
6168000	6171000	And this is a hell of a Humble Bundle.
6171000	6174000	Now, it is a $30 minimum,
6174000	6177000	which usually with Humble Bundle you're only paying $1.
6177000	6182000	But this is definitely going to be worth the $30 baseline.
6182000	6184000	So the Humble Freedom Bundle,
6184000	6186000	which you have 15 hours left to get and counting,
6186000	6188000	has like...
6188000	6190000	There's like 30-plus games in this.
6190000	6192000	There's an insane amount of games in this.
6192000	6194000	And the money that you donate,
6194000	6197000	you can't even choose to give it to the game makers
6197000	6199000	or as a Humble tip.
6199000	6202000	100% of these bundles will...
6202000	6206000	Yeah, 100% of the proceeds will go to one of these three charities
6206000	6207000	or all of these three charities
6207000	6210000	or however you choose to divide up your donation
6210000	6211000	between these three charities,
6211000	6214000	which includes the ACLU, Doctors Without Borders,
6214000	6216000	and the International Rescue Committee.
6216000	6218000	So, I mean, and when I say like huge games,
6218000	6220000	you've got things like The Witness,
6220000	6223000	which I think is 30 bucks itself,
6223000	6226000	Stardew Valley, the Day of the Tentacle remake,
6226000	6229000	you know, some things that have been in bundles before
6229000	6232000	like VVVV, Super Meat Boy, World of Goo,
6232000	6235000	but then even some newer releases are in here too
6235000	6237000	like 2064 Read Only Memories,
6237000	6242000	which just had that big patch that they did a couple weeks ago.
6242000	6243000	Let's see.
6243000	6246000	I just bought this game on Steam like a few...
6246000	6249000	like probably a month ago, Robot Roller Derby Disco Dodgeball.
6249000	6251000	Anyway, lots and lots and lots of games.
6251000	6252000	Also, e-books.
6252000	6255000	So you can get things like the hands-on intro to game programming
6255000	6256000	is available as well.
6256000	6259000	So anyhow, that's it.
6259000	6260000	I mean, there's tons in there.
6260000	6262000	Also, yeah, and it's pointed out,
6262000	6264000	clever username in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com
6264000	6267000	says Subnautica, they sold out of keys.
6267000	6268000	Yeah, they...
6268000	6271000	Same with Super Meat Boy, but the DRM versions there.
6271000	6273000	Right, and to be fair,
6273000	6275000	they did warn you that some of these games
6275000	6276000	would have a limited number.
6276000	6278000	And to be honest, I already have Super Meat Boy,
6278000	6279000	so that's no big deal.
6279000	6281000	I have most of these games already.
6281000	6283000	Yeah, I know there's a lot of these games I have,
6283000	6284000	but it is a really good cause.
6284000	6285000	Yeah, it's a really good cause.
6285000	6287000	And even just some of the e-books and stuff
6287000	6288000	I think are kind of cool,
6288000	6291000	like the whole programming one is probably one I could use.
6291000	6293000	There's even some music in there too,
6293000	6294000	which I think is pretty rad.
6294000	6296000	So yeah, check that out.
6296000	6297000	The Humble Freedom Bundle.
6297000	6298000	There's only 15 hours left,
6298000	6300000	so if you're listening to this on the podcast,
6300000	6301000	if it's already after...
6301000	6303000	Let's see, what would 15 hours from now be?
6303000	6307000	That's going to be 11 a.m. Pacific, about.
6307000	6310000	So if it's after that, you might be out of luck.
6310000	6313000	So anyhow, that's it.
6313000	6315000	Let's travel around and check out what is in stores this week.
6315000	6316000	Loki.
6316000	6319000	Alright, and I just purchased my Humble Freedom Bundle,
6319000	6322000	so we're good there.
6322000	6324000	Okay, this week we do have some things.
6324000	6327000	So we've got Berserk and the Band of the Hawk
6327000	6331000	on PC, PlayStation 4, and the Vita.
6331000	6336000	Halo Wars 2 on Xbox One and Windows 10.
6336000	6339000	Ys Origin on PlayStation 4.
6339000	6345000	And then that's actually it.
6345000	6346000	Next week, though, we've got some...
6346000	6349000	Or the week after, we've got some good stuff too.
6349000	6352000	Well, because the Switch is happening the week after, right?
6352000	6356000	Yeah, but Horizon Zero Dawn also is coming out the following week.
6356000	6360000	Oh, I realize that was out.
6361000	6363000	Let's travel to Japan right now
6363000	6365000	and check out some of the releases over there.
6365000	6368000	On February 23rd, which is my mom's birthday.
6368000	6370000	Happy birthday, mom.
6370000	6375000	In Japan, Nier Automata comes out on February 23rd.
6375000	6377000	Super Robot Wars V.
6377000	6379000	Batman Return to Arkham.
6379000	6383000	Majotohai Kihei comes out.
6383000	6388000	And, let's see, Assassin's Creed, the Ezio collection is all out.
6388000	6391000	And that's all on the PlayStation 4 this week.
6391000	6395000	I'm sure that Nier game has a lot of people interested in that.
6395000	6399000	There's also a brand new white DualShock 4 controller coming out.
6399000	6401000	And, oh, I missed some of these.
6401000	6404000	There's also Ride 2 is out this week.
6404000	6407000	So this is a busy, busy, busy week over in Japan for those games.
6407000	6409000	On the Vita, it doesn't slow down.
6409000	6411000	Super Robot Wars V is also on the Vita.
6411000	6414000	Island is out this week on the PlayStation Vita.
6415000	6417000	Timepiece Ensemble comes out,
6417000	6423000	as well as Galgun Doublepiece Bilingual comes out on the PlayStation Vita.
6423000	6426000	And, lastly, just checking out the Nintendo 3DS.
6426000	6430000	I don't think they really have anything because they probably are gearing up over there
6430000	6433000	for the Nintendo Switch release over there as well.
6433000	6435000	So, there you go.
6435000	6437000	How about the UK, Loki?
6437000	6439000	I know Dark Soccer's not here, but maybe you can help her out.
6439000	6441000	Yeah, not a whole ton of stuff coming out.
6441000	6443000	Now, Shift Happens.
6443000	6446000	That's on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
6446000	6449000	And, also, Lego Worlds is getting its console debut.
6449000	6452000	That's that kind of Lego-cross-Minecraft game.
6452000	6456000	And that's on PlayStation, yeah, PlayStation 4, Xbox One.
6456000	6459000	I thought that was the one they said they weren't going to make anymore.
6459000	6461000	Maybe I'm, like, clearly I'm crazy.
6461000	6463000	You're thinking mostly the online one.
6463000	6465000	No, this is the one that was in Early Access for a while
6465000	6467000	and then finally is out of Early Access.
6467000	6470000	I still haven't played it. I've gotten to it when it was in beta.
6470000	6472000	So, this has been a long time since I actually tried it out.
6472000	6475000	But, yeah.
6475000	6478000	So, that was a thing.
6478000	6482000	I thought this was coming out over here as well at some point soon,
6482000	6486000	but maybe that was on, like, a TBA release date.
6486000	6488000	Let me try to see here.
6488000	6490000	Oh, yeah, that was earlier this month.
6490000	6492000	So, that was back on the 7th.
6492000	6494000	Oh, no, I'm sorry. That's in March.
6494000	6496000	So, we're getting a little bit later over here.
6496000	6498000	All right.
6498000	6500000	So, that's really it.
6500000	6502000	All right. Let's go to our mailbag.
6508000	6510000	Every week you guys send us e-mails.
6510000	6512000	Participate at orangeloungeradio.com.
6512000	6516000	And we read said e-mails on the show.
6516000	6518000	Of course, some weeks are better than others.
6518000	6520000	Some weeks we get a lot of e-mails.
6520000	6522000	Some weeks we don't get any e-mails.
6522000	6524000	And this is one of those weeks where we have one e-mail.
6524000	6526000	So, thank you to our one e-mailer this week.
6526000	6528000	Participate at orangeloungeradio.com.
6528000	6532000	Our e-mail this week from YYR, serial e-mailer, to the program.
6532000	6534000	Hello, LR.
6534000	6537000	I wanted to send you a lousy e-mail so you had something to not read.
6537000	6539000	Well, when you're it, buddy, guess what?
6539000	6541000	I read it anyway.
6541000	6544000	I'm really glad you mentioned the DDR finals on last week's show.
6544000	6547000	And I'd encourage anyone interested to head over to YouTube and watch them.
6547000	6551000	I can also explain why you didn't recognize much of the song list used for the finals.
6551000	6554000	Back in DDR Extreme, the absolute hardest thing in the game
6554000	6557000	was the challenge chart for Paranoia Survivor Max.
6557000	6563000	In DDR Ace, that chart is rated 16 on the difficulty scale out of a possible 19.
6563000	6567000	But the only charts allowed in the finals were rated 17 and up,
6567000	6572000	which means that literally 100% of DDR Extreme was deemed to be too easy.
6572000	6574000	Time to get good.
6574000	6578000	By the way, is it just me or have you guys quietly retired the FUs of the Week segment?
6578000	6581000	I haven't noticed it lately.
6581000	6583000	It wasn't intentionally quietly retired.
6583000	6586000	It was supposed to be, during our big show roll, shake-up thing,
6586000	6588000	moved to the end of the show.
6588000	6591000	And I think part of what happened with that is that when it was supposed to be...
6591000	6592000	We just keep forgetting to do it?
6592000	6593000	We just keep forgetting to do it.
6593000	6596000	And now it's kind of one of those things... I got to admit, I kind of don't miss it.
6596000	6598000	Yeah, I don't either.
6598000	6600000	So, I don't know. It's one of those things...
6600000	6604000	I'm not going to say it's gone, but it's on an as-needed basis.
6604000	6608000	Because there's certainly going to be things that we're going to need to F you once in a while.
6608000	6611000	Which I know might be sad because it's a thing we've done ever since episode one,
6611000	6616000	but at the same time, maybe we have enough cynical stuff in video games.
6616000	6619000	And maybe we don't necessarily need more.
6619000	6621000	But again, when it's warranted, it will be here.
6621000	6624000	I feel like a lot of times when we're actually doing FUs of the Week,
6624000	6626000	it's like a struggle to think of something right away.
6626000	6628000	There's been a lot of weeks recently where people are like,
6628000	6630000	eh, I don't really have anything this week. It's been a good week.
6630000	6632000	So, you know.
6632000	6635000	But again, Jamie's not here to speak either.
6635000	6638000	I think she would feel very differently on this where she probably...
6638000	6641000	But then again, she probably hasn't noticed it's been missing either.
6641000	6643000	But, you know, again, I'm not going to say it's gone.
6643000	6646000	It's just going to be as an as-needed basis at this point.
6646000	6649000	So when there's things to rant about, we'll rant about it.
6649000	6654000	And SSG100Matt does point out, bad drivers did get the most FUs, lifetime-wise.
6654000	6659000	You know, on the inevitable day when OLR ends, maybe that's how we'll end it.
6661000	6664000	We'll end it with a gigantic FU and then roll credits.
6664000	6666000	Does that sound good?
6666000	6668000	Sure, why not?
6668000	6669000	All right.
6669000	6671000	OLR continues on.
6671000	6674000	By the way, props to you for catching that.
6674000	6677000	I did notice that we hadn't done it in a while.
6677000	6680000	But I kind of didn't want to shine a spotlight on it because, again,
6680000	6682000	we might want to bring it back or whatever.
6682000	6685000	But props to you for noticing.
6685000	6687000	Can't sneak one by you.
6687000	6691000	Why don't you go do something productive like find Carmen Sandiego?
6691000	6694000	All right, anyway.
6694000	6695000	The email finishes.
6695000	6698000	I don't have much else to say, so I'll leave you with this.
6698000	6703000	If you value your free time at all, avoid Pocket Card Jockey on 3DS.
6703000	6708000	It's developed by Game Freak, a.k.a. the Pokemon developers,
6708000	6711000	and it's a cross between Derby Owners Club and Solitaire.
6711000	6714000	And I'm addicted.
6714000	6715000	Oh, I see.
6715000	6716000	This is one of those.
6716000	6718000	Avoid it because you'll get sucked into it as well.
6718000	6720000	It's like the Derby Owners Club, now that we think about this.
6720000	6722000	Do they have it emulated on PC yet?
6722000	6726000	I could see myself wasting a lot of time on that.
6726000	6728000	That's a very good question.
6728000	6730000	Why wouldn't we have that?
6730000	6731000	Can you imagine that?
6731000	6732000	They've emulated everything.
6732000	6734000	That's what we need on the Switch right there.
6734000	6735000	Have that shit.
6735000	6737000	YYR says it is not emulated.
6737000	6742000	Must be the crazy fact that it's on multiple monitors and all this stuff.
6742000	6744000	Yeah, that's all networks together.
6744000	6746000	YYR says you have to emulate the networking card system too.
6746000	6748000	That's why it's not out yet.
6748000	6750000	Anyway.
6750000	6751000	So there you go.
6751000	6752000	That's me.
6752000	6753000	It's signed.
6753000	6754000	Aaron, YYR.
6754000	6755000	Good email, Aaron.
6755000	6757000	You get the gold star email of the week.
6757000	6759000	Do you know why you got the gold star email of the week?
6759000	6761000	Nobody else emailed us.
6761000	6762000	There you go.
6762000	6764000	A gold star all for you, YYR.
6764000	6766000	Congratulations.
6766000	6767000	All right.
6767000	6768000	That's going to do it for the mailbag.
6768000	6773000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want a gold star by default in future weeks.
6773000	6775000	In the meantime, we have more gaming news to get to,
6775000	6778000	and then we are going to open up that Skype line a little later,
6778000	6780000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
6780000	6781000	Loki.
6781000	6783000	Well, this is definitely a service I don't give a shit about.
6783000	6786000	PlayStation Now, have not used it, have no interest in using it,
6786000	6790000	but it's still a thing because sure as shit,
6790000	6794000	they're not going to give us any fucking support for PlayStation 2 or PlayStation 1 games anymore.
6794000	6797000	That fucking PlayStation Pro can render that 4K display,
6797000	6802000	but fuck if it can render goddamn PlayStation 1 and PlayStation 2 games.
6802000	6804000	It's just too complex for that thing.
6804000	6806000	PSP can handle it though.
6807000	6813000	But they are dropping support now for the PlayStation 3 and the Vita and other devices.
6813000	6821000	So now PlayStation Now will only work on the PlayStation 4 and the PC.
6821000	6823000	So anything else?
6823000	6825000	Not going to happen.
6825000	6832000	That is kind of shady that the Vita and the Vita TV are getting the shaft on that one.
6832000	6836000	It wasn't that long ago that they were pushing that Vita TV.
6836000	6841000	But at the same time, would I miss PlayStation Now?
6841000	6843000	Probably not.
6843000	6848000	Does PlayStation Now have PlayStation 4 games in it or is it just PS3 games?
6848000	6850000	I believe it's only PS3 games.
6850000	6852000	Maybe they're adding PlayStation 4 games.
6852000	6853000	Okay, maybe.
6853000	6857000	Woo, don't care though because I still want PlayStation 2 games and PlayStation 1 games.
6857000	6860000	I just think, look, I get what they were trying to do.
6860000	6864000	Well, at first I didn't understand what they were trying to do, but now they have the whole Netflix model, right?
6864000	6866000	I think that they're really missing it.
6866000	6868000	They're missing the opportunity.
6868000	6873000	They have these really deep sales sometimes on PlayStation 2 games, I think.
6873000	6875000	But they're only on PS3.
6875000	6881000	I have to pay $15 to get a PlayStation 2 game to run on PlayStation 4.
6881000	6886000	It's not the stuff that I already have in my library, which they know I have in my library.
6886000	6892000	But I would really love it if they added that support because you could have, with all these deep sales that they do,
6892000	6897000	just this impulse factor building up that library kind of like your Steam library.
6897000	6906000	It is kind of, actually no, it's really irritating that things that I bought digitally on PlayStation 3 that are supported by PlayStation Now,
6906000	6908000	I can't just play through PlayStation Now.
6908000	6910000	I think that's one of those concessions.
6910000	6912000	Maybe Sony doesn't want to do it because of bandwidth or power or something,
6912000	6916000	but I think if Sony wants PlayStation Now to become a better thing,
6916000	6922000	they need to get more eyes on it by giving you incentive for things that you've already got in the past.
6922000	6926000	And they'll make a sale when they sell more games on PlayStation 3 or whatever stuff in the past.
6926000	6932000	I think the way they went about doing the whole thing was just not the best.
6932000	6939000	And I understand, though, to their credit, for whatever it's worth, they probably had to renegotiate a lot of agreements.
6939000	6945000	I don't think maybe you necessarily had the right to stream a game just because it existed on PlayStation 3.
6945000	6950000	They probably had to go renegotiate with those companies, and that's why PlayStation Now's stock is limited.
6950000	6957000	But at the same time, for those companies that see the value in letting their PS3 games go on sale again, just do it.
6957000	6959000	I don't like the service, and here's why.
6959000	6965000	Because when I'm playing games, a lot of times my wife is streaming video.
6966000	6977000	So I can't have, even my bandwidth is pretty good, but I can't have a really nice stream for GameStream to go along with a video stream they have through Netflix.
6977000	6981000	It can't fit that kind of bandwidth on my system.
6981000	6993000	And so that's a problem because I've tried streaming, you can do the second screen support or whatever with your PC on PlayStation 4 and play it that way.
6993000	7003000	And it doesn't work well at all in my house, even though my PlayStation 4 is literally six feet away, and my router is like six feet away.
7003000	7007000	It's just like, it's right in front of me. But it still doesn't work on that network.
7007000	7014000	Did VibRibbon ever come out on PlayStation 4? Didn't they promise that when VibRibbon was first unveiled?
7014000	7018000	I don't remember. I can check.
7018000	7020000	Brad from PodCulture suggests hardwiring it?
7020000	7030000	Yeah, I could do that since it is that far away, but I shouldn't have to do that. I shouldn't have to go through this hassle to be able to play a game.
7030000	7034000	I mean, it should just work as is.
7034000	7048000	Alright, well, last week we talked about this a little bit, but it sounds like it's been growing this past week, and that is more support for Beam, which is of course Microsoft's answer to Twitch, or they recently acquired Beam.
7048000	7059000	Which I have a channel over on Beam, and I did enjoy streaming over there. There's not quite the same big community that you have on Twitch, so it can be harder to get discovered over there.
7059000	7068000	But it's going to be interesting to see how this changes the game a little bit, because now you can actually stream to Beam within the Xbox One.
7069000	7079000	We talked about this a little bit last week. It was in the Alpha program this week, but now it's actually been opened up to more people through a Beam app on Xbox One.
7079000	7086000	I do believe you still have to be in the Insider program. I don't think you are open to everybody yet. You do just have to be in the Xbox Insider program.
7086000	7097000	But apparently, you know why I didn't realize this, Loki? With as little as I play Xbox One, I'm not in the Alpha circle, but I'm in the next circle on Xbox One.
7097000	7108000	I actually get a lot of this stuff. For the preview stuff, Microsoft rolls it out in circles. The Alphas get it first, then there's an inner circle, then there's a bigger circle, and then it's like everybody.
7108000	7120000	Well apparently, I'm in one of the inner circles, and I didn't even realize this. But it's probably because I actually did some of the surveys and things in the preview program app, so maybe it gained my favor? I don't know.
7121000	7127000	William Murderface is asking my Beam channel name. Same as Twitch. Rob Roberts is what it is over on Beam.
7127000	7140000	Anyway, for Beam, now there's a whole little app that you can use with it if you're in the Insider program. You hit the guide button and you go to the Beam menu icon to start broadcasting.
7140000	7147000	You can turn your microphone on and off. You can also do camera on and off, although I'm assuming that's only Kinect. It's still not going to support just any old camera.
7147000	7156000	You can also do chat, camera position, overlay, and all that good stuff. You can also, inside the app, watch and interact with channels on Beam in real time.
7156000	7167000	You can also get the sparks and the XP. They try to incentivize watching streams by giving you XP, and then you can use these sparks that you earn to interact with streams.
7167000	7178000	It's interesting. I like Beam's approach. It's going to be interesting to see how this grows through 2017. They are definitely trying to do something even more interactive than what Twitch is so far.
7178000	7190000	There you go. They are going to also announce more for Beam at GDC 2017. It looks like Microsoft is really realizing that Amazon is really not competed with in the Twitch space effectively.
7190000	7199000	I do know that there's Hitbox and YouTube, but YouTube kind of has its own set of problems, and YouTube gaming really hasn't picked up the way it ought to be.
7199000	7206000	But YouTube has its own problems with the copyright claims and all that stuff, so that turns a lot of people off to YouTube to begin with.
7206000	7218000	So yeah, I think Microsoft is kind of seeing an opportunity here. We'll see what they do with it, but you know their press conference ain't going to stream on Twitch this year.
7218000	7222000	It's going to stream on Beam. Mark my words. Anyway.
7222000	7225000	I'll just watch it on YouTube.
7225000	7228000	Let's move on. Low-key.
7228000	7231000	All right.
7231000	7239000	So it looks like one of the things that we may be hearing about the new, during their press conference, is about Scorpio.
7239000	7251000	And so actually they're going to be unveiling information about the Scorpio during the press conference on June 11th, which is different than what's been in the past.
7251000	7260000	It's now moving to Sunday, which I did like how Bethesda put a little thing out there, you know, hey, imitating this. Okay, cool.
7260000	7266000	But yeah, they're going to be doing their press conference at 2 p.m. Pacific time, so that'll be earlier that day.
7266000	7271000	Did you make your flights for E3 already? Too bad. Rebook.
7272000	7280000	That's good news. Saturday is a cheaper travel day, I believe, because Friday and Sunday are big days, but Saturday is a little less, you know, is right in the middle of the weekend.
7280000	7285000	So you might be able to get some better deals on Saturday. There's that. You have to get another night at the hotel, but oh well.
7285000	7288000	I mean, man, that show is going to be pretty busy. Yeah.
7288000	7293000	And by the way, thanks a lot, assholes, for doing that to us on Sunday when we're trying to do a show here at OLR.
7293000	7297000	Although actually Microsoft should be done. Bethesda is the one that's right in the middle of our show.
7297000	7311000	Yeah, which I guess we'll just have to do what we've done the past few years and do like our abbreviated show where we just watch the press conference with y'all and do an hour-long show because we don't have any other time to do it because we get cut off by E3.
7311000	7317000	We could do with all the other streamers doing the reaction things, but I don't know if anyone wants to see that.
7317000	7328000	Yeah, I'm of the camp that nobody wants to see that. Like I'm fine with taping something that like later you can do, like the YouTube reaction videos and that stuff, but I just, I think it's a little silly.
7328000	7337000	But anyway, so I don't know, I don't know what we're going to do that episode yet. It's still months off in advance and who knows what else is going to change with E3.
7337000	7341000	Shit, maybe some miracle happens and I end up going, but I doubt it.
7342000	7352000	But with E3 on that Sunday, the press conference, the interesting thing is going to be that we can talk about Microsoft now on our show. We just won't be able to talk about the other two.
7352000	7354000	They did it just for us.
7354000	7362000	What's Nintendo going to do this year? We don't know yet. Are they going to go back to a press conference since they did one for the Switch or are they going to do a direct? Who knows?
7362000	7367000	No one knows. Just like no one knows what's going to happen to launch in two weeks of the Switch.
7368000	7376000	All right. Well, no one knows what happened to the NES Classic Mini either. They are still pretty hard to get. I don't know. It seemed like some more came out recently.
7376000	7379000	I want to get one still, but you know, it may be hard to find.
7379000	7396000	But an interesting rumor hit the internet this week, thanks to NeoGaf, of course, from a user who worked for a big retailer in Scandinavia, who apparently posted that we just got word from Nintendo, or rather their Nordic distributor, that the NES Classic Mini has reached its end of life and will be phased out.
7396000	7401000	According to them, production has ended and we will be receiving a few more shipments before everything dries up.
7401000	7406000	By our estimates, we as a single retailer might not be able to fulfill all orders that have been in place so far.
7406000	7411000	Our last shipment should arrive in April or May, and after that, there won't be any more shipments.
7411000	7419000	Which made a lot of us kind of go, what the fuck? Why would you, like, this thing has been huge. Why would you fucking pull it off shelves?
7420000	7426000	Now, but that is a rumor, I should stress, because there has been a follow-up.
7426000	7440000	Nintendo UK followed it up saying, quote, production for the Nintendo Classic Mini NES continues and NOE, Nintendo of Europe, will continue to ship units to retail on a regular basis.
7440000	7445000	That was from a Nintendo UK representative, basically saying that first statement was full of shit.
7445000	7447000	Here's what I think might be happening.
7447000	7460000	We've had a lot of stories recently about how these things have been hacked to basically extract the Linux out of it and make it run emulators so that you can even play Super Nintendo games on your NES Classic Mini.
7460000	7466000	These things are not online, so they cannot be patched out, the exploits, through a simple firmware update.
7466000	7473000	Now, I don't necessarily want to start The Sky is Falling, but I have a feeling, and I don't put it past Nintendo to do it.
7473000	7481000	Nintendo might be closing up whatever exploits these guys are using right now before they're going to put more of them out.
7481000	7486000	That's what I think is happening. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe there's no reason for Nintendo to do this.
7486000	7494000	It could be a miscommunication. I don't think they would do that. I don't think they're going to bother doing that, because most people aren't doing that.
7494000	7500000	Maybe they're not going to do it because they're just going to move it to the Nintendo Switch and they want people to buy a Nintendo Switch. I don't see that either, though.
7500000	7504000	Why would you even want to do that? Because the average consumer is not going to know how to do that.
7504000	7511000	And the ones that do know how to do that, if you patch that up, they're just going to fucking run it on a Raspberry Pi or something.
7511000	7520000	Who cares? It's Linux. And even still, just because it's a Linux system that's running in the first place, good luck patching that.
7520000	7524000	You're not going to patch it. It's fucking Linux. That shit's going to be broken open.
7524000	7530000	You're just going to waste time and effort and money patching something up that's just going to get broken immediately.
7530000	7540000	Again, I have nothing to base that on. That's just my... Why would a retailer think they're not going to get any more and then suddenly they are going to get more?
7540000	7548000	I mean, it could be just as simple as, this guy didn't know what he was talking about. Sorry, that's so harsh, but that may be what it ends up being, a bad miscommunication or something.
7549000	7555000	But I could see where Nintendo might put the brakes on for a bit to fix... That just seems like a very Nintendo thing to do.
7555000	7563000	That there will be a version B of the NES Classic Mini or something that does not allow the same workaround that they're doing right now.
7563000	7568000	But hackers are going to hack and they'll find another way, just like Loki said, so it's probably not worth their time.
7569000	7571000	Loki, moving on.
7571000	7579000	Alright, so Microsoft is promising that there's going to be more Xbox One and Windows 10 exclusive games that are going to be highlighted.
7579000	7585000	Of course, they're saying Sea of Thieves, State of Decay 2, and Crackdown 3 are some of those.
7585000	7591000	That there's also going to be some more stuff in store at E3 2017 that they're going to announce.
7591000	7598000	So expect more of those really annoying Windows 10, Xbox One exclusive.
7598000	7601000	Which is really just any of their first party games. I mean, come on.
7601000	7605000	Do we really need to say it's exclusive if Microsoft's making them?
7605000	7608000	Well, maybe they'll get some from other people.
7608000	7611000	Or I'm sorry, Capcom, in the case of Dead Rising.
7611000	7616000	Or their scale bal- Oh, wait, sorry. Sore spot, sorry.
7616000	7618000	Phantom Dust, no.
7619000	7624000	Yeah, it would maybe help for there to be more exclusives that they'd stop being cancelled.
7624000	7632000	That's kind of funny, though. It just reminds me that Crackdown 3 then would be on PC, so maybe I don't need to get an Xbox One.
7632000	7638000	I was planning on buying a better PC anyways, or laptop, so hey.
7638000	7643000	And how's the Scorpio thing going to change things? Because I imagine Microsoft is eyeing doing something.
7643000	7646000	And maybe that's why they've been sitting on Crackdown.
7646000	7651000	They're going to do something that's really going to push the limits of Scorpio, yet it still runs on Xbox One and Windows 10.
7651000	7653000	Because that's the deal, right?
7653000	7657000	Maybe they can do all that physics stuff that they were planning on doing through the cloud.
7657000	7659000	Remember cloud, cloud, cloud, cloud, cloud? You know, all that stuff.
7659000	7664000	So maybe now all the physics stuff can be done natively without having to be always online or something.
7664000	7665000	Maybe.
7665000	7669000	Maybe they can run PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 1 games.
7669000	7676000	Wouldn't that be something if Microsoft came out and said you could run PlayStation games?
7676000	7680000	Wouldn't the patent on PlayStation hardware be expiring soon?
7680000	7682000	Nah, it'll be 2019, I think.
7682000	7684000	Bleem 3.0, 2.0?
7684000	7686000	Bleem 3.0. Alright, anyway.
7686000	7692000	One more story for you guys tonight. Do you guys know the song Pac-Man Fever, that classic song from the 80s?
7692000	7696000	It's in rotation here at VOG Network, but I'm sure not a lot of you sit here and listen to the music all day at VOG.
7696000	7698000	But you guys probably remember the song, right, from the 80s?
7698000	7702000	Well, you know, there were a lot of parody songs written about video games back in the day,
7702000	7707000	but you might wonder, like, well, where was the king of parody songs, Weird Al Yankovic, in all this?
7707000	7712000	Well, it turns out Weird Al did write a song called Pac-Man.
7712000	7718000	And in an interview with The Nerdist this week, he talks about how Pac-Man is now going to be coming to a new box set,
7718000	7722000	like a rarity set that's coming out from Weird Al, called Squeeze Box.
7722000	7724000	Oh yeah, the Squeeze Box. That's awesome.
7724000	7732000	Yeah, Pac-Man is a parody of The Beatles' Taxman, and it's not that this song was never heard before.
7732000	7737000	In fact, they even have it. You can actually stream it here on Vevo. You can actually hear the whole song.
7737000	7744000	I can play a little clip of it here. So you can see it's like a parody of Taxman.
7744000	7754000	Anyway, so this song, and this is from early Weird Al Yankovic, right?
7754000	7758000	So this is like when he was doing another one, Ride to the Bus and My Bologna.
7758000	7766000	But these songs were, like, on The Dr. Domeno Show, you know, back when, like, he was huge on radio,
7766000	7771000	and, you know, he was awesome. Like, I've heard tapes of that old show, and there's some really, like, awesome stuff,
7771000	7777000	a lot of that parody stuff. So Pac-Man was heard on The Dr. Domeno Show, so it's not that this song was never out there.
7777000	7783000	But because it was only ever played on the radio and not officially released on CD, you have a chance.
7783000	7788000	And Dr. Domeno had to stop playing it after the third or fourth time, because guess what happened?
7788000	7795000	The Beatles' lawyers sent a cease and desist about that whole thing. So Dr. Domeno had to stop playing that song.
7795000	7801000	But now, apparently, they've worked it out, I guess the same way that you can do Beatles music on Spotify now.
7801000	7802000	It's just very useful.
7802000	7809000	Yeah, some folks have changed their tune, I don't know. So now this song is going to be available on Weird Al's box set.
7809000	7815000	So, very cool. As Joe and Hunter Matt points out, the squeeze box is in the shape of an accordion, I think.
7815000	7817000	Well, that would be appropriate for Weird Al Yankovic, would it not?
7817000	7818000	Mm-hmm.
7818000	7827000	There it is. You can check out Weird Al's. If you want to hear the whole song, the Pac-Man parody, it's actually up on Vevo, which is basically their YouTube now.
7827000	7829000	So, check that out.
7830000	7835000	That is going to do it for the stories we have on deck tonight, so I think it's time to open up the Skype line.
7835000	7841000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, if you want to give us a call and talk about anything we've talked about tonight,
7841000	7844000	or maybe something we didn't get to tonight.
7844000	7849000	We did talk about moments that you love in video games. You can share some of the love with us here on the Skype line if you want.
7849000	7852000	Again, that's Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
7852000	7857000	While we wait for the phone to ring, although I would always encourage, if you've never called the show before,
7857000	7862000	Echo 123 is a good place to call first to make sure your Skype connection is working.
7862000	7866000	Loki, while we wait for some calls, do you have any last minute stories for us?
7867000	7875000	I was just going to mention that the Dirt Rally game, they put out their VR DLC, so you can actually check that out now.
7875000	7881000	And if you don't have Dirt Rally, you can actually pick it up with the VR expansion for like $37.
7881000	7886000	So I'm kind of wondering if it's any good, because I'm kind of looking for more games for the PlayStation VR,
7886000	7892000	and I do like racing games, although I'm not good at them, so I'd look for more of an arcade racing game.
7892000	7895000	I'm curious to see how Dirt Rally is.
7895000	7899000	Alright, we do have the phone ringing, so let's get to it.
7899000	7901000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
7902000	7904000	Hi, this is Taro Koon.
7904000	7908000	Hi Taro Koon, what's up? I don't recognize the name, are you a new caller to the show?
7908000	7913000	Yeah, I'm a new caller, long time listener though, I love the show.
7913000	7916000	Thank you, long time listener, first time caller, hooray. What's on your mind?
7916000	7920000	Yeah, I want to talk about the Switch.
7920000	7931000	I don't like that Nintendo wants you to pay for a lot of things you might not care about in the Switch package.
7931000	7932000	How so?
7932000	7943000	Like, why not have a package that's almost like a Vita, where you don't have the dock for your house?
7943000	7951000	I mean, maybe even one where it's just the tablet and it would be like, you know, $150 or something.
7951000	7960000	I see, so you're kind of going back to some of those early, you might remember some of the early rumors about Project NX a few months ago is what we were all calling it.
7960000	7966000	One of the earliest rumors was that it was going to be a separate handheld and television system that was one ecosystem.
7966000	7974000	I'll tell you why they're not doing it. It's because, I know what you're thinking, your thought process is that they're charging $90 for that dock.
7974000	7976000	There's not $90 worth of hardware in that dock.
7976000	7977000	Exactly.
7977000	7979000	It's a piece of plastic.
7979000	7989000	I don't know. I'm not as bothered by that whole thing. I can understand the whole thing to make it universal, but again, it's weird to me that they won't sell it as a portable system.
7989000	7996000	They're not marketing it as a portable system when I think that most of its strengths are as a portable system, but that's just me.
7996000	8014000	Yeah, and they could even have cheaper versions of the Joy-Cons or something, but then they would have problems selling games like 1-2 Switch and maybe they would split their market if they don't pack it all.
8014000	8018000	Everybody has the same system in the box.
8018000	8026000	So let me ask this question. Despite all this frustration with what Nintendo's doing, did you pre-order a Switch? Are you going to get one?
8026000	8040000	Oh, no. I really wish. I totally would get one and would pre-order one. I'm a big Nintendo fan. I figure I would get one and just buy the good games as they come out.
8040000	8053000	As it is right now, I'm going to be waiting until holiday and they'll probably have more games and more online features and a full-featured console by that time.
8053000	8064000	Some comments in chat over at live.vognetwork.com. YYR is saying, the problem with Switch without Joy-Cons is that you can't play it, but pro controllers won't play all games. The Joy-Cons are the standard controller.
8065000	8072000	Yeah, I do sort of get that. It's kind of like the Wii in that regard. They do want to have the standard controller set or whatever.
8072000	8084000	I guess it's kind of one of those things where at the end of the day, just have the games that justify it or have the features that gamers want to have.
8084000	8092000	I don't know, a virtual console or online virtual console, something I've been talking about for a while, which sounds like we might finally be getting with the Switch.
8092000	8094000	That part's exciting if nothing else.
8097000	8105000	Yeah, exactly. The moment they showed the HD rumble and all this stuff packed into the controllers, I'm like, yeah, that's impressive.
8105000	8114000	But I don't think Zelda uses half of these things or Skyrim is going to tell you how many rocks your character is holding.
8115000	8122000	Zelda will probably use all these features in one way or another. It might not be an intricate part of the game because, again, it has to exist on Wii U as well.
8122000	8131000	But Nintendo really will go out of their way to justify their Nintendo ideas. And so I think it's more of a given you're going to see this on Zelda even.
8134000	8139000	We'll see. I mean, we'll see. Nintendo's not telling us much, but we'll know in about a week and a half.
8140000	8141000	Yeah.
8141000	8142000	All right.
8142000	8145000	I don't want to tie up your line here.
8145000	8150000	No worries. I appreciate the call. Thanks for giving us your perspective. Take care and thanks for listening.
8150000	8152000	Okay, thank you.
8152000	8153000	Yep, have a good one.
8153000	8154000	Have a great evening.
8154000	8159000	Bye. All right. Thank you for the call. That was Taro-kun, if I remember right.
8160000	8168000	OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype if you want to give us a call and say hello. Maybe you're very happy about the Switch and you can't wait for it.
8168000	8174000	And you wish all of us would see it from your perspective. Feel free to call in and share. OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype.
8174000	8177000	Any other last minute stories to check in on, Loki, while we wait?
8179000	8188000	You'd mentioned, well, this is regarding that email that you kept getting about Liquid Sky, what that was.
8188000	8196000	Somebody fucking signed me up for that. What is that? I get these emails and this has been happening to me a lot lately where on my personal email I'm getting signed up for things.
8196000	8206000	You know, somebody's probably just fucking with me but I just, you know, you have to confirm your email address so I just keep saying no or deleting your spam.
8206000	8209000	So this is the latest one I get and I'm like, what's this gaming thing?
8209000	8220000	It's like on live or something like that but with PC games. So you sign up and then you basically stream their games from their servers.
8220000	8225000	Do you have to pay money for it? Somebody pay money and use my email? Can I borrow it?
8225000	8231000	Well, they have like ads supported so that one's free and you get to play three hours a day.
8231000	8233000	That's still a lot.
8233000	8242000	Do you have any unused, I guess, credits roll over? And then there's also the pay-as-you-go which is $4.99 and then $9.99 a month.
8242000	8245000	Yes, but can I play Zork on it like I could on GameTap?
8245000	8251000	I have no idea. But apparently you have to have a beta key in order to redeem it to play that so I don't know.
8251000	8259000	Interesting. So somebody's, oh my god, alright. Anyway, somebody did the same thing with a Microsoft account on my personal email this week.
8259000	8264000	And my Microsoft account is actually through a secondary email that I have. So it's like somebody's trying to sign me up on my primary email.
8264000	8268000	I'm like, nope. And so I went in and I deleted the account. I reset the password and deleted the account.
8268000	8275000	It's like I don't get why websites let you sign up just using an email address without having to confirm said email address.
8275000	8279000	Especially something like Microsoft. Jesus Christ. Very irritating.
8279000	8287000	Anyway, Orange Launch Radio, last call. All one word on Skype or 1-877-GAME-OLR if you want to do it the old-fashioned way.
8287000	8292000	Let's see. What was the other comment here I wanted to read in chat? It was about the Weird Al thing.
8292000	8297000	Somebody had said, oh yes. Smexyvan, I hope I said that right. Smexyvan in chat said,
8297000	8303000	Love, love Weird Al. Certain songs are ruined for me because of his parodies though. I can't listen to American Pie.
8303000	8310000	That's true. Like, I can't listen to Happy by Pharrell Williams anymore without thinking of Tacky.
8310000	8318000	I see that video of Weird Al and Margaret Cho and Aisha Tyler and all them dancing. That's all I see whenever I hear that song right now.
8318000	8323000	Weird Al kind of does ruin songs. But did he ruin them though? Or did he make them better?
8323000	8331000	Because I would argue in the case of Foil from that same album or even Word Crimes, he made those songs better.
8331000	8332000	Word Crimes are pretty awesome.
8332000	8333000	He made those songs better.
8333000	8335000	That was an awesome video too.
8335000	8339000	That's just my thought. Anyway, we do have one more call coming in over on the Skypline so let's get to it.
8339000	8341000	Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio. Who's this?
8344000	8346000	Hello, you're on Orange Lawns Radio. Who's this?
8346000	8348000	Hello, this is Smexyvan.
8348000	8350000	Hi, Smexyvan. What's on your mind tonight?
8350000	8356000	Wait, what is? This is like the night of new callers tonight. I like that. I'm all good with that. What's on your mind tonight?
8360000	8368000	Oh, well, I was just reading. I was just listening and reading your comments on my Weird Al comments on the live chat.
8369000	8380000	We must have a heck of a lag thing going on right now, but that's alright. What is on your mind? You hearing us talk about video games? What's your opinions on what we talked about tonight?
8385000	8388000	Oh, well, sorry. Is that better with the...
8389000	8395000	The volume's better, but we still have pretty horrific lag, but that's the joy of doing live radio. But we'll try to push through it.
8395000	8398000	It is pretty chaotic. Well, I'm calling from Japan.
8399000	8405000	That could do it. Calling from Japan might be a bit. Say hi to AkumaJP while you're there.
8406000	8411000	Well, try to get your thoughts out for us here. We'll try to deal best we can with the lag. What's on your mind in gaming this week?
8411000	8428000	Well, I was just calling on your comments on Weird Al. It wasn't that I meant that the songs were ruined for me by Weird Al's communities. It's actually really funny.
8429000	8435000	We were driving, and American Pie came on the radio, and I was just laughing my ass off.
8435000	8445000	Okay, I see. So, you were calling to clarify your comments and defend Weird Al Yankovic, which I understand Weird Al Yankovic should be defended.
8446000	8459000	Look, I'm not a stupid nerd. I realize that Weird Al Yankovic is kind of like one of the popes of nerds. Do the nerds have a pope? If they do, it's probably Weird Al Yankovic, and I know better than to sacrilege him.
8459000	8468000	But I'm just saying, he does have that tendency to do some songs that you can't hear the original anymore. All you hear is Weird Al versions.
8469000	8475000	Like, Pharrell Williams' Happy isn't a bad song. I like that song, but I still hear Tacky. That's all I'm ever gonna hear.
8476000	8478000	All I hear is Gump. I never hear Lump anymore.
8478000	8488000	Exactly! It seems like that. But in the case of Word Crimes, I would actually argue he probably did make that song better, actually. I don't even want to hear the other one.
8489000	8505000	With Word Crimes, there was actually a group of female law students that posted a parody of Word Crimes on YouTube. Oh god, it's gone. It was there for a week, and it was the funniest shit ever.
8506000	8522000	Pardon my language. I'm assuming the students themselves removed it, because I think they were a group of female law students, and they were in suits, and they instead had some hot boys in underwear.
8523000	8528000	God, I wish I could remember the lyrics. It was a really good parody, but I liked that better than Weird Al's parody.
8529000	8530000	Maybe they were worried about their careers getting...
8531000	8532000	Yeah, that was probably it.
8532000	8534000	I can see that. I can see that.
8535000	8539000	But I'm sure it's hiding in some internet nest egg somewhere.
8540000	8544000	Once on the internet, always on the internet. That's before y'all put videos on the internet. Be careful.
8545000	8552000	But I was gonna say, wouldn't it be ironic if Weird Al had sued to get the parody taken down? That would be ironic. He would never do that. He would never do that, anyway.
8553000	8555000	Yeah, I don't think so.
8555000	8566000	We actually did a fun story. One of the Dragon Cons, my pal Travis Donovan from Under Station Live, rest in peace, who helped me get my start in this whole internet broadcasting thing.
8567000	8575000	Not in broadcasting in general. I did that in college. Travis thinks I own that too, but I gotta keep him in check a little bit, but obviously I miss him and his show.
8575000	8583000	But the reason why I bring him up is that there was one Dragon Con when that Tacky came out and that whole album that Weird Al did.
8584000	8594000	We actually did a party on the Thursday night that was called Tacky, where we all dressed up in Tacky outfits and we went around the hotels and the whole circuit at Dragon Con with that song blaring behind us.
8595000	8598000	It was actually a lot of fun. Really, really ridiculous and stupid, but a lot of fun.
8599000	8602000	Thankfully, nobody filmed it, though, because I don't need my mother seeing that outfit on the YouTubes.
8605000	8614000	Exactly. All right. Let's see. Kaijuto in chat says this is a call from 2009 that finally caught up to 2017 because of the lag.
8615000	8621000	Look, he's a long ways away and first time into the show. Anyway, I'm gonna go ahead and let you go, though, so we can wrap things up.
8622000	8624000	But thanks for calling the show and thanks for listening.
8627000	8629000	Wait for it. Wait for it.
8629000	8637000	OK, well, hopefully the poor guy will hear this on the other end. Thanks for calling and listening. I hung up, though, because the lag, I guess, got too bad.
8638000	8644000	But hopefully you'll hear that pleasant goodbye there. We do have the phone ringing again, so let's get to this. Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio. Who's this?
8645000	8646000	Hey, Rob. What's up?
8647000	8650000	Rama, we had all new callers tonight and then you had to call it. I'm just kidding.
8650000	8663000	Yeah, well, if somebody wasn't busting balls about a particular snack product who got someone that got quite excited over what I posted when I first got it, well, maybe I wouldn't have had to call it.
8664000	8668000	Yeah. Luckily, you did the right thing tonight and you bought my favor.
8670000	8671000	And those are terrible.
8671000	8681000	I had to put that fucking bag in the other room because I was eating them all and I was like, there's not going to be any left for Alan when he gets home, except he'll know that I ate them because I gained five pounds overnight.
8682000	8687000	The stuff's made with real liquor, so you probably gained closer to seven.
8688000	8697000	I already did, Rama. I had enough liquor last night, let me just say. I don't drink that much very often, but once every few months, I look out and last night was one of those nights.
8698000	8700000	You went to a convention?
8701000	8703000	No, no, that's great. It was a birthday party.
8703000	8704000	Oh, close enough.
8704000	8715000	Yeah, better yet, I went to a gay bar for a birthday party. I don't ever go out to gay bars anymore, it feels like, but I went out last night and I drank a lot. A lot. Rama was a lot.
8715000	8716000	But was it tasty, tasty booze, though?
8716000	8718000	God, yes, it was tasty, tasty.
8719000	8721000	Then I don't see what the problem is.
8721000	8725000	Me neither. All right, the hangover, that's the problem. All right, what's on your mind tonight, Rama?
8725000	8728000	Nothing. I just came to bust your balls about the Stroopwafel.
8729000	8738000	I like that we're getting these calls tonight where it's like, I just wanted to call in to defend Weird Al Yankovic, or I just wanted to call to defend the Stroopwafels or whatever it is.
8738000	8741000	It was okay, but I think my expectations were too high.
8741000	8743000	Maybe, I don't see how there is.
8743000	8749000	It's kind of like when I hear about a Nintendo product coming out and then actually try it and then you just have to lower those expectations.
8749000	8753000	Here's the thing. You need to also realize this. Loki never eats the food we give him.
8753000	8760000	Like, Darsaka can be like, I baked a delicious red velvet cake, da-da-da. Loki won't eat it because he's a picky eater, which is fine. I can be a picky eater too.
8760000	8762000	You just don't like eating tons of cake.
8762000	8765000	Yeah, but he ate the Stroopwafel.
8765000	8773000	No, no, no. If you want Loki to eat a cake, you've got to have a bacon weave topping on the cake.
8773000	8783000	No, you don't. No, you don't. Seriously, I was always on board with bacon on desserts and stuff, like bacon donuts, for example.
8783000	8789000	Honestly, bacon donuts, all they did was give me the love maple donuts, and I don't need the bacon.
8789000	8796000	The bacon does not enhance the donut that well. There's just some things. It's just bacon with a maple donut.
8796000	8799000	And yeah, that's always good, because bacon is always good.
8799000	8806000	But it doesn't necessarily make the donut any better. It's just it's bacon and the maple donut. And I love maple donuts. They're like my favorite now.
8806000	8812000	I don't know, man. There's a convention I go to, and there is a farmer's market right next door.
8812000	8822000	And every year, I go there and I buy four bacon maple donuts, because they're not open on Sundays. And believe you me, they taste amazing with the bacon on it.
8822000	8824000	What convention's this? I want to go to a convention.
8824000	8826000	Farmer's market and anime convention.
8826000	8828000	Farmer's market and anime convention.
8828000	8835000	It's Zenkai Con, right in Lancaster County. You go outside the hotel, next block over, farmer's market.
8835000	8839000	Wait a minute, Lancaster, Pennsylvania? Isn't that Amish country out there?
8839000	8840000	Yes.
8840000	8843000	Oh my god, so this is Amish farmer's market then?
8843000	8844000	Yes.
8844000	8848000	Oh shit. I bet that's pretty awesome.
8848000	8850000	Oh yes indeed.
8850000	8854000	You know the Amish are known for their maple bacon donuts.
8854000	8855000	I know, right?
8855000	8863000	I mean, you, see, when me and Muck, when we make the drive, you pass their theme park Dutch Wonderland as you're going there.
8863000	8879000	That's amazing. What about, what was the place, oh my god, there was a theme park, and people may not know this, but I spend a lot of time, my old job, I spent at least six weeks in three different trips out in Allentown. Dorney Park. That was it.
8879000	8882000	Dorney Park, Wild Water Kingdom is still there.
8882000	8896000	It's still there. Yeah, there was a hotel right across the street, and I've spent like six weeks of my life in that hotel, always just longingly looking at the theme park, but being stuck at work. It was usually like, I don't even think the theme park was open. Was it one of those seasonal places?
8896000	8900000	No, but are you sure it wasn't Sesame Place?
8900000	8905000	No, it was not Sesame Place. I distinctly remember this theme park, because I could see it from my window.
8905000	8907000	Yeah, it was definitely Dorney Park, Wild Water Kingdom.
8907000	8917000	Yeah, yeah, that's fun, and I never went there in all the time that I spent out there. I never went to a damn theme park, but I think that was one of the trips I went to ate on the break, and I think we met up out there or something.
8917000	8922000	Yeah, me and my friends, we took you to a traditional Jersey diner for food.
8922000	8931000	Yes, yes, I remember that, and I was like, you guys, when you do this to me, I'm not going to go back and have jokes to tell about New Jersey, because I was like, you know what, New Jersey isn't so bad.
8931000	8946000	Look, everybody bags on Jersey, the landfill state, Chris Christie and all that, no matter what. Jersey has one saving face, and it's not Bruce Springsteen, it's the fact that Jersey is the biggest exporter of diners all over.
8946000	8955000	No matter where you go in Jersey, you can walk two blocks, three blocks, whatever, you will find a diner, and if you don't like that one, there's another one you can go to.
8955000	8969000	And they don't have diners in California like they have back east, they really don't. It's all chains, it's like Denny's, or now the new one is Big Bear, Black Bear? Big Bear? They're everywhere now, showing up everywhere.
8969000	8981000	They're not bad, they're not the same. Mel's maybe is the closest thing to a diner, but even Mel's is kind of like, I don't know, they're all chains, Rama, it's not the same like it is back east.
8982000	8989000	Believe you me, I know, there was a really good diner not too far from my house, but it closed about a couple of years ago, so, sad.
8989000	8997000	Yeah, sad. sj100matt says, so basically what needs to happen is Rob needs to come back to New York. Well Rama, since you're on the line, I might as well address this.
8997000	9005000	So it turns out, y'all might remember, I have a friend that lives out in that area, she lived out in Connecticut, and that's one of the reasons I ended up in New York one of my trips out there.
9005000	9009000	So I just found out she's getting married this October, so guess what that means?
9011000	9020000	When in October? 13th question mark? God damn it, Rob! Is there a fucking convention then or something?
9020000	9026000	No, I'm going to Colorado for somebody at the wedding. Rama, you son of a bitch!
9027000	9038000	Hey, fuck you man, I got an invite, I got the most awesome save the date card ever. It wasn't to pick a picture of two people lovingly in each other's arms and eyes saying come to our wedding.
9038000	9049000	No, it was just written on there with nice print that said save the date with awesome decorations on it, it's going to be a freaking party, it's going to be sci-fi themed, I am going.
9049000	9054000	I haven't got wait, so that's funny, so you're going to be out here for a wedding as well?
9054000	9070000	No, Denver, but you know. Westward. Now I'm actually going through my text messages to see if I actually can find the text message that had the date in it because you're yelling at me so much that I want to make sure I'm right on this.
9070000	9079000	I'm only yelling because I care and love you. I know you do. Hugs and kisses. Fuck, I can't find the text message now where she sent me the date.
9079000	9086000	This is really important stuff to be talking about on our video game based radio show, but you know what?
9086000	9091000	It's a special time of the show where we call it real life stuff.
9091000	9095000	Exactly, and getting out to New York is a very important topic.
9095000	9100000	Yes indeed, because there is this awesome bar I want to take you to and get you drunk.
9101000	9109000	Alright, I will clarify the date. I'm going to find out. October 13th, getting married on Friday the 13th in October just sounds like something she'd do.
9109000	9114000	My youngest sister got married on Halloween, so that doesn't surprise me in the least.
9114000	9119000	But anyway, I'll find out the date and let you know, but it looks like I am going to have to go out to the East Coast this year.
9119000	9126000	Like finally, I'm being forced to go out that way. Which you know, oh no, I so don't want to go, help.
9127000	9130000	Well, yeah.
9130000	9136000	Alright, well I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show my friend. I think everybody is sick of hearing us talk about our business.
9136000	9140000	But you know what? Again, you bought my favorite tonight with Stroopwafel, so there you go.
9140000	9143000	Alright, take care my friend.
9143000	9144000	You too, stay fabulous.
9144000	9146000	You too, bye.
9147000	9151000	Alright, we're going to go ahead and close up the Skype line here.
9151000	9154000	If you didn't get through and you wanted to talk to us, you can always send us an email.
9154000	9156000	Participate at OrangeLawnTrader.com
9156000	9162000	SSJ100Matt says in chat, it's been like 12 years since Rob was there. I had hair back then.
9162000	9164000	Yeah, you and me both buddy. You and me both.
9164000	9168000	It was a long time ago. I think my last trip out there was like 2008.
9168000	9171000	So maybe not 12 years, but probably a good 10.
9171000	9174000	So yeah, I got to get back out there for sure.
9174000	9178000	But it's going to happen this year. I'm really going to have to go to this wedding.
9178000	9182000	So I'll make it a point to visit New York City while I'm there.
9182000	9184000	The big question is, will I be able to bring Alan?
9184000	9188000	Because I'd really like to be able to bring Alan, but I'll have to get him on a plane for that.
9188000	9193000	Alright, anyhow, that's going to wrap it up for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
9193000	9196000	Thank you guys so much for listening to our show this week.
9196000	9200000	If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, please tell a friend or five about the show.
9200000	9203000	Help us spread the word because again, we are just a small independent podcast.
9203000	9208000	We don't have a lot of big money or advertising dollars or things to spend on the show.
9208000	9210000	Word of mouth really goes a long way.
9210000	9215000	If you can't think of anyone to tell, you can always leave a nice five star review on a place like iTunes or Google Play podcast.
9215000	9219000	Wherever you heard about this show, that word of mouth goes an awful long way.
9219000	9226000	So yeah, would really appreciate all those kind words.
9227000	9233000	So anyway, we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought here in studio.
9233000	9239000	DarkSakura's final thought, she's not here, it would be, just kidding, feel better DarkSakura.
9239000	9243000	I tease because I love. We'll try to save some Stroopwafel, I promise.
9243000	9245000	Loki, your final thought tonight?
9245000	9249000	My final thought is I was trying to work on programming this week.
9249000	9258000	I did some programming. I was trying to, because work stuff, you know, because I mentioned gaming related.
9258000	9266000	I don't, you know, really see, but we were having a PowerPoint presentation and PowerPoint's not that exciting.
9266000	9271000	So I thought, hey, wouldn't it be awesome if I could make a game that could do a PowerPoint presentation sort of,
9271000	9275000	or use the game as like an FPS PowerPoint type thing.
9276000	9281000	But then I wanted to play Skyrim and then, you know, unfortunately that's what takes over, so.
9281000	9282000	Of course, of course.
9282000	9287000	But I have code on my screen that I wrote that maybe I will work on.
9287000	9288000	Something.
9288000	9290000	I just, my will is very weak.
9290000	9291000	All right.
9291000	9292000	I have no will.
9292000	9295000	My final thought is three day weekend. Woo!
9295000	9298000	So maybe I'll be doing some livestream tomorrow. I don't know.
9298000	9301000	We're supposed to get another one of those storms of the century tomorrow, though.
9301000	9306000	So I just want to, can I just get in the car and drive somewhere where it won't be raining?
9307000	9308000	I guess not.
9308000	9310000	Anyway, we'll be back in seven days to do it all over again.
9310000	9313000	Thanks so much, you guys, for tuning into Orange Lounge Radio tonight.
