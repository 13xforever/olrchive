21760	25760	of tonight's news, stay tuned for this and so much more starting right now in the show
25760	31760	where every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio
31760	34760	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
34760	39760	where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight on the February
39760	46760	of 26th, 2017 with episode number 677 of our program. My name is Rob Roberts joining you
46760	52760	live here at the Voice Geeks Network, vognetwork.com where we tape every Sunday, we tape live
52760	57760	Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show
57760	62760	and we are here to talk about video games and gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle too
62760	66760	with me here in studio, welcome back DarkSakura, Jamie Summers
66760	67760	Why hello there
67760	68760	Hi how are you doing?
68760	69760	Better than last week
69760	74760	Yeah you don't sound so great but at least you look good
74760	75760	Well of course I look good
75760	77760	I always look good, I woke up like this
77760	78760	Girl
78760	83760	I gotta say also a big thank you and hugs and kisses to DarkSakura because this was
83760	88760	something she ran and picked up for me after the show two weeks ago when she was here because
88760	93760	she'd spotted them. This is like a Walmart exclusive which I don't set foot in Walmarts ever
93760	98760	If I could have helped it but I went and looked for him for Dan because he had been all hyper
98760	100760	We went to like three different fucking Walmarts looking for him
100760	105760	So what these are and if I do go to a Walmart, I go to the Walmart that they built here
105760	110760	We broadcast live in Sacramento, California and there is a Walmart in the middle of nowhere
110760	115760	Like literally in the back roads, like you're going to go to Elk Grove on the back roads for those that are local
115760	121760	Like there's literally a Walmart in the middle of nowhere, like I don't know who goes there but there's a Walmart there
121760	125760	And sure enough the Walmart in the middle of nowhere had the little arcade classic
125760	128760	You know all those little neighborhoods popped up around that area of Elk Grove
128760	134760	I think it's more built for the future because you know down here by, I don't want to give away where I live on the show
134760	137760	There's developments coming up nearby here too, anyway
137760	141760	So I was going to say these arcade classics, so this is pretty cool
141760	146760	So they're like little tiny cabinets, like arcade cabinets, like tiny arcade cabinets
146760	148760	I'm talking like the size of like a wallet
148760	149760	They're maybe what, eight inches high?
149760	153760	Yeah, yeah, they're not that big but they actually like they have a game inside them
153760	155760	So this one is what, this one's Qbert right?
155760	158760	Yeah, which I honestly think it might be the Colecovision version
158760	160760	It might be, they definitely look like old school computer versions
161760	163760	And then this one is Centipede actually
163760	165760	So I can actually, I can fire up the little demo
165760	168760	I don't know if you guys will be able to hear this okay, but you might be able to hear the little
168760	169760	Let's try
172760	173760	I don't know if they can hear that at all
173760	175760	But you can hear like the little background noises if I try to fire
175760	176760	Well I can hear it across the room
178760	181760	Maybe, it's very very quiet probably, sorry it doesn't come through very well
181760	187760	But yeah, and they're cute, they're like the screens on them are very tiny obviously
187760	192760	But this is something that I've seen like it seems to be a trend in the whole retro gaming thing
192760	196760	Because I guess this technology to make these little screen games is really cheap
196760	201760	Because I've seen now Atari flashbacks are coming on things that look like that
201760	205760	Where it's like a Game Boy micro or something, you remember that? The little micros?
205760	207760	I have a Game Boy micro
207760	208760	I know, they're a little bigger
208760	209760	Remember you used to carry it to E3 every year
209760	212760	I do, I do, but the screens are maybe a little bigger than that
212760	215760	Do you know that got me into a Nintendo thing once?
215760	216760	Did it really?
216760	217760	Yeah
217760	218760	No, I forgot about that
218760	220760	It was I think the last year that we went
220760	224760	Because the last year we went I had a media thing, it was the year before that
224760	227760	When I was like, someone's like, is that a Game Boy micro?
227760	228760	Yeah
228760	229760	You wanna come see this?
229760	231760	Sure
231760	235760	Hey Ashley since you weren't here last week, I don't even know if you heard this news
235760	237760	Did you hear about E3 opening up to the public?
237760	238760	Yeah, I knew about it
238760	240760	I was here when we talked about it the week before that
240760	242760	Oh that's right, last week was the follow up, sorry
242760	245760	Everything's a blur in gaming news you guys, sorry about that
245760	248760	So last week was the follow up that they hadn't sold out the tickets still
248760	253760	So not something you jumped on or are going to be going to
253760	256760	Good point, I'm kinda done with E3
256760	257760	Yeah
257760	258760	I mean it was fun
258760	261760	Stories like that I doubt are gonna happen anymore
261760	265760	If they do and we're wrong, awesome, we'll try to go next year
265760	267760	You know, but I just, you know, maybe
267760	271760	I'm still wanting to go to, I wanna go to a real convention
271760	272760	No
272760	274760	Since we're not having gamer X this year apparently
274760	277760	No, sad, well there's MagWest, that's probably the contender out here
277760	280760	I love MagFest though, and you know what really cracked me up?
280760	281760	I'm gonna go to DragCon
281760	284760	So I know you don't wanna talk politics on the show, but I'm just gonna mention
284760	286760	Me not wanna talk politics
286760	292760	But it was in the news that the guy who happens to reside in the White House right now
292760	295760	Was speaking at an event, right, did this whole speech thing
295760	300760	And the whole thing with that, that thing, he was in National Harbor, Maryland
300760	303760	He was at the exact same hotel where MagFest is at, that whole thing
303760	305760	Was at the same hotel where MagFest is at
305760	310760	So it kinda cracked me up knowing that, you know, the president saying whatever he's saying
310760	313760	I wasn't listening, on that stage, and I'm like
313760	317760	Gosh, that's where like, all these bands were playing
317760	321760	Like Bit Brigade was playing like just four weeks ago
321760	323760	I have to say something to Bob Coffee
323760	324760	Yeah
324760	326760	I'm not going to Anime Expo ever again
326760	327760	You've been before
327760	331760	I used to go, I went like five years in a row and cosplayed every time
331760	333760	My first AX was amazing
333760	338760	And then I went to the one at Disneyland Hotel where we had the DDR third mix
338760	341760	I was gonna say, you got hooked into DDR thanks to Anime Expo, right?
341760	344760	I played DDR and Combat Boots in 1999
344760	350760	It just got to be way too overly commercialized
350760	353760	I mean, Anime now is super commercialized anyway
353760	356760	But it wasn't quite the same thing where you'd go and you'd find
356760	359760	Like the people selling the Japanese laser discs or, you know
359760	362760	All of the, you know, real import stuff
362760	366760	Or the Avextrax CDs because I loaded up on Avextrax CDs
366760	369760	And it's just not what it was
369760	372760	And I broke a wing my last year at AX
372760	375760	Because that was my Angel Sanctuary cosplay
375760	377760	So, I'm kinda done
377760	379760	Fanime is a little bit better
379760	381760	But I haven't been to Fanime in a while
382760	384760	When was the last convention you went to?
384760	385760	GameRx
385760	386760	Oh yeah, GameRx, of course
386760	388760	You haven't gone to a lot though
388760	389760	No, not really
389760	392760	I hadn't even cosplayed this year because I was so mad at the cosplay contest
392760	397760	But I'm hoping I can make it to the convention I've been working on
397760	401760	All of their material for since it just started DerpyCon
401760	405760	One of these days I'd like to actually visit the convention I've been doing the guidebook for every year
405760	407760	That's New Jersey?
407760	408760	Yeah
408760	410760	I think Rama would love to have you out there
410760	411760	I'd like to
411760	413760	Shoot, I just want to go to New York really
413760	415760	Send me to New York somebody
415760	417760	All of y'all on the East Coast
417760	420760	Maybe get 50 bucks a person and y'all can fly me out
420760	422760	Start your GoFundMe
422760	424760	This is my Kickstarter
424760	425760	Alright, anyway
425760	426760	Bask in my presence
426760	427760	I hate to ignore
427760	429760	We had to catch up with Jamie though since she was out last week
429760	431760	But I hate to ignore her over there of course here in studio as always
431760	432760	Techmaster Loki
432760	433760	Hello
433760	434760	Hi Loki, how are you?
434760	435760	Fine
435760	437760	What do you think of these little arcade thingies?
437760	440760	Are these, is this the sort of thing that interests you or are you like, nah it's cheap?
440760	442760	I'd buy one and take one apart
444760	446760	That's a very Loki way of putting things
446760	448760	Actually, well and that was the other thing I didn't mention about these things
448760	450760	These things were only 20 bucks a pop
450760	452760	That's the thing, that technology is like so cheap now
452760	455760	Those Atari flashbacks are what, like 40, 50 bucks?
455760	457760	I don't know, they're not that expensive
457760	460760	And I see these all the time now
460760	462760	I was at the mall yesterday
462760	466760	There's a, what's that new store that's popping up with all the nerdy stuff
466760	468760	BoxLunch, is that what it's called?
468760	469760	Hot Topic?
469760	471760	No, well I think it's the same people that run them
471760	472760	Spencer's?
472760	474760	No, I think it's BoxLunch is what it's called
474760	476760	Spencer's is disgusting now
476760	478760	I don't even think they have that at our mall
478760	480760	Yeah, they have it at Sunrise still
480760	481760	No, there's Spencer's at Sunrise
481760	482760	Who goes there? Anyway
482760	483760	Disgusting people
483760	484760	Apparently I do
484760	486760	But what was I going to say about that whole thing?
486760	488760	Oh, so I was at the BoxLunch
488760	492760	Which sells, they have little sections dedicated to all the nerdom things, right?
492760	495760	There's a little Doctor Who section, there's a little Pokemon section
496760	501760	That's right, they do have one of those places down at the Paladio
501760	503760	They have a BoxLunch there
503760	504760	Oh, do they really? Okay, okay
504760	506760	Or something that is very similar to that
506760	508760	So of course I got a look in the gamer section
508760	510760	Because they have like gamer shirts
510760	512760	And there was of course a lot of Overwatch stuff
512760	514760	But I was like, oh maybe I want a D.Va shirt
514760	517760	And there was a Soldier 76 shirt I took a picture of and sent to Shane
517760	520760	Because he had gray hair at the time because he's in the process of dying it
520760	523760	But they also had, in their whole little gaming section
523760	529760	They had a little like mini, like 100 retro game thing
529760	531760	That was like one of these tiny screens
531760	533760	That was like probably something you'd put on a keychain
533760	536760	That had 100 retro games on it
536760	539760	Except they're all just like, I know they're garbage
539760	543760	Not things you recognize
543760	546760	Like this game looks like Pole Position
546760	547760	But it's not
547760	549760	And you know, they're not
549760	550760	It's Pole Poopsition
551760	553760	Exactly, it's Pole Poopsition
553760	555760	And 99 other games
555760	558760	It's like those old Nintendo carts that are like 250 games in one
558760	561760	Then the joke is, all the games suck
561760	563760	It's like one of those things
563760	566760	But anyway, I saw one of those
566760	569760	And I was like, those were pretty cheap too
569760	571760	So this is like this trend now in retro gaming
571760	574760	Is that the technology is so cheap for these tiny screens
574760	577760	We're probably gonna see even more of it in the coming years
577760	578760	I don't know
578760	582760	I wanna also of course introduce our chatroom over at live.vog.network.com
582760	585760	Again, live on Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific
585760	586760	We read your chat comments
586760	588760	And you can participate along with the show
588760	591760	And sometimes you guys drive what we talk about here on air
591760	595760	I know there's other stuff going on in the entertainment world this evening
595760	599760	But I mean, isn't it pretty clear what's gonna win Best Picture?
599760	600760	No, there's not
600760	602760	About 14 nominees, anyway
602760	606760	So thank you guys for being here even when there's other stuff going on
606760	609760	But Darth Tetsuya is talking about the flashback portable
609760	612760	Kind of looked almost like a PSP or something
612760	614760	But a bunch of Atari classics on it
614760	618760	I think it also supported SD card ROMs
618760	622760	I didn't even realize that if that's the case, that's pretty rad
622760	624760	If you can actually load ROMs on it too
624760	628760	And how big of an SD card do you need for Atari 2600 ROMs?
628760	632760	Last I checked, I mean this was a while back when I downloaded the full ROM
632760	635760	So it was like 6 megs, so it can't be that large
635760	637760	Atari ROMs are like 4 kilobytes
637760	642760	That's what made the programming on that system and the things that they did so fucking impressive
642760	645760	Is that they had no space to work with
645760	647760	With Atari 2600 games
647760	650760	So it's really amazing the stuff that they crammed
650760	655760	I mean, as much of a garbage translation as Pac-Man is versus the arcade
655760	658760	The whole reason why the Pac-Man turned out garbage
658760	664760	Is because Atari wanted it on a 4k ROM cartridge
664760	667760	As opposed to a more expensive 8k cartridge
667760	671760	Which I think when they did Ms. Pac-Man on Atari 2600
671760	674760	Like a couple years later before the big bust and everything
674760	676760	If you ever played Ms. Pac-Man on Atari 2600
676760	679760	It's fine, it's not exactly like the arcade
679760	683760	But it's much more what you would expect an arcade translation to look like on the 2600
683760	688760	But the 4k only ROM on Pac-Man, that's what killed that game
688760	691760	Is that the guy was so limited on what he could work with
691760	694760	It's like, he could only have it
694760	696760	The reason why the ghosts flicker
696760	700760	Is because it could only draw one ghost each frame
700760	702760	It couldn't draw four ghosts
702760	704760	So it draws this ghost, then this ghost
704760	706760	That's okay, it's transparency right?
706760	708760	That's why I always thought it was
708760	710760	It's flickering because they're transparent
711760	714760	Stop Ian Chat says it does support SD cart ROMs
714760	716760	But it's not 100% compatible
716760	718760	Well that's kind of, I didn't even know that
718760	720760	Like I'm learning something here on Tonight's OLR
720760	722760	I had no idea, because that means I could play that homebrew shit
722760	724760	Like Halo for the 2600
724760	727760	Or didn't some guy go in and fix ET?
727760	729760	Yeah they fixed ET
729760	730760	That was the thing we reported on
730760	732760	So you could play Stacks
732760	735760	That game that was part of the Ready Player One contest
735760	736760	Yes, yes
736760	739760	Yes, I don't know why that's so fucking rad
739760	741760	But it is, I don't know
742760	743760	Anyway, let's see
743760	746760	Dark Tetsuya says there's a homebrew version of Pac-Man that's way badder
746760	749760	It was based on the Ms. Pac-Man conversion
749760	751760	Yes, if you've ever played that, it's great
751760	753760	Did he just remove the bow and that's it?
754760	757760	I guess and change the pink to blue or whatever
757760	759760	He had to do to change, yeah probably
759760	763760	Oh thank you, Bobby Blackpool says there was only three ghosts in the Atari 2600 version
763760	764760	I forgot that
764760	766760	I forgot that there was even, they had to downplay the three ghosts
766760	767760	It's hard enough even on that
767760	769760	I know, I know, jeez
769760	772760	I still, I still, even though it was garbage
772760	774760	The thing is, when you're six years old
774760	777760	Which I think is how old I was when I was playing Pac-Man on the 2600
777760	778760	You don't give a fuck
778760	780760	Like you, you just don't, I don't know
780760	784760	Does your six year old care about graphics and accuracy of things?
784760	785760	Yes
786760	788760	Maybe the 80's was just a simpler time
788760	790760	Well they, they will just, but see now they're so
790760	792760	Like they know what Minecraft is
792760	794760	They don't know anything 8 bit or 16 bit
794760	796760	They're like, look daddy, Minecraft
797760	799760	I'm like no, that's just how games look
799760	802760	I'm like, you better be good, I'm gonna make you play the Colecovision over here
804760	806760	Let's see how, you think that's terrible
806760	807760	Well, hold on
807760	811760	Darsakra, how do you view Colecovision gaming as punishment?
811760	812760	I don't
813760	815760	Exactly, but that's the point
815760	817760	Is they play it because they're forced to play it
817760	819760	And then they, they learn to appreciate it
819760	820760	But they won't because
820760	823760	The Colecovision was the best system of its time, seriously
823760	826760	Do you know how many gamer parents I've heard say
826760	828760	I'm gonna raise my kids the right way
828760	831760	And for the first three months that they're gaming
831760	834760	They're not allowed to play anything but Atari 2600 and Colecovision
834760	835760	That's too late, he already has a tablet
835760	836760	Like for example
836760	838760	In the next three months they do Nintendo
838760	839760	Let me just put it this way, okay
839760	844760	Today, alone, today, he must have watched and played
845760	848760	He got up at six o'clock this morning
849760	855760	And watched four hours of Minecraft YouTube videos
856760	860760	He then played another couple hours of Minecraft on the Wii U
860760	866760	Followed by probably what was like another three hours of Minecraft YouTube videos
866760	868760	That's too much Minecraft
868760	872760	Exactly, he doesn't shut the fuck up about Minecraft
872760	875760	All the goddamn time, like dude
876760	878760	I know you like Minecraft
878760	879760	I like Minecraft somewhat
879760	882760	But I don't need to hear Minecraft every fucking second of the game
882760	886760	Just like Daddy, Daddy was the only one that would talk about Minecraft here on OLR for a long time
888760	893760	But I didn't like fill every moment with Minecraft talk
894760	897760	Dark Tetsuya wants to point out about that Pac-Man ROM hack thing
897760	899760	They did redo the mazes
899760	902760	Let's not forget the maze was different in Pac-Man versus Ms. Pac-Man
902760	906760	Ms. Pac-Man had, I don't know if this came over on the 2600 conversion, it's been too long
906760	908760	But I remember the arcade was like four different mazes
908760	911760	As you upgraded through the fruit, you got different mazes
911760	914760	That was the future, Loki, was different mazes
914760	916760	Anyway, let's see
916760	921760	Stoppy in chat pointing out the Coleco Chameleon was punishment
921760	923760	Not the Coleco vision
923760	925760	That's called a scam, I'm sorry
925760	927760	Close, but not quite
927760	930760	SSU100Matt in chat at live.vognetware.com says
930760	934760	Forget going to your room without dessert, play Virtual Boy
934760	936760	Do you want your kid to develop chronic migraines?
936760	938760	Cause the Virtual Boy, that's how you're gonna do it
938760	940760	That is how you're gonna do it
940760	943760	You know it's quite fast, like I watched the Ben Heck tear down of the Virtual Boy
943760	945760	He actually made it better too
945760	948760	But like just learning how that worked, how the whole Virtual Boy thing worked
948760	951760	Was like a spinning mirror and they had just like lights
951760	954760	It literally was like one set of lights blinking on and off
954760	957760	And it just spinning to cover the whole screen
957760	959760	Oh, I always thought it was just one big screen
959760	963760	No, no, it's like lights bouncing off mirrors and shit
963760	965760	It's like, it's crazy
965760	968760	God, no wonder it gave people headaches, that sounds cheap
968760	971760	Alright, anyhow, let's get into tonight's kickoff topic
971760	974760	I wanna talk about a couple things here at the top of the show
974760	976760	Before we get into the rest of the gaming news
976760	978760	But the big thing this week
978760	981760	You know, OLR, we've been around 15 years
981760	983760	When the show first started
983760	986760	We were gaming on mostly the PlayStation 2
986760	989760	And I think the Xbox had just come out
989760	993760	I think we were finally getting Xboxes to play
993760	996760	Dance Dance Revolution Ultra Mix on Xbox
996760	998760	Like that was like back when the show started
998760	1001760	When did Ultra Mix come out? Was that like, that wasn't too early in the Xbox
1001760	1004760	It wasn't too early, I remember when it came out
1004760	1007760	Because we had that guy that we used to play DDR with
1007760	1009760	Bring the Xbox over during OLR
1009760	1013760	That was when you and I lived together at the apartment we had with the pink carpet
1013760	1017760	Where we had the old webcam that would refresh every 30 seconds
1017760	1020760	That was when we played Ultra Mix for the first time
1020760	1022760	That was about the third year of the show probably
1022760	1024760	So maybe like 2003, 2004
1024760	1027760	So yeah, that was when that was out, Ultra Mix
1027760	1030760	But when the show first started it was mainly PlayStation 2
1030760	1035760	My point is, so we were here when PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 launched
1035760	1038760	We were here on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One launched
1038760	1042760	And this week, something that doesn't happen all the time is happening
1042760	1044760	We have a new console coming out
1044760	1048760	The Nintendo Switch is finally going to be out this Friday
1048760	1054760	So we will be living in a world where Nintendo NX is no longer something we speculate about
1054760	1057760	Over and over again because Nintendo won't say a goddamn thing about it
1057760	1060760	But we finally will be playing the Switch
1060760	1064760	And now that the press is getting their hands on the Switch
1064760	1066760	And more and more people are coming across
1066760	1069760	Nintendo Switch is out at expo events
1069760	1072760	I know Nintendo is in San Francisco with their tour
1072760	1078760	Which, with all respect, I didn't see the point of going to the San Francisco thing when it's out in like six days
1078760	1081760	I'm like, I'll have it in my living room in six days
1081760	1083760	So Nintendo Switch is going to be out
1083760	1087760	And we're finally learning the last few things about the console
1087760	1089760	Some of our questions getting answered
1089760	1092760	One of the big whoppers that they dropped on us this week
1092760	1094760	Virtual console ain't going to be there
1094760	1096760	No shit, you don't say
1096760	1100760	Well, now, again, not to inflate my ego too much
1100760	1102760	I need to be able to fit through the door
1102760	1104760	But did I not say on last week's show
1104760	1106760	We need to be prepared, it's not coming
1106760	1108760	Because they're not talking about it, it's not going to be here
1108760	1110760	Did I not say that like on last week's show
1110760	1114760	So, it doesn't mean I wasn't still disappointed in the news
1114760	1116760	And I gotta say
1116760	1118760	I really had to kind of like
1119760	1121760	I don't want to say argue about this
1121760	1123760	Because arguing over video games is sometimes silly
1123760	1125760	But I've had to have debates with this
1125760	1127760	Where I know so many people
1127760	1130760	That are huge Nintendo fans
1130760	1132760	Where it's like
1132760	1134760	If you criticize Nintendo
1134760	1136760	It's like you attack their religion or something
1136760	1138760	And it's like, okay, look
1138760	1140760	I can love video games, I do love video games
1140760	1142760	And I can love Nintendo, I do love Nintendo
1142760	1144760	I can still be critical of Nintendo
1144760	1146760	Question the things you love
1146760	1148760	Exactly, you can still sit here and go
1148760	1150760	This is something that should be better
1150760	1152760	And I do it with all the systems
1152760	1154760	Sony is not perfect
1154760	1156760	Microsoft is not perfect
1156760	1158760	Yes, she doesn't have an Xbox One
1158760	1160760	You know, Microsoft
1160760	1162760	And there's things I love about Microsoft
1162760	1164760	I think the Windows 10 integration is awesome
1164760	1166760	Personally, but anyway
1166760	1168760	I think Windows 10 is poop
1168760	1170760	It is awesome because now I don't have to buy an Xbox One
1170760	1172760	This isn't about Microsoft
1172760	1174760	Look, this is about Nintendo
1174760	1176760	And I think even though I can say I love Nintendo
1176760	1178760	I do feel like I get disappointed
1178760	1180760	By Nintendo a lot
1180760	1182760	Because you feel like there's these things that are like
1182760	1184760	The low hanging fruit
1184760	1186760	That's what they call it in the corporate world
1186760	1188760	The low hanging fruit that you think Nintendo could go for
1188760	1190760	And they don't
1190760	1192760	And this has been a battle for forever
1192760	1194760	It's been the whole online gaming thing
1194760	1196760	It's been like a low hanging fruit for Nintendo
1196760	1198760	That they never seem to get
1198760	1200760	That maybe they're going to get right with the Switch
1200760	1202760	Now they're going to charge money for it
1202760	1204760	But we don't know because Nintendo's really
1204760	1206760	Still not answering a lot of those questions
1206760	1208760	Although
1208760	1210760	What? Are we going to find out on Friday?
1210760	1212760	I guess we're going to have to with the online stuff
1212760	1214760	Right? Because Bomberman and all that stuff is supposed to be playable online
1214760	1216760	So we'll start to get some of those answers finally by Friday
1216760	1218760	But anyway
1218760	1220760	Virtual Console ain't going to be there day one
1220760	1222760	And I have to admit I'm a little bit disappointed
1222760	1224760	And you know
1224760	1226760	Some folks are trying to needle me on Twitter a little bit
1226760	1228760	Saying, oh Rob
1228760	1230760	Do you really have to play Balloon Fight on a
1230760	1232760	30 year old game on a brand new Nintendo console
1232760	1234760	And it's like
1234760	1236760	Well, yes
1236760	1238760	Actually
1238760	1240760	Because something that the Switch can do
1240760	1242760	That the other systems that
1242760	1244760	Virtual Console isn't available on
1244760	1246760	Is the whole fact that I could be playing
1246760	1248760	Something on my TV and then
1248760	1250760	Pick up my Switch and go somewhere else with it
1250760	1252760	And I was looking forward to being able to do that with
1252760	1254760	Yes, the old games too
1254760	1256760	Or the whole fact that
1256760	1258760	Perhaps if we're playing a two player game
1258760	1260760	Like the original Mario Brothers
1260760	1262760	Not Super Mario Brothers, the original Mario Brothers
1262760	1264760	Maybe I could have a Switch
1264760	1266760	And my friend who's over has a Switch
1266760	1268760	And we can play old school console
1268760	1270760	Games like that, you know
1270760	1272760	Like in the same room and be having fun with that
1272760	1274760	Right? So, yeah
1274760	1276760	I am a little disappointed that's not going to be there day one
1276760	1278760	I understand that Virtual Console will probably
1278760	1280760	Happen eventually
1280760	1282760	But it's another one of those things
1282760	1284760	Where I'm like, this launch
1284760	1286760	Is starting to feel more and more
1286760	1288760	Half-assed
1288760	1290760	And then I had one of my friends
1290760	1292760	Telling me about how, well when you look
1292760	1294760	At the other console launches
1294760	1296760	You know, how can you say that Nintendo is half-assed
1296760	1298760	Because PlayStation 4 had
1298760	1300760	All these ports when it came out and dah dah dah
1300760	1302760	And all this other stuff
1302760	1304760	Here's the thing
1304760	1306760	I was thinking about that
1306760	1308760	And this is one of the other key differences
1308760	1310760	The reason why I'm really feeling
1310760	1312760	This a lot is of how
1312760	1314760	Shady
1314760	1316760	Nintendo is being with the information
1316760	1318760	At least with PlayStation 4
1318760	1320760	At least with Xbox
1320760	1322760	And these other systems
1322760	1324760	We pretty much knew months in advance
1324760	1326760	Exactly what was going to come out of that box
1326760	1328760	We learned the answer about Virtual Console
1328760	1330760	This week
1330760	1332760	We still don't know the answers about online
1332760	1334760	And this is out in five days
1334760	1336760	Right? That's the shit that is starting
1336760	1338760	To make this really feel like
1338760	1340760	We're pulling it out of our asses as we go
1340760	1342760	We don't have any sort of like
1342760	1344760	And even the PlayStation 3 or even
1344760	1346760	Xbox 360, Xbox One
1346760	1348760	There was no question of how online
1348760	1350760	Was going to work for those systems
1350760	1352760	Or even that most of the feature sets
1352760	1354760	Advertised for it are going to be there at launch
1354760	1356760	Not, oh hey
1356760	1358760	Patch it in later
1358760	1360760	Dartitsuyu in chat says
1360760	1362760	But to be fair, is Virtual Console really
1362760	1364760	A huge deal? In the meantime, they're going to get
1364760	1366760	Arcade Archives, so if you need your retro fix
1366760	1368760	That would be the way to go
1368760	1370760	Arcade Archives is cool, but have they said
1370760	1372760	Witch games in the archives, there's
1372760	1374760	Kind of a lot of garbage in the Arcade Archives
1374760	1376760	There's some good stuff, there's some good Neo Geo
1376760	1378760	Fighters and like Bubble Bobble
1378760	1380760	Isn't that just Virtual Console anyways?
1380760	1382760	It's Sony's thing, it's like arcade emulation
1382760	1384760	Basically, and yeah, it's
1384760	1386760	It is kind of just Virtual Console, so it is weird
1386760	1388760	To me that it's, the Arcade Archives
1388760	1390760	Thing is getting a whole spinoff, but
1390760	1392760	Whatever, it doesn't make sense
1392760	1394760	It's probably because
1394760	1396760	Their networking shit ain't worked out
1396760	1398760	Because if you think about it
1398760	1400760	That isn't
1400760	1402760	I mean, I guess it does make sense that Virtual Console
1402760	1404760	Is not there, because they're saying that Virtual Console now
1404760	1406760	Is going to support net play over
1406760	1408760	You know, over the internet
1408760	1410760	As you're going to be able to do multiplayer
1410760	1412760	So because they don't have their net code shit figured out
1412760	1414760	That's why you don't have the networking
1414760	1416760	The online networking right now, or multiplayer
1416760	1418760	For the most part
1418760	1420760	I mean, at least that paid service
1420760	1422760	And maybe that's why Virtual Console's not out
1422760	1424760	Whereas these arcade games don't have
1424760	1426760	That, or at least I assume they don't have
1426760	1428760	That internet play
1428760	1430760	And so that's why they're able to just dump them on there
1430760	1432760	So anyway, um
1432760	1434760	Let's see, what's the other thing here
1434760	1436760	Sj100matt in chat says
1436760	1438760	I would like a Virtual Console lineup to supplement the inevitable
1438760	1440760	Dead period between games on the Switch
1440760	1442760	Yeah, that's true too
1442760	1444760	And to be fair, maybe there was a part of me
1444760	1446760	That was hoping that Nintendo was
1446760	1448760	Going to do it differently this time
1448760	1450760	With Virtual Console, I know, hahaha
1450760	1452760	But that they would actually have a
1452760	1454760	Constant flow of Virtual Console
1454760	1456760	Releases, which if you look at the Wii U
1456760	1458760	In the past couple years, it has not been a constant flow
1458760	1460760	But, you know, God
1460760	1462760	There's this story floating around the internet
1462760	1464760	About a guy who just beat
1464760	1466760	714 Nintendo
1466760	1468760	Games on his Twitch stream, right?
1468760	1470760	There's a big story going around about that this week, right?
1470760	1472760	So there's over
1472760	1474760	700 Nintendo games
1474760	1476760	That they could put on Virtual Console
1476760	1478760	You put one game a week
1478760	1480760	And that's just Nintendo
1480760	1482760	You put one game a week
1482760	1484760	And that would carry that system for over
1484760	1486760	10 years
1486760	1488760	Like with new stuff
1488760	1490760	Ok, I understand, some of those games are garbage
1490760	1492760	Licensing issues
1492760	1494760	Blah de blah de blah, fine
1494760	1496760	Get like 200 of the 700 games
1496760	1498760	Less than a third
1498760	1500760	Get 200 of them
1500760	1502760	That's still going to be like one new game a week
1502760	1504760	For almost 4 years
1504760	1506760	And that's just Nintendo
1506760	1508760	That's not even counting
1508760	1510760	Super Nintendo, Genesis, Turbo Graphics
1510760	1512760	Commodore 64 they could bring back
1512760	1514760	Because that's the soft spot in my heart
1514760	1516760	They did like 4 Commodore 64 games on the Wii
1516760	1518760	And then that was it
1518760	1520760	Yeah, I guess I'm just a little bummed
1520760	1522760	I was just hoping
1522760	1524760	Maybe Virtual Console would be a little better
1524760	1526760	This time
1526760	1528760	Doesn't sound like it's going to be
1528760	1530760	So it's a little bit disappointing in my opinion
1530760	1532760	But
1532760	1534760	I will give Nintendo this credit
1534760	1536760	Because, oh my gosh, I can be critical
1536760	1538760	And I can say good things too
1538760	1540760	And I am very excited to hear
1540760	1542760	That it sounds like more games are actually
1542760	1544760	Making the launch day, right?
1544760	1546760	Yeah, more games are making the launch day
1546760	1548760	And also with that
1548760	1550760	They're physical games, you know
1550760	1552760	If you're like, of course, buying digitally
1552760	1554760	You're going to have to install everything
1554760	1556760	But they're physical games, unlike the PlayStation 4
1556760	1558760	And Xbox One
1558760	1560760	Do not require an install on top of
1560760	1562760	The game
1562760	1564760	It's just going to be whatever's on that
1564760	1566760	That cartridge
1566760	1568760	That's going to be cool
1568760	1570760	At least right now
1570760	1572760	Can't promise that for the future
1572760	1574760	Yeah, that's still cool
1574760	1576760	That more games are going to make the actual launch day
1576760	1578760	I know I'm very excited for Fast Racing
1578760	1580760	Neo Remix
1580760	1582760	Thought that was a very competent game on the Wii U
1582760	1584760	So I'm excited to see what they do with that
1584760	1586760	With the Switch
1586760	1588760	Now that's another game I will have to get on March 3
1588760	1590760	Because right now, as it was
1590760	1592760	I was really only going to get Zelda
1592760	1594760	I'm not really interested in the Bomberman
1594760	1596760	Thing, which I've talked about before
1596760	1598760	Maybe when I see it in action, I'll change my mind
1598760	1600760	But I'm not willing to
1600760	1602760	Take the leap of faith on Bomberman
1602760	1604760	The way I'm willing to do with Zelda
1604760	1606760	But I know Fast Racing Neo, I'm willing to take the leap of faith with that
1606760	1608760	So I'm excited to get that
1608760	1610760	And what, Snipperclips
1610760	1612760	Or whatever they're calling that, that's out
1612760	1614760	On March 3rd as well
1614760	1616760	Nippleclamps, that's out on March 3rd as well
1616760	1618760	You can use your Joy-Con
1618760	1620760	And explore fun new ways with your friends
1620760	1622760	To titillate
1622760	1624760	With HD vibrations
1624760	1626760	But yeah, Snipperclips
1626760	1628760	I'm sure will be fun
1628760	1630760	And that might be a good in the same room type of game too
1630760	1632760	So I mean, yes, there's positive things as well
1632760	1634760	I like that
1634760	1636760	Okay, now Nintendo's coming out swinging out the door
1636760	1638760	With more than just Zelda
1638760	1640760	Even though, you know, of course, Zelda's a big freaking deal
1640760	1642760	But that'll be nice
1642760	1644760	So, I'm still getting my Switch
1644760	1646760	I can huff and puff about Virtual Console
1646760	1648760	I think I'm just
1648760	1650760	Accepting that
1650760	1652760	The Switch for right now
1652760	1654760	Is going to be a Zelda machine
1654760	1656760	For the first couple months
1656760	1658760	And Nintendo should really be thanking BioWare
1658760	1660760	For going to be distracting me
1660760	1662760	With Mass Effect Andromeda
1662760	1664760	In these first few months
1664760	1666760	Right after, you know, I get some good hands on time with Zelda
1666760	1668760	And then by the time I'm done with Mass Effect Andromeda
1668760	1670760	Oh, here comes Mario Kart
1670760	1672760	Splatoon 2
1672760	1674760	And everything else that, you know, we have to look forward to
1674760	1676760	Do you have all your amiibo pre-ordered?
1676760	1678760	Because you gotta get all the amiibo stuff
1678760	1680760	Nintendo seems to think so
1680760	1682760	So, yeah
1682760	1684760	So, I mean, at least
1684760	1686760	There's that and, you know, by the summer
1686760	1688760	We get Splatoon 2, which is a big deal
1688760	1690760	Arms, I'm hearing a lot of
1690760	1692760	Positive stuff on, I'm still skeptical
1692760	1694760	But I'm willing to say, okay, well
1694760	1696760	Let me get it in my arms and play with it
1696760	1698760	And maybe I'll be sold on it
1698760	1700760	I'm excited to check it out
1700760	1702760	And then Holiday will be
1702760	1704760	The Mario game, I know, Loki
1704760	1706760	You like to joke that it'll get delayed
1706760	1708760	I think we all know Nintendo can't afford to delay that
1708760	1710760	They'll have that on Holiday
1710760	1712760	Or they'll have some big fucking title for Holiday
1712760	1714760	They have to, because the real launch
1714760	1716760	Of the Switch is Holiday
1716760	1718760	I fully expect Virtual Consoles in place
1718760	1720760	Probably in October
1720760	1722760	Star Fox Zero, again
1722760	1724760	No, they're not that bold
1724760	1726760	I hope not, anyway
1726760	1728760	Let's see, JD is in our chat over at
1728760	1730760	Live.vognetwork.com saying
1730760	1732760	A couple people I know who went to the demo
1732760	1734760	The San Francisco thing this weekend
1734760	1736760	I wasn't sold on Arms until I
1736760	1738760	Played it. William
1738760	1740760	Murderface points out Stormblood
1740760	1742760	Will be a nice time sink as well, that's right
1742760	1744760	Final Fantasy XIV gets an expansion
1744760	1746760	Nintendo can thank Square Enix as well
1746760	1748760	For that, so there'll be things to distract
1748760	1750760	Me from, you know, okay
1750760	1752760	I'm done with Zelda on the Switch, now what?
1752760	1754760	So, alright
1754760	1756760	Anyway, what else on the Switch?
1756760	1758760	Anything else we need to talk about with the Switch before
1758760	1760760	We move on into gaming weeks and
1760760	1762760	What else is going on? Just most of the downloads are
1762760	1764760	Pretty reasonably sized, it looks like anything that's
1764760	1766760	More of just like a digital only titles
1766760	1768760	Is they're gonna be about 1 gig
1768760	1770760	Ish, whereas
1770760	1772760	You know, comparable
1772760	1774760	Download sizes to the Wii U
1774760	1776760	Cause I was looking at, they had Mario Kart 8 listed
1776760	1778760	On there, and it's about the same size as
1778760	1780760	On the Wii U, which makes sense cause
1780760	1782760	The visuals are pretty much the same
1782760	1784760	And then, you know, Zelda of course
1784760	1786760	Being the biggest one, like 13.6
1786760	1788760	Gigs or something
1788760	1790760	Which is like half your storage right there
1791760	1793760	Yeah, because even though they say 32 gigs
1793760	1795760	The operating system
1795760	1797760	Takes up so much of it, and there's gonna be a
1797760	1799760	Day one patch by the way, so
1799760	1801760	Expect that more of it will get eaten up
1801760	1803760	Just don't buy digitally, at least on this system
1803760	1805760	Cause it doesn't really make sense as far as
1805760	1807760	Being able to store it on there right now
1807760	1809760	And because Nintendo's so good
1809760	1811760	At not dropping prices of their games
1811760	1813760	So that means your game's gonna be worthwhile
1813760	1815760	Later on, and once you've finally played out
1815760	1817760	Zelda to your heart's content
1817760	1819760	Then you can always sell it back later on
1820760	1822760	Like Fast Racing Neo, is that getting a physical release?
1822760	1824760	No, that's not, but like I'm talking about the ones you do have a choice
1824760	1826760	You know, just buy it at retail
1826760	1828760	Is I Am Setsuna still a March 3rd game?
1828760	1830760	I think so
1830760	1832760	I haven't checked that out on the other platforms yet
1832760	1834760	So I was thinking about maybe getting that one too on the Switch
1834760	1837760	Just to buff up the library a little bit
1837760	1839760	So, yeah, okay
1839760	1842760	Well, I'm gonna definitely pick up a Switch on Friday
1842760	1845760	And I can't wait to talk all about it on the next edition of the show
1845760	1847760	I'm hoping over the weekend, at some point
1847760	1849760	I can connect with some other people that own a Switch
1849760	1852760	And we can test out some of the multiplayer stuff
1852760	1855760	And, you know, get a feel for it
1855760	1857760	You know, I'm still excited, despite these things
1857760	1860760	Where I'm like, I have to constantly lower expectations sometimes
1860760	1862760	I am still excited
1862760	1864760	I'm excited because everything I'm hearing
1864760	1867760	About the whole fact that, you know, you play on the TV
1867760	1869760	And then you pick it up and take it with you
1869760	1871760	It's super seamless, it's fast
1871760	1874760	It works the way you think it would based on the previews
1874760	1876760	I think a lot of that sounds really exciting
1876760	1880760	It sounds like, if nothing else, as a tech nerd
1880760	1882760	The technology's gonna be awesome
1882760	1885760	Even if sometimes I wish Nintendo would do a little more with the technology
1885760	1886760	That's all it is
1886760	1889760	So, yeah, and DungeonBuster in chat over at live.vognetwork.com
1889760	1891760	Says, it's been getting good reviews so far
1891760	1894760	And ActDeft confirming, iAmSatsuna is March 3rd, yeah
1894760	1898760	JD pointing out, aren't SD cards cheap and easy to upgrade on consoles?
1898760	1899760	Yeah, there is that
1899760	1901760	So, I mean, even though Loki's saying, don't go digital
1901760	1904760	I still understand, I understand what you're saying when it comes to like that
1904760	1906760	But does it have expanded storage on that console?
1906760	1909760	Oh, yeah, you can pop in another SD card, that's it
1909760	1912760	Are they gonna allow you to save to it?
1912760	1914760	Yes, yes, no, that's not a problem
1914760	1919760	They are making that a lot easier than it was on their other systems
1919760	1922760	So that part's, well, even on the Wii, it really wasn't that bad
1922760	1925760	But I think it's even gonna be a little better on the Switch
1925760	1927760	I'm not worried about that end of it at all
1927760	1930760	But I think you do raise a damn good point
1930760	1936760	When, and I've always said this, you know, what's the benefit in me buying digital, right?
1936760	1940760	Because you said Nintendo doesn't drop the price on their games for a long time
1940760	1941760	So you have more
1941760	1942760	Or at all, I mean
1942760	1944760	You have more equity basically in those cartridges
1944760	1946760	Those cartridges are still worth something
1946760	1948760	So if you do get sick of the game, you can sell it back
1948760	1950760	And you make some money back
1950760	1952760	Whereas with digital games, you don't ever get to do that
1952760	1955760	Yeah, like, I mean, I'm not saying that Zelda isn't necessarily a great example
1955760	1958760	Because Zelda's gonna be probably, I mean, that Zelda
1958760	1961760	I think it's gonna be one that's gonna have a lot of replayability on it
1961760	1963760	But like something like ARMS or something
1963760	1965760	Where you may buy it and it may be fun for a while
1965760	1968760	And it's just like, okay, listen, I'm just not really interested in playing this anymore
1968760	1972760	That might be something that's worth picking up physically and doing that
1972760	1975760	I mean, I'm definitely looking forward to picking up Zelda
1975760	1977760	Just to be picking it up on the Wii U
1977760	1981760	I haven't pre-ordered it, so I'll try to go pick it up day one
1981760	1985760	And if they say, oh, it's not available, like, well, fine, I'll just download it
1985760	1988760	I'm not pre-ordering your shit fucking GameStop
1988760	1992760	Let's see, a couple of people in chat talking about the whole memory card thing
1992760	1997760	And a couple of people saying it looks like two terabytes may be the cap on the memory cards
1997760	1999760	And what the Switch supports, but, okay, two terabytes
1999760	2002760	Let's not get ahead of ourselves, I mean, there's not that many games coming out for you
2002760	2004760	I mean, shit
2004760	2006760	You could probably fit
2006760	2007760	That's a little much
2007760	2010760	You could probably fit everything that Nintendo's gonna release this year on that kind of card
2010760	2012760	Or in the lifetime of the system
2012760	2014760	But that is low-key
2014760	2019760	That is good, though, that, you know, yes, it will go that high if people do want to do the digital thing
2019760	2021760	Because there are people that disagree
2021760	2024760	And they think that the digital thing is much more of a convenience
2024760	2026760	Especially those that are gonna be more portable with the system
2026760	2027760	Fine, more power to you
2027760	2032760	They are really missing out, though, not having YouTube or Netflix or anything on that thing
2032760	2035760	I'm serious, like, that's what my son uses before we got his tablet
2035760	2036760	That's the way he would use it
2036760	2039760	And he still uses the Wii U for that, is watching YouTube
2039760	2045760	And I think Netflix on the TV to the portable instantly is a real missed opportunity
2045760	2049760	We talked about that in a previous episode, I'm not gonna re-hide that
2049760	2052760	But, you know what, maybe it'll be there by holiday
2052760	2056760	I think we need to go back and re-evaluate, I think it'll be interesting
2056760	2061760	I almost feel like I wanna, like, write down every- maybe we'll do this on the next episode of OLR
2061760	2063760	Tell me if you guys think this is a good idea
2063760	2068760	On the next episode of OLR, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna write down the list of my grievances
2068760	2071760	And things I wish they would do better on the Switch
2071760	2075760	I'm gonna write it down, and we're gonna put it in an envelope and leave it here in the studio
2075760	2083760	And during the Christmas episode of OLR, we're gonna open it and see what problems Nintendo addressed during the year to make the console a full-fledged system
2083760	2085760	Shortest time capsule ever
2085760	2087760	Yeah, shortest time capsule ever
2087760	2088760	I like that, that's the segment
2088760	2091760	Short attention span time capsule
2091760	2093760	We should just do one of those every year
2093760	2095760	I think it's a good idea, short attention span time
2095760	2101760	Well, shit, episodes of this show are kind of- we could just always go back and listen to an old episode of OLR
2101760	2104760	But that would involve us having to listen to ourselves
2104760	2105760	I don't wanna do that
2105760	2107760	No, not gonna do that
2107760	2109760	I certainly don't wanna listen to myself the way I sound right now
2111760	2113760	I don't even wanna talk the way I sound right now
2113760	2115760	Alright, done
2115760	2116760	JD in a sock
2116760	2119760	Yes, JD in chat says a mini time capsule is a great idea
2119760	2122760	Come on, Noel Gus in chat says put your list in a sock
2122760	2123760	And you know what?
2123760	2125760	I love it, we're gonna put it in a sock
2125760	2129760	No, you know, we need a time capsule, you know what that means?
2129760	2132760	We need to get one of those little containers of the mini Tootsie Rolls
2132760	2134760	That's actually also doubles as a piggy bank
2134760	2135760	I gave you one
2135760	2136760	And there you go
2136760	2137760	So vanilla ones
2137760	2139760	I wasn't thinking of the short attention span time capsule
2139760	2142760	And then on top of that, we get mini Tootsie Rolls
2142760	2144760	I support this play, okay
2144760	2149760	And we'll leave one in the time capsule as a present to ourselves
2149760	2153760	You know what? I should like put in like a clipping of my hair to see if my hair color is like
2153760	2154760	Is that gonna be like a
2154760	2156760	Pused by the end of the year or something
2156760	2157760	Okay, I love it
2157760	2161760	We're creating a scene in the Christmas story where we're like we're cutting it into three pieces, you know
2161760	2162760	This mini Tootsie
2162760	2164760	Alright, this is happening on the next OLR
2164760	2168760	Short attention span time capsule 2017 edition Nintendo Switch
2168760	2170760	I actually think I still have one of those containers somewhere
2170760	2173760	Alright, then bring it to the show and that can be our time capsule
2173760	2174760	Let's go buy another one
2174760	2176760	If not, then I'll just go to the dollar store
2176760	2178760	I will find a sock
2178760	2179760	Get a plastic bin
2179760	2181760	We'll paint it silver
2181760	2184760	Okay, it has to fit here in the studio somewhere
2184760	2185760	We have to
2187760	2188760	Alright, I love it
2188760	2190760	Come on, Noel Gush suggests
2190760	2193760	Go to the 99 cent only store and put a Lego dimensions figure in it as well
2193760	2196760	Dude, yeah, like I want to run across those
2196760	2200760	Like my son got one as like a Valentine's Day card or whatever
2200760	2202760	And of course he's like, I don't want this
2202760	2204760	And it was the Simpsons car
2204760	2206760	I was like, sweet, where do I get more of these?
2206760	2208760	I like building Legos
2209760	2211760	Like more than any person probably should
2211760	2213760	But I like it
2213760	2216760	Alright, anything else on the Switch we need to talk about before Friday?
2216760	2217760	No
2217760	2219760	Alright, there it is
2219760	2221760	So, Darsakha, will you at least
2221760	2223760	Will you try playing with my Switch before we
2223760	2225760	Shove things in a sock?
2229760	2232760	I'm going to pretend that you didn't phrase it exactly that way
2232760	2233760	Alright
2233760	2234760	I would entertain
2234760	2235760	Phrasing
2235760	2237760	I would entertain the possibility
2237760	2240760	Of a demo of the Nintendo Switch
2240760	2242760	That you just happen to own
2242760	2244760	Socks not included
2244760	2246760	Okay, fair enough
2248760	2250760	JD in chat simply says, whoa
2250760	2252760	Phrasing
2252760	2254760	That's Emmison Mansey
2254760	2256760	You know what, that's going to be our quote
2256760	2259760	Our word of the year, like Tatiana's choices
2259760	2260760	Phrasing
2260760	2261760	Phrasing
2261760	2263760	That Archer episode was like four years ago
2263760	2265760	So I kind of think
2265760	2267760	That's like every Archer episode
2267760	2269760	I've only watched like one season of Archer
2269760	2271760	Okay, first off
2271760	2273760	And What's Your Face was pregnant most of it
2273760	2275760	First off, Archer is fucking amazing
2275760	2277760	Like it's got some of the greatest quotes in it
2277760	2279760	Like I just said, Emmison Mansey
2279760	2281760	Do you like ants?
2281760	2283760	Do you want ants? Because that's how you get ants
2283760	2285760	Why not that?
2285760	2287760	Lots of great
2287760	2289760	Archer quotes, anyway
2289760	2293760	Let's move on
2293760	2295760	I was ready to move on
2295760	2297760	Let's move on to our
2297760	2299760	Too many socks
2299760	2301760	Alright, that's in the 2015 capsule
2301760	2303760	Oh god
2303760	2305760	How was your gaming week?
2305760	2307760	What types of video games have you been playing this week?
2307760	2309760	And what socks have you been wearing?
2309760	2311760	Dark Sakura
2311760	2313760	I have these very cushy socks that I got at Daiso
2313760	2315760	In Roseville
2315760	2317760	They're $1.25 a piece
2317760	2319760	And their pile, they're very comfortable
2319760	2321760	They're my new favorite pair of socks
2321760	2323760	For $1.25?
2323760	2325760	Yeah, seriously, fucking Daiso
2325760	2327760	I know what a Daiso is
2327760	2329760	Cat socks at Daiso, worth every penny
2329760	2331760	One of those vacuums?
2331760	2333760	That's Dyson
2333760	2335760	It's like a Japanese Dollar Tree
2335760	2337760	It's like the Dollar Tree that everything in there is like
2337760	2339760	In Japan it's like a Yen store
2339760	2341760	Where's this? The Galleria
2341760	2343760	They have one at the Galleria and they're putting one in South Sac
2343760	2345760	Which is going to be like
2345760	2347760	Daiso, yeah
2347760	2349760	Oh my god, I'm going to be so happy
2349760	2351760	I fucking love Daiso
2351760	2353760	Anyway, so now that the socks are out of the way
2353760	2355760	Let's go ahead and get on to my
2355760	2357760	game I've been playing
2357760	2359760	Game singular, because fuck
2359760	2361760	AkumaJP is pointing out it's a 100 Yen shop
2361760	2363760	That's what I corrected myself
2363760	2365760	Okay, I was going to say 1 Yen is actually not a lot of money
2365760	2367760	No, I corrected myself
2367760	2369760	It's like the Peso store
2369760	2371760	Did everyone not hear when I corrected myself?
2371760	2373760	No, we were laughing too hard at the sock thing
2373760	2375760	Girl, okay
2375760	2377760	Video games!
2377760	2379760	But also my Daiso socks are amazing
2379760	2381760	Anyway, so I've just been playing World of Warcraft
2381760	2383760	Like, a lot
2383760	2385760	Dan's probably
2385760	2387760	Addict
2387760	2389760	You know what, yeah, kinda
2389760	2391760	How does it feel all these years later?
2391760	2393760	Well, I really, though, I like this whole
2393760	2395760	expansion because
2395760	2397760	I am an Illidan fangirl
2397760	2399760	And it's just been
2399760	2401760	Demon Hunties all over the place
2401760	2403760	Addict
2403760	2405760	You should still play with me in VRT
2405760	2407760	Because it's fun
2407760	2409760	Are the gameboy.org guys ever on there?
2409760	2411760	John was on once
2411760	2413760	To give me
2413760	2415760	Guild adding privileges
2415760	2417760	Oh, cool
2417760	2419760	And then, I actually
2419760	2421760	I had bad
2421760	2423760	insomnia one night and played Bust a Move
2423760	2425760	on my phone, as in Puzzle Bobble
2425760	2427760	And
2427760	2429760	I don't know what the hell I did
2429760	2431760	I was on some fucking streak
2431760	2433760	And my highest
2433760	2435760	score had been like 500,000
2435760	2437760	for a while
2437760	2439760	I hit 1,500,000
2439760	2441760	And I don't even know what I did
2441760	2443760	So, lots of Bust a Move
2443760	2445760	And then
2445760	2447760	Pokemon Go, because all the new Pokemans
2447760	2449760	are out and they're adorable
2449760	2451760	Except for this one thing
2451760	2453760	That I wasn't even thinking of Magma being part of its name
2453760	2455760	And you know how I feel about
2455760	2457760	Snails and Slugs, I hate them
2457760	2459760	And it was called
2459760	2461760	It's Slugma
2461760	2463760	Slugma, right
2463760	2465760	I didn't for a moment think about Magma
2465760	2467760	Do not go to the nastiest place possible on this show
2467760	2469760	I did go to the nastiest place possible
2469760	2471760	That's all you need to say
2471760	2473760	Until someone pointed out that
2473760	2475760	No, that's fire and it's magma
2475760	2477760	And not the favorite curse from Red Dwarf
2477760	2479760	So
2479760	2481760	Yeah
2481760	2483760	I caught one and I don't care anymore
2483760	2485760	So
2485760	2487760	Um
2487760	2489760	I have a Furret now
2489760	2491760	And it's adorable
2491760	2493760	The Furrets are cute, considering they're the new Pidgeys
2493760	2495760	And those things, the Centrets or whatever
2495760	2497760	Are fucking everywhere
2497760	2499760	And now I have all these Furrets
2499760	2501760	The Furrets are adorable
2501760	2503760	I just want to take a nap in a pile of Furrets
2503760	2505760	You do want a Furret coat for Christmas?
2505760	2507760	No!
2507760	2509760	I want them to be alive and scribble
2509760	2511760	I want them to be pets for reals
2511760	2513760	But that's really been
2513760	2515760	Oh yeah, Miitomo
2515760	2517760	I'm still doing Miitomo
2517760	2519760	I do realize though, some of the Gen 2 Pokemon
2519760	2521760	Get really uncreative
2521760	2523760	Like, there's a Pokemon called
2523760	2525760	Pineco
2525760	2527760	Do you know what it is?
2527760	2529760	It's a fucking pinecone
2529760	2531760	And his name is Pineco
2531760	2533760	That I think is the prettiest one right now
2533760	2535760	Is the Xatu
2535760	2537760	Oh yeah, the evolved
2537760	2539760	I caught one on its own
2539760	2541760	But they're pretty
2541760	2543760	Like, Mayan and Incan
2543760	2545760	Design
2545760	2547760	And I really like the design
2547760	2549760	Some of the designs are really cool
2549760	2551760	My watch told me to stand, so I'm standing
2551760	2553760	Alright, you stand
2553760	2555760	Catch a Pokemon with your watch
2555760	2557760	I have been doing Pokemon Go with my Apple Watch
2557760	2559760	And I have to talk about that a little bit
2559760	2561760	Sure, go for it
2561760	2563760	If you can't bust out your phone
2563760	2565760	But you're going to go for a walk
2565760	2567760	I don't know how this works on the Series 2
2567760	2569760	It has the built-in GPS and everything
2569760	2571760	But I find it really neat
2571760	2573760	That when I'm doing my walk at work
2573760	2575760	I just turn it on on my watch
2575760	2577760	And it actually even has
2577760	2579760	Kind of like how your little thing blinks
2579760	2581760	You know, when there's Pokemon nearby
2581760	2583760	It'll actually show me the list of them
2583760	2585760	And let me pick which ones I want to catch
2585760	2587760	It lets me hit the Pokestop as I'm walking around
2587760	2589760	But the other thing too
2589760	2591760	Is that the feedback that it gives
2591760	2593760	For my walking for Pokemon
2593760	2595760	Goes into my
2595760	2597760	Workout ring
2597760	2599760	Or close the rings challenge
2599760	2601760	That's a big thing
2601760	2603760	All over the place
2603760	2605760	It applies to my
2605760	2607760	Workout ring on my watch
2607760	2609760	So
2609760	2611760	I love the integration
2611760	2613760	It's really fun
2613760	2615760	Is that like Fitbit? Because when I play Pokemon Go
2615760	2617760	I still get the credit on Fitbit
2617760	2621760	I honestly think it's more accurate than Fitbit
2621760	2625760	And I've read a lot of comparisons and things
2625760	2627760	And they always are updating it with every OS
2627760	2629760	I'm still on the iPhone 6 Plus
2629760	2631760	And the big thing they added into that
2631760	2633760	Was they put a Fitbit type thing in it
2633760	2635760	So I know I'm getting crazy
2635760	2637760	Same with the Success Plus
2637760	2639760	Or Success, what I have
2639760	2641760	But the watch will also monitor your heartbeat
2641760	2643760	And so as you're walking
2643760	2645760	It will put it into your whole
2645760	2647760	Workout thing
2647760	2649760	So every time your heart rate goes up
2649760	2651760	It counts as workout time
2651760	2653760	I have the weirdest question about the watch
2653760	2655760	Does it work if you own two iPhones?
2655760	2657760	Can it sync to both?
2657760	2659760	Or no, you have to pick one
2659760	2661760	You have to pick one, but you can do two watches
2661760	2663760	For a phone
2663760	2665760	But pairing, I mean, it takes like
2665760	2667760	A minute
2667760	2669760	It's only because
2669760	2671760	Basically your data is stored on your phone
2671760	2673760	And syncs to your watch
2673760	2675760	Because the watch doesn't have that big of a capacity
2675760	2677760	But I mean
2677760	2679760	And if you get a series too
2679760	2681760	Could you imagine swimming for your Pokemon walking?
2681760	2683760	That would be pretty rad
2683760	2685760	But yeah, I hadn't played a lot with it
2685760	2687760	Until this past week
2687760	2689760	And I was actually really
2689760	2691760	Delighted by how it worked
2691760	2693760	Very surprised, very delighted
2693760	2695760	It just really
2695760	2697760	Was uh
2697760	2699760	It made it a lot more fun for me
2699760	2701760	Because then I didn't have to stare at my
2701760	2703760	Phone while I was going walking
2703760	2705760	I could actually just leave it and go
2705760	2707760	And it was really fun
2707760	2709760	So it's like
2709760	2711760	Having your little device
2711760	2713760	What's it called?
2713760	2715760	Yeah, it's like having that
2715760	2717760	But more interactive
2717760	2719760	And then you get the little thumps on your wrist
2719760	2721760	When it finds stuff
2721760	2723760	So that's cool, the whole haptic feedback
2723760	2725760	So anyway, that's my mini review
2725760	2727760	Of Pokemon Go on the Apple Watch
2727760	2729760	Alright, there it is
2729760	2731760	Moving on, Loki, how was your gaming week?
2731760	2733760	I played lots of Skyrim
2733760	2735760	As usual
2735760	2737760	And then of course also played
2737760	2739760	Until Dawn Rush of Blood
2739760	2741760	Because I actually haven't played
2741760	2743760	Too much of that
2743760	2745760	I've been demonstrating it a lot for people
2745760	2747760	But I actually went and decided to play
2747760	2749760	Some of it myself
2749760	2751760	And that game is still a lot of fun
2751760	2753760	I really enjoy that game
2753760	2755760	But it's kind of funny though
2755760	2757760	Because everybody else that plays those games
2757760	2759760	The first time they're jumping and everything
2759760	2761760	And I'm just like fucking going to town
2761760	2763760	Killing shit with my guns
2763760	2765760	But I really do enjoy that game
2765760	2767760	And I've also been getting lots of peer pressure
2767760	2769760	To get Overwatch
2769760	2771760	So I don't know if I'm going to do that though
2771760	2773760	It's not really on sale too much right now
2773760	2775760	It's like 17% off
2775760	2777760	Or something like that on the
2777760	2779760	Playstation Store
2779760	2781760	But I don't know
2781760	2783760	People want me to play it
2783760	2785760	That's it
2785760	2787760	Oh well, Pokemon Go actually
2787760	2789760	I don't have the plus yet
2789760	2791760	But I've been playing a little bit of Pokemon Go
2791760	2793760	Mainly just enough to keep my
2793760	2795760	Streaks going each day
2795760	2797760	That's about it
2797760	2799760	Honestly I'll turn on every once in a while
2799760	2801760	Usually if I need items I'll go get that
2801760	2803760	When I'm walking around midtown
2803760	2805760	To catch stuff
2805760	2807760	I just kind of look around to see if there's anything new
2807760	2809760	I got one that looks like a cow
2809760	2811760	Oh the milk tank?
2811760	2813760	Or whatever it's called?
2813760	2815760	Those are apparently pretty good
2815760	2817760	I don't have one yet
2817760	2819760	So I have one of those
2819760	2821760	Yeah it's like the same shit
2821760	2823760	It's like the same shit all over the place
2823760	2825760	It's like okay well shit I've already got all those
2825760	2827760	Like I don't want any more of that crow
2827760	2829760	Witch thing
2829760	2831760	There's too many of those
2831760	2833760	And they don't evolve
2833760	2835760	Yeah they're fucking useless
2835760	2837760	They're only good to finally get
2837760	2839760	The fucking dark trophy
2839760	2841760	For catching dark types
2841760	2843760	That's what it's good for, that's it
2843760	2845760	Alright well I guess I'll do that then
2845760	2847760	Yeah I don't know, just recycle it
2847760	2849760	And JD points out it will evolve in Gen 4
2849760	2851760	Oh okay let me just wait until 2020
2851760	2853760	For that you know
2853760	2855760	Save those candies
2855760	2857760	Save those candies yeah
2859760	2861760	Alright
2861760	2863760	I have to check my demon hunter right now
2863760	2865760	On Warcraft? Oh yeah cause the whole app and all that
2865760	2867760	That's actually pretty nice
2867760	2869760	I'll tell you what I haven't really played at all this week
2869760	2871760	Ingress
2871760	2873760	Because I'm finding
2873760	2875760	Very little point to do that anymore
2875760	2877760	I've been burned out too
2877760	2879760	For me it's the fact that there's no
2879760	2881760	Like the live event thing
2881760	2883760	I know they're doing shards
2883760	2885760	But it's not exciting for me
2885760	2887760	I could give a shit about shards
2887760	2889760	The shard thing is too limited I think
2889760	2891760	And every time I hear shard I just think of shart
2891760	2893760	It's appropriate
2893760	2895760	Alright
2895760	2897760	My gaming week
2897760	2899760	So pretty much a lot of the same standbys
2899760	2901760	I've been streaming some of it on my twitch channel
2901760	2903760	Cheatplug, Rob Roberts on twitch
2903760	2905760	Please please follow me if you aren't already
2905760	2907760	I appreciate it, I've been really trying to grow
2907760	2909760	Things over there on twitch
2909760	2911760	And I've been doing more streaming
2911760	2913760	A lot of the old same
2913760	2915760	Standby stuff, Final Fantasy 14 and
2915760	2917760	Overwatch which I'm still continuing to play this week
2917760	2919760	Which by the way Loki, act deft and chat
2919760	2921760	Over at live.vognetware.com
2921760	2923760	It's practically screaming in caps, get Overwatch
2923760	2925760	Loki, yes I know everybody wants me
2925760	2927760	Everyone wants
2927760	2929760	Me to get Overwatch
2929760	2931760	A lot of people that I'm co-workers with
2931760	2933760	They play on PC so
2933760	2935760	My PC's not
2935760	2937760	I don't think it's good enough to run Overwatch
2937760	2939760	You might want to check
2939760	2941760	Sometimes Blizzard's pretty good about making sure
2941760	2943760	I need a new PC anyways
2943760	2945760	I've been looking at getting either a new laptop
2945760	2947760	Or a new desktop
2947760	2949760	But the laptops are pretty decent for the price
2949760	2951760	And now they have the new Ryzen chips that came out
2951760	2953760	Which look pretty nice
2953760	2955760	My out of date monster will run Overwatch
2955760	2957760	So
2957760	2959760	This probably will
2959760	2961760	I don't know
2961760	2963760	I would use controller though
2963760	2965760	I guess I would lose that against keyboard mouse right?
2965760	2967760	Probably
2967760	2969760	Unless, well play a character
2969760	2971760	Like Torbjorn or Symmetra where you can set up
2971760	2973760	Like turrets and robots to do
2973760	2975760	The things for you that might help
2975760	2977760	Anyway, so I've been playing some Overwatch
2977760	2979760	Then let's see I was continuing to play
2979760	2981760	Skyrim HD which I talked about a little bit last week
2981760	2983760	I was playing that a little more on
2983760	2985760	Xbox One and still really
2985760	2987760	Enjoy the graphics, like I'm like okay wow
2987760	2989760	This game really does look good you know
2989760	2991760	It makes me very excited for Elder Scrolls 6
2991760	2993760	Which I hope they announce sooner rather than later
2993760	2995760	Even though I think it's going to be a
2995760	2997760	Fallout game this year
2997760	2999760	Like a New Vegas 2 or something
2999760	3001760	Another one? But they just did Fallout 4
3001760	3003760	Fallout New Vegas 2 or whatever it is
3003760	3005760	I think is what the rumors say for this year
3005760	3007760	No
3007760	3009760	We'll see, we'll see
3009760	3011760	Other than that I did download a few new things
3011760	3013760	I did not realize
3013760	3015760	This was on Playstation 4
3015760	3017760	But I think it just came out recently
3017760	3019760	Which was a Chinese rooms
3019760	3021760	Game that they did
3021760	3023760	Before, it was only one of their first games
3023760	3025760	It was the Half-Life mod that there was a
3025760	3027760	Spinoff game before they did
3027760	3029760	Everybody's Gone to the Rapture, which you know
3029760	3031760	I loved that game, so the fact that
3031760	3033760	It was only like, because they're doing a big sale
3033760	3035760	On Playstation right now so it was only like 4 or 5 bucks
3035760	3037760	For Dear Esther even though I think it's new
3037760	3039760	On Playstation 4, it's not a new game at all
3039760	3041760	It's been out for like 10 years, but I'd never played it
3041760	3043760	So I wanted to get in there and play it
3043760	3045760	And I didn't get super far in it
3045760	3047760	I didn't really like talk about the story or anything yet
3047760	3049760	But it is really pretty
3049760	3051760	I mean, again, the fact that it's not on Playstation 4
3051760	3053760	Like, you know, walking on these
3053760	3055760	Barren cliffs
3055760	3057760	By the ocean and this grey
3057760	3059760	Very dreary setting
3059760	3061760	It does look gorgeous
3061760	3063760	For what it's worth, so I had fun with that
3063760	3065760	And then another game I downloaded which I played a little more of
3065760	3067760	Which I did enjoy
3067760	3069760	Was this little game called Enter the Gungeon
3069760	3071760	Which I played a little bit of, lowkey
3071760	3073760	I saw that
3073760	3075760	Did you see that when I was playing that?
3075760	3077760	So that was fun, I liked that
3077760	3079760	It's pretty much like a roguelike
3079760	3081760	I guess
3081760	3083760	But with guns, and yes you do
3083760	3085760	You go through the dungeon, you find stronger guns
3085760	3087760	To take on more bosses
3087760	3089760	And find more guns
3089760	3091760	And bosses based off guns
3091760	3093760	So I didn't play a lot
3093760	3095760	But I played enough, I played through the tutorial
3095760	3097760	And then I was playing the beginning stage a little bit
3097760	3099760	I got through at least the first floor
3099760	3101760	And beat one of the bosses
3101760	3103760	Which is kind of weird
3103760	3105760	So yeah I was having fun with that
3105760	3107760	And I didn't realize in the theme song
3107760	3109760	To Enter the Gungeon, they actually have a whole custom thing
3109760	3111760	Where they're actually singing about the Gungeon
3111760	3113760	So that was a nice touch
3113760	3115760	Props to them
3115760	3117760	So I was enjoying that
3117760	3119760	So that was pretty much my gaming week
3119760	3121760	Alright
3121760	3123760	I was getting into housekeeping here
3123760	3125760	But there's not a lot to tell you
3125760	3127760	Besides please follow us on Twitter
3127760	3129760	We're also on Facebook
3130760	3132760	And I do want to mention
3132760	3134760	On Twitch TV
3134760	3136760	We not only have our own channel on Twitch
3136760	3138760	Which we haven't really been using a lot of recently
3138760	3140760	Admittedly, but we are trying to build up the presence
3140760	3142760	For VOG Network over on Twitch
3142760	3144760	If you do follow VOG Network
3144760	3146760	Over on Twitch
3146760	3148760	Several of the hosts that do things here at VOG Network
3148760	3150760	We auto host their feeds
3150760	3152760	And at a later time we're hoping to bring you some content
3152760	3154760	Original to the Twitch feed of VOG Network as well
3154760	3156760	So check that out
3156760	3158760	We were talking about that a little bit on last week's show
3158760	3160760	And then Bobby went in and like
3160760	3162760	Figured out how to get back in there
3162760	3164760	And made sure it was up and running this week
3164760	3166760	So he did all that, so thanks Bobby
3166760	3168760	So check that out
3168760	3170760	Let's get into some gaming news
3170760	3172760	Lots more to cover, right Loki?
3172760	3174760	Yep, and as I was talking about
3174760	3176760	My gaming week this week I of course played
3176760	3178760	Lots of the Playstation VR
3178760	3180760	And apparently it's selling pretty well as well
3180760	3182760	So they're also
3182760	3184760	They have revealed that as of February 19th
3184760	3186760	They've sold about
3186760	3188760	915,000 units
3188760	3190760	So they're actually
3190760	3192760	Expected to hit their estimate
3192760	3194760	Of about 1 million units by mid April
3194760	3196760	Originally they were
3196760	3198760	Forecasting 2.6 million units
3198760	3200760	But of course they lowered that down to
3200760	3202760	750,000 which they've
3202760	3204760	Already exceeded, so
3204760	3206760	Good for them, apparently that makes the
3206760	3208760	Playstation VR the highest selling headset
3208760	3210760	Of the three main contenders
3210760	3212760	The Vive, Rift, and
3212760	3214760	Gear VR
3214760	3216760	Alright no I'm sorry
3216760	3218760	It's actually the Vive and the Rift
3218760	3220760	Including the Playstation VR
3220760	3222760	The Gear VR is actually I think sold
3222760	3224760	A little bit better
3224760	3226760	So hopefully this bodes well for Sony actually
3226760	3228760	Continuing to support it
3228760	3230760	Because there was some of us worried that it could go down a path like the Vita
3230760	3232760	I still think
3232760	3234760	Just everybody show that stuff
3234760	3236760	They get really
3236760	3238760	Wowed by it
3238760	3240760	So I still think it's just getting
3240760	3242760	It in the people's faces basically
3242760	3244760	To try it
3244760	3246760	And once they've tried it
3246760	3248760	I don't think I've ever had anyone go
3248760	3250760	Oh that's dumb
3250760	3252760	Or like this is never going to take off
3252760	3254760	It's always been like holy shit
3254760	3256760	Just amazing
3256760	3258760	That this is
3258760	3260760	Even a thing
3260760	3262760	And so it's just getting people to try it
3262760	3264760	And once they've tried it then they pretty much
3264760	3266760	Become evangelists for it
3266760	3268760	I don't know if you guys know
3268760	3270760	But I never did end up getting one
3270760	3272760	For Pro which in retrospect
3272760	3274760	Was probably the wrong decision to be honest
3274760	3276760	But it's okay
3276760	3278760	I own it
3278760	3280760	Well I don't know
3280760	3282760	I don't know if I'd be using the Playstation VR
3282760	3284760	The whole time if I owned it
3284760	3286760	Do you use it regularly?
3286760	3288760	I have been recently using it more often
3288760	3290760	I haven't really been playing VR games in it
3290760	3292760	But I'm always like whenever they have sales
3292760	3294760	And stuff I'm always looking to see what games are on sale
3294760	3296760	And I do have some in my backlog
3296760	3298760	That I get to play
3298760	3300760	It's funny actually the other day
3300760	3302760	I was looking through my catalog of stuff
3302760	3304760	I'm like man I thought I had more games than this
3304760	3306760	And then I looked and I'm like
3306760	3308760	Oh wait that's stuff that's been downloaded
3308760	3310760	And I'm like 187 games
3310760	3312760	Holy shit
3312760	3314760	My Playstation library is looking just like
3314760	3316760	My Steam library
3316760	3318760	But yeah there's like
3318760	3320760	Oh I bought Need for Speed
3320760	3322760	And Dragon Age Inquisition
3322760	3324760	When the fuck did that happen?
3324760	3326760	Silly stuff
3327760	3329760	Not really a game I would play
3329760	3331760	But I definitely want to try it in VR
3331760	3333760	I played for just a little bit this week
3333760	3335760	I played Rez
3335760	3337760	The new one that came out
3337760	3339760	The reimagining for the second time
3339760	3341760	But I don't have Playstation VR
3341760	3343760	I've just been playing it on the TV
3343760	3345760	And I still love it
3345760	3347760	I do kind of
3347760	3349760	If I had a VR thing I would like to play this
3349760	3351760	God so many cords everywhere
3351760	3353760	With that VR headset
3353760	3355760	My house is already a mess
3355760	3357760	I mean really
3357760	3359760	Because you just have the one that combines
3359760	3361760	The HDMI and whatever
3361760	3363760	That other thing
3363760	3365760	So it's basically
3365760	3367760	Just that and then everything plugs into it
3367760	3369760	I mean yeah you can kind of twist it up
3369760	3371760	And stuff but
3371760	3373760	Just don't be stupid don't spin around circles
3373760	3375760	Like my son does
3375760	3377760	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says the PSVR has
3377760	3379760	Almost sold as much as Eye of Judgment
3379760	3381760	No Eye of Judgment
3381760	3383760	Will never sell that
3383760	3385760	Eye of Judgment is dead
3385760	3387760	It's gone
3387760	3389760	That bet is never happening
3389760	3391760	They stopped making them
3391760	3393760	It's over
3393760	3395760	They didn't make a million of them
3395760	3397760	Unless you could always hope
3397760	3399760	Now here's what you have to do
3399760	3401760	Here's what y'all have to hope for if you want Loki in the tingle outfit
3401760	3403760	You need
3403760	3405760	And for those that are newer to OLR
3405760	3407760	And don't understand what this joke is
3407760	3409760	When the Eye of Judgment
3409760	3411760	The Playstation 3
3411760	3413760	There was this game that they were doing
3413760	3415760	With a game
3415760	3417760	It was an augmented reality card game
3417760	3419760	And it was dumb because you played an actual card game
3419760	3421760	And all it did was
3421760	3423760	Change the graphics on the TV
3423760	3425760	And it was like
3425760	3427760	Wasn't it expensive too?
3427760	3429760	It was just not a very well thought out idea
3429760	3431760	I mean I'm sure the game
3431760	3433760	We went and saw the demo
3433760	3435760	At E3 and I was just like
3435760	3437760	I don't see the point
3437760	3439760	Somebody didn't really think this through
3439760	3441760	Somebody was like
3441760	3443760	It's the Ryan Reynolds picture
3443760	3445760	But why?
3445760	3447760	But you jump to conclusions
3447760	3449760	But why?
3449760	3451760	So anyway
3451760	3453760	The whole bet was
3453760	3455760	That if they would sell
3455760	3457760	And Loki was like it's never gonna sell
3457760	3459760	So I don't even know how it happened
3459760	3461760	But Loki made a bet and said look
3461760	3463760	If the Eye of Judgment sells a million copies
3463760	3465760	I will come to the show dressed as Tingle
3465760	3467760	From the Legend of Zelda singles
3467760	3469760	It was a talk like Tingle
3469760	3471760	I don't know what the hell the thing was
3471760	3473760	Well at the time we were on camera
3473760	3475760	We were on Justin TV at the time
3475760	3477760	And so you would do your little dance on camera
3477760	3479760	And we'd all have a good laugh
3479760	3481760	But you knew in the back of your mind that's never gonna fucking happen
3481760	3483760	No it's never gonna happen
3483760	3485760	It was a safe bet
3485760	3487760	It's garbage
3487760	3489760	So here's what you all need to hope for
3489760	3491760	If you want Loki to ever dress up as Tingle
3491760	3493760	Which just isn't gonna happen at this point
3493760	3495760	And Sony does this sometimes
3495760	3497760	For a new piece of technology
3497760	3499760	Cause Sony does this right
3499760	3501760	Sony said they do the
3501760	3503760	With the Playstation
3503760	3505760	Their online magazine thing
3505760	3507760	They reclaim the name or something
3507760	3509760	So sometimes Sony will reclaim names
3509760	3511760	And use them for other things
3511760	3513760	So maybe they'll bring back Eye of Judgment
3513760	3515760	And it's like a new game
3515760	3517760	Or it's a new something
3517760	3519760	Like something in virtual reality
3519760	3521760	And it's fucking awesome and sells ten million copies
3521760	3523760	Now we can sit here and say Loki
3524760	3526760	That's not the same Eye of Judgment though
3528760	3530760	Cause someone can make a game called
3530760	3532760	The Eye of Judgment
3532760	3534760	Like a free to play game
3534760	3536760	I don't know like a one penny game
3536760	3538760	And they'll sell it and say ha ha
3538760	3540760	See they sold a million copies
3540760	3542760	No but the bet was Sony has to sell
3542760	3544760	A million copies of the Eye of Judgment
3544760	3546760	Anyhow
3546760	3548760	Not gonna happen
3548760	3550760	Let's see
3550760	3552760	Bobby Blackwolf pointing out
3553760	3555760	That's right
3555760	3557760	And I think all these years later
3557760	3559760	Bobby was very protective of the secrets
3559760	3561760	But I think I'm safe to tell you
3561760	3563760	If you never found Loki and Flappy Vog
3563760	3565760	As Tingle, it's in there
3565760	3567760	And you need to play more
3567760	3569760	I'll leave you with that
3569760	3571760	If Bobby wants to just yell it in chat
3571760	3573760	If you play enough of Loki
3573760	3575760	In Flappy Vog
3575760	3577760	Eventually you'll get Loki as Tingle
3577760	3579760	Yes it was an embarrassing part of my life
3579760	3581760	But it's hilarious actually
3581760	3583760	I recorded that
3583760	3585760	I recorded that in my car
3585760	3587760	Off my laptop in the rain
3587760	3589760	In the parking lot of my work
3589760	3591760	Because there is no quiet place
3591760	3593760	To make those noises
3593760	3595760	At my place of employment
3595760	3597760	Without
3597760	3599760	Embarrassing myself
3599760	3601760	He does the voices you guys
3601760	3603760	It's worth revisiting Flappy Vog
3603760	3605760	This week and checking that out if you never saw that
3605760	3607760	Alright anyway
3607760	3609760	Let's move on
3609760	3611760	Register participation for this week's episode of
3611760	3613760	Orange Laundry Radio at vognetwork.com
3613760	3615760	Use the passphrase, inch
3615760	3617760	ActDeft in chat points out
3617760	3619760	It was kind of random
3619760	3621760	Alright anyway let's talk about speaking of random
3621760	3623760	Fallout Fantasy 15 has been getting
3623760	3625760	Updates here and there and they finally released
3625760	3627760	What like a booster pack this week
3627760	3629760	Patch 1.05
3629760	3631760	Released this week which
3631760	3633760	Supports this new booster pack which has
3633760	3635760	Some items for fishing
3635760	3637760	All I know is it tried to download the update on my system
3637760	3639760	I don't have enough hard drive space for that
3639760	3641760	Oh gosh is it really that big of a
3641760	3643760	Hell no must have been
3643760	3645760	Well anyway there is a new level cap
3645760	3647760	For your characters you can go up to 125
3647760	3649760	In levels you can also store
3649760	3651760	200 Prompto pictures now
3651760	3653760	And there is also an MP3 player
3653760	3655760	For Noctis when you are riding on a
3655760	3657760	Chocobo which you didn't have before
3657760	3659760	But also the 1.05 update
3659760	3661760	Is the long awaited
3661760	3663760	PlayStation 4 patch
3663760	3665760	Which will allow the frame rate
3665760	3667760	To go up to a maximum of 60 frames a second
3667760	3669760	On a PlayStation Pro
3669760	3671760	I'm a PlayStation 4 Pro
3671760	3673760	Owner and let me tell you
3673760	3675760	I haven't noticed a difference
3675760	3677760	Playing Fallout Fantasy 15 under this new patch
3677760	3679760	Granted I didn't do a lot
3679760	3681760	But when I did play
3681760	3683760	I didn't notice a difference
3683760	3685760	So good job on that investment
3685760	3687760	Rob PlayStation 4 Pro
3687760	3689760	Anyway
3689760	3691760	Some users out there on the internet
3691760	3693760	Noticing that some of the frame rates
3693760	3695760	And the transition between different frame rates
3695760	3697760	Is pretty jarring
3697760	3699760	So I guess
3699760	3701760	Maybe I'm not playing in the right mode
3701760	3703760	Do I need to actually go into the high mode
3703760	3705760	Maybe that's why I didn't do right
3705760	3707760	So maybe I'll go back
3707760	3709760	And tinker with that a little bit
3709760	3711760	Just to see if I can get the game to
3711760	3713760	Look even prettier but
3713760	3715760	It looked good enough for what it's worth
3715760	3717760	Anyway
3717760	3719760	I guess near playlists were added
3719760	3721760	To the game too
3721760	3723760	As you're driving around you can actually listen to the soundtracks
3723760	3725760	Near if you want to hear that
3725760	3727760	Sure cool
3727760	3729760	Alright
3729760	3731760	How about the DLC with Gladio and all that stuff
3731760	3733760	That's what I'm really waiting for
3733760	3735760	Cup noodle
3735760	3737760	Yeah my cup noodle hat where's that
3737760	3739760	Can't wait for that
3739760	3741760	Moving on Dark Sakura
3741760	3743760	What do you have for us
3743760	3745760	I have stuff
3745760	3747760	Very sad stuff
3747760	3749760	A moment of silence if you will
3749760	3751760	Alan Stone who was the co-founder
3751760	3753760	Of Nintendo of America
3753760	3755760	Died
3755760	3757760	It was reported on February 23
3757760	3759760	He died at
3759760	3761760	71 from cancer
3761760	3763760	71 is still a decent run
3763760	3765760	But still you know
3765760	3767760	With current life spans that is
3767760	3769760	A little short still
3769760	3771760	He was
3771760	3773760	One of the people behind getting
3773760	3775760	You know the original Mario Brothers
3775760	3777760	And Donkey Kong
3777760	3779760	To be as popular as it was
3779760	3781760	Over here and so we actually
3781760	3783760	I would even say oh the
3783760	3785760	Resurgence of video gaming in America
3785760	3787760	To him so
3787760	3789760	RIP
3789760	3791760	People probably don't remember that
3791760	3793760	You know there was a lot of stores out there
3793760	3795760	That were really tepid
3795760	3797760	On stocking Nintendo
3797760	3799760	And Sega after
3799760	3801760	The huge video game crash and you know
3801760	3803760	Nintendo of America had to work very hard
3803760	3805760	To make Nintendo
3805760	3807760	A success in this country which they did
3807760	3809760	So yeah I think
3809760	3811760	We owe a lot to
3811760	3813760	You know what Alan Stone
3813760	3815760	Did and fuck cancer etc
3815760	3817760	Indeed
3817760	3819760	It's
3819760	3821760	Also I don't know was he still involved
3821760	3823760	With Nintendo in later years
3823760	3825760	Or probably not
3825760	3827760	Because I was going to say it really kind of sucks
3827760	3829760	Here we are a week before the Switch releases
3829760	3831760	I'm pretty sure he would have been excited to see that
3831760	3833760	But he probably had moved on from Nintendo
3833760	3835760	Later in his career as you know people come
3835760	3837760	And go from jobs all the time in different companies
3837760	3839760	So but anyway a tip
3839760	3841760	Of the hat there for Alan Stone
3841760	3843760	And thank you
3843760	3845760	For everything you did to set up Nintendo
3845760	3847760	In America
3847760	3849760	Loki let's change the subject
3849760	3851760	Something a little brighter please
3851760	3853760	Yes definitely a little bit brighter because
3853760	3855760	We're going to be talking about sunset overdrive
3855760	3857760	And that was a pretty bright game
3857760	3859760	Yes it was it was a very fluorescent game
3859760	3861760	So you know
3861760	3863760	It didn't do as well as Microsoft had hoped
3863760	3865760	But
3865760	3867760	They're saying that they still may continue on
3867760	3869760	Even without Microsoft
3869760	3871760	So
3871760	3873760	You know basically you know the president
3873760	3875760	Of Insomniac Ted Price
3875760	3877760	Said that while there hasn't been any movement
3877760	3879760	On a sequel you'd you know
3879760	3881760	Have asked Microsoft about that
3881760	3883760	But we're passionate about the franchise
3883760	3885760	And we own it so you may see more
3885760	3887760	Sunset in the future from us
3887760	3889760	No promises and no timeline
3889760	3891760	To speak of but it's something
3891760	3893760	That represents our willingness to create
3893760	3895760	Unexpected experiences
3895760	3897760	And of course they're working on the new Spider-Man
3897760	3899760	Right now
3899760	3901760	I would be totally down for cross-platform
3901760	3903760	Sunset overdrive game or hey
3903760	3905760	Sony exclusive
3905760	3907760	Sunset overdrive game
3907760	3909760	Oh yeah I know
3909760	3911760	I know people that really enjoyed sunset overdrive
3911760	3913760	I didn't I didn't get into it
3913760	3915760	I kind of tried to play it but I really didn't
3915760	3917760	Get into it the way I think a lot of people did
3917760	3919760	But I know there's a lot of people who'd be very happy
3919760	3921760	To see them kind of continue it because
3921760	3923760	I don't think it sold to the expectations
3923760	3925760	That Microsoft had I mean Microsoft
3925760	3927760	Gave it away during one of those games with gold
3927760	3929760	Promotions at one point so
3929760	3931760	You know I don't think it quite had the sales that
3931760	3933760	They'd hoped for but yet NAC
3933760	3935760	Still hasn't been given away yet
3935760	3937760	That's you know what that's a good point and NAC is getting a
3937760	3939760	Sequel you know what that's a darn good point so if NAC
3939760	3941760	Can get a fucking sequel why can't sunset overdrive
3941760	3943760	Get a sequel alright that's well put
3943760	3945760	Loki well put
3945760	3947760	Alright
3947760	3949760	Let's move on I know a lot of you are fans
3949760	3951760	Of Jim Sterling over on YouTube
3951760	3953760	You're one of them right Loki? Yes I am
3953760	3955760	You like to watch this well you're probably happy to hear this
3955760	3957760	I'm very aware of the situation yeah
3957760	3959760	So you probably know more about this than I do
3959760	3961760	Apparently what happened the case dismissed
3961760	3963760	This week with
3963760	3965760	Jim Sterling fighting with Digital Homicide
3965760	3967760	This was where Digital Homicide
3967760	3969760	Did what basically come out and said that
3969760	3971760	He
3971760	3973760	Basically was what slander was that what it was about?
3973760	3975760	It was a whole bunch of stuff so he had done
3975760	3977760	A bunch he does a series called
3977760	3979760	Best of Scene Greenlight where he'll show
3979760	3981760	Off games that are just garbage
3981760	3983760	And he'll like make fun of them
3983760	3985760	And then he also does you know like a let's play
3985760	3987760	Series that he does with
3987760	3989760	Different games like that and one of the games he showed
3989760	3991760	Was the Slaughtering Grounds which was this
3991760	3993760	Like you know very
3993760	3995760	Basic first person shooter game that
3995760	3997760	Used a bunch of pre-bought assets from the Unity
3997760	3999760	Store and didn't really do anything
3999760	4001760	And so he just you know
4001760	4003760	Called it like an asset flip and so
4003760	4005760	Then James Romain
4005760	4007760	Who was part of
4007760	4009760	Digital Homicide
4009760	4011760	Came out with a video slamming
4011760	4013760	Him on his review of the game
4013760	4015760	To which you know he's like this isn't a review
4015760	4017760	It's a let's play and then
4017760	4019760	So he decided to do a
4019760	4021760	Review of a review
4021760	4023760	And like did that and I think it even
4023760	4025760	Went another step further but
4025760	4027760	It came down to like they were saying that he
4027760	4029760	You know was
4029760	4031760	Slandering them and he caused them
4031760	4033760	Financial harm and they were trying to sue him for like
4033760	4035760	Ten million dollars when in reality he
4035760	4037760	Probably brought more publicity to their game
4037760	4039760	Right and then they would have had otherwise
4039760	4041760	These guys weren't exactly right in the head
4041760	4043760	Anyways let me get in the heat like
4043760	4045760	Allegedly don't sue us
4045760	4047760	He um you know
4047760	4049760	Also like did like an interview with him and stuff
4049760	4051760	And it was just it was
4051760	4053760	Cringy but so to make a
4053760	4055760	Long story short he went this
4055760	4057760	Went you know they pursued him
4057760	4059760	You know sued him and he got
4059760	4061760	A dismiss with prejudice so he's
4061760	4063760	Um you know
4063760	4065760	Free to do whatever on this he's supposed to make
4065760	4067760	Like a video about it on Monday
4067760	4069760	Actually regarding this dismissal
4069760	4071760	Um but yeah I mean these are the same guys
4071760	4073760	That try to sue steam reviews
4073760	4075760	You know sue people like
4075760	4077760	To find you know who's
4077760	4079760	Leaving bad reviews on their game so they can go off
4079760	4081760	Through them monetarily and then
4081760	4083760	Then steam of course pulled their games off of
4083760	4085760	You know
4085760	4087760	Here's the thing that I think kind of sucks about this
4087760	4089760	Is that you know there's the whole you can read
4089760	4091760	The motion for dismissal it's all public and online
4091760	4093760	Both parties have to
4093760	4095760	Bear their own attorney and filing fees
4095760	4097760	So that means he
4097760	4099760	Jim Sterling still had to pay for the attorney
4099760	4101760	And the filing which he shouldn't have to do that
4101760	4103760	No he shouldn't the other parties should have to pay for that
4103760	4105760	Here's the thing the reason the thought
4105760	4107760	Well the thought of it is
4107760	4109760	That it was more of like
4109760	4111760	Jim Sterling being nice about it because
4111760	4113760	He could have pursued it
4113760	4115760	Further to get those attorney fees but he's just kind of like
4115760	4117760	Fuck this I just want to be done with them
4117760	4119760	Using the YouTube
4119760	4121760	Ad revenue from the videos about it to pay for it
4121760	4123760	Well it's just like he just wants to be done with them
4123760	4125760	I think because he had a
4125760	4127760	Strong case to where he could have gotten damages
4127760	4129760	From them but it's more of just let's just
4129760	4131760	Forget about it you know let's just
4131760	4133760	Leave it and I'm just
4133760	4135760	Going to still make fun of you but you know
4135760	4137760	There's not much you can do about it
4137760	4139760	So you know basically now they just said
4139760	4141760	Any time that they
4141760	4143760	They're not allowed to you know file
4143760	4145760	Complaints regarding this of course
4145760	4147760	If they do file any additional complaints not
4147760	4149760	Documented in there they have to make sure
4149760	4151760	That they're considering fair use and
4151760	4153760	Some other thing I don't remember
4153760	4155760	The exact
4155760	4157760	Wording of it but yeah
4157760	4159760	I mean that's kind of what's been going on
4159760	4161760	It's been going on for a few months
4161760	4163760	Now I think
4163760	4165760	Geez
4165760	4167760	Alright well I think this is interesting too
4167760	4169760	I didn't realize this in order to file
4169760	4171760	A lawsuit in Arizona the guy
4171760	4173760	Contributed to the
4173760	4175760	Patreon a dollar a month to
4175760	4177760	Say that he does business in Arizona in order to
4177760	4179760	File the lawsuit there
4179760	4181760	It's shady shit
4181760	4183760	That is shady as fuck
4183760	4185760	Well be careful if you set up one of those
4185760	4187760	Patreons because I know a lot of people are setting
4187760	4189760	Those up but there's another great reason
4189760	4191760	Why OLR hasn't exactly
4191760	4193760	Jumped in on Patreon yet you know
4193760	4195760	Legal things like that
4195760	4197760	So anyway I don't have the fucking money
4197760	4199760	To pay a lawyer like
4199760	4201760	Anyway
4201760	4203760	Let's move on
4203760	4205760	People need to
4205760	4207760	Just stop suing everybody over stupid things
4207760	4209760	Y'all need Jesus
4209760	4211760	Or whatever
4211760	4213760	Y'all need
4213760	4215760	A lobotomy
4215760	4217760	Moving on
4217760	4219760	Y'all need to go outside right Darsyra
4219760	4221760	Yeah go outside and play some Pokemon Go
4221760	4223760	Well as
4223760	4225760	We know or may
4225760	4227760	Have known and forgotten
4227760	4229760	Or did not give a shit about
4229760	4231760	Pokemon's 21st anniversary
4231760	4233760	Is coming up so Niantic
4233760	4235760	Is doing
4235760	4237760	An event from February 26th
4237760	4239760	Until March 6th
4239760	4241760	For the anniversary
4241760	4243760	It's going to be Pokemon day
4243760	4245760	Or in that case Pokemon week
4245760	4247760	Where you can
4247760	4249760	Catch a special Pikachu
4249760	4251760	He'll be wearing a party hat
4251760	4253760	Just like the Santa Pikachus
4253760	4255760	And so I am going to be
4255760	4257760	Going on a Pikachu hunt
4257760	4259760	I'm just going to hang out in the park by your house
4259760	4261760	And hunt Pikachu
4261760	4263760	Yeah I'll have to get one of those
4263760	4265760	So I can have all the different Pikachu hats
4265760	4267760	It's all about hats
4267760	4269760	I have the um
4269760	4271760	Both the Christmas Pikachu and Raichu
4271760	4273760	And I want the party hat Pikachu and Raichu
4273760	4275760	Instead of Raichu there but I would assume Raichu would
4275760	4277760	Yeah if it's like the Santa hats
4277760	4279760	Then you should be able to evolve a Pikachu
4279760	4281760	With a party hat and get a Raichu with a party hat
4281760	4283760	Party too
4283760	4285760	But that's really it
4285760	4287760	I'm excited to catch a party too
4287760	4289760	Will they spawn more Pikachu so you have a better chance to catch them
4289760	4291760	Or are you going to have to find
4291760	4293760	I don't see anything about that
4293760	4295760	Well here's a pro tip there is some Pikachu nests
4295760	4297760	Up in Sacramento so you just have to look at
4297760	4299760	I missed my Porygon chance
4299760	4301760	You did miss your Porygon chance
4301760	4303760	They were all over during the Valentine day event
4303760	4305760	Well I'll just do it next year
4305760	4307760	That's what they all say
4307760	4309760	Alright
4309760	4311760	He's saying in his best Adore Delano voice
4311760	4313760	Party
4313760	4315760	Party
4315760	4317760	Loki what do you have for us before we get to the classic game of the week
4317760	4319760	So apparently now you have
4319760	4321760	The ability through Twitch to
4321760	4323760	Change your name
4323760	4325760	Now changing your username
4325760	4327760	Also not only does it change your name
4327760	4329760	That everyone can view it
4329760	4331760	It also changes your channels URL
4331760	4333760	Of course
4333760	4335760	They're saying that your old URL won't
4335760	4337760	Redirect to the new one
4337760	4339760	And then you can use that feature
4339760	4341760	Once every 60 days
4341760	4343760	And of course you can only change
4343760	4345760	The name that's available
4345760	4347760	I never realized
4347760	4349760	That you could not change your Twitch name
4349760	4351760	This seems like one of those
4351760	4353760	Really obvious things
4353760	4355760	That I wonder why it wasn't in place before
4355760	4357760	But okay
4357760	4359760	Well I know
4359760	4361760	In the past certain things have been tied
4361760	4363760	To actual names on the accounts
4363760	4365760	Like an account number
4365760	4367760	And so if they
4367760	4369760	Made that change
4369760	4371760	Where they assigned account numbers to everything
4371760	4373760	Then they could do that
4373760	4375760	Because that was like
4375760	4377760	I think Sony
4377760	4379760	Can you change your name on the
4379760	4381760	Playstation now
4381760	4383760	No and that's a very
4383760	4385760	That's a thing that some people have problems with
4385760	4387760	I thought that was something they were working on
4387760	4389760	So I think that's the same process
4389760	4391760	They have to assign your account a number
4391760	4393760	And once they have everybody to a number
4393760	4395760	They can go and allow you to
4395760	4397760	Change those names
4399760	4401760	Alright
4401760	4403760	So if I want to change my name to Mob Moberts
4403760	4405760	I can do that now
4405760	4407760	Yes, as long as it's not taken
4407760	4409760	As long as it's not already taken
4409760	4411760	Don't take it or I'll sue you like that guy
4411760	4413760	Alright let's talk about this
4413760	4415760	Before we get into the classic game of the week
4415760	4417760	And it has to do with Unity
4417760	4419760	The Unity game engine is
4419760	4421760	Being used for more than just games
4421760	4423760	There's other things that are using it
4423760	4425760	In fact there's a brand new French
4425760	4427760	Animation show called Mr. Carton
4427760	4429760	That is now the first
4429760	4431760	Cartoon TV series
4431760	4433760	Made in Unity
4433760	4435760	So now you can make a television cartoon
4435760	4437760	In Unity, which makes me think
4437760	4439760	How easy would it be to port that cartoon to other devices
4439760	4441760	Through Unity
4441760	4443760	Which also makes me think
4443760	4445760	Remember when the 3DS was going to get movies
4445760	4447760	Whatever happened to that?
4447760	4449760	What happened to Tron or Tangled
4449760	4451760	In 3D on the DS, what happened to that?
4451760	4453760	Instead we got Dinosaur Office
4453760	4455760	Look at Tekken, the Tekken movie was in
4455760	4457760	Was the Tekken movie out?
4457760	4459760	Because I think if there was a version of Tekken
4459760	4461760	On the 3DS
4461760	4463760	That actually had that movie
4463760	4465760	Bundled with it
4465760	4467760	I was going to say
4467760	4469760	This is something that they've been pushing with Unity
4469760	4471760	Because they had that whole tech demo
4471760	4473760	I don't know if it was just for Unity 5
4473760	4475760	Or whatever the version of Unity was
4475760	4477760	But they had this big cinematic
4477760	4479760	Thing that they put out
4479760	4481760	And they were saying
4481760	4483760	Yeah, you could use it for making movies
4483760	4485760	Yeah, Mr. Carton
4485760	4487760	Has a 13 episode season that is
4487760	4489760	Premiering on France
4489760	4491760	Televisions this week
4491760	4493760	There's also, I guess 6 episodes have already
4493760	4495760	Aired and you can actually go check it out on YouTube
4495760	4497760	If you want, they're just short little
4497760	4499760	2 minute adventures
4499760	4501760	And I guess the language barrier
4501760	4503760	Doesn't really prevent you from enjoying it
4503760	4505760	Because the cartoon doesn't say much
4505760	4507760	So you can still kind of enjoy it there
4507760	4509760	I didn't watch it myself to be honest
4509760	4511760	But maybe I will knowing that
4511760	4513760	I don't need to know a lot of French to be able to understand it
4513760	4515760	The creator of Mr. Carton
4515760	4517760	Found Unity to be very suitable
4517760	4519760	For the process saying that sequencing was a lot less
4519760	4521760	Challenging in Unity than it is
4521760	4523760	With more traditional methods
4523760	4525760	Storyboarding and mastering were handled with other applications
4525760	4527760	But set building, lighting
4527760	4529760	Rendering and so forth
4529760	4531760	Was done with Unity
4531760	4533760	So that's pretty cool
4533760	4535760	A cartoon
4535760	4537760	All out of Unity
4537760	4539760	Alright, let's go back to a simpler time
4539760	4541760	When you can just
4541760	4543760	Program your own game
4543760	4545760	You can just create any game you wanted
4545760	4547760	Unless it was like pinball construction
4547760	4549760	Set or something
4549760	4551760	It's the classic game of the week
4551760	4553760	Where Dark Soccer is going to step into the gaming vault
4553760	4555760	And find a game that she thinks
4555760	4557760	Hey, you brat
4557760	4559760	Enough with your newfangled
4559760	4561760	Switches
4561760	4563760	I'll show you a switch
4563760	4565760	Nipple clips
4565760	4567760	You'll go out to the yard and pick your own
4567760	4569760	Which is psychological warfare
4569760	4571760	Believe me
4571760	4573760	Dark Sakura
4573760	4575760	What is the classic game of the week
4575760	4577760	That the kids should be reading about and playing
4577760	4579760	The game is Crazy Chase
4579760	4581760	Or as we had it in the US
4581760	4583760	Casey's Crazy Chase
4583760	4585760	Who remembers when I did
4585760	4587760	Casey Munchkin a while back?
4587760	4589760	Not me
4589760	4591760	No, actually I thought you had already done this game
4591760	4593760	Because you did do Casey Munchkin
4593760	4595760	And I forgot they were different games
4595760	4597760	I have to talk about a slight bit
4597760	4599760	Because there was a big
4599760	4601760	Casey Munchkin was sued
4601760	4603760	Well, I'd say Phillips was sued
4603760	4605760	By Atari
4605760	4607760	Phillips Magnavox
4607760	4609760	Because Casey
4609760	4611760	While they didn't advertise
4611760	4613760	That Casey Munchkin was
4613760	4615760	Like Pac-Man
4615760	4617760	In fact, they were very clear not to say it
4617760	4619760	So many other people drew the comparison
4619760	4621760	And were advertising it
4621760	4623760	That way in catalogs
4623760	4625760	Even though they said don't do it
4625760	4627760	That they got sued
4627760	4629760	By Atari
4629760	4631760	Because Atari at that point had the home license
4631760	4633760	For Pac-Man
4633760	4635760	They
4635760	4637760	Magnavox won the first suit
4637760	4639760	But Atari
4639760	4641760	Appealed and won the
4641760	4643760	Second court case
4643760	4645760	So that's that whole drama
4645760	4647760	In a nutshell
4647760	4649760	Casey Crazy Chase was a
4649760	4651760	Sequel and a response
4651760	4653760	And of course anything that has
4653760	4655760	The Casey name in it
4655760	4657760	Comes from the
4657760	4659760	Phillips electronic president
4659760	4661760	At the time, Casey Mencken
4661760	4663760	So, there you go
4663760	4665760	But this game is a sequel to Casey Munchkin
4665760	4667760	In this game, it is still a map game
4667760	4669760	And it actually does have
4669760	4671760	A lot of the features of Casey Munchkin
4671760	4673760	They came out
4673760	4675760	In, let's see
4675760	4677760	In the UK on the
4677760	4679760	Phillips video pack and in North America
4679760	4681760	On the Magnavox Odyssey 2
4681760	4683760	But this game
4683760	4685760	It has a twist on the whole thing
4685760	4687760	So in Casey Munchkin
4687760	4689760	You had drats
4689760	4691760	The little monsters living in the maze
4691760	4693760	And, you know, your little guy
4693760	4695760	Would walk around
4695760	4697760	And eat them and eat dots and stuff
4697760	4699760	You know, kind of, yeah
4699760	4701760	Pac-Man-y
4701760	4703760	You know, had
4703760	4705760	The same plethora
4705760	4707760	Of mazes in the level editor
4707760	4709760	But it just changed everything up
4709760	4711760	So, you didn't have the dots
4711760	4713760	And power pellet lookalikes
4713760	4715760	You know, at all
4715760	4717760	And instead you had the drats
4717760	4719760	Who were the monsters
4719760	4721760	Who would walk around growing trees
4721760	4723760	And you could go around and eat the trees
4723760	4725760	But you only got one point per tree
4725760	4727760	Your main objective was the dratapillar
4727760	4729760	The dratapillar
4729760	4731760	I would say bears more than a striking
4731760	4733760	Resemblance to, uh,
4733760	4735760	Centipede
4735760	4737760	In its kind of ball-shaped body
4737760	4739760	So I'm gonna call Loki in the future
4739760	4741760	The dratapillar
4741760	4743760	Um, and anyway
4743760	4745760	The way that you solve
4745760	4747760	The levels and get points
4747760	4749760	The big points are by going around
4749760	4751760	And eating the dratapillar's body
4751760	4753760	Now, first of all
4753760	4755760	I love, like, the little
4755760	4757760	Munchkin guy in here
4757760	4759760	He rolls around all over the place and grins
4759760	4761760	And when he wins
4761760	4763760	He kinda smirks and winks at you
4763760	4765760	Like, they do like a half smile
4765760	4767760	It's just funny and clever
4767760	4769760	But anyway, the dratapillar's head
4769760	4771760	Will totally kill you
4771760	4773760	So you have to go and you have to chase
4773760	4775760	Behind it and eat its body
4775760	4777760	And so when you have eaten all of its body
4777760	4779760	Um
4779760	4781760	You can, um
4781760	4783760	You can also eat pieces in the middle too
4783760	4785760	But it leaves those body parts there
4785760	4787760	The dratapillar
4787760	4789760	The dratapillar will totally kill you
4789760	4791760	And you have to eat its body
4791760	4793760	It's kinda morbid, isn't it?
4793760	4795760	Coming up next on Casey Munchkin
4795760	4797760	But, um
4797760	4799760	But yeah, you can actually even just cut the segment
4799760	4801760	By its head off by eating it
4801760	4803760	Which leaves the rest of the segment there
4803760	4805760	What kind of fucked up things are we teaching children?
4805760	4807760	It's the 80s, Rob. No one cared
4807760	4809760	Um, so when you eat a segment
4809760	4811760	Of the dratapillar, it actually turns the drats
4811760	4813760	White
4813760	4815760	And what's kinda funny is like
4815760	4817760	It's like in those old cartoons, you know
4817760	4819760	Where the roadrunner would run by the
4819760	4821760	Coyote and he'd be spinning in the middle of the road
4821760	4823760	That's kinda what it does, it's pretty cool
4823760	4825760	Um
4825760	4827760	And you get 10 points for stunning them
4827760	4829760	So that's, you know, different ways
4829760	4831760	To, um, to score
4831760	4833760	You know, bigger points in the game
4833760	4835760	But of course, every time you eat a piece of the dratapillar's
4835760	4837760	Body, it speeds up
4837760	4839760	So, um
4839760	4841760	You just have to pretty much be
4841760	4843760	Fast, think quickly
4843760	4845760	And, um
4845760	4847760	You know, run through it. Now, one of the other
4847760	4849760	Things about this though
4849760	4851760	Is that it supported the Odyssey 2's voice
4851760	4853760	Add-on module
4853760	4855760	Which basically, it, um
4855760	4857760	It would
4857760	4859760	Hum, like, background music
4859760	4861760	Um, through the game
4861760	4863760	And then you'd get like, oh no!
4863760	4865760	When you die, or laughter
4865760	4867760	Or different things
4867760	4869760	Um, and of course, with this game
4869760	4871760	You get one life
4871760	4873760	So, but it's
4873760	4875760	It's a neat little game, you know
4875760	4877760	It was definitely
4877760	4879760	A unique twist on the maze game genre
4879760	4881760	And one of the better games
4881760	4883760	That came out for the Odyssey 2
4883760	4885760	I spent a lot of time
4885760	4887760	As a kid, well at the time
4887760	4889760	I had a Colecovision
4889760	4891760	I'll take that back, this was a house before that
4891760	4893760	I didn't have a video game system
4893760	4895760	We had, uh, The Neighbors, uh, Odyssey 2
4895760	4897760	I have, I have
4897760	4899760	One now, and I eventually got one
4899760	4901760	Later, but, um
4901760	4903760	I spent so much time on this one
4903760	4905760	And, um, what was that other
4905760	4907760	Fucking game that had the board game?
4909760	4911760	I don't remember. I'll remember it
4911760	4913760	When I'm totally not thinking
4913760	4915760	About this. I think I've even done
4915760	4917760	It for a segment too, so my brain's kinda
4917760	4919760	Too much coding
4919760	4921760	Alright, well there it is. But yeah, Casey
4921760	4923760	Uh, Casey's Crazy Chase, also known
4923760	4925760	As just Crazy Chase elsewhere. One way
4925760	4927760	Or another. It's Casey's Crazy Chase
4927760	4929760	Your classic game of the week
4929760	4931760	You only get one life
4931760	4933760	And you have to eat the body
4933760	4935760	You better not let
4935760	4937760	That Dratapillar fuck you up
4937760	4939760	And you better eat its body
4941760	4943760	And then once you've
4943760	4945760	Devoured that Dratapillar
4945760	4947760	You're gonna smile and wink and nod
4949760	4951760	Did you see when- I did, I was watching
4951760	4953760	This fucking hilarious- This very rudimentary
4953760	4955760	Little Atari 2600, excuse me
4955760	4957760	Odyssey level graphics of a little
4957760	4959760	Winking face. Like, I just ate
4959760	4961760	His entire body. He's like, hey
4961760	4963760	Atari, wink
4963760	4965760	Fuck you
4965760	4967760	Next time, I'm gonna eat you from the inside out
4967760	4969760	It's what I think of your centipede
4969760	4971760	Yum, yum, yum. He's a Dratapillar
4971760	4973760	Now
4973760	4975760	I mean, bleep bleep bleep
4975760	4977760	And Stoppy is helping you out
4977760	4979760	Quest for the Rings. That was it, thank you
4979760	4981760	Was the board game. I was like, it was something
4982760	4984760	And you have done that as a classic game before
4984760	4986760	I have, but we, you know, we had
4986760	4988760	Like, it was the full thing. We just said fuck the board game
4988760	4989760	We just play the game
4989760	4991760	Quest for the Rings, I mean, I remember
4991760	4993760	That was a pretty, like, for what it was
4993760	4995760	An old ass game, that was a pretty
4995760	4997760	Rich, like, pretty
4997760	4999760	Big game, you know what I mean? Like
4999760	5001760	The things that it did going into the different rooms and stuff
5001760	5003760	We were just like, first graders
5003760	5005760	That didn't give a shit
5005760	5007760	For second grade, we're like, whatever, we're just gonna play the game
5007760	5009760	The other thing I was really good at was
5009760	5011760	Crypt equip. I think that's what it was called
5011760	5013760	It's the word scramble game
5013760	5015760	But I was always really good at this, so whatever
5015760	5017760	Whatever
5017760	5018760	Alright, that's it
5018760	5020760	The word is Dratapillar
5020760	5022760	Dratapillar
5022760	5024760	You know what? I say now
5024760	5026760	That if anyone is a shit in chat
5026760	5028760	They're the Dratapillar
5028760	5030760	And will eat their bodies and leave the head
5032760	5033760	That's kinda weird
5033760	5034760	Poisonous little heads
5034760	5036760	That's very weird, you're weird, stop being weird
5036760	5038760	You know what?
5038760	5040760	So are you, you hang out with me
5040760	5042760	What does that say about you?
5042760	5044760	When I'm forced to
5044760	5046760	Bitch
5046760	5048760	Alright, we're gonna take a quick break
5048760	5050760	Hey Rob, let me do a goddamn break
5050760	5052760	No, Rob!
5052760	5054760	What?
5054760	5056760	Plenty more of this to come
5056760	5058760	When we come back with more of
5058760	5060760	Orange Lounge Radio
5060760	5062760	Right after this
5063760	5065760	Welcome back everybody to
5065760	5067760	Orange Lounge Radio
5067760	5069760	Live tonight with the
5069760	5071760	677th episode of our show
5071760	5073760	Already in Progress
5073760	5075760	I'm here, Loki's here
5075760	5077760	Dark Soccer is here
5077760	5079760	And you're here, thanks for listening to us
5079760	5081760	Be it live, during the
5081760	5083760	Oscar ceremonies
5083760	5085760	Which I know has been distracting for some people
5085760	5087760	I have not even been paying attention
5087760	5089760	I did see some of the pictures of people on the red carpet though
5089760	5091760	Even though I don't usually get into all that fashion stuff
5091760	5093760	Outside of like Project Runway
5093760	5095760	I'm waiting for the fashion photo review version
5095760	5097760	The fashion photo review or whatever?
5097760	5099760	Some of the people on the red carpet look really good
5099760	5101760	I gotta say, there's been some really good outfits on the red carpet
5101760	5103760	Did you see what Janelle Monae was wearing?
5103760	5105760	No, was it a suit?
5105760	5107760	No, no it was not, it was very much like a
5107760	5109760	Like a triangular dress type of thing
5109760	5111760	She looked like she could have been a boss in Final Fantasy
5111760	5113760	It was great
5113760	5115760	Go look some of these dresses up
5115760	5117760	Look amazing on the runway
5117760	5119760	Anyhow, I wanted to ask you guys about this before we got into
5119760	5121760	Fire News, before the show, one of our listeners
5121760	5123760	Tiger Claw sent me a link
5123760	5125760	And I thought this was an interesting thing to talk about
5125760	5127760	Since we do like to do classic games, right
5127760	5129760	And you know, play old games sometimes
5129760	5131760	And sometimes we have to rely
5131760	5133760	On emulation to provide
5133760	5135760	Those games that
5135760	5137760	You know, might not be accessible otherwise
5137760	5139760	And that happened to a Super Nintendo
5139760	5141760	Game this past week, Quick the Thunder Rabbit
5141760	5143760	Was a platformer for the Super Nintendo
5143760	5145760	That was never released, it was a port I guess
5145760	5147760	Of an Amiga title
5147760	5149760	Oh, did you find the picture?
5149760	5151760	Yeah, she's got like the whole
5153760	5155760	Fuck, French Revolution
5155760	5157760	18th century French
5157760	5159760	Dress
5159760	5161760	The hip bustle
5161760	5163760	Can I talk about the Thunder Rabbit, please?
5163760	5165760	I guess
5165760	5167760	Don't talk about our competition tonight
5167760	5169760	Janelle Monae, she's talented, but she's our competition, Dark Sakura
5169760	5171760	Stop talking about her
5171760	5173760	Anyway, so Quick the Thunder Rabbit on Super Nintendo
5173760	5175760	Was a port of an Amiga title
5175760	5177760	And I guess it was a platformer
5177760	5179760	And it would be like one of those auto scrolling shooter
5179760	5181760	Games and fighting games and what have you
5181760	5183760	So somebody actually found
5183760	5185760	A copy of this game, this user
5185760	5187760	Online, but he altered the game
5187760	5189760	When he released it, he edited in a
5189760	5191760	Splash game, or excuse me
5191760	5193760	A splash screen to the start of the game
5193760	5195760	And then made some
5195760	5197760	Small alterations to the game's
5197760	5199760	Code, I'm assuming to
5199760	5201760	Make it run better or
5201760	5203760	Run more appropriately
5203760	5205760	Maybe on the forum where this was released
5205760	5207760	SNES Central asked
5207760	5209760	In the interest of preservation, would it be possible
5209760	5211760	To upload the unedited ROM image
5211760	5213760	And the answer was
5213760	5215760	No
5215760	5217760	So some people feeling like
5217760	5219760	This is that horrible
5219760	5221760	Gigantic TMZ
5221760	5223760	Watermark on a popular
5223760	5225760	Photo
5225760	5227760	Or it's like you own a very
5227760	5229760	Rare painting
5229760	5231760	And you decide to paint your initials
5231760	5233760	Or what was that painting
5233760	5235760	Where somebody like repainted Jesus'
5235760	5237760	Face, this is a thing that was like
5237760	5239760	In the news a couple years
5239760	5241760	Ago where some gal got a rare
5241760	5243760	Painting and she painted over the face
5243760	5245760	Or something, it was horrible, anyway
5245760	5247760	So some people are saying this like that
5247760	5249760	But it's funny because I'm kind of reminded
5249760	5251760	Of like back in the day
5251760	5253760	On like games on Commodore 64
5253760	5255760	And like the older
5255760	5257760	PC games, like the splash screens
5257760	5259760	And the built in trainers and all that shit
5259760	5261760	Was par for the course, you would see that
5261760	5263760	Everywhere
5263760	5265760	But at the same time I also understand why
5265760	5267760	It's like dude this is not a
5267760	5269760	Common game by any means
5269760	5271760	You have the one copy potentially
5271760	5273760	Give us the actual game
5273760	5275760	It's kind of a dick move but hey at least you have a copy of the game now
5275760	5277760	Yeah
5277760	5279760	You can play, I mean yeah it sucks that
5279760	5281760	There were some changes but it's better than nothing
5281760	5283760	I suppose it's better than nothing
5283760	5285760	DarkSakura you're big on classic games
5285760	5287760	Do you think this is defacing a classic
5287760	5289760	Painting or they have the right to
5289760	5291760	Do this because they're the only people that have it
5291760	5293760	I truly do believe that it is
5293760	5295760	Definitely doing
5295760	5297760	An injustice
5297760	5299760	To the game
5299760	5301760	So
5301760	5303760	I think that if
5303760	5305760	It
5305760	5307760	Well at least, I understand winning it out for preservation
5307760	5309760	At least in the sake of this
5309760	5311760	Having an unedited
5311760	5313760	ROM of the game
5313760	5315760	Should be still
5315760	5317760	Distributed for that preservation purpose
5317760	5319760	In its unadulterated form
5319760	5321760	It's sort of like
5321760	5323760	Or how about like this, let me put it this way
5323760	5325760	Imagine where they found
5325760	5327760	All of those, you do the x-ray
5327760	5329760	Of the paintings to see the original painting
5329760	5331760	Underneath it right
5331760	5333760	Like for example the beached whale
5333760	5335760	That was in that one piece of artwork
5335760	5337760	Or going into Van Gogh's work
5337760	5339760	And finding
5339760	5341760	His, that he's painted over other
5341760	5343760	Works, you know it's kind of
5343760	5345760	The same thing
5345760	5347760	Whether or not it's done in
5347760	5349760	Um
5349760	5351760	What's the word I'm thinking of
5351760	5353760	Done out of
5353760	5355760	Good taste, done out of
5355760	5357760	Respect, like good intentions
5357760	5359760	Good intentions, or even if there had been malice
5359760	5361760	Behind it, there was no malice in this
5361760	5363760	At the same time
5363760	5365760	It would still be
5365760	5367760	A shame
5367760	5369760	I don't think they would have had a problem if they just like
5369760	5371760	Fixed it to run or something like that
5371760	5373760	Like he put a splash screen
5373760	5375760	No, actually some people believe
5375760	5377760	And this story that Tigerclaw sent me
5377760	5379760	Went on into like an interview with some video game
5379760	5381760	And actually says, even though
5381760	5383760	This guy doesn't think he's doing harm
5383760	5385760	Because he's trying to make the game more playable
5385760	5387760	It actually still is a disservice because this is a piece
5387760	5389760	Of gaming's history, you know
5389760	5391760	He's not the guy who created the original game
5391760	5393760	I can see that perspective
5393760	5395760	Here's, okay, here's another one
5395760	5397760	And this is gonna be highly controversial
5397760	5399760	But I'm gonna use something that's been a point
5399760	5401760	Of contention in religious circles
5401760	5403760	The writings of Josephus
5403760	5405760	Have been altered ever since
5405760	5407760	Like
5407760	5409760	Were altered to say that yes
5409760	5411760	He saw Jesus
5411760	5413760	The original writings never said that
5413760	5415760	I see, I see
5415760	5417760	But it's the same thing where it goes
5417760	5419760	In and makes an alteration
5419760	5421760	It's revisionist history is what it is
5421760	5423760	It's kind of like how you have
5423760	5425760	The King James version of the Bible
5425760	5427760	Right, not to get too religious, but
5427760	5429760	That's also historical
5429760	5431760	Not just that, it wasn't necessarily
5431760	5433760	An interpretation of it, it was
5433760	5435760	Altered
5435760	5437760	By picking certain
5437760	5439760	Items in translation and putting
5439760	5441760	Them into a way that politically
5441760	5443760	Benefited his regime
5443760	5445760	And in this case, we don't know
5445760	5447760	The reason that this guy did this
5447760	5449760	If it was as some type of
5449760	5451760	Reflection on himself
5451760	5453760	Or some way to hold power
5453760	5455760	Over the community, we don't know that
5455760	5457760	My thought is, maybe there's
5457760	5459760	Two answers here, like
5459760	5461760	Release the original cart the way
5461760	5463760	It was done if it's broken or whatever
5463760	5465760	And then go ahead and alter it
5465760	5467760	Release the fixed one and now put your initials on it
5467760	5469760	Because you did fix the game
5469760	5471760	Stope has another good comparison
5471760	5473760	The Diary of Anne Frank
5473760	5475760	Her father edited it to remove
5475760	5477760	Her talks about her
5477760	5479760	Puberty, sexuality
5479760	5481760	You know, different things that young women
5481760	5483760	Go through, sure
5483760	5485760	But again, it's revisionist
5485760	5487760	It's, in this case,
5487760	5489760	More of a patriarchal type of control, but still
5489760	5491760	But it's the same thing
5491760	5493760	I look at this as no different
5493760	5495760	Dungeon Buster, with an interesting
5495760	5497760	Perspective, though, that I think is worth sharing
5497760	5499760	Over at live.vognetwork.com, says
5499760	5501760	On the other hand, a lot of the preserved games
5501760	5503760	On sites like archive.org
5503760	5505760	For old PCs, they open with
5505760	5507760	Cracked screens because they're the
5507760	5509760	Only ones available
5509760	5511760	And kind of like I said
5511760	5513760	You know, even though a lot of us
5513760	5515760	Kind of see what's going on now
5515760	5517760	As a negative, what this guy is
5517760	5519760	Doing was perfectly par
5519760	5521760	For the course in the 80s and early 90s
5521760	5523760	It's like a B
5523760	5525760	It's not an A
5525760	5527760	Of just releasing it, but hey, you know what
5527760	5529760	It's working
5529760	5531760	It's a B movie? What is it?
5531760	5533760	You're rated on a scale, you know
5533760	5535760	It's like a B, you know
5535760	5537760	It could have been better if you released an altered
5537760	5539760	But at least it's out there
5539760	5541760	It's like a B
5541760	5543760	I give it three stars
5543760	5545760	Out of five
5545760	5547760	Three out of five
5547760	5549760	Alright, let's do some
5549760	5551760	Rapid fire news
5551760	5553760	Go around quickly and talk about some of the things
5553760	5555760	That have been happening in the game industry this week
5555760	5557760	Loki, speaking of something I would give
5557760	5559760	Three out of five, Irrational
5559760	5561760	Games, they've changed the name of their
5561760	5563760	Studio to Ghost
5563760	5565760	Story Games
5565760	5567760	Goatsy Games? That's irrational
5567760	5569760	Ghost Story Games
5569760	5571760	Ghost Story Games
5571760	5573760	I hope that you're only making spooky games
5573760	5575760	Their reasoning before
5575760	5577760	They said was because
5577760	5579760	It was irrational
5579760	5581760	Because ghost stories are immersive, exciting
5581760	5583760	And steeped in the community
5583760	5585760	That reminds us of our mission
5587760	5589760	Really, it's just because you couldn't
5589760	5591760	You're like, ah crap, we gotta
5591760	5593760	Come up with something guys
5593760	5595760	Ghost Stories
5595760	5597760	I have a ghost story for you all
5597760	5599760	Knock knock
5599760	5601760	Who's there? Boo
5601760	5603760	Boo
5603760	5605760	Who? Don't cry
5605760	5607760	I have a ghost story for you
5607760	5609760	What? The Phantom
5609760	5611760	Of the opera?
5611760	5613760	No no no, what was that machine
5613760	5615760	That we saw at E3
5615760	5617760	Oh oh
5617760	5619760	Where's my shade sound?
5619760	5621760	That was like a C plus
5621760	5623760	Joke, but it was a little intellectual
5623760	5625760	For the show
5625760	5627760	Coleco Chameleon Zero
5627760	5629760	I give that joke
5629760	5631760	A two out of five
5631760	5633760	You know what, if I were to
5633760	5635760	Roll my eyes any higher, I'd be looking
5635760	5637760	At your backyard
5637760	5639760	Actually you'd be looking at a sheet that
5639760	5641760	That's covering the backyard, anyway
5643760	5645760	JD and Chaz is
5645760	5647760	So that's a boot
5647760	5649760	Are we gonna toot it or boot it?
5649760	5651760	Alright please move on please move on
5651760	5653760	We'll keep moving on
5653760	5655760	So hey, guess what
5655760	5657760	There's gonna be some more games that are
5657760	5659760	Backwards compatible with the Xbox One
5659760	5661760	Toot
5661760	5663760	So Assassin's Creed Rogue
5663760	5665760	Borderlands 2
5665760	5667760	Which is also I think one of the games of the
5667760	5669760	Gold this month as well
5669760	5671760	And
5671760	5673760	King of Fighters 2002 unlimited match
5673760	5675760	Are now backwards compatible
5675760	5677760	That's cool
5677760	5679760	Yeah so
5679760	5681760	Yeah especially with the fact that
5681760	5683760	Borderlands 2 they're kind of giving away
5683760	5685760	For free
5685760	5687760	Seriously if you have not played Borderlands
5687760	5689760	My god
5689760	5691760	Go play Borderlands
5691760	5693760	Borderlands 2 is fucking awesome
5693760	5695760	Wasn't one of the big games on Xbox One
5695760	5697760	Early on and PlayStation 4 to be fair
5697760	5699760	The Handsome Jack collection
5699760	5701760	Yes I have that in my library
5701760	5703760	Fucking haven't played it at all
5703760	5705760	What's funny about that is that
5705760	5707760	Half that is Borderlands 2
5707760	5709760	But they went back
5709760	5711760	And what HD-ified it
5711760	5713760	I think it wasn't that board
5713760	5715760	Handsome Jack collection I was one and two
5715760	5717760	No no it's two and the
5717760	5719760	Whatever that
5719760	5721760	Pre-sequel that one
5721760	5723760	One is not in the Handsome Jack collection
5723760	5725760	I haven't played Pre-sequel yet so that might be worth it
5725760	5727760	Once again though
5727760	5729760	I'm getting into that groove where like
5729760	5731760	I buy a bunch of shit I'm never gonna play
5731760	5733760	It's as bad as Steam
5733760	5735760	I've kind of stopped that on Steam for the most part
5735760	5737760	For the most part
5739760	5741760	Oh YYR in chat says Space Invaders Infinity
5741760	5743760	Gene that's one of the games
5743760	5745760	That's backwards compatible now
5745760	5747760	Hell yeah if that is one of them
5747760	5749760	YYR
5749760	5751760	If it is it's not in this release
5751760	5753760	That was a great game on 360
5753760	5755760	I love when those games
5755760	5757760	I bought on 360 just randomly
5757760	5759760	Show up on my Xbox One one day
5759760	5761760	There we go call them back to the
5761760	5763760	Very opening moments of the show
5763760	5765760	Things Microsoft is doing right
5765760	5767760	Backwards compatibility
5767760	5769760	Better than anybody else right now
5769760	5771760	Isn't that great that purchases you made on a previous system
5771760	5773760	Roll over to a newer system
5773760	5775760	Isn't that something?
5775760	5777760	That's so crazy
5777760	5779760	It's as if
5779760	5781760	With Nintendo where Virtual Console has persisted
5781760	5783760	With the Wii and the Wii U
5783760	5785760	And now eventually on the Switch
5785760	5787760	As if somehow
5787760	5789760	They would have some sort of record that you made
5789760	5791760	Those purchases
5791760	5793760	If only they had the forethought to do that
5793760	5795760	Too bad
5795760	5797760	Too bad that other companies don't have
5797760	5799760	A unified marketplace like that
5799760	5801760	Like Sony
5801760	5803760	Oh wait Sony
5803760	5805760	Too bad we can't bring those
5805760	5807760	Backwards compatibility
5807760	5809760	The Playstation Pro is just
5809760	5811760	Not strong enough
5811760	5813760	To emulate something the PSP can emulate
5813760	5815760	Anyway
5815760	5817760	YYR says
5817760	5819760	The full list is
5819760	5821760	Borderlands 2, Assassin's Creed, Rogue, King of Fighters
5821760	5823760	2002, Gyromancer
5823760	5825760	Moondiver and Space Invaders
5825760	5827760	Infinity Gene
5827760	5829760	Which is funny cause
5829760	5831760	Is Gyromancer that Square Enix puzzle game?
5831760	5833760	Cause I own that one too
5833760	5835760	And I had Moondiver so I had like three of those games
5835760	5837760	I didn't even realize that
5837760	5839760	I have not fired up my Xbox One games library
5839760	5841760	Every time I've been firing that up recently
5841760	5843760	I've just been going right into Skyrim
5843760	5845760	Ah yes I do see them on the list now that I actually
5845760	5847760	Cause this is a, wow
5847760	5849760	That is one extensive list there
5849760	5851760	Oh what of all the 360
5851760	5853760	Of all the games that are backwards compatible
5853760	5855760	I know, if you haven't checked your Xbox One
5855760	5857760	In a while, like go into your games library
5857760	5859760	And just look like in your two download list
5859760	5861760	You might just find like
5861760	5863760	Surprise, you've got like 12 games that you bought
5863760	5865760	On Xbox 360 that are now backwards compatible
5865760	5867760	That's happened to me quite a bit
5867760	5869760	I mean, they fucking got
5869760	5871760	Beat and groovy working on Xbox One
5871760	5873760	Backwards compatibility
5873760	5875760	Why did somebody waste their fucking breath
5875760	5877760	Even testing to see if that game loaded
5877760	5879760	Like that's amazing
5879760	5881760	That is amazing
5881760	5883760	That's dedication
5883760	5885760	Alright, anyway
5885760	5887760	Ah hey, a follow up
5887760	5889760	To something we talked about last week
5889760	5891760	In the case of the
5891760	5893760	Missing box of Super Nintendo
5893760	5895760	Games that went missing
5895760	5897760	I guess it was blamed for the
5897760	5899760	Lost in transit, yeah, lost in transit
5899760	5901760	Lost in transit, you know
5901760	5903760	Pretty quick to blame somebody stealing it
5903760	5905760	At the post office, because let's be real
5905760	5907760	That's what would usually happen
5907760	5909760	But in the interest of fairness
5909760	5911760	And we should say
5911760	5913760	Everything's okay, nobody stole it
5913760	5915760	It was recovered, that's right
5915760	5917760	They did recover the
5917760	5919760	Super Nintendo games valued at $10,000
5919760	5921760	Apparently what happened is
5921760	5923760	They were found
5923760	5925760	At an Atlanta, Georgia
5925760	5927760	Mail recovery center
5927760	5929760	So how about that, so Bobby was trying to get him redirected
5929760	5931760	To his house, no he didn't
5931760	5933760	I'm looking to see what I have
5933760	5935760	Anyway, so it was at the Atlanta, Georgia
5935760	5937760	Mail recovery center so they were able to locate the package
5937760	5939760	Here's the interesting thing
5939760	5941760	Because this was
5941760	5943760	Going around on so many news
5943760	5945760	Outlets and everything
5945760	5947760	Apparently it was giving the post office a bad rep
5947760	5949760	Right, because a lot of us were jumping
5949760	5951760	To conclusions about, oh it was stolen
5951760	5953760	So this guy was able
5953760	5955760	To get through and actually get noticed
5955760	5957760	He says in his
5957760	5959760	Little statement on what happened
5959760	5961760	He told me straight up the reason he was
5961760	5963760	Contacting me was because of the news articles
5963760	5965760	He'd encountered on the case
5965760	5967760	So thanks to the coverage, I had a strong
5967760	5969760	Contact within the US postal service
5969760	5971760	Who passed me to his employee who opened the
5971760	5973760	Investigation and then found the package
5973760	5975760	So how about that y'all, angry gamers
5975760	5977760	Accomplished something, angry
5977760	5979760	Chated fucking gamers accomplished
5979760	5981760	Something, good job
5981760	5983760	100 Nintendo, Super Nintendo
5983760	5985760	Games for you, that's more games than you'll
5985760	5987760	Find on the virtual console at launch
5987760	5989760	For the Nintendo Switch
5989760	5991760	I do think I have most of these
5991760	5993760	I love it
5993760	5995760	Loki, fuck off but I love it
5995760	5997760	Maybe that's lost somewhere
5997760	5999760	Check Atlanta
5999760	6001760	Check Bobby's house
6001760	6003760	Bobby, do you have virtual console?
6003760	6005760	Do you have virtual console in that basement?
6005760	6007760	Is that where it went?
6007760	6009760	Bobby Blackwolf
6009760	6011760	In the conservatory
6011760	6013760	With the computer hacking kit
6013760	6015760	Alright, hey
6015760	6017760	Steam prices are going up soon
6017760	6019760	Okay, just kidding
6019760	6021760	That would be the clickbait headline I would try to post
6021760	6023760	On Facebook, but it's not as bad as it sounds
6023760	6025760	Because the steam prices are not going up
6025760	6027760	In the states, so if you do come across
6027760	6029760	An article about steam prices going up soon
6029760	6031760	Here's what's really happening
6031760	6033760	Yes, sales tax is now
6033760	6035760	Included in the prices
6035760	6037760	Across new countries
6037760	6039760	There's new tax laws that are requiring sales tax
6039760	6041760	Be applied to digital goods
6041760	6043760	And services in some new countries
6043760	6045760	Starting in March in Switzerland, South Korea
6045760	6047760	Japan, New Zealand, Iceland
6047760	6049760	South Africa and India
6049760	6051760	April in Serbia, May in Taiwan
6051760	6053760	And July in Australia
6053760	6055760	So for example the tax in Australia is 10%
6055760	6057760	So in July the price of steam games
6057760	6059760	Will be 10% higher
6059760	6061760	It is going to pay for this tax
6061760	6063760	It's not like the US where you get
6063760	6065760	Charged tax after the advertised price
6065760	6067760	In these countries
6067760	6069760	For whatever reason the tax code is written
6069760	6071760	That the tax must be included in the advertised price
6071760	6073760	I guess that's like
6073760	6075760	Buying flight tickets
6075760	6077760	Here in the US
6077760	6079760	Now have to include all the other little taxes and things in them
6079760	6081760	So steam is having to do
6081760	6083760	It's alright Australia, you're used to getting screwed over
6083760	6085760	When it comes to pricing anyway
6085760	6087760	It's not nice
6087760	6089760	It is not nice
6089760	6091760	That's alright, wait for the sales
6091760	6093760	Wait for those sales
6093760	6095760	Alright, Dark Sakura, how about you?
6095760	6097760	What do you have for us?
6097760	6099760	Well a couple of things actually
6099760	6101760	That make me super happy
6101760	6103760	And one of them is a huge fuck you
6103760	6105760	So I like that even better
6105760	6107760	This one is the first happy news
6107760	6109760	One of the favorite games of my household
6109760	6111760	Actually a series I should say
6111760	6113760	Are the Wonder Boy games
6113760	6115760	That came out on Sega Master System
6115760	6117760	Well now
6117760	6119760	Dotemu has brought out
6119760	6121760	A remastered version
6121760	6123760	Of Wonder Boy 3 The Dragon's Trap
6123760	6125760	And it's just going to be called
6125760	6127760	Wonder Boy The Dragon's Trap
6127760	6129760	It has a hand drawn style
6129760	6131760	And
6131760	6133760	But it's also
6135760	6137760	Got the music
6137760	6139760	And you can swap
6139760	6141760	Between the new
6141760	6143760	Hand drawn style
6143760	6145760	And the original style
6145760	6147760	So that's really awesome
6147760	6149760	There is a whole
6149760	6151760	Trailer up and I would suggest
6151760	6153760	That people check it out, it's really sweet
6153760	6155760	Um
6155760	6157760	Next is something
6157760	6159760	That
6159760	6161760	I have to bask in this
6161760	6163760	For a minute
6163760	6165760	Humble Bundle, which by the way
6165760	6167760	I sent you a message on a bundle
6167760	6169760	I actually knew about this bundle
6169760	6171760	And I'll tell the listeners about it
6171760	6173760	Because it's the Humble Civilization Bundle
6173760	6175760	This isn't what Dark Sakura was going to talk about
6175760	6177760	But their newest bundle is the Humble Civilization Bundle
6177760	6179760	And if I remember right off the top of my head
6179760	6181760	You can pay a dollar
6181760	6183760	For a dollar
6183760	6185760	For a dollar
6185760	6187760	You guys, if you don't own
6187760	6189760	Now look, Civilization 3 is actually my least
6189760	6191760	Favorite in the entire series, I'm going to be honest
6191760	6193760	But Civ 4 is one of the best
6193760	6195760	So like if you can't be bothered
6195760	6197760	To pay one dollar
6197760	6199760	For Civilization 4
6199760	6201760	Literally, I can't
6201760	6203760	With you
6203760	6205760	But you have to also be a fan
6205760	6207760	Of those types of games
6207760	6209760	Not for a dollar, you don't really have to be a fan
6209760	6211760	If you've got a fixed income
6211760	6213760	Type of thing going on, look, I'm not going to
6213760	6215760	Break you too bad, but look, seriously, if you have the room
6215760	6217760	In your budget to forgo a soda
6217760	6219760	And buy the Civilization
6219760	6221760	Humble Bundle instead
6221760	6223760	I would encourage you to do so
6223760	6225760	As Dark Sakura takes
6225760	6227760	A big swig of her Diet Pepsi
6227760	6229760	That she probably paid a dollar fifty for at the store
6229760	6231760	And says, I don't have time for Civ 4
6231760	6233760	Actually, it tastes pretty awful
6233760	6235760	That's blood water, okay
6235760	6237760	Actually, it tastes like it
6237760	6239760	Thanks to my nose, but still
6239760	6241760	But my good news
6241760	6243760	The Humble Freedom Bundle
6243760	6245760	Raised
6245760	6247760	6.73 million
6247760	6249760	To aid
6249760	6251760	Immigrants
6251760	6253760	In response to
6253760	6255760	The new Voldemort
6255760	6257760	Immigration ban
6259760	6261760	You know what, I don't even want to call him Voldemort
6261760	6263760	Because he's fucking orange
6263760	6265760	In response to what happened
6265760	6267760	I'm just going to call him the dump
6267760	6269760	I'm just going to call him the dump
6269760	6271760	Because he's a human garbage dump
6271760	6273760	Anyway
6273760	6275760	The proceeds are going to charities like
6275760	6277760	The ACLU, the American Civil Liberties
6277760	6279760	Union, the International Rescue
6279760	6281760	Committees, and Doctors Without
6281760	6283760	Borders
6283760	6285760	Basically, it offered
6285760	6287760	Over $600
6287760	6289760	Worth of gains for $30
6289760	6291760	Including some pretty
6291760	6293760	Big ones like The Witness
6293760	6295760	And they also
6295760	6297760	Said that they would match
6297760	6299760	Up to $300,000
6299760	6301760	Of the proceeds
6301760	6303760	Totally, that's up to
6303760	6305760	6
6305760	6307760	.73 million
6307760	6309760	They did
6309760	6311760	Some of the games finally started running out
6311760	6313760	Because I'm sure some of the game makers
6313760	6315760	Hey, I think it's awesome that even the
6315760	6317760	Creator of Stardew Valley
6317760	6319760	That game is hot shit right now in the indie scene
6319760	6321760	And in the gaming scene in general
6321760	6323760	It's awesome that that guy would contribute
6323760	6325760	200,000 copies of his game
6325760	6327760	To this cause, but the reality is
6327760	6329760	He had set a number
6329760	6331760	And once they exceeded that number those keys were gone
6331760	6333760	So in the final hours
6333760	6335760	I think once they broke it was either
6335760	6337760	200,000 or 250,000, sorry I don't remember
6337760	6339760	The number, but some of the games
6339760	6341760	A good chunk of them kind of fell off the list
6341760	6343760	Like Stardew Valley I know is probably the biggest name
6343760	6345760	That no longer became available
6345760	6347760	At that point, but again
6347760	6349760	That's not a read because that's awesome
6349760	6351760	But a game like that
6351760	6353760	That's still hot shit
6353760	6355760	Getting $15 a copy is donated to a cause
6355760	6357760	Like this at all
6357760	6359760	Even more if you look at the number of keys that were available
6359760	6361760	Think of how many people
6361760	6363760	That was
6363760	6365760	Who gave a
6365760	6367760	Fuck you
6367760	6369760	To the establishment
6369760	6371760	Or just wanted to play some games
6371760	6373760	But still
6373760	6375760	It was a big fuck you
6375760	6377760	And I am so proud of them for doing this
6377760	6383760	Moving on
6383760	6385760	Alright that's it for our rapid fire news
6385760	6387760	So let's talk about
6387760	6389760	What is coming out in stores this week
6389760	6391760	Loki, gee what could possibly be coming out in the US this Friday
6391760	6393760	Horizon Zero Dawn
6393760	6395760	That's right
6395760	6397760	That's a big deal too
6397760	6399760	That is a big deal
6399760	6401760	Torment, Tides of Numeric
6401760	6403760	Isn't Horizon getting pretty good reviews too?
6403760	6405760	It is
6405760	6407760	I didn't have my eyes on it
6407760	6409760	Until I started to hear about some of these reviews
6409760	6411760	I don't always listen to reviewers
6411760	6413760	But when the feedback is uniformly positive
6413760	6415760	Like it is for this game
6415760	6417760	Or majority positive
6417760	6419760	Like it is for this game
6419760	6421760	Or like that movie
6421760	6423760	That has 100% of Rotten Tomatoes right now
6423760	6425760	That Get Out
6425760	6427760	Has 100% of Rotten Tomatoes right now
6427760	6429760	That definitely grabbed my attention
6429760	6431760	Like oh maybe this is something I should be paying attention to
6431760	6433760	And go see
6433760	6435760	Same thing kind of happens with video games
6435760	6437760	Yeah
6437760	6441760	So we had a game called Torment, Tides of Numeric
6441760	6443760	And that's on PC, Playstation 4 and Xbox One
6443760	6447760	Constructor HD on PC, Playstation 4 and Xbox One
6447760	6451760	Musou Stars on Playstation 4 and the Vita
6451760	6453760	And then of course a whole bunch of shit on the Nintendo Switch
6453760	6455760	So of course we have
6455760	6457760	1-2 Switch
6457760	6459760	I am Setsuna
6459760	6461760	Just Dance 2017
6461760	6463760	Human Resource Machine
6463760	6465760	Little Inferno, Skylanders
6465760	6467760	Imaginators, The Binding of Isaac
6467760	6469760	Afterbirth Plus
6469760	6471760	Super Bomberman R
6471760	6473760	All those on the Switch
6473760	6475760	Legend of Zelda, Breath of the Wild on the Switch
6475760	6477760	Wii U, World of Goo
6477760	6479760	On the Switch
6479760	6481760	And that would be your lineup right there
6481760	6483760	World of Goo, yes
6483760	6485760	That's not an old game
6485760	6487760	Does that game date back to the Nintendo Wii?
6487760	6489760	I think it does
6489760	6491760	It's an old game
6491760	6493760	It's like one of the first WiiWare games
6493760	6495760	Back when it was called WiiWare
6495760	6498760	Alright so moving on to Japan
6498760	6500760	And checking out what's in Japan this week
6500760	6502760	Horizon Zero Dawn gets its release on March 2nd
6502760	6505760	As well as Winning Post 8 2017
6505760	6507760	Ironically enough Loki
6507760	6511760	Borderlands, the double deluxe collection
6511760	6513760	What they're calling it in Japan
6513760	6516760	I think this might be a price reduction though
6516760	6518760	I don't think this is the initial release of the game
6518760	6520760	This is funny that we were talking about it before
6520760	6522760	And it's called the double deluxe collection
6522760	6524760	And it's very clear on the box
6524760	6526760	Borderlands the pre-sequel and Borderlands 2
6526760	6528760	Are on that
6528760	6530760	And that is on the Playstation 4 this week
6530760	6532760	Let's see traveling over to the Vita
6532760	6536760	Playstation Vita only has Winning Post 8 2017 this week
6536760	6538760	Otherwise the Vita kind of has a week off
6538760	6540760	Which believe it or not
6540760	6542760	Yes they usually have stuff going on
6542760	6544760	In Japan
6544760	6546760	Nintendo 3DS has a release this week
6546760	6548760	It's a Doraemon game
6548760	6550760	Doraemon Nobita no Nan Kyoku
6550760	6552760	Kachi Kachi Daibuken
6552760	6554760	Comes out this week
6554760	6556760	And it looks like some type of polar adventure

6692760	6694760	Yo, for the Switch
6694760	6696760	I'm gonna go hide in my room
6696760	6698760	And raid until Mass Effect
6698760	6700760	Andromeda comes out
6700760	6702760	Sounds like a plan, addict
6702760	6704760	Hey, you're the enabler
6704760	6706760	Dealer
6706760	6708760	Alright, let's go
6708760	6710760	To the mailbag
6710760	6712760	Every week you guys send us emails
6712760	6714760	Participate at
6714760	6716760	DarkSockersLoungeRadio.com
6716760	6718760	Is where you can send us emails
6718760	6720760	And when those emails come in, DarkSocker dives in the mailbag
6720760	6722760	Headfirst and reads your emails here
6722760	6724760	Live on air
6724760	6726760	So DarkSocker's gonna jump into the mailbag right now
6726760	6728760	And pull out
6728760	6730760	Jack shit
6730760	6732760	Empty mailbag
6732760	6734760	Not even a crusty poop
6734760	6736760	Why would you say that?
6736760	6738760	Because I'm a little high on cough medicine
6738760	6740760	Right now
6740760	6742760	Okay, I accept that excuse
6742760	6744760	Anyhow, there is no emails
6744760	6746760	For DarkSocker to read this week
6746760	6748760	And that makes her a sad panda
6748760	6750760	Actually, it probably doesn't since she is still kinda sick
6750760	6752760	She probably appreciates you all giving her voice a break
6752760	6754760	I'm gonna just assume
6754760	6756760	You all knew
6756760	6758760	But for next week, you can email us
6758760	6760760	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
6760760	6762760	Guess we'll have to go back to some news
6762760	6764760	Won't we, Loki?
6764760	6766760	Yep, and all the things old are new again
6766760	6768760	343Industry says
6768760	6770760	Promise? Hey, guess what?
6770760	6772760	We were briefed with Halo 5 by
6772760	6774760	Taking out split screen play
6774760	6776760	But that's not gonna be a problem going forward
6776760	6778760	We're going to go ahead
6778760	6780760	And make sure that's included
6780760	6782760	In all future releases
6782760	6784760	Because it was incredibly painful
6784760	6786760	For the community and us
6786760	6788760	That we didn't include it in Halo 5
6790760	6792760	So that's pretty nice
6792760	6794760	That'll be available
6794760	6796760	That's a staple, so why not?
6796760	6798760	Alright, so
6798760	6800760	Nice, I don't know
6800760	6802760	I guess I was kind of past it
6802760	6804760	At this point, but I'm excited
6804760	6806760	I guess a little bit to see it coming back
6806760	6808760	Because my first introduction to the Halo series
6808760	6810760	Was a split screen Halo thing
6810760	6812760	A local area network
6812760	6814760	I'm sure I've told this story on the show many times before
6814760	6816760	But it was actually at a wedding reception
6816760	6818760	My friend had a Halo themed wedding
6818760	6820760	And they actually had Halo playable
6820760	6822760	At the reception
6822760	6824760	And that was my first introduction to it
6824760	6826760	And it was awesome
6826760	6828760	It really sold me on the original Xbox
6828760	6830760	We go back to what we were talking about earlier in the show
6830760	6832760	So the split screen stuff, that's pretty cool
6832760	6834760	So I'm happy to hear it's coming back
6834760	6836760	I think that'll be a lot of fun
6836760	6838760	Alright
6838760	6840760	Well, in news of That's Awkward
6840760	6842760	This week
6842760	6844760	And where does all the awkward stuff happen?
6844760	6846760	Live streams, right?
6846760	6848760	So anyway, there was a live stream this week
6848760	6850760	Which is captured forever, thanks to YouTube
6850760	6852760	Where
6852760	6854760	I'm probably gonna say this name wrong, I'm sorry
6854760	6856760	I just don't follow a lot of the streamer celebrities
6856760	6858760	Really
6858760	6860760	But Kefri, I think is the name of the streamer
6860760	6862760	He's an Overwatch player
6862760	6864760	Plays a lot of competitive Overwatch
6864760	6866760	Plays so much competitive Overwatch
6866760	6868760	He happens to be the highest ranked Widowmaker player in the world
6868760	6870760	And Widowmaker is one of those
6870760	6872760	As I call her when I'm playing the game
6872760	6874760	Bitch snipers
6874760	6876760	Because when I get sniped
6876760	6878760	From across the map
6878760	6880760	I tend to yell out, that bitch sniper killed me
6880760	6882760	So, yeah
6882760	6884760	But I also do like playing Widowmaker a lot
6884760	6886760	Because sometimes it's really fun to be the bitch sniper
6886760	6888760	So anyway
6888760	6890760	Kefri is
6890760	6892760	The highest ranked bitch sniper in the whole world
6892760	6894760	And this was interesting
6894760	6896760	Because what happened is that he was actually
6896760	6898760	Playing the stream and doing some ranked matches
6898760	6900760	And came across
6900760	6902760	Somebody impersonating his gamer tag
6902760	6904760	So had the exact same name
6904760	6906760	In the game
6906760	6908760	Also playing Widowmaker
6908760	6910760	But as they were playing the match on Twitch
6910760	6912760	They figured, oh this guy is using an aimbot
6912760	6914760	He's cheating
6914760	6916760	He's doing these shots you can't even do
6916760	6918760	With a normal machine
6918760	6920760	Basically
6920760	6922760	Guess what?
6922760	6924760	The real player ended up winning anyway
6924760	6926760	So
6926760	6928760	Even when the guy was cheating
6928760	6930760	He couldn't beat the team
6930760	6932760	And what's really hilarious about this is you know how
6932760	6934760	One of the big things in Overwatch that's pretty awesome
6934760	6936760	Is that you always get to see play of the game
6936760	6938760	Which has become this whole meme online
6938760	6940760	So guess who got play of the game?
6940760	6942760	The real one and he even typed in chat
6942760	6944760	I think at the end when all is said and done
6944760	6946760	He said, can't even beat me with hacks bud
6946760	6948760	Laughs
6948760	6950760	You gotta love
6950760	6952760	Yes, you gotta love it
6952760	6954760	Usually that level of douchey snark
6954760	6956760	I'm like, I don't like that stuff
6956760	6958760	In the competitive scene but in this case
6958760	6960760	It is completely and utterly warranted
6960760	6962760	Fuck cheaters in online games
6962760	6964760	Fuck them with something hard and sandpapery
6964760	6966760	So this guy got what's coming to him
6966760	6968760	Embarrassed on video, it's just a bummer
6968760	6970760	We couldn't see what this guy's real
6970760	6972760	Gamer tag was
6972760	6974760	But in other words, if you're gonna go
6974760	6976760	Fake, then
6976760	6978760	You're probably gonna get beat
6978760	6980760	Kaijuto in chat says, bleh
6980760	6982760	The cheating I don't agree with
6982760	6984760	But a screen name is a screen name
6984760	6986760	There could be a hundred Kaijutos, I don't give a fuck
6988760	6990760	Yes and no
6990760	6992760	Certainly there's other people out there that must call themselves
6992760	6994760	Skye because I never get the name on websites
6994760	6996760	Which I actually usually don't try to take that name anymore
6996760	6998760	I try to get Rob Roberts wherever I can
6998760	7000760	But I digress
7000760	7002760	The fact is
7002760	7004760	That he's taking the name
7004760	7006760	And playing Widowmaker
7006760	7008760	And cheating while he's doing it
7008760	7010760	Which could be
7010760	7012760	Giving the impression that when
7012760	7014760	Other people play against him
7014760	7016760	It's the real guy
7016760	7018760	Even though it's a cheater
7018760	7020760	Does that make sense at all?
7020760	7022760	So maybe what Blizzard needs to do
7022760	7024760	And I think they actually do do this
7024760	7026760	If you mouse over the gamer tag or something
7026760	7028760	You get to see the numbers that are following the gamer tag
7028760	7030760	So you can tell if it's the right
7030760	7032760	One or not
7032760	7034760	I don't know if the professionals numbers are out there for everybody to find
7034760	7036760	But
7036760	7038760	I kinda think intent is a big part of it
7038760	7040760	And when you're using these cheating bots and so forth
7040760	7042760	To play the same character
7042760	7044760	That the hacker does with skill
7044760	7046760	Even though apparently
7046760	7048760	He's not skilled even with the hacking tool
7048760	7050760	I think that's kinda shitty
7050760	7052760	That's the whole thing
7052760	7054760	When it's like impersonation with the intent to impersonate
7054760	7056760	If it's the fact that
7056760	7058760	Oh I've been using this name for years online too
7058760	7060760	Well then that I understand
7060760	7062760	I think I went on Twitter
7062760	7064760	To try to find
7064760	7066760	I want the name Rob Roberts on Twitter
7066760	7068760	And it belongs to a spam account
7068760	7070760	But when you search for that name
7070760	7072760	You get these other Rob Roberts that come up
7072760	7074760	And I think one is like a DJ in Australia or something
7074760	7076760	I can't be mad at that guy
7076760	7078760	That just happens to be his name too
7078760	7080760	I'm not mad at that guy
7080760	7082760	I'm mad that a spammer took the name Rob Roberts
7082760	7084760	But if this other DJ had the name
7084760	7086760	Then I really couldn't be upset
7086760	7088760	Because it's his professional name too
7088760	7090760	In a different way
7090760	7092760	Anyway
7092760	7094760	Alright let's move on
7094760	7096760	DarkSakura
7096760	7100760	Well we are losing one of the writers for Portal
7100760	7102760	Very very sad
7102760	7104760	But necessary I'm sure he thinks
7104760	7106760	That it is
7106760	7108760	Paul who has been with Valve since 2004
7108760	7110760	Worked on Half Life 2 Episode 1
7110760	7112760	Both the Portal games
7112760	7114760	Left 4 Dead
7114760	7116760	Has just left the company
7118760	7120760	He didn't say anything about what's up next
7120760	7122760	But he was working with Double Fine
7122760	7124760	On Psychonauts 2
7124760	7126760	So maybe it's to spend more time on that
7126760	7128760	Only can speculate
7128760	7130760	But
7130760	7132760	Good luck and go get him
7132760	7134760	Go get him
7134760	7136760	Yeah
7136760	7138760	Hopefully he already finished the script for Portal 3
7138760	7140760	On his way out
7140760	7142760	Valve can't count to three
7142760	7144760	I'm not gonna hold my breath
7144760	7146760	We'll see
7146760	7148760	But these comings and goings happen
7148760	7150760	And series can still be strong
7150760	7152760	Casey Hudson left BioWare
7152760	7154760	And now Mass Effect is being done by other people
7154760	7156760	Which
7156760	7158760	We won't really know if the story
7158760	7160760	Is still good until Mass Effect Andromeda
7160760	7162760	Is out we get a chance to play it
7162760	7164760	But we're hopeful
7164760	7166760	Did you see the voice list?
7166760	7168760	I did and I also saw the
7168760	7170760	Andromeda t-shirt that was on sale
7170760	7172760	At Gamestop when I was at the mall
7172760	7174760	So I was like oh the merchandise is out already
7174760	7176760	I was also listening to
7176760	7178760	Some of Natalie Dormer
7178760	7180760	I heard the little interview with her
7180760	7182760	It was pretty neat
7182760	7184760	Very excited for the game to come out
7184760	7186760	I can't wait to fuck all the aliens
7186760	7188760	Alright moving on
7188760	7190760	Loki
7190760	7192760	The question is is Natalie Dormer one of the aliens
7192760	7194760	He can fuck because you know
7194760	7196760	She's the doctor
7196760	7198760	Oh she's the chakwas replacement
7198760	7200760	Yes she is the asari doctor
7200760	7202760	I don't need to know what the profession is
7202760	7204760	That's not really important
7204760	7206760	No this is important because Dr. Chakwas is like
7206760	7208760	She's mom
7208760	7210760	She is the den mother mom of the Normandy
7210760	7212760	She's very much like you know
7212760	7214760	Like Kathleen Turner
7214760	7216760	Like you know
7216760	7218760	Why don't you come into my office and we'll
7218760	7220760	Drink a glass of champagne
7220760	7222760	So uh
7222760	7224760	The doctor is a pretty big role
7224760	7226760	Alright
7226760	7228760	Well um
7228760	7230760	Let's talk a little bit about
7230760	7232760	Esports I guess so
7232760	7234760	One thing
7234760	7236760	Is coming to TV pretty soon
7236760	7238760	In the weirdest locations I guess
7238760	7240760	The CW network
7240760	7242760	Yes that's who you think of
7242760	7244760	They're going to be broadcasting
7244760	7246760	I guess a tournament for
7246760	7248760	H1Z1 king of the kill
7248760	7250760	And so with that
7250760	7252760	Along with the actual broadcast
7252760	7254760	Which is supposed to air April 20th
7254760	7256760	At 9pm eastern time
7256760	7258760	They're going to be doing also a 5 part documentary
7258760	7260760	Series leading up to the tournament
7260760	7262760	And it's going to follow the um
7262760	7264760	Prematch preparations
7264760	7266760	Of Echo Fox
7266760	7268760	The um professional esports team
7268760	7270760	They got rid of top model for that
7270760	7272760	What the fuck
7272760	7274760	I've actually watched
7274760	7276760	A little bit of king of the kill
7276760	7278760	It's actually pretty interesting
7278760	7280760	Since I'm sure you guys are probably not familiar with it
7280760	7282760	It's basically like DayZ
7282760	7284760	But put into um
7284760	7286760	It almost like gets a little bit like
7286760	7288760	Um
7288760	7290760	Um
7290760	7292760	Not the Hunger Games
7292760	7294760	Sort of like the Hunger Games I guess
7294760	7296760	So basically you're in this environment
7296760	7298760	You land and you have to find your guns
7298760	7300760	And then there's like gas coming in
7300760	7302760	As well and it keeps making the
7302760	7304760	Arena smaller and smaller and smaller
7304760	7306760	So they're setting it up they're going to have
7306760	7308760	5 man teams
7308760	7310760	And there's 15 teams of 5 players
7310760	7312760	And then there's also supposed to be I guess another um
7312760	7314760	You know some open slots for
7314760	7316760	Individual people as well
7316760	7318760	But it's a lot of people that start off
7318760	7320760	In the game
7320760	7322760	I don't know it was entertaining why I watched it
7322760	7324760	I'll have to check it out
7324760	7326760	Is this a regular thing on Twitch
7326760	7328760	I assume that people are playing?
7328760	7330760	Yes it's one of the bigger games it's on Twitch right now
7330760	7332760	Okay awesome I'll have to check that out
7332760	7334760	I can take a break from Conan Exile streams
7334760	7336760	Check that out
7336760	7338760	So is that just all penis flailing to me?
7338760	7340760	Yes never gets old
7340760	7342760	Actually that game has died down in popularity a lot
7342760	7344760	I think finally everybody is like alright it's a penis
7344760	7346760	We get it
7346760	7348760	I think Conan Exile streams have died down
7348760	7350760	A little bit in popularity
7350760	7352760	Has Conan played Conan Exiles because
7352760	7354760	I don't know
7354760	7356760	Well he's gonna have that series soon
7356760	7358760	The clueless gamer
7358760	7360760	Or whatever he calls it
7360760	7362760	Is that on the CW?
7362760	7364760	No that would be probably on
7364760	7366760	Was it TBS?
7366760	7368760	Actually CW has a lot of those serial
7368760	7370760	Shows now right?
7370760	7372760	Supernatural is fucking still going
7372760	7374760	And it's still awesome
7374760	7376760	All these years later
7376760	7378760	All the DC shows are there
7378760	7380760	Supergirl is moving there right?
7380760	7382760	I'm so far behind
7382760	7384760	On all that stuff
7384760	7386760	I have to ask John from
7386760	7388760	Critical Myth because he still follows
7388760	7390760	All those shows and they write some great reviews
7390760	7392760	Over at VOG Network but I admittedly
7392760	7394760	Don't follow a lot of them
7394760	7396760	However I will say this
7396760	7398760	Dark Soccer maybe this is something you know about this
7398760	7400760	I realize this has nothing to do with games but it's very
7400760	7402760	Important
7402760	7404760	Can somebody explain to me why
7404760	7406760	Riverdale is so popular
7406760	7408760	I haven't watched it
7408760	7410760	It sounds kind of amazing
7410760	7412760	When I first heard about Riverdale I was like
7412760	7414760	Oh they're turning Archie from the comics
7414760	7416760	Into one of these shows that's gonna be a little ridiculous
7416760	7418760	But apparently it's like
7418760	7420760	Archie but like if all those characters
7420760	7422760	Were in Twin Peaks
7422760	7424760	What? Yeah that's what Riverdale
7424760	7426760	Is
7426760	7428760	It's like the dark version of
7428760	7430760	Archie
7430760	7432760	And it's all the same people like Veronica
7432760	7434760	Fucking Josie from Josie and the Pussycats
7434760	7436760	Is there too like it's yeah right?
7436760	7438760	That's the same face timing
7438760	7440760	They decided
7440760	7442760	We're gonna take
7442760	7444760	We're gonna take Batman
7444760	7446760	And make it dark
7446760	7448760	Is that Happily Ever After?
7448760	7450760	Or something like that?
7450760	7452760	What's that show that's with all the Disney
7452760	7454760	Oh Once Upon a Time
7454760	7456760	Once Upon a Time is that like
7456760	7458760	Once Upon a Time but in the Archie universe now?
7458760	7460760	Yes
7460760	7462760	Something like that I don't know
7462760	7464760	But apparently everybody I've seen on the Twitters
7464760	7466760	And all the stuff like Tumblr
7466760	7468760	They're putting shit up like there's
7468760	7470760	Gifts everywhere
7470760	7472760	And everything so I don't know
7472760	7474760	I feel like it's one of those shows I need to be
7474760	7476760	Seeing let's see I'm looking in chat
7476760	7478760	Over at live.vognetwork.com
7478760	7480760	Come on Noel Gus says Riverdale is pretty good
7480760	7482760	Brad from Pod Culture says
7482760	7484760	Supergirl is there I follow
7484760	7486760	All of them love Legends of Tomorrow
7486760	7488760	I know they started putting some of that on
7488760	7490760	Netflix so
7490760	7492760	I tried to see if Riverdale
7492760	7494760	If I ever stop hating on DC maybe I'll give them a chance
7494760	7496760	One of these days but no thanks
7496760	7498760	Where can I watch Riverdale online?
7498760	7500760	I would totally watch it
7500760	7502760	But it's not on Netflix
7502760	7504760	New shows usually aren't
7504760	7506760	Hulu I've been using
7506760	7508760	I have a friend that I may or may not
7508760	7510760	Be borrowing their Hulu account
7510760	7512760	So I can watch Golden Girls
7512760	7514760	And I tried to see I was like
7514760	7516760	Oh maybe usually that type of stuff shows up there
7516760	7518760	But there's no Riverdale on Hulu either
7518760	7520760	But that's fine because I still have like
7520760	7522760	160 episodes of Golden Girls left to watch
7522760	7524760	Thank you a couple weekends
7524760	7526760	It will take me a little while
7526760	7528760	Maybe by then you know the new season of
7528760	7530760	Stranger Things will be out so
7530760	7532760	Oh there's a CW app that's apparently
7532760	7534760	totally free
7534760	7536760	Like on
7536760	7538760	Playstation or Xbox
7538760	7540760	The Android TV
7540760	7542760	The Play Store has that and I'm like
7542760	7544760	Oh CW what the hell do I need this for
7544760	7546760	Maybe they have
7546760	7548760	Because my fucking TV has apps
7548760	7550760	So maybe it's like a Samsung TV
7550760	7552760	Because Netflix is built into my TV
7552760	7554760	So maybe they have that
7554760	7556760	I'm going to look for that stuff
7556760	7558760	Oh Rama says Comcast on Demand
7558760	7560760	Thank you Rama
7560760	7562760	I have Comcast on Demand
7562760	7564760	I never use it but I will check out this show
7564760	7566760	Because I'm very curious
7566760	7568760	I have a purpose now for Comcast on Demand
7568760	7570760	Alright
7570760	7572760	DarkSakura why are you telling people to fight you in chat
7572760	7574760	What are you doing
7574760	7576760	Shots have been fired
7576760	7578760	Why what was fired
7578760	7580760	Brad says that DC is better than Marvel
7580760	7582760	for TV and I'm like
7582760	7584760	Marvel is better than DC for everything
7584760	7586760	Brad's been saying that you two
7586760	7588760	go back and forth on the DC and
7588760	7590760	Marvel thing for forever
7590760	7592760	I haven't watched really any of them so I can't make a judgement
7592760	7594760	at this point
7594760	7596760	I think you and Brad need to do a podcast
7596760	7598760	together called Fight Me
7598760	7600760	and it's just a DC
7600760	7602760	Marvel wank fest every week
7602760	7604760	I don't even like DC enough to entertain
7604760	7606760	that it might be good
7606760	7608760	You're such a bitch
7608760	7610760	and I love it
7610760	7612760	I like Suicide Squad
7612760	7614760	Because you know what
7614760	7616760	it wasn't quite like they were in the comics
7616760	7618760	Actually I'll tell you this right now
7618760	7620760	I have gone back to buying physical comic books
7620760	7622760	again because of one fucking series
7622760	7624760	I now have a new
7624760	7626760	series of Jessica Jones
7626760	7628760	in comics
7628760	7630760	just focused on her
7630760	7632760	in the actual comic universe and not the TV universe
7632760	7634760	and it's perfect
7634760	7636760	Here's the thing
7636760	7638760	Dark Soccer and I know you're going to plug your ears and say
7638760	7640760	la la la but I'm going to try anyway
7640760	7642760	You should give
7642760	7644760	if you're going to give any of this shit a chance
7644760	7646760	try Supergirl
7646760	7648760	Everything I've heard about that show
7648760	7650760	I feel like you might dig it
7650760	7652760	Okay I will admit this
7652760	7654760	I do have Supergirl on DVD
7654760	7656760	because I fucking love that movie as a kid
7656760	7658760	I'm not even talking about the fucking movie
7658760	7660760	But
7660760	7662760	But
7662760	7664760	I have considered
7664760	7666760	giving the TV show a try
7666760	7668760	because of my love for the old movie
7668760	7670760	There you go and the old movie is not even
7670760	7672760	that good you guys
7672760	7674760	I don't fucking care because it has
7674760	7676760	Faye Dunaway in it as the bad guy
7676760	7678760	I just want to remind you all this chick stands
7678760	7680760	for Xanadu
7680760	7682760	I love Xanadu
7682760	7684760	You shut up about Xanadu because you know what
7684760	7686760	Don Bluth
7686760	7688760	In the studios took time out of their
7688760	7690760	busy schedule producing
7690760	7692760	The Secret of Nim
7692760	7694760	No no The Secret of Nim at the time
7694760	7696760	to do Xanadu
7696760	7698760	to do that one little bit in Xanadu
7698760	7700760	and almost delayed the release of
7700760	7702760	The Secret of Nim which is also
7702760	7704760	one of my other favorite fucking movies of all time so don't judge me
7704760	7706760	I will fight everyone
7706760	7708760	Here's Brad from Pod Culture with the
7708760	7710760	selling line
7710760	7712760	The chick from the original movie plays
7712760	7714760	Supergirl's adopted mom on the show
7714760	7716760	I sold
7716760	7718760	Oh fuck
7718760	7720760	I know her name
7720760	7722760	Helen something
7722760	7724760	How did I know that?
7724760	7726760	How did I know that?
7726760	7728760	You know what else she was in?
7728760	7730760	She was in The Legend of Billie Jean
7730760	7732760	I feel like I had to tap into gay superpowers
7732760	7734760	to remember that
7734760	7736760	We just have a knack for pop culture
7736760	7738760	The Legend of Billie Jean was also a great movie
7738760	7740760	Alright
7740760	7742760	Moving on
7742760	7744760	Let's talk about
7744760	7746760	Let's talk about an awesome series on the Atari 2600
7746760	7748760	that you may or may not have ever played
7748760	7750760	It's Sword Quest
7750760	7752760	Did you ever play these Sword Quest games?
7752760	7754760	They were kind of hard to understand
7754760	7756760	especially at a young age that I was
7756760	7758760	when these games first came out
7758760	7760760	They were kind of like a bunch of mini games
7760760	7762760	but they all came together for this larger purpose
7762760	7764760	of you were trying to look for
7764760	7766760	items and traverse the kingdom
7766760	7768760	and all this stuff
7768760	7770760	1982 was when the first game in the series
7770760	7772760	came out it was Earthworld
7772760	7774760	and then finally Fireworld
7774760	7776760	came out in 1983
7776760	7778760	and 1983 unfortunately
7778760	7780760	is when the video game industry went
7780760	7782760	so the series was never really finished
7782760	7784760	Waterworld
7784760	7786760	did I think get released
7786760	7788760	really limitedly
7788760	7790760	through Club Atari and I think you can
7790760	7792760	get it on some of the flashback stuff
7792760	7794760	now and then Airworld
7794760	7796760	which was supposed to be the last game was never made
7796760	7798760	and the interesting thing about this series is that
7798760	7800760	there was a prize like it was supposed to be like
7800760	7802760	if you were the first person to crack the code
7802760	7804760	you got this prize thing
7804760	7806760	that was worth like a quarter million dollars
7806760	7808760	which in the 80's was a lot more
7808760	7810760	money than it is today and so it was like
7810760	7812760	a lot of money but they never ended up having to
7812760	7814760	give the thing away because they never really
7814760	7816760	finished the series. Here's what's interesting
7816760	7818760	Dynamite Entertainment has picked up
7818760	7820760	the rights to Sword Quest they are
7820760	7822760	going to launch a comic book series
7822760	7824760	beginning in May
7824760	7826760	to actually finish
7826760	7828760	the story of Sword Quest
7828760	7830760	which Atari 2600 games
7830760	7832760	didn't have much story
7832760	7834760	I seem to remember these games
7834760	7836760	I think were like comic book style manuals
7836760	7838760	of their own that told a story
7838760	7840760	so it's interesting that it's all
7840760	7842760	coming back so that's cool
7842760	7844760	the creative team
7844760	7846760	behind Sword Quest is going to be
7846760	7848760	Chris Simms who wrote Marvel's
7848760	7850760	X-Men 92 series
7850760	7852760	and artist Scott
7852760	7854760	Kolichuk who did Batman
7854760	7856760	66 for a bit
7856760	7858760	so that's pretty cool so check that
7858760	7860760	out because who knows if the Sword
7860760	7862760	Quest comic does well maybe it
7862760	7864760	will become a video game movie that doesn't
7864760	7866760	suck we'll see

8006760	8008760	you had like
8008760	8010760	one thing that got a million notes
8010760	8012760	or something and you were like I should exploit this
8012760	8014760	for an entire blog
8014760	8016760	I was looking at one of my screen caps
8016760	8018760	and it's one of the Turian characters cross eyed
8018760	8020760	so I just wrote
8020760	8022760	derpians under it and posted it on my blog
8022760	8024760	because I thought it was funny
8024760	8026760	cause that's what fucking happens on tumblr
8026760	8028760	outside of the pornography
8028760	8030760	I did have to do a little research cause I knew there was tons of porn
8030760	8032760	on tumblr I mean hello
8032760	8034760	but if you actually like did like what is tumblr
8034760	8036760	really supposed to be for
8036760	8038760	like what they told yahoo to buy it for
8038760	8040760	is just random
8040760	8042760	shit like what just dark soccer explained
8042760	8044760	for the most part it is just random shit
8044760	8046760	it's memes
8046760	8048760	dank fucking memes
8048760	8050760	but like I went from doing like one or so a week
8050760	8052760	to now doing one every fucking day
8052760	8054760	to the point that I have managed to get
8054760	8056760	out of doing two days worth of them
8056760	8058760	by having a blank
8058760	8060760	one go up as a caption contest
8060760	8062760	and picking the winner at the end of the week

8464760	8466760	William Ritterface says loki has to dress as tingle
8466760	8468760	well that won't happen but maybe
8468760	8470760	we could get him to play the tingle
8470760	8472760	game on 3DS or something
8472760	8474760	you don't have a problem playing a game with tingle in it
8474760	8476760	yeah it's a little
8476760	8478760	I like to force him to work on his game
8478760	8480760	they should do a new game called tickle my tingle
8480760	8482760	hi you're on orange solids radio who's this
8482760	8484760	this is ron man I want to give a giant
8484760	8486760	fuck you to skype tonight ok
8486760	8488760	yeah you sound like you're like I feel like
8488760	8490760	your skype is on one side of the room
8490760	8492760	and you're on the other side of the room yelling
8492760	8494760	at it
8494760	8496760	here's the thing I went out and decided
8496760	8498760	to update one of the
8498760	8500760	usb adapters I do my podcast
8500760	8502760	with and I already set the settings
8502760	8504760	for the secondary device
8504760	8506760	for music
8506760	8508760	skype doesn't pay attention so
8508760	8510760	when the call picked up I'm like
8510760	8512760	it's coming through the headphones grab the headphones
8512760	8514760	I don't hear shit what the fuck is going on check the settings
8514760	8516760	coming through external sound blaster
8516760	8518760	I wasn't going to tell everybody you were that
8518760	8520760	fail call a minute ago but if you're going to
8520760	8522760	out yourself as that then fine
8522760	8524760	I have no problem owning up to that
8524760	8526760	I really don't because in between
8526760	8528760	that the fact that
8528760	8530760	I am missing half a carpet in my apartment
8530760	8532760	and the fact that I went IKEA shopping for
8532760	8534760	new furniture has been quite a week
8534760	8536760	alright what's on your mind
8536760	8538760	tonight Rama besides anger
8538760	8540760	two things I want to agree
8540760	8542760	with you on Cards Against Humanity
8542760	8544760	I have to when I go
8544760	8546760	out to conventions and certain events
8546760	8548760	I have to go through
8548760	8550760	my decks and take out certain
8550760	8552760	expansion packs so that people
8552760	8554760	do not get confused
8554760	8556760	oddly enough everyone who plays
8556760	8558760	this game are die hard gamers
8558760	8560760	geeks and nerds yes you probably
8560760	8562760	have like anime expansions
8562760	8564760	that if you tried to play with me I'd be like
8564760	8566760	I this sounds like it
8566760	8568760	might be funny actually
8568760	8570760	no the most you probably get
8570760	8572760	confused with is the Cards Against
8572760	8574760	New York Cards Against Brooklyn expansion
8574760	8576760	packs but you will pick up on that pretty
8576760	8578760	quick I think that I could
8578760	8580760	probably figure out I watch
8580760	8582760	enough cop shows
8582760	8584760	yeah I can kind of agree with that
8584760	8586760	what's the other thing
8586760	8588760	alright I'm coming I'm listening
8588760	8590760	to the shows which is why I was kind of late
8590760	8592760	getting the classic game in a week
8592760	8594760	up I want to give a shout out
8594760	8596760	to Jamie
8596760	8598760	ah the switch
8598760	8600760	the switch
8600760	8602760	I think we're probably the only
8602760	8604760	two that get that
8604760	8606760	when you said when you said
8606760	8608760	that somebody have to go out in the back
8608760	8610760	oh yeah
8610760	8612760	yes I've told
8612760	8614760	friends of mine stories of me
8614760	8616760	go out and get the switch
8616760	8618760	now you try to be a smart ass
8618760	8620760	and get like the smallest switch possible
8620760	8622760	and you think that oh
8622760	8624760	this will be an easy beating no
8624760	8626760	your mom still or your grandmother finds a way
8626760	8628760	to take this little switch
8628760	8630760	give you a sound beating and send you
8630760	8632760	back outside for a regulation size one
8632760	8634760	for round two oh no no no no
8634760	8636760	it was always you had to get something that
8636760	8638760	was right in between
8638760	8640760	the really
8640760	8642760	thin ones or a log
8644760	8646760	I'm going to have to be right in the middle of that
8646760	8648760	a switch is just the southern
8648760	8650760	version of the belt
8650760	8652760	or la chancla right
8654760	8656760	the switch is literally you go
8656760	8658760	and you find the camellia bush in your backyard
8658760	8660760	you pick it off
8660760	8662760	you pick all the leaves off of it
8662760	8664760	and you pray that you've gotten all the little
8664760	8666760	nubby bits too
8666760	8668760	see I didn't have that
8668760	8670760	where I lived they were
8670760	8672760	yellow honeysuckle
8672760	8674760	branches and bushes growing
8674760	8676760	that's where I had to pick it from
8678760	8680760	it was either camellias or azaleas
8680760	8682760	azaleas or camellias
8682760	8684760	and for the record
8684760	8686760	la chancla is the thong
8686760	8688760	shoes that when you piss
8688760	8690760	mom off she's going to take off her chancla
8690760	8692760	and beat you with it yeah
8692760	8694760	there is a shirt that says I survived la chancla
8694760	8696760	but we never used footwear because footwear
8696760	8698760	in the south is all cowboy boots that would murder a child
8700760	8702760	this murders the child
8704760	8706760	alright
8706760	8708760	you just want to make them wish they were dead
8708760	8710760	rama anything else you want to share with us tonight
8710760	8712760	I ran
8712760	8714760	the two japanese girls on the train
8714760	8716760	and they were amused by
8716760	8718760	my wireless
8718760	8720760	headphones because you have custom
8720760	8722760	ear pads on them mine has the
8722760	8724760	one half logo on them they found it quite cute
8724760	8726760	I have not seen
8726760	8728760	these headphones I bet it was adorable
8728760	8730760	if you go to vmoda and you get
8730760	8732760	the wireless crossfades you can get
8732760	8734760	custom 2d and 3d engraving
8734760	8736760	only in new york
8736760	8738760	no this is anywhere really

8880760	8882760	usuals tonight I'm gonna do something on wii u

8900760	8902760	I was about to buy one I'm sure he would be
8902760	8904760	thrilled if you used it cos it'll
8904760	8906760	work well with garage band cos Dan
8906760	8908760	and I are talking about doing

8926760	8928760	virtual console I just haven't decided yet
8928760	8930760	so you know it is on virtual console I started
8930760	8932760	and it already annoyed me hmm
8932760	8934760	mother oh yeah like the
8934760	8936760	the old school earthbound zero yeah
8936760	8938760	yeah it's it's worth it how did it
8938760	8940760	annoy you it's just like some

8942760	8944760	right at the start of the game it was a different day

8946760	8948760	all right well nobody
8948760	8950760	else is calling on the skype line so I guess that's gonna do it
8950760	8952760	for calls tonight I know a lot of our
8952760	8954760	usual live crowd is probably distracted
8954760	8956760	by the oscars are they over yet
8956760	8958760	it's almost god it's almost midnight on the
8958760	8960760	east coast they've gotta be over apparently

8966760	8968760	did the did uh ask to find a picture
8968760	8970760	of it now I'm assuming La La Land
8970760	8972760	won best picture I mean it got
8972760	8974760	all those nominations god I hope not it's a
8974760	8976760	fucking movie about Hollywood
8976760	8978760	being in love with itself that's
8978760	8980760	what are the oscars dark

8982760	8984760	uh pretty godson there was hidden
8984760	8986760	figures you know there's
8986760	8988760	much better movies I haven't
8988760	8990760	I the lat okay the last movie
8990760	8992760	I saw in the theaters was warcraft
8992760	8994760	so I haven't seen any of these movies so I
8994760	8996760	have no doctor strange I have no opinion
8996760	8998760	but before that it was warcraft um
8998760	9000760	I want to see
9000760	9002760	beauty and the beast because
9002760	9004760	that is my favorite
9004760	9006760	Disney movie do you know

9030760	9032760	director for La La Land won
9032760	9034760	what the fuck ever and usually usually
9034760	9036760	the director and the picture are the same thing actually
9036760	9038760	not all the past couple years that trend's been
9038760	9040760	broken I think they've they've split
