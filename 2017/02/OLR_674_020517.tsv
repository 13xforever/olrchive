0	27000	This week, celebrate naked pixel bodies with the Early Access release of Conan Exiles and a PlayStation VR bug in Dead or Alive Xtreme 3. There's plenty more safe-for-work news to share and it all starts right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
28000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	53000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight, episode number 674 for this February the 5th of 2017. My name is Rob Roberts and joining me in studio as always, welcome back, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
53000	54000	Hi.
54000	55000	Hi, how are you?
55000	56000	I'm rude.
56000	60000	You're rude. Yes, you are rude and hateful and all those things.
60000	62000	Rude, crude and unattractive.
62000	67000	No, you're actually nice. It's a front that she puts on everybody.
67000	68000	I'm a bitch.
68000	70000	Being in total control of herself.
70000	71000	Yes.
71000	72000	Yes.
72000	73000	Yes.
73000	76000	Or like that song in the 90s. Do kids today remember that song? I'm a bitch.
76000	78000	I hate that song so much.
78000	79000	Really?
79000	82000	Like I hate that song and I hate the What If God Was One of Us song.
82000	84000	I actually, I, okay, you want to hear?
84000	86000	I hate the Blind Melon song too, rest in peace.
86000	88000	What? I love that song.
88000	89000	I don't.
89000	90000	Okay, now you are rude. Never mind.
90000	91000	Damn.
91000	93000	We're not talking to you anymore. Say hello to Tech Master, Loki.
93000	94000	Hi.
94000	95000	Hi, Loki. How are you?
95000	96000	I'm fine.
96000	97000	Do you like Blind Melons, No Rain?
97000	98000	It's okay.
98000	101000	Alright, you can stay. Alright, how have you been though? How was your week?
101000	105000	I was filled with spending time with the kids.
105000	106000	That's good.
106000	107000	Eh.
107000	108000	Don't worry.
108000	113000	You're kind of over it. You want him to be 18 already?
114000	119000	Also say hello to our chat room. Those of you guys that join us every week.
119000	122000	Live, Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
122000	125000	Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, although not tonight.
125000	128000	There's this other event that people seem to care about.
128000	132000	I mean like Lady Gaga put on a concert and the whole world had to stop.
132000	134000	But to be fair, it was a really good concert.
134000	135000	I know, right?
135000	136000	Yeah.
136000	137000	That was the best 13 minutes of my life.
137000	138000	It was pretty good.
138000	141000	Meanwhile, there's birds murdering some patriots in Houston.
141000	142000	I don't know what's going on.
142000	144000	But anyway, I guess that is continuing.
144000	148000	People who make more than small countries bring in.
148000	152000	Bobby was off somewhere tonight beating a drum in response to.
152000	155000	His hand will probably fall off with all the touchdowns going on.
155000	157000	So is it Superb Al Birdemic 3?
157000	160000	That's right. Yes, Superb Al Birdemic 3. I love it.
160000	165000	But anyway, hi chatters over at live.vognetwork.com.
165000	170000	Let's see, AkumaJP tuning in tonight all the way from Japan saying,
170000	174000	Almost forgot it's Monday. Almost break my OLR cycle.
174000	175000	That's right. It's Monday morning in Japan.
175000	178000	Good morning, AkumaJP. Hope you're doing well over there.
178000	180000	Enrageinator telling DarkSakura how it is.
180000	183000	No rain by Blind Melon is fucking awesome, DarkSakura.
183000	184000	You tell her. You tell her.
184000	187000	Anyway, we are here to talk about, of course, video games,
187000	191000	gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle over the next about three hours or so.
191000	192000	Or until we're done.
192000	195000	That's how long this show is. Until we're done.
195000	199000	We weren't here last week and I just want to say sorry about that.
199000	201000	Because usually we try to give you guys like a lot of notice,
201000	206000	especially because I know like AkumaJP or the other folks in our chat right now,
206000	211000	folks will make time in their schedule to be here live to participate with the show
211000	214000	and maybe call in and have their chat comments read and so forth.
214000	217000	So last week we had to cancel at the last minute.
217000	220000	I was sick, y'all. There's just really nothing to do about it.
220000	222000	Had a really nasty sinus thing going on.
222000	225000	And it was one of those things was like there was no way I was going to be able to talk for three hours.
225000	228000	I know y'all understand, but still I still I feel bad about it.
228000	232000	And then my co-hosts don't want to be anywhere near me because they don't want to get sick.
232000	233000	That's all right. The kids were all sick.
233000	234000	I came by anyway.
234000	237000	I was like, actually, yeah, Jamie came by for a minute anyway.
237000	239000	I thought about doing mini-OLR.
239000	240000	I brought you coffee.
240000	243000	But yeah, she brought me coffee and other hot drinks to make me feel better.
243000	245000	And, Loki, your kids were sick anyway.
245000	249000	Yeah, they're still sick and my wife's sick and I'm fine for right now.
249000	250000	For right now.
250000	254000	Until it's set to inconvenience me the most, which will probably be in a couple days.
255000	258000	Yeah, there still may be germs laying around the house, so be careful.
258000	262000	But the good news is if you need something to sterilize the germs,
262000	266000	I have this lovely wine that I picked up yesterday that has alcohol in it.
266000	267000	And alcohol kills germs.
267000	269000	So that's why you should drink some of it.
269000	274000	Anyway, let's get into some gaming news to start off this week.
274000	276000	Let's catch up on some things we missed last week.
276000	279000	We have some stories from last week peppered throughout the show.
279000	280000	Some big stuff that came up.
280000	283000	But I thought we'd start with one tonight about what's going on with Xbox One.
283000	289000	I mean, we start off a lot of shows lately, anyway, talking about the Switch and what's going on there.
289000	291000	We have some big PS4 stuff coming up.
291000	295000	But we don't show the Xbox One enough love here on the show, so here we go.
295000	297000	Going to open with an Xbox One story tonight.
297000	300000	Although, maybe this isn't love, I don't know.
300000	302000	I want to know what you guys feel about this.
302000	308000	Snap Mode officially confirmed that Snap Mode will be going away this week.
308000	314000	Soon, sorry, it was confirmed this past week, that Xbox One's Snap feature will be going away.
314000	321000	And I believe some people are starting to see it as part of this update that they get with the beta program and so forth.
321000	326000	There's a tweet out there from Mike Ybarra from Xbox who says,
326000	336000	We replaced Snap to improve multitasking, reduce memory use, improve overall speed, and free up resources going forward for bigger things.
336000	337000	What could that be?
337000	344000	Anyhow, Snap Mode, if you don't have an Xbox One or you weren't using it, it was a big thing when Kinect was around
344000	348000	because you could literally use your hands to snap things, although they replaced it with controller features.
348000	355000	And it was a way that you could watch TV while you were actually, that's why they had the TV bypass on the Xbox One.
355000	360000	So you could actually watch TV in the corner, like in a small corner, while you are playing a video game, so you can multitask.
360000	368000	But another big feature that I know some people are going to feel the pain of a little bit is that some folks were using it for Twitch.
368000	376000	And by snapping Twitch to the side of the screen, you could stream your game via Twitch and see your chat comments.
376000	382000	Now you'll still be able to stream via Twitch, that's not going away, it's just going to run in the background, kind of like I guess the PlayStation 4 does it.
382000	391000	But the PlayStation 4 is set up differently because Sony kind of built in that screen thing into their firmware basically.
391000	397000	Which I would love to see that even more customizable, but I'm getting on a tangent there, this is about Microsoft.
397000	403000	So you're not going to be able to see the chat comments anymore because Snap isn't going to work the same way.
403000	411000	Now to be fair, Microsoft or Twitch may release an updated version of this that would allow something similar to what we see on Sony's system.
411000	417000	Where you can kind of flip back and forth between modes where the chat is built in and so forth.
417000	421000	But for right now, with this, you're not going to be able to see chat when you do Twitch.
421000	427000	Unless of course, you do a second screen. I know I've done that when I've done streaming on PlayStation 4.
427000	430000	I mean I don't stream a lot a lot, but I have done streaming from PlayStation 4.
430000	433000	I distinctly remember I did a No Man's Sky stream when that game first came out.
433000	438000	And because that game has really, you know, graphics were a big selling point of that game.
438000	442000	I wanted to do full screen with no camera or anything, just me kind of messing around.
442000	445000	And so what I did is I did chat comments on my iPad.
445000	447000	So I used like a second screen to be able to see comments.
447000	450000	But I realize not everybody certainly has that ability.
450000	453000	So those are just some of the features that Snap mode had.
453000	456000	There's also the music player and so on.
456000	462000	So I'm just curious what you guys think about Snap mode going away.
462000	464000	Is that a good thing? Is that a bad thing?
464000	469000	I don't know. But I know my co-host here in studio, neither one of you own an Xbox One, right?
469000	470000	No, I don't.
470000	473000	So it's not like you really had a chance to use this anyway.
473000	475000	I wouldn't have used it probably anyway.
475000	476000	But what you're hearing about it, what do you think?
476000	480000	I just don't think that was very utilized and so it's not a big deal.
480000	482000	And they'll have something to replace it, so who cares?
482000	485000	What do you mean by something to replace it? Do you think-
485000	490000	Well, they said in the comment that they have something that's going to be replacing it for multitasking and stuff.
490000	491000	I see.
491000	494000	Maybe they'll have something that works better than that.
494000	501000	The new alt-tab feature to bring your Windows 10 and your Xbox One experience closer together.
501000	507000	Well, they still don't have those universal apps yet, aside from some of the games and stuff.
507000	508000	Yeah, some of the games.
508000	513000	But they don't have a lot of the app stuff available.
513000	518000	It's supposed to be, oh, hey, you developed it for the Windows 10 marketplace and there you go.
518000	521000	You can run it on your Xbox One or something.
521000	525000	Would I be able to run PowerPoints on my Xbox One? That might be something.
525000	530000	I'm not sure why I would ever do that, but I'd just like to know that I can. Who knows?
530000	537000	Tigerclaw in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says they are removing Snap to boost system performance.
537000	541000	They should have researched that when they were working on it.
541000	546000	And let's see, AkumaJP in chat says, what is this one thing you guys are talking about?
546000	549000	I'm not sure it exists in Japan, AkumaJP.
549000	554000	If it does, you might have to ask at the electronics store and it might be in the back.
554000	557000	There might be one in a closet somewhere.
557000	560000	Like, check next to the cleaning supplies.
560000	564000	That might be where the Xboxes are in Japan. I don't know.
564000	571000	Kaijuto also in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, I've never even heard of Snap mode. What is that?
571000	572000	Well, hopefully we explained it a little bit for you.
572000	580000	But it was supposed to be one of the features that put the Xbox One, you know, it was supposed to make it more attractive compared to its competition.
580000	587000	Skype is another one. I want to say that YYR called this show using Skype on his Xbox One.
587000	591000	He was probably using the Snap feature to do it. I don't want to put words in his mouth.
591000	596000	But I'm pretty sure that is something you can do is you can Skype on Xbox One's Snap as well.
597000	600000	Which is a pretty good way to be able to video chat and all this stuff.
600000	605000	Which, you know, you can't even really do on the Wii U even though it has this whole second screen.
605000	606000	Well, it's okay though.
606000	608000	Yes, you can video chat but not while playing a game.
608000	613000	It's okay. You can't really video chat on the Xbox One anyways because they don't sell the Kinect cameras with it anymore.
613000	614000	That's true.
614000	621000	And so, you know, what's the point because your phone, which is probably not a Windows 10 phone, has, you know, Skype built into it as well.
622000	631000	Yeah, it's just, I think it's just a feature they're not using that often and they can get rid of it and boost performance probably somewhere else.
631000	632000	It'd be more beneficial.
632000	638000	TigerKalonChat says, but a console removing advertised features is no surprise. We've seen this done before.
638000	643000	I wonder if that's a little dig at the other OS thing going on in PlayStation.
643000	649000	This isn't the same thing at all. Other OS was like a completely new set of, you know, you could basically run a whole other OS.
649000	651000	This is snapping an app to the corner of the screen.
651000	652000	Yeah, it's more of a design.
652000	657000	Okay, damn. I guess I can't do that at the same plate. I don't think anyone really gives a shit about that.
657000	668000	I still can kind of see the perspective of this is not the OS that you advertised but, okay, it's a little different but I still can see why maybe some people would be sandy about it.
668000	678000	But I want to talk about Xbox's operating system on the One to begin with because I've got to be honest, and I am an Xbox One owner and I do like the Xbox One.
678000	683000	Y'all know I love Forza and, you know, Halo and things that you can only do on Xbox.
683000	687000	I kind of think the Twitch app runs better on Xbox but anyway, I digress.
687000	694000	I do think though the OS and the layout and all that stuff is a fucking mess.
694000	699000	It's just a mess. It is really hard to navigate with a controller.
699000	704000	I understand they built it for Kinect but how long has Kinect been gone now?
705000	708000	Excuse me, I guess it's still around for the loyalists.
708000	710000	No, it's not.
710000	712000	Microsoft has not been pushing the Kinect for quite some time.
712000	714000	They're pushing the Kinect like Sony's pushing the Vita.
714000	716000	Touché.
716000	721000	So I feel like the Xbox, to begin with, is a mess.
721000	724000	Especially compared to PlayStation 4.
724000	729000	Fuck, Wii U is a pretty clean interface all things considered because there's not much there.
729000	733000	But it still is pretty clean compared to the Xbox One.
733000	740000	And it's not that Microsoft doesn't know how to do good, you know, firmware for their operating system.
740000	748000	I think the original Xbox 360 was something a lot of gamers really liked and kind of missed to be honest.
748000	749000	The blades?
749000	751000	The blades, yeah. I think the blades was great.
751000	753000	Especially compared to what we have now.
753000	756000	Honestly, it's really hard to find some things.
756000	758000	Well how are we going to get those advertisers in there if we're...
758000	760000	Fuck the advertisers.
760000	762000	Gotta have those Yaris ads or whatever.
762000	765000	Do not buy a fucking advertising box for my TV.
765000	767000	Fuck the advertisements.
767000	771000	What are you going to do about it? We can just change our fucking firmware whenever we want.
771000	773000	And those ads are going to be there. What are you going to fucking do about it?
773000	775000	You're going to throw your system away?
775000	777000	Sony has advertisements, to be fair.
777000	782000	But I don't find them as annoying because they're kind of, you know, they're kind of in the place...
782000	788000	Like they're in the store where you would, you know, like this game is advertised on sale now.
788000	790000	You know, when you're looking around a store.
790000	792000	It kind of makes a little more sense.
792000	796000	Whereas like I feel like on Xbox One it's just like, it's just bleh. Vomited.
796000	801000	Yeah, don't get me wrong. I mean I can understand, you know, cross-promoting stuff in the store that they're actually selling stuff.
801000	807000	But I'm talking about like on Xbox where it's like, you know, watch this on, you know, NBC or something like that.
807000	812000	Or hey, buy a car, you know. That is totally different.
812000	815000	Okay, some other comments in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
815000	819000	Brad from Pod Culture says, the Kinect is an excellent Skype device.
819000	822000	We used it for episode 500 to get Christina in on the show.
822000	826000	So yeah, I mean, hell, this show relies on Skype as well, which is not through our Xbox.
826000	828000	But we love getting calls from Xboxes.
828000	834000	Let's see, sj100matt says, yeah, I don't really like the operating system either and I like my Xbox One a lot.
834000	839000	And Raginator in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, blades with red rings.
839000	843000	Okay, the red rings was not what I was talking about.
843000	847000	It was a completely separate issue, which yes, Microsoft deserves crap for.
847000	850000	But that was, you know, years ago. I think we're all past it.
850000	853000	So, but the operating system itself worked fine.
853000	859000	So anyway, I'll be very curious to see what Microsoft plans to redirect those additional resources for.
859000	866000	I mean, if they're getting rid of snap mode, they must be trying to shave off some always stored memory that uses that snap thing.
866000	868000	So I'll be kind of curious what they're going to use.
868000	872000	They're going to have a lot more processing power for all those Silverlight ads that they'll add.
872000	882000	All right, anyway, let's get into some other gaming news after we take care of some other business here at the top of the show,
882000	884000	including how was your gaming week?
884000	888000	What types of video games have you been playing this week? Dark Sakura?
888000	890000	I've been playing Smite the Patriarchy.
890000	897000	And I'm kidding. I've been playing...
898000	901000	One of my longest, oldest friends, Neil, just walked into the studio.
901000	904000	He's here to pick up some wine that I got on my trip yesterday.
904000	907000	So yes, anyway, but he's showing... Is that Amiibo? Is that a Pucci Amiibo?
907000	909000	Oh yes, there's a Pucci Amiibo. Oh, he just threw it over here at me.
909000	911000	See, this is why we need to be on video.
911000	913000	That is an Ami... Oh yeah, there it is. Look, on its butt.
913000	918000	Amiibo, you touch its butt to the screen and that's how you can unlock Pucci.
918000	920000	That's from the new 3DS game, right? Okay, yeah.
920000	921000	Touch its butt.
921000	926000	That's what I thought. I touched its butt and now I will give it back to my friend, Neil, who I've known since I was 12 years old.
926000	928000	There you go. Anyway.
928000	932000	So we've been playing Legend of Zelda A Link to the Past, actually.
932000	933000	Old school.
933000	936000	We're on the Dark World now and it's been pretty fun.
936000	944000	But I'm like the one who knows where all the stuff is in the game and kind of navigating hubby through it.
944000	948000	So it's been pretty fun and I'm actually still playing World of Warcraft.
948000	953000	I'm super loving Legion. I wish more of my friends would be on to play with me.
953000	955000	Not that she's going to guilt trip him or anything.
956000	961000	Well, but I've really been having a good time playing and I've actually made new friends.
961000	968000	And I spent like 10 minutes earlier today berating somebody for berating our healer.
968000	973000	Because if you're going to be a shit to somebody who's actually doing a good job, expect to be giving shit back.
973000	975000	You know, I'm just saying. Be nice.
975000	977000	Shitlords in my MMO?
977000	979000	It's more common than you think.
980000	985000	But apart from that, I haven't really been doing a whole bunch.
985000	987000	And this is the reason I was out last week.
987000	991000	I actually have a chronic sinus infection.
992000	993000	Chronic?
993000	994000	Chronic.
994000	996000	Not like Snoop Dogg chronic.
996000	997000	No.
997000	1001000	The difference between it is that there's something that's causing the infection to stay up there.
1001000	1003000	So I'm on six weeks of antibiotics.
1003000	1004000	Fun.
1004000	1006000	Also means not a lot of game time.
1006000	1008000	Because I get headaches really easily now.
1009000	1013000	So that's been my week. Very minimalist.
1013000	1018000	Brad from Pod Culture is offering to play World of Warcraft with you in our chat room.
1018000	1019000	Blade's Edge.
1019000	1021000	Pay for my sub and I might.
1022000	1023000	You know what?
1023000	1024000	What?
1024000	1026000	You can earn all of it in game.
1026000	1030000	That's true. If you've never played WoW before, you can get the free-
1030000	1032000	It's like 58,000 gold right now though.
1032000	1033000	Is it really? That sounds expensive.
1033000	1036000	But can't you get like a free to start thing?
1036000	1038000	It's like a level 20 for free.
1038000	1041000	Oh yeah. It's only level 20 for free. You can't even send gold around or anything.
1041000	1043000	But it's free to start. I know that.
1043000	1048000	And I thought when you get the base game, which is probably what? Like 10 bucks now?
1048000	1049000	If that.
1049000	1050000	If that.
1050000	1055000	Maybe we'll have to bring back the VoG giveaways in the future. We'll give away a game card.
1055000	1057000	Play WoW with Jamie drawing.
1057000	1058000	Yeah.
1058000	1059000	I like it.
1059000	1063000	Well, I've actually got a couple of low levels that I can play with people.
1064000	1068000	Because Gary is supposed to be playing if he ever gets around to it.
1068000	1069000	There you go.
1069000	1074000	But other than that. Oh yeah. And also, I'm going to finish up watching Goblin this week.
1074000	1077000	Oh my god. I'm getting into K-dramas.
1077000	1083000	Oh gods. Was it you or somebody was telling me about this where, yeah, something like-
1083000	1084000	Goblin is amazing.
1084000	1087000	Like the goblin is roommates with death or something?
1087000	1088000	With the Grim Reaper, right.
1088000	1090000	Okay, yes. You were talking about this.
1090000	1095000	And as it turns out, as everyone get together, they were all everyone, of course, except the Goblin because he's immortal.
1095000	1098000	We're all reincarnations of people he knew.
1099000	1101000	On the next Young and the Restless.
1101000	1102000	It's fucking weird and I love it.
1102000	1106000	And they have like total moonlighting moments and I'm like, just kiss.
1106000	1108000	Just kiss already. Anyway.
1109000	1112000	All right. Loki, how was your gaming week?
1112000	1115000	I'm just basically Skyrim remastered.
1115000	1121000	So I restarted my game because I was playing through like a heavily modded game and it was fun for a while.
1121000	1124000	But then I wanted more of a challenge so I restarted without mods.
1124000	1128000	Still going to cheat within the game itself.
1128000	1131000	You know, any exploit that you can do without mods is what I'm going to do.
1131000	1133000	Do you play on your laptop or do you play on like PlayStation?
1133000	1134000	On PlayStation 4.
1134000	1137000	Oh, okay. So how is the selection of mods there?
1137000	1141000	It's all right. I mean, you can't do any of like the graphical mods and stuff like that.
1141000	1144000	But I mean, it's fun to mess around with.
1144000	1146000	I still haven't gone and played Fallout 4 yet.
1146000	1153000	So no Gran Titica or whatever that mod is called that makes all the women topless, even Grandma?
1153000	1154000	No.
1154000	1155000	That doesn't exist on PlayStation 4?
1155000	1156000	No, it does not.
1156000	1157000	That's too bad.
1157000	1161000	Probably not an Xbox One either because I'm imagining that that's probably highly moderated.
1161000	1164000	Even if it was there, I probably couldn't find it.
1164000	1166000	That's what PC is for.
1166000	1167000	I see.
1167000	1168000	Long live PC. Yeah.
1168000	1169000	So I've been playing a lot of that.
1169000	1175000	Actually, it's funny. I get a lot of use out of my PlayStation VR, but just as that second screen.
1175000	1180000	You know, because my wife will be watching TV and so I'll play the PlayStation VR and play like Skyrim in it.
1180000	1187000	And it's kind of fun. I wish Skyrim had like a VR mode to it because, you know, even watching it with just that static screen,
1187000	1190000	there's a lot of times it feels very immersive because of that.
1190000	1195000	I do really wish that they would fix that stupid screen drifting problem.
1195000	1202000	It's just, it's really bad having to recenter that thing all the time because it slowly drifts to the left.
1202000	1210000	I wish it's something they would address quite quickly being that this has been a problem for almost six months now.
1210000	1213000	I don't know.
1213000	1217000	Other than that, I mean, that's pretty much what my gaming week has been.
1217000	1219000	I haven't really been playing too much Ingress.
1219000	1221000	Haven't played any Pokemon Go.
1222000	1225000	I'm trying to think if I've played any PlayStation VR games.
1225000	1233000	I almost bought some stuff on there, but I may try a little bit of Planet 3 since that's going to be something that's coming out for the next PlayStation Plus.
1233000	1240000	But yeah, it's just Skyrim because it's very immersive and there's like, here's the best part.
1240000	1245000	Like I've been playing Skyrim since it first came out and there's still quests I haven't done yet.
1245000	1248000	Like there's quests like I just get to them like, shit, I haven't done this one yet.
1248000	1251000	It's like, my God, the amount of content in there.
1251000	1256000	The only person I know that's done literally every quest in Skyrim is Alan.
1256000	1263000	And yes, I realize when I say that, I do know there's ones that like, I don't know if they reset daily or they come back.
1263000	1265000	They just, they keep going.
1265000	1267000	Okay, so obviously he still gets those, but that's it.
1267000	1272000	He's done like every other quest besides, I think he never got into the second expansion or something.
1272000	1275000	But like in the base game, he did them all.
1275000	1277000	I was like, wow, you're hot.
1280000	1282000	Yeah, I mean, it's just, it's fun.
1282000	1284000	It's still fun just to mess around with that.
1284000	1291000	And even after this time, which I can see that might be the draw of why, you know, when it's coming to the Switch that might be still worth it.
1291000	1294000	But for a $60 game though, I don't know.
1294000	1298000	But the content's definitely, I mean, $60 is the amount of content you're getting in that.
1298000	1300000	I mean, it's hundreds of hours of stuff.
1301000	1306000	Let's see, over in our chat over at live.vognetware.com, we have a chatter named SuperbOwl.
1306000	1310000	I don't know if that's one of our regulars who renamed or if it's a new person, but SuperbOwl.
1310000	1312000	And I think this is a question for you, Logie.
1312000	1314000	Does your family ever fuck with you when you've got the headset on?
1314000	1316000	Not really.
1316000	1318000	No? They know better?
1318000	1321000	My son usually say, what are you doing? What are you doing?
1321000	1323000	Because he doesn't know what it is.
1324000	1330000	And then my other son will be like, I really wish I could play Job Simulator right now.
1330000	1333000	Daddy, can I play with the headset? Can I do Job Simulator?
1333000	1334000	I'm like, no, I'm playing my game.
1334000	1336000	How about you get a real job, kiddo?
1336000	1338000	He likes playing with Job Simulator. That's the thing.
1338000	1342000	I mean, he'll mess around with, like, I watched him play.
1342000	1347000	He's played through most of Job Simulator. I haven't really played through much of it, but he enjoys that quite a bit.
1348000	1350000	So I'm looking for more games like that.
1350000	1355000	I hope VR mode for Minecraft comes out on that at some point, because I know they have it on mobile.
1355000	1360000	Mobile's pretty fun, but it would be nice to have that more widespread.
1360000	1362000	I just want more content, more, more, more.
1362000	1368000	Like Resident Evil 7, holy shit, that's not my type of game, but my god, does that look fucking amazing on VR.
1368000	1372000	So let's talk about my gaming week a little bit, because I'm going to piggyback on that.
1372000	1376000	So I didn't really play Resident Evil 7 because I don't do well with the scary games,
1376000	1378000	especially the gory ones.
1378000	1381000	I didn't buy the full game, but I finally got around to playing that last demo,
1381000	1384000	or I should say, watching Alan play that last demo.
1384000	1388000	That was something that was happening when there wasn't a show last week,
1388000	1392000	is that we were sitting around and Alan was actually playing the kitchen demo.
1392000	1394000	And so I got to see a lot of that.
1394000	1396000	And I got to say, you know, it does look really good.
1396000	1400000	It doesn't look like Resident Evil to me, which isn't necessarily a bad thing at all.
1400000	1402000	I mean, I'm all for new directions for franchises.
1403000	1406000	But yeah, you definitely can kind of see some of the PT influence in it.
1406000	1408000	But I don't think it's fair to just say it ripped off PT.
1408000	1411000	You know, it's kind of doing its own thing.
1411000	1415000	More power to them if they saw there was a market being underserved.
1415000	1416000	Sure.
1416000	1419000	More power to them to take it over, and it worked out well for them.
1419000	1426000	But yeah, so I was watching that, and then I did watch Shane stream it for a little bit,
1426000	1429000	because he was doing a VR stream where he was like screaming and all that stuff.
1430000	1432000	You know, in his own way.
1432000	1434000	And it was just really violent.
1434000	1438000	And it got to a really, really violent part where I was like, I don't need this.
1438000	1441000	So I turned it off. I didn't really watch it.
1441000	1444000	Plus, if Shane's out there, I want everybody to know,
1444000	1448000	Shane lied, because he said he was going to stream in VR, and he did,
1448000	1451000	until he got too scared, then he turned off the VR.
1451000	1453000	And I was like, this is false advertising, and I left.
1455000	1457000	Anyway, all right, all in good fun.
1457000	1458000	So let me think.
1458000	1460000	Other games that I played this week.
1460000	1463000	So while I was sick, I was playing some PlayStation 4.
1463000	1465000	I was home from work for like two days.
1465000	1467000	I missed two days of work because of it.
1467000	1471000	I ended up playing randomly a ton of Axiom Verge.
1471000	1473000	You remember this game that came out a couple years ago?
1473000	1475000	It's basically a Super Metroid.
1475000	1478000	I don't want to say it's a clone, because it does its own thing.
1478000	1482000	You have these different power-ups that you can teleport through walls,
1482000	1486000	or you can hack enemies that change the way they function.
1486000	1489000	You might have an enemy that shoots a laser beam that harms you,
1489000	1492000	but if you hack it, it will do a laser beam that helps you
1492000	1494000	cut through walls and other enemies and stuff.
1494000	1496000	So kind of like some different ideas,
1496000	1498000	but otherwise it plays a lot like a Super Metroid game.
1498000	1500000	If you guys haven't played it, check it out,
1500000	1502000	especially if you like Super Metroid.
1502000	1505000	It's a lot of fun, but the difficulty level's a little higher,
1505000	1508000	so I'm even having some problems getting through some parts.
1508000	1512000	It's just like, wow, you kind of get beat up over and over again.
1512000	1514000	But otherwise, I am having fun with that game.
1515000	1519000	I had a friend over the other night who's a really big fan of Super Smash Bros.,
1519000	1521000	so I was playing Super Smash Bros. on Wii U,
1521000	1523000	probably more than I have in quite some time,
1523000	1528000	and I didn't even realize I still hadn't unlocked Duck Hunt all this time later.
1528000	1532000	I had not played enough to unlock that all this time,
1532000	1534000	so we finally got that unlocked, so that's cool.
1534000	1537000	Funny enough that you mentioned that work-related.
1537000	1539000	I can't really say what I'm working on,
1539000	1543000	but I'm going to be working not in my normal office position
1543000	1545000	for the next six weeks,
1545000	1548000	and part of that is part of this immersion thing that they're doing.
1548000	1552000	They're going to have a Smash Bros. Melee tournament on the second day there,
1552000	1553000	so I get to play that.
1553000	1557000	I haven't played Melee, so that'll be interesting.
1557000	1559000	Yeah, Melee, you've got to go back a little bit to practice on Melee.
1559000	1562000	I've never played Melee. I've never owned it.
1562000	1564000	Oh, well, good luck.
1565000	1567000	I've been playing against people that haven't played video games before,
1567000	1569000	so it's not going to be that hard.
1569000	1571000	Maybe you can do all right.
1571000	1573000	So there was that,
1573000	1577000	and then I've been playing some of the old standbys that I play a lot of,
1577000	1579000	still playing Final Fantasy XIV.
1579000	1582000	Overwatch, I've been playing a lot more Overwatch this week.
1582000	1587000	I got mad at Overwatch last week, so we didn't do a show last week,
1587000	1590000	so I didn't get to tell you guys about how I got mad at Overwatch,
1590000	1592000	but I got really frustrated with the matchmaking in that game,
1592000	1594000	specifically for Capture the Flag.
1594000	1597000	There's only so many losses I can take before I'm just like,
1597000	1599000	fuck everything, I hate this, blah, blah, blah,
1599000	1602000	and I kind of hit that point during the week we had off,
1602000	1605000	and so I haven't touched Capture the Flag ever since.
1605000	1608000	But what I am finding that I really enjoy in Overwatch right now
1608000	1610000	is the Mystery Heroes mode,
1610000	1612000	and that's pretty much where I'm getting all my loot boxes right now,
1612000	1616000	and I kind of think Blizzard is going to have to balance this a little bit.
1616000	1619000	If you do the Arcade mode,
1619000	1623000	you're actually encouraged to win more loot boxes that way
1623000	1625000	than you would in playing Quick Play,
1625000	1628000	because if you win nine matches in a week, you get three loot boxes,
1628000	1631000	so it's like in the Arcade, but Quick Play you don't get anything.
1631000	1633000	What's Arcade mode like?
1633000	1636000	All Arcade mode is it changes the rules of the original game,
1636000	1640000	that's all it is, so it's like you can do one mode which is no limits,
1640000	1645000	where you can have each person on your team be the same hero if you want,
1645000	1646000	you're not locked to one.
1646000	1647000	You get the map breaking?
1647000	1648000	Yeah.
1648000	1651000	Arcade also has the one versus one, which is cool.
1651000	1655000	The capture the flag, but that'll be gone by the time this event's gone.
1655000	1657000	I just need someone to show me the ropes.
1657000	1665000	Get Alan, because Alan has a level of 270 right now in that game,
1665000	1666000	it's pretty crazy.
1666000	1668000	But here's the one I like,
1668000	1672000	and I think this kind of helps stabilize the skill levels a little bit,
1672000	1674000	is Mystery Heroes is an Arcade,
1674000	1678000	and in that one, obviously you get a random hero assigned to you,
1678000	1682000	but every time you die, you get a new hero in the spawn room.
1682000	1683000	Interesting.
1683000	1688000	So you are kind of forced to learn all 22 heroes, basically.
1688000	1691000	So it's kind of one of those you can kind of,
1691000	1694000	you're kind of competent with everybody,
1694000	1696000	but you're not necessarily really good with anybody.
1696000	1699000	Well, unless you play some Quick Play and, you know.
1699000	1700000	I was just going to play Mei all the time.
1700000	1702000	Yeah, play with Mei? Mei's pretty cool.
1702000	1704000	Mei can be really annoying,
1704000	1707000	but you have to kind of learn how to get on the other side of people
1707000	1708000	so you can surprise them,
1708000	1710000	because Mei is all about surprise,
1710000	1713000	so you can freeze them and then shoot an icicle to their head
1713000	1714000	and one-shot them, basically.
1714000	1719000	So Mei can be really infuriatingly hard on the other team.
1719000	1720000	I think that is a challenge.
1720000	1721000	If they have a good player.
1721000	1723000	So, let's see.
1723000	1726000	And Brad from Pod Culture in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,
1726000	1727000	Farah rules.
1727000	1729000	Yeah, I agree. I love Farah.
1729000	1731000	SSG100Matt in chat says,
1731000	1733000	Yeah, the capture the flag match is bad.
1733000	1734000	Matchmaking is bad.
1734000	1736000	I'm also getting knocked out of game because there are not enough players.
1736000	1739000	Yeah, I don't like the capture the flag thing at all.
1739000	1743000	But I kissed and made up with Overwatch,
1743000	1745000	and I've been playing more of it this week.
1745000	1747000	And I even did some streaming.
1747000	1748000	Cheap plug for my channel.
1748000	1750000	Rob Roberts over on Twitch.
1750000	1752000	Check that out.
1752000	1756000	Also, I want to read this comment about Axiom Verge from Stoppy
1756000	1758000	in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com,
1758000	1759000	who says,
1759000	1760000	It's a nice game.
1760000	1761000	It got too samey for me,
1761000	1763000	but the boss fights were really dope.
1763000	1765000	Pixel art was beautiful.
1765000	1767000	All made by one guy, basically.
1767000	1769000	Yeah, I mean, that's also impressive.
1769000	1771000	Like, one guy did the whole thing.
1771000	1773000	I think he did the music, too,
1773000	1775000	and he did everything,
1775000	1777000	and that's pretty darn impressive.
1777000	1778000	So, go you.
1778000	1781000	Yeah, some of the boss fights are really epic.
1781000	1784000	Like, some of them will suddenly zoom out the room,
1784000	1787000	so the room is suddenly four times the size.
1787000	1790000	Which is kind of, I guess, what they did with Kraid in Super Metroid, right?
1790000	1791000	Remember how that was epic?
1791000	1794000	Where this, like, Kraid grew so big,
1794000	1796000	it was, like, twice the size of the screen.
1796000	1797000	Remember that?
1797000	1799000	Well, remember if that, or think if that happened,
1799000	1801000	but it all, like, the screen zoomed out,
1801000	1803000	so you could see it all happening at once.
1803000	1805000	That's what Axiom Verge does in some parts,
1805000	1806000	which is pretty cool.
1806000	1808000	Yeah, it's pretty cool. I like that.
1808000	1810000	Okay, I think that's it for my gaming week.
1810000	1811000	That's enough.
1811000	1812000	So, we'll get into housekeeping,
1812000	1814000	of which I don't have a lot to say.
1814000	1816000	We don't have a whole lot of events coming up,
1816000	1818000	except for, I will mention,
1818000	1820000	Orange Lawns Radio and VOG Network
1820000	1823000	will be a part of the Sacramento Indie Arcade
1823000	1824000	again this year.
1824000	1826000	And if you've been listening to the show
1826000	1828000	for a little while now,
1828000	1830000	you know that we've done this event here locally
1830000	1831000	for the past couple years.
1831000	1833000	So, this will be our third year participating.
1833000	1835000	So, Sac Indie Arcade is going to happen
1835000	1837000	at the West Sacramento Convention Center.
1837000	1839000	So, this is probably for you locals,
1839000	1841000	but I would say it's worth a drive up from the Bay Area.
1841000	1842000	If you happen to live over there,
1842000	1843000	you should check that out.
1843000	1846000	It's going to be on Saturday, April the 8th,
1846000	1848000	at the West Sacramento Community Center.
1848000	1850000	More information at Indiearcade.org.
1850000	1852000	We will be there.
1852000	1855000	I'm almost positive our pals from Video Game Bang,
1855000	1857000	you know, another show here in the area
1857000	1858000	who we've had on our show before,
1858000	1860000	I'm positive they'll be there in some capacity.
1860000	1861000	And who knows who else?
1861000	1862000	Who knows who else we'll meet this year
1862000	1864000	that we'll end up dragging onto our own program
1864000	1866000	in the coming weeks.
1866000	1868000	So, check that out in April
1868000	1870000	over in West Sacramento.
1870000	1874000	Alright, let's get into some other gaming news.
1874000	1875000	We'll start off with Loki.
1875000	1877000	What happened this week in gaming?
1877000	1878000	Not a whole lot.
1878000	1879000	No, just kidding.
1879000	1881000	Lots of stuff, actually.
1881000	1882000	So, the big thing, though,
1882000	1884000	we've been talking about this for a while now,
1884000	1888000	the whole ZeniMax versus Oculus lawsuit thing
1888000	1889000	that was going on.
1889000	1892000	Well, they finally have finished the lawsuit.
1892000	1895000	So, ZeniMax ended up winning a portion
1895000	1898000	of the damages that they sought.
1898000	1900000	So, originally they were hoping to get
1900000	1902000	the whole $2 billion,
1902000	1903000	but they got a quarter of that,
1903000	1905000	so $500 million,
1905000	1908000	which is definitely not a small number.
1908000	1911000	Yeah, that's still a lot of money.
1911000	1912000	That's a lot of money.
1912000	1916000	So, basically, the reason they came up with that amount,
1916000	1917000	not the $2 billion,
1917000	1920000	is because they found that Palmer Lucky
1920000	1924000	did fail to comply with a nondisclosure agreement,
1924000	1925000	but at the same time,
1925000	1928000	they didn't find that Oculus misappropriated
1928000	1930000	any trade secrets.
1930000	1933000	So, they got them on that one count,
1933000	1935000	but not anything else.
1935000	1937000	So, I'm kind of glad that this is all over.
1938000	1940000	Yeah, but no, it ain't over.
1940000	1942000	Appeal, appeal, appeal, appeal.
1942000	1943000	It's not over yet.
1943000	1944000	True.
1944000	1946000	But it's interesting that it didn't go to settlement,
1946000	1948000	because usually these legal things
1948000	1950000	that come up on OLR all the time,
1950000	1953000	which I admit, none of us are lawyers,
1953000	1955000	so we can only kind of look at it
1955000	1957000	from a gamer perspective,
1957000	1961000	but usually these things get settled
1961000	1962000	that we bring up on the show.
1962000	1964000	So, to hear like $500 million,
1964000	1965000	that's a lot of money,
1965000	1966000	and you have to wonder like,
1966000	1970000	how might that impact Oculus' future?
1970000	1973000	You know, especially when the VR game
1973000	1975000	is getting more and more crowded, it seems, right?
1975000	1980000	Between HTC Vive and PlayStation VR
1980000	1983000	and cheaper alternatives like Gear VR
1983000	1984000	and so on and so on.
1984000	1986000	Like, how might this affect Oculus
1986000	1987000	at the end of the day, if at all?
1987000	1990000	I mean, maybe they can just,
1990000	1992000	maybe Facebook can lose $500 million easy,
1992000	1994000	but I don't know.
1994000	1995000	It would seem like that's a big chunk
1995000	1996000	of change to lose.
1996000	1998000	That, yeah, I mean,
1998000	2000000	a quarter of your funding,
2000000	2001000	that's quite a bit.
2001000	2002000	Yeah.
2002000	2004000	Stoppy with his perspective in chat
2004000	2006000	over at live.vognetwork.com says,
2006000	2007000	really strange result for the case.
2007000	2009000	I didn't think they had a case,
2009000	2011000	but I guess they did on the non-disclosure stuff.
2011000	2014000	I hear they also want to halt Rift sales.
2014000	2015000	Yeah, I'd heard about that too.
2015000	2018000	Maybe something where they get,
2018000	2020000	they have to get the payment again
2020000	2021000	or something before that can start again,
2021000	2022000	but again, that's all gonna get tied up
2022000	2023000	in appeals anyway.
2023000	2025000	That probably will not happen.
2025000	2027000	Dungeonbuster in chat says,
2027000	2029000	high price to pay for breaking an NDA.
2029000	2031000	Ooh, ain't that the truth?
2031000	2032000	Dungeonbuster continues,
2032000	2034000	Carmack was not impressed by the software
2034000	2036000	analyst ZeniMax brought to court.
2036000	2038000	Yeah, he posted a whole little thing
2038000	2041000	on social media, I think,
2041000	2043000	that was picked up by some blog somewhere
2043000	2045000	and obviously not happy about it.
2045000	2047000	So, hmm.
2047000	2050000	All right, well, the legal things
2050000	2052000	will continue, I'm sure.
2054000	2056000	To register participation for this week's
2056000	2057000	episode of Orange Lounge Radio at
2057000	2060000	vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, palm.
2060000	2063000	Meanwhile, let's talk about the Nintendo 3DS.
2063000	2065000	Obviously, we've talked a lot about the Switch
2065000	2066000	in the past few weeks.
2066000	2067000	Which I'd like to update.
2067000	2068000	Yes?
2068000	2069000	I have canceled my fucking pre-order.
2069000	2070000	You did?
2070000	2071000	Yes.
2071000	2073000	Oh, so to follow up from a couple weeks ago,
2073000	2075000	you were kind of threatening to do it,
2075000	2076000	and now you've gone through with it.
2076000	2077000	I just, the way I looked at it,
2077000	2079000	I mean, I was looking at what titles
2079000	2081000	are coming out in the timeframe that they're coming out.
2081000	2083000	It just did not make any sense to purchase
2083000	2085000	a system for one game that I can play
2085000	2086000	on a system I already have.
2086000	2087000	Yeah.
2087000	2090000	And the advantages, like, the graphic
2090000	2093000	advantages, I guess, between the Switch
2093000	2095000	and the Wii U weren't that great.
2095000	2097000	It's like a slightly increased draw distance
2097000	2099000	and the resolution's a hair higher.
2099000	2100000	Yeah.
2100000	2101000	And that's it.
2101000	2104000	And it's like, why would I drop $400 for that?
2104000	2107000	You know, and I gotta admit, and I think
2107000	2108000	we talked about this a couple weeks ago,
2108000	2110000	and I don't want to double-talk ourselves
2110000	2112000	too much, but, you know, I gotta admit,
2112000	2114000	even I'm getting to a point where I'm like,
2114000	2116000	do I really need to get one right now?
2116000	2118000	Because I feel like, I really feel like
2118000	2120000	Holiday is the true launch of the Switch.
2120000	2121000	Yeah, exactly.
2121000	2123000	I think when there's more titles out,
2123000	2125000	it's gonna be worth it, maybe,
2125000	2127000	but I'm still worried, like,
2127000	2131000	there's news about EA, we didn't have it
2131000	2133000	in the show, but talking about how they're
2133000	2135000	moving their other franchises, the Frostbite,
2135000	2139000	like, you know, Madden, and I want to say FIFA,
2139000	2142000	if that's the case, I mean, the FIFA that
2142000	2144000	they have on there now is based on a really
2144000	2146000	old version of FIFA, because they can't run
2146000	2149000	these modern engines, and as these other
2149000	2151000	systems get higher and higher spec,
2151000	2153000	that's less that they can port over.
2153000	2155000	I mean, I don't know, it's...
2155000	2158000	Yeah, I mean, and that third-party support,
2158000	2160000	I mean, we saw what happened with Wii U,
2160000	2162000	if the technology can't handle it, but...
2162000	2164000	Well, and I'd said this before, and this
2164000	2166000	kind of leads into this story a little bit,
2166000	2168000	is that, you know, when I think the Switch
2168000	2170000	more as a handheld system, I'm way more
2170000	2172000	comfortable with it than when I start to
2172000	2174000	think about it as a console system.
2174000	2177000	I mean, I just, I always wanted the 3DS to
2177000	2179000	be able to hook up to the TV, I think that
2179000	2181000	would be awesome, you have to pay, like,
2181000	2184000	a $300 cable to get hard-wired in your DS
2184000	2186000	to be able to stream things legally,
2186000	2187000	like Pokemon, right?
2187000	2189000	If those streamers you see on Twitch are
2189000	2191000	doing it legally, you know, they had to mod
2191000	2193000	their 3DS to do it, which is not cheap.
2193000	2195000	So, you know, I always wanted to be able to
2195000	2197000	do, like, DS on the TV, so I think this is
2197000	2199000	cool when I look at it from the perspective
2199000	2201000	of a portable, but even I'm, like,
2201000	2203000	I'm really trying to cut Nintendo a break
2203000	2205000	here, you guys, and I probably still will
2205000	2207000	end up buying the system, because I'm a
2207000	2210000	consumer whore, and how, but I'm getting
2210000	2213000	really frustrated that Nintendo is staying
2213000	2215000	quiet on as much as they are. Like, this
2215000	2217000	whole fact that the Virtual Console thing,
2217000	2219000	that they are still not disclosing the
2219000	2221000	details on it, I mean, honestly, what it
2221000	2222000	says to me, it's not there. Virtual Console's
2222000	2223000	not going to be there when the system
2223000	2225000	launches. That's what the quiet is telling
2225000	2227000	me, is that all these things we think are
2227000	2230000	coming because of the Super Nintendo over
2230000	2232000	the internet, which they teased on their
2232000	2234000	website in the one game a month and all this,
2234000	2236000	it's not going to be there in March. That's
2236000	2238000	what this silence is telling me, which is
2238000	2240000	why I'm saying I really think it's all
2240000	2243000	going to be built in later on in the holiday.
2243000	2245000	Just like, so, what did they say? It's going
2245000	2247000	to run USB 2.0 at first, but a firmware
2247000	2249000	thing is going to bring it up to 3.0, and
2249000	2250000	all this stuff, right?
2250000	2252000	That's not how USB ports work.
2252000	2253000	Isn't that weird?
2253000	2254000	That's not how it works.
2254000	2255000	It's weird.
2255000	2257000	It either is or it isn't. You can't just
2257000	2259000	patch that in. That's not how that fucking
2259000	2263000	works. And that's the thing, it's like, a
2263000	2265000	lot of this stuff, and they're not the
2265000	2267000	only ones at fault with this type of stuff,
2267000	2270000	but like, you can't promise all these
2270000	2272000	features and not have them there at launch.
2272000	2274000	It's stupid. Oh yeah, we'll patch it in
2274000	2276000	later. Why? Why am I going to buy this
2276000	2279000	right now? It's not fucking ready yet. And
2279000	2282000	I don't know, but basically the other day
2282000	2285000	it came down to, what games do I want?
2285000	2287000	To be fair, Loki, if they can sell
2287000	2289000	millions of them this holiday, all this
2289000	2291000	blue in the face talk won't even matter.
2291000	2293000	I mean, it's going to be the 3DS all over
2293000	2295000	again, right? 3DS was weak when it first
2295000	2297000	launched, ended up one of the strongest
2297000	2299000	systems ever. I bet a lot of people that
2299000	2301000	have the Wii U and the 3DS will probably
2301000	2303000	pick the system up. Will it attract new
2303000	2306000	people like we did? Probably not.
2306000	2309000	But Nintendo, to be fair again, Nintendo
2309000	2311000	did something they never do today. They
2311000	2314000	advertised during that concert that
2314000	2316000	everybody's watching that has a football
2316000	2319000	game around it. So, you know. Showing off
2319000	2321000	games that aren't going to be out in four
2321000	2323000	or six months, that's pretty nice. Alright,
2323000	2325000	well look, let me, I don't want to rehash
2325000	2327000	two weeks ago's episode too much, but
2327000	2329000	there's a reason why I bring this up, and
2329000	2331000	that is an important update, Loki. But
2331000	2333000	this whole fact that I'm talking about
2333000	2335000	when I see the Switch as a handheld
2335000	2338000	system, I am a bigger fan. But yet
2338000	2341000	Nintendo keeps insisting that the 3DS is
2341000	2343000	not done, and that this is a new home
2343000	2345000	console, which kind of, it actually kind
2345000	2347000	of frustrates me. Like, it actually kind
2347000	2349000	of frustrates me that I'm like, I'm trying
2349000	2351000	to adopt this as my new handheld, but you
2351000	2353000	are trying to like, convince me that 3DS
2353000	2356000	is still a thing, whereas I'm worried that
2356000	2358000	3DS is just your fallback guy. That if
2358000	2361000	somehow the Switch shits the bed, at least
2361000	2363000	you still have the 3DS. Like, I'm kind of
2363000	2365000	worried in that regard. But anyway, let
2365000	2367000	me elaborate on that a little bit, because
2367000	2369000	there was an interview this week with
2369000	2371000	Tatsumi Kimishima, who had talked about
2371000	2374000	in an interview, in a Q&A Japanese
2374000	2377000	financial results thing. The question was,
2377000	2379000	this is about your thoughts on having
2379000	2381000	both a Nintendo 3DS and Nintendo Switch
2381000	2383000	coexisting together. When a player first
2383000	2385000	uses the Nintendo Switch and recognizes
2385000	2387000	it as a portable device, is there a point
2387000	2389000	to releasing a next generation handheld
2389000	2392000	console? So, thank you, somebody kind of
2392000	2394000	calling him out on this, and clarifying
2394000	2396000	this, so here's the answer.
2396000	2398000	I believe that for the time being, the
2398000	2400000	Nintendo 3DS and Nintendo Switch can
2400000	2402000	coexist together. Compared to the Nintendo
2402000	2404000	3DS, the Nintendo Switch is different in
2404000	2406000	shape, size, and price, and the variety of
2406000	2408000	quantity of games that are currently playable
2408000	2410000	now, and different between the two. With
2410000	2412000	those differences in mind, I believe that
2412000	2414000	a Nintendo 3DS would work well for parents
2414000	2416000	that are looking into getting their children
2416000	2418000	their first games. Therefore, as a portable
2418000	2420000	gaming device, I believe that Nintendo
2420000	2422000	3DS has a different demand and market
2422000	2424000	than the Nintendo Switch, and as we've
2424000	2426000	gone about with portable consoles until
2426000	2428000	now, we will continue considering a
2428000	2433000	successor. So, Nintendo's viewing the 3DS
2433000	2435000	as the kiddie system, is what that quote
2435000	2437000	says to me. And that's, you know, we kind
2437000	2440000	of thought this when the 2DS was first
2440000	2442000	announced, that this was them really
2442000	2444000	trying to push it towards younger people
2444000	2446000	by taking the 3D out that, you know, have
2446000	2448000	all the youth warnings, to get more
2448000	2450000	younger people playing Pokemon and all
2450000	2452000	this. So now, at least with that quote,
2452000	2454000	it kind of just sounds to me like, if the
2454000	2456000	3DS is going to continue here for a couple
2456000	2458000	years, with the Switch and co-existing,
2458000	2460000	the 3DS, they are really pushing as a
2460000	2464000	entry-level kids gaming system. So,
2464000	2467000	Nintendo's embracing the kiddie games thing.
2467000	2469000	When they get that down to a price point
2469000	2470000	that makes sense like that, I mean, I
2470000	2472000	guess that would be okay.
2472000	2473000	Yeah.
2473000	2475000	That's definitely, I don't even know what
2475000	2477000	the 2DS is now, is that under $100
2477000	2478000	yet? I mean...
2478000	2480000	Well, like Black Friday, yeah, was like
2480000	2482000	$99. I don't know if that's still a thing,
2482000	2483000	but...
2483000	2484000	But, like, you get it down to like $50
2484000	2487000	or something, then, yeah, that's pretty,
2487000	2488000	pretty smoking.
2488000	2490000	Could you do that technology for $50?
2490000	2491000	I don't know.
2491000	2492000	Maybe? I don't know. I don't know how
2492000	2494000	cheap the tech is now. So, some folks in
2494000	2496000	chat over at Live.VogueNetwork.com
2496000	2497000	pointing out, it's Joe and Hunter Matt
2497000	2499000	saying, you can't really find 3DSs in
2499000	2501000	stores anymore. I've been to a ton of
2501000	2502000	stores over the past few weeks in
2502000	2504000	different states. I haven't seen a new
2504000	2506000	3DS XL anywhere. Yeah, they have
2506000	2509000	a lot of problems over the holidays,
2509000	2512000	and wasn't that in large part to Pokemon?
2512000	2516000	And, in some ways, Pokemon Go, and the
2516000	2518000	strength, to be fair, the strength of
2518000	2520000	Pokemon Sun and Moon as new games in the
2520000	2522000	franchise, they're great, but kind of
2522000	2525000	those two things combined created a huge
2525000	2527000	demand for Pokemon Sun and Moon and the
2527000	2529000	system to play them on. And, you know,
2529000	2531000	Sun and Moon have been selling, I don't
2531000	2534000	think they've outsold X and Y yet, but
2534000	2536000	they will, and they've already outsold
2536000	2538000	Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire.
2538000	2540000	I'm surprised they don't have a port of
2540000	2542000	that yet for, like, the Switch. Imagine
2542000	2544000	launching with that. Yet. Yeah, yet, but,
2544000	2546000	like, seriously, imagine launching with
2546000	2548000	something like that. I mean, that would,
2548000	2550000	I don't know, at least be a little better.
2550000	2552000	Okay, Bob Coffee's jumping in to correct
2552000	2554000	us here. The joy of having live chat.
2554000	2557000	2DS manufacturer suggested retail price
2557000	2561000	is $79 now. So, it is still pretty good.
2561000	2564000	So. I wish it folded it in half, but, you
2564000	2566000	know, it's still pretty good. You have
2566000	2568000	$79, though. You gotta leave some things
2568000	2570000	by the wayside. So. But, you know, again,
2570000	2572000	if you're trying to get your kids to play
2572000	2574000	Pokemon Sun and Moon, this can do it.
2574000	2576000	But does Sun and Moon actually work on
2576000	2578000	the older systems, or is it one of those
2578000	2580000	things you have to have the new 3DS for?
2580000	2582000	No, I have an old 3DS. As if that's not
2582000	2584000	fucking confusing enough as it is. It's
2584000	2586000	fine. It runs fine on the old 3DS. The
2586000	2588000	only part that gets a little choppy weird
2588000	2590000	is that camera where they kind of did
2590000	2592000	the Pokemon Snap thing. They put that in
2592000	2595000	Sun and Moon. But, like, I don't, I think
2595000	2597000	I did the introduction part of that, and
2597000	2599000	then I haven't even bothered to look for
2599000	2601000	other areas where you can do that. Like,
2601000	2603000	it's just, it's not something you have to
2603000	2605000	do in the game. And even if I had to, I
2605000	2607000	could probably fake it well enough. But
2607000	2610000	it seems to run well enough. And Bob
2610000	2613000	Coffee points out there is only one new
2613000	2616000	3DS only game. That's Xenoblade Chronicles.
2617000	2621000	Nothing so far. Well, didn't they...
2621000	2623000	No, that's not true. Xenoblade Chronicles,
2623000	2625000	yeah, it is, you have to have it for that.
2625000	2628000	Although, I believe that, um, Hyrule
2628000	2631000	Warriors ran like shit without it.
2631000	2634000	And I think it's the Fire Emblem that's
2634000	2636000	going to be the Fire Emblem Warriors that
2636000	2638000	they confirmed for 3DS. I think it's also
2638000	2640000	sporting the new 3DS logo on it.
2640000	2642000	I think that's probably going to be only
2642000	2644000	new 3DS, because it ran from what I hear
2644000	2648000	pretty terribly on the 3DS. Anyway, be
2648000	2651000	very curious to see how that develops
2651000	2654000	over the coming years, because I, I don't
2654000	2655000	know, I kind of think they should just,
2655000	2657000	like, seriously stop focusing on the 3DS.
2657000	2659000	But maybe... They may be doing that soon.
2659000	2661000	I mean, have there been a lot of
2661000	2663000	announcements for the 3DS? Yeah, that
2663000	2665000	Fire Emblem had one. Like, that's one. I
2665000	2667000	mean, what else is on the pipeline? Well,
2667000	2669000	it's still something that made me go,
2669000	2672000	leave it alone. But alright, you know,
2672000	2674000	okay, fine. You know, yes, there are a
2674000	2676000	ton of 3DSs out there, and you want to
2676000	2678000	put software on a platform where you
2678000	2679000	know lots of people will be able to buy
2679000	2681000	it. So, like, I get it, it makes sense,
2681000	2685000	but, you know, I just... Tell me more
2685000	2688000	about the Switch. Put those resources on,
2688000	2690000	on Virtual Console, and more Switch
2690000	2692000	games, and... Well, Fire Emblem,
2692000	2694000	Masao, or whatever, it doesn't seem like
2694000	2697000	it's an entry-level game for kids. No.
2697000	2699000	It's like, they're saying, oh, this is a
2699000	2701000	kid's system, but then they're putting,
2701000	2703000	like... You can kind of button mash in
2703000	2705000	those games, though. That's a load of
2705000	2708000	shit, is what it is. It's a load of shit.
2708000	2710000	Their excuse saying that it's a kid's
2710000	2714000	system is, that statement does not match
2714000	2716000	with the kind of product that they have
2716000	2719000	on those platforms. It's just, this is
2719000	2721000	staying around for a while, because
2721000	2724000	there's the, you know, the market
2724000	2726000	saturation for it, and just in case this
2726000	2728000	shit doesn't work out with the Switch, I
2728000	2730000	think would be better. But they can't say
2730000	2732000	that, obviously.
2732000	2734000	All right. Well, we'll see if Nintendo
2734000	2736000	will say anything in the coming weeks
2736000	2738000	before, you know, the less...
2738000	2739000	Or nothing at all.
2739000	2742000	Before the less-than-a-month ship day
2742000	2744000	for the Nintendo Switch. Can you believe
2744000	2747000	that? We are less than four weeks away
2747000	2748000	at this point, right?
2748000	2749000	Yeah.
2749000	2752000	Less than four weeks away from the Switch.
2752000	2755000	It's just, it's all happening so fast.
2755000	2756000	Then again, at the same time, this has
2756000	2758000	been a drawn-out thing for years and
2758000	2760000	years and years. It also feels like...
2760000	2762000	I'm just glad to be able to play Zelda
2762000	2764000	in a few weeks. That's pretty awesome.
2764000	2765000	That'll be cool. That'll be cool.
2765000	2766000	All right, DarkSakura, what do you have
2766000	2769000	for us in other news this week in gaming?
2769000	2771000	Some Squeamixie stuff.
2771000	2775000	Basically, Square Enix and Marvel Studios
2775000	2777000	has decided they're gonna play nice
2777000	2781000	together. Really nice. Everyone's gonna
2781000	2784000	love it. It's really great. Just saying.
2784000	2786000	Anyway, they are working on something
2786000	2790000	called the Avengers Project, being developed
2790000	2793000	by Crystal Dynamics in Eidos, Montreal.
2793000	2796000	I watched the trailer. Have you guys seen
2796000	2797000	the trailer for this?
2797000	2799000	Yes. This is kind of a real teaser, though.
2799000	2800000	Yeah, it is.
2800000	2802000	It doesn't really show any game.
2802000	2804000	But it just makes me think, I mean, we've
2804000	2807000	got some franchise... It's a franchise.
2807000	2811000	We've got some developers that are pretty
2811000	2813000	top-notch, I think, getting involved on this.
2813000	2816000	And yes, even high-profile developers
2816000	2817000	can make steaming piles of shit.
2817000	2818000	Sure.
2818000	2821000	But I'm looking forward to this one.
2821000	2823000	I think that whatever comes out of it
2823000	2826000	would have to be pretty good and really pretty.
2826000	2829000	Crystal D's record with these past two
2829000	2832000	Tomb Raider games is pretty A+.
2832000	2833000	I mean, those two games really kicked
2833000	2836000	a lot of ass. So, you think about, even
2836000	2838000	if they just somehow slapped the Avengers
2838000	2840000	into that, I think a lot of people would
2840000	2841000	be on board, right?
2841000	2842000	Yeah.
2842000	2844000	So, and maybe that's all this is.
2844000	2846000	And I think a lot of us are okay with that.
2846000	2847000	You know what?
2847000	2848000	I'm sure they're...
2848000	2849000	Black Widow's a really bad day.
2849000	2851000	No, if they were going to have me design
2851000	2854000	a game, it would be Jessica Jones with
2854000	2857000	her rage meter filled by liquor.
2857000	2859000	Let's see.
2859000	2861000	I would play that game all day.
2861000	2862000	Dungeonbuster in chat at
2862000	2863000	live.voguenetwork.com says,
2863000	2866000	I hope it's an Avengers ARPG.
2866000	2868000	The X-Men Legends series by Raven were great.
2868000	2870000	First Alliance was solid. Second one was meh,
2870000	2871000	but still fun.
2871000	2874000	So, and you were a big fan of those
2874000	2876000	Marvel Ultimate Alliance games, weren't you,
2876000	2877000	Darcy?
2877000	2878000	Yeah, for a bit.
2878000	2879000	They were okay. They were pretty fun.
2879000	2880000	You know what would be badass?
2880000	2882000	Even though I really don't like the combat
2882000	2884000	system at all, to put the Final Fantasy
2884000	2887000	XV combat system in an Avengers game.
2887000	2889000	I could be here for that.
2889000	2890000	I haven't played it yet.
2890000	2892000	Although, I mean, even though we talk
2892000	2894000	about it's Square Enix doing a Marvel game,
2894000	2895000	you know, this...
2895000	2896000	But they're not developing it.
2896000	2899000	Well, but this is also kind of the American
2899000	2900000	acquisitions.
2900000	2902000	It's Eidos, basically, what used to be that,
2902000	2904000	is kind of creating this.
2904000	2906000	It's not really coming from the people
2906000	2907000	that are doing Final Fantasy.
2907000	2909000	Not to say that crossover can't exist.
2909000	2910000	Yeah, they could re-use the engine.
2910000	2911000	I mean, yeah.
2911000	2914000	And to be fair, Crystal Dynamics also
2914000	2916000	made kind of smaller games.
2916000	2918000	Like they made like the Lara Croft Go.
2918000	2919000	Was them right?
2919000	2920000	Yeah, I think.
2920000	2923000	And then the Temple games.
2923000	2924000	I can't remember the name off the top of my head,
2924000	2927000	but they had some games on like PlayStation 3
2927000	2929000	that were like specifically for the download store.
2929000	2930000	They were more like co-op games.
2930000	2933000	And they were fun, but they were a little more small scale.
2933000	2934000	And they made me think a little more
2934000	2935000	of the Marvel's Ultimate Alliance.
2935000	2937000	But that trailer kind of made me think,
2937000	2941000	nah, this is on the level of like Rise of the Tomb Raider,
2941000	2942000	where this is going.
2942000	2943000	Well, we'll see how it...
2943000	2944000	Well, I hope.
2944000	2945000	Mobile game.
2945000	2946000	Ah, shit.
2946000	2947000	We'll see how it turns out at any rate,
2947000	2949000	because I'll be perfectly honest.
2949000	2952000	I'm ready for a good Avengers
2952000	2955000	or any kind of Marvel franchise that isn't.
2955000	2957000	I mean, nothing to say bad about Telltale.
2957000	2959000	You know, the Guardians of the Galaxy thing is interesting.
2959000	2963000	But in the Lego games, I'm kind of over them.
2963000	2965000	I would rather have like a really good
2965000	2970000	full scale adventure game, you know, as an Avenger.
2970000	2973000	You know, if they had it like where you had your core team
2973000	2976000	and it did sort of a Lara Croft-y style, you know,
2976000	2978000	thing for the Avengers through the world,
2978000	2980000	but you had a different series of missions
2980000	2983000	for each team or each person on the team,
2983000	2984000	that would be pretty rad.
2984000	2985000	Yeah.
2985000	2987000	And that, and I also, I mean,
2987000	2989000	this would be kind of a dream of mine,
2989000	2993000	is if we had like a throwback to like 80s Avengers
2993000	2995000	or late 90s Avengers.
2995000	2997000	Well, my thought is this will probably ultimately
2997000	3000000	be a movie tie-in because don't we have
3000000	3001000	another Avengers movie?
3001000	3002000	Is it this year or next year?
3002000	3004000	Infinity Wars is supposed to be coming out soon.
3004000	3007000	But Infinity Wars is like an everybody movie.
3007000	3009000	But is that this year or next year?
3009000	3011000	Because isn't Guardians of the Galaxy 2 this year?
3011000	3013000	Guardians of the Galaxy 2 is in May,
3013000	3016000	and I believe there's also going to be Thor Ragnarok this year.
3016000	3017000	I don't know.
3017000	3020000	So maybe somebody like Tiger Claw or somebody
3020000	3022000	that really follows these movies better than I do,
3022000	3024000	probably knows these exact release dates.
3024000	3025000	And I know they're supposed to be,
3025000	3027000	I think they're already talking another Doctor Strange,
3027000	3029000	or at least Doctor Strange tying in with Thor.
3029000	3030000	Yeah.
3030000	3032000	But there's also some one-off movies
3032000	3034000	people have very much been looking forward to,
3034000	3036000	like Black Panther, the Ms. Marvel movie
3036000	3038000	or whatever they're calling it.
3038000	3042000	Yeah, I think she will, officially in the comics now,
3042000	3043000	she's Captain Marvel.
3043000	3047000	Ms. Marvel is now the Kamala Khan, the stretchy girl.
3047000	3049000	Okay. Oh, so it's Captain Marvel, sorry.
3049000	3051000	So it'd be Carol Danvers.
3051000	3052000	Tiger Claw on chat says,
3052000	3054000	this year is Guardians of the Galaxy, Spider-Man,
3054000	3056000	and Thor Ragnarok.
3056000	3057000	I forgot about Spider-Man.
3057000	3061000	I forgot about the yet again Spider-Man redo.
3061000	3063000	Honestly enough, I haven't seen the movie
3063000	3065000	for the cinematic universe,
3065000	3069000	but I did see Captain America Civil War.
3069000	3071000	And I was like, if that's Spider-Man, I'm behind it.
3071000	3072000	Cause it was pretty fun.
3072000	3077000	Yeah, Black Panther, Avengers Infinity War Part 1
3077000	3080000	and Ant-Man and the Wasp are supposed to be 2018.
3080000	3081000	I am looking forward to that too.
3081000	3083000	And then 19 would be Captain Marvel
3083000	3086000	and the second part of the Infinity War.
3086000	3089000	So this game, I would think, Darkseid,
3089000	3091000	I know you're talking about your dream 80s project
3091000	3092000	and all this stuff.
3092000	3093000	I mean, they could do anything,
3093000	3096000	but I would assume this is gonna be some type of movie tie-in
3096000	3100000	for Avengers Part 1 or Part 2, Infinity War.
3101000	3103000	So just depending, I mean,
3103000	3105000	cause they didn't show any footage.
3105000	3106000	Now E3 could change it.
3106000	3108000	This could be a big E3 teaser.
3108000	3109000	They're gonna come out at E3
3109000	3111000	and show us something big.
3111000	3113000	And hopefully within those two years,
3113000	3117000	they can re-license the X-Men and Deadpool back.
3118000	3121000	Dear Marvel, bring back one of my favorite ever characters,
3121000	3123000	Monica Rambeau. Thank you.
3124000	3126000	But the whole Deadpool thing is really interesting
3126000	3129000	because that movie, getting the Globe nomination,
3129000	3132000	like really made some people kind of go, what?
3132000	3134000	Well, and now they're trying to get-
3134000	3135000	It didn't get an Oscar though, right?
3135000	3136000	It didn't get an Oscar nom, right?
3136000	3139000	Now they're also trying though to get Hugh Jackman in it
3139000	3142000	to do Wolverine, Deadpool crossover,
3142000	3144000	which always every time-
3144000	3146000	They already did and it was bad.
3146000	3147000	No, I mean a good one.
3147000	3149000	Not that thing that doesn't exist in my heart.
3149000	3151000	Reminder, that happened and it wasn't good.
3151000	3152000	That was never a movie, I'm sorry.
3152000	3155000	I'm not even the big comic fan she is, even I know that.
3155000	3156000	It doesn't exist in my heart.
3156000	3158000	It does not exist in my universe.
3158000	3162000	There was a few missteps in several Spider-Man movies that-
3162000	3165000	You have the Merc with the mouth and take out his mouth.
3166000	3167000	Stupid.
3168000	3169000	So stupid.
3169000	3175000	But no, I could just talk forever though about comics and stuff.
3175000	3177000	You need to bring back a podcast.
3177000	3180000	You know, I've been talking to Spike about it.
3180000	3182000	Oh, just what that boy needs.
3182000	3183000	Right?
3185000	3187000	We got Drag Race coming back soon.
3187000	3189000	He's gonna have that on his plate.
3189000	3191000	Okay, let's just get it out of the way.
3191000	3193000	I'm Team Trinity, thank you.
3193000	3196000	I'm a big fan of the way Nina Bonina paints herself.
3196000	3199000	I think I like some of those looks, I gotta say.
3199000	3200000	I got my eye on her.
3200000	3204000	She's got a little sloppiness though with her appendages, I'm just saying.
3204000	3205000	We're all a little sloppy.
3205000	3210000	All right, moving on before, as people consistently tune out of the show.
3210000	3212000	Let's move on to another story. Loki.
3212000	3216000	So this is kind of cool because I got pretty excited when I heard about the news regarding this.
3216000	3221000	You know, PlayStation Pro for me doesn't really seem like it's much of an upgrade for a lot of different games.
3221000	3225000	I mean, the support for the Pro mode for a lot of these games is kind of, you know, whatever.
3225000	3227000	And a lot of games didn't have that support.
3227000	3229000	Well, that's gonna change pretty soon.
3229000	3236000	PlayStation 4's 4.5 update, which is still in the beta phase and only you have to be in the beta program to get access to it.
3236000	3238000	They have a lot of improvements at their end.
3238000	3241000	So one of these improvements includes Boost Mode.
3241000	3253000	And what Boost Mode is, is it allows games that don't have this Pro mode or you can run it, you know, separate of Pro mode to run at a higher GPU and CPU clock speed.
3253000	3258000	And it improves the performance of games released before Pro mode was available.
3258000	3259000	What does this do?
3259000	3267000	It makes some of these games that were absolute dog shit as far as performance actually fucking playable and nice.
3267000	3269000	Like Just Cause 3, for example.
3269000	3273000	I saw another video, which actually you probably like, Final Fantasy XIV.
3273000	3276000	They showed, you know, the amount of lag that they were getting and everything.
3276000	3278000	Super silky smooth. It was just like...
3278000	3279000	Oh wow.
3279000	3281000	It was fantastic.
3281000	3284000	So just a lot of good things been hearing about it.
3284000	3287000	People trying it out and posting gameplay video and stuff like that.
3287000	3289000	I think it's gonna be a really good thing.
3289000	3294000	It actually kind of has me excited considering getting a PlayStation Pro just for that because it sounds...
3295000	3300000	Yeah, this is kind of something I think a lot of us Pro people kind of wish was there in the beginning.
3300000	3301000	But I'll take it. I'll take it.
3301000	3302000	Exactly.
3302000	3307000	The other thing that's gonna be coming with that 4.5 update is external hard drive support.
3307000	3309000	Which, my god, about time.
3309000	3314000	So you'll be able to connect the USB 3.0 external hard drive up to 8 terabytes of storage space.
3314000	3318000	And you can use it for PlayStation 4 games and applications and whatever.
3318000	3320000	So that's pretty awesome as well.
3320000	3326000	Well, they're also gonna be adding 3D Blu-ray support on the PlayStation VR.
3326000	3329000	Okay, that actually kind of makes me want a PlayStation VR.
3329000	3334000	Seriously, and look, I realize there aren't a ton of 3D Blu-rays out there.
3334000	3342000	But there's one that's very, very important that I own that my TV won't even work with the 3D thing anymore because those glasses are garbage.
3342000	3344000	And that's Tron.
3344000	3345000	Oh shit.
3345000	3353000	And so I could watch Tron Legacy in the PlayStation VR and, like, never before have I wanted a PlayStation VR so bad. Isn't that sad?
3353000	3356000	But it's true. I'm not gonna sit here and lie.
3356000	3360000	Like, the thing that might finally break me is being able to watch Tron Legacy in PlayStation VR.
3360000	3362000	And I do have a PlayStation VR.
3362000	3369000	For you, I would even let you borrow the other Blu-ray 3D movie I have, The Lion King.
3369000	3371000	No thanks. I'm good.
3372000	3376000	But yeah, Tron. Man, that's pretty awesome.
3376000	3382000	And that's awesome about the hard drive thing too. Now, Stobby in chat is asking, is the hard drive support only for Pro?
3382000	3384000	No, I believe it's for both systems.
3384000	3387000	Yeah, I don't see why that would be limited.
3387000	3394000	Really, the Pro really, I mean, if you haven't played with the Pro, it's the exact same as the other PlayStation 4.
3394000	3398000	It's just some of the inner workings are a little more beefy.
3398000	3405000	So it's like, you know, like running Windows 10 on two different computers. One of them has a slightly faster processor and better graphics card.
3405000	3411000	That's kind of what it is, basically. So I don't see why the hard drive thing would be any different.
3411000	3417000	Now, if only they would announce, oh, and PlayStation 1, 2, and game support.
3417000	3423000	Then Sony could get up there and drop the mic and jump off the stage like Lady Gaga just did. Right?
3423000	3430000	Come on. It's a PlayStation Pro. You can't run PlayStation 2 or 2 and 1 games. Shit.
3430000	3434000	Fucking PCs nowadays can emulate the goddamn Wii U at 60 frames per second.
3434000	3436000	Let's be thankful for what we're getting.
3436000	3442000	No, I am not. It's just, what we're complacent is when they're like, oh, fuck it, we don't have to do it because they don't care anymore.
3442000	3449000	That's why Microsoft is fucking working on this shit. No, fuck that. I am not happy with not being able to play these things.
3449000	3454000	And also not happy with the fact that I do own these PlayStation 2 games or whatever on the PlayStation 3.
3454000	3462000	Oh, but I'm sorry. That's a separate purchase from the PlayStation 2 games that run on the PlayStation 4 or some bullshit. I don't know.
3462000	3467000	So we have a chatter over at live.vognetware.com called, come on, NullGus.
3467000	3472000	Come on, NullGus, who says, there's no shame in your games, Sky.
3473000	3479000	I want to watch Garrett Hedlung in a skin tight suit in 3D. 3D. I've been drinking a little bit.
3479000	3483000	Yeah, sure. Thanks. Sure.
3483000	3487000	Real quick, there was another game that they announced some more improvements for.
3487000	3492000	Fallout 4 is going to be getting an update on PC and PlayStation 4 Pro.
3492000	3502000	Pro with the 1.19 patch, they're going to be getting tweaks to lighting and textures are going to be supported at a native 1440p.
3502000	3507000	And they're improving the draw distance and God Ray effects for PC.
3507000	3515000	They're having a high resolution texture pack, which is 58 gigabytes of brand new textures that are even more high res.
3515000	3517000	Enjoy that download.
3517000	3522000	Yikes. I'm sure Alan will download it. If his computer will run it. I don't know.
3522000	3525000	You might have to have like a state of the art thing to run that.
3525000	3526000	Can I get a 4K monitor?
3526000	3529000	Yeah, that's true. He doesn't really have all that 4K fancy stuff.
3529000	3532000	I did buy him a new monitor, but I don't think that the video card goes that far.
3532000	3534000	But that still sounds cool.
3534000	3538000	Yeah, I'm looking forward to that. So no word on when the rest of us get the update.
3538000	3542000	Hopefully soon. I mean, if it's in beta right now, I'm guessing.
3542000	3543000	Maybe a month.
3543000	3545000	Right around the Switch launch.
3545000	3548000	Ooh, right around the time for Mass Effect Andromeda. That'd be nice.
3548000	3549000	When's that coming out? Is it March?
3549000	3550000	End of March.
3550000	3551000	End of March.
3551000	3553000	So, that'd be nice.
3553000	3559000	Even though Mass Effect Andromeda kind of natively embraces the Pro, that's one of the games they've been showing off for it.
3559000	3561000	How much was the Switch again? Was that $299?
3561000	3562000	That's $299.
3562000	3563000	$299.
3563000	3566000	You're thinking about going back, aren't you?
3566000	3570000	No, I'm not. I was just thinking the Pro being $399.
3570000	3577000	That's like, well actually PlayStation would be $299. It's like, why? I don't know.
3577000	3581000	Alright, well moving on. Here's a story about Nintendo and Animal Crossing.
3581000	3584000	Animal Crossing is supposed to be getting a mobile game soon.
3584000	3588000	I think a lot of people have been checking out that Fire Emblem Heroes that came out on mobile.
3588000	3591000	I passed. I didn't check it out.
3591000	3594000	I actually, here's the thing.
3594000	3598000	I'm not really super into the Fire Emblem series as it is.
3598000	3602000	Like the whole permadeath and the fact that the strategy, tactical thing.
3602000	3605000	I'm just not like super duper into those types of games.
3605000	3607000	That's cool for people that are, yay.
3607000	3608000	But I've never really been into it.
3608000	3614000	But I thought maybe the Fire Emblem mobile thing could be like, okay, well if it's free, maybe this would be something that introduces me to it.
3614000	3618000	And then I heard, because I started seeing all these screenshots on Twitter the day it came out.
3618000	3620000	It was all, add me, here's my code.
3620000	3622000	And on Facebook, add me, here's my code.
3622000	3626000	And I'm thinking in the back of my head, this fucking game has friend codes?
3626000	3634000	It doesn't just, it doesn't just tie to your Facebook or tie to your Twitter account like most mobile games these days now do.
3634000	3636000	Or your My Nintendo account that doesn't have friends with it.
3636000	3639000	Yes, the whole reason why I thought they were doing these in the first place.
3639000	3642000	The My Nintendo account is supposed to link to that.
3642000	3644000	Nope, none of that.
3644000	3652000	And look, I know that some mobile games have used codes in the past, but either I'm just not playing enough mobile games, but I don't see them recently anymore.
3652000	3654000	Like I'm looking at the games I am playing.
3654000	3658000	Fuck, Super Mario Run used it, used Facebook and Twitter.
3658000	3661000	Non-Stop Night I'm still playing, that uses that.
3661000	3664000	Final Fantasy XVS is on Facebook.
3664000	3667000	Miitomo fucking uses Facebook and Twitter.
3667000	3672000	Like, I don't, like friend codes are fucking ten years ago. Bye.
3672000	3678000	I'm so shocked that there's some online thing that Nintendo's not getting.
3678000	3682000	Well, I'm sure they'll have that all ironed out in about four weeks, right?
3682000	3684000	I'm sure that'll be all taken care of.
3684000	3688000	Fifth Dream in chat is pointing out permadeath can be turned off.
3688000	3692000	Yeah, I heard that about the mobile game, which is part of what, honestly, had made that more appealing.
3692000	3698000	But you know what? I don't have to go suck on the tit of everything that Nintendo puts out.
3698000	3700000	I just don't.
3700000	3702000	So, you know what? This one's a pass from me.
3702000	3711000	If people just, if, man, I go to parties and everybody's sitting on their phone playing the game and like, Rob, you have to fucking play this and all this stuff, maybe I'll change my mind.
3711000	3714000	But at this point, I'm not really seeing it. Beyond.
3714000	3717000	No, I don't have to fucking play this. What are you doing with your life?
3719000	3723000	Unless that game that they're playing on their phone is the Jackbox Party Pack?
3723000	3726000	No, somebody who plays Ingress, not allowed to say that to anybody.
3726000	3729000	Hey, I don't play it that much, okay?
3729000	3738000	Now, I'm not saying that I may have stayed up looking at a map on, you know, a computer talking to people over, you know, the internet, telling them where to go.
3738000	3744000	That may not be a thing I did, but you know what? Seriously, though.
3744000	3750000	I hit level 27 in Pokemon Go this week, though, so you can't say I'm not supporting Nintendo in one way or another.
3750000	3754000	Although, you know, how much money does Nintendo really get from that game?
3754000	3759000	They get a cut, I'm sure, but probably not as much as Pokemon Company and Niantic.
3759000	3763000	Still not getting enough money to fix all the spoofing, cheating problems.
3763000	3769000	Yeah, well anyway, if you were looking forward, the whole point of this, if you were looking forward to Animal Crossing on mobile, it's delayed.
3769000	3775000	They're just saying it's bumped to the next fiscal year, but to be fair, that is just April or later.
3775000	3783000	So, I guess at one point they had guaranteed it for this fiscal year, or you know, said it would be this fiscal year, but they're bumping it back a little further.
3783000	3789000	I had always thought this was dated for just calendar year 2018, so I wasn't completely disappointed by this.
3789000	3798000	It could be that they're just not either ready with it, or maybe they just want to bump it so that they're, you know, not putting all their money into this quarter or year or something like that.
3798000	3805000	Well, let's also not forget Super Mario Run still hasn't shown up on Android, so that's something they probably want to get out before the end of March.
3805000	3808000	Well, they probably are. I think it's supposed to come out in March.
3808000	3811000	Did they announce it already? They did put a date on that, yeah, yeah.
3811000	3817000	So, anyway, Animal Crossing, we'll just have to wait a little longer. I probably will check that out on mobile.
3817000	3826000	I mean, I just, Lord help me if they don't figure out how to get on Facebook, Twitter, or my Nintendo would be just fine to link to other people.
3826000	3828000	Man, the microtransactions.
3828000	3831000	If a friend code shows up in Animal Crossing, so help me God.
3831000	3834000	The microtransactions in that game are going to be fucking off the chain.
3834000	3845000	I, uh, you know what, if the microtransactions are the classic NES games, like in the original Animal Crossing, which is part of what made that game so fucking desirable and great,
3845000	3850000	which is also why we'll probably never see it on Virtual Console, the GameCube version.
3850000	3851000	God no, yeah.
3851000	3855000	I would be here for that in a heartbeat. They could charge a little money for that.
3855000	3856000	Exactly.
3856000	3859000	Although, those games would not be fun to play on touch screen only.
3859000	3870000	Maybe something like Clue Clue Land or Balloon Fight or some of the ridiculously simple ones, the controls aren't that serious, but like Mario Brothers and Zelda, that would not be fun at all.
3870000	3872000	Not be fun at all.
3872000	3885000	Let's see, Ragenator in chat says, with the next Nintendo game, not only will you need to use friend codes, but you'll have to solve Resident Evil style puzzles, solve Einstein's field equations, translate War and Peace into Aramic in order to add friends, Sky.
3885000	3888000	Yeah, sounds about right. Sounds about right.
3888000	3892000	Dark Sakura, take me to some more pleasant news in gaming.
3892000	3895000	We've been also playing another thing at my house.
3895000	3898000	Now, I didn't mention this because I know it was a story.
3898000	3902000	Mega Man 2.5D remake. Have you seen it?
3902000	3904000	Capcom put out another Mega Man game?
3904000	3905000	No.
3905000	3906000	What?
3906000	3907000	This is a fan game.
3907000	3908000	Oh.
3908000	3916000	Basically, it really is a 2.5D game that kind of tilts and rotates, but it's still mostly 2D.
3916000	3921000	Except it does some weird tilting when you're climbing up or down things.
3921000	3927000	And you'll go alongside and then the screen will stop and rotate and then you go onto the next part of the stage.
3927000	3929000	Is it a remake of one of the older games or is it like a new one?
3929000	3932000	It's a combination, basically.
3932000	3933000	Oh.
3933000	3944000	The people behind it did, like, it's got different bosses in it. Like, it's got Quick Man, Snake Man, Splash Woman.
3944000	3946000	So, it's a big combination.
3946000	3948000	Well, they kind of did a hodgepodge from different games.
3948000	3950000	And you can play as Proto Man.
3951000	3958000	And also, yes, it's got Shadow Man in it and who was the Pharaoh looking one? I don't remember who he was.
3958000	3959000	Pharaoh Man?
3959000	3961000	Pharaoh Man. Pharaoh Man!
3961000	3967000	But you can also, it has co-op and versus in it. So, it's pretty neat.
3967000	3972000	It's pretty difficult too, though, but it seems like it's a lot of fun.
3972000	3974000	And that's Mega Man 2.5D.
3974000	3976000	Alright.
3976000	3979000	By the way, I think it has been taken down off of the site.
3979000	3980000	What a shock.
3980000	3983000	That would be wrong because I am currently downloading it.
3983000	3988000	Good. I had to get mine from the torrent link because the other ones were down.
3988000	3991000	Once on the internet, though, always on the internet.
3991000	3992000	Yep.
3992000	3994000	Alright.
3994000	3997000	Alright, well, let's move on with some more news. Just a couple, oh, yeah.
3997000	4005000	I forgot one thing. If you go on the guy's site and look at the art assets, they totally did a US style one that is so bad.
4005000	4006000	Oh, like the box art?
4006000	4008000	For cover art, right? It's terrible bad.
4009000	4014000	I have to check that out. Yeah, I really need to. I want to check that out, hopefully before they take it down.
4014000	4018000	But even if they take it down, I can just get it off Loki's computer.
4018000	4022000	Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys than the classic game of the week. But first, Loki.
4022000	4026000	So, remember that thing that they were showing off at E3 2014?
4026000	4032000	I remember Miyamoto had some concepts that he was working on. One of those was Project Giant Robot.
4032000	4036000	And remember how he said it looked like crap? Well, they cancelled it.
4038000	4045000	So, they're not working on it anymore. Probably makes sense because it was a Wii U concept and they're not making anything for the Wii U anymore.
4045000	4055000	So, since it's not going to translate, I would think you maybe need that second screen for something that probably makes sense that you wouldn't have that on the Switch.
4057000	4060000	Sucks for those people that wanted to play the game. Not me, I'm not one of them.
4060000	4065000	And I'm hoping that means that, oh, wait, no, that Project Guard did end up being some shitty mini game.
4065000	4067000	It was the Star Fox thing, wasn't it?
4068000	4075000	But, yeah, that was a weird E3. Like, where Nintendo kind of had to justify the Wii U.
4075000	4080000	So, they were like, Miyamoto, convince everybody the Wii U gamepad's a good idea.
4081000	4083000	And that was what you got.
4085000	4089000	So, alright, well, it's something you're never going to play again.
4089000	4095000	So, you would think they'd at least maybe put out the demo as a free piece of software. Just throw us a bone somewhere.
4095000	4102000	The cancelled game stuff is always weird to me. Anyway, Stoppy in Chat says over at live.fognetwork.com,
4102000	4107000	I'm so sad about that. It seemed to be the closest we could get to a RAD successor.
4108000	4112000	Well, let's talk about Retro Studios. What are they working on?
4112000	4116000	Well, they're dropping some hints that it might be Metroid Prime.
4116000	4118000	Now, this could be stretching a little bit.
4118000	4122000	And it all went down on Twitter where there was a tweet that went out to Retro Studios that said,
4122000	4126000	Hey Retro Studios, what game are you making? We old people want to know.
4126000	4131000	Well, the interesting thing is Retro Studios replied and said, we're making something delicious.
4131000	4133000	And they replied with a picture.
4133000	4136000	And the picture is like of a delicious looking dinner.
4136000	4141000	I mean, Loki, look at that meat arrangement there. Doesn't that look amazing? Yes.
4141000	4143000	Well, here's the interesting thing about it.
4143000	4148000	That's some prime steak you're looking at there. Some prime meats.
4148000	4152000	So people are reading that as confirmed Metroid Prime.
4152000	4155000	That might be a little bit of a stretch, but there you go.
4155000	4157000	That's stretching it a bit.
4159000	4163000	It'd be different if like, no, they can't put like a picture of a Metroid in the picture.
4163000	4167000	Or they're making a game called like Ham and Chili. I don't know.
4167000	4169000	Chili Prime. Ooh, Chili Prime.
4170000	4172000	It's on an ice planet.
4173000	4178000	I would think that would be the type of thing Nintendo would bring to E3 if that is certainly a thing that's happening.
4178000	4180000	But we'll find out.
4180000	4184000	This has been a while. Did we talk about, there was another Metroid fan game that I saw that came out.
4184000	4187000	Like Metroid Zero or something like that that someone put out.
4187000	4190000	I don't think it came up on the show. The last one I remember was the AM2R.
4190000	4193000	Yeah, this is a brand new one. This is like a Metroid Zero.
4193000	4196000	Oh yeah, I did hear about this. Somebody took like Metroid Zero.
4196000	4202000	Yeah, it's like a ROM hack and they try to expand on the story before even like Metroid Zero, right?
4202000	4204000	So that looked cool.
4204000	4207000	Yeah, and something else to look out for and download.
4207000	4208000	Yep.
4208000	4214000	Alright, well let's talk about those classics. Games like Metroid that will forever be etched in our memory.
4214000	4217000	That's why we do a segment like this called the Classic Game of the Week.
4217000	4224000	Where every week Dark Sakura jumps into the gaming vault head first, swims through her piles and piles of games.
4224000	4225000	It's sticky.
4225000	4233000	And pulls out one game from the rubble that she declares, this is the game that you all should be playing this week or you are literal garbage.
4233000	4235000	Yes, garbage.
4235000	4242000	Just kidding. But you should still respect the Classic Game of the Week and this one I must say, one of my all time favorites too.
4242000	4244000	This is a good one. This is a good one.
4244000	4246000	What is the Classic Game of the Week, Dark Sakura?
4246000	4250000	From way back in 2003.
4250000	4252000	Meaning 10 years or older. 14 years.
4252000	4253000	14 years old.
4253000	4254000	Yep.
4254000	4260000	Is WarioWare Inc. Mega Microgames. With a dollar sign. Bam!
4260000	4263000	In Japan it was called Made in Wario.
4263000	4269000	And in PAL it was WarioWare Inc. Minigame Mania.
4269000	4274000	This came out on the Game Boy Advance back in Le Day.
4274000	4280000	And it was the first of the WarioWare game series.
4280000	4286000	So basically, it's all minigames. Just teeny tiny microgames.
4286000	4293000	And they're only a few seconds, but in each of these little games you have to control it of course with your D-Pad and your A-Button.
4293000	4301000	And you have to figure out what you're supposed to do based on a word or phrase that appears and then you get all the conditions you have to finish.
4302000	4311000	You sometimes have to shoot targets, you have multiple choice answers, or you just have to make it through a timer.
4311000	4315000	So you start with four lives and the game ends when you lose all your lives.
4315000	4321000	For the main game you go through all the levels either as Wario or one of his buddies.
4321000	4330000	And then some of them are nature games or puzzle games and some of them are based on Nintendo games.
4330000	4337000	So as you go through them the time goes down more and more until you have to beat them really quickly.
4337000	4341000	And then you also have different boss encounters as you go through.
4341000	4347000	So really it's just minigames. It's fun little crazy minigames.
4347000	4351000	And I have to read the plot because this is great.
4352000	4361000	While at home one evening Wario turns on his TV to see a special report on video game sales going up all due to popular games like Pioro.
4361000	4368000	After thinking for a few seconds Wario realizes that video games may be a potential goldmine for him.
4368000	4373000	The next morning he rushes out and buys a laptop computer and immediately gets to work.
4373000	4378000	He starts making games but when realizing it takes hard work he calls his friends to come and make some games.
4378000	4382000	Thus WarioWare Inc. is formed with Wario as president of the company.
4382000	4389000	Basically Wario makes all of his friends make games and he takes the money for himself.
4389000	4404000	Complete with his cast of characters Wario, Jimmy T, Mona, Dribble and Spitz, 9 Volt, Orbulan, Dr. Crygor, and Cat and Anna.
4405000	4412000	The game has been very popular. It has spawned other versions of itself.
4412000	4418000	Game Informer in 2008 said it was one of the top 10 weirdest games of all time.
4418000	4424000	So for other versions that came out on the GameCube it was WarioWare Inc. Mega Party Games.
4424000	4428000	In Japan it was Atsumare Made in Wario.
4429000	4437000	There were the DSiWare games Paper Plane and Pyoto which are part of the DSiWare digital service.
4443000	4446000	And then we also had re-releases for Virtual Console.
4446000	4449000	And that's it. WarioWare.
4449000	4453000	One of my very favorites. I love this game. It's so fun.
4453000	4460000	I love the classic NES games parts where it's like you just do one little thing from the classic games.
4460000	4464000	I love that the best. I think a lot of people who played WarioWare probably enjoy that.
4464000	4468000	It just made me think if he hired all of his friends to make those games.
4468000	4472000	I bet some of his friends are like, I just lost interest here, it ends here.
4472000	4474000	Put it on a timer. Who cares.
4474000	4478000	Alright there it is your classic game of the week. WarioWare Inc.
4478000	4481000	The Microgames. One of my all time favorites.
4481000	4485000	Alright we are going to take a break but we have plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come after the break.
4485000	4487000	Including some rapid fire news.
4487000	4491000	Your emails at participate at orangesloungeradio.com and your calls.
4491000	4494000	Orange Lounge Radio. All one word on Skype.
4494000	4498000	When we come back after this break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4498000	4500000	Don't go anywhere.
4500000	4510000	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight.
4510000	4514000	On this historical episode number 674.
4514000	4517000	February the 5th of 2017. Historical.
4517000	4520000	No wait that's the Super Bowl because apparently they are in overtime.
4520000	4522000	No wonder nobody is listening tonight.
4522000	4526000	Just kidding. We appreciate those of you faithful that are still here showing up.
4526000	4529000	Live in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
4529000	4534000	It's about time for us to get into some rapid fire news. Take it away Loki.
4534000	4540000	Alright so there is a brand new shooter that's coming to Playstation VR.
4540000	4542000	Next week actually.
4542000	4546000	Called Dexed. It's being developed by Ninja Theory.
4546000	4550000	And it looks pretty cool. It's kind of like a Panzer Dragoon style game.
4550000	4553000	So that will come out for 10 bucks.
4553000	4558000	Actually I'm sorry that I already came out. So that was apparently last Tuesday.
4558000	4562000	I'll have to try that out. I've been looking for more Playstation VR stuff.
4562000	4563000	So cool.
4563000	4565000	Does it give you a headache at all?
4565000	4570000	No. The only thing that gives me a headache is.
4570000	4573000	I don't know if I try to like lay. Like you know how they with the Playstation VR.
4573000	4578000	They're like oh yeah you can lay back and watch like movies and stuff like that.
4578000	4583000	You can't lay on that because there's like a bar in the back there.
4583000	4585000	Oh that sounds annoying.
4585000	4588000	So that would really put a kink in your neck.
4588000	4592000	Anyways so this is kind of cool. There's another ROM hack.
4592000	4597000	Now remember we talked about how they put Bubsy into Streets of Rage.
4597000	4603000	Well now this is a little less weird. They put Darkwing Duck into DuckTales 2.
4603000	4608000	So yes you can actually play as Darkwing Duck.
4608000	4614000	And apparently they hacked the two player mode and one of the players is now Darkwing Duck.
4614000	4616000	Does he flap in the night?
4616000	4617000	Probably.
4617000	4618000	I love Darkwing Duck.
4618000	4621000	So yeah if you want to check that out you can go to ROMhacking.net. Check it out.
4621000	4626000	Cool. Well I have something that's a little bit more.
4626000	4633000	I would say that's been talked about on the last show because I was going to talk about it.
4633000	4644000	But there's something a little bit more about the I guess political action behind the character Diva from Overwatch.
4644000	4651000	And that we've seen for some of the protesting that was going on in Korea as well.
4651000	4661000	That they rallied behind Diva and her little rabbit mascot as you know a rallying cry.
4661000	4671000	But it also came in because of a girl who was pretty much so good at Overwatch that the men accused her of cheating.
4671000	4678000	And just went from there as being I guess a source of pride overall.
4678000	4686000	But now there's a lot more rallying I guess with Diva's little rabbit mascot.
4686000	4692000	They were even protesting against in the women's march.
4692000	4695000	They were in the women's march that happened in Seoul.
4695000	4701000	And I just think it's amazing. It makes me just want to get nothing but shirts with angry rabbits on them.
4701000	4703000	I think I'm going to do that now.
4703000	4708000	And then in other news for those of us who are fans of Mass Effect.
4708000	4714000	For Andromeda you get a 10 hour trial of Andromeda 5 days before launch.
4714000	4718000	But that is only if you are an access subscriber.
4718000	4723000	So that will be out on March 16th.
4723000	4727000	And the game is going to be out on March 21st.
4727000	4730000	Gonna be mine. Gonna be mine.
4730000	4732000	So it's like you get to play it early.
4732000	4735000	Yeah. And then you have to wait. And then play it some more.
4735000	4738000	It's gonna be mine.
4738000	4741000	I don't know if you know this. Is it going to be a piece from the actual game?
4741000	4743000	Or is it going to be a separate demo?
4743000	4744000	It doesn't say.
4744000	4745000	Boo.
4745000	4750000	But I've already decided that when I make my character she's going to be Kamen Rider.
4750000	4752000	Now it works.
4752000	4756000	Mine's going to be Richard Rider and I'll let you fill in the gaps.
4756000	4761000	Alright. Moving on. Let's talk about Final Fantasy 15.
4761000	4765000	Remember how everybody hated Chapter 13? Well at least I did. So that means everybody.
4765000	4768000	I haven't gotten to Chapter 13 because I haven't played it anymore.
4768000	4769000	Everyone didn't bother.
4769000	4771000	All you need to do is wait until March 28th.
4771000	4776000	Because the promised changes to Chapter 13 will be occurring on March 28th.
4776000	4780000	That is also by the way the same day as the Gladio DLC will be coming.
4780000	4782000	That has also been dated for March 28th.
4782000	4784000	What is my VR DLC coming?
4784000	4786000	That has not been dated.
4786000	4790000	But it is interesting because it seems like they're kind of doing something to change the game every month.
4790000	4797000	They're doing little updates. Like they had the Chocobo Moogle Festival in January which I didn't think was very good at all.
4797000	4804000	Like I heard Bobby showing. I know he liked it. I didn't like it at all. I thought it was kind of lame thing that they threw it put in there.
4804000	4809000	Did you see the not Power Rangers costume thing that they're supposed to be doing?
4809000	4811000	And there's February's thing that they're putting in there.
4811000	4816000	Yeah it's like oh yeah we didn't put it out because it was too similar to the Power Rangers. Yeah no shit.
4816000	4818000	And there isn't a Power Rangers movie about to hit theaters or anything.
4818000	4820000	No not at all.
4820000	4822000	They'll be selling Cup Noodle at the movie theaters.
4822000	4824000	Cup Noodle.
4824000	4826000	Anyway.
4826000	4833000	But you know what I'm looking forward very much to the Gladio DLC and exploring that and so the Chapter 13.
4833000	4838000	I don't know if I want to go back and re-experience Chapter 13 but I kind of feel like I have to.
4838000	4842000	But maybe that's one of those things I can just watch a YouTube right Logie?
4842000	4844000	I'll watch you play it on YouTube or something.
4844000	4846000	Yeah right like we're streaming.
4846000	4854000	A little bit of sad news this week. A moment please to remember Masaya Nakamura who passed away this week at the age of 91.
4854000	4859000	A lot of outlets misreporting that he's the creator of Pac-Man.
4859000	4862000	No Masaya Nakamura was not the creator of Pac-Man.
4862000	4869000	But he's tied to Pac-Man because he was the founder of Namco in the year 1955.
4869000	4873000	So actually he passed away on January 22nd.
4873000	4881000	But the news of his passing was given out after the Waken funeral with close relatives was already held.
4881000	4883000	That was all at the request of his family.
4883000	4889000	So yes he founded Namco Games who's brought us a lot of great stuff over the years.
4889000	4892000	Unfortunately he passed away this week.
4892000	4895000	But 91 good number. Very good number.
4895000	4897000	So great guy for gaming.
4897000	4901000	Alright let's travel around and check out what is in stores this week.
4901000	4902000	Logie?
4902000	4904000	There's a whole ton of stuff coming out this week.
4904000	4907000	I'm kind of surprised because February is usually a little bit busier.
4907000	4912000	But this week we have Altier Sophie the Alchemist of the Mysterious Book on PC.
4912000	4915000	Knights of Xur on PC.
4915000	4918000	Neo coming out in PlayStation 4. That's a pretty big one.
4918000	4921000	And Splasher on PC.
4921000	4926000	Finally the port of WWE 2K17 also out on PC. That is it.
4927000	4933000	And Rob is choking.
4933000	4934000	Sorry.
4934000	4936000	Please don't die Rob. We kind of need you.
4936000	4941000	I'm trying to do that thing where I eat in between talking so I'm not chewing and talking to you guys.
4941000	4944000	But yeah I almost choked on what I was eating there.
4944000	4947000	Yeah those things where it slowly goes down your throat.
4947000	4950000	Yeah well there's nothing you can do. It feels like you're choking for the longest time.
4950000	4952000	I'm also eating toast with peanut butter.
4952000	4956000	So it's kind of like you know sometimes if you try to swallow that too fast it's like rargh.
4956000	4958000	So anyway.
4958000	4963000	Let's talk about what's coming out in Japan this week on the PlayStation 4.
4963000	4968000	So this week we have on February the 9th.
4968000	4974000	Four Goddesses Online Cyber Dimension Neptune comes out in Irregular and Royal Edition.
4974000	4976000	Neptuneia.
4976000	4980000	Sengoku Musou 4-2 gets a price reduction that's already been out.
4980000	4984000	But it's going to be a price reduction into the best collection over there.
4985000	4987000	And that's honestly really it.
4987000	4992000	That Four Goddesses Online Cyber Dimension Neptune is really the biggest release on the PlayStation 4 this week.
4992000	4995000	It does not appear that that carries over to the Vita.
4995000	4999000	Vita is actually dry this week in Japan. Usually there's a ton of stuff.
4999000	5001000	But not this week.
5001000	5009000	However on the Nintendo 3DS there is Dragon Quest Monsters Joker 3 Professional that is out this week.
5009000	5012000	So a lot of folks really into Dragon Quest and spinoff games.
5012000	5014000	So I'm sure folks will be checking that out.
5014000	5016000	But that's really it as far as Japan is concerned.
5016000	5017000	How about Europe DarkSakura?
5017000	5019000	Jack shit.
5019000	5021000	Really that's it.
5021000	5023000	Alright.
5023000	5025000	Then let's go to the mailbag.
5025000	5027000	Well DarkSakura we got to make you do some work.
5027000	5030000	So let's get to our mailbag.
5030000	5032000	Every week you guys send us emails.
5032000	5035000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
5035000	5038000	DarkSakura dives in the mailbag head first and pulls out an email.
5038000	5040000	Thanks. Hey.
5040000	5042000	This is worth reading on air.
5042000	5043000	Yep.
5043000	5045000	So DarkSakura what is in the email bag this week?
5045000	5047000	Just one to catch up on from the missed show last week.
5047000	5049000	Only one worth reading.
5049000	5050000	Fair enough.
5050000	5051000	Hello LR.
5051000	5058000	Last week you guys discussed the rumored possibility that Nintendo Switch will lack Netflix, Hulu and other streaming apps.
5058000	5064000	Plus we already know that Nintendo will be offering features such as voice chat and matchmaking through smartphone apps.
5064000	5071000	I believe the real issue here is that Nintendo is potentially failing to understand the importance of an entertainment ecosystem.
5071000	5075000	As a console manufacturer you want to keep folks engaged in your ecosystem.
5075000	5077000	Excuse me.
5077000	5084000	For example Microsoft wants you to spend as much time on your Xbox One as possible regardless of whether you're actually playing games on it.
5084000	5089000	After all the more time you spend there the more likely it is that you'll make purchases on Xbox One.
5089000	5097000	If I shut it down and turn on my PS4 instead that means I'll be spending time and possibly money in Sony's ecosystem rather than Microsoft's.
5097000	5103000	If Nintendo fails to provide streaming apps they are discouraging folks from staying within their ecosystem.
5103000	5111000	But even worse is the fact that they are actually sending folks to other ecosystems by providing Switch related features on iOS and Android platforms.
5111000	5118000	I mean since you're now in front of your phone anyway you may as well check on your mobile games, social media, messaging apps and so on.
5118000	5121000	Many of which allow you to spend money somewhere else.
5121000	5125000	I must say I'm not quite sure if this is their best possible strategy.
5125000	5129000	Can I just commend YYR that is a really good way of putting it honestly.
5129000	5138000	Like that is a really good way of putting like where my because you know last week there was a lot of you guys that disagreed with me on the whole Netflix saying like the system doesn't need Netflix.
5138000	5146000	But I'm just kind of like I just still think they are making a huge mistake and I think YYR really put words there to what I was thinking.
5146000	5149000	At least I'm going to claim that's what I was thinking because that was a really good argument. Thank you.
5149000	5152000	Rob you also mentioned Project Diva Future Tone.
5152000	5162000	Yes the price tag is off putting at first but I spent over $80 on just the two base packs for the identical Japanese release and I can say this much.
5162000	5168000	If you will actually play it for the many many hours of entertainment it can provide it is absolutely worth every penny.
5168000	5175000	The list of over 200 songs spans the entire series and not much is left out plus the note charts are all unique to this version.
5175000	5184000	I will mention that the DLC is coming some content including new songs and additional charts for existing songs was added to the arcade version after the PS4 version came out.
5184000	5187000	The DLC brings the PS4 version up to date.
5187000	5195000	If you want all of it is $25 bringing the grand total for everything to $79.
5195000	5202000	Once again if you are enough of a fan that you will actually play this thing for the hundred plus hours of fun it will provide it's still worth it.
5202000	5210000	Considering how good of a value it actually is I'm not sure when or if they'll put it on sale. I already own the Japanese version as well.
5210000	5212000	It's Sega it'll go on sale.
5212000	5223000	So I wasn't in much of a rush to buy the American release but what I plan to do is wait for another one of Sony's spend $100 get 15 or similar PSN promotions to get a pseudo discount.
5223000	5225000	So if you're still on the fence you could do that as well.
5226000	5234000	Not a bad idea. I feel like YYR should be the official legal counsel of OLR. He's made some good arguments tonight.
5234000	5237000	I mean I know he's not actually a lawyer but neither are we.
5237000	5242000	Lastly thanks for having me. I feel like one fucking lately.
5242000	5244000	Oh a lawyer?
5244000	5246000	I will pause for just a moment.
5246000	5251000	My mother reads the stupid red sites that are nothing but you know bullshit.
5251000	5252000	Clickbait.
5252000	5257000	Yeah but they literally are full of lies. I've gone on her page and looked at this shit.
5257000	5259000	Like the whole Gaga is going to do a satanic ritual today.
5259000	5260000	Whatever.
5260000	5262000	I was actually sad she didn't.
5262000	5274000	So I have actually been going on like and pulling like legal records and cases and shit to say here's where what you just said was wrong.
5274000	5275000	Doesn't matter.
5275000	5276000	I know.
5276000	5281000	To be fair it happens on the other side too. It just seems to be happening more often lately.
5281000	5282000	My mom doesn't know how to do it.
5282000	5283000	I know.
5283000	5285000	She's like well it's on the national news. What national news?
5285000	5286000	Fox News.
5286000	5291000	Anyway lastly thanks for having Matt Baum on the show last week.
5291000	5297000	The interview was really interesting and now I'm going to be giving the Defining Marriage podcast a shot.
5297000	5300000	I was not aware that he had also published a book by the same name.
5300000	5301000	He did.
5301000	5306000	Thanks as always for being awesome. Have a great week. Lots of hugs Aaron YYR.
5307000	5314000	I hope you tweeted that at Matt and anybody who enjoyed him on the show last time tweet him and say you enjoyed the interview.
5314000	5320000	Because you know that helps people know that OLR is a great place to come pitch your story.
5320000	5323000	Did someone send an email about Kigurumi?
5323000	5325000	Yeah it was the week you were gone.
5325000	5332000	Oh and you know what I actually was wrong about games because I was looking in January and it's February.
5332000	5336000	Oh so you want to go back and alter your UK releases?
5336000	5342000	Yeah hold on. Because when you link them to me you're always giving me like September 2016.
5342000	5345000	Oh sorry. Oh so now it's my fault.
5345000	5346000	Yes it is your fault.
5346000	5347000	Now it's my fault. You know what?
5347000	5348000	Girl.
5348000	5350000	Those were just the alternative release dates.
5350000	5351000	The alternative. Okay.
5351000	5359000	On the 7th is Fallout Shelter for Xbox One and the 9th is Neo for Playstation 4 and IOH. That's it.
5359000	5365000	Which is apparently one of those like hard as hell kind of games. Like Dark Souls but like at 11.
5365000	5374000	Which you know Dark Souls is nightmare enough. I was watching, I didn't play it myself but I was watching someone play Dark Souls 3 this weekend.
5374000	5375000	Did you poop?
5375000	5376000	What?
5376000	5377000	Did you poop?
5377000	5380000	Well yes but not because of the game.
5382000	5384000	Everybody does Dark Sakura.
5384000	5386000	I have a book about that you know.
5386000	5387000	Yes I know I know.
5387000	5390000	By the way I found my copy of Come Out Squirtle.
5390000	5393000	Did you? Mine's over here in the...
5393000	5394000	Yep.
5394000	5397000	It's next to my video games for some weird reason.
5397000	5398000	How apropro.
5398000	5409000	Alright let's move on. We gotta get to some other news stories and then your calls at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
5409000	5410000	Loki.
5410000	5417000	Alright so we finally got some news regarding the whole online service for the Nintendo Switch.
5417000	5419000	They've come out with the pricing for it.
5419000	5427000	So they're saying that the annual cost is going to be between 2000 and 3000 yen or approximately 1760 to 2640 a year.
5427000	5433000	And they're also saying that they're considering adding virtual reality as an option for the Switch.
5433000	5437000	I really don't see that happening at least with this device.
5438000	5445000	And but if they're able to resolve the issues of discomfort of VR over multiple hours.
5445000	5451000	Let's put it this way. That system is not the dimensions nor is it the resolution for VR.
5451000	5453000	I just don't see that happening.
5453000	5455000	I just don't.
5455000	5462000	Maybe phones can do it but it won't be anything better than like the Samsung Gear VR or something like that.
5464000	5466000	What do you think of that lower price though?
5467000	5472000	I have to see what we're getting with that. It doesn't matter what the price is. The fact that they pay anything for it.
5472000	5474000	What am I getting with that?
5474000	5477000	Well I'm glad at least based on what we're hearing so far.
5477000	5487000	Because I think we did kind of rant a little bit two weeks ago about what the hell are we going to be paying 60 bucks a month for if we're not really getting something that's equal to 60 a year.
5487000	5489000	Or sorry 60 a year not a month.
5489000	5496000	But you know it's nice to hear that okay even though it does sound like it's going to be a rental as opposed to a purchase.
5496000	5503000	It's still not okay. I think that's stupid. I think it's stupid. Don't even give it out if you're going to just take it right back.
5503000	5513000	I think if anything they should at least give you one virtual console game. I mean they've made their money on these games a long time ago.
5513000	5521000	There is no value being lost there to them. I mean but they're just greedy and want more money for those virtual console games.
5521000	5527000	They've made millions of dollars for them. You know several millions of dollars for them each one.
5527000	5535000	So there's no point in not being able to give that at least even if you're going to say okay we're only going to do one game.
5535000	5539000	One virtual console game a month. It's still better than nothing.
5539000	5544000	And we still don't know what exactly feature wise is going to be available with this.
5544000	5551000	So even if it was like say $24 a year say $2 a month. What am I getting with that.
5551000	5555000	That's what I want to know is like show me something that's actually going to be valuable here.
5555000	5562000	Like how is right now Nintendo's track record with networking has not been good.
5562000	5567000	I mean look we just talked about it not too long ago that they're still doing friend codes in like one of their games.
5567000	5570000	They can't even get a service like they have.
5570000	5576000	They can't get the marketplaces to talk to each other you know like your purchases on the Wii U aren't transferring over to the Wii U.
5576000	5580000	And you know that you'd have to pay an upgrade fee for that. Fuck that.
5580000	5587000	It shouldn't be happening. If you bought it a virtual console game on one system it should be able to just unlock for free in the other one.
5587000	5595000	I mean Sony's guilty for this as well with the PlayStation 2 stuff. At least their excuse is that oh we have to create an emulator for it and all that stuff.
5595000	5602000	But I don't know I still want to get more details regarding what exactly I'm getting for that kind of money.
5602000	5607000	And also that you know for me it doesn't really make much of a difference right now because I don't have the system.
5607000	5616000	But if they're launching with a partial feature set there's there's no like streaming apps there's a lot of stuff missing that's just staples with other platforms.
5616000	5621000	And you got to be on par with those other platforms I would think if you want to have a comparable product.
5621000	5629000	And you can't just say well we're just not competing so that's how we get away with it. Fuck that. You're in the marketplace. You're competing.
5629000	5636000	We'll see what it looks like on holiday. I don't know. I'm not rehashing this again. Let's move on.
5636000	5643000	Okay so we have to talk about something and you know there's a lot of politics going on in the world.
5643000	5648000	And I know some of you listen to OLR to escape politics to talk about video games here.
5648000	5654000	But the reality is some stuff is going on in the world that is actually impacting the games industry.
5654000	5661000	So these worlds are colliding so you kind of you kind of have to pay attention to what's going on around you.
5661000	5671000	So I'm sure a lot of you guys have heard about the executive order that banned immigration and visas from seven different countries.
5671000	5672000	Overruled.
5672000	5682000	Which yes has been overruled by a judge. I believe the Department of Justice filed an urgent appeal or whatever they call it.
5682000	5688000	Which was denied. That doesn't mean to be fair that doesn't mean the ban is permanently overruled.
5688000	5693000	The appeal can still go through. It just will not be fast. It will not be urgent immediately.
5693000	5695000	The appeal actually got rejected.
5695000	5699000	Oh was it? I thought the fast appeal was rejected. Not the full appeal.
5699000	5704000	That could possibly be it but I saw I read it just the other day while I was high on meds.
5704000	5709000	Regardless, it's not over. Even if it stays.
5709000	5711000	Our so-called president.
5711000	5718000	So look anyway here's the deal and I'm not just talking about the fact that you know and I think a lot of you were seeing this on blogs going around this week.
5718000	5730000	That Nasir Gebelli who was an Iranian immigrant if I recall correctly was actually the programmer on the original Final Fantasy game.
5730000	5741000	So he worked for Square at the time and created basically the original NES. I mean it was made in Japan but he did like the coding for it for the NES version of it.
5741000	5744000	He also did games like 3D World Runner, Rad Racer, Secret of Mana, etc.
5744000	5755000	So despite however you feel about this issue which I just want to make it very clear. It's crap. I feel personally it is total fucking crap.
5755000	5762000	Because America was founded on people coming from other places and we call ourselves the melting pot.
5762000	5765000	Anyway try to get off my soapbox.
5765000	5766000	Only if you're white.
5766000	5771000	I'm going to try to get off my soapbox. Well you know what white people weren't here to begin with.
5771000	5773000	I just had that chat with my mother today.
5773000	5778000	I know I know. Anyway get off my soapbox and try to stick to the facts here.
5778000	5786000	And that is the fact that you know the ESA the Entertainment Software Association has come out and said some things against the ban.
5786000	5796000	So the ESA said the Entertainment Software Association urges the White House to exercise caution with regard to vital immigration and foreign worker programs.
5796000	5804000	As a leading force in technology and exporter of entertainment the U.S. video game industry thrives on the contribution of innovators and storytellers from around the world.
5804000	5809000	While recognizing that enhancing national security and protecting our country's citizens are critical goals.
5809000	5813000	Our companies rely on the skilled talent of U.S. citizens, foreign nationals and immigrants alike.
5813000	5818000	Our nation's actions and words to support their participation in the American economy.
5818000	5823000	And look a lot of people tech companies as well coming out with very similar language against the ban.
5823000	5829000	Washington was the state where this was successfully overturned.
5829000	5837000	And that is because of companies like Microsoft, big technology company, Amazon and other Washington based companies.
5837000	5839000	Expedia I think was the other one.
5839000	5841000	And we've had more local ones speaking out too.
5841000	5847000	Well sure lots of companies speaking out but I'm just talking specifically Washington for a minute because that's the reason why this got overturned in the moment.
5847000	5851000	And Microsoft obviously a big part of the gaming thing as well.
5851000	5857000	But they spoke out and said this ban immediately directly affects what we're doing.
5857000	5863000	Because Nasir came over here and you know Final Fantasy is what it is because of him.
5863000	5867000	That is continuing in all these gaming companies right.
5867000	5876000	Guess what if you enjoy a video game there's a very very very fucking good chance that somebody from one of these seven countries had their hand in it somewhere.
5876000	5878000	So it's affecting all these countries.
5878000	5883000	And that's why you have all these companies that are coming out and saying this sucks.
5883000	5891000	Because you know we had somebody coming over here that was going to you know be investigating the cure for whooping cough was it.
5891000	5897000	And you know can't get here because of your arbitrary brush against these countries.
5897000	5902000	Basically their racism and Islamophobia is getting in the way of what the country was founded on.
5902000	5907000	Coming together as a diverse people to make a better life.
5907000	5910000	And we were already vetting people for the record.
5910000	5915000	If you want to talk about the bad people that caused the Bowling Green massacre never forget.
5915000	5917000	Never remember.
5917000	5919000	They vet people already.
5919000	5923000	We need to wait to talk about the whole Bowling Green thing until it actually happens.
5923000	5925000	You know what I'm saying.
5925000	5929000	I wouldn't wish that on the community of Bowling Green, Ohio or Kentucky.
5929000	5931000	So I did a little search.
5931000	5935000	You were right it's on the quick overturn.
5935000	5941000	They are telling them they have to file paperwork and there's already a motion started for impeachment.
5941000	5943000	Oh that I didn't know.
5943000	5950000	I honestly thought the impeachment thing was going to be like a daily thing that somebody in the house would put on the floor.
5950000	5952000	Just like overturning the Affordable Care Act.
5952000	5956000	It actually was started by Maxine wasn't it?
5956000	5960000	By a Dallas lawmaker.
5960000	5965000	But then who's going to take over when President Bannon gets taken out of office?
5965000	5968000	That's okay Trump will still bend over for him.
5968000	5974000	They will find somebody else to be the Muppet in Chief that Bannon can put his hand up their ass I'm sure.
5974000	5981000	Anyway moving on I want to talk about Devolver Digital because this is a very good thing that Devolver is doing.
5981000	5985000	Well they shouldn't have to fucking do it but they're doing it so good on them snaps for you.
5985000	5992000	So Devolver Digital put out an open call to developers basically saying hey if you're unable to come to GDC this year.
5992000	6001000	If you're getting shut out of GDC because of this ban just like Oscar nominated filmmakers are not able to attend the ceremonies because of the ban.
6001000	6012000	Devolver Digital is saying in a press release that we will demo the game for you at what's called Devolver Underground which is going to be near the convention center.
6012000	6024000	I think Devolver was probably already always planning to show their own games this way but they're basically saying they have gaming PCs, they have Vive VR headsets available, space is limited.
6024000	6032000	They're going to prioritize developers who had already made travel plans to GDC but have had to cancel in light of what's going on.
6032000	6038000	GDC the official organization has said they will refund people if you have been affected by this.
6038000	6043000	Which hopefully thanks to what happened in Washington and hopefully things stay that way.
6043000	6050000	Hopefully these folks can come over here anyway but at the same time I couldn't fault them if they didn't want to at this point.
6050000	6062000	So anyway Devolver Digital is going to be doing this so cool at least these games will get to be seen at GDC if they want at this point.
6063000	6072000	Alright that's it. That's my political story for now so let's move on. Let's talk about something else that sucks StarSakura.
6072000	6075000	I know you're ready to talk about something else that sucks.
6075000	6079000	I don't know exactly how accurate this is.
6079000	6081000	It's Bad News Sunday.
6081000	6086000	Look what happens when the Patriots win the fucking Super Bowl.
6086000	6088000	Well it did happen with the election too.
6088000	6093000	Bad News Sunday. That's right. Bad News 2017. Anyway but at least Betty White's still alive.
6093000	6098000	One of my friends just said that the Super Bowl was a parable for the election.
6098000	6101000	Can we not?
6101000	6103000	Let's not. It's all dumb.
6103000	6114000	Anyway apparently GameStop has been I'm going to say discouraging their employees from selling unopened copies of games.
6114000	6117000	They have a program called the Circle of Life.
6117000	6122000	The Circle of Life. It's a movie about lions.
6122000	6127000	Maybe you need to borrow my Blu-ray. Lion King 3D.
6127000	6130000	That was a clap back to part A.
6130000	6133000	You know I freaking have that on laserdisc I think.
6134000	6144000	Anyway so basically they get percentage quotas for pre-orders, reward card subscriptions, and used game sales and then game trade-ins.
6144000	6148000	Each of these quotas are based on their total transactions.
6148000	6154000	So pre-orders and reward cards are the big ones of course.
6154000	6171000	Used game sales and trade are some sort of calculation that they have for what's going to make the money.
6171000	6177000	Scam. It's a scam. That's the word you're looking for. Scam.
6177000	6182000	So basically if someone goes in to pick up a game without pre-ordering a game,
6182000	6187000	subscribing for a rewards card, buying a used game, or trading in some games to help pay for it,
6187000	6191000	the transaction will knock down those four percentages.
6191000	6196000	Because it's based on total number of sales and what percentage of them make up a certain thing.
6196000	6211000	So now apparently this is coming from a GameStop staff member who says that they're telling people that they don't have a game in stock so they can sell a used one.
6212000	6218000	So that it doesn't hit their numbers. This is apparently going company-wide.
6218000	6231000	So they'll say that, for example, game A is out new. They don't have it so they'll sell it pre-owned.
6231000	6237000	Or just say fucking used. So they'll sell the used one.
6238000	6246000	And that it also, each employee gets a perk for selling within those parameters.
6246000	6254000	So just be cognizant of it when you go in.
6254000	6259000	Like if someone goes in and you don't have a reservation for a game, you can just tell them,
6259000	6263000	if this is your circle of life thing, go get me the game.
6264000	6269000	I would just say, well, A, I haven't shopped at GameStop in years anyway.
6269000	6272000	I have been in them, so I know they've changed.
6272000	6279000	I will say, okay, fine, I did buy one thing at a GameStop and it was in Atlanta when I was at DragonCon.
6279000	6282000	I bought a lanyard at GameStop because I forgot to.
6282000	6288000	Every year I'm notorious for forgetting a fucking lanyard for DragonCon because it's the one convention that doesn't give you one.
6289000	6295000	So I went with our pal Misty, who listens to this show, on a train to go to the mall.
6295000	6300000	We went to GameStop and I got a lanyard. It's a sweet lanyard. I will say that. It's a Pokemon lanyard.
6300000	6304000	But it's the one thing I've got at GameStop in like the past three years.
6304000	6310000	Because I just go to other, you know, and so if somebody were to pull that line on me, I would just be like,
6310000	6313000	alright, well, I'll go to Amazon. Thanks. Leave.
6313000	6317000	I wouldn't take it out on the employees and that's one thing we all need to remember in this.
6317000	6323000	Is that these people that work at GameStop probably hate this fucking thing as much as the rest of us do.
6323000	6325000	And they're just trying to make a living.
6325000	6326000	It's, yeah, I mean...
6326000	6328000	It affects their paycheck too.
6328000	6329000	Yeah.
6329000	6332000	Their whole thing, I mean, I understand why they're doing it.
6332000	6339000	It's, you know, to keep it profitable because there's more of a profit margin for used games than new games.
6339000	6345000	There's no profit margin on hardware and that's why they have to do this in order to stay profitable to keep the business going.
6346000	6347000	It still sucks though.
6349000	6357000	But, and it sucks that, you know, the employees feel that they have to do this in order to keep up these standards because there is such high turnover.
6357000	6362000	It reminds me of like a lot of like the call center environments and stuff like that where there's the, you know,
6362000	6366000	oh yeah, they hit a certain quota or else, you know, you better be working more hours.
6366000	6367000	You better rush those people off the phone.
6367000	6368000	Yeah.
6368000	6370000	Which is like the worst thing you can possibly do.
6370000	6376000	But anyway, Akuma JP in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, we don't have condoms right now.
6376000	6378000	You can buy this used condom though.
6378000	6379000	Ew.
6381000	6382000	Now, now.
6383000	6385000	It's a previously owned condom.
6387000	6392000	Dungeon Buster says, this article helped me find a cheaper deal on Watch Dogs 2.
6392000	6396000	A GameStop employee mentioned that Watch Dogs was 29 at GameStop.
6396000	6398000	It isn't, at least according to their site.
6398000	6403000	While the used version is 54, but Best Buy actually had it for 29 at the time.
6403000	6405000	I did some digging.
6405000	6407000	The policy is also not new at GameStop.
6407000	6413000	When it was Babbage's, there was also a drive to push ads on purchases like magazines, et cetera, to help numbers.
6413000	6417000	Well, in retail, they're always going to upsell you things anyway.
6417000	6423000	Which I think in general, by the way, just to get a little tangenty for a minute.
6423000	6427000	These sorts of policies are what's turning people to online.
6427000	6430000	And why people don't like shop in stores anymore.
6430000	6436000	Because I don't want to use the broad stroke, millennials, but I'm going to in this case.
6436000	6439000	And I even kind of loop myself in, even though technically based on my year, I'm Gen X.
6439000	6443000	But I mean, what are these labels anyway, but whatever.
6443000	6452000	But millennials don't like that pressure of going into a store and knowing that they're going to get upsold all this shit.
6452000	6454000	Who does? No one does.
6454000	6456000	Yeah, that's right. I was going to say, kind of no one does.
6456000	6458000	It's like not the millennials, it's anybody.
6458000	6461000	Remember when they used to fucking do magazine subscriptions with Best Buy and stuff?
6461000	6465000	Like you purchase something with a credit card and get signed up for like a magazine.
6465000	6474000	The reason why I use that broad stroke, just to be clear, is because I think now that that technology is there that makes it easy to go somewhere else where you don't have to deal with people.
6474000	6482000	I mean, fucking A. Even Starbucks now, which usually has pretty much the friendliest employees I see, right?
6482000	6487000	I don't usually get angry baristas, but maybe once in a huge while.
6487000	6489000	Like usually the people at Starbucks are very pleasant to interact with.
6489000	6497000	But even at Starbucks, I can punch in my order on the phone, hit the thing, walk over to Starbucks, the drinks already on the counter.
6497000	6500000	I pick it up and I walk out the door like I fucking stole it.
6501000	6505000	And listen, round table, I don't want your fucking wings, okay?
6505000	6509000	You've been offering me your brand new wings for like several years now.
6509000	6513000	I'm ordering a fucking pizza, I don't want your goddamn wings.
6513000	6518000	Now Bob Coffee points out upselling happens online also, service plan, lolz.
6518000	6526000	You know, that's true, but I think it's easier to tell a monitor no than it might be for some people to look someone in the eye and tell them no.
6527000	6532000	Plus you don't have the pressure of like that person basically knows that that's their commission.
6532000	6537000	Look at a site like when you go and register a web domain, right?
6537000	6543000	You can do a cheap web domain for like really low cost, but then it's like, well, add this and add this.
6543000	6549000	And don't you want the dot org and the dot net and the dot xxx and all this other stuff too?
6549000	6551000	I do want the dot xxx.
6551000	6557000	You know, like, oh my god, like that is someone like the worst online with the upselling that I've ever seen, right?
6557000	6561000	But it's still pretty easy to get around, you know, so it's just different.
6561000	6568000	But my whole point to this whole thing was, I think that is why you have a lot of retail that's fucking hurting.
6568000	6573000	Like fucking Macy's is about to go under, it seems like, or it's going to get bought or something like that.
6573000	6578000	And it's like, Macy's is like the department store at every fucking mall.
6578000	6589000	And they're about to, they're looking at tough times right now because people will buy clothes online because they don't even need to try them on in a real store anymore.
6589000	6593000	If it doesn't fit, they just put it in the box and send it back and the clothes people are still making money.
6593000	6596000	So it's just, it just, yeah.
6596000	6605000	Anyway, these policies, so the fact that this came out for GameStop and is out there and circulating the internet is really bad news to them.
6605000	6613000	So I don't, and I don't know if you've seen anything on this Dark Soccer or Logie, anybody, has GameStop tried to put a cork on this in the past few days that this has happened?
6613000	6615000	I haven't seen anything.
6615000	6619000	I haven't seen anything either. So if they have tried to put a cork on it, it hasn't been effective.
6619000	6622000	Maybe it's on their Twitter or some shit, I don't know.
6622000	6627000	Or it's true and they're having to deal with a fallout, you know?
6627000	6630000	And some folks in chat are saying, yeah, I have friends at GameStop and this is true.
6630000	6639000	I don't doubt that this is true, but these sorts of policies are killing retail and killing those types of jobs like those folks that are working at GameStop.
6639000	6644000	So you need to fucking shape up your policies, GameStop.
6644000	6650000	Especially considering you have a younger audience, you know, usually, who knows how to fucking use online?
6650000	6654000	Start selling those Wii U games a little cheaper because, my God, fucking Nintendo.
6654000	6663000	I wanted to get it. I'm still looking at maybe getting a used copy of Pokken Tournament so my son can play it because he wants a new game.
6663000	6671000	And they're just not marking that shit down and that's Nintendo's fault because they're not marking that shit down. Not price protecting that shit.
6671000	6678000	Sorry, William Murderface following up on my Starbucks comment saying, those ordering apps are great if you have weird orders or customized orders.
6678000	6685000	I imagine that they make it a bit easier for the staff as well. Oh my God, you just hit the nail on the head on why I actually love to use that Starbucks app.
6685000	6692000	Because we all know that asshole at the counter, who happens to be me, who's always like, okay, can I get a latte?
6692000	6700000	But I want to get two pumps of the sugar-free this and two pumps of the sugar-free that and I want to get with the nonfat milk.
6701000	6709000	So I always feel like I'm such an asshole, but with the phone, I can just put it all in and it's fine.
6709000	6715000	And to be fair, I don't do that all the time. But I feel like I can do that with the phone app a lot easier.
6715000	6721000	Otherwise, I'll walk up to the counter and just be like, alright, Skinny Cinnamon Dolce Latte is good enough.
6721000	6727000	And just order that. But if I want the drink I really want, I'll use the app.
6728000	6735000	Let's see, Fifth Dream is pointing out plane tickets. Want to rent a car? Get a hotel? Insurance? Yeah, certainly.
6735000	6739000	But you know what? Back in the day of travel agents, I'm sure it was just as bad.
6739000	6743000	Travel agents are still around though for some things, right? But that used to be a huge industry.
6743000	6754000	You wanted to book a trip to Hawaii, you went to a travel agency who booked it for you because your computer couldn't get onto Delta's site to book whatever flight you wanted.
6754000	6762000	So, anyway. I'll be interested to see if GameStop tries to do any damage control on this, but I've already seen a lot of-
6762000	6763000	I don't think that they will at this point.
6763000	6766000	A lot of people on social media are kind of like, well fuck if I ever shop-
6766000	6771000	You can't say no, that's not true. I just won't say anything. People will forget.
6771000	6780000	A lot of people I've seen at GameStop, or excuse me, on social media are like, well fuck if I ever shop at GameStop again and I can't help but think, you just now are going to start to be-
6780000	6788000	I still purchase the power-up card because occasionally I will buy something to use and it does end up saving me money.
6788000	6790000	It's only 15 bucks a year, I don't really care about that.
6790000	6798000	And I used to like the magazine, but now even their magazine that comes in the mail, I kind of like skim through it like five seconds and then throw it away.
6799000	6808000	I mean, it's just, it's like oh goody, reviews for games I've already read the reviews for several weeks ago. It's not interesting anymore.
6808000	6812000	So, I don't know. Even the value of that's kind of going away.
6812000	6817000	Alright, we're going to get to the Skype line here real soon. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
6817000	6823000	But first, we need to pep up the mood here a little bit on Bad News Sunday.
6823000	6826000	You know what we're going to need to do, Loki? We need to do some nudity.
6826000	6832000	That's just going to have to happen. We need some nudity to pep us up and end on a happy note.
6832000	6835000	Yes. So, for Valentine's Day-
6835000	6836000	Not from us!
6836000	6837000	Thank God!
6837000	6839000	In gaming. Nudity in gaming.
6839000	6845000	So, for Valentine's Day, you can celebrate with Dead or Alive Xtreme 3.
6846000	6856000	They're going to have some brand new Valentine's Day garb, which really just consists of ribbons strategically placed on a woman's body.
6856000	6859000	And you can purchase that coming soon.
6859000	6864000	Yeah. Oh, and it'll be free. So, that's pretty awesome.
6864000	6873000	And then, of course, to go along with that, there is an exploit to see the women without their bathing suits on.
6873000	6883000	Yes. If you have a Playstation VR, and you happen to be doing the photo mode that they have in there, and you dip your head under the water, the suits won't render.
6883000	6887000	But thankfully, they didn't spend the time to draw genitalia in, so you can-
6887000	6888000	It's just the bottom part.
6888000	6890000	You can just see, you know-
6890000	6892000	So, it's Barbie doll bottom.
6892000	6893000	You can see butt crack.
6893000	6895000	Yeah, you can see Barbie stuff.
6896000	6903000	So, they didn't render it because they didn't want something happening like what happened to the Elder Scrolls.
6903000	6910000	They knew. Okay, listen. They know better. They're like, okay, listen. We put genitals on there. People are going to take that shit off.
6910000	6919000	Alright. Well, now, here's the thing. Now, usually Dark Sakura, wouldn't you follow up a story like this by saying, now, where are the Dongs?
6919000	6923000	Where's my Dead or Alive Xtreme that has the Dongs?
6923000	6924000	I don't care.
6924000	6925000	Alright, well-
6925000	6928000	Because there's no guys in the game except for Teletubby.
6928000	6931000	Pretend to care for me for a minute because-
6931000	6933000	Okay, I'll care for five seconds.
6933000	6936000	There's a brand new game out there called Conan Exiles.
6936000	6937000	What?
6937000	6939000	And you've probably never heard of Conan Exiles.
6939000	6940000	No.
6940000	6941000	Is it like Conan the Barbarian?
6941000	6951000	Yes, it is. It's that same type of thing. And here's the thing. A lot of people hadn't heard of Conan Exiles until word got out via early access marketing and so forth.
6951000	6965000	For some reason, the PR team failed to mention that when you customize your character in Conan Exile, you get to customize the genitals. That's right.
6965000	6967000	And they're crucified.
6967000	6976000	Yes, in the opening of the game or whatever. There is actually a slider bar for endowment. So you can play-
6976000	6979000	This is the funniest thing I've ever seen.
6980000	6989000	Dark Sakura looks like she just woke up, I was going to say on Christmas, but on Hanukkah to find an endowment slider under the menorah.
6989000	6992000	I truly do not care about dick that much.
6992000	6993000	I know, I know.
6993000	6999000	But it's just funny because it's like, little, big, little, big, porn, little.
6999000	7005000	Now it's like, oh, now everybody else can, you know, experience what's happened with the booby slider for years.
7005000	7006000	Pornstar.
7006000	7013000	Now to be fair, also, Conan does let you play as a female character and you are able to-
7013000	7014000	Give her a huge clit?
7014000	7019000	Besides the- I hadn't investigated that, Dark Sakura. I don't know if you can-
7019000	7021000	You've heard Large Penis as well?
7021000	7022000	I have no idea.
7022000	7024000	Can we make an intersex character? That would be cool.
7024000	7028000	You know what? Fucking email Funcom because I didn't ask these questions.
7028000	7038000	But you do have a breast slider on the women that you can have big boobies or little boobies or whatever you desire.
7038000	7040000	Here's the interesting thing about it.
7040000	7042000	That's why the guy does balls bounce.
7043000	7047000	You know, there's GIFs on this thing and it's hilarious.
7047000	7053000	So look, Dark Sakura hadn't heard about this fucking game, probably wouldn't have given two shits about it.
7053000	7054000	I'm going to play this shit now.
7054000	7058000	See? This is what- look at what's fucking happening.
7058000	7062000	All of a sudden, there's penis in a video game and everybody's like,
7062000	7064000	What? Penis?
7064000	7066000	And it's like- I shit you not.
7066000	7069000	It's the like fourth most popular game on Twitch right now.
7069000	7072000	Everybody's streaming penis.
7072000	7074000	It's so funny because the-
7074000	7076000	Are you not supposed to be doing that? Don't they have rules against it?
7076000	7077000	Or hilarious.
7077000	7078000	I think Twitch-
7078000	7079000	But it's not real penis.
7079000	7081000	Twitch does have some rule against it.
7081000	7088000	Like it can't be the focus, but like if it happens to be in the game, they kind of can't- like-
7088000	7091000	Oh my god, he even gave him the butthole.
7093000	7101000	Loki, if that were the hard fast rule on Twitch, I wouldn't be able to stream God of War because there's naked ladies in that.
7101000	7109000	So they have to kind of be like, well, as long as it's not the focus of the game, but it's certainly the focus of half the streamers out there right now.
7109000	7111000	I have to put this in the chat room.
7111000	7116000	I'm sure a lot of chatters are probably signing onto Twitch right now to check it out if they haven't already seen it.
7116000	7117000	These are the gifts.
7117000	7121000	And as a reminder, we're focused on the boys right now, but it does have women in it as well.
7121000	7122000	Caution, dong.
7122000	7129000	If you want to run around with your, you know, tatas and the whole South America hanging out, that's fine.
7129000	7135000	Rust kind of did that, but except being able to adjust the size of that, you know, they just did it randomly.
7135000	7137000	And also I think they randomly signed your gender as well.
7137000	7145000	And then, of course, let's not forget that Saints Row has this available as well, except they don't actually have, you know, genitals being rendered.
7145000	7147000	It's just kind of a bulge that you have in there.
7149000	7153000	I agree with, with, come on, Noel.
7153000	7154000	Whatever.
7154000	7156000	Come on, Noel Gus.
7156000	7158000	I desire a happy trail slider.
7160000	7161000	I wonder if you can control their hair.
7161000	7163000	I don't know if you can do body hair.
7163000	7166000	You could go on full on bear if you wanted, I don't know.
7166000	7167000	I haven't studied.
7167000	7173000	Now here's the amazing thing. You have all these stories floating around out there about Conan Exile's dog slider.
7173000	7175000	Still couldn't tell you how the game plays.
7176000	7178000	What kind of game is it? I don't know.
7178000	7181000	The game where you jump up and down and watch a penis bounce.
7184000	7192000	I, I think it's one of those like third person collect things and craft things in the new world.
7192000	7194000	Why don't we just do like, I mean, come on.
7194000	7197000	I mean, Dead or Alive is kind of going that way anyways with Dead or Alive Xtreme.
7197000	7199000	Let's just do another Dead or Alive Xtreme 4.
7199000	7201000	Just full nudity, full rendered everything.
7201000	7203000	Have guys and women there.
7203000	7204000	Done.
7204000	7205000	They're porn games.
7205000	7206000	We're, we're good.
7206000	7208000	Fifth Dream in chat says, I hear it's a survival game.
7208000	7209000	So great.
7209000	7212000	This is what happens when you put buttholes in Minecraft.
7214000	7219000	I, I had to put those two gifs in chat because they're just so funny.
7219000	7225000	And then people are going to be trying to like swing their penis using the physics of the game into someone else's butthole and shit like that.
7226000	7227000	Is it multiplayer?
7227000	7230000	It is. Obviously, if it's a survival game, it's got to be multiplayer.
7230000	7231000	I guess, I guess it's got to be, right?
7231000	7232000	I don't know. It's in early access right now.
7232000	7236000	At least it wasn't like that one game that had the dicks with the butts on them.
7237000	7239000	Cock jousting or whatever it was.
7239000	7240000	Yeah, it was like a penis jousting.
7240000	7241000	General jousting.
7241000	7242000	General jousting. Yeah, that was the whole thing.
7242000	7244000	Did you ever see that one Dark Soccer?
7244000	7245000	Yes, I did.
7245000	7247000	I swear you were here when it came up on the show, yeah.
7247000	7248000	Yes.
7248000	7250000	Anyway, there you go.
7252000	7259000	Tigerclaw says, on Steam, an open world survival game set in the brutal lands of Conan the Barbarian.
7259000	7265000	Survive in a hostile world, build your kingdom, and dominate your enemies in both single and multiplayer.
7266000	7267000	There it is.
7267000	7268000	Coming soon.
7269000	7270000	Multidongs.
7271000	7279000	You can give us a call if you want to talk about DONGs, or Vijay, or maybe something else going on in gaming this week would be great too.
7279000	7284000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, or if you want to do it the old fashioned way, you can do it there too.
7284000	7286000	1-877-GAME-OLR.
7286000	7289000	Real quick though before I go to the phone, any last minute stories you want to throw in here?
7289000	7291000	Yeah, I was going to mention, there's one I missed.
7291000	7296000	Nintendo is sold at 1.5 million NES Classic Editions, and they are still apologizing for shortages.
7296000	7299000	Yeah, because I still can't get one. What the hell, man?
7299000	7300000	That's lame.
7300000	7306000	And then also, some weird person is lining up already at the Nintendo World Store in New York for the Nintendo Switch.
7306000	7315000	Can we, like, I understand that people are fanboys about this shit, but can we, like, please draw the line somewhere where lining up a month before it comes out is a little fucking stupid?
7315000	7318000	I mean, come on. I get it. You want to be first in line.
7318000	7320000	But that's fucking dumb.
7321000	7324000	That's like, oh, I'm going to go line up for Half-Life right now.
7324000	7327000	At what point do you become a line wayer to, like, homeless?
7327000	7332000	How is that person getting money? I mean, if they saved the monies, they could take a month off to do it. Good on them.
7332000	7341000	How are they staying in line for that long? Because if they're the only one in line, because there's not people who are going to be crazy enough to do that, then who's watching their spot when they have to go to the bathroom or eat or something?
7341000	7343000	Or just pissing on the street, I guess.
7343000	7345000	Are there two of them in line right now?
7345000	7347000	I think it's him and Triforce.
7347000	7349000	So they probably are looking out for each other.
7349000	7351000	Probably one of those.
7351000	7352000	Still stupid.
7352000	7358000	And Stoppy says he's a pro YouTuber. That's where the money's coming from. Watching him on YouTube.
7358000	7360000	Oh, good.
7360000	7362000	How about that?
7362000	7375000	Well, I did find something neat today, and I don't want to give Walmart any business, but I had to get it there because it's the only place that has them. Our little LCD monitor arcade games.
7375000	7377000	I kind of want one now that you showed me.
7377000	7378000	They're 20 bucks.
7378000	7380000	I'm kind of fucking pissed off you showed me those.
7380000	7384000	I almost asked you if you wanted me to grab you one.
7384000	7392000	Kind of, yeah, but they're full games. With the screen, they're like yay big, which is great. Maybe a foot tall?
7392000	7400000	LCD screens are fucking cheap now. You can get one of those Atari Flashback consoles, but it's actually a portable gaming thing that looks like a Lynx or something, I don't know.
7400000	7401000	Something like that.
7401000	7406000	But even smaller. Maybe like a Game Boy Mini. You can get one of those that's an Atari Flashback for like 50 bucks.
7406000	7409000	Like, LCD screens, I guess technology's getting really cheap.
7409000	7422000	It's supposed to be like a four-part thing, and we got the ones that we were really interested in. We wanted the Qbert, so we got Qbert, although I think it's one of the home-immulated versions or something like that.
7422000	7429000	And Centipede, although I agree with Dan, it's kind of lame. It doesn't have a trackball on it instead. If it had a trackball, it would have been perfect.
7429000	7436000	But I mean, it's got the cabinet art and everything. They're just really cool little things.
7436000	7438000	I kind of want one.
7438000	7440000	Well, I'll tell you-
7440000	7442000	Alan's gonna be mad when I bring more shit in this house.
7442000	7447000	I'll tell you the one fucking Walmart in town I found a mat, and they only had one of each left when I left.
7447000	7450000	And that was the one up South What?
7450000	7452000	Oh, the what? The Middle of Nowhere one?
7452000	7453000	The new one, yeah.
7453000	7457000	The one that's like in- I don't know why they built a Walmart there, because there's nothing out there.
7457000	7459000	There's like some neighborhoods over there.
7459000	7461000	Crazy. I wonder, you could probably still go into Walmart.com-
7461000	7463000	No, you can't order them online.
7463000	7465000	You can't do the whole pick up and store? That whole thing?
7465000	7466000	They don't let you order them online.
7466000	7467000	What?
7467000	7468000	That's ridiculous.
7468000	7471000	I'm heading back up that way if you want me to grab you a couple.
7471000	7473000	Yeah, maybe, maybe. I might have to think about that.
7473000	7478000	Alright, let's get to the calls, though, over at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
7478000	7479000	We do have a call coming in. Let's get to it.
7479000	7481000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
7481000	7483000	It's Rayginator.
7483000	7485000	Hey, Rayginator. How you doing?
7485000	7490000	Pretty good. Just having a little fun trolling on Twitter right now.
7490000	7493000	What are you trolling on Twitter, Rayginator?
7493000	7495000	The so-called president.
7496000	7501000	Or as I like to call him, the Oompa Loompa and crazy.
7501000	7505000	Is this what's happening in 2017? It's like BRB, I gotta go cyberbully the president.
7505000	7512000	Okay, wait. There's a whole actual movement behind it because he's such a narcissist and so self-centered
7512000	7517000	that the whole point is to completely destabilize him until he's forced to resign
7517000	7524000	or has an episode that makes him, oh crap, what was it? It was for invoking the 25th Amendment.
7524000	7531000	Fascinating. This year's harvest will be quite bountiful. Anyway, what's on your mind, Rayginator?
7532000	7541000	Well, I was thinking, sorry to get a little tongue-tied.
7541000	7553000	One thing I've been wondering is has there been any games that you bought over God knows how long
7553000	7562000	before you bought it, you think, oh yeah, this game is going to be great.
7562000	7568000	You go out, buy it, and then as soon as you get it home and play it, you think, oh my God, what the hell,
7568000	7571000	dad, waste my money on this. This is a total piece of shit.
7571000	7576000	Yes. There's a game, and the first thing that jumps to mind, and I was so mad about this,
7576000	7580000	there was a game on the Xbox 360 called Fusion Frenzy 2.
7580000	7585000	And the original Fusion Frenzy was an okay game, which was kind of like a rip-off of Mario Party of sorts,
7585000	7591000	but you know, hey, I'm all for Mario Party clones. That one on the 360 was such hot fucking garbage,
7591000	7598000	I was actually angry that I bought it. I was like, why did I give this company my money? I was mad.
7598000	7603000	So that would be me. What about you guys? Have you ever made a purchase, you get home, you play it,
7603000	7609000	and you're like, I am mad. I rented a game once. It's not the same thing. But it was so bad.
7609000	7613000	You wanted your $3 rental back. No, get this. We took it back to Blockbuster.
7613000	7619000	And we said, this game is bad. It was like WCW, Thunder, WWF, Thunder, some wrestling game.
7619000	7624000	Dan and I were really into wrestling games. And we took it back. Were? Well, were, yeah.
7624000	7630000	I'm not so much into them. But we took the game back and said, this was really, really bad.
7630000	7637000	Can we get something different? And so they're like, okay. And that works?
7637000	7642000	Wow. Okay. All right. Cool.
7642000	7647000	Yeah. Unfortunately, Jamie just triggered a really bad memory of mine.
7647000	7655000	Unfortunately, I was stupid enough to get that Thunder game used from Blockbuster.
7655000	7666000	Regretted it to this day. And I also picked up more combat on the Super Nintendo.
7666000	7673000	That wasn't as bad as Thunder, but still pretty damn bad, though.
7673000	7679000	I mean, it was basically bleached or sanitized.
7679000	7686000	They took all the fun out of Mortal Kombat when they released it on the Super Nintendo.
7686000	7691000	So, Super Nintendo Mortal Kombat with the sweat, you just weren't having it.
7691000	7705000	Exactly. At least in the arcade, what differentiated Mortal Kombat from, say, well, the biggest competitor at the time was Street Fighter.
7705000	7714000	Mortal Kombat was supposed to be over top, really gory, with all the fatalities and the blood and all that.
7714000	7720000	Decapitation is why people played Mortal Kombat. Having grown up in that era,
7720000	7725000	and I remember distinctly going to a place like Nickel Mania, the all-nickel arcade,
7725000	7729000	and playing things like Street Fighter II and Mortal Kombat, that was the reason why people played Mortal Kombat.
7729000	7734000	They wanted to do the fatalities. And it was cool or funny or whatever.
7734000	7739000	They got more cartoony in part two, so it started to kind of get borderline camp.
7739000	7744000	So it's like Street Fighter was kind of like your serious fighting game, and then Mortal Kombat was kind of your camp.
7744000	7749000	And I realize that there's some hardcore Mortal Kombat fans that probably wouldn't appreciate me calling me that,
7749000	7752000	but honestly, it was part of the reason of its success in the beginning.
7752000	7757000	And I think it was supposed to be camp. Look at a character like Johnny Cage and tell me that's not fucking camp.
7758000	7761000	I wouldn't necessarily say it was campy.
7761000	7774000	Now, I think my more... Now, this is just my interpretation, but I think Mortal Kombat set out to be, for lack of a better term, edgy.
7774000	7786000	I kind of equate it to those 70s-style pulp action movies, the gory ones, stuff like that.
7786000	7797000	They kind of went for the edgy, the shocking value, because as far as I know, unless I'm wrong here,
7798000	7814000	Mortal Kombat was one of the first games that had the over-the-top gore and blood and all that.
7814000	7822000	Well, it had the graphics to be able to really do something like that, because technically, okay, maybe it wasn't like over-the-top gore,
7822000	7830000	but there were Atari 2600 games that were very controversial because of the crazy over-the-top stuff that they were showing.
7830000	7832000	Custer's Revenge?
7832000	7835000	Yeah, of course, things like that. Beat Em and Eat Em and things like that.
7835000	7845000	So, of course, I still say to this day, video games are art, and wherever there is art, people are going to push art to offensive territories,
7845000	7853000	such as what you saw in those Atari 2600 games, because especially a game like Custer's Revenge is kind of pretty fucking offensive if you think about it.
7853000	7865000	And I think Mortal Kombat, in a way, was art that was intended to shock and offend, with the whole decapitations and the over-the-top fatalities.
7865000	7870000	Like a good old John Waters movie where Divine eats poop at the end of it.
7870000	7879000	That was set up to shock and offend and get people to talk about it and have other people pay money to go see the movie, because they couldn't believe that it actually happened.
7879000	7891000	So, I mean, Mortal Kombat just had the luxury, or whatever you want to call it, of they had the photorealism was coming out around that time.
7891000	7904000	The whole capturing the sprite from photos, that was kind of a thing that was catching on more and more, and so they were able to make a photorealistic type of camp game like that, and that's where Mortal Kombat was really one of the first.
7904000	7920000	But there were certainly other camp around the same time. Night Trap would be another great example of controversial camp that was definitely put out there to just be shocking and sell that way.
7920000	7929000	Let me ask this though, Loki. I didn't want to skip you. Was there ever a game that you bought or anything that was so fucking bad you were mad about it?
7929000	7942000	I can't think of anything. I'm usually pretty careful about what I bought. I can't think of anything that I was really angry about.
7942000	7952000	DungeonBuster in chat says, to me, at the time, Mortal Kombat seemed like an extreme version of Pit Fighter. It seemed like a playable version of Pit Fighter. Pit Fighter was a real garbage game, in my opinion.
7952000	7964000	I mean, Pit Fighter was just one of those things where it was, oh cool, it's photorealistic things, but that's about where it ends, because Pit Fighter is kind of a garbage game, in my opinion. Especially the Super Nintendo version. Jesus.
7964000	7987000	The thing is, going way back in the day, when my parents were in bowling leagues and they dragged my siblings and I along, just rolling around the place while they bowled, the bowling alley did have a Pit Fighter game there for a while.
7987000	8006000	And while it wasn't necessarily my favorite game, it was kind of sort of playable, but it was at least interesting for its time, but like you said, the Super Nintendo version was horrible though.
8006000	8020000	If you had to play Pit Fighter, if only for its place in gaming history, just go with the arcade version. Skip the Super Nintendo.
8020000	8026000	Alright, well, Ray Jainer, I'm going to let you go to try to get some more calls, but thank you for the question.
8026000	8028000	Yep, sure, have a good one.
8028000	8029000	See ya, bye bye.
8030000	8034000	Alright, OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype if you want to try and get through here before we wrap things up.
8034000	8041000	Let's see, DungeonBuster in chat says, Pit Fighter was so clunky. Yeah, that was a big problem with it. It was so clunky, it was like unplayable.
8041000	8050000	Like sometimes, god, bad control schemes. Haven't you ever played a game where you're like, did they even bother to play this themselves to see if this was any fun at all?
8050000	8058000	Like, did anyone actually play this to see if it was a good game? Because if anybody had actually played this, they would have seen, this is garbage.
8059000	8062000	Bomberman Act Zero, there's another great example.
8064000	8066000	How did that pass QA? I don't know.
8066000	8069000	It just didn't care. It didn't have bugs in it, let's put it out.
8069000	8071000	Clearly. Well, I don't know if it did.
8071000	8075000	That's a story for Flocko, I would think. Did he work around that time?
8075000	8080000	No, I don't think so. I don't think any of them were there at that time.
8081000	8083000	Not any of our pals.
8083000	8087000	Alright, I'm gonna do one last call for calls. OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype.
8087000	8089000	Oop, I do see it lighting up, so let's get to it.
8089000	8093000	We'll get another call in right now. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
8093000	8095000	Hey, it's Stoppy, how are you guys doing?
8095000	8097000	Hey good, Stoppy, what's up buddy?
8097000	8101000	Not much, not much. I went to PAX South last weekend, I tried out the Switch.
8101000	8103000	Oh my gosh, I wanna hear all about it.
8103000	8106000	So, well first off, before we get to the Switch, how is PAX South?
8106000	8112000	I've been harsh on PAX ever since my last one that I went to, but what was your take on PAX?
8114000	8119000	I loved it. I've been to the past two ones, so basically all the ones at PAX South.
8119000	8122000	I also went to PAX East like a few years ago.
8122000	8125000	But yeah, I just have more fun every time I go.
8125000	8128000	Just as long as you stick to the indie booths, then it's really good.
8128000	8134000	But otherwise you could stay in line for a really long time if you're trying to chase the AAA stuff.
8134000	8136000	But yeah, panels are good too.
8136000	8139000	So you did though chase down the Switch, because that's what you wanna talk about.
8139000	8140000	I did.
8140000	8142000	How long did you wait for that?
8142000	8149000	I got there on Friday, because I figured Friday was the best day to get the shortest line, so I got there early.
8149000	8155000	The doors opened at 10, and I got there at 8 so that I could wait in line.
8155000	8159000	But even getting there at 8, I did not get into the first line, the first queue.
8159000	8165000	So I was in the second one, and once they let the first queue go, they all just b-lined to the Switch.
8165000	8167000	And same with the second that I was in.
8167000	8172000	But yeah, once I got there, I just got into whatever line I could find.
8172000	8176000	And I ended up waiting almost 3 hours to play the Switch.
8176000	8178000	Wow. Yeah, see.
8178000	8182000	Wow. Okay, so you made the wait, and how was the Switch?
8182000	8185000	What did you play, and how did that experience go?
8185000	8190000	The line that I ended up in, again, I just got into whichever line I could.
8190000	8193000	Just like, okay, I just gotta get in now before it gets longer.
8193000	8196000	The line that I got into was Breath of the Wild, so that's the one that I played.
8196000	8201000	And they had a line for Breath of the Wild, and then another one for a little lounge where you got to try all the other games.
8201000	8204000	And I didn't get a chance to do that one, though.
8204000	8208000	Okay, but how was Breath of the Wild? So how was your experience with the Switch?
8208000	8213000	It was really good. I do think that it's going to be a success.
8213000	8219000	And Breath of the Wild, it was a good game. I'm not a big Zelda fan, though.
8220000	8228000	So that's kind of a good thing and a bad thing, because I guess you could take it from a non-Zelda fan that I really liked it.
8228000	8232000	So that should be a really good recommendation for Breath of the Wild, because I usually don't play Zelda games.
8232000	8238000	But this one was really, really good, so that is going to be a killer app for the Switch, I guarantee you.
8238000	8242000	It's just a really, really good game to pick up and play.
8243000	8248000	It kind of reminded me of Ico and Shadow of the Colossus, in the way that you move the character.
8248000	8253000	It didn't feel like past Zeldas, at least from the little bits of Zeldas that I've played in the past.
8253000	8260000	Now, were you playing it on the Switch as a portable system, or were you playing with a pro controller on the TV? How did that work?
8261000	8270000	Both. Because when you got to the Switch booth, well, when they put you on your console, it was already docked.
8270000	8278000	Then it had the little Joy-Cons and the grip thing. So I played it initially right there hooked up to the TV.
8278000	8283000	And then halfway through the demo, the guy working the booth, he goes up to you and he's like,
8283000	8287000	Hey, if you want to, you can take it out and then put it in portable mode. So I tried it both ways.
8287000	8294000	And I have to say that I agree 100% with you that it is intended to be a portable device.
8294000	8301000	When it was hooked up to the TV, I'm not a big graphics snob, I like playing older games.
8301000	8306000	But I could tell that there was a lot of pixelation around the characters. Very, very noticeable.
8307000	8319000	So that's going to be a problem with it, I think. It's just not meant to display on a 1080p TV.
8319000	8328000	So you could tell that there's a lot of pixelation going. Also, the textures for rocks and grass and that sort of thing,
8328000	8333000	it can be pretty muddy even if you're up close to it. It's still like a very muddy texture.
8333000	8341000	So I don't know, I'm the type that I don't really like the textures on 3DS. So maybe some Nintendo fans aren't going to mind it.
8341000	8345000	But for me it was very noticeable and it just took out like a sore thumb.
8345000	8350000	But when you're in portable mode, it seems that it's more tuned up to the portable screen.
8350000	8356000	Because on the portable screen it was very impressive. It was just amazing. The screen quality was great on the portable.
8357000	8365000	Very interesting. I like the affirmation that I might be on to something with my whole thinking as a portable system.
8365000	8373000	How do those controllers feel? Because they look a little small, but did it feel good playing with the Joy-Cons?
8373000	8381000	They're smaller than you think they are. When you get it, you're going to be really freaked out that they're just so small.
8381000	8387000	You can basically pick it up with one hand and it will just fit within your five fingers.
8387000	8390000	Well, it's not the size, it's how you use it.
8390000	8402000	Exactly, exactly. One of the things I was concerned with was that I didn't like that the controls...
8403000	8406000	Nintendo is the only one doing it with the controls that are parallel.
8406000	8412000	Where you have an analog stick sitting right underneath the face buttons.
8412000	8416000	So that's something that really concerned me because that's not how thumbs work.
8416000	8419000	It's not going to feel right when you're controlling it.
8419000	8422000	But I was pleasantly surprised. It actually feels really good.
8422000	8429000	I was worried that if you press B that it's going to press the right analog stick, but it didn't do that at all.
8429000	8439000	It seems that, at least when I was holding it, when I was pressing B, it seems that that little nook in your thumb,
8439000	8446000	like when you have your thumb kind of arched, that's kind of like where the analog stick falls under.
8446000	8451000	So it's kind of weird to explain it, but it doesn't get in the way the way that they've designed it.
8451000	8457000	I don't know if that was intentional or if people with bigger hands, bigger fingers are going to have a problem with that.
8457000	8461000	But for me it just felt comfortable, so that was very reassuring.
8461000	8466000	But the D-pad is terrible. It's awful, just like we suspected it would be.
8466000	8471000	So that's going to be a problem, but the way that I see it, we're kind of in a post-D-pad world.
8471000	8476000	There's not a lot of games that strictly use the D-pad, so I don't think it's going to hold down the hardware.
8476000	8483000	But it is something that if you have a retro game or a game on the eShop or whatever virtual console,
8483000	8488000	you're not going to want to play it with a Switch controller, at least not the one that comes out of the box with it.
8488000	8493000	Yeah, that's right. They've had that with the one that they've shown already in the patent stuff,
8493000	8497000	where it's going to have an actual classic D-pad on it.
8497000	8498000	Exactly, exactly.
8498000	8500000	It's a separate thing for 40 bucks.
8500000	8505000	Oh, boy. Or the $70 Joy-Con or something like that. I'm sorry, not Joy-Con, Pro Controller.
8505000	8507000	Definitely, definitely.
8508000	8514000	Oh, boy. All right, well, anything else from PAX South we should know about? Thank you, though, for the rundown on the Switch.
8514000	8519000	I'm looking forward to getting one in my hands, even if it is a little small. I can't wait to work with it.
8519000	8526000	Yeah, I think you're going to like it, and I think Lucky did make a mistake when he canceled his pre-order.
8526000	8533000	It's going to be big, and like I said, Zelda is going to be a killer app, so it convinced me, and I'm not a Zelda fan.
8533000	8536000	I think he's going to regret that cancellation right there.
8536000	8537000	Yeah, but do you have a Wii U?
8537000	8544000	Another thing for Lucky, a PSVR. Try out a game that's going to come out called Static. It is amazing.
8544000	8547000	I tried that over at PAX South, too, and it's absolutely amazing.
8547000	8549000	I'll have to check it out. Do you have a Wii U?
8549000	8555000	No, I don't. I'm not a big fan of Nintendo hardware. I'm not even going to get the Switch at launch,
8555000	8560000	so I'm really going to wait for another iteration of the console, because, like you said, with the D-pad,
8561000	8567000	I just don't think that it's the best iteration of the hardware right now, and as I see it,
8567000	8572000	every portable Nintendo console that succeeded has always had a second iteration that was better,
8572000	8574000	so I'm just waiting for that instead.
8574000	8575000	Okay.
8575000	8582000	All right. Well, Stoppy, thank you so much for the rundown on PAX South. I appreciate it, and we'll check in with you again
8582000	8586000	once you do pick up a Switch and get converted to Zelda fandom.
8586000	8589000	Of course. All right, catch you later. Thanks.
8589000	8591000	Take care. Yep. Bye.
8591000	8595000	All right. What to do? I didn't see anybody else trying to ring through the line,
8595000	8602000	but I will keep it open for just a hot minute at Orange Launch Radio on Skype if you want to give us a call.
8602000	8606000	Loki, do you think you will end up regretting that?
8606000	8610000	No, I'm not going to regret it, because there's nothing out except for Zelda at launch.
8610000	8616000	Like I said, I can't justify buying a system for $400 for one game that I have a system already
8616000	8620000	that I can play that game on, so I will pick it up when it comes out on the Wii U.
8622000	8632000	So, I don't know. I'm checking out this really cool animated gif right now of someone playing a version of Portal on HoloLens in Augmented Reality.
8632000	8634000	Oh, cool. I liked HoloLens.
8634000	8638000	That looks fucking sweet. I know it's like a little...
8638000	8642000	It's like you're playing it in the real world, so they're launching portals against walls in their own house,
8642000	8649000	or like office building. It looks like it's an office building, and throwing a companion cube through it, and it's interacting with the environment.
8649000	8652000	Okay, that's pretty rad. That's pretty rad.
8652000	8659000	I liked the time I got to spend with HoloLens when Bobby brought his dev thingy over to DragonCon.
8659000	8660000	I'll swing this around.
8660000	8664000	I'd like to see what it's going to look like a year later, for sure.
8664000	8668000	Okay, so this is a little bit of what it looks like.
8668000	8672000	Oh, that's really cool. Oh, you can actually just put the portals anywhere in the room.
8672000	8676000	It must be one of those things that must scan the room to look for the walls and all that stuff first.
8676000	8679000	That's really cool. I like that.
8679000	8681000	Yeah, because this is a radio show.
8681000	8682000	I'll post it in chat.
8682000	8688000	You guys can't see it, even for those listening on the podcast feed, because with the football game today, I'm sure a lot of people are listening on the podcast feed.
8688000	8697000	It's like they are putting the portals on actual walls in this stairwell, in this living room, and so forth, which is what the HoloLens kind of does.
8697000	8702000	It scans the room and turns the room into a playground or something like that.
8702000	8709000	Anyhow, that's it. No other calls are coming in on Skype, so I think we are going to wrap it up tonight.
8709000	8716000	Things have been a little bit quieter around here with the football game going on, so that's it.
8716000	8718000	I think we're going to wrap up right there.
8718000	8725000	Let's go around, and first, let me thank everybody for being here, tuning in live over at Orange Lounge Radio.
8726000	8732000	If you like what you heard here at the show, please leave us a nice five-star review on iTunes or wherever you found this show.
8732000	8733000	That goes a long way.
8733000	8737000	Tell a friend or two about the show, because word of mouth is all we got.
8737000	8747000	We don't have a big million-dollar website behind us or anything like that, so we really appreciate all the kind referrals and so forth.
8747000	8752000	Otherwise, I think we're about done, so let's get to everybody's final thought.
8752000	8754000	Loki, we'll start with you, your final thought tonight.
8754000	8758000	The next six weeks are going to be pretty exciting. Can't talk about it, though, but it's going to be exciting.
8758000	8762000	You're just going to talk about it in vague terms.
8762000	8772000	I haven't yet signed an NDA, but I'm going to have to soon, so once I actually start working on stuff, but it'll be exciting.
8772000	8779000	And fortunately, I can't really talk about it, because that also unveils what my actual profession is.
8779000	8783000	Don't forget, Palmer Luck, he just had to pay $500 million for that whole thing.
8783000	8786000	Okay, well that's not compete stuff.
8786000	8788000	That has nothing to do with it, but yeah.
8788000	8789000	Alright, alright, alright.
8789000	8792000	Dark Saga, your final thought tonight.
8792000	8794000	Resist.
8794000	8802000	And my final thought tonight is, now I'm thinking about arcade cabinets in this house.
8802000	8808000	Not even just the $20 things that Dark Saga was talking about, but I know there's that.
8808000	8810000	There is an arcade cabinet.
8811000	8817000	And that's really cool, don't get me wrong, but I'm talking about a full-on burger time machine or something.
8817000	8823000	I don't have many regrets in life, but letting that burger time machine go when I saw it at the auction, it's one of my few regrets in life.
8823000	8825000	We might have a line on another baby Pac-Man.
8825000	8828000	Really? Wait, do you have a baby Pac-Man already?
8828000	8829000	No.
8829000	8834000	We're trying to get one. I'm hoping, but they're kind of pricey.
8834000	8837000	Fingers crossed. Toes crossed, too.
8837000	8843000	That's it. Have a good night. We will see you next time in seven days to talk about next week's news. Until then, bye.
8867000	8869000	See you next week.
8897000	8899000	See you next week.
