00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
This week, show your F5 key some love as E3 opens ticket sales up to 1,000 attendees and probably 14,000 bots and scalpers.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
There's plenty more news that respects your personal space, and we'll tell you about it starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 675 for this February the 12th of 2017.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:53,000
My name is Rob Roberts, here to talk with you about video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle with my co-host and studio, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yo.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Hi, how are you, Jamie?

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm okay.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Good. This is going to be really out of character for the show because we try to focus on games, although personal life stuff comes into character.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
But I do need to get this out because we are a live show, so we watch things that are unfolding live.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I don't think we have any listeners that I know of in this part of California, but just north of here in an area where I actually lived for a few years,

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:27,000
they're evacuating the town of Oroville all the way down to Marysville right now, I think, which these are not giant cities in California.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Marysville is a pretty sizable city, so is Oroville.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It's, well, Oroville was evacuated, people are still on the road though. Marysville, Hallwood, Olivehurst, Plumas Lake, and Wheatland.

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So what's happening is that California, you know, we've been in a drought for several years and we just got a crap ton of rain the past month.

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And it's like a lot, a lot, a lot of rain. It was like, they say 200% of normal or something like that is all falling at once.

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So what's happened is that Lake Oroville has filled up so much and I guess now all these problems are starting to show with the emergency spillway.

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
They just put out an alert at 4 o'clock that said the emergency spillway is going to break in 60 minutes.

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And so they've evacuated all these. But if you just go to news.google and search for Oroville, O-R-O, which is gold in Spanish, Ville, just look for that.

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And that's what we're kind of watching tonight. So Dark Soccer is kind of going to half watch that for us.

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Just in case, because I know people in those areas from Ingress and just real life other stuff too.

25
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
But if any of our friends in the area are listening.

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Yes, you need to leave. Now, turn off the show and go.

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Well unless you're listening on your phone and are already in your car.

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Then fine.

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
But the instructions have been to evacuate North Torchico.

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So.

31
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
There you go.

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Head for high ground.

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Thoughts, sir. I hope it's just one of those things you're doing out of an abundance of caution and won't actually end up being chaotic.

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Because the way it's sounding over the past 60 minutes, this is not good.

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm going to point out something.

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Having been from the Gulf Coast, this is what our taxes are supposed to go for.

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Is to repair things and take care of it.

38
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So don't ever want to hear anybody complaining about paying your taxes.

39
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Because all of this evacuation that you're dealing with right now, these people are basically coming together to get people to safe ground.

40
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
This is why you pay taxes.

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So.

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
To keep this stuff in good repair, which I remember the debate that went on over the levees in New Orleans.

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And we know what happened there.

44
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I just, I really hope they have the money to do what they need to do to keep people safe right now.

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Exactly. And also, action does better than thoughts and prayers.

46
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
All right, Techmaster Loki, how are you tonight? Sorry.

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm fine.

48
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I want to make sure we got that out here at the top of the show, just in case.

49
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I don't, again, we may have somebody in Marysville, though, I'm thinking.

50
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Especially back from the DDR days, we definitely knew people up there.

51
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So, anyway.

52
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
But how are you, Techmaster Loki?

53
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm fine.

54
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Yeah, how was your week?

55
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Different, I should say.

56
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yeah, that's right.

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You're kind of, your job isn't changing, but you're doing, like, one of those, like, what is it, like an internship at your job?

58
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Sort of.

59
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It's like a temporary thing?

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Yeah, like a six-week rotation at an innovation lab.

61
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
But I know, and I know you can't, you can't really talk about the details, but...

62
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
There really aren't any details to talk about, but yeah, even if I had details, I can't really talk about them.

63
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Just to say, though, it would be in, like, the realm of gaming, so there is something in that.

64
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
But, yeah, I can't really talk about it, because not really anything to talk about yet. It's more of just kind of research.

65
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
All right, well, I hope it's something in the future we'll get to know you had a part of.

66
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Yeah, but it's cool, though, because I get access to the hacker lab down there, so I got to take a soldering class today.

67
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Oh, fun!

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Or yesterday, so I've finally been able to break myself of all my bad soldering habits, and now I can actually solder correctly, and I'm so happy about that.

69
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Yeah, time to mod those old systems now.

70
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Yeah, I can fix stuff now.

71
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Yeah, hacker lab is pretty cool. I just went there for the first time.

72
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
They're opening one in Rancho.

73
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Are they really?

74
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And I'm super excited about that. I was like, yes!

75
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I just went there for the first time a couple weeks ago, thanks to IGDA here in SAC, who asked me to host a panel, and I was tweeting about it.

76
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I got to interview these guys that were with a company called T Cubed, which made this, it's not an actual mobile game, it's an actual physical game that they've made, and is gaining popularity very fast.

77
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
They're kind of having to deal with all this growth, so we're kind of talking about how that grew and all that stuff.

78
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So that was my introduction to hacker lab, was doing a panel kind of about gaming, except it wasn't about the game itself, it was more about the business side of things, but it was still very fascinating.

79
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Yeah, it's kind of nice, because during the few weeks that I'm down there, we basically have full access to that, so I can take any of the classes that they have for free, so that's kind of nice.

80
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So, of course, I went there and I built a couple electronic kits, really basic shit.

81
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:49,000
But it was fun to be able to actually do it correctly. It's like, holy shit, I've been doing this completely wrong this entire time.

82
00:05:50,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I doubt they even sell these anymore, because they're probably dangerous, but back in the 80s, when I was younger and I was a kid, they used to have these basic electronic boards where you could put the little wires in the springs and make very simple, light breadboards.

83
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Yeah, is that still a thing that kids can do? Okay, I figured they probably caught fire to somebody's house, they don't sell anymore.

84
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
No, they've got a little fancier stuff now, they have almost blocks that you can build from.

85
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I feel like I would still play with those as an adult.

86
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You could still play with those as an adult, a lot of people prototype on that stuff.

87
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You could make a radio transmitter with that stuff, it would only go from one bedroom to another for legal reasons, FCC reasons.

88
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:33,000
But I'm sure it would be very easy to mod if you wanted to do dirty, but not that I'd ever encourage that.

89
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
No, it was just kind of fun to be able to do that, so I took that class and, yeah, I can solder, so it's fantastic.

90
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Half the problem I was having with soldering is my equipment is just shit, and because I was doing everything wrong, it made it even shittier.

91
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I just need to buy a new soldering iron and some better equipment and I'm good to go.

92
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Let's get into video game news. I know we've been talking about natural disasters and hacker lab, which at least is a little closer to gaming.

93
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Let's get into some of the big topics this week. This has been a very busy week for gaming news.

94
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
The beginning of the year was pretty empty and I feel like we got a lot that hit this week, so let's jump right into it.

95
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I think this is something that has been on a lot of people's minds this week as they've been reading gaming blogs,

96
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:22,000
but if you aren't already aware, E3 has made the announcement this week that they will be going public, partially.

97
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:29,000
So this is something that some people have been asking E3 to do for a long time, akin to what the Tokyo Game Show does,

98
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
but the way E3 has chosen to implement this is going to be a little bit different.

99
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Starting, I think tomorrow is the big day, they are going to sell 15,000 tickets at a price of, I believe it is $150 for the first thousand,

100
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:49,000
and $250 for the rest, and that price, I think they said it was like $150 for the first day only,

101
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:56,000
but let's be real, those tickets will be gone tomorrow. They will be gone within 10 minutes tomorrow, if that.

102
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:06,000
But anyway, so that is going to be opened up to 15,000. That 15,000 is in addition to essentially who they're already letting in.

103
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:14,000
But, then this causes this question of, well, wait a minute, the LA Convention Center can only physically hold because of Fire Code,

104
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,000
so many people, so is this going to be a situation of these 15,000 people are coming from somewhere else?

105
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I do remember last year, we seemed like we saw the ESA and E3 kind of dipping their toe in the water with this, with the whole like...

106
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
E4 All.

107
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
What was the thing they were doing like the...

108
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
E4 All.

109
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, not even that. I mean, that was a different type of experiment.

110
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm talking about like the whole like, they invited the super users, the super consumers, pro, prosumers, I think they were called,

111
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:51,000
they invited to the show last year. Like, remember it was like, if you were an exhibitor, you could give like a hundred of your fans access to E3.

112
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It sounded very much like the way we got into E3 the very, very, very first year we went,

113
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:06,000
because we had a company that we were promoting pretty heavily at the time that wanted to see us at E3 because they had relevant products, right?

114
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:13,000
So, and we haven't had friends that work at said company, so it kind of all worked out. I think they did that last year, if I remember right.

115
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So, because I remember last year we were having these conversations about there's going to be more and more fans and we kind of see things heading this direction.

116
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And why don't they just open it up to the public? But here we go. Now they're going to open up to the public.

117
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
So I'm assuming this is to partially replace said prosumer thing.

118
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:36,000
But I mean, if we at OLR had a hope to go to E3 at all, that would have been shot in the foot with this whole thing.

119
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
We're going to have to buy a ticket just like anyone else if we want to go at all.

120
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I still feel the same, like nothing, my perception on E3 as opposed to a year or even two years ago hasn't really changed much.

121
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I feel like the last times I've been to E3, I'm very fortunate to have gone.

122
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I've had a great time at the shows I've gone to, but I started to see towards the end where it was like, I'm just getting like a press release live.

123
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:10,000
E3 is so much of a controlled environment and part of that control is just going online now.

124
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It's being broadcast direct on Twitch TV, on YouTube, on Geoff Keighley's, whoever he's partnering with this year.

125
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Which this year actually is the ESA he's partnering with. But anyway, Dark Saga.

126
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
EA is irrelevant.

127
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
EA electronic cards?

128
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Not EA, sorry, E3.

129
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
E3 is irrelevant.

130
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
E3 is irrelevant.

131
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
There's a lot of people that say E3 is irrelevant. Why do you feel E3 is irrelevant?

132
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It's been irrelevant for years because we would always get, I mean, especially with the advent of, you know, a more accessible Internet, like you were saying, we're getting it all the same time everybody else is.

133
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You know, you may get some of the networking there, but that only really does you good if you are in a media capacity or in the industry.

134
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Other than that, and for the people who were going for goodies, it's not even that good for that anymore either.

135
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
So it's just, there's no more joy to it.

136
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I don't, I don't know if I would use the word irrelevant seems so strong, but I definitely still have some similar those feelings.

137
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I think what's happened is that E3 has been diluted.

138
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I think it's kind of one way I would put E3 has been diluted because E3 used to be the gamer Christmas and it still is to some extent because of all the press conferences.

139
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Microsoft's still doing their thing. Sony's still doing their thing.

140
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Nintendo, they started to drift from this a couple of years ago, but for all practical purposes, they still do their own thing around the time of E3.

141
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:40,000
So, I mean, E3 is still a holiday, so a weird nerd holiday in some events.

142
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
But what I mean by the whole diluted thing is that E3 was like that one time a year when that happened.

143
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Well, that went away because now, you know, let's take Sony for example.

144
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Sony's done very well with their PlayStation Expo that they do in December.

145
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:04,000
So which is coincidentally, but probably not exactly six months out from E3 is when Sony tends to do their other show, the PlayStation Expo now.

146
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,000
And they have a great success with that and getting out a lot of big messages and getting a lot of press during that time.

147
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And I think Nintendo, part of the reason they changed their tune significantly a couple years ago to the Nintendo Directs and what they were doing is that they found that taking their message directly to their very rabid fan base was going to be more beneficial than having just the cynics show up to play the games.

148
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:38,000
See, that's why I think that it's irrelevant now. You don't need it anymore. It's redundant. It's redundant.

149
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It's not necessary to have it anymore. It's really just random hype fest. And now you can get these things directly from the developers.

150
00:12:47,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It's probably more cost effective for the developers themselves to do their own little gig rather than have a big, you know, presentation and have to compete with the other developers there on the floor.

151
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:08,000
If you do it yourself, you control the output, you control the cost, and you control the message.

152
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Let's go to our live chatters. Hi, guys. We do tape live, of course, every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

153
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:28,000
And we do have, you know, again, we don't have 50,000 people that listen to this show, but the group that we do have that shows up week after week, we love you guys.

154
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You're our Sunday night fam. Thank you guys for being here as always. And let's get some of your comments read in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

155
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:49,000
SHO 100 Matt says, Pax sells out in 20 minutes. This will sell out in five, if that. Ain't that the truth. Pax fits way more than 15,000 people and they've been having ticket issues and scalpers.

156
00:13:49,000 --> 00:14:01,000
You know, I loved Jason's tongue in cheek intro tonight. It was a little bit sassy, but I think it was accurate. You're going to have maybe a thousand actual people that want to go to E3 getting tickets and then 14,000 scalpers.

157
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:16,000
It's all right. After they go to E3, they're not going to want to go to E3. Probably. I mean, I mean, what we've said, you know, honestly, like having gone to it, a lot of the stuff, it seemed like every year more and more gets behind closed doors.

158
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:30,000
And you don't think if you got that general mission pass that you're going to see any of that stuff. You may get to play some games, but honestly, I feel I get more information out of just watching the stuff online and hearing, seeing the press releases,

159
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
because while you're there, you miss a ton of stuff because it's just a lot to take in.

160
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Right. Well, I'm, you know what, and I don't want to keep like poo-pooing on the E3 and my experiences and the reasons why I chose to stop going to E3.

161
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Like if you're out there and you're listening and you're going to fight for one of these 15,000 tickets, and if you do end up winning one of the spots and you get to go or what have you, have a great time.

162
00:14:52,000 --> 00:15:06,000
And I would be very curious what the show is like, because regardless, as desperate as this move feels to me to keep E3 that big event thing that is going to get people talking about or what have you,

163
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:20,000
it's going to be a year of transformation for E3, akin to when they went to the airport for those two years and then when they left the airport, or even if you want to go way back when they went to LA in the first place from Atlanta.

164
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I mean, this is going to be a big change for E3. So, I mean, for better or for worse, it could be a very different show this year because of it.

165
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:41,000
And maybe I'll be like, shit, I should have really tried to go this year. But, you know, I do have to kind of weigh in my mind, well, the money that it costs to, because again, E3, they didn't put it on a weekend.

166
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Even though they're opening it up to the public, they didn't put it on a weekend now. So, you're going to have to give up your whole week if you want to travel to E3 and do all that stuff.

167
00:15:49,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Just a reminder, too, this is the show that we're talking about. Everything else that happens at E3, the parties, the press conferences, those are separate from this thing that you're looking at.

168
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Also EA and anybody else that may be around.

169
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Oh, yeah, we haven't heard of that. If EA is going to do their thing across the street or if they're going to, because of this transformation, maybe EA is going to come back. I don't know.

170
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Or Activision, I think Activision was separate from it.

171
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Activision hasn't been for a little while. Well, Activision is a weird area. Activision has been on the show floor, but they still rent the space upstairs to invite...

172
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
They also still have their stuff in other booths, maybe?

173
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Well, sure, yeah. Things would show up in Microsoft or Sony's booth, but they still have their space upstairs for their invite only really early, early announcements that are going to be weeks and months down the line under non-disclosure agreements.

174
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Things that aren't necessarily to be announced the week of the show.

175
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:59,000
But anyway, if you guys get tickets, cool. I'll be curious to see how the show is. I kind of feel like the ticket sales are going to be a complete and utter clusterfuck tomorrow.

176
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
But we'll see. Maybe I'll be wrong. Maybe those that are going will have a great time.

177
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I know our pals over at GameBooey.org, we're talking about possibly using this to go to the show.

178
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And so if they're able to go, I think I would fucking love to hear Spike's perspective, because he went to E3 years ago.

179
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
And so if he gets to go again under this, I would love to hear his perspective on it.

180
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I don't see why our friends from Electric Sisterhood wouldn't try to go again.

181
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
E3 was the one time of year I could only ever see those guys.

182
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
So if they get to go this year, I'd be very curious to see what they think.

183
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
And their thoughts on the show are different than mine, and that's cool.

184
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I just look at it and go, okay, so the week I could spend doing E3, I could also go to MAGFest.

185
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Or I could go to a smaller IndieCon or DragonCon or something else.

186
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I'm just like, you know, I only have so much money. I would rather spend it on this right now.

187
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I do want to take time off, though, so I can watch the press conferences on the couch with popcorn.

188
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Do you?

189
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Because that's the best.

190
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
So there is still that holiday event to it.

191
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I love the press conferences. I mean, they're fun to make fun of.

192
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Ubisoft's going to be Ubisoft.

193
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:15,000
But no, I like all that stuff, but my god, I don't want to go back there and play those games.

194
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Unless I had something like I really, really wanted to play, you know, like a New Saints Row or something.

195
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
But that's not going to fucking happen.

196
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I don't know. I'm fine with watching the videos and watching the livestreams and just living vicariously through that.

197
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I'm going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Dungeonbuster points out, no panels, no game rooms, no contests.

198
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
It's a straight up trade event.

199
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Yeah, I mean, again, unless they are going to announce something we haven't heard yet, E3 is not going to be like PAX.

200
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:55,000
And with as hard of a time as I've given PAX and its growing pains and its issues and some of the reasons why I don't go to PAX either.

201
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I still think that, like, I think what a lot of people probably are expecting to see at E3, they're probably really going to see at PAX.

202
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
You know what I mean?

203
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:16,000
So I just... E3 is not going to have classic gaming rooms or jammed spaces or, you know, again, unless they decide to announce some things later on.

204
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:23,000
We have heard, and I'll mention this, there's some type of partnership with Geoff Keighley, because everybody wants to partner with him.

205
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
That he's going to do some type of panel leading thing.

206
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
So I guess they're trying to come up with where can we encourage these 15,000 peoples to go.

207
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:44,000
But again, in this day and age of these conventions live streaming their panels online, do I need to go all the way to E3 just to see a panel?

208
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I'm not sure. So, we'll see what happens with that.

209
00:19:50,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Loki, any thoughts on how E3 might change this year in contrast to years past?

210
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Lines might be longer.

211
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Ain't that the truth.

212
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I mean, that's all I can think of. If they're trying to keep it packed, it's just that the lines are long.

213
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I don't know. I don't know what the advantage is for them other than making up lost revenue.

214
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I think what's going to be interesting to see happen is that, you know, you've got these 15,000 people that will be going to E3, and we do live in an age of social media everywhere.

215
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Is the ESA trying to do this to try to get the buzz on that level? The more like homegrown hashtags and social media trends?

216
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
But do they need that?

217
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I was going to say, maybe because I'm ingrained in that stuff, but I think that it seems like the buzz is already there.

218
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,000
It's not like people... I mean, people that don't know what E3 is, they probably don't give a shit about what E3 is.

219
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It's not like, oh, there's a gaming convention that tells me about games in the industry and stuff.

220
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I don't think that people really are going to care if that's...

221
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:18,000
And if they wanted to do that, why didn't they just open it up again to more independent journalists to be able to go?

222
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
And people that at least have an active interest in that.

223
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,000
And I just want... I'm not... I still feel the same about E3. I'm not going to go, even if they were to do that.

224
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
So I don't want you thinking, like, oh, Rob's just bitter because he doesn't...

225
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:46,000
It's not that, but why not try to invite 15,000 people that want to be able to write about it and promote it in their various YouTube, podcasts, blog, and all that type of stuff?

226
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I don't... Why just 15,000 people that want to be able to say they went to E3?

227
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:03,000
They're just probably trying to make up the numbers. Maybe they feel that that's where they projected that they're going to be falling under that amount.

228
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
And this way they can make it up instead of giving out free passes like they may have done in the past.

229
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Although I would assume that those tickets have to be covered by the companies that are going.

230
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I mean, it's just... It's revenue for them.

231
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
All right. Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, S2100Matt says,

232
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
To be honest, I wouldn't be surprised if you see fewer demos at E3 on the floor.

233
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Most of the demos for the new games that people want to see will be appointment only or specially monitored demos.

234
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
That was already happening.

235
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
That was part of the problems. That was already happening.

236
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
And it was like there's less and less.

237
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:51,000
And, you know, I just like I kind of got sick of the whole wait in a line to go in a theater to watch somebody else play a walkthrough that was already published on YouTube hours before you got in the line.

238
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Like that was the... If I could put my finger on like one or two sentences on why I don't go to E3 anymore, that is it.

239
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
That is why I don't bother with E3 anymore.

240
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
That and Paris Hilton.

241
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
No, I still went for a couple of years after the Paris Hilton year.

242
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
But that's the whole reason.

243
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Why would I fucking stand in a line to go in a theater to watch what you just watched on YouTube two hours ago?

244
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
And Capcom fucking hates us.

245
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Well, that's a whole other issue.

246
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Oh, they're not the only ones, Loki. Come on.

247
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Come on. Remember when we had the threatening emails from Namco? Come on.

248
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Where have you been?

249
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
All right. Anyway.

250
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,000
CMYK in chat says, remember that year when you could download demos of games shown off at E3?

251
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Exactly. That was awesome.

252
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
That was the best.

253
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Exactly. That was thankfully Capcom. Thank you, Capcom.

254
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Because they did MotoGP06 and The Lost Planet and there was one other one, but I don't remember what it was.

255
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
But yeah, that was awesome.

256
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:58,000
That's what I think they should do is like put out a demo, release it out there so people can experience that shit at home.

257
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Fucking great idea.

258
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
But they're not going to do that anymore.

259
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
All right. Anything else you want to say on E3, Dark Sakura?

260
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Fuck it.

261
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Are you going to watch it at all though? Do you still partake in the news conferences and all that stuff?

262
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Not really. I don't like getting disconnected every five minutes.

263
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
It's true. There's all the bandwidth problems.

264
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I just let someone else live stream it. I mean, not the stream, but live tweet it and then I get what I want.

265
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Yeah.

266
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
And I'm happy.

267
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Okay.

268
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
And I'll have to listen to people droning on and on when I could be doing other stuff.

269
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
You just want the bullet points. Like just show me the ones like PowerPoints.

270
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Exactly. Give me the meeting minutes.

271
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
That's how Dark Sakura is going to approach E3 in the future. Just give me a copy of the minutes.

272
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I'm not going to show up to the meeting. Just send me the minutes.

273
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,000
It's like, I don't have time for this. I am needed over at Bethesda right the fuck now.

274
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Give it to me. And here's my email. Send me the minute.

275
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I like that. Just send me the bullet points and the action items.

276
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
My card is just going to say IDGAF minutes, please.

277
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
You could probably, maybe you could ask.

278
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I want it as a keynote presentation.

279
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Why don't you get some of the IGDA cards from our pals at SacIGDA and just add the letter F on it.

280
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Of course, they might not appreciate that. And hopefully they're not out there listening.

281
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Wasn't it like IGDA?

282
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Yeah, it is.

283
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
So I give don't a fuck. Yoda.

284
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Yeah, you're just Yoda.

285
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:41,000
All right. Let's get into our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

286
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
So we'll start with you Dark Sakura. What types of video games have you been playing this week?

287
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Wow.

288
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Lots and lots of wow?

289
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Lots and lots of wow.

290
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I really, Dan finally gave up on Mega Man 2.5D because it's, it's, it's really, it can be a pain.

291
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,000
But there's a new release of it out now, a new patch version, so might redownload it.

292
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:11,000
But it's really just been, I've been so busy this week that I just, I just played wow.

293
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Oh, oh, oh, wait, wait, wait. No, I've started playing Bust A Move again on my iPhone.

294
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I fucking love Bust A Move.

295
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Bust, oh, wait. Sorry, I'm thinking-

296
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Puzzle Bobble.

297
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Yeah, sorry. I got excited for a minute.

298
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
But I super, super love Puzzle Bobble.

299
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:33,000
And I have been playing the crap out of it again on this like everlasting challenge mode.

300
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
You just play and play and play and play until you just can't play anymore.

301
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
And that's how I like to play that game.

302
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
So it's been pretty fun.

303
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:50,000
And, um, yeah, I think really that's it because, you know, we played something else.

304
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I don't remember.

305
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
All right.

306
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Not much.

307
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
All right, well, if it's that important-

308
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Oh yeah, Link to the Past, duh.

309
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
How could you forget about Zelda?

310
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Old.

311
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Old.

312
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Oh, because you're old?

313
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
No.

314
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
That's just the reasons. It's because of reasons.

315
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I don't care. I need the minutes.

316
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
All right.

317
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

318
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,000
So my gaming week consisted of, um, actually some things I haven't played normally.

319
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Um, so we did, uh, as part of our immersion project into what I'm doing at, you know, my side job thing right now.

320
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Is, uh, we had a Smash Melee tournament.

321
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Oh, you mentioned this last week.

322
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
That you were going to participate in this.

323
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Yes, I was going to participate in this.

324
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:42,000
The issue, though, with it is, it was a Smash Melee tournament on emulators.

325
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Which sucked ass, because the, uh, input lag was just fucking horrible.

326
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
So I did my best. I got third place.

327
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
So that was all right.

328
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
That's still not bad for somebody.

329
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Didn't you say last week you don't really ever play?

330
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I don't normally play.

331
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
There you go.

332
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
The guy that- there's only three gamers in our group.

333
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
So that's why I got third.

334
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Oh, so you got third place out of the three gamers. Good job.

335
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
So, I mean, but we played against people that, you know, worked down there.

336
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,000
And, uh, you know, the one guy who won, he plays Smash all the time.

337
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
So it's like, okay, well shit.

338
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
You know, there's no way it would be that.

339
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
And everyone fucking horrid Peach.

340
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Just like, it was fucking a Peach fest all over.

341
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
So I played Kirby.

342
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Peach is a good character.

343
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I played Kirby and then I did Mario.

344
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Because they didn't have any of their characters unlocked, so.

345
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,000
And I didn't pick a fast character like Fox because, like I said, input lag was shit.

346
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
And so you'd just be flying off the goddamn side of the map.

347
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Super easy, so.

348
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
That's a little silly they used emulators, though.

349
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Yeah.

350
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
So, anyways.

351
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Um, and then I, you know, did some PlayStation VR stuff because I was showing it off.

352
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
So I got to play a little bit of, um, Until Dawn, Rush of Blood.

353
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Still love that game.

354
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
It's just such a great game.

355
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Um, I got to try a little bit.

356
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Um, I played the demo of, um, what was that, Eve Valkyrie again.

357
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Still love that demo.

358
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Not paying $60 for the game, though.

359
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
And then, um, let's see.

360
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I also, of course, played a ton of Skyrim Remastered.

361
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Um, I don't know if I mentioned it before that I completely restarted my game.

362
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
So before I was playing with a ton of mods and it was ridiculous.

363
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Now I'm playing without mods and just playing through the game.

364
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Of course, I've already power leveled my character using glitches that were in the vanilla game.

365
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
So I'm already done there.

366
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,000
So back up to Godlike again and just going to run through all the different quests that are in there.

367
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
But I kind of like it because it's a little bit more of a challenge.

368
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
So I'm really enjoying that still.

369
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
And Skyrim, like, infinite amount of replayability.

370
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
So, um, looking forward to that and still playing quests I haven't played before.

371
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Even though I've played the game, like, several times.

372
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Um, and then, of course, a little bit of Ingress just because now I'm working in a completely different area.

373
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
So, you know, all those uniques and stuff.

374
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
And it's also concentrated down there.

375
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,000
But because of that, it's also so chaotic that people just drive by everything.

376
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
So, I don't know.

377
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
But, yeah, that's pretty much it.

378
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Awesome.

379
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Um, my gaming week was very potpourri.

380
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I played a little bit of everything.

381
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Of course, I'm still continuing to play, like, Final Fantasy XIV, my old standbys.

382
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Overwatch, I still play.

383
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Um, even though we were fighting for a little bit over the capture the flag thing,

384
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I just stopped playing capture the flag and got a lot better.

385
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Um, I still love me some Mystery Heroes.

386
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
That's kind of my go-to mode right now when I play with Alan or some of our other friends.

387
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Um, uh, otherwise, I played a little bit of Rez this week.

388
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
The newer one on PlayStation 4.

389
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Because I still was trying to get Area X unlocked.

390
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Uh, because I need to get to that.

391
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
But then I got distracted, like, actually just playing through the game.

392
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
So, uh, that was fun.

393
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Uh, and then, um, I also on PlayStation 4 was playing, uh, randomly Pac-Man Championship Edition 2 again.

394
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
And just playing, you know, just some stuff in my backlog on PlayStation 4.

395
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,000
And then the other night, extremely randomly, very extremely randomly, um,

396
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,000
you know Alan is super into Morrowind and Skyrim, right? Elder Scrolls, right?

397
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
He played Skyrim, like, a lot.

398
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Yeah.

399
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
And then he just finished Morrowind, right?

400
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
So, um, and he, you know, likes to mod the shit out of that.

401
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
So, he just moved on now.

402
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I think he's getting ready to start Oblivion.

403
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Although, I feel like for the past three nights, he's been setting up his mods in Oblivion.

404
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
He hasn't been playing Oblivion, he's just been setting up his mods in Oblivion.

405
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
So he can play the game the way that he wants to.

406
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:33,000
But then that whole talk kind of made me realize, like, oh yeah, Oblivion recently went backwards compatible on Xbox One.

407
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
And I never installed it.

408
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
So, and then, one of our mutual friends was over here on Friday night.

409
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,000
And is also, that friend happens to also be a big fan of Elder Scrolls and that whole series.

410
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
And so it was like, alright, let's just play Oblivion on Xbox One.

411
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Let's do, like, go back through the game.

412
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Because I wanted to see, you know, I haven't played that game in so long.

413
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I was like, ooh, TV with a high refresh rate and then the, you know, whatever.

414
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:04,000
So, I gotta say, graphically, it still holds up pretty well for an Xbox 360 game that plays on Xbox One.

415
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
And, you know, we played through it with the whole little introductory dungeon getting out.

416
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I would still like to see, like, the remastered versions of Oblivion and Morrowind.

417
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Because Morrowind wasn't on console. I think, was it on Xbox, the original Xbox?

418
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
The original Xbox, yeah.

419
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
So, I mean, that would be cool to see, like, a remastered version, like, in the Skyrim engine or something like that.

420
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Yeah, yeah, but I don't think those are going to be.

421
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Well, there is the whole, I don't know if you know.

422
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
The mod, yeah, the mod that they're making.

423
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Well, no, not just that, but the whole Elder Scrolls Online.

424
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Their next expansion is Morrowind.

425
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
So, I'm not, I mean, again, obviously it's not going to be the exact same thing.

426
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
But it's going to be revisiting a lot of that.

427
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Elder Scrolls Online is actually pretty fun.

428
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I've been playing a little bit of it because it's free.

429
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Well, I mean, not the game, you pay the game.

430
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Guild Wars style.

431
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
But I've had a really good time playing and it's really pretty.

432
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Yeah.

433
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Any, how far have you gotten?

434
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Not terribly far.

435
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I was going to play with Tiara for a bit and I just kind of lapsed out of it.

436
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Which, by the way, there is an update.

437
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Oh, for Elder Scrolls?

438
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
No, for Auroville.

439
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Oh.

440
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
They're still getting two inches of spillage over the dam.

441
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Or over the auxiliary wall.

442
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,000
But it's slowed down and they think they might be able to plug it instead of it breaking.

443
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Oh, thank gosh.

444
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Yeah, so just thought I would do it.

445
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Oh, fingers crossed.

446
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,000
They're draining out of the main spillway and they said that it's going to be below that line pretty soon.

447
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Oh, good, good, good, good, good, good.

448
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
All right, fingers crossed.

449
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
I was sorry to interrupt.

450
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I was going to mention, you know, my prize for winning third place was, they had really stupid prizes.

451
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Yeah.

452
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
I got this book, Dancing with Cats.

453
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
That sounds like the best book ever.

454
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
That's an awesome prize.

455
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Well, yes.

456
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
It was this.

457
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
They had a UFO detector, which I don't know what that was, but it looked like some electronics.

458
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
And then they had a yodeling pickle.

459
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
What?

460
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
It's a pickle that yodels.

461
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
What?

462
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
That sounds awesome, too.

463
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Ragenator in chat is asking over at live.vognetwork.com,

464
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:06,000
speaking of the Elder Scrolls games, Sky, have you seen people installing triple X mods on Skyrim and streaming it on Steam?

465
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
The first part of that question, yes, I see it happening in my house.

466
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I don't need to load it on Steam or Twitch or any of that stuff.

467
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I can just watch my husband do it.

468
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
So I've never gone looking for it on Steam.

469
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:29,000
It gets awkward after you kill some of these old hag witches in there and they have beautiful breasts underneath.

470
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
It's like, okay, that doesn't fit.

471
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
That's just weird.

472
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:41,000
It was explained to me that there is a mod that alters the titty mod so that old ladies have more realistic old lady titties.

473
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
After a while, it was just kind of...

474
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
It just turned dark soccer.

475
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
It was just weird.

476
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
The biggest sigh not on her mic.

477
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I need vodka in this coffee.

478
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I have Stroopwafel in the fridge.

479
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I have a whole bottle at home.

480
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
And Dungeonbuster in chat says you don't need those mods.

481
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,000
You just need Conan Exiles, which we talked about last week.

482
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
That was still the funniest thing.

483
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Okay, when I've been wanting to cheer myself up this week, I've gone back and looked at the animated gifs of them expanding the Wang.

484
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
And it has been the funniest thing because it's so unnatural.

485
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I really, really, really...

486
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:21,000
We need to start a GoFundMe or something to get the money to buy Dark Sakura, Conan Exiles, just so she can stream it.

487
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Just so I can just not see her get past character creation because she won't be able to stop giggling.

488
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
I will do it the whole time.

489
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
I will laugh so much.

490
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I want this...

491
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
It'll be weep, weep, weep, weep.

492
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I would have to break my rule and play a dude just for that.

493
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I'm gonna make him skinny.

494
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Like, skinny.

495
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Okay, you go ahead.

496
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:54,000
I don't know if you remember way back, and I don't know if it was tool controls or analog controls or something like that where they have the breast movement mod or whatever with dead or alive.

497
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Remember where you can actually jiggle the boobs depending on how you move the controls.

498
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:05,000
I remember some game you were playing during OLR in the first years. There was some, like, boob slapping game.

499
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Oh yeah, I remember that too.

500
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Your now wife was obsessed with that game.

501
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Was she? I don't remember.

502
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Of course she was.

503
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
But yeah, I remember that. That was kind of silly.

504
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
And that was like a rhythm game too.

505
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
So yeah, like, you know, it just spins, bounces, and like swings.

506
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Yes, you had to spin the booby or bounce the booby.

507
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,000
What was the name of that game? That should be the classic game of the week. It's got to be ten years old.

508
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Send it to Dark Soccer for consideration.

509
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:41,000
But yeah, so they had that, so now they just need to have that kind of control over the penis in Conan Exiles.

510
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Where, you know, right analog sticks just flopping that shit around.

511
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Fair is fair. Fair is fair.

512
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I think so.

513
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Alright. So yes, so anyhow, before we talked about the booby game I was watching, I played Oblivion.

514
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:58,000
So anyway, the other game I spent an unhealthy amount of time playing this week, ya'll ready for this?

515
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Pokemon Go.

516
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Oh yeah, I was playing that too.

517
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Because the Valentine's event is going on right now with the whole double candy.

518
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Did you find a Porygon anywhere?

519
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Yes.

520
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Where?

521
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Downtown Sacramento.

522
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Girl.

523
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
JN 16th.

524
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I don't have one yet.

525
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Do it before the Valentine's Day event is over.

526
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:25,000
There's late at night after everything shuts down for the state, just pull over to the side of the road or get a wingman to be with you.

527
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
I should have done it while I was downtown last night.

528
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:33,000
That's what I did. One of my Ingress buddies and I, we were like we're gonna go play Ingress and Pokemon Go and then we didn't play any Ingress.

529
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:39,000
We just played Pokemon Go because we went downtown and we started seeing like all the rare spawns like Porygon were coming up.

530
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
And I got Hitmonlee and Hitmonchan.

531
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I was just distracted by all the queens last night.

532
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:50,000
We watched a drag show last night and it was really busy at faces.

533
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:58,000
So yesterday, one of my longest friends I've known for a long time but we haven't hung out a lot in the past couple of years.

534
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,000
It's my old roommate from when this show was in the garage with the Christmas lights. Remember that?

535
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,000
So he is really into Pokemon Go. Which kind of surprised me when I found that out.

536
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,000
I mean I knew he was always like, he's one of those things like, I don't know if he would call himself a gamer.

537
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,000
But like, I remember like old school Final Fantasy games he got obsessed with.

538
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
And now it's Pokemon Go that he's all into, right?

539
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:26,000
So we went to San Francisco and we had planned this trip for a couple of weeks.

540
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
We were just gonna go during the day because I had to host Rocky Horror last night.

541
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:36,000
And so we just went in the morning and we walked down to Pier 39 and it just happened to be double candy weekend, right?

542
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I earned about 450 Magikarp candies in the course of the trip.

543
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Holy crap.

544
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
So I have a Gyarados now. That was easy.

545
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Also for the very first time I finally got a fucking Grimer.

546
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Woo!

547
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Cause that's the one I was like, even if I can just catch a Grimer I can walk and make it a muck and that would excite me.

548
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:04,000
So the cool thing is, thanks to San Francisco Trip, thanks to getting all these new Pokemon in the past few days.

549
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
My Pokedex is now at 151 seen.

550
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Which is, I think, somebody in chat correct me if I'm wrong, but that is the max number you can have in seen without the regional ones.

551
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Without Mr. Mime, without Farfetch'd, cause it's 154 I think is the big number.

552
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
But I'm up to 151 seen.

553
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I don't have 151 caught, I have 142 caught.

554
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,000
So I still have, like I need Kabutops, I need Charizard.

555
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
There's just a bunch that I have to just get more candy to evolve.

556
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Let's go to San Francisco next week.

557
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Again?

558
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Sure, why not.

559
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
There won't be double candy though.

560
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I don't care.

561
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
But it'll still be fun.

562
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
It'll still be fun.

563
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
We'll go do like artsy shit.

564
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
There's an Eevee by the way in your backyard.

565
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Is there?

566
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Yeah.

567
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I don't know if it has a lot of CP.

568
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I need some more Vaporeons.

569
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Why not?

570
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Yeah, it's pretty intense actually.

571
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
SSG100Matt in chat says, I have about 778 Pidgey candies.

572
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
I don't want to talk about it.

573
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Matt, evolve, evolve, evolve.

574
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Evolve every single Pidgey you catch because that's 1000, no 500, whatever.

575
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Every 4 Pidgeys evolves.

576
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
And right now, every 2 Pidgeys evolves.

577
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
So it's like when I see a Pidgey, I get excited because I'm like,

578
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Eevee in your backyard's a bitch.

579
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Free XP.

580
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Maybe I should just play that instead of Ingress.

581
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Honestly?

582
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Well, especially in downtown because I'm guessing that there's a lot of like stuff down there.

583
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I'm between a rock and a hard place with Ingress because I still love the people.

584
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
I love the community.

585
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
I love the events when like people come together and stuff like that.

586
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
And the farms and all that stuff when I get to see people.

587
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
But the game is just, I'm like so over it at this point.

588
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
And the whole thing that they're not doing an anomaly right now.

589
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
They're not doing a live event.

590
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:42,000
They're doing this thing where they have a global event where there's shards around the globe that need to be moved from place to place.

591
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
I'm just like, snore over it.

592
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Like, I don't...

593
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
It's also like, especially with where we're at, you know, it's just overrun.

594
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,000
You know, like there's, I've got, you know, literally I played at the park yesterday when I took my kids there.

595
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
And within like 10 minutes, they're already taking it down.

596
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
I'm like, I'm not even doing anything.

597
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I know, it's just, it's ruining the fun of the game.

598
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I'm just, I'm just kind of over it.

599
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
It made me too angry.

600
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
I gave it up.

601
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
No seriously, I was just getting so mad.

602
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I was like, you know what, I don't care anymore.

603
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Alright.

604
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
By the way, there's also a cubone.

605
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Fine.

606
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Anyhow, let's see.

607
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:22,000
So, looking in comments over in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

608
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
ActDef says, I caught a Porygon with the Go+.

609
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Yeah, here's the thing.

610
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
That Grimer, I caught with the Pogo+.

611
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,000
And I did that thing where I was like, I just felt the vibration on the Pogo+.

612
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,000
And I hit the button and then I realized, oh fuck, that was a yellow vibrate.

613
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
That was a Pokemon I don't have yet.

614
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,000
And my friends that were with me heard me go, fuck, like really loudly.

615
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Which in San Francisco is kind of no big deal.

616
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
But they were like, what happened?

617
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I'm like, whatever that Pokemon is right now, I just threw a Pokeball at it from my Pogo+.

618
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
And it's probably going to run away.

619
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
And they were like, somebody next to me was like, oh, it's a Grimer.

620
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
And I was like, fuck.

621
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
And then the thing vibrated to tell me I caught it.

622
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
And I was like, holy shit.

623
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Because thank God, this is the one case where I'm happy.

624
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
It was only like an 86 CP Grinder or Grinder.

625
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
That's a different phonem.

626
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
86 CP Grimer is what I caught.

627
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
And so I was able to catch it with the Pogo+.

628
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
And it was like one of those like huge sigh of reliefs.

629
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Like, wow, that was close.

630
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
So, anyway.

631
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Oh, SSG100Matt in chat says, Rob, I know that.

632
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:35,000
The problem is that the last time I did a mass Pidgey evolve, they had a double XP weekend.

633
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
I am now paranoid to do another mass evolve again.

634
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Okay.

635
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
All right, I see.

636
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
I see, I understand those concerns.

637
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
All right.

638
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
All right, anyway.

639
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
So that was pretty much it for my gaming week.

640
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
There you go.

641
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Lots of Pokemon Go.

642
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Let's see, other announcements.

643
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
I don't really have anything right now.

644
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
No shows off planned.

645
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,000
There's no expos coming up until April, the IGDA event.

646
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
But that isn't even on a Sunday.

647
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
That's on a Saturday.

648
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
We'll be broadcasting live from that again in some capacity.

649
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I just don't have all the details just yet.

650
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
But that's only a couple months away.

651
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
So in the coming weeks, we'll have more on that.

652
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
I'm sure we'll have at least Gabe, if not Gabe and Bree, and maybe some other people.

653
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Maybe I won't try to get them to bring some developers with them next time.

654
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
And talk about SAC Indie Arcade.

655
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
It'll be fun.

656
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Yeah, I talked to Gabe yesterday.

657
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Or not yesterday, Friday.

658
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
He probably hangs out at Hacker Lab.

659
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Probably ran into him there.

660
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Nope, I asked to interview him.

661
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Oh, okay.

662
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Cool.

663
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
So we got to talk to him.

664
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
He bothered me about not having the game done yet.

665
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,000
And I told him that I was just having trouble being motivated.

666
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
And my God, he brings enough motivation with himself.

667
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
It's like he can't help but feel inspired after talking to him.

668
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Acteft in chat says, Sky, I had to walk almost 150 kilometers to evolve my only Grimer to a muck.

669
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Well, here's the good news, Acteft.

670
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
I got six candies for capturing it, thanks to double candy.

671
00:43:51,000 --> 00:44:00,000
And because it's only half distance you have to walk right now, I've already walked what, I guess, about six kilometers since I caught it because I'm already up to ten candies.

672
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,000
So I'm going to try to get some more walking in probably tomorrow.

673
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
I think the event's over, what, tomorrow or the next day?

674
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
No, it's through Valentine's Day.

675
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
But it's over on the 15th.

676
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:14,000
It's over right after, so I got to make sure I finish that.

677
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,000
I'll try to walk as much as possible to kind of get the jump on some of that candy.

678
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
So maybe I'll only have to walk 100 kilometers, Acteft.

679
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
That's what I'm trying for, anyway.

680
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:29,000
All right, let's get into some other long form news.

681
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Lots of other big stuff happening this week.

682
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
This is a huge one, right, Loki?

683
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Yeah, so they announced that Netflix is going to be getting a Castlevania series.

684
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Right now it's just simply titled Castlevania Season 1 Part 1.

685
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:54,000
And there isn't a whole lot of details other than the producer Adi Shankar said that it's very much Castlevania done in the vein of Game of Thrones.

686
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,000
And they said it's an adaptation of Castlevania 3 Dracula's Curse.

687
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:05,000
And yeah, he says a second season of the show will come in 2018.

688
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,000
I think it's probably pretty easy. That'll be a slam dunk.

689
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
I mean, if they do it just decently, I mean...

690
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Okay, but if it's this year, then it's got to be animated, right? It's not going to be live action, is it?

691
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
I think it could be live action.

692
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
We don't know if it's live action or animated, do we?

693
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
No, we don't know.

694
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
I'm thinking probably live action.

695
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,000
I would think computer-assisted animated would be something that could get done this year.

696
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:34,000
I mean, something like Castlevania, they just announced in February and they're going to have out this year.

697
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Maybe they've been working on it, though.

698
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
That seems aggressive.

699
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
They're just starting on it, I don't know.

700
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Interesting.

701
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:46,000
OrangeRideInChat over at live.vognetwork.com says it was rumored to be animated a long time ago, if I recall correctly.

702
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,000
And that's probably what I'm thinking of in my mind is that, wait a minute, I think back when this was supposed to be an animated thing.

703
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:58,000
So we shouldn't assume it's going to be for sure live action. It could be something animated, right?

704
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Yeah, I mean, we shouldn't assume anything. We don't know yet.

705
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:14,000
But I don't know. You may remember that they did some... Remember, he did that Power Rangers short as well.

706
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
That kind of dark one.

707
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

708
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
I don't know. I'm cut down.

709
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Yeah. I'm curious to see how this turns out. No, I think this could... Netflix produces a lot of quality stuff, obviously.

710
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Things like Orange is the New Black, Stranger Things. These are great shows.

711
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Now, granted, Netflix doesn't create the shows. Netflix distributes the shows.

712
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
But they're only going to distribute things that they have pretty good faith in.

713
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:49,000
I didn't think would be any good in some things that I thought were good. I used to watch them in R&D more.

714
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Like, I watched He-Man. I tried to show my son what He-Man looked like. I'm like, my God, this show is terrible.

715
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Like, I don't know. I like this thing.

716
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
And not everything on...

717
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Buy all our playsets and toys?

718
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:04,000
It's pretty much. Like, in this first episode, I'm like, the animation doesn't match. Like, these people are rendered, like, very realistically.

719
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
And this wizard guy is, like, fucking cartoony. It makes no goddamn sense.

720
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
And then...

721
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Not everything on Netflix is a slam dunk.

722
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:16,000
The kids have been, like, watching Home, which is this, like, DreamWorks movie that's really annoying.

723
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,000
But they watched that, and so I saw that there was a series on there, and I watched the series.

724
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,000
And the series is, like, almost like Adventure Time. Like, the series is fucking hilarious.

725
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:31,000
And I'm like, I was not expecting that of a spin-off animated show from a movie that was a DreamWorks movie.

726
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,000
And I'm like, shit, this is fucking good, actually. Which is kind of funny.

727
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:41,000
So, yeah, I mean, Netflix has a good track record, although they're not all slam dunks.

728
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:46,000
But I feel like, okay, this is good. This could be a very good, like, video game movie.

729
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:53,000
And I'm using that term loosely, because, yes, I know it's a TV show, but the way they're pitching it, what, this part one, season one thing?

730
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:57,000
It sounds more like a mini-series, which is, like, a long movie, right?

731
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Which is fine, because that kind of gives it the space.

732
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:07,000
You know, I think a lot of the complexities with trying to make a video game movie is that a lot of video games take many, many, many hours to beat.

733
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:12,000
And a movie is an hour and a half, two and a half hours tops, unless you're James Cameron.

734
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:21,000
So, I, you know, I think having the space to work with time-wise will be beneficial for a story like Castlevania.

735
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:26,000
And I'm also glad to hear they're going with one of the, you know, they're going with at least a story that fans are going to know.

736
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:35,000
And is one of the more popular games in the franchise, yet still, because it's an 8-bit NES game, before there was voice acting and dialogue and all this stuff,

737
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:39,000
it's going to give them a lot of wiggle room to really have a lot of freedom with it.

738
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Well, also just even the genre, you know, it's supernatural, it's kind of that medieval, you know, thing, people like vampires and that kind of shit.

739
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:54,000
So that'll just be pretty, you know, self-explanatory, so I think they'll do well.

740
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:00,000
And then for season two, they can base it off Symphony of the Night, so the first part is normal,

741
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
and then the second part, they can pull a fucking Stranger Things and do it upside down.

742
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Yeah, I'm, yeah, that's true, they could just do exactly how the games did it, why not? I like that, that's good.

743
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Darzagra, what do you think, hearing about all this, a Castlevania show on Netflix, you guys are a fan of your Castlevania series?

744
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Yeah, and I don't want to think about it, does that make sense? Because I don't want to have an expectation.

745
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Sure, you don't want to run the hype machine too much.

746
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Exactly, because I certainly want to check it out, you know, but at the same time, I know how badly, badly it can go.

747
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Yes, we did see Captain in the series as well.

748
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Captain in was terrible. At the same time, I just really don't want to get my hopes up.

749
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Sure.

750
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
I don't want to get my hopes up, and I don't want to talk myself out of it.

751
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
At least a trailer.

752
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
I'll wait for a trailer.

753
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Wait for a trailer, okay.

754
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,000
But I will reserve my judgment until the event actually occurs.

755
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Okay.

756
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,000
I don't want to have, I can't take another heartbreak.

757
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:16,000
For what it's worth, and I'm sure there's some people going, it's Konami though, Konami kind of ruins everything they touch these days.

758
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
And it's not Konami.

759
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
It's not Konami.

760
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,000
It's basically some dude that wants to license that property.

761
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Konami's going to get a residual check and they'll be very happy.

762
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
We will add this to our Pachi slot profits.

763
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:34,000
If anything, if you want Castlevania to come back for better or worse, I don't know how that's going to work,

764
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,000
considering Igarashi is doing his own thing now with Bloodstained, but for better or for worse,

765
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:43,000
if you want to see Castlevania maybe come back as a game or something, you should hope that this does very well.

766
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Because that's going to light a fire, even if not under Konami.

767
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Under Konami to sell the rights for somebody else to make the game that's capable of doing it.

768
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Pretty much.

769
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:57,000
I don't want, okay, I do not want a click and point game for Castlevania.

770
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
I do not want an adventure game.

771
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
I want a fucking platformer.

772
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Heck, I think the guy who did Axiom Verge, considering that's all like one guy who did all that, ought to be trusted to do a new Metroid game.

773
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Although, I could also understand he is one person who is allowed to do whatever the fuck he wants.

774
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
He's made a stellar game on his own.

775
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Maybe he doesn't want to do someone else's game, and I would respect that completely.

776
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:24,000
But my point is, that guy made an amazing Metroid-inspired game.

777
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:31,000
There is talent out there, even if it's in the indie scene right now, that could create a stellar Castlevania game.

778
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Which will be interesting because at the same time we have Igarashi doing Bloodstained, which we expect and hope will be a stellar Castlevania game.

779
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:49,000
I'm still, my idea of the pinnacle of Castlevania, I want to say Symphony of the Night because it was really pretty, a lot of fun.

780
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:58,000
But the last true Castlevania-style game for the same type of platformer was Dracula X.

781
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:07,000
And I call that the absolute pinnacle of the series. I would love to have that era of Castlevania touched on.

782
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,000
But Castlevania III, not everyone got to deal with Raptor.

783
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Looking in chat over at Live.VogueNetwork.com, ActDeaf says, if Castlevania actually succeeds, will this mean we'll get new video game TV series?

784
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Define success. If Castlevania becomes the next Stranger Things, which I think again is what Jamie is warning you exactly not to do.

785
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Don't put that type of hype machine behind it. But of course, if it does well, there's going to be knock-offs that come out.

786
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Stranger Things was awesome because it came out and people just watched it and they're like, man, this is fucking good. It wasn't like we knew what it was before it came out.

787
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Maybe with the whole supernatural thing, you have Stranger Things to thank for this in some way, maybe.

788
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:55,000
But certainly, if something does well, there's going to be knock-offs that come out, for better or for worse.

789
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:01,000
And maybe it would encourage Konami to try something with Metal Gear or try something with one of their other IPs. We'll see.

790
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:07,000
I know. I know, guys. What would Metal Gear be without Kojima, though? But we'll see.

791
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:15,000
I would definitely go for a Skinemax version of Rumble Roses. It's a long shot.

792
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Let's see. There's some comments on Captain N in chat. RageNator says, Captain N was terrible, but we watched it anyway. Why?

793
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Because there was little to no other gaming programming on TV back then.

794
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Let's see. Bob Coffee in chat talking about Castlevania says, shit, get ArcSys to give it the hardcore uprising treatment.

795
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:45,000
There you go. There's a lot of those, like, retro studios. What's the other one? They do Shantae and DuckTales. WayForward, right?

796
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:52,000
They've done a great job with some of those retro-type. I mean, Shantae was their own thing, but it was still in vain of a retro platformer, basically.

797
00:53:53,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Anyway, there's tons of capable folks out there that could at least, you know, again, don't clone Symphony of the Night. You're never gonna hit that level again.

798
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:11,000
But do a new thing with Castlevania. Take it a new direction. Even the people that did the studios that did the 3DS games, or the DS games, those were even good.

799
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:17,000
When Igarashi was still around then, too, overseeing it. But anyway, we'll see. We'll see.

800
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:23,000
You can't tell me there's not someone that can imitate that style. I mean, come on. Everybody's not completely inept about that.

801
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:39,000
We'll see. We'll see. The other thing I just want to say with the whole Konami tie-in real quick is that, you know, for better or for worse, I kind of still think, not everybody agrees with me, but I kind of think the Silent Hill movie was probably the best video game translation they've done.

802
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,000
It was amazing. It was perfect.

803
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Not everybody agrees. And I'm not talking about the sequel. I'm not talking about the sequel.

804
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
I liked it, though.

805
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
I'm talking about the original.

806
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,000
I've been seeing the sequel, but the original was good. I liked it.

807
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,000
I liked the second one because it was based off Silent Hill 3, which is my favorite Silent Hill.

808
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Interesting, because a lot of people did not like that movie.

809
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Well, a lot of people are wrong.

810
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:03,000
I saw a little bit of it on TV, but I didn't really stick with it.

811
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
I have it. You can come watch it.

812
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,000
I'd rather watch Showgirls again.

813
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Well, we could do both. Kettlecorn.

814
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Because, you know, in Showgirls, she persisted.

815
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:18,000
All right. Let's see.

816
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Why can't we have Telltale take on Showgirls, then?

817
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Like a Showgirls game.

818
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Why not? God damn it. Why not? Let's see.

819
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:31,000
And ActDeaf says, I do agree with you, Sky. Thank you very much. I appreciate that.

820
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Let's see. S2100Matt says, the Earthworm Jim show was pretty good at the time, if I recall.

821
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Oh, yeah. I forgot they have that.

822
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
That's true. That's true.

823
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:47,000
There you go. Some comments from our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

824
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Let's move on to some other stuff going on in gaming news this week, which has to do with Twitch.

825
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,000
You know, Twitch, obviously the very popular live streaming platform.

826
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Twitch now has communities in beta release.

827
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,000
This is something that they've just added is now a community page.

828
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:06,000
And basically what this boils down to is that, you know, when you stream a game on Twitch,

829
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,000
you usually say what game you're going to stream on Twitch,

830
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:15,000
and then you show up in the listings by game, and people can search by game,

831
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:19,000
and people can see what games are popular on Twitch right now and all this other stuff.

832
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Well, now what's happening is that you can create communities,

833
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:28,000
and when you live stream, you can choose one game and one community,

834
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
if I'm understanding all these blog posts and things correct,

835
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
because this is a brand new thing.

836
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,000
You can stream to one game and one community,

837
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,000
and now when you browse for things on Twitch,

838
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:44,000
you not only can browse by game, but you can browse by community.

839
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Well, what's interesting is that a lot of the communities that were first popping up were communities for games.

840
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:57,000
So a lot of the biggest communities you see right now is Heroes of the Storm, Overwatch,

841
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
and it's just all the same stuff as the games.

842
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
But you start to dig a little deeper.

843
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Okay, a little deeper would be, well, now you see Overwatch pro gamers.

844
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:10,000
There's a category for speed running, which obviously is a huge fucking deal

845
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,000
thanks to Awesome Games Done Quick and all the efforts around there.

846
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Dig a little deeper, and then you start to find stuff like LGBT streamers,

847
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:26,000
people that have this common interest, people in a particular geolocation.

848
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
I saw a UK channel earlier today.

849
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:36,000
So now there's discoverability not just by game, but by community.

850
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,000
But it's interesting that you're really limited as a streamer to just pick one community

851
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
to kind of promote your stream under.

852
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
You can switch it, of course, as you switch your stream,

853
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,000
but I just think that's a really neat thing for discoverability,

854
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,000
and discoverability is really where Twitch is kind of killing it right now.

855
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,000
So I think this is a really interesting expansion for them.

856
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
What do you guys think hearing about this?

857
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
I think it's good to build on that stuff.

858
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Yeah.

859
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,000
I mean, because what they had before was kind of basic,

860
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:06,000
so it's nice to be able to have a little bit more other than just the type of game

861
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:10,000
or the title of the game to go off of.

862
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,000
And the creative directory and all this other stuff not going away.

863
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,000
This doesn't impact creative, IRL, or any of that other stuff.

864
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,000
So this is just another kind of directory.

865
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,000
So it doesn't? Because that'd be kind of cool if they had stuff tied in with that as well.

866
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Like, you know, cooking or Bob Ross.

867
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Why not? You can have a community of Bob Ross fans.

868
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Or like, yeah, I don't know.

869
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:39,000
We could have a VoG community even, although, see, here's the thing with that.

870
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:44,000
I actually don't know if that is the particular best use of something like this,

871
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:48,000
because technically we do have a VoG network Twitch.

872
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
We can just set up that VoG network.

873
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
I think we have one, don't we, Bobby?

874
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:57,000
I think we signed up for one and we just have it for those projects we'll get around to someday.

875
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:04,000
I think we have one, and we could technically set up that feed to just auto-host VoG personalities when they stream.

876
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:09,000
So I kind of feel like we don't necessarily need a community.

877
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:13,000
But this is a way to kind of go even maybe a little bigger than that, if that makes sense.

878
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:18,000
So, let's see, Bobby Blackwolf in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

879
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:23,000
you got a VoG Twitch. Oh, I did? I guess I did. I signed up for it and I don't even remember.

880
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:28,000
I hope I remember the password. Bobby Blackwolf says, we were going to use it if we marathoned.

881
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
That's right. I know we were talking about doing that type of stuff.

882
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
And we probably will get around to it someday.

883
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:36,000
But, yeah, so I would think we could just, if we wanted to do something,

884
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,000
that we just set that channel up to auto-host, which I had to do.

885
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:42,000
If I did set it up, I had to just reset the password.

886
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:48,000
And I'm just going to go in there and set it up to auto-host all the people that I know have Twitch

887
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,000
that are affiliated with VoG network.

888
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Because it's not just us and Bobby.

889
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:58,000
I know once in a great while I've seen Captain Spike from Game Buoys streaming.

890
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Shane from Ranger Pride certainly streaming.

891
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
He's been doing a lot of Resident Evil 7 lately.

892
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
So there are other people on the network that do it.

893
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
So we could set something like that up, I'm sure.

894
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Pod Culture has one. Thank you.

895
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:14,000
So that's what we could do for our immediate community.

896
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:19,000
But I'm excited to, and then see what would happen is that I would say that the VoG network channel

897
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:29,000
should join a podcasting community or podcasters community or radio community

898
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,000
or something that speaks more like what VoG network is a part of, join that community.

899
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
If that makes sense. Anyway.

900
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
I'm excited to see how this plays out.

901
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,000
A quick update though. I want to mention in the live streaming space,

902
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:45,000
there's YouTube Gaming has obviously been trying to come for a piece of Twitch.

903
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,000
But then we have Beam as kind of more of an up and comer.

904
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:52,000
But a lot of folks paying attention to them as opposed to Hitbox and some of the others

905
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
because Beam was purchased by Microsoft.

906
01:00:54,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Well, the Beam streaming just hit Microsoft's alpha program for the people that are in the alpha.

907
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:05,000
You know how they have those different stages of dashboards on the Xbox One?

908
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:12,000
So people in the most inner circle of Microsoft hell in their preview program can now stream to Beam.

909
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:16,000
It looks pretty bare bones from what I was looking at, but I'm not in the alpha program,

910
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,000
so I can't play with it firsthand.

911
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:22,000
But that is, you know, once Beam is native in Xbox One, that's going to be interesting to see

912
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,000
how that's going to grow that network.

913
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Because, you know, Beam has all the interactive stuff going on with it too.

914
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:32,000
There's a lot of stuff I do like about Beam and even I'm having a hard time going,

915
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Oh, do I want to stream on Twitch where all the people are at?

916
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Or do I want to stream in Beam because I like this message of the interactivity

917
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,000
and maybe Beam is going to be like the next big wave and you want to be a part of that?

918
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Or do I just go to YouTube?

919
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Probably not because there's a lot YouTube does that I'm not a fan of.

920
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,000
So...

921
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Anyway.

922
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
All right.

923
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
And they don't have a way to do it to both.

924
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:59,000
That'd be cool, like a website that would just spit it out to all the different sites.

925
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, is Xtopher still streaming Rayman?

926
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,000
He does stream games.

927
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:08,000
I don't think he does Rayman anymore, but I have seen him do random stuff on Xbox One.

928
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,000
So there's that.

929
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Let's see.

930
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Tigerclaw says, Twitch does have a podcast directory so you could do a live podcast on Twitch.

931
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Believe me, I've given that a lot of thought.

932
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,000
A lot.

933
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,000
It's just going to cost money in upgrades here in the studio.

934
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
But it's on my mind for sure.

935
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Anyway.

936
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,000
And Tigerclaw says, you should follow Twitch slash vog network.

937
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Twitch TV slash vog network just in case they do something.

938
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Yes.

939
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Yes.

940
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Just in case.

941
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
That would be a good thing to go follow.

942
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
And then I'm not above giving my own personal channel a cheap plug.

943
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Rob Roberts.

944
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Over on Twitch.

945
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,000
I don't remember what my channel is.

946
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,000
I think you're Loki O-L-R.

947
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,000
You're either Loki O-L-R or O-L-R Loki.

948
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
I could just go look at my auto host because you're on it.

949
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,000
So she...

950
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,000
I think mine's O-L-R Dark Sakura.

951
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Yeah, okay.

952
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Or with an underscore.

953
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Yeah, that's maybe why I'm confused.

954
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
I remember mine.

955
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:58,000
I had trouble moving it from Justin TV.

956
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
It was like being stupid.

957
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Yeah, yeah.

958
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Not wanting to come up.

959
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Boy.

960
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Some of us got bit being an early adopter on Justin TV, huh?

961
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,000
With that whole like, you can't bring your names over or whatever.

962
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,000
But anyway.

963
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
That's all in the past now.

964
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Let's move on.

965
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,000
More news to talk about.

966
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,000
More big news, right Dark Sakura?

967
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
This is another big deal from this week.

968
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Yeah, green light's going away.

969
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Steam green light.

970
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Yep.

971
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Wow.

972
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Bye.

973
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Poor little green light.

974
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
This little light of mine will not shine.

975
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,000
So yeah.

976
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Basically, to just recap what steam green light was.

977
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Is that it would allow customers to vote on different projects.

978
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:46,000
And they are doing away with it in favor of a different more streamlined system that is called Steam Direct.

979
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:50,000
So green light, the point of it was just to gauge interest.

980
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:54,000
But now this newer system is going to be...

981
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:59,000
It's not necessarily as much of a popularity contest like green light was.

982
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:05,000
As well, developers will be able to fill out a form and submit their game to a compatibility test.

983
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Pay a fee and launch the game.

984
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:13,000
So right now, for green light, they pay $100.

985
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,000
And they'll have to pay more, quite likely.

986
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:21,000
The thought is that it can go anywhere up to $5,000.

987
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,000
But they're looking to find a balance.

988
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:31,000
So they want to discourage questionable quality games.

989
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Just anyone putting whatever they want to.

990
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:42,000
And actually making sure that the games that are promoted are well executed, well thought out, good games.

991
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:48,000
This is a tricky thing because I tend to agree with what's in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

992
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:53,000
JD says internet voting is always super right for manipulation, so that's probably a good thing.

993
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,000
And I think there is a lot of garbage and noise on Steam green light.

994
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:03,000
But then I think of people like YYR who got his multitasking thing through on green light.

995
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:08,000
And I'm like, I just, as a fan of his games, I'm excited for him and what that's going to bring and all that.

996
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:13,000
So it's like, it really sucks that a few bad apples kind of fucked it for everybody else, you know what I mean?

997
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Well, it's not just that too, but they're also getting a generally lower population of voters now.

998
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Because there's so much out there.

999
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Not just that.

1000
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
There's not a lot of incentive to vote.

1001
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:28,000
I mean, in numbers, people are losing interest in that type of a thing.

1002
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:36,000
But they said this doesn't affect anybody who's using Steam early access where developers can sell incomplete builds of the game.

1003
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:43,000
But just in general, that it hasn't remained a viable system, so they are looking to transition into something a little bit better.

1004
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:50,000
I still think this is a fucking terrible plan, to be honest, because it's not addressing the problem that they've had from day one with green light.

1005
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:58,000
I don't think the voter manipulation thing is such a big deal because, you know, still some games don't get through that process.

1006
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:02,000
And I feel that some of those that don't get through are just shit.

1007
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:09,000
There are a lot that do get through their shit, or some that do get through that look good, but then they're shit and then they don't run.

1008
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Because there's not a fucking QA process with the whole thing.

1009
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:16,000
You're paying a fee to put your game on the service, and then you don't do any checking.

1010
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:23,000
And now, all they're doing instead, you're not even going to have the people voting on whether they want the game in or not.

1011
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
It's just, you pay your fee and it's released.

1012
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:29,000
That's even worse! That's worse than having people vote on your game.

1013
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:34,000
And now, on top of all that, I mean, I guess, general compatibility, what the fuck does that mean?

1014
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:39,000
And now, if I want to release something, I could possibly pay up to $5,000 to do that.

1015
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:43,000
I'm not releasing on Steam, if that's the case, because I don't have $5,000.

1016
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:51,000
And thank you for blocking me from being able to release on Steam, because dipshit's fucking released garbage and you never had a QA team look at that shit.

1017
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:55,000
And you still don't fucking have a QA team look at that shit. It's gonna get worse.

1018
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:59,000
All you're doing is blocking people that don't have money to release on your platform.

1019
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:03,000
That doesn't mean that they're bad developers. It just means they don't have money.

1020
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:07,000
They're trying to make money by putting shit on Steam, and you're fucking blocking that shit.

1021
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Thank you, Val, for being fucking stupid as usual.

1022
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:15,000
So, you have quite the tone. You have a very pointed tone about this.

1023
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
It's fucking ridiculous! Everybody said they need a QA process.

1024
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:22,000
They need a team of people to look at this shit to make sure that it functions.

1025
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:26,000
That it actually is a game that's playable, that's not garbage.

1026
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:32,000
But they're not doing that. Why am I paying like $1,000, $5,000 to the service?

1027
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:36,000
What are you giving me for that? It's per game.

1028
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Greenlight used to be you pay $100 and then you release as many games as you want.

1029
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:50,000
And I think that's the problem, because $100 for a bunch of games, that's good for if someone doesn't have a lot of money, but then there's a lot of garbage on there.

1030
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:56,000
So how about this? How about you strike a compromise? Keep the Greenlight system, raise the fee for $100 per game instead.

1031
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Then you're not going to get all this garbage on there.

1032
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Bobby Black Wolf wants to point out, you do realize you get the money back if it sells, right?

1033
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:09,000
So that $5,000 comes back to you in the sales before Valve takes their cut, basically.

1034
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:15,000
But even with that being said, I mean, $5,000 is a lot of money. That's still a very high bar.

1035
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:23,000
If it was $500, maybe, I mean, that's, you know, it's still nothing to sneeze at, but it's still relatively reasonable.

1036
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Even if you couldn't come up with the $500 yourself, you could probably crowdfund it with minimal ease if your game is worthy.

1037
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
But it's still ridiculous so that someone would have to go through it.

1038
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:37,000
And I bet you anything, the quality of games is not going to fucking differ on there, especially if you're getting...

1039
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:41,000
And so what if you get that money back? Who cares if you get the money back?

1040
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Then what's the point if I'm paying that to you? How about you just charge less money and actually use it for something, like a QA team?

1041
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Ragenator in chat says, Loki OLR is right. There needs to be QA. Digital homicide is prime example of why QA is needed.

1042
01:08:55,000 --> 01:09:00,000
They're just part of it, I mean, but there's a lot of shit out there, not even digital homicide crap.

1043
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:06,000
They're just crazy people. And that's just, they're just simply unplayable games.

1044
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Like, just shitty games that are on there that they just don't function at all.

1045
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:18,000
And you just, there needs to be someone checking this, or at the very least, you know, have the community say,

1046
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Hey, notifying Steam, report this game because it's not fucking playable, and then they can look into it.

1047
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:28,000
SSG100Matt says, How does Apple handle their app space for mobile stuff?

1048
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Well, yeah, I mean, Apple obviously does some sense of QA policing on their games, well, and apps,

1049
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:42,000
because, you know, there's a process to get listed on the store, but at the same time, there's a lot of noise on that store.

1050
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:47,000
You know what I mean? There's a lot of, like, garbage apps on, like, games and people trying to make a quick buck.

1051
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,000
That's what ratings are for.

1052
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Like the whole, when Fire Emblem Heroes came out, a bunch of these games that are just garbage games

1053
01:09:55,000 --> 01:10:03,000
renamed themselves to Fire Emblem Heroes tic-tac-toe, Fire Emblem Heroes, just to kind of get found in the searches and things like that.

1054
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:07,000
You know what I mean? Like, it's just, there's a lot of, like, poopy caca things out there.

1055
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:15,000
But at least, at least, now to be fair, at least, I think what Apple, you can't really QA if a game is good.

1056
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:22,000
That's too subjective. But at least what Apple is doing is making sure this isn't gonna cause your phone to explode.

1057
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Like, what happened to their mouse?

1058
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Well, Blackwall's saying he had a $5,000 amount. That was in the actual article.

1059
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:31,000
They were saying they were considering pricing between $100 to $5,000.

1060
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Granted, $5,000 I think is gonna be a stretch, but even if it was $1,000, that's still fucking ridiculous.

1061
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:40,000
I mean, considering that, then fine. You know what's gonna happen because of that?

1062
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,000
If you fucking do that shit, we'll go to other platforms.

1063
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:49,000
You know, release a Humble Bundle or Humble Store that, you know, it's not a Steam version of the game or something like that.

1064
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:53,000
I don't know if it needs to be on Steam to be released on Humble, but there's other places, but...

1065
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Several people in chat yelling out itch.io.

1066
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Dungeonbuster pointing out itch.io.

1067
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Parodied Steam's move with their itch.io direct page that requires no applications or approval necessary.

1068
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:12,000
And I have heard, you know, if you haven't poked around on itch.io, I haven't, and I admittedly have used it very, very limited.

1069
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:17,000
So, I do need to go around and poke on there a little more because I hear there's a lot of good, like, even free...

1070
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Like, just like the shit that would have been in the demo scenes in the Commodore 64 days.

1071
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:25,000
You have that type of stuff that exists on itch.io, so there's a lot to find there.

1072
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:31,000
I'm just worried that, like, this kind of stuff is going to stop people from releasing their stuff.

1073
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
How are you going to make money if, you know...

1074
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Like, even locally, we've got indie guys, you know, that are literally two-man teams going to release a game.

1075
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Where are they going to get the funding to put this out there?

1076
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:53,000
And even still, like, with Steam Greenlight, that's also a way to generate hype for something because you have it being viewed by a lot of people seeing that this is coming out.

1077
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:57,000
And they're able to kind of promote it and stuff like that.

1078
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Now that's not even going to be a thing anymore.

1079
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:08,000
I just... This is not... Raising the bar of entry level is not going to solve the problem.

1080
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:17,000
Because you have a quality issue, and if you're not checking the quality, then it's going to be the same problem still.

1081
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:21,000
To be fair, let me ask this last question here.

1082
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Could it be that what they're trying to do is, since they just don't have the money...

1083
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Which I kind of don't believe, but at the same time, they say they don't have the money or the capacity to hire the people to do QA checks or what have you, to look for these kinds of quality things.

1084
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Could it be that the fact that the money you're paying up front, which you do recoup if you sell enough copies of the game, the fact that the game should be able to sell...

1085
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:51,000
What, if you're selling a $10 game, what, 500 copies to get $5,000 back, if it's that high? We'll just make that up.

1086
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:57,000
That is the quality check. Is your game worthy of selling 500 copies? That's the quality check.

1087
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:04,000
I don't think that's it at all, because if you make it a really obscure game that's of good quality, but just doesn't sell.

1088
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:09,000
I mean, I don't think that necessarily... That doesn't dictate the functionality of the game.

1089
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:14,000
You could have a game that looks really good, but just is fucking broken.

1090
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:22,000
And if people buy it, I mean, how's that going to work with refunds and stuff? I think the whole idea is stupid.

1091
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:31,000
But hey, if they really don't want to go the route of QA, then they're just not going to have quality... They're going to have a quality issue on Steam, which is what they have already.

1092
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Yeah, and maybe even selling 500 copies of a game can probably be a bit of a challenge.

1093
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Because I want to say, you remember the guy that we had on our show a couple months ago, and he did the Cap President game? Remember that?

1094
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Well, we've been following each other on Twitter a little bit, and he was posting about some of this stuff.

1095
01:13:52,000 --> 01:14:00,000
And I want to say, he said that his latest game had only sold so many copies that he wouldn't have recouped a $5,000 cost.

1096
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Yeah, I mean, what if you make a small game that's like you're charging 99 cents on there? Doesn't mean it's a bad game, it's just a short game or an artsy game or something like that.

1097
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:20,000
And then... you're fucked. Or what if you want to release a free-to-play game? Then what? I mean, it's just... it's not good.

1098
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:25,000
I just don't think this is the way that they need to go about it. I think that a QA process would be good.

1099
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:39,000
And granted, I'm not expecting them to be able to QA test to death this stuff, but if you're charging like $100 per game, and let's just say that that doesn't get recouped, that's just a part of doing business on Steam, which I'm fine with.

1100
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Have that $100 go to pay somebody to look at the game for a few hours. That, I think, will give you a good idea.

1101
01:14:48,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Alright. Well, I'm sure this will only develop in the coming weeks, as there are plenty in the community like Loki who have very strong opinions on this that Valve is going to have to listen to for better or for worse.

1102
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:07,000
So we'll see what happens in the coming weeks. In the meantime, though, we do need to move on with some other news. Loki, you have the next story.

1103
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Yep. So let's talk a little bit about Valve some more, and what they actually are doing since they're not putting out a QA team.

1104
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:29,000
They are going to be developing VR games. There are some more full VR games, and these are unlike the stuff that they released before, because remember they did like The Lab, which was, I think, that whole Portal 2 thing.

1105
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:55,000
But yeah, so basically you're saying they have the ability to think about input and devices and design systems should be like, and when he's trying to design games, their sense is going to be to allow to build such more better entertainment experiences for people, because now they develop the VR hardware, so let's make some good VR games that go along with that.

1106
01:15:55,000 --> 01:16:08,000
I just want them to release something. That's really it. Just release a game. Portal 3 preferably, but anything with a 3 in it would be great. Anything would be good.

1107
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Even an on 3 would be fine. But you do know that they have been doing these little games for the HTC Vive.

1108
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:25,000
Ironically, the number of games that are in development right now in Valve? 3. They have 3 games in development. 3. Half-Life 3 confirmed.

1109
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Alright.

1110
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:37,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Laundry Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase CLUB.

1111
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Moving on, let's talk about a different company. I don't want to talk about Valve now. Let's talk about Square Enix. Why not? Let's talk about Final Fantasy for a little bit. Or in this case, we'll talk about Dissida. I don't know if I ever say the same name. Dissidia. Is that what it is? Dissidia.

1112
01:16:51,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Final Fantasy Dissidia is the fighting game spin-off, of course, and so it's kind of big in the arcades, and I think...

1113
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Is it out in the arcades yet? Because I remember seeing the trailers for it, but I didn't know that was...

1114
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:11,000
I thought they had two versions of it out, actually. There was an original one, and now there's a second version that's out.

1115
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:28,000
But anyway, director Takeo Kujiroaka in Weekly Famitsu Magazine had mentioned that if we can export it to the world as a high proficiency competitive fighting tool, while also an enjoyable team battle Final Fantasy, it might even rise up as an esports event.

1116
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:37,000
If that happens, the next would be a global tournament, right? I can't say too much, but I want to use these sorts of ambitions to make Dissidia Final Fantasy an even better game.

1117
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:54,000
So, could Square Enix be looking at doing something kind of like what you see with Capcom Pro and all this stuff, Overwatch League and all this, but something that's a little more around this Final Fantasy Dissidia game?

1118
01:17:55,000 --> 01:18:08,000
I think Final Fantasy has the built-in fanbase for something like that. I think it would attract probably new people that may not always necessarily get into fighting games, just based on the strength of the Final Fantasy characters.

1119
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:20,000
I think there's a lot of interest in this game. I think where it's not doing so well is that we are sitting here going, we're not sure where you can get this game right now, or how many versions of it actually exist.

1120
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Or if it's even out.

1121
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:29,000
That should be pretty fucking clear if we want this to be an esports game and something that's going to be catching on a little bit.

1122
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:36,000
So, don't make it something that you can only get in Japan only either or anything like that.

1123
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:47,000
But anyway, let's move on to some other gaming news. Just a few more stories and then we'll get to this week's classic system of the month.

1124
01:18:47,000 --> 01:19:01,000
In New York, the Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman basically claimed that Time Warner Cable defrauded its customers by providing slower than advertised internet service.

1125
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:16,000
And this actually came about because of thousands of League of Legends players, especially ones who were not just playing it but were also watching the streams.

1126
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:34,000
There is an 87 page complaint that was released on the first of this month that said that it was also further complicated by the fact that Time Warner Cable merged with Charter and basically increased their profitability while lowering their overall speeds.

1127
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:45,000
Also in this claim is that they also worked to confuse the FCC, the Federal Communications Commission.

1128
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:54,000
So, this is all going to be going forward. The claims start from January 2012 up until now.

1129
01:19:54,000 --> 01:20:04,000
And that they also added that when it was Spectrum that they leased modems and wireless routers that were incapable of providing the advertised speed.

1130
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:12,000
I can tell you what I know of our local provider that they also do that here. You get much better speed if you buy your own.

1131
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:26,000
They were noting that when they connected wirelessly, subscribers on a 300 Mbps plan were only getting 15% of the promised speed and so on.

1132
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:32,000
So, yeah. This, I mean, honestly enough, I think this could set a great precedent.

1133
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Yeah, I agree. Cable companies are doing shady, shady fucking things as cable is starting to become more irrelevant in the age of the internet.

1134
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:47,000
And now your cable providers are basically your internet providers and they want to make their money wherever they can.

1135
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:52,000
And this is where we get things like data caps and all this other stuff.

1136
01:20:52,000 --> 01:21:03,000
The only thing that led to an improvement in performance was, in this case, Netflix and Riot Games paying the provider to improve access to their customers.

1137
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Oh, hell no. Oh, hell no.

1138
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
So, yeah. It's basically...

1139
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:10,000
This is why net neutrality is important.

1140
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:16,000
They said that it took the open internet order to solve those issues.

1141
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:25,000
You know, so it's shady, shady shit. It is shady as hell. And while they can get away with it, they're going to do it.

1142
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
This is why we regulate business.

1143
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Yeah. And I just, you know, again, I don't want to get too political.

1144
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:41,000
But the rumor is the person that they're bringing in that's going to be overseeing the FCC question mark.

1145
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Sorry, I don't have the source right in front of me. Maybe somebody in chat will correct me.

1146
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,000
But is kind of anti net neutrality.

1147
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:54,000
And we'll see. Actions speak louder than words, so I'm not going to jump to judgment.

1148
01:21:54,000 --> 01:22:00,000
But if that is true that this individual is anti net neutrality, that sucks.

1149
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:04,000
And this is why. Like, this is why I'm telling you this is bad.

1150
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Because now you're going to have, like, even this radio show could possibly be something that is not going to come through full speed on your internet or possibly even at all.

1151
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Because I'm telling you, if your cable company wants us to pay money to open up the port so you can do shoutcast or whatever, fuck them in their ears.

1152
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:30,000
That's not happening. But this is why net neutrality is important.

1153
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Well, in conclusion, they want, I guess in this case, Spectrum, because that's how it went under, to produce an accounting and disgorge all money.

1154
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:44,000
This is a quote. Moneys resulting from the fraudulent and illegal practices alleged.

1155
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:54,000
They're also asking for a series of civil penalties ranging from two thousand dollars to five thousand for each violation of New York law.

1156
01:22:54,000 --> 01:23:03,000
So. And of course, Time Warner Cable is like, we're sad that they did this after our merger. Me.

1157
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:06,000
We do good stuff. Me.

1158
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:09,000
But but but is it true, though? Is it true, though?

1159
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Me. Allegedly.

1160
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:15,000
All right. Moving on. Loki.

1161
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:18,000
OK, so.

1162
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Let's talk a little bit about delays, and unfortunately, I kind of figured this may have been something that's going to be delayed since we haven't heard too much about it lately.

1163
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:38,000
But yeah, during, I guess, the latest Ubisoft earnings call, the South Park Fractured But Whole has been delayed yet again.

1164
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:47,000
And now it's going to come out in the next fiscal year, which relies anywhere between April 1st of this year to March 31st of next year.

1165
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
So no idea when that's coming out.

1166
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Well, that sucks. That was when I was looking forward to.

1167
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Yeah, me as well.

1168
01:23:54,000 --> 01:24:00,000
But here we go again with the whole bad game is bad forever and if it needs more time in the oven to be good.

1169
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:05,000
That's true. South Park was fantastic. You know, the Stick of Truth was a great game, so I'm willing to give them time.

1170
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:13,000
So it's like it's one of those things where, like, I don't know how else to express this. I'm upset, but I'm not upset.

1171
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:20,000
I'm not upset if they have to take the time to make it just right, but I'm upset in the moment that I was hoping to play it this month and I won't be.

1172
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:26,000
But then again, if it was supposed to be coming out around February or March, then you got Mass Effect coming out.

1173
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:33,000
Exactly. Mass Effect Andromeda, we have Zelda, so okay, you know, I'll deal. I'll deal.

1174
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:38,000
And at least what? The pre-orders are still getting the Stick of Truth on PS4 and all that, right?

1175
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:43,000
Yeah, in fact, ironically enough, they refunded my pre-order for that, but I still got Stick of Truth.

1176
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Really?

1177
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:53,000
Yeah, they did something, I think, either when it got delayed or something happened where they refunded the amount that you paid for that, but I still keep the free game.

1178
01:24:53,000 --> 01:25:03,000
Come on, Noel Gus in chat says April 1st would be a perfect release date. Why not? Although, that seems like a little soon.

1179
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:09,000
And now I feel like this is probably going to be summer. Like, if they've gone to this length to delay the game, they didn't delay it 45 days.

1180
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:15,000
Yeah, they're not going to make it miss the fiscal year just because they want to do a joke release date.

1181
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:21,000
This is now summer or even potentially fall. Summer seems likely.

1182
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Probably.

1183
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:26,000
But I guess we don't know. So, alright.

1184
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:32,000
And come on, Noel Gus in chat says I hope Mass Effect butt play makes up for it.

1185
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:37,000
Me too. Do you see there's already fan communities around some of the alien characters?

1186
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Are they going to fracture that butt hole?

1187
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Yes!

1188
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Yes, you can always fracture butt holes in Mass Effect, that's true.

1189
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:50,000
Well, I mean, I only run like one of the now biggest Mass Effect tumblers.

1190
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:55,000
Oh, oh, well, oh, excuse, excuse, I am in the presence of royalty, excuse me.

1191
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:59,000
I'm almost about to hit the 10,000 person threshold.

1192
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:00,000
Congrats.

1193
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,000
I'm Mass Effect-ing.

1194
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:02,000
Congrats.

1195
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:10,000
Well, anyway, the fandom is wanking. The wank is happening. There is just all kinds of wankage.

1196
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Wank!

1197
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:19,000
Alright, let's move on. One more story for you guys and we'll get to our classic system of the week.

1198
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:24,000
And this has to do with, hey, something a lot of you are looking forward to on the Switch, Splatoon 2.

1199
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:28,000
And many folks, you know, are going to be excited to play this this summer.

1200
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:33,000
But guess what? Maybe you'll get to play it a little sooner. How about March 24th?

1201
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Yeah, no, the game isn't releasing on March 24th, but they are going to be doing a global test fire for the game.

1202
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
You may remember that they did this with the original Splatoon.

1203
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:51,000
And you could play Splatoon, the multiplayer modes, online to kind of like stress test the servers, basically, for free for a very limited amount of time.

1204
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:58,000
So the bad news is it's not like all weekend long or anything. It is still some very limited windows.

1205
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:05,000
But on March 24th, you'll be able to play from noon to 12.59 Pacific and from 8 to 8.59 Pacific.

1206
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:12,000
And then on March 25th, you can play from 4 to 5 a.m. Pacific, which obviously they're doing that for other time zones.

1207
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:17,000
12 to 1 Pacific, 8 to 9, a minute before 9, come on.

1208
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:22,000
8 to 9 Pacific is on the 25th, and then on March 26th, you can play from 4 to 5 a.m. Pacific.

1209
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:27,000
So, yeah, they'll be doing this Splatoon test fire. It's still going to be limited in scope.

1210
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:34,000
You're only going to get to use four weapons, and there's going to be like remixed versions of the Splat Roller and Splat Charger.

1211
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:40,000
That will all be available on the eShop, so something else to look forward to on the Switch in March, if nothing else.

1212
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:47,000
I mean, yes, it's very limited in scope, but at least you know you get to spend a good hour or two with Splatoon 2 in March before June.

1213
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:50,000
I feel like you're going to say something real bitchy here, Logie.

1214
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:54,000
You would be correct. It's limited in scope, kind of like the launch lineup for the Switch.

1215
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:07,000
Anyway, let's get to the classic system of the week, of the month.

1216
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
Thanks for the spoilers, Rob.

1217
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:14,000
How am I supposed to promote this? You fucking changed everything this year.

1218
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,000
That's right.

1219
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,000
I don't know what to do anymore.

1220
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:19,000
I'm a lady. I can change my mind.

1221
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:29,000
Anyhow, every week Dark Soccer steps into the gaming vault and then finds a game that she thinks, hey, you ungrateful brats, you should be checking out this game.

1222
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:32,000
Screw your buttholes in Mass Effect itself.

1223
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
These are kind of the list of systems I wish I had.

1224
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:43,000
But once a month, Dark Soccer likes to surprise us by saying, you know what, I'm going to give you a whole system to play with this month.

1225
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:48,000
It's the classic system of the month, Dark Soccer. What did you pick for the month of February 2017?

1226
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:52,000
I picked the PC-FX. Ever hear of it?

1227
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,000
No.

1228
01:28:53,000 --> 01:29:00,000
The PC-FX was made by NEC, so it is in the family of the PC Engine.

1229
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:05,000
I actually have heard of this. I just said no to let you chat.

1230
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:12,000
It was released on January 23, 1994, right after the PlayStation and a month after the Sega Saturn.

1231
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:15,000
And it is, of course, the successor to the PC Engine.

1232
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:20,000
So for us, the PC Engine was the TurboGrafx-16.

1233
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:30,000
It was only released in Japan. It looks like a PC tower, and it was meant to be upgradeable.

1234
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:37,000
But the graphics system in it was pretty outdated by the time it came out and pretty underpowered.

1235
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:41,000
So it actually was a commercial failure.

1236
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:48,000
So they say it's still got its pretty big fan base like any system can have.

1237
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:54,000
It also had a general lack of developer support, so it had fewer games.

1238
01:29:54,000 --> 01:30:02,000
And basically, it was NEC's last gaming console and was discontinued in February 1998.

1239
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:12,000
Basically, it was meant to be, like I was saying, the competitor with Saturn and the PlayStation.

1240
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:18,000
And they built it under this 32-bit architecture called Iron Man.

1241
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:28,000
And they demonstrated Iron Man at a few trade shows in 1992.

1242
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:35,000
And we're starting to discuss the release of an Iron Man-based video game system with their developers.

1243
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:39,000
And the PC Engine was still super, super popular at the time.

1244
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:42,000
So people were like, hey, we're pretty happy about this.

1245
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:51,000
But there were plenty also, though, who were uninterested from switching to the more powerful hardware while the PC Engine was still alive and well.

1246
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:54,000
PC Engine was still kicking ass.

1247
01:30:54,000 --> 01:31:04,000
So they put the project on hold and put more work into it so that they could release it when all the other ones were there.

1248
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:15,000
So by the time they released the PC-FX, it still was relatively unchanged from what they had displayed in 1992.

1249
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:20,000
The only big difference is that they added a 32-bit RISC CPU.

1250
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:31,000
It actually, as a console, Famicon Tsushin gave it an 18 out of 40.

1251
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:34,000
So not very good review.

1252
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:37,000
And also, it didn't have a polygon graphic processor.

1253
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
So it really...

1254
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
I just, ew.

1255
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,000
Yeah.

1256
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
Probably held it back a little bit.

1257
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:49,000
And their reasoning for this was that they were relatively low-powered and it would make everything look blocky.

1258
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Which, I mean, yeah, that's pretty much what 3D graphics were at the time, right?

1259
01:31:54,000 --> 01:32:01,000
But the target audience was supposed to be basically the ones who had grown up with the PC Engine.

1260
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:06,000
So they were looking for basically five years older than the standard PC Engine user at the time.

1261
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:11,000
And, of course, NEC and Hudson Soft had been in bed for, like, ever.

1262
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:14,000
So they were really relying on Hudson to do a lot of games.

1263
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:21,000
But really, the biggest things that came out were just different anime franchises.

1264
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:26,000
So that's why if you look at the list of the games, it's all like...

1265
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
Like, there's like two Zenki games.

1266
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:32,000
There's a Cutie Honey game, which I think I linked to the Cutie Honey music in the background.

1267
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:41,000
Just basically all of that era of 90s anime out at the time ended up somehow or another making it into a game.

1268
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:49,000
It also... a lot of the... with the PC-FX, they also did have computer versions of it.

1269
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Like the NEC PC-98.

1270
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:57,000
So it was a built... you could get it as a built-in card for your PC.

1271
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
Some pretty interesting stuff.

1272
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:05,000
I mean, it's... yeah, the hardware's just really not exciting for its day.

1273
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:10,000
And the total games released were 62.

1274
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
Only 62 games that came out for this system.

1275
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:17,000
I think the only thing that's done worse was, like, what, the Engager?

1276
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:20,000
No, because there was the Super Graphics.

1277
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:24,000
And I think there were only eight games for the Super... six or eight games for the Super Graphics.

1278
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
How many games for the Pippin?

1279
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:28,000
Girl.

1280
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:32,000
But anyway, though, it really is, though, a unique system.

1281
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:39,000
And for... you know, I'll admit this, I went and got plenty of Saturn games, you know, based off of anime I was into at the time.

1282
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:47,000
Like, I've got the Utena game and Blue Seed and... just a handful of them.

1283
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:54,000
But at the same time, you know, there is one thing, though, that I do super like about this is that...

1284
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:57,000
I'm trying to go back and find the picture so I can describe it.

1285
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:00,000
I like the controller on it because the controller is...

1286
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:09,000
It looks like it's a slightly more comfortable version, I think, of the six button turbo pad that we got for the Turbo Graphics.

1287
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:19,000
Let me go through some of the games on here just to, you know, list for people the general thing.

1288
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:23,000
I mean, you had... you know, for anime stuff, you had Amigami-sama.

1289
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:28,000
You had... there was actually a series of anime freak games.

1290
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:34,000
There was... let's see if you... there was Cutie Honey.

1291
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:40,000
There was Zenki, Galaxy Fallen Yuna.

1292
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:45,000
There was Little Red Riding Hood Cha-Cha there.

1293
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:49,000
But for me, for some other games on here, though, we had...

1294
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:56,000
There was... All Japan Women's Pro Wrestling Queen of Queens was another one on there.

1295
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:01,000
There were a few, but mostly, though, from what I noticed, like, just a lot of, you know, interesting platformer games.

1296
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:06,000
Yeah, there was even a Tenchi game, just looking over the list.

1297
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
Voice Paradise. Yeah.

1298
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:12,000
So, yeah, not too many impressive things. Oh, and a Mahjong game.

1299
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:16,000
So, not too many really impressive things on there.

1300
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:23,000
But it's worth noting that it was NEC's last foray into console development.

1301
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:27,000
So... and there you have it. The PC-FX.

1302
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:30,000
Your classic console of the month. The PC-FX.

1303
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:31,000
Yerp.

1304
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
Alright, go buy one today. Just kidding.

1305
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
Go buy me one today.

1306
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:42,000
I just really want it more for the novelty, although if I was looking at that in a Duo RX, I'd get a Duo RX any day.

1307
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:46,000
Alright, we are going to take a quick break, but don't go anywhere.

1308
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:51,000
We have plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come, including your calls and all that over on Skype.

1309
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:54,000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

1310
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:58,000
We also have some more news, including a new hack for the NES Classic. That'll be a good time.

1311
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:02,000
And, of course, Dark Soccer wants to talk about Mass Effect Andromeda.

1312
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
It probably involves butts.

1313
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,000
It might not.

1314
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,000
Alien butts.

1315
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:12,000
Alright, we'll be back after this quick break with more of Orange Lounge Radio. Stay tuned.

1316
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:26,000
Hi, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 675, already in progress for this February the 12th of 2017.

1317
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:29,000
Happy Valentine's Day, I suppose.

1318
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:32,000
Or Single Awareness Day, whatever the case may be.

1319
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:38,000
You know what, just whatever your relationship status is, just go eat some chocolate.

1320
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:42,000
Or don't. If you don't want to support the chocolate industry, then don't. I don't care what you do.

1321
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Make sure that they don't employ child slaves.

1322
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:48,000
Are there chocolate companies that do that? I hope not.

1323
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:49,000
Plenty of them, actually.

1324
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Oh, God.

1325
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Hershey's is one.

1326
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:52,000
Is nothing sacred anymore?

1327
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,000
Like Willy Wonka.

1328
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:56,000
Is there anything not problematic in the world that I could enjoy?

1329
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
I would just be great.

1330
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:59,000
Rob.

1331
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:00,000
What?

1332
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:03,000
What must be done with knowledge and vigilance?

1333
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:10,000
Well, sometimes when I'm shopping at the dollar store for candy, I'm not exactly in my most knowledgeable or diligent mood.

1334
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:13,000
It's just, right?

1335
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:14,000
Alright, anyway.

1336
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:22,000
Speaking of the dollar store, I had heard, I had not checked locally myself, but one of my friends gave me like a heads up type of thing.

1337
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:31,000
That like those Lego dimensions sets that were like $15 at the time they came out were being found at the dollar store for a dollar.

1338
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
So like some of that stuff is like ending up on super clearance.

1339
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:36,000
I did not see that at the dollar store when I was there yesterday.

1340
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:39,000
I did not see that at the dollar store when I likewise was there yesterday.

1341
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:45,000
Of course, there's a dollar store in every other corner. So, you know, it might just be one brand versus another.

1342
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
It's Legos. I would buy them for a dollar. I'd buy that for a dollar.

1343
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
I'd buy that for a dollar.

1344
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:55,000
Hey, so something else before we get into rapid fire news tonight. Something else I've been getting, I guess, told about a lot this week.

1345
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:59,000
Because I know it's sad, but I don't really follow a lot of this anymore.

1346
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:06,000
But, you know, obviously our show was founded because we were all playing DDR together at the arcade.

1347
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:10,000
And, you know, we had a show about the community about that for a long time.

1348
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:17,000
And I kind of feel like the video game company that was making DDR kind of abandoned it for a little while.

1349
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:22,000
Like for years, not doing anything new with it. And then, you know, now it's kind of coming back in the past few years.

1350
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:26,000
But it's kind of one of those things where it's like, yeah, they kind of lost me, you know, at that point.

1351
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:29,000
When they kind of, I feel like they kind of turned their back on it for a little while.

1352
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:36,000
But anyway, all my personal feelings about that aside, the reality is I don't follow this scene as much as I used to.

1353
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:44,000
But I know a lot of you guys do. And I'm sure a lot of you were taking a look at the whole DDR World Championships that were going on this weekend.

1354
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:49,000
Specifically, it was the Konami Arcade Championship. And I guess it was the sixth annual that they were doing.

1355
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:55,000
And it was part of the Japan Amusement Expo. So they did the DDR World Championships.

1356
01:38:55,000 --> 01:39:01,000
And what made this particularly notable was that they actually had some Americans join in the competition.

1357
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:09,000
And IAmChrisForLife, who's one of the Americans who qualified for this, actually won the whole damn thing.

1358
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:15,000
So there it is. And it was all streamed online. People were watching this.

1359
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:24,000
And I was just thinking like, man, how awesome this would have been in like 2007 when we were kind of changing.

1360
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:27,000
No, 2006, we were kind of changing direction on our show a little bit.

1361
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:31,000
Like, I would have loved to be commentating on this and doing more with this.

1362
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:37,000
For me, it honestly feels like 10 years too late. However, again, I'm not knocking it.

1363
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:44,000
I think it's great that like a newer generation or so to speak, like can still have DDR and that it does have a place and is a thing.

1364
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:53,000
And we kind of see a resurgence of it coming up because of places like round one, Dave and Busters that are trying to keep the arcade thing going in America.

1365
01:39:53,000 --> 01:40:01,000
So for that, I think that's really cool. And pretty nifty, Nito, that the first time Americans go to the competition, they end up taking the trophy.

1366
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:11,000
So I think, Nito, how many countries in all participate in this? Is it like, I know a Korean guy had won for the past couple years.

1367
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:16,000
I'm sure Japan, the US now. I'm sure there's gonna be other countries too. But is this like, is this a full on Olympics?

1368
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:21,000
Do we have, you know, over 100 countries represented or is it just maybe a handful? I don't know.

1369
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:28,000
But anyhow, they were, I guess, showing the actual courses they had to play and some of the songs.

1370
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:37,000
And what's funny is that some of the songs I recognize, like Dead End, right? And Paranoia Revolution, or just it must be another Paranoia rebirth.

1371
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:49,000
But Dead End was the groove radar special. So that means it was a different version than what I remember in good old DDR USA mix back at Roseville Golf Land, which actually had Dead End in it.

1372
01:40:49,000 --> 01:41:00,000
And then a song called Egoism 440 was also in it. I don't know what that is. And then what's sad is that I see the guy, I Am Chris For Life, getting his trophy and he looks all happy and, you know, as he should be.

1373
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:11,000
And then it's DDR's main composer, Yulchi Asami, was presenting him the trophy. And I'm like, who is she though? I have no idea who this person is.

1374
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:23,000
And it's kind of sad. Like, I actually don't know who this person is. I remember when Naoki would have been the one handing over the trophy. But, you know, people move on. There's new things to do. What have you.

1375
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:46,000
All right. Let's move on and get into some rapid fire news. I had to acknowledge that because, you know, the roots of the show are in DDR. And, you know, it is cool that even though some of us have fallen out of love with it when Konami kind of wasn't doing anything with it for years, that it can still be there. Anyway, let's move on with some rapid fire news. Loki.

1376
01:41:46,000 --> 01:42:02,000
All right. So I'm kind of happy that, granted, a lot of foreign episodes from Liberty City are now part of the backwards compatibility for Xbox One. That almost gives me a reason to pick up an Xbox One to go back and play those again. But, yep, that's pretty cool.

1377
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:26,000
So check those out if you haven't done so already. And then come along with that. I have an old game coming back. TimeSplitters. They're going to be doing a remake of the original game called TimeSplitters Rewind. And they had a teaser that came out for that. Apparently now it's scheduled to come out maybe in 2018.

1378
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:42,000
But no real words on what exactly it's going to be. But I'm happy that TimeSplitters is coming. And it's a fan-made project, but it's got the go-ahead from Crytek, who owns the right TimeSplitters right now.

1379
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:53,000
That's good. Getting that go-ahead is good because otherwise you get a season desist. So, you know, Nintendo would probably not be giving any go-aheads anytime soon. But something like TimeSplitters, a little different. So, cool.

1380
01:42:53,000 --> 01:43:01,000
Tekken 7. I'm sure some of you guys are looking forward to. And Tekken 7 will be coming out on the PlayStation 4 as well as the Xbox One.

1381
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:12,000
But we have some of the details on the PlayStation 4 release. There's going to be a collector's edition that will have a 12x18-inch figure of Heihachi and Kazuya that are fighting. They're punching each other in the face.

1382
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:26,000
There's also a steelbook and a Tekken 7 soundtrack. There's going to be an exclusive jukebox mode in the PlayStation 4 version of the game, which will let you play songs from all versions of the game series in a mix while you play the game.

1383
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:38,000
So you could, I guess, jam to Tekken 3's soundtrack while you play Tekken 7 if you want. There's also going to be some exclusive costumes for certain characters from Tekken 4 and Tekken 2, so you can kind of see characters in their classic styles.

1384
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:42,000
No word yet on what Microsoft's exclusives will be, if any.

1385
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:58,000
Moving over to Nintendo for a bit. One of the launch titles for the Nintendo Switch that we were saying here on OLR a few weeks ago, that in our humble opinion really should have just been the damn pack-in game, but Nintendo's doing something different with it. We'll see if the risk pays off.

1386
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:10,000
1-2 Switch is the game I'm referring to. Nintendo of Japan confirmed this week that there will be 28 minigames in 1-2 Switch. That's the number of minigames there will be, so it's more than like seven, so I guess that's kind of cool.

1387
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:14,000
Some of the minigames include Wizard and Baby.

1388
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:19,000
Yes, I'm watching the video for Baby right now. This looks fucking stupid.

1389
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:22,000
I'm watching the trailer for Baby right now here.

1390
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:34,000
So you actually hold the Switch like it's a baby, and there's a crying face on it, and I guess you rock it up and down, and it will go to sleep.

1391
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
That's just my face with an actual baby.

1392
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:50,000
This is kind of creepy, actually. Well, now what happens if you do bad? What happens if you shake the baby? Which you should never do. It's a bad thing, but I have to ask the question. What happens if you shake the baby?

1393
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
Does the baby cry more? It dies.

1394
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:57,000
That would be kind of morbid, though, for a Nintendo game, wouldn't it? Don't do that.

1395
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:03,000
And then the wizard looks dumb, too, but it looks like they're doing the wizarding battles of Harry Potter.

1396
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:04,000
Okay, that's kind of cool, though.

1397
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:09,000
It's just lame, though. I'm sorry. This looks so dumb. It's so dumb.

1398
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:14,000
But Loki! Baby! It's a game called Baby!

1399
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:31,000
Yes, because what parents want to do when they're not with their children is fucking pretend to have their children. No. It's dumb. Why did someone put any effort into that minigame? Seriously. Where is the fun in it?

1400
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:46,000
Well, look at that dumbass. He's really rocking that controller like it's a baby. Oh my god, that's so fucking hilarious. I'm so drunk. I mean, it's so... This game should fucking die in a fire. It's absolute garbage.

1401
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:52,000
Alright, let's move on. Some more rapid-fire news, Dark Sakura.

1402
01:45:53,000 --> 01:46:18,000
Well, Bethesda's got some sales going on this weekend, which is pretty much over now, but oh well. Dishonored 2, Elder Scrolls V Skyrim, the special edition, Elder Scrolls Online is also on sale, Morrowind is on sale, Doom is on sale, Fallout 4 with the season pass is on sale for almost half price.

1403
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:27,000
So, if you're listening live, go get them. They're cheaper. It's actually going to be going on through Monday the 13th, so you got a little bit of leeway.

1404
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:50,000
And then, some news on the Marvel edge. Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 is actually when the Evo 2017 fan selection. So, guess what? You can play it now at Evo if you go. And if you don't go, watch it and don't suck.

1405
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
Just play it at home. Play your home version.

1406
01:46:53,000 --> 01:47:11,000
But they tried to get Pokken Tournament added. And Killer Instinct. So, Pokken Tournament won like $67,000 in donations, but Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 took it with $71,690.

1407
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:13,000
That's still pretty close.

1408
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:19,000
They should have just done both. Let the Pokken nerds have their time. Come on. Alright, fine.

1409
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:30,000
Actdeftinchat says, Pokken, fuck UMVC3. See, some people are very upset about this whole situation. Why not just have room for both? Oh well.

1410
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:32,000
Deadpool is not in Pokken.

1411
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:42,000
How many versions of Smash are they doing at Evo? Couldn't they replace one of the versions of Smash with Pokken? I know that might be sacrilegious, what I'm saying, but come on. How many versions of Smash need to be there?

1412
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:44,000
Anyway.

1413
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:46,000
Fifty.

1414
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:53,000
Moving on, let's travel around and check out what's in stores this week. Is UMVC4 out yet, Loki, this week?

1415
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:55,000
No. That's infinite, remember?

1416
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:57,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

1417
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:06,000
No, there's not that. But there are four different games I have on my list here. So, starting off with Deformers. That's on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1418
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:10,000
I see what you did there. Deformers. Because there's four games.

1419
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:13,000
Four. That wasn't intentional, I'm sorry.

1420
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:18,000
For Honor. Hey, all these games have fours in them today.

1421
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:26,000
On PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. Sniper Elite 4 on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1422
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:31,000
And sadly, the one that just has to fuckin' be different, Ride 2 on PlayStation 4.

1423
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:33,000
No, it's now Ride 4.

1424
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:35,000
It's now Ride 4.

1425
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:39,000
Ride 2, 4, Ride 2, and 3 never happened. They were cancelled.

1426
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:41,000
This is Ride 4.

1427
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:48,000
Alright, traveling over to Japan, and on the 16th this week, you can also get For Honor out there.

1428
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:55,000
But you can also get Sango Kushi 13 that apparently comes with a power-up kit.

1429
01:48:56,000 --> 01:49:01,000
That is something that's available as well. Oh, it must be like an online thing. That's what this is.

1430
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:08,000
It's one of those, like, Romance of the Three Kingdoms-looking games, and so I'm guessing the power-up kit is something that gets you stuff online.

1431
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:09,000
Cup of noodles.

1432
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:11,000
It's not cup noodles.

1433
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:18,000
There's also Momo 2G Taisen Ryoku comes out in Japan this week in a regular and a premium edition.

1434
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
So that is something to look forward to on PlayStation 4.

1435
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:27,000
And then Digimon World Next Order International Edition is also out this week.

1436
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
So maybe that's something Dark Sakura will be importing. I don't know.

1437
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:32,000
I don't know her life.

1438
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:48,000
Going over to the Vita, Momo 2G Taisen Ryoku 3 is also out on the Vita, as well as Kamaitachi no Yoru Rene Saisei, and Diabolic Lovers Lost Eden in regular and limited edition out on the Vita this week.

1439
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:57,000
And on the 3DS this week, nothing. There's nothing on the 3DS until March 2nd is the next release date over there.

1440
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
Let's go to the UK, Dark Sakura.

1441
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:18,000
In the UK, we have on the 16th Layers of Fear for Mac, we have The Escapist The Walking Dead for PlayStation 4, and on the 17th we have Californium for Mac and PC, and Rainbow Moon for PlayStation 4.

1442
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:20,000
Swell.

1443
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
Yeah, but the swelling's gone down.

1444
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:24,000
The swelling's gone down.

1445
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:31,000
Alright, let's go to the mailbag. Every week you guys email us. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1446
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:39,000
And Dark Sakura likes to jump into the mailbag, which she surely logged into before the show to be well prepared for tonight.

1447
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:44,000
And she pulls out an email or five to read on the show.

1448
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:49,000
One, I almost said one lousy email, but I'm sure it's a great email.

1449
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:51,000
But it's just lousy that we only got one.

1450
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:52,000
We don't read the lousy ones.

1451
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:58,000
That's true. So anyway, let's get to it. Here's the email tonight. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1452
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:07,000
Hey OLR crew, AZHP here with another report on the Nintendo Switch. I got to try it out after the Zelda escape game, which was fun.

1453
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:17,000
A little on the easy side for an escape game with between a 30-40% escape rate, whereas the other rooms from this company are closer to 5-15%.

1454
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:22,000
After the escape game was over, people who cleared the game were able to try a 20 minute demo.

1455
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:31,000
The kiosk I was on had the same muddy texture problem that Stoppy talked about on the Skype call last week.

1456
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:40,000
However, after finishing my demo, I noticed my friend's kiosk had perfectly crisp 1080p textures that looked better than PS3.

1457
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:46,000
I told an attendant about that and she thanked me for notifying them of the problem and said they would need to fix a TV setting.

1458
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:58,000
My guess is that it wasn't a TV setting, but the Switch was stuck in a portable mode of some sort which downscaled the resolution and it didn't switch properly when docked to the TV.

1459
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
Interesting. It didn't switch.

1460
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:16,000
Hopefully this is a problem Nintendo will fix before the release, because if people like Stoppy and I are going to receive these types of experiences and then speak on social media or podcasts about it without realizing that the Switch actually can output really tight graphics,

1461
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
it's going to harm the perception of the Switch.

1462
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:23,000
God, just imagine if that was the E3 for 15,000 strangers to go play.

1463
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:34,000
Right. With that being said, my other gripe with the system is that the analog nubs feel almost like the PSP analog nub and that there isn't a whole lot of nuance or precision you can apply to the stick.

1464
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:49,000
If you've used a PSP before, you probably know what I'm talking about, but where you can't really input a walk rather than a run, it's basically all or nothing because there isn't a lot of space between 0 and 100% on the stick.

1465
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:54,000
Hopefully that makes sense. So basically it's not very sensitive.

1466
01:52:55,000 --> 01:53:01,000
Or it seems like it's such a small controller there's no space between pedal to the metal.

1467
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:03,000
You need a lot of fine motor control.

1468
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:10,000
You could get one of these really stupid add-ons that you would stick on top of it to raise the height of it so that you can do that.

1469
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
You'll need to play with some nipples to practice.

1470
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
You could just have small hands, like somebody.

1471
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
Built for Trump, good for gamers.

1472
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:23,000
Anyway...

1473
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:33,000
I'm still hopeful about the Switch, but I'm still not going to pre-order one since I'll probably enjoy playing on the Wii U gamepad more than the Switch gamepad given my demo experience.

1474
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:42,000
And if the muddy texture problem is something that doesn't get fixed soon before or after launch, that's going to be a really big problem for people.

1475
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:53,000
I'm trying to get the phrasing on this one, so I guess imagine if the difference between a Wii or even the game...

1476
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
It's phrased funny, so I'll just say it as it's written.

1477
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:02,000
It imagined the difference between a Wii or even GameCube game and a PS3 game.

1478
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:03,000
It was that dramatic.

1479
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:08,000
Anyway, hopefully you've all found this email helpful. I have.

1480
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:13,000
I'm writing it on my phone since the power is out due to the storms we've been having in the Bay Area.

1481
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
Take care everyone, you're truly AZHP.

1482
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:25,000
Thank you, I'm happy to be hearing from people that are getting their hands on this thing around the country as they've been doing that Nintendo Switch tour.

1483
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:29,000
And I heard about the whole escape room, which I totally forgot was happening in San Francisco.

1484
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:33,000
I wanted to go do it, but I'm sure it was a lot of people.

1485
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:35,000
Was it the Resident Evil one?

1486
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
No, there was a Zelda-themed escape room.

1487
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:42,000
I've had a busy month, so I didn't get around to doing it.

1488
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:52,000
I think the Switch tour is going to be in San Francisco at the end of the month, but I'm kind of like, well at that point it's like one week until the Switch releases, so what's the point?

1489
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:59,000
I don't want to go have to fight all those crazy Nintendo fans and stand in line for a few hours to play something that I will be playing anyway in one week.

1490
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:01,000
I can wait. I can wait.

1491
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:06,000
But it is weird to think we're only a couple weeks from the Switch release.

1492
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
We're what, like three episodes away from the Switch release?

1493
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:11,000
It's crazy.

1494
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
Coming out of nowhere at the same time.

1495
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:19,000
JD in chat says it's coming back, there's still an opportunity to do the room.

1496
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:27,000
Oh, that's good. I want to, yeah, come on Nogust in chat says the room is coming back to March, coming back in March to Japantown.

1497
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
Maybe I'll have to go then. That'd be fun.

1498
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:37,000
Just to do the escape room, obviously in March the Zelda demo part won't even matter, but I think the escape room thing would be fun.

1499
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:39,000
Alright.

1500
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:44,000
Well that's it for emails. Participate at orangelandtrader.com if you want to send us an email for a future week.

1501
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
In the meantime, we're going to get to Loki and then we're going to get some calls. Loki.

1502
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:54,000
Alright, so let's talk a little bit about Activision. They had their investors meeting and released some numbers.

1503
01:55:55,000 --> 01:56:03,000
So they brought in $6.6 billion in 2016. I'm assuming most of that is from Blizzard.

1504
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:13,000
Let's see here. That's a 42% increase. They're saying that, of course, Call of Duty and Overwatch were a big part of that.

1505
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:27,000
And they're, of course, touting that they had 447 million players. I guess users spent over 43 billion hours consuming Activision Blizzard content.

1506
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
Alright, good for them I guess.

1507
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:38,000
With that also, of course, this year in 2017 there's not going to be a new Skylanders game, which is good because I think it's getting very stale.

1508
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:43,000
I think it's been stale for a while now and so they're taking the year off because, I don't know.

1509
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:49,000
But they're going to have a new season of Skylanders Academy. If you give a shit about that, I sure as hell know.

1510
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:56,000
In fact, I've tried to pitch it to my kids saying, hey, you want to watch this? And they're like, nope. I have no interest in that show.

1511
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
And so I'm like, okay, cool. Don't have to worry about it.

1512
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:12,000
And also, along the lines of that, Call of Duty, they're kind of reeling it back in. So this year it's not going to be ridiculous space combat, but more traditional combat.

1513
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:21,000
So they're not going all sci-fi. Probably copying the whole EA success with Battlefield 1, so we'll see.

1514
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:25,000
I'm glad Skylanders is taking a fucking break. I think they need it this year.

1515
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:30,000
Yeah, that thing's been driven into the ground for a while now and it's just ridiculous. I don't know.

1516
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:41,000
I just wish the whole Toys for Life thing was cheaper, but the one I want is Lego and Lego ain't getting cheaper ever.

1517
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:52,000
Well, except for the discount I mentioned earlier. My friend said exactly what store it was. I'll tell you where the dollar store is that she saw them at, but I don't know if they'll still be there.

1518
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:59,000
Can't guarantee that. But maybe even places like, not even dollar store, but like big lots. Like there's a big lot that's not far from here.

1519
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:08,000
I was so pissed. Like they had like a $12, like they have these little kid sets that they have sometimes for like Marvel stuff. They had one that had Lego Loki in there and I was like, ooh, I should pick that up.

1520
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:17,000
And I neglected to do that. Now they don't sell it anymore. And that pisses me off because I can't get it now. I'll look online.

1521
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:31,000
All right. Well, uh, if you have an NES classic, which I guess more of them showed up, I saw suddenly on Friday, like I saw a bunch of people on Twitter were suddenly going like, oh, I got mine today. So I guess another wave must have hit this week.

1522
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:35,000
I check every now and then when I'm in a department store and see the electronics section.

1523
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:45,000
You guys know how I feel about it. I can kind of give her to, if one happens to show up at the house. Sure. I'll play it. I'll use the office. We will do some live streaming with it, but I'm not really thrilled to get one.

1524
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:53,000
So, but actually then I hear about this kind of stuff and I'm like, okay, well that's pretty cool. Maybe I want to buy one just to fuck with it. Like everybody else has been doing.

1525
01:58:53,000 --> 01:59:06,000
Uh, and sure enough, you know, hackers going to hack and that's what's happened this week. Um, so, uh, there's a big community of NES classic modders on Reddit because of course Reddit is a place where a lot of people kind of converge.

1526
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:21,000
There's a Reddit called NES classic mods that's available. And, um, there's stuff there on, I haven't, no, I haven't really gone and really dug into the Reddit myself a lot, but as I understand it, there is a tools there for hacking the system.

1527
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:49,000
Uh, and apparently things like hacking the NES classic to run ROMs of games made for other consoles. And there's a YouTube out there now where the NES classic emulates things like Metroid 2 Return of Samus on the Game Boy, The Legend of Zelda Link's Awakening on the Game Boy Color, Pitfall on the Atari 2600, Sonic the Hedgehog on the Sega Genesis, and Super Metroid on the Super Nintendo.

1528
01:59:49,000 --> 02:00:05,000
Meaning that little chip that's powering the NES classic is good enough to be running Super Nintendo games, which really isn't that surprising. I mean, it's a Linux PC. Yeah. Yeah. And you consider like, what are those, what do they call the things you, the tiny, tiny, tiny computers you get for like 30 bucks?

1529
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:06,000
Raspberry Pi.

1530
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:16,000
That's it. Raspberry Pi. Like a Raspberry Pi can fucking around Super Nintendo games at full speed on it. So why can't the NES classic? And you're right. They're just basically little tiny Linux computers. Like it's basically a Raspberry Pi type of thing.

1531
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:22,000
And, you know, where, where, where there is technology, Linux will be installed on it.

1532
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:23,000
If it's not already.

1533
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:41,000
If it's not already. Uh, and I'm sure Linux is then the way that you get all these emulators and so forth. Uh, so yeah. Uh, these, uh, these programs are, were put in with, uh, what's called Hack Chi 2, uh, which several NES classic modders came together to build.

1534
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:53,000
Uh, they say it's actually relatively easy to install and let you put all kinds of games on the NES classic. So Loki is currently in the computer looking, so have fun.

1535
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
Oh no, I was just looking at something else.

1536
02:00:55,000 --> 02:01:02,000
Gotcha. But, um, yeah, so when you get your NES classic, Loki, are you planning to put a bunch of other crap?

1537
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:06,000
Uh, yes, of course. That's really the main reason I want it.

1538
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:17,000
All right. All right. So, uh, yeah, we'll see, uh, if Loki gets his hands on one or if I just decide to finally fricking jump and get one, we'll see.

1539
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:22,000
Anyway, Dark Sakura, you got no time for the NES classic though, cause you have other things to look forward to, right?

1540
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
I got alien butt.

1541
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:32,000
Um, Mass Effect Andromeda is supposed to have customizable characters for multiplayer.

1542
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:47,000
So instead of just having whatever is there or, you know, give your Krogan pink armor and call her Krogal, like I might have done, or, you know, uh, a Drell named Kermit.

1543
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,000
A very limited palette, basically.

1544
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:56,000
Yeah, very. Um, that you are supposed to be getting a little bit more customization for your multiplayer. So that's pretty cool.

1545
02:01:56,000 --> 02:02:09,000
I mean, I did kind of like how Dragon Age Inquisition did their multiplayer, that you just had preset characters that you could play as and they were their own character with their own story that actually had an effect in the game.

1546
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:22,000
They were, you would send them on missions and Isabella was in there. Anyway, so, um, they haven't really given too much about this, but say that, um, it's going to be, uh, certainly a bit better.

1547
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:43,000
So, and of course we're going to find out in March when the game is released. Also, um, they're also pretty certain that, uh, some of the regular multiplayer characters as well have alternate skins and that you might be able to put them through, um, uh, cosmetic changes with transactions.

1548
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:50,000
Not microtransactions. Even a tenth of a cent is a transaction. So, bite me.

1549
02:02:50,000 --> 02:03:05,000
Um, also, uh, as far as, um, the romance options, PB is a romance option. She's a Dorbz. And there is a Lady Turian named Vetranix. Because Turians are the best.

1550
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,000
So you can romance a Lady Turian this time?

1551
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:08,000
You can romance a Lady Turian.

1552
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
What about the, like the only human is what, Liam?

1553
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
There's a few.

1554
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:15,000
Well, there are women in the game, Rob.

1555
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:19,000
Sorry, I have my eyes on the men.

1556
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:30,000
There, there are other human characters on the team. And a Salarian. Yeah, there's, there's all over the place. I think it would be funny to romance a Krogan. That would just be funny.

1557
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:44,000
Um, but anyway, um, the hope is that there may be like some kind of open beta so that people will kind of get their hands on it before and also test for things like, you know, servers and stress testing and stuff.

1558
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:49,000
Well, last week there was that demo story, right? There was going to be a demo a few days before, so there's that.

1559
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:52,000
That's only if you were in the early access for Origin.

1560
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:53,000
Oh.

1561
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:59,000
So, but it'll be out on March 21st and I will be playing it on my poor dying computer.

1562
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:03,000
I was going to say, I think that's an EA club thing that you sign up for.

1563
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:04,000
Oh.

1564
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:05,000
Your premium.

1565
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:10,000
You're not going to get that, suck that money out of me, EA. Nice try.

1566
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:11,000
Nerp.

1567
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:13,000
All right.

1568
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:19,000
Uh, well, I'm looking forward to be able to customize my character, uh, without being limited to what I only get in loot boxes.

1569
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:24,000
Although I guess some of it will still be loot boxes, but hopefully not too bad.

1570
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
All right, uh, Loki, what do you have for us?

1571
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:29,000
All right, so let's talk about Nataku.

1572
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:32,000
Not Kotaku, but Nutaku.

1573
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:45,000
And Nataku, for those who may not know, it's a hentai game website that you can download or play online hentai games and that kind of sort of stuff.

1574
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:53,000
So what they're doing is they actually have their own crowdfunding platform called the Red Light crowdfunding platform.

1575
02:04:53,000 --> 02:05:01,000
And of course, Red Light or Kimochi is dedicated to adult games.

1576
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:05,000
So you can go back different projects, including different visual novels.

1577
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
That's a funny name for it too.

1578
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:08,000
Kimochi?

1579
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:09,000
Kimochi Red Light?

1580
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:13,000
Well, Kimochi is, uh, like feelings, sensation.

1581
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
So it's an apt name.

1582
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:16,000
Yep.

1583
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
So you can go back different projects on there.

1584
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:22,000
Um, and of course, you know, teams are developing that stuff.

1585
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:26,000
So like, for example, they've got, it looks like several visual novels.

1586
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
There's some strategy games, some clicker games.

1587
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
I'm all about clicker games.

1588
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:33,000
Just what Loki needs, more clicker games.

1589
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,000
So yeah, go check it out.

1590
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:39,000
And that's it, of course, um, Kimochi.co.

1591
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:43,000
That's K-I-M-O-C-H-I dot C-O.

1592
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:44,000
All right.

1593
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
Uh, one more story here for you guys.

1594
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:50,000
Then we're going to open up the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

1595
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:57,000
Uh, and that is a brand new update for Super Nintendo's NBA Jam Tournament Edition.

1596
02:05:57,000 --> 02:06:00,000
Obviously, this is an unofficial update.

1597
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:07,000
But, uh, apparently somebody has put together a ROM hack for NBA Jam Tournament Edition on the Super Nintendo,

1598
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:12,000
which it doesn't really affect the gameplay, but what it does is it affects some of the game rosters,

1599
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:19,000
so that you can actually use players in the new NBA Jam Tournament, uh, or this newer NBA Jam Tournament Edition that's been hacked.

1600
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:23,000
You can use players that are actually out there now, like LeBron James.

1601
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:29,000
Um, and then you also get teams that were not in the original game, Toronto, Memphis, and so forth.

1602
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:33,000
Uh, so all the players have had their attributes edited to match their current abilities.

1603
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:39,000
Uh, and then you can also unlock NBA legends, like Kobe Bryant, Michael Jordan, and so forth.

1604
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:40,000
So that's pretty cool.

1605
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:49,000
And in the classic style of NBA Jam, there are also pop culture and political characters that can be unlocked.

1606
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:56,000
So you, you know, like, cause remember in the old, uh, 91 or 92 NBA Jam, when it first came out, you could play as Bill Clinton, right?

1607
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:57,000
Yes.

1608
02:06:57,000 --> 02:07:00,000
You could play that and, uh, so you could like unlock, uh, political figures.

1609
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:08,000
So of course, uh, now in NBA Jam 2K17, you can unlock Donald Trump and you can unlock Hillary Clinton.

1610
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:12,000
So you can fight that battle all over again if you like.

1611
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:19,000
But if politics isn't your thing, you could also unlock characters like Kanye West and Harambe.

1612
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
Because of course...

1613
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
He's not going to move very fast cause he's dead.

1614
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:32,000
Because of course it's on the internet.

1615
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:35,000
So somebody fucking put Harambe in it.

1616
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:39,000
So there you go. That is all a ROM hack.

1617
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:43,000
So it's very unofficial and not going to be supported in any official capacity.

1618
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:49,000
But I'm sure there's some people that will be downloading this and probably putting it on their NES Classic Minis now at this point.

1619
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:55,000
And there's so many people in chat that are like, God damn it. God damn it.

1620
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:59,000
This is why we can't have nice things in response to the whole, uh, Harambe, uh, being in the game.

1621
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,000
So there you go.

1622
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:07,000
Uh, anyhow, let's open up the Skype line over at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

1623
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:09,000
That's Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

1624
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:12,000
Uh, Loki, while we wait for some calls, do you have any last minute news you want to get out?

1625
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
I don't.

1626
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:15,000
What?

1627
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:16,000
Sorry.

1628
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:17,000
Wow, we must have covered all the bases tonight.

1629
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,000
Well, we do have some calls coming in, so let's get to it.

1630
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

1631
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,000
Hey, this is Akdeft.

1632
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:25,000
Hey, Akdeft. How you doing, buddy?

1633
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,000
Uh, kind of good. Kind of good.

1634
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
Good. What's up?

1635
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:35,000
Well, um, I want to talk about, uh, Marvel vs Capcom 3 on an Evo.

1636
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,000
Yeah.

1637
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:41,000
Um, where do I start with this?

1638
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:47,000
Marvel vs Capcom 3 is an old, really old game.

1639
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:55,000
First of all, I don't know if you watched the last Evo, well, last year's Evo.

1640
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:59,000
I think I saw one of the championships, but that was about it.

1641
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:05,000
I think I might have seen Street Fighter 4's championship, but I didn't watch a whole lot of Evo otherwise.

1642
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
Well, basically...

1643
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:11,000
I'm not super into fighting games, to be fair. Like, I like them.

1644
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:17,000
You know, I'll play them here and there, but I don't get into the scene like other people do, if that makes sense.

1645
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:25,000
Yeah, yeah. Basically, to give some context, last year, if I remember correctly,

1646
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:33,000
Marvel vs Capcom 3 had the lowest participant account last year.

1647
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:43,000
Like, they had, I don't remember if just over 500, maybe less than 1,000, but I don't remember exactly.

1648
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:56,000
Even games that aren't as popular like Killer Instinct, I think Mortal Kombat had more participants that year than Marvel vs Capcom did.

1649
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:59,000
Because, again, that game is old.

1650
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:13,000
The tiers don't change that much. I think they pretty much use the same three or four characters over and over again.

1651
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:19,000
And it's just boring to watch. It's boring. It got boring to watch.

1652
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:32,000
Okay, I'm gonna ask a tough question here, though, because knowing that you're a fan of Pokken, and knowing that Pokken narrowly lost the spot to UMVC 3, is this bitter feelings here?

1653
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:37,000
Are you only dumping on UMVC 3 because you're really mad it's not Pokken?

1654
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:59,000
You know, I know I'm a fan of Pokken. I love the game, and I would have given anything to see Pokken instead of Marvel vs Capcom, but any of the other games that they announced for the fundraiser, it would have been perfect.

1655
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:07,000
I mean, there's a community for Killer Instinct that would have loved to see it again at EVO.

1656
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:11,000
Well, I was gonna say Killer Instinct was in it last year, if I remember right.

1657
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:23,000
But yeah, it's still getting updates and so forth, and I'm surprised even that even Killer Instinct, Microsoft at least in this part, isn't supporting it for EVO.

1658
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:33,000
ARMS would have been a weird choice, but at least it would have been different. Don't know about the other games. Maybe School Girls?

1659
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:46,000
I don't know, maybe it is some of the resentment, but again, there were so many other choices that they could have gone to.

1660
02:11:47,000 --> 02:12:01,000
And Marvel vs Capcom, I don't remember if it came out in 2011 or 2012, but again, the game is getting old, it's getting stale.

1661
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:13,000
It's not even worth watching, because again, the characters won't change, the tiers won't change, it's the same strats over and over again.

1662
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:23,000
At least with Pokken, you have some strategy to it, with the Rock Paper Scissors thing, but I don't know.

1663
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:42,000
If I was an EVO organizer, I would have just skipped Marvel vs Capcom, because Infinite is coming next year, most possibly, and people are probably hyped about that.

1664
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:54,000
I know that it's already released on the PlayStation 4, the upgraded version, the HDR version, but still.

1665
02:12:55,000 --> 02:13:15,000
Is there plans that you know of for a second Pokken game? I feel like this game kind of does better, especially as taking it seriously as a fighting game, than I think a lot of people anticipated originally.

1666
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:29,000
But I really feel like the demand is probably there for a sequel, and the fact that maybe this is something that should be on the Switch, because again, the Wii U, having not sold a lot of units, had a more limited scope of who would play it.

1667
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:44,000
Yes, I realize Pokken is in the arcades, and that's a whole other element of it, but I would think Pokken, shouldn't we be getting that on the Switch? Like a new version of it, or at least Pokken Tournament with all the extra stuff or whatever?

1668
02:13:44,000 --> 02:14:00,000
Yeah, and I'm going to remember an article since Pokken and Street Fighter V, I think, came out at the same time, and Pokken sold more copies than Street Fighter V at the moment.

1669
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:18,000
Most possibly, I'm pretty sure it's getting a sequel, because that game pretty much sold in the Wii U, even though not many people probably played it or even know of it.

1670
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:38,000
If not a sequel, at least support, because the arcade does have the updates and the new characters. So maybe an update with all the characters from the arcade in a new version, maybe?

1671
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:49,000
Maybe, but I don't know if Bandai Namco wants to port it, but it would be kind of dumb not to do it.

1672
02:14:49,000 --> 02:15:01,000
Yeah, I really think they should take another shot at it on the Wii, and maybe even get it a bigger audience, and maybe that could make the difference to raise the money to get Pokken in it next year, if it doesn't just get in on its own merits.

1673
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:12,000
Yeah, and the controls for Pokken are really simple, so you can pretty much use the Yoikons, so it wouldn't require that much work on it.

1674
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:25,000
Yeah, true. Alright, well, actdeft, sorry to hear that Pokken didn't make EVO, but hopefully there'll still be plenty of Pokken content to consume out there in places like Twitch and so forth, and still a good competitive scene out there for it.

1675
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:31,000
Yeah, there's at least a Pokemon Championship, so hopefully it gets its place there, but yeah.

1676
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:35,000
That's true. Alright, my friend, I'm gonna let you go to get some more calls, but thanks for the call.

1677
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:36,000
Hey, thanks for having me.

1678
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:37,000
No problem. Bye.

1679
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:45,000
OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype if you want to call in tonight. 1-877-GAMO-LR if you want to do it the old school way.

1680
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:48,000
Let's get to another call. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

1681
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
Hey, what's going on, everyone? It's Ranma.

1682
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:51,000
Hey, Ranma, how you doing, buddy?

1683
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:54,000
I'm doing pretty good. How is everybody else?

1684
02:15:54,000 --> 02:16:06,000
I'm good. Tired. Between Pokemon Go, and I don't know if I mentioned this on the show, but I hosted Rocky Horror last night, so that kept me up to like 1.30, so I'm tired.

1685
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
Did you get some coffee at least?

1686
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:19,000
Oh, God, you better believe it. I had coffee on the way to San Francisco yesterday. I had coffee this morning. I had coffee before OLR, and I'm supposed to be cutting back on coffee, but some days, that ain't gonna happen.

1687
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:21,000
Now, was it Dunkin' Donuts coffee?

1688
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:32,000
No, because the nearest Dunkin' Donuts is like not that close. I have to go basically all the way to Roseville or Folsom, which from where I'm at is kind of far. I know you don't even know where these places are, but they're far.

1689
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:38,000
It's the other side of town. It's like going to one of the other boroughs, Ranma.

1690
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:49,000
Well, I have to make sure I send you some Dunkin' Donuts coffee, because evidently, I did send you a package. It was supposed to arrive Saturday, but thanks to the post office, you won't get it until Monday.

1691
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:52,000
I didn't know you sent us a package. I'm excited.

1692
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:58,000
Yes, and there are explicit instructions on the package to not to open until the next show.

1693
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:05,000
Oh, okay. All right. I'm excited what this could be. All right, all right.

1694
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:10,000
I refuse to give a hint because you might figure it out that easily, but I wanted it as a complete and total surprise.

1695
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
All right. Is it coffee?

1696
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:13,000
No.

1697
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:17,000
Okay. I was like, dang, I figured it out real quick.

1698
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:19,000
Vacuum sealed donuts.

1699
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:31,000
To be fair, I do want to point out, we can get the Dunkin' Donuts grounds at Target, so they sell that, and then the K-Cups, they sell at Baskin-Robbins, believe it or not, because it's all, I guess, the same chain or whatever.

1700
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:33,000
Yeah, it's kind of the same company, yeah.

1701
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:42,000
When those first came out, it wasn't that way. I remember on one of his trips out here, JV Mon brought the K-Cups before you could get them out here, but now you can get the K-Cups out here.

1702
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:51,000
Especially since the whole Keurig thing really blew up in popularity, and it's like they sell those things everywhere. The Dunkin' Donuts stuff's pretty easy to find out, too.

1703
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:53,000
Sounds good to me.

1704
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:55,000
So what's on your mind tonight?

1705
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:58,000
I want to talk about a game review.

1706
02:17:58,000 --> 02:17:59,000
Okay.

1707
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:02,000
All right. Now, Jamie.

1708
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
What?

1709
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:09,000
I'm going to play a song. I want to know that you can identify this song.

1710
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
Okay.

1711
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
Yes.

1712
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:17,000
Hot-blooded downtown story.

1713
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:21,000
Or, as we had it, River City Ransom.

1714
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:26,000
Yes. I want to talk about River City Ransom, Tokyo Rumble for the 3DS.

1715
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:27,000
Okay.

1716
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:28,000
Oh, okay.

1717
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:43,000
I will say this in a nutshell. It is amazing. This is how you do a proper port with retro graphics. The soundtrack is up to date. It is amazing. This is a great game.

1718
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:49,000
That's quite a compliment to it. Tell us a little more.

1719
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:57,000
All right. Basically, the plot of the story is there is a new gang in town, and they're causing trouble for Kunio and his crew.

1720
02:18:57,000 --> 02:19:05,000
So Kunio decides it's best to find some of his friends who run other gangs to run this main gang out of town.

1721
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:12,000
It's your basic side-scrolling, punch-kicking. Now you can do three buttons, so you can actually jump, punch, jump, kick.

1722
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:17,000
You can still pick up all of the classic items from the original game, plus you can level up your character.

1723
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:18,000
Well, that's pretty cool.

1724
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:27,000
And you get the option of switching between multiple characters throughout the game to level them up. You can buy clothing for better, for armor, for weaponry.

1725
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:33,000
And you can do unlockable minigames such as dodgeball and, I believe, basketball.

1726
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:35,000
That sounds fun.

1727
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:36,000
Yeah, it sounds super fun.

1728
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:44,000
And the best part is it's just the original game. They just translated it and left all the original voices intact.

1729
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:47,000
So it's just like playing the original NES version in a way.

1730
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:50,000
Fun. Do they barf?

1731
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:51,000
Yes, they do.

1732
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:52,000
Awesome.

1733
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:55,000
Some of the characters do barf.

1734
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:56,000
Rad.

1735
02:19:56,000 --> 02:20:03,000
And what's cool is you still hear that sound effect when you defeat them, plus there's an audio effect of them barfing.

1736
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:05,000
Fabulous. Fabulous.

1737
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:08,000
It's not the same if there's no barf.

1738
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:12,000
Any type of street passing or multiplayer involved, since it's 3DS?

1739
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:20,000
Not to my knowledge, because I think I'm the only one in my area with the game, so I haven't gotten anything to pop up in regards to it.

1740
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:28,000
Alright, well that's okay. I was just curious if that was a feature, since it is 3DS and that's something we're doing on that system.

1741
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:29,000
Definitely.

1742
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:37,000
I know there is two versions. There's the regular version, then there's the limited edition, which comes with a Kunio keychain.

1743
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:40,000
And I got lucky and got it for $34.99 online.

1744
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:41,000
Nice!

1745
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:42,000
Not bad.

1746
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:46,000
Yeah, I believe I actually linked you to that once.

1747
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:47,000
Did you?

1748
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:48,000
Yes.

1749
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
Okay. Sorry.

1750
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
Way to stay on top of all your messages, Dark Soccer.

1751
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
You know what?

1752
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:59,000
I wonder if it's on the eShop. If I just want to be lazy and play it tonight, get it on the eShop. I'll have to look.

1753
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:00,000
You know what?

1754
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:08,000
It might be, but you know what? This is one of those games that's worth having a physical copy, because I believe only a limited print of these is going out.

1755
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
Mmm.

1756
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,000
Agreed. They didn't get it.

1757
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:24,000
They probably had somebody that was too young when River City Ransom first came out to really appreciate it.

1758
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:34,000
Yes, and I will say as much about the original. This was one of those games I would sit there and play it all damn day, because I did not care for that password screen.

1759
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:41,000
I'm like, I'm just going to play, pause the game, come back, and keep playing, and just pray that my NES doesn't freeze.

1760
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:46,000
Well, video games are supposed to be fun, and if you're having fun with the game, then more power to you.

1761
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:47,000
Mm-hmm.

1762
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:48,000
Yeah.

1763
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:52,000
Alright, my friend, I'm going to let you go to try to get maybe one more call before we wrap up for the night.

1764
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:53,000
Awesome.

1765
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:54,000
Thank you. You take care.

1766
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:55,000
You too.

1767
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:56,000
Alright, bye.

1768
02:21:56,000 --> 02:22:03,000
OrangeLoungeRadio. All one word on Skype. If you want to do it the old school way, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1769
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:04,000
Let's see.

1770
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:11,000
Oh, Dark Tetsuya says, actually, I meant Double Dragon 4. I don't know what IGN gave River City Ransom 3DS in all fairness.

1771
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:19,000
That's a correction there from what I said in chat from Dark Tetsuya, because Dark Tetsuya had said before that in related news, I'm kind of curious about Double Dragon 4.

1772
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:21,000
That's what else we played at my house, by the way.

1773
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:22,000
Yeah.

1774
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:23,000
It was Double Dragon 4.

1775
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:32,000
But my response would honestly still apply. It could still be somebody too young to recall the original Double Dragon and kind of, you know, playing that on the NES.

1776
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:36,000
I don't think those games hold up well over time. That's me personally.

1777
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:41,000
But, DarkSakura, you guys, did Dan get Double Dragon 4? Have you guys been playing that at all?

1778
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:51,000
Yeah, Dan actually finally beat it by using a Bobo, or as I've been calling him, a Dobo, because I've been hungry for Filipino food lately.

1779
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:52,000
Sure, sure.

1780
02:22:52,000 --> 02:23:02,000
And basically I've been calling him every flavor of a Dobo, including Green Hulk, a Dobo, because he's actually got the green version with the purple pants that looks like the Hulk.

1781
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:03,000
So it's funny.

1782
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:04,000
Yes, I remember.

1783
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:11,000
And then the one I can't remember who I always refer to as a self-immolation man, because when you beat him, he blows himself up.

1784
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:12,000
Right.

1785
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:20,000
And then there's like these really annoying Kunoichi in the game. Just really annoying. But finally beat it.

1786
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:27,000
All right. Well, I guess that is going to wrap it up for the Skype line tonight. But if you want to still get in touch with the show, you can always send us an email.

1787
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:31,000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1788
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:33,000
So no last minute stories, Loki? Nothing else that came through?

1789
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:52,000
Just a note about the latest patch for Overwatch, the PTR patch. Apparently there's an issue with Bastion right now that if you use the passive ability Ironclad, as well as, I guess, I guess in Sentry Tank mode, it reduces damage by 35%.

1790
02:23:52,000 --> 02:24:00,000
Then there's another bonus that's Ana's Nano Boost that does an additional 50% damage reduction, making him pretty much unkillable.

1791
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:01,000
Oh, interesting.

1792
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:15,000
I heard about the Bastion changes on PTR. They've been kind of trying to make Bastion a little more like something that because Bastion is kind of the character not a lot of people are playing, even though fucking I got play of the game with Bastion in a Mystery Heroes match.

1793
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:22,000
Because again, it's so easy to just sit there and make a turret somewhere and then just pick everybody off if they don't know where you're at.

1794
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:36,000
So yeah, Bastion still does have its usefulness, but I do kind of see where he's also like, if you make the smallest mistake and give away Bastion's location or whatever, he's so squishy and really easily defeatable.

1795
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:37,000
Not anymore.

1796
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:48,000
Yeah, not anymore. Although it is a test realm, so that could possibly change. And Nano Boost is also really situational. It doesn't last forever. Ana only is able to power you up for a few seconds.

1797
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:58,000
So I mean, I actually am kind of okay with him being mostly invincible as part of Ana's ultimate, if that's what they want to do, but we'll see. We'll see.

1798
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:07,000
Alright. Well, I guess that's gonna do it for another edition of Orange Lawn Radio. Thank you guys so much for tuning into the show tonight. We appreciate all the support.

1799
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:17,000
If you like what you heard here at Orange Lawn Radio, please tell a friend or five about the show. Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but you know, only if the voice is out there to use them.

1800
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:32,000
So we'll go around and give everybody's final thought for the night. My final thought for the night is I want to play more, I think I actually do want to play more Oblivion, but maybe I just want to get into Skyrim HD already.

1801
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:41,000
Being surrounded by all the Elder Scrolls fandom is starting to finally rub off on me a little bit, I think. But then, of course, when Mass Effect comes out, it'll all be over because alien butts.

1802
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:43,000
You still need to play well with me.

1803
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:46,000
It's a monthly fee. You gonna pay my fee?

1804
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:48,000
I might for a month, if you play with me.

1805
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:52,000
We'll see, we'll see. I heard the cost of those, I heard the cost of those.

1806
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,000
It went up to $80,000.

1807
02:25:54,000 --> 02:26:06,000
Because, do you know why that happened? Because Blizzard made it so that you can use those tokens to either buy a month of WoW or redeem $15 of Battle.net credit.

1808
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:12,000
So people are now using them to buy the $15 in Battle.net credit to get loot boxes in Overwatch.

1809
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:16,000
So that's driven the prices of them way up.

1810
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:17,000
Fuckballs.

1811
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:21,000
Yeah. Anyway. So, Dark Soccer, your final thought for the night?

1812
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:22,000
Resist.

1813
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:24,000
And Loki, your final thought tonight?

1814
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:31,000
My final thought is when I was speaking with Gabriel earlier this week, he was telling me, you know, I was just explaining my situation at hideout time or anything.

1815
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:39,000
He said to make the smallest game I could possibly make, so that's, I guess, what I'll do. Make the smallest game I could possibly finish.

1816
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:41,000
Alright, so next week we're gonna play it?

1817
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:45,000
I don't know. I already have an idea, so we'll go from there.

1818
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:48,000
Here we go again. Another idea. Another one of Loki's ideas.

1819
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:52,000
I have tons of ideas. I have lots of ideas and I write them all down.

1820
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,000
Make it. Make it. Alright.

1821
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:58,000
That is it. That's gonna do it for tonight's episode of Orange Launch Radio.

1822
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:04,000
Thank you guys again for tuning in and listening. We will be back in seven days to do it all over again.

1823
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:10,000
Until then, be nice to each other online and playing games and stuff. Don't be rude. Bye.
