Orange, Lounge, Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Tonight, new Pokemon come to Pokemon Go, so you've got to catch them all, just like one YouTuber caught a Nintendo Switch this week. But you know there's more to that story, coming up on the show where every gamer has a voice.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange, Lounge, Radio

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange, Lounge, Radio. Live tonight, episode number 676 for this February the 19th of 2017.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:01:03,000
My name is Rob Roberts coming to you live out of our little studio N7 here in Sacramento, California with my co-host not here tonight, DarkSakura. Jamie Summers is out for the night. She had a pretty nasty cough or something and she was a little worried about doing radio for three hours when she had the plague over in the corner.

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So hopefully she's feeling better, taking the opportunity to rest up or what have you. And by saying rest up with my quotey fingers, what I really mean is she's replaying the entire Mass Effect trilogy in anticipation for Andromeda, which I don't blame her.

8
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I may or may not have made that up, but let's be real, it's true. But who is joining us tonight? Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

9
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Hello. Hi Loki, how are you doing?

10
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Fine, looking for my USB cord that I thought I brought, but apparently I didn't.

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
USB cord? What's that for?

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I charge my phone.

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You have his iPhone, right? Or Android?

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Android.

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I can steal Alan's thing in the bedroom if you need.

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'll just turn off all the...

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Please, please. This is a nerd household. We have chargers, Loki, if you are for sure.

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I specifically remember taking the charger off because I had my controller plugging, my DualShock 4 charging, and I took it out and I rolled it up.

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And then that's the last I remember of what I did with it. I thought I put it in my bag, but it's not there.

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I've never lost one of those.

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Yeah, I think our mini-USB, I don't know what happened to it. I don't know if it's the one that I sent to my buddy Brad from PodCulture when he bought the PlayStation 4 because I wanted to make sure he had one.

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I don't know if that was the one, but then it's like, well, my PS4 Pro should have had one, right? And I can't find it.

23
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And I don't know if I maybe used it to charge a Vita somewhere or what it is, but I'm missing one of those controller cords.

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So I ended up using, I had to find like a, we have like a cell phone charger that I use on my PlayStation 4 to charge a controller, or which actually I have two controllers now, thanks to a very lovely Christmas gift.

25
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So when one dies, I just, oh, get the other one on and save the day. I can go right back to Overwatch. That works.

26
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Hey, not just us here in studio, but you guys, of course, always joining us live every week because we do tape live at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

27
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:07,000
That's vognetwork.com. And of course, there's lots of comments in our chat, including, come on, Noel Gus, who's starting us off tonight saying, OMG, how many Gen 2 Pokémon has Sky caught already?

28
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm going to say at least 20. I don't think it's that high. I know we're going to get into the whole Gen 2 Pokémon thing a little bit later, so I don't mean to ruin it, but I know it's been on a lot of his minds.

29
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And the thing is, I wanted to go out and catch as much as I could because it's been raining like crap here. And I think you guys have seen the news, the rain in California.

30
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Now, a lot of what happened right at the end of the week affected Southern California more. We're not there. We're in Northern California. You might remember we started off last week's show.

31
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:48,000
We talked about what was happening IRL, and that was the whole Oroville Dam thing, which I know made national news. That's, you know, we're far enough away from all that, but that's still, you know, I've been to Oroville several times.

32
00:03:48,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I used to live up there. So, I mean, there's not in Oroville. I lived in Chico, which isn't far. It's where all the people were evacuating to. But anyway, the weather's been on everybody's minds up here, and now we've got like another big storm coming in.

33
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So, my point is, it's great that they released all these Pokémon, but it's been fucking raining every single day. I can't go out and enjoy it. But it wasn't, there was a little bit yesterday, it wasn't really raining yesterday.

34
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It was actually a lovely day. So, I was able to go out and do some catching. So, while I was talking there to buy time, I actually was bringing up my Pokédex because I wanted to see what it was currently at.

35
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So, I'm at Kot 160, scene 171. And I think I was at 142 before Gen 2 launched in Kot, so that means I would have 18 of them. And that sounds about right. I think I have about 18 of the new Pokémon.

36
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:46,000
A few from Evolving and so forth. I got one of those King Stones or whatever that lets you do a Slow King, which apparently are really rare from Pokéstops.

37
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Where do you get those from?

38
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Pokéstops. They just, they randomly show up when you hack Pokéstops. But you know, with the Pogo Plus, sometimes if I'm running low on Pokéballs, I'll drive through downtown on my way home.

39
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
So, I can just buzz, buzz, buzz. I can be safe and drive and not actually play. All I have to do is push a button, which is very, very easy to do.

40
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So, on one of my trips through downtown is when I got that King Stone right after Gen 2 launched. I was able to do that. So, that was nice.

41
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Anyway, let's see. Bobby Blackwolf, our pal in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

42
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:27,000
We were pissed when Pokémon Go came out, that it came out when it was 100 degrees outside. Now we're upset about a little water. Make up your mind, gamers.

43
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,000
We're gamers. We complain about everything. Remember, Bobby? What's the website, Bobby? Come on. Gamershateeverything.com.

44
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
That is the truth. Remember, Bobby? You built that site. You should know that.

45
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Let's see. What else here? Maya in chat says, It snowed all of twice this winter here in Chicago.

46
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yeah, that's so weird that like California is getting drought ending precipitation. Like, they said it would not take, we would not be able to fix the drought with a year of rain.

47
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Well, guess what? Now they're saying, at least for Northern California, they're saying no more drought in Northern California. So, California is a different story.

48
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So, it's just kind of, you know, I think the funniest tweet I saw all throughout this was something like, We have prayed for five years for this drought to end.

49
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Maybe we should have spaced that out a little bit and not prayed all at once. Sorry. It's funnier if you read it on Twitter.

50
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Anyway, actdev says, Use your Go Plus and take an umbrella. Yeah, I know. If it's light rain, I'll wear my hoodie and try to like walk short distances and do it that way.

51
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Or I could just be a fool and play it in the car. I don't know. Anyway, we'll read more of your comments throughout tonight's show over at live.vaganetwork.com.

52
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:44,000
But I want to get into tonight's kickoff topic. Actually, I have two things. First, I want to do a follow up real quick, because we talked a lot about E3 and the fact that E3 was opening up to the public last week.

53
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And we sat here on the show and said, Oh, it'll be gone in 10 minutes. Like, if you're not there, the minute it opens, you're not getting a ticket. Well, turns out that didn't seem to be the case.

54
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Now, I do know a few people that did get an E3 ticket. And even though I talked about my personal reasons why I am not interested in going, I'm still really happy for my friends who have either not been in a long time, or have never been, who are going to get to go.

55
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:18,000
And you know what, I hope all my cynicism about E3, I hope it's proved wrong. I hope they do whatever they need to do to make it, you know, the party that people are hoping to sign up and go to.

56
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I remain skeptical, but I would love to be wrong about that for the sake of my friends who are going to get to go for the first time.

57
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:35,000
But even though, you know, I know a few people that bought tickets and are going, it doesn't seem like it sold out that fast. In fact, I'm not sure, question mark, I don't see it on E3's Twitter that they ever sold out.

58
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Did they not sell 15,000 tickets to E3? Because in my opinion, especially compared to PAX, that's really surprising.

59
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
The tickets are probably much more than PAX, obviously.

60
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Not by much. What is it, $2.49 for E3, Loki? E3? This was supposed to be the show when we, especially when we were like in high school and stuff.

61
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It used to be the show.

62
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Do you think some of this negative chatter, I mean, from, I don't, I'm sure we're not the only podcast kind of sitting out there going, well, E3 isn't what it used to be today.

63
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I think there's a lot of, I think even I caught some of that cynicism in some pretty major websites that were running pieces on it in talking about the show opening up to everybody is that people were kind of saying like, well, people might get a ticket, but it's not going to be what they expect.

64
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Do you think some of that cynicism caused this to happen? Or what do you think? Do you think it's, or, I mean, and to be fair, is it just as simple as the con, the con is a Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, which is kind of a really bad time for, you know, 20 somethings to

65
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I think it's a lot of things. I think, you don't really do that anymore to like find out what stuff, you know, is coming out. Nowadays, they stream everything. Before it used to be, oh, we'd stream like the big three and that's it.

66
00:08:50,000 --> 00:09:02,000
But everything's being streamed now. It's all presentations. And if you want to just see the titles, you don't actually want to get hands on with them, which to be honest, you're not necessarily guaranteed to get hands on with anything when you go there.

67
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Then you can just stay at home and do all that. You don't need to force your way down there and spend three days. And honestly, a lot of times when I'd spend three days down there, I would come out with less information than had I just absorbed it all through streaming.

68
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Now William Murderface in our chat over at live.vognetware.com says, I'm pretty sure you can't buy general expo passes anymore. So maybe they did disappear and I somehow missed the memo on this. However, I think it's safe to say it certainly didn't sell out as fast as a PAX does.

69
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Which is probably why they didn't talk about it.

70
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I think that's a point that merits discussion, still a little bit. The holiest of holy gaming shows did not sell at the rate that many of us anticipated it to.

71
00:09:49,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And also, I think this time, at least compared to some of the other times when they had Kensha Hall, there's less to see, I think. It's more of just like, are you going to see everything in a couple days?

72
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Well, you know, I was thinking about it this week and I know at one of the last E3s I did go to, they had a pretty good chunk of the floor where they actually had like old arcade games that you could play. They have like a video game museum type thing set up.

73
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
That's cool, but I'm not paying $250 to go play old arcade games.

74
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:22,000
But what I'm saying with that is that we've seen a little bit of a shift where things like that are showing up at E3, so maybe there's just going to be more of that this year.

75
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I mean, I do feel like there's a lot of space still on the first floor that they, at least again, I can only reference a show I went to a few years ago, but I remember they used to have an art show in the middle between the two concourses.

76
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Seems like you could cram a lot more in there. I mean, no disrespect to art, but you could, it was not a lot of art filling up a very big space. Like they could put the art in a smaller space and have more gaming type stuff in there.

77
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I mean, I don't know. There's a lot of things they could do. I still think there's a lot of space on that first floor they could kind of fill out a little bit.

78
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:01,000
And maybe they're still going to do stuff out in the parking lots and all this stuff. Or maybe even the next door thing. We haven't really, really heard if any of that's going to get utilized.

79
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Get some sweet multiplayer going on with Switch games by that time.

80
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Switch or who knows, Microsoft, you know, we'll get into it later in the show, but it's no secret that they've got a new system for the holidays that they're going to be pimping.

81
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Maybe Microsoft wants to show off some of the sweet 4K visuals or whatever else they're going to end up pimping with this system.

82
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,000
So, you know, I'm just interested to see how E3 is going to transform with all this. We'll see.

83
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Going to some other comments in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, DungeonBuster says,

84
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:39,000
E3 also doesn't offer many of the same things that PAX does. Dealers, tables, cosplay events, game rooms, etc. That can be a draw for some people.

85
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Well, they do have an official E3 store. I got an E3 shot glass for Alan one year.

86
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Or the Disney term, a toothpick holder. Did you know you can get a shot glass at Disneyland, but they call it a toothpick holder.

87
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
They won't call it a shot glass, because Disney. Fun fact. Let's see.

88
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Maya in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, E3 is trying to remain revenue positive in the face of many big names abandoning the show floor.

89
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
15,000 paying attendees will help. Yeah, we did talk about that a little bit.

90
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You know, 250 a pop is no small, you know, that's going to be what, like $4 million?

91
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
That's probably what a couple of these companies were paying to be out on the show floor.

92
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:26,000
So, I mean, it's a creative way to make money, I suppose. But at what cost to the show itself?

93
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Or maybe what benefit? We won't know until E3 happens this year.

94
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Or we get some more details on what exactly those 15,000 people are going to get to experience. So, we'll see.

95
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Anyway, just a little bit of follow-up. I wanted to make sure we properly followed up with that.

96
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Because believe it or not, when we do miss the mark on something, I'm willing to talk about it.

97
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I mean, all we can do here sometimes is speculate and be a little bit of armchair predictors.

98
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
And sometimes we get it right. In fact, more than I think we get credit for, we get it right.

99
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
But sometimes we're going to get it wrong. And I think it's good to sit down and talk about, well, why did we get it wrong?

100
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And we learn from it. Anyway, let's talk about something a little more positive, actually.

101
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Because there's a lot of negativity out there in gaming and the community and so forth.

102
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
And I know we have some rough stuff we're going to get into with the Switch tonight.

103
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,000
And I know people don't want us to be Debbie Downers 100% of the time.

104
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:29,000
So I want to focus a little bit, especially since this week was Valentine's Day, or Singles Awareness Day as the case may be.

105
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Whatever it was you were celebrating on the 14th, I hope you had a fantastic time.

106
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:40,000
If that was eating a nice dinner with a loved one or eating discount chocolate by yourself, I hope you had a fantastic time.

107
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
But since Valentine's Day is a, using my quoting fingers again, holiday about love,

108
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I thought we could talk a little bit about, without getting too cheesy, I thought we could talk about video game moments that you love.

109
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
And why, you know, what are the things that happened in video games?

110
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
What are those moments that you really fell in love with in games that make you a gamer today?

111
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,000
And I open this up to our chatters. I really, really would love to hear some of your comments over at live.vognetwork.com.

112
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Or if you are not engaged in chat, but you want to send a tweet real quick, at OLR.

113
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I do have my phone up and I can read some of those tweets as well.

114
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:20,000
A video game moment that you loved that, like, after it was done, you were like, okay, I'm a gamer.

115
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Like, this is why I'm a gamer. This is why I put up with all this cynical bullshit online.

116
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
And this is why I dredged through gamershateeverything.com and all this stuff.

117
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
And I am still a gamer at the end of the day. This is why I'm a gamer.

118
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
So, Loki, we need to hear from you. What are video game moments?

119
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
And it doesn't have to be like a classic story. It could be something recent.

120
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Old, new, what's a video game moment you loved?

121
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Well, let's see. Just thinking off the top of my head here, because there's a lot of moments that I love in video games.

122
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Some of them, like Bobby had mentioned, some of the story beats in Saints Row IV.

123
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Nothing really in Saints Row IV. But in Saints Row III, though.

124
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I would say the introduction to Saints Row III really does qualify as like a video game moment that I love.

125
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I do. It's just because it's so excessive and ridiculous.

126
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
It's fantastic.

127
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Yes, right? And Loki, you love that shit even more than I do. Like the over-the-topness in video games.

128
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I don't know how else you can justify your fandom of Earth Defense Force.

129
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You know, it's hard nowadays because I didn't talk about it last week when Earth Defense Force 5 was announced.

130
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
How many Earth Defense Force games do we have to have come out where they're just like,

131
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Oh my god, these are brand new aliens coming in!

132
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It's like, my god, you get fucking tasked by ants all the time.

133
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Positivity, Loki, positivity, positivity.

134
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:51,000
No, it's definitely, you know, I'd say the intro to Saints Row III and then also the part where you're taking over the penthouse where it's set to power.

135
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I mean, that was pretty awesome.

136
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Actually, this is a hell of a bunch of stuff from Saints Row is pretty awesome.

137
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
So, there's a lot of moments there.

138
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
And then, let's see what else.

139
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Kind of not so much cheesy, but like, the beginning to Bioshock, well, the beginning of Bioshock 1, you know, when you're going down.

140
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
And then the beginning of Bioshock Infinite, or just like, whoa.

141
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I remember the intro to Bioshock Infinite.

142
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,000
And those were even games I didn't like super get into as much as everybody else, but that intro to Bioshock Infinite is something else.

143
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
It's just like, it's like, damn.

144
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Yeah, it really makes a good argument for like, you know, games as art type thing. It's just really impactful, I think.

145
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,000
And Bioshock's ending. I mean, that whole series, I think, is a big heart for a lot of people.

146
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Gosh, well, I would say, you know, with this show, shit.

147
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I mean, we were born our show out of the DDR scene, and there's a lot of stuff in the old school music game days that I really loved.

148
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Like, I really loved that community that we had back in the day, you know, that we would meet at the arcade and play this loud, obnoxious video game.

149
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
But there was just something so cool about it because it was just, I don't know, it was just different, you know what I mean?

150
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Like, it wasn't your typical video game. It was something where you were using your feet as a controller, and it was playing really bad techno music.

151
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
But it was okay to like this techno music because, you know, it was fun, and you were having exercise.

152
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
And I was never thinner in my life than those years I was playing DDR.

153
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I mean, that was a moment that I really loved in gaming, was just, you know, back.

154
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:33,000
And that's why if I'm a little bitter betty towards Konami sometimes, it's because, you know, not just the recent stuff that's going on,

155
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,000
but the fact that I felt that those games were really abandoned after DDR Extreme, that for some reason they really just turned their back on it.

156
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
And I think all these years later, I have more insight to it.

157
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Or just hearing some of the tracks in like DJ Hero were just like, you know, because it's all unique stuff.

158
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:56,000
And it was very cool to hear some of that stuff mashed up and actually get to build that as you're kind of playing. It was pretty awesome.

159
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
But I wanted to say a follow up on the DDR thing real quick. That's why I thought it was cool.

160
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Like, you know, we got to talk about DDR again a little bit last week with the, you know, the representative from the United States winning the national tournament, or the international tournament, excuse me.

161
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:14,000
That was kind of cool to talk about, even though I feel bad where it's like, you know, I really, I don't follow this series like I used to anymore.

162
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:22,000
So some of this admittedly goes over my head, even though, hey, I still have to go to round one and my damn near 40 year old ass will still get up on a DDR machine.

163
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:29,000
And I don't give a fuck if anybody thinks like, oh, old guy on DDR, because you know what, I was playing this game before you kids could even walk.

164
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
But I thought it was cool that it was like DDR was kind of like back out there.

165
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:40,000
And so if that makes a new generation discover and Konami's found a way to strike gold again with it, then I think that's awesome.

166
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
So, I mean, that will certainly be a series that's always going to be near and dear to me.

167
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
MMOs, let's think about MMOs a little bit and moments I really loved in MMOs.

168
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:59,000
You know, I can talk about World of Warcraft and raiding and all that, but really, like, I think the first like, oh my God, I love this moment would really date back to Final Fantasy 11.

169
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Yeah, Final Fantasy 11.

170
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
We're all playing that together.

171
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:10,000
One of those games, like the sense of scale of it was pretty awesome because when you first start off the game, you know, I start off in, was it Ron Fro or whatever.

172
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
And just like that first area seems so huge.

173
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
And then it's like, oh yeah, there's places beyond this. Like you can go way beyond this.

174
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
And it's just that sense of scale is like, oh my God, this is ridiculous.

175
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I don't know how I'm going to handle being able to go out there and get killed immediately.

176
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Yeah. Or the fact that you team up, I think for me it was like teaming up with people and like actually taking on quests together.

177
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:41,000
And like one of the things that jumps out in my mind, like I know there was like the early questing in the Valcrum Dunes where you're getting XP and all that stuff.

178
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:51,000
But I'm thinking of like when we all teamed up to do like Promivian or something like that in one of the expansions where it's like you had to really work as a group and to get through some of this stuff.

179
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
You know, it's kind of like, it was like a raid of sorts back in the day for that game.

180
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:02,000
And I thought that was a moment that like for me it was like, wow, this is, I don't get a moment like this in gaming really otherwise.

181
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,000
This is a new experience with MMOs and I'm really thankful for it. So there's that.

182
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Let's see what else. Trying the Oculus Rift for the first time and doing that Surge demo.

183
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:30,000
You know, especially where you get, for those who haven't played it, there's a part in it where there's these giant like things walking by and that just kind of like, whoa, this is fucking cool.

184
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:40,000
And actually even with the PlayStation VR with Rush of Blood, I mean that's just, that's such an awesome game and the fact that, you know, it's come so far.

185
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:47,000
And even watching, like one of the things I was doing this week, because, you know, as I mentioned, I'm doing stuff in work, it kind of relates to gaming.

186
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Of course, I can't really go into details on that, but I've been introducing a lot of people to VR and watching them play some of this stuff for the first time.

187
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:05,000
And just kind of like get that moment that I had where they can kind of look around like, holy shit, this is ridiculous.

188
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I didn't realize this was a thing. I've heard about it, but to actually experience, it's like, oh my God, this is actually going to be the next big thing. It's just, that's, I love that.

189
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Going to some comments in chat over at live.vognetwork.com. I'm sorry, I'm not going to be able to read all of these, but some things that are jumping out at me.

190
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Vidpower in chat says, the moment I realized I'm a gamer, 100% Super Mario World. Oh my God, the first time, Christmas Day, hooking up the Super Nintendo and getting to play Super Mario World for the first time.

191
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:45,000
And it's like, I mean, the NES was another, I'm playing Super Mario Brothers, the very first one, but like playing the Super Nintendo where it was like with Mode 7 and shit, where it was like the graphics were so next level.

192
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
You know, again, for that time.

193
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Or Super Mario 64.

194
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Oh my God. See, I didn't really go through that because I didn't get on the Nintendo 64 bandwagon until way later.

195
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:01,000
That was kind of, there was a period, because I was around college and when I went off to college, I wasn't as into video games for a little bit.

196
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:07,000
So I kind of missed the boat with Nintendo 64, but still, I mean, yeah, I mean, I can imagine, you know, playing all that for the first time.

197
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,000
But, oh my God, Super Mario World was just like, blew my fucking mind with all the Mode 7 and all that.

198
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Let's see.

199
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:20,000
SSG100Matt says, regarding the over-the-top comedy, I fell in love with the South Park Stick of Truth for the over-the-top comedy.

200
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Yes, that's a good one. That's a good one.

201
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Let's see.

202
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Dungeon Buster says, flying to another planet for the first time in Phantasy Star on the Master System.

203
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Maya said, I just finished my first playthrough of the Mass Effect trilogy and I loved how personally I took some of the choices my Shepard made.

204
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Games can really take you places sometimes.

205
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I mean, absolutely. I know Loki doesn't understand this the way that Dark Soccer and I do, but especially with the extended cut.

206
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:58,000
You know, because I went back and I did the original ending and it was fine and, you know, we've talked about it on the show and I'm not going to, but like, I thought the ending hysteria was way overdone and that people really blew that out of proportion.

207
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
However, I am very thankful for the extended cut because I like that even more.

208
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:12,000
And like, I think one of the most recent moments in gaming that really made me love gaming was the synthesis ending in Mass Effect extended cut.

209
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I realize that's a controversial ending and I realize the reasons for it, but despite however you feel about the synthesis ending and what it means, I think the way it was done was so well done.

210
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:38,000
And Battlestar Galactica played six. Trisha Helfer does such a good job narrating that. That's one of my favorite voice acting performances in video games, like it all.

211
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Speaking of voice acting, one of the biggest moments that I ever loved, the first time I played a CD-ROM game.

212
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:56,000
King's Quest 5, I think I can't remember if it was five or six, I think it was five, was on CD-ROM and like actually hearing the voice acting as I'm playing a Sierra game.

213
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Because let me tell you, a game like King's Quest 4 was epic enough, but to play King's Quest 5 with the narration and the voice acting just mind exploded.

214
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
That was just, that was just unheard of.

215
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Games on CD? Let's see. Akuma JP says, mine is mostly when game companies set a new bar in game technology, mostly from Square Enix.

216
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Yeah, you want to talk Square Enix? How about the opera scene in Final Fantasy 6? That's going to resonate with me.

217
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I mean like that was, oh my god, like I didn't know a game did this. Like that was just unheard of for games at the time.

218
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I mean the ending for Final Fantasy 4 was so good enough, but then that happened in Final Fantasy 3 and it was like you weren't prepared for it.

219
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:56,000
My other one was, I remember it was our senior trip in high school, or maybe it was high school, junior high or high school, I think it was high school that we went to Great America.

220
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:05,000
And I don't like roller coasters, so that's fine, but I went to the arcades there and one of the games that they had there that you could pay like 5 bucks to play was Galaxian 3.

221
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Where you go inside, it's an arcade in a room and it's just this giant screen that you're working together to shoot stuff in. That's fucking awesome.

222
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Yeah, the whole working together for things like they do, I can't, somebody in chat will know, but the game they have all the conventions where you're doing like the Star Trek thing where everybody has their own different role that they're playing.

223
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Bridge crew now?

224
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Is that it? Bridge crew?

225
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
That's a new one that's coming out.

226
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Bridge commander, something like that? Somebody in chat's got to know what it is.

227
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Artemis! I knew the chatters, there was like 5,000 people on a row, Artemis. That's the one, yeah.

228
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Like that is, I haven't done that yet so I can't say, oh that's a gaming moment I love, but I think that's really cool.

229
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:52,000
And in a way, something like that I think fuses the best of a Dungeons and Dragons-esque RPG with video games.

230
00:25:52,000 --> 00:26:04,000
And that's why I think something like Artemis and those types of games are really cool is because I think it's really taking a lot from a gaming in a pre-video game era and how you work together in those games.

231
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:16,000
God, that would be awesome. Do they have anything like this? Like, you know, where you're playing a game, almost it could be like Diablo or something like that, where you have a DM running the game kind of outside the game.

232
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Like you're all playing co-op in the game and there's someone DMing the game that's basically doing stuff.

233
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
So Neverwinter Nights.

234
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Is that Neverwinter Nights? I don't know, I've never played Neverwinter Nights.

235
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Kinda, kinda. The chat over at live.vognetwork.com, I'm loving these responses, I've got to read a few more here. Let's see.

236
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Clever username here says, the last of us, starting the generator in the basement, so scary.

237
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Yeah, oh man.

238
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Oh yes, the Battletech pods, that is awesome.

239
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Yeah, the chatters talking about that, yeah.

240
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Maya says, the ending of Persona 3 stunned me in my chair for a solid 10 minutes, that was an incredible moment.

241
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Vidpower says, my favorite old MMO game was playing Phantasy Star Online. Holy shit, yes, Phantasy Star Online.

242
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Like, I can't believe I didn't think of that when I was thinking of MMOs, talking about the Final Fantasy XI thing.

243
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:16,000
But absolutely Phantasy Star Online, that was crazy how like your Dreamcast, using the modem, would call in to the Sega BBS.

244
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
No, it wasn't that, but it was like through, I don't know, American Online Connection or whatever, you were playing.

245
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I don't even remember how it was done. Did you, did you just have to, oh you just had to call a basic internet provider, right?

246
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:32,000
You just had your internet that you called in on the Dreamcast and then you could play that online. It's crazy.

247
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I remember back in the day when you did call a BBS to play like Doom 2.

248
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
That's how you would play, oh man, then they wanted to charge for every minute that you played.

249
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Let's see, just a few more from our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

250
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Bob Coffee says, Street Fighter II was the game that pretty much set me as a gamer in stone, though.

251
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Good choice. I mean, Street Fighter II, that was the arcade scene for like the longest time, right?

252
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I mean, I wouldn't consider myself a big fighting game aficionado, but shit, even I had my years on Street Fighter II.

253
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Like, I distinctly remember one night, I was randomly in Southern California, I was on this bus trip with other kids my age, long story.

254
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:20,000
But we were at this, I don't remember if it was a store or what, I feel like it was a laundromat for some reason we were there.

255
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,000
And they had a Street Fighter II and there were these guys that were on the machine for like a long time.

256
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:34,000
And I went up and I went to play and I played as Chun-Li and they laughed because I picked Chun-Li because, you know, gamers can be jerks sometimes.

257
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:40,000
But I kicked their asses, you better believe it, I whooped them with Chun-Li over and over and over again.

258
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Like, I won a ton of matches in a row, finally I walked away and I felt really good and I wish I could be that good at video games again.

259
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
But I'm not.

260
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:57,000
ActDeft brings up fighting games as well, playing Smash Brothers with friends, it's awesome.

261
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Let's see, trying to get a couple more comments in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

262
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:09,000
S2100matt brings up escape rooms, which I think is also kind of like the whole D&D and gaming hybrid there.

263
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:16,000
And let's see, BlackWolf in chat says there was a Vampire the Masquerade game that had the DM mode, redemption I think.

264
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:25,000
And DarkTetsuya says he has a similar experience, my first time on Super Street Fighter II I picked Kami and just destroyed everyone.

265
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Kami was awesome.

266
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Super Street Fighter II was like, whoa, they redid the graphics, it looks even better and now you've got all these new people.

267
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Blows my mind.

268
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Anyway, that was good.

269
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:45,000
That was a good walk down memory lane and some of those reasons why, despite all this other blah that goes on in gaming sometimes, we kind of stick with it.

270
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Because it's just these moments, these key moments that really affect us, that really make us gamers.

271
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
So thanks, thanks for walking down memory lane with us.

272
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Although S2100matt does bring up, nobody said Qsar. Yeah, Loki, he didn't say Qsar.

273
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Well, I didn't really consider that a game.

274
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Qsar did have an arcade.

275
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
He did have an arcade. He had played lots of arcade games.

276
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
No, I definitely considered Qsar. I thought of it, but it's not really video games.

277
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Yeah, it's not a video game, but certainly...

278
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I mean, it sort of is. It's a computer game, I guess.

279
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
It's an extension, a little bit.

280
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Alright, let's move into a little more recently.

281
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Maybe not games you love, necessarily, but games you still played this week.

282
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
How was your gaming week, Loki? Start us off.

283
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
What kind of video games did you play this week?

284
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,000
So I played mainly Skyrim, still.

285
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I mean, I'm still just plugging away at that.

286
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I did, because I didn't really play the expansions too much when it first came out.

287
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
So I played some of the...

288
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Well, I don't really know if you can actually do anything or quest in this, but...

289
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
It's the...

290
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Har...

291
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Was it called Hearthstone? I don't remember what it was called.

292
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Basically, the house building thing in Skyrim.

293
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
So I built a house.

294
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Because I wanted to have kind of a location that I could do all my enchanting stuff and all that.

295
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
So I have that, and then...

296
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I did more quests in there, and just kind of playing through it some more.

297
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Because I'm cheating, but not cheating.

298
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I'm exploiting glitches in the vanilla game without using mods.

299
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I'm having more fun with it than I did with mods.

300
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Because mods were just too crazy, and it didn't work.

301
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Well, what I put in there didn't quite work right.

302
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I don't know, it just wasn't as fun.

303
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
So...

304
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I did that, and then...

305
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
What else? I played...

306
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Actually, quite a bit of PlayStation VR this week, because I've been demoing stuff, like I said.

307
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,000
So I got to try a little bit more Job Simulator, just for a sec.

308
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I did Rush of Blood, and still really enjoy that game.

309
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I played...

310
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Pokemon Go for a little bit, because I was doing some of the Gen 2 stuff.

311
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,000
And I'm a little over it now, but I just caught what I could that's in the area.

312
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Of course, now it's like 14 different things that are still around, and then that's it.

313
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
It's like, okay, well, crap. There's not really much more.

314
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Very little Ingress. I played a few minutes of it, probably.

315
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Anyone else?

316
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Yeah, that was pretty much it, honestly. I didn't really get to play a whole ton.

317
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
My Gaming Week. I did some more live streaming this week.

318
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Cheap plug for my Twitch channel over at Rob Roberts on Twitch.

319
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
But I actually did some Final Fantasy XIV.

320
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I played some Overwatch, and I gotta say, Alan and I did some Overwatch, where he was playing with me.

321
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
And you can see him on the Twitch stream.

322
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
But we had some really good matches in Overwatch.

323
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I ended up highlighting it and putting it on YouTube.

324
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I loved the match so much.

325
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:58,000
It was one of those things where the enemy had the thing at 99%, and we ended up in an overtime that went on for minutes.

326
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
And finally, we took the point, and we ended up winning that particular match.

327
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
It was quite the turnaround, and that was in Mystery Heroes.

328
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
So I think I had Mei or somebody I don't usually play.

329
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
But yeah, it was a lot of fun.

330
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I had some really good moments in Overwatch this week.

331
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
And then some bad moments, too, because today I was playing with friends, and we were not winning anything.

332
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
But Mystery Heroes can be such a crapshoot.

333
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,000
It's like if you just get the wrong comp, you're not getting any tanks or any healers.

334
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
It can just be a disaster.

335
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
So Mystery Heroes is a crapshoot in that regard.

336
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
But it's still fun to play with friends, and that's the important thing, am I right?

337
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
So I've been playing those games a bit.

338
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Let's see, continuing on with some of the other standbys as well.

339
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,000
But one of the games I did play this week that I was randomly getting into, I suppose.

340
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Do you remember how last week I talked about that I was randomly playing Oblivion?

341
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Because it was on the Xbox 360 backwards compatibility.

342
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
So wish I had remastered that, because that'd be awesome.

343
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Well, you need to check out what Alan does with the mods.

344
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Well, yeah, I know. I can do that on my PC.

345
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I think I have Oblivion on my PC. I don't know if I have it.

346
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
He spent like three days setting up mods in Oblivion.

347
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
And now I watch him, and I'm like, it doesn't even look like the same game.

348
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Like, I know it's Oblivion, but it looks even better. Like, it's gorgeous. Like, my god.

349
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Like, I don't have a laptop that supports it.

350
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,000
It's funny, I was actually working on my coworker's laptop the other day,

351
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:25,000
and he has a new MSI laptop that's like an i7 with a GTX 980 inside there.

352
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
I'm like, shit, man, I need to get a new laptop.

353
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Fuck this Asus shit. I'll just go with an MSI one, because those are some nice-looking laptops.

354
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
And then I can do all that cool shit.

355
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Right now, though, this fucking Radeon fucking AMD is my only choice at the time,

356
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
because I want a dedicated GPU, and they're very minimal.

357
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Price-wise, it's affordable, but fuck, I miss my GeForce.

358
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
So I actually did end up playing a little more Oblivion, even.

359
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I ended up closing the first Rift, which is part of the story and all that stuff,

360
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
so I played a little further.

361
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:07,000
But then I was like, why am I sitting here playing Oblivion when I still have yet to really play Skyrim?

362
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I take that back, because I did play Skyrim quite a bit, but I didn't really finish it,

363
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,000
and I didn't do any of the expansion stuff, so there's a lot more I could do in Skyrim.

364
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
And I went on Amazon, just out of the blue, and I checked.

365
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I was like, how much do they want for Skyrim Special Edition?

366
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I was like, oh, shit. It's on sale for 30 bucks.

367
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
All right. You win. You won this time.

368
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,000
So I bought Skyrim Special Edition on Xbox One, and I opted to get the Xbox One version,

369
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,000
because the mod support is a little better on Xbox One, right?

370
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,000
So the first thing I did when I got it, and I got the game yesterday, and I finally went in to check it out.

371
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:49,000
I didn't realize you needed a Bethesda.net account, which you can't sign up in the game.

372
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
You have to bring up your phone or go on the website. That's what I had to do.

373
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
It's a little silly, but whatever.

374
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:03,000
And then I started looking at the mods, and I was like, there's nothing really in here I think I want to install right now.

375
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Well, and then the other thing is, it makes very clear that if you use the mods, you can't get any achievements.

376
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:15,000
And I was like, oh, well, let me play a little bit vanilla to get some achievements,

377
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:21,000
and then maybe I'll look at some of these graphic improvement mods and some of the other things they're talking about.

378
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,000
But I gotta say, having not played Skyrim in a long time, but now playing Special Edition for the first time finally,

379
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,000
on my big TV that does the 60 frames a second and all that, it does look really good.

380
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Skyrim Special Edition does look really, really good.

381
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
And it makes me excited for what they might do with an Elder Scrolls VI.

382
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
It's gotta happen someday, right? It's gotta happen. It might not be this year, but next year or something.

383
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
They gotta do an Elder Scrolls VI at some point, right?

384
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
So it makes me very excited if Skyrim kind of looks that good.

385
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
And how old is it? I mean, it's several years old.

386
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
But obviously they've gone through and they've bumped up a lot of the graphics.

387
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,000
But if you haven't seen it yourself yet, it is worth a look.

388
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
It depends on what kind of games you're into, if I would recommend you just jump in and buy it or what have you.

389
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I think you should. I mean, honestly, I've spent...

390
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
How many times have I replayed through Skyrim? Several times.

391
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
And you never actually finished the game.

392
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,000
But I spent hundreds and hundreds of hours in that game.

393
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
It's definitely worth 30 bucks. I mean, come on.

394
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Okay, I gotta respond to this little... I'm detecting a little bit of tone in this comment in our chat over at live.vognetware.com.

395
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
A clever username here in chat says,

396
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Looking for best mod support, buys console version.

397
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Now, hold on a minute.

398
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Alan owns it on PC and we can do the whole Steam library share thing.

399
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,000
So there is that. And I do own the original Skyrim on PC,

400
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,000
but I didn't get the upgrade that just upgraded it for free to the newer version.

401
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
If I wanted to do that, I could do it through Alan's account.

402
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Well, you didn't own the DLC on the...

403
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
No, I didn't own all the DLC and that's why I didn't get the free one.

404
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
But Alan did do that.

405
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,000
But, sometimes, you just want to plop your ass on the couch,

406
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
play the game with a controller,

407
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,000
and zone in on the big 60 inch TV, which is way bigger than even my dual screen monitors are.

408
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
So, I think there's some things to be said for the console experience.

409
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
And I just, yeah, I wanted to just play it on console.

410
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,000
But I'm not, you know, not saying there isn't a lot of good stuff going on on PC,

411
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:17,000
because obviously, you know, if you want to talk to Alan about how much he's modded Skyrim, it's insane.

412
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
And it's also, like, having done both,

413
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
there could be a little bit of setup required with the PC version versus the console.

414
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Console's more like you just toggle that shit on.

415
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Granted, you can't do as much.

416
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,000
But after a while, you just, you know, you get tired of seeing all the bare-breasted and floppy dongs

417
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
and, like, Thomas the Tank Engine.

418
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Are you sure? Are you sure you can get tired of that?

419
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Where's that stuff on Xbox One? I didn't see the...

420
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
They don't have...

421
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
They don't have the Macho Man thing where the dragon comes out?

422
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I thought they had that already. I do think they have that.

423
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
That would almost be worth giving up achievements for.

424
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
And, like, Battletoads and, like, you can play as, like, all these different followers.

425
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
I saw the one that was, they did have this on Xbox One.

426
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,000
It was, like, The Temple of Time featuring the Hyrelian Sword.

427
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Like, they changed the name just enough so that, like, we're not completely ripping off The Legend of Zelda,

428
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
but we totes are.

429
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Like, even in the graphics and everything.

430
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
So, when I do get into mods, I want to check out, like,

431
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I want to check out the really, like, terrible rip-off stuff like that.

432
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Or, my favorite on PC was the dubstep spell.

433
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
The dubstep gun spell. It was awesome.

434
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
He's just like, he casts that and everybody explodes.

435
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
That's Saints Row IV, right?

436
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
There's another moment I love.

437
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
The dubstep gun. I mean, that's awesome.

438
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
It's so stupid and ridiculous.

439
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
They're just like any of the guns they have.

440
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
They're shark gun. I mean, chum gun.

441
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Or the giant purple dildo bat. Hello.

442
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Giant purple dildo bat. Yeah, absolutely.

443
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Zeba brings up Charizard dragons.

444
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Is that a thing? Of course. It's got to be a thing you can do in Skyrim.

445
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Of course. Of course. It's on the internet. It's got to be.

446
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
So, you can just change all the dragons to Charizard.

447
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
It's like, what is it? The Tommy Wiseau horse and stuff that you can get.

448
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
It's weird.

449
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Oh, hi horse.

450
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
It's weird.

451
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
There's some weird shit.

452
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
That's amazing.

453
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Alright, anyway, I guess that's really it for my gaming week.

454
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I played a little Skyrim and I mentioned all the other stuff.

455
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
So, I'll try to play a little more Skyrim as the week goes on.

456
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Anyway, let's get into some gaming news, of which there's a lot this week.

457
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Because I don't have a lot of announcements or other housekeeping to talk about.

458
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Besides, I guess I can always plug our Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

459
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
We're also on Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

460
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
So, you know, follow us on social media.

461
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Let's get into news. There's a little bit going on this week, right, Logie?

462
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Yeah, there's been some video of the Nintendo Switch coming out.

463
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Well, how's that? Is Nintendo releasing some video?

464
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:48,000
No, they're not. Because, allegedly, one leaked out. Allegedly.

465
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:54,000
According to Nintendo, earlier this week, individuals claimed to prematurely purchase a small number of Nintendo Switch systems.

466
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:00,000
From an unspecified retailer. Nintendo has determined these units were stolen in an isolated instance.

467
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:06,000
By employees of a U.S. distributor with one system being legally resold.

468
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000
The individuals involved here have been identified, terminated from their place of employment.

469
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,000
And are under investigation by local law enforcement authorities on criminal charges.

470
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
And the Switch will be launching on March 3rd.

471
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Okay, I've been dying to ask you this question all week.

472
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,000
You used to work in video game distribution. You don't anymore. You've changed industries big time.

473
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:31,000
But, what, like, is this, like, could somebody have done this?

474
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,000
No. And the reason no one could have done this is because we don't get it, you wouldn't get them that early.

475
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:44,000
They, let's play this way. In the world of retail and game sales, distributors are in the fucking bottom.

476
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Aside from independent retailers. They're below them.

477
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:56,000
But, seriously, they're not getting that product until as early as possible to street, or as close to street as possible.

478
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:04,000
So, for example, this is coming out March 3rd. Most likely, I think, if I'm correct here, March 3rd is probably a Friday.

479
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Yes, it's a Friday. So, most likely, they would be getting that product on the 1st.

480
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:16,000
And the reason for that is because they are fucking paranoid about this.

481
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:23,000
They're fucking paranoid of this. And they would never, ever ship that fucking early.

482
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Especially Nintendo. They'd be lucky to get any at all.

483
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,000
But, to be fair, things may have changed since you left the industry.

484
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,000
And did you say something about, like, a GameStop distribution could be different?

485
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:43,000
It could maybe if, you know, they're shipping to GameStop. Although, I wouldn't think, you know, maybe they're shipping to their main distribution center and then it's going out from there.

486
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:54,000
That could possibly be, you know, a situation where they'd ship earlier, but for an independent distributor, there is no fucking way they're getting it that early.

487
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:02,000
No way. There's no reason to do that. They wouldn't ship that early and just have it sit on shelves because they know there's too much temptation to break street.

488
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:08,000
There's all these possible things that could go wrong. Which makes me think, they did this themselves.

489
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
As some sort of viral marketing.

490
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
That's a hell of a claim, Loki. That's a hell of a claim.

491
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Because I just, I don't buy that this is how this stuff got out.

492
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:30,000
But, I just, okay, like, I, my thought is, and you know, this is a very complicated story here where, you know, obviously the person who leaked it is not being 100% truthful.

493
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:36,000
And has kind of got caught on a few things, right? Like, wasn't there like a Reddit post where they were trying to flip it? Like, sell it or something like that?

494
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
There's all this, there's all this kind of like shady stuff going on.

495
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
It's very possible that they got it somewhere, but I just don't think-

496
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:47,000
But a viral thing, Loki? I don't, like, why can't Nintendo just answer these fucking questions? Or put out a video themselves?

497
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:53,000
I think a lot of, I think something like that would go much more viral than this NeoGaf post.

498
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Which, yes, went viral, but I think if Nintendo did a direct, way more people would see it.

499
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:03,000
And they could just say, here's what you've been waiting to see, here's what the Switch interface looks like, and here's what's going to look like day one.

500
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:13,000
I don't know. I just, I find it hard to believe that this was from a distributor. Just because, like I said, they don't get product that early. Ever. Ever.

501
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:18,000
So something that, that part of the story doesn't add up to you and it kind of just throws-

502
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:25,000
I just know Nintendo. I've been through two console launches with them. 14 years in the industry, okay?

503
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:33,000
It's not, and I can tell you from 14, well okay, we haven't, we weren't selling games for 14 years, but for at least 5 years of that.

504
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Maybe it was more than that, but at least 5 years. Never once have we gotten a console that early.

505
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Never. Ever. From any Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo, never happened. Never. There'd be no way that they would do that.

506
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Now my assumption was, when I heard about all this, is that it was a press thing that got into the wrong hands.

507
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:01,000
That I could believe if it got, like if someone leaked out their press kit or something, because I know the press have them now.

508
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Yeah, and I'm not talking about like video game sites even, because when we say the press, that could even be things like the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, you know.

509
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
That would be more plausible.

510
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:18,000
I would think, oh you're using my word, that I think something like that would make a lot of sense.

511
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Or maybe it was where it was somebody sweet talking somebody, some sort of employee who didn't know better at one of these journalist's place that isn't gaming.

512
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Does that make sense?

513
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Yeah.

514
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Like sweet talking somebody who maybe like they get a switch, but their main dig isn't really games.

515
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Like I don't know if that makes sense, but maybe it was a way that these guys sweet talked it or flat out stole it potentially, I mean potentially, or whatever you want to believe here.

516
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
I've seen situations I don't-

517
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Which is why Nintendo would be able to recall it back so easily.

518
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Well they could track it probably by the serial number if they were showing like the internal screens and stuff like that, they may be able to pull a serial number from that.

519
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:08,000
But I would think that the other one I've seen too is like it was somebody's child that was like putting up the videos or something like that, not necessarily like a teenager or something like that.

520
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Because I remember something happened like that I want to see with like the Xbox 360 or-

521
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Yeah, or that's even happened with, okay, remember there was this really controversial case.

522
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:24,000
There was this older actor, and I don't remember the guy's name, but I think he played a lot of like mobster type characters in movies.

523
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:36,000
And he leaked a bunch of Oscar screeners, and that's how like Pirate Bay and some of those websites were getting copies of movies that were crystal clear quality while these things were still in theaters.

524
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:44,000
And this guy ended up getting kicked out of the Motion Picture Society or whoever it is that does the voting in the Oscars.

525
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:54,000
This guy was kicked out of it and he didn't even really, like this guy was an older guy who probably had no idea, who probably thought he was loaning these to his kid to watch the movie.

526
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Because I think a lot of people that get video screeners loan them to friends to watch, right, Loki?

527
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
I'm guilty of that, yes, absolutely.

528
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
So, but you didn't rip them and put them on the internet, so you-

529
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
No, that's work. I don't want to do work.

530
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Yeah, you weren't at risk like this other poor guy. Do you guys remember that? Like, I'm not crazy, right? That happened, right?

531
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:18,000
So maybe you've got something like that. I would believe that a heck of a lot more than I do. Nintendo did it for viral marketing.

532
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Okay, well maybe, okay, yeah, maybe that's a little stretch, but I find it hard to believe, though, that the source from this was a U.S. distributor.

533
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Because that would be just like unheard of that, oh hey, all of a sudden we decided that, oh, we do trust you guys and we're going to go ahead and do this.

534
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Fuck that. They don't trust anybody at all because there's no way to hold them accountable for that stuff.

535
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:41,000
And we would again do take away the three units that they're going to get as a whole. I mean, it's just not going to happen.

536
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Kaijuto in chat says, that guy was named Al Pacino. No, it was not Al Pacino. It was somebody else. It was not, it was not, like, I think it was one of those people like, you know, there's these people in movies.

537
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:55,000
You don't know their names, but you know their face. And you're like, it's that guy.

538
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:03,000
It's like when my good friend Billy and I went to see some movie and he gasped in the middle of it and went, she shot Selena.

539
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Because it was the actress who played the crazed fan club member in the Selena movie. Like, there's always that face, right, that you recognize in movies.

540
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Okay? Joe Pesci is another one of these guys, right? Even though we know his name.

541
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Anyways, so aside from that, yeah, they were showing off, you know, with this league now that we've kind of gone past that.

542
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:32,000
There's been YouTube videos that have gone up showing the Switch's menu system, storage specs, the UI, that type of stuff.

543
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:37,000
And apparently the internal storage is 25.9 gigabytes, at least that's what's usable from that.

544
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Some other stuff, of course, they're saying that apparently the eShop purchases are going to be tied to an online account on the Switch.

545
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Which makes me wonder, I thought that was the case with the Wii U and the 3DS. So you're saying that's not the case?

546
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:56,000
So I can't transfer my shit that I've basically been purchasing all digital on the Wii U to the Switch when I eventually get it?

547
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Thanks, Nintendo. I appreciate your forward thinking and network design.

548
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Yeah, so that's interesting, but I just, I'm very skeptical.

549
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Clever username here in chat says, the menus looked very barren. I'm not sure what I expected to be there, but there wasn't much.

550
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:25,000
This is not going to be final either, right? There's going to be a day one update. There has to be.

551
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Probably. There's going to be a day one patch, probably.

552
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:34,000
And it could be major. The Wii U's, if I remember right, the Wii U got a major day one patch.

553
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Yeah, I remember that because everyone complained that they had to wait a long time to be able to play anything on it.

554
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Be ready on Friday, you guys. You might not get into Zelda right away.

555
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Just don't connect your system to the network, maybe.

556
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:54,000
If you want to play that bad. I kind of think you should connect and just get the current stuff because it'll be guaranteed.

557
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Because for all we know, Zelda could crash on the other, you know, you should probably update it.

558
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:07,000
But anyway, I don't know. This is complicated because there definitely is a part of me, like I certainly don't want to say Nintendo had it coming or Nintendo deserved it or anything like that.

559
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Because the stolen shit is not cool. Like, that's not cool.

560
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:18,000
But I, you know, okay, this was inevitable. It was going to leak once the press kits get out.

561
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:23,000
You know, now that we know the press kits are out, because didn't Kotaku or one of those sites like flat out confirm they have a press kit?

562
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Yeah, I think one of them did. Somebody was tweeting and I know that.

563
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:31,000
So we know the press kits are out. So this information was going to get out eventually in one way or another.

564
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Again, I'm not endorsing the stolen shit. That's not cool.

565
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:44,000
But Nintendo could fix a lot of this by answering some very basic questions about what is planned for the launch of the Switch.

566
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Or producing one of these videos themselves or doing a direct that's an unboxing where they can control the conversation.

567
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,000
And it really blows my fucking mind that Nintendo hasn't done it yet.

568
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Two weeks away from launch.

569
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:04,000
I know. Here's the reality. I still have my Switch on pre-order. I'm excited to play it. That's not going to change.

570
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:11,000
But what I've told myself is you need to set the bar very low for this system the first day.

571
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Because this is looking more and more what the reality is, is Nintendo is doing the real launch of this system for the holiday.

572
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:26,000
And this is the soft launch to try to sell some copies to the diehard fans so they can bump up the numbers a little bit this fiscal year, which is fine.

573
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:33,000
But what I mean with that is that I am not going to expect Virtual Console is there day one. I don't think it's going to be there.

574
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:41,000
At this point, they have not answered the questions and I think they don't want the conversation to be about how Virtual Console is missing.

575
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
So my assumption is it's not there.

576
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:49,000
And okay, I don't see how we go years and years without there ever being Virtual Console.

577
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,000
And if I remember right, Wii U didn't have Virtual Console at first either.

578
00:51:53,000 --> 00:52:01,000
They brought that in later with the whole 30th birthday of something and they sold the balloon fight for 30 cents.

579
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
That was like the first Virtual Console game, right?

580
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:11,000
I don't think Virtual Console existed before that. I could be wrong, but even if I'm right or wrong, it doesn't matter.

581
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:15,000
The reality is the Wii U is probably not going to have Virtual Console the first day.

582
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,000
That's what I'm preparing myself for. In fact, it's probably not going to have a lot the first day.

583
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:26,000
It may not even have the online play ready to go the first day because do any of the launch titles need it?

584
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
No, I don't think any have online play.

585
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,000
So I'm prepared that there's no online whatsoever the first day.

586
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Well, they're probably going to need to figure out something because they've got that stupid beta test for Splatoon, so something's got to...

587
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Well, they've got a good three weeks to figure that out.

588
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Again, I don't think Nintendo is completely pulling it out their ass.

589
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:51,000
They have a roadmap, but I do think that roadmap works right up until the very last minute.

590
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Yeah, they probably shouldn't be putting the tires on the car while the car is starting the roll, you know what I mean?

591
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:04,000
YYR in chat says, yes Rob, that was right. Virtual Console on Wii U launched with 30 cent titles once a month for I think eight months.

592
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Yep, that's right. Let's see.

593
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:13,000
YYR says, I think folks who preordered Switch are going to be bored by day seven or they're going to be cheerleaders for the system, one or the other.

594
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Now on the flip side of that, Doom Plague says, I will take more than seven days to finish Zelda for most people.

595
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:27,000
And here's where Nintendo should be thanking BioWare for plopping a Mass Effect game out three weeks after the launch of the Switch,

596
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,000
because I'll be able to just overlook the...

597
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:35,000
But at the same time, my Switch probably will not be played while I'm focusing on Mass Effect Andromeda.

598
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:39,000
In my mind, I have like, what, three weeks to beat that Zelda game before Andromeda's out.

599
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,000
It would have been ideal if that was a launch title for the Switch. Too bad it can't run it.

600
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:54,000
But anyway, so my point is, I'm setting the bar very, very, very low for what the Switch is going to be able to do on day one.

601
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:59,000
And I really don't think we're going to be able to accurately judge this system until mid-November.

602
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:03,000
I think when they really go into overdrive to sell systems, it's going to be holiday.

603
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:08,000
And I think holiday will be when they inevitably bundle one, two Switch with the system.

604
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Oh, fuck that. No, fuck that.

605
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Mark, I'm telling you, it's what's going to happen. There will be a holiday bundle, and they'll include one, two Switch.

606
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
I don't want that fucking garbage.

607
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Like we're saying they should have done now.

608
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
That game is fucking shit.

609
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Then sell it back to whatever company.

610
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
No, it's garbage. Fuck that.

611
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,000
But you haven't played it yet. In a party situation.

612
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:35,000
You know what? I can look at a piece of shit on the ground and know what that probably smells like without actually going up to it.

613
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:45,000
So you're saying you don't get fun when you play Mario Party in a big group, or Wii Sports even in a fun group, or shit, even Nintendo Land with a group of people. It was no fun whatsoever.

614
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Dude, have you seen one, two Switch?

615
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
I have.

616
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Tech demo fucking city here. There is no game.

617
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Let me put it this way. I don't plan on buying it. And I do think it was a mistake for them not to bundle it in.

618
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:02,000
But I'm not going to completely trash it when I haven't played it myself yet.

619
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:15,000
I'm going to put it this way. The fucking games that they had bundled in with the PlayStation VR, like the free playroom stuff, is more robust than this fucking one, two Switch shit.

620
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
And that was free.

621
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Alright.

622
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:23,000
I'm not... $50? I mean are they fucking out of their mind?

623
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:27,000
I think some of these launch titles and what they're charging for are...

624
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:37,000
You know what it is? It's because it's like, after you get done with Zelda, and let's say that there's like 100 hours worth of gameplay there, okay?

625
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:41,000
So after a month you get done with Zelda or whatever, and Mario Kart's still not out yet.

626
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,000
It's like, well shit, I need to buy some other games for the Switch here.

627
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Fine, I'll try one, two Switch I guess because, you know, it could be fun. It's a party thing. That's how they're selling it. It's because there's nothing else.

628
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Come on Noel Gustin, our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says $20 says that Sky buys one, two Switch before April.

629
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,000
You're on with that bet, because that's not going to happen.

630
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:12,000
And when I get the $20, I'll be able to buy it out of a bargain bin during the holiday season.

631
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Ha! That's hilarious that you assume that Nintendo actually drops the price of their games ever, even if they do suck.

632
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
That's hilarious.

633
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
They do like three years after the fact.

634
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:29,000
No they don't. They never drop their prices of their games because they're Nintendo and we're quality and we're going to keep those fucking prices up. No.

635
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Well, we're less than two weeks away from the launch of the Switch now, and I think the reality is what you saw in this leaked video is all you're going to get until whenever the press embargo is up.

636
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Do we know what day the press gets to talk about their hands on with the Switch? Do we know what day that is?

637
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Nope.

638
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:51,000
That's not out there. So that could be the day of, or it could be the day before, or it could be, who knows, up to a week before.

639
00:56:51,000 --> 00:57:04,000
But we'll get a lot of chatter, I'm sure, from the press because they're not going to stay quiet on what they see inside the shell system and all that stuff and what they are and aren't seeing with whatever press patches Nintendo might be doing.

640
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Because Nintendo could still push a patch before the embargo is up so the press has to play catch up a little bit. That could still happen. We'll see.

641
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:24,000
All right. Anyhow, let's move on. We've got to move on to other stories and, you know, because eventually we want to get your phone calls and see what you think about all this stuff at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word, on Skype.

642
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:35,000
But one of the other titles for the Nintendo Switch, which is Ultra Street Fighter II, which is kind of, you know, the definitive, I suppose, Street Fighter II version that they're doing.

643
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:48,000
We were wondering why in this trailer for Ultra Street Fighter II was there suddenly this weird first person mode where you could see Ryu throwing a fireball all of a sudden.

644
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Like, was this just something they put together for the trailer? Was it a cinematic? Was it like a Street Fighter IV thing? What the hell was it?

645
00:57:54,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Well, it turns out that, yeah, this is actually some new mode that's in this game. In an episode of Capcom TV, they showcased this new mode called Way of the Hadu, which looks like, I guess it's supposed to be like one of those arcade shooter things, like House of the Dead type of things.

646
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:25,000
So you actually are going through on rails and shooting fireballs at things. You fling your little Joy-Con controller to do the fireball and you uppercut and spin kick the Shadaloo Grunts.

647
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:29,000
So it's a silly extra party mode thing.

648
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Are we really doing this now? Is Nintendo forcing Waggle on people again?

649
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Do you know what this says to me? Do you know what this screams to me? Do you remember in Star Wars Connect how they had the dance mode, because it had to have a dance mode to show off the connect? That's what this is kind of screaming to me.

650
00:58:47,000 --> 00:59:03,000
This system is the fucking Wii U again. Literally up to the very last title coming out on this thing. It's like, honestly, the second screen thing is, it's worth it. This is important. This is why we put out the console, because it has tilt controls and stuff.

651
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:16,000
They're still fucking trying to convince you why tilt controls are fucking necessary. It's not necessary in Street Fighter. Yeah, it's a neat little extra thing to throw in there, but oh my god, it's completely unnecessary.

652
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Bob Coffee in chat says the Wii U never got Street Fighter though, lol. It didn't even get Street Fighter IV. No, I guess it didn't, did it? I'm thinking 3DS.

653
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:35,000
You can't run Street Fighter IV. No, the 3DS can run Street Fighter IV, come on. They could do Street Fighter IV on the Wii U. But yeah, I guess they didn't really have a version of Street Fighter there.

654
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Anyway, this is just one of those like, okay, cool story, but it's not something that is gonna sell me a copy of this game, that's for sure.

655
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:49,000
And what I hope they're not trying to do is justify why they're gonna charge 40 bucks for this. Do we know how much they're charging for old Street Fighter II?

656
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:58,000
The game that was $20 on Xbox Live, not that long ago? Because if they're trying to use this to justify 40 bucks, nice try.

657
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:06,000
I'll be picking this up out of the bargain bin when I get my $20 reward for that bet from earlier.

658
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Let's see. I mean, don't get me wrong, I love Street Fighter II, and I like what the Switch as a platform can do for that with multiplayer.

659
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Yeah, the retail version of the game is gonna be priced at 4990 yen, which is around $43. A digital edition is gonna launch at 4620 yen, or $40. It's a $40 game.

660
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:33,000
So it's a $40 game. No thanks. No. Not happening.

661
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Yeah, this is, there's, see, here's the thing. A lot of you might say that we keep shitting on Nintendo, but the problem is there's just all these like, uh-oh things that are going on.

662
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,000
It is a fucking cash grab. That is a fucking cash grab.

663
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Uh-oh.

664
01:00:51,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Don't get me wrong, Street Fighter II is fun and all, but are we really selling a $40 Street Fighter II game, what, like decades after Street Fighter II was a big thing?

665
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:07,000
I mean, shit, put, I'll tell you what, just put Street Fighter II out in virtual, oh, that's right, virtual consoles, I could be there at launch.

666
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,000
My mistake, how, why would I even think that that would be a thing?

667
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,000
You're such an ass.

668
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
But no, seriously though, just wait.

669
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:23,000
No, I get it. I get it. It's, it's one of those things where, you know, again, I think Ultra Street Fighter II's biggest perk is what the Switch is as a platform.

670
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:30,000
It's the whole reason why, you know, despite this negative talk right now, there are still things I do get excited about with the Switch.

671
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:45,000
And I've said this before on the show, but it's Mario Kart 8 when I'm going to be able to just take my system to the next convention and we all can sit there in a hotel room and we all play Mario Kart 8 on our, like, little screens like we were playing it at home or whatever.

672
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Like, that's going to be badass.

673
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:52,000
So they're selling you on potential. Okay, well, I hope that's how it actually turns out. I'm just...

674
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:57,000
I have no reason to believe it wouldn't, considering this is the whole crux of what the system is supposed to be.

675
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Okay, well, I hope it's worth how many other conventions you go to a year.

676
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
We'll see. I think so.

677
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:08,000
That's a lot to drop on a system for a game that you could play on a system you already have.

678
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,000
I'm not saying necessarily...

679
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
For the potential that, you know...

680
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
It's not going to be limited to those two games, you know it.

681
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:20,000
I just... I hope the system doesn't die out before they actually get those games out.

682
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
ActDeftInChat says Splatoon 2.

683
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Of course, this system is not going to die out before they...

684
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,000
They're going to get the Mario game out this holiday, but I do...

685
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:31,000
I do think the holiday is going to be very much a make or break thing for Nintendo.

686
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Like, if Nintendo does not impress people with the holiday sales figures, it's going to be bad.

687
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Nintendo may have to fall back on the 3DS, and that's that.

688
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Nintendo may not... And the mobile development, and that may be...

689
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:49,000
That may be it for consoles from Nintendo, which is a crazy thing to be saying, I know.

690
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
They need to put out a fucking console that's spec...

691
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
They need to put one out that's spec-wise.

692
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Do... Pull a fucking GameCube.

693
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Put a console out that's spec, you know, comparable to other consoles,

694
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,000
and then you're not going to have a problem with third-party support,

695
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,000
and you can still put out games that are fucking nice.

696
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Stop relying on fucking gimmicks.

697
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
DoomPlagueInChat says,

698
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,000
The software lineup in the first year will be light, like, you know, every other console,

699
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,000
but every other console launched in November,

700
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
where you could kind of get away with that a little differently.

701
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
And there'd be third-party support, too, like...

702
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
And also, I do want to be fair,

703
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
because there's these graphics floating around out there

704
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
that show you what is going to be out in the first year,

705
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:30,000
and to be fair, there are a lot of games that are coming out in this first year.

706
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,000
My concern is that many of them already exist onto their platforms,

707
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:37,000
and it didn't work for the Wii U, and I don't know why it's going to work here,

708
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:41,000
unless the portability aspect is that big of a seller,

709
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,000
which for a multiplayer experience, I personally think it will be.

710
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,000
For something like Skyrim, I don't think it will be.

711
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
But that's my opinion,

712
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:55,000
and ultimately it will be the sales of those that want that

713
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
that are going to really drive this conversation.

714
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,000
I just hope it's not a $60 game by the time it comes out,

715
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
because that's ridiculous at that point.

716
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,000
We'll see what happens. Anyway, I do want to move on.

717
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:08,000
We've got other stuff to talk about as well that happened this week.

718
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Not just Switch stuff, right, Loki?

719
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,000
No, and speaking of Skyrim, actually,

720
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:17,000
there's been an update to Skyrim, which adds some limitations.

721
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Now, I don't think these limitations are necessarily a bad thing,

722
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:26,000
because I don't really see where you'd be running this many mods at one time,

723
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:31,000
but they have a limit now on Fallout 4 and Skyrim.

724
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:37,000
On the Xbox One, you're only going to be able to have 150 mods active at one time.

725
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:43,000
You can install more mods, but you can only have 150 max enabled at one time.

726
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
PlayStation 4, you can only have 100.

727
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Honestly, when I was running with mods, I maybe had 8 or 10.

728
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
You're not going to...

729
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
150 is a lot.

730
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
You're not going to...

731
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Unless you're Alan. Then that's just normal.

732
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Well, don't get me wrong. On PC, there's a lot of visual graphic improvement mods you can do,

733
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,000
but on PlayStation 4, it's all fucking stats and shit,

734
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,000
and I can't honestly see where you would even run that many.

735
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Even on PC, I think running that many, that's pretty taxing.

736
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:16,000
That's just asking for trouble, because stuff conflicts with other things.

737
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:22,000
You need to re-evaluate your life if you're running 100 mods on Skyrim on console.

738
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,000
I mean, seriously.

739
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:30,000
There weren't even 100 in there that looked like I wanted to install.

740
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Exactly. I think that's fine, but I can see why they're doing that,

741
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:38,000
because I would just crash that game like shit.

742
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
I mean, I don't know.

743
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,000
You know, I didn't mention this during my gaming weekend.

744
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,000
It's important.

745
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Kaishido in chat says,

746
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:48,000
I can anything from Bethesda up late.

747
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
They never patch shit on time.

748
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Yeah, you know, I got to say, there's still some bugs in Skyrim Special Edition.

749
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,000
There's quite a bit of bugs in Skyrim.

750
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:00,000
That are kind of a little ridiculous with how old this game is now, right?

751
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
And isn't there actually one of the biggest mods?

752
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,000
I think the most popular mod on Xbox One right now is like,

753
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:08,000
this is the Skyrim update that Bethesda won't do.

754
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Yeah, the unofficial patch.

755
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Yeah, the unofficial patch.

756
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,000
It's like the number one thing.

757
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,000
And I can't install it, because it's going to bork the achievements thing,

758
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,000
which I would like to just for fun try to get some of those.

759
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:20,000
I don't think I'm going to put the pedal to the metal, try to get them all.

760
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,000
I'll probably install mods before then,

761
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:25,000
but it's a little silly that the fan community has to fix it.

762
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
That is one of the pluses of the PC community,

763
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:31,000
where you can just do that and there's nothing they can do about it.

764
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Unless, of course, you use their official routes to modding the game.

765
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Alright, let's see.

766
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Moving on to another story.

767
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,000
I guess this one's also about the Switch,

768
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:44,000
but it's about another event that's also happening this weekend.

769
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:48,000
So Final Fantasy XIV, which is an MMO that I play a lot of,

770
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:53,000
they're having their Fan Fest, which I went to in Vegas last year.

771
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
I went in October.

772
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:58,000
But they're actually having their Fan Fest in Europe right now.

773
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,000
And this is kind of the end of the three Fan Fests

774
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:05,000
that are leading up to the launch of Stormblood in June, the next expansion.

775
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:10,000
And so they actually announced that the next playable class is going to be Samurai,

776
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
was something that they announced at Fan Fest.

777
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:16,000
But they were doing some Q&A and all this stuff at the European Fan Fest.

778
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:21,000
And one of the questions that the producer got asked of Final Fantasy XIV was,

779
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:26,000
would you consider bringing Final Fantasy XIV to the Nintendo Switch?

780
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
And the answer that Yoshida gave was,

781
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:34,000
in order for it to come to the system, cross-platform play would need to be supported.

782
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Yoshida naturally wants the polished title on as many systems as possible.

783
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:44,000
And this has always been his reasoning for why it's not on Xbox One,

784
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,000
is that he'll be happy to put the game on Xbox One,

785
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:50,000
but Microsoft has to allow cross-platform.

786
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,000
You will be able to play the game.

787
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Which I thought they were.

788
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Well, I thought they were now, too.

789
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
I'm a little surprised that none of these Fan Fests...

790
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,000
I think it has to be in PlayStation. PlayStation has to also allow...

791
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Well, they do, but...

792
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,000
I think they do.

793
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
I don't know. I don't know how that works.

794
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
I thought it wasn't...

795
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Rocket League was supposed to be moving that direction, weren't they?

796
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Where you could play cross-platform on all that stuff.

797
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:15,000
So, I mean, yeah, I think Microsoft and Sony are both realizing these policies do them more harm than good.

798
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:19,000
So, especially when Microsoft was just fine with Final Fantasy XI,

799
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:22,000
back when they needed strength on the Xbox 360.

800
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:26,000
So, I'm really surprised that Final Fantasy XIV has not been announced,

801
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
or at least Stormblood, for the Xbox One.

802
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:32,000
But all that stuff aside, let's talk about the Nintendo Switch for a minute.

803
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:36,000
You know, the whole fact that you could take it out portable,

804
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,000
as long as you had a Wi-Fi connection, because it is an online game after all,

805
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:42,000
is kind of neat, but at the same time...

806
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,000
And Final Fantasy XIV does play very well on a controller.

807
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Like, you can do it very easily on PlayStation 4.

808
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
But at the same time, here's what I worry about.

809
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:56,000
A lot of folks were very happy to hear that Final Fantasy XIV is going to be ending PlayStation 3 support.

810
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:02,000
And the reason for that is, is that now they can push Final Fantasy XIV even further,

811
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:08,000
graphically and all this other stuff that they wouldn't be able to do on the PlayStation 3 because of the limitations.

812
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:15,000
As far as I know, a Switch is more powerful than PlayStation 3, but it's not as powerful as PlayStation 4.

813
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:20,000
So if the Switch is now going to be the lowest common denominator that holds the game back,

814
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
I don't want to see it released on the Switch.

815
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,000
I don't want to see the game move further.

816
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Now, if I'm wrong, and they are perfectly capable of releasing the game on Switch,

817
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
without having to make any concessions to what...

818
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:38,000
You know, if the Switch is just powerful enough to do what they need the game to do,

819
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
then fine, cool, put it on the Switch.

820
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
But I just don't want the Switch to become the new PlayStation 3.

821
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Does that make sense?

822
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Yeah, that makes sense.

823
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:48,000
So, I don't think the whole portableness and all that stuff is worth it.

824
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:54,000
I don't think you have to talk about Nintendo has to be willing to be cross-play with Sony and Microsoft.

825
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Like, I kind of just don't see that happening at all.

826
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,000
No, they don't know how to do that. That's not going to happen.

827
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Well, it would be through Square Enix's servers. That's how they do it.

828
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,000
It's not, it's...

829
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Because, you know, again, we can sit here and say, Nintendo doesn't know how to do it,

830
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:12,000
but remember, Phantasy Star Online was awesome on the GameCube.

831
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:16,000
No, but too bad it was the one fucking GameCube game that ever used that adapter

832
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:19,000
to let you get on the internet with it.

833
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:24,000
So, I mean, I have no reason to believe that Nintendo is not capable of doing these things.

834
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Will it do these things?

835
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,000
And also, I don't know if it would really...

836
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:32,000
I mean, it would be fun to be able to play it, like, I guess, portably,

837
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:36,000
but you're right, you need to have, like, a good Wi-Fi connection to do that.

838
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:41,000
So, how feasible would it really be to, I mean, just get a laptop at that point?

839
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
I mean, seriously.

840
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:47,000
Well, I'm all for more people getting exposed to this game through new consoles,

841
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:52,000
but, you know, again, just as long as it's not going to hold it back for everybody else,

842
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
we'll see what happens with the Switch.

843
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,000
They did, though, I'll briefly mention this before we go on to Loki's next story.

844
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:01,000
They did tease a little bit about the PlayStation 4 Pro,

845
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,000
and it sounds like they are going to be doing a Pro patch for PlayStation.

846
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Even without the Pro patch, though, that little beta thing that they've got,

847
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:12,000
like, whatever they call that, the overclocking or whatever it does,

848
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,000
it apparently makes it run much nicer.

849
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Yeah, yeah. I'm excited to see what they do for a play.

850
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,000
I guess one of those things where it's not a super high priority for them,

851
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,000
but they are realizing that they can make PlayStation 4 Pro

852
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,000
be able to display more things, you know, with the added RAM and all that stuff.

853
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
So, they're talking about that.

854
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:32,000
So, I'm curious, because I do own the game on PlayStation 4,

855
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
although I probably won't get Stormblood on PlayStation 4,

856
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
because, okay, double dipping is a little much,

857
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,000
but that's one of those things where inevitably on Black Friday,

858
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:42,000
it will go on sale very cheap, and then I'll buy it and catch up that way,

859
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,000
and be able to play on the TV and PC.

860
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Cool.

861
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Because I'm a nerd.

862
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,000
All right, let's move on. Loki.

863
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:51,000
One of the other games I was actually thinking about today,

864
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:54,000
I should really go back and play, Watch Dogs 2 is getting some DLC.

865
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:57,000
So, this new piece of DLC is called Human Conditions,

866
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:00,000
and it revolves around self-driving cars.

867
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,000
So, basically, the premise is the company,

868
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,000
the Google equivalent in this game, Noodle,

869
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:11,000
has these self-driving cars that assign values to people's lives.

870
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
So, in the case of an accident,

871
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:18,000
the car will prioritize the safety of whomever it deems to be worth more.

872
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:24,000
And so, of course, there's a lot of morality questions regarding that.

873
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:29,000
So, of course, they're going to be hacking Noodle to stop this.

874
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,000
The other thing, of course,

875
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:34,000
there's some other missions that involve ransomware machines

876
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
and barrier hospitals.

877
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:43,000
So, that should be coming out, actually, next week on PlayStation 4.

878
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Yeah, it's on the 21st, and PlayStation 4 and PC and Xbox One are March 23rd.

879
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:57,000
And then, also, the ending has been edited as well.

880
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:01,000
So, there's a new update that extends the ending to the game,

881
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:06,000
which says that there may be a hint at the location for Watch Dogs 3,

882
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
or a possible expansion to the game.

883
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:12,000
So, apparently, at the end of the game, spoiler, I guess,

884
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:15,000
there is a WAV file, which the title,

885
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:19,000
which parents to be coordinates pointing to London.

886
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:26,000
So, perhaps London will be the next location of Watch Dogs 3.

887
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,000
So, we'll have to see.

888
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,000
But, yeah, I should go back and play that game,

889
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
because it's actually pretty cool.

890
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,000
All right.

891
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Yeah, I think, especially because Watch Dogs 2 has been getting more,

892
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
you know, it's been getting better reviews even than the first one.

893
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
I don't see why they won't do a third game.

894
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:45,000
I guess it's sales at the end of the day.

895
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Yeah, I do need to go back and play it there,

896
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
because that was a pretty good game.

897
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
All right.

898
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Let's move on and talk a little bit about,

899
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:56,000
oh, this is another, god, I hate to keep going back to the Switch.

900
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,000
I actually don't think this is as bad as everyone's making it out to be.

901
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
I'm curious to see where Loki's going to be on the fence with this.

902
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,000
But it was announced this week that one of the big games

903
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
that's going to be on the Switch, well, on the Wii U as well, really,

904
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
is, of course, Zelda Breath of the Wild.

905
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:15,000
And they are going to be doing a $20 season pass for the game

906
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
that will go on sale on March 3rd.

907
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:20,000
There's a whole YouTube that Eiji Aonuma did

908
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:24,000
to talk about how Hyrule will be better because of this expansion pack

909
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
that they're going to be doing.

910
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
There's going to be two release dates for this.

911
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
There's going to be a summer expansion,

912
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
and there's going to be a winter expansion.

913
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,000
But with this expansion pack, you'll be able to get new chests

914
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:38,000
and clothing in Breath of the Wild right from the start.

915
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Once the DLC hits in the summer, you're going to get the Cave of Trials

916
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:44,000
in a harder difficulty setting and an additional map feature.

917
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:48,000
And then in the winter, there's going to be a new, I guess, side story,

918
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:52,000
and another new dungeon and additional challenges in the game.

919
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:55,000
But there's a lot of people that are kind of going,

920
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,000
ah, fuck, Zelda's going DLC.

921
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Here goes Nintendo down this season pass route.

922
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
I definitely have an opinion on this.

923
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
I'm curious where you're at, though, Loki.

924
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,000
I've got to ask.

925
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,000
It just has to be worthwhile, I mean, what the content is.

926
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
I don't know what it is.

927
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
So, I mean, they mention a little bonus chest.

928
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
I think that's stupid.

929
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
I mean, that's kind of unnecessary.

930
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:20,000
You want to see how meaty this cave, what is this, the Cave of Trials

931
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,000
and all this stuff is.

932
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Yeah, I think it sounds really short, just based on the whole side story

933
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:28,000
and stuff, but this doesn't seem like worthwhile content.

934
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Whereas Mario Kart, that was pretty cool because they actually had

935
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
some good tracks and new characters and stuff,

936
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:36,000
and that was definitely more substantial as far as this.

937
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
And I didn't have a problem with the season pass on that.

938
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Zelda almost feels like they're just throwing it in there because they can.

939
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Well, I think, though, Loki, because, and you pointed out,

940
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:48,000
because a Mario Kart 8 is kind of like a proven track record for them,

941
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt.

942
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,000
And I think Nintendo, you know, as strange as it is,

943
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
they seem to do DLC.

944
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
They're one of the best at DLC right now.

945
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Like, their DLC that they do is really good.

946
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:02,000
You know, they had it us all in the Mario Brothers 2, Golden Coins.

947
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:05,000
A lot of these other games that Nintendo's done their own DLC for

948
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
have actually been pretty kick-ass.

949
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,000
So I'm okay with this.

950
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:11,000
I'm completely okay with this, and I'll probably even buy it

951
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:17,000
because I'm sure these things are going to be like the Mario Kart 8 DLC.

952
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:20,000
If I'm wrong, then I won't make that mistake again in the future,

953
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:24,000
but right now I feel a little better about this

954
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,000
than I even do kind of where Final Fantasy XV's been going,

955
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:31,000
and I'm starting to have a little bit of buyer's remorse on that season pack for XV.

956
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Yeah, XV. Yeah, that's a little weird.

957
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
I didn't care for that carnival thing they put in.

958
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:38,000
I thought it was just a little, I thought I was kind of silly myself.

959
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:43,000
I'm hopeful the Gladio story will be good,

960
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:46,000
and I know where that's going to fit in into the main story.

961
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:50,000
It's very obvious where all, there is very, very, very obvious

962
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
if you play through Final Fantasy XV

963
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:55,000
where each and every one of those side stories fit into the main game.

964
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:58,000
So I'm curious to do the Gladio thing and play that through.

965
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:03,000
I just, I hope it's better than the stuff we're seeing so far,

966
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:07,000
which is free, so it's okay if the carnival is not that great

967
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
because it was free, so fine.

968
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Free is free.

969
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:13,000
But I'll be curious about this other stuff.

970
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:16,000
So, let's see, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says,

971
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:20,000
I literally just got to that part of the main story last night about Gladio.

972
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Yeah, so let's, hey, take your time.

973
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:27,000
If you keep going that slowly, then you won't ever have to play the chapter 13

974
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,000
that I played, and that's probably not a bad thing.

975
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
And I've actually been holding off on playing the game

976
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
because of all this DLC stuff.

977
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
I kind of want to play the full game when it comes out

978
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
and not have to go back and play all this shit,

979
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:42,000
so I'm waiting to do all that.

980
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:47,000
Akdeft points out, Mario Kart 8, Smash, and Hyrule Warriors have great DLC.

981
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Let's see, Orangewrite says Mario Kart season pass was good.

982
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:53,000
Only season pass I ever bought, though.

983
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Smash is a little expensive.

984
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Smash did get expensive, but I also understand the need for licensing,

985
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:02,000
especially with things like Cloud and Bayonetta and Ryu and all this stuff,

986
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
so it's like, okay.

987
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Then don't put those characters in there.

988
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Are you kidding? Absolutely put those characters in there.

989
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
They're a lot of fun.

990
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
So they cost a little premium. Big deal.

991
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
No, bullshit. You shouldn't have to pay for licensing fees

992
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
if you have your own fucking library full of characters

993
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
that you could be putting in there.

994
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
I agree and I don't agree.

995
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
I think in order to get some of those extra characters,

996
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
if they have to cost a dollar or two more, fine.

997
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,000
I'm fine with it.

998
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Getting to be able to play with Cloud and Smash is awesome.

999
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
They couldn't put Snake back in there?

1000
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Well, a licensing thing.

1001
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Do you think anybody at Konami was functioning

1002
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
when this game was being made?

1003
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
It was a different story back when the last game was being made.

1004
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
It's different now.

1005
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Anyhow, all right.

1006
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Let's move on to some more stories.

1007
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Loki, something that's not the Switch.

1008
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Some good news from Nintendo that's not the Switch,

1009
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
or Nintendo adjacent.

1010
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:54,000
The expansion finally came out,

1011
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:58,000
so now you can get those Johto Pokémon.

1012
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
So they added 80 new Pokémon to the game,

1013
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,000
including some new berries you can get as well,

1014
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:07,000
and then some new items on top of that.

1015
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Evolution items.

1016
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
And then the berries.

1017
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
There's a pineapple berry that looks like a pineapple,

1018
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:16,000
and it will not quite double the candy,

1019
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
but it gives you more candy.

1020
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,000
I caught a Cyndaquil spawn in the house today.

1021
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
I must live in a Cyndaquil nest now.

1022
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
And I caught it, and I used that berry,

1023
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
because, oh, if this is a starter Pokémon,

1024
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
I want to use those berries to get more candy,

1025
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
because starter Pokémon are not as common, usually.

1026
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Do they have new starter Pokémon now?

1027
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Well, no.

1028
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
If you start a new character,

1029
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,000
you still only get to pick from Bulbasaur, Squirtle,

1030
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
or you walk away from him and you get Pikachu.

1031
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
It's still that same way. They didn't change that.

1032
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:48,000
But they were the starters in Gen 2,

1033
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
so obviously Cyndaquil and Totodile,

1034
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,000
and those guys are still, you know...

1035
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Are you pulling up Pokémon Go to see if there's a Cyndaquil out right now?

1036
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,000
No, I see him. I see him once in a while.

1037
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
And then there's another berry.

1038
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:04,000
The other berry is like Valium for the Pokémon.

1039
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
It slows them down.

1040
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Yeah, because they have the new encounters now,

1041
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
so they move around quite a bit.

1042
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
Have you seen Abra?

1043
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Yeah, that's the one that flies into Figure 8 on the screen.

1044
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:19,000
I didn't find that stuff to be that bad, though.

1045
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:22,000
It's just another thing they do to fuck with you,

1046
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,000
besides the whole attacking in one place.

1047
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
So I thought that was, you know, whatever.

1048
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Can I just say, I am very tired of seeing these stupid Murkrows,

1049
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
because they don't evolve at all.

1050
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,000
They're everywhere.

1051
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,000
Yeah, they're fucking everywhere.

1052
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,000
They are.

1053
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,000
What are you catching right now?

1054
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
A Murkrow.

1055
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
But I'm fucking tired of seeing them,

1056
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:45,000
because I'm going to have one buffed up Murkrow at the end,

1057
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:48,000
because they're all over the place, but you can't evolve them.

1058
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:51,000
A Niantic, Nerf Blissey.

1059
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Oh my god, Blissey is unreal right now.

1060
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:56,000
You can't fight Blissey in a gym unless you have two people.

1061
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,000
What's Blissey?

1062
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:00,000
It's an evolved Chauncey that was in Gen 2.

1063
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:04,000
And I don't know, if you guys are like me,

1064
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:07,000
you got a shit ton of Chauncey candies during the Valentine's event,

1065
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:11,000
so you were able to evolve Blissey when Gen 2 went live, which I did.

1066
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:14,000
And it's cool that I have one, but everybody else has one too.

1067
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,000
And if they're on a gym, they have so many hit points,

1068
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:21,000
you can't take them out in the 99 second clock on the gym.

1069
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:24,000
So you have to have two people to do it to get the Blissey's hit points down in time.

1070
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
It sucks, because I don't think there's a...

1071
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Blissey is a normal type, so what would be effective against it?

1072
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Fighting type?

1073
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
I tried using a Machomp, or...

1074
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Is Machamp? No.

1075
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,000
God, I can't remember.

1076
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
Machoke is the fully evolved one, right?

1077
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:41,000
That's the one I tried to use against the best fighting type one I had,

1078
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
and it wasn't doing anything.

1079
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Maybe somebody in chat knows which one.

1080
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:49,000
You gotta use against Blissey, because that is...

1081
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
They're gonna have to balance that.

1082
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Some other things that they added too.

1083
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:56,000
They added new Avatar items, which cost money.

1084
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
So fuck them for that.

1085
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
They also added some new music.

1086
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Well, Loki, if you caught enough gyms, you can get the gold.

1087
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Get it that way.

1088
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
I'm not buying their shit. Fuck that.

1089
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:11,000
They even have a t-shirt, I think, that says 30 if you reach level 30.

1090
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
I'm assuming that's when that unlocks.

1091
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Yeah.

1092
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
But I don't care.

1093
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,000
Yeah, new music.

1094
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:22,000
So they have new music at night, and new music encounters at night as well.

1095
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
I suppose there's more of a variety of Pokémon,

1096
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:27,000
because honestly, I'm still running into the same few.

1097
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Oh god, are you gonna be one of those people that's already waiting for Gen 3?

1098
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
No, I'm not waiting for Gen 3.

1099
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:36,000
I'm waiting for those other Pokémon to come around.

1100
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
I did run into some different things,

1101
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:42,000
like I got Psyduck finally, and a Chansey, and all that.

1102
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
The nests are rebalancing too.

1103
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:48,000
I love the Silph Road props to the people that run that site,

1104
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
but there's an atlas thing on Silph Road,

1105
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
and it's all crowd sourced, basically.

1106
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
So you kind of note where the nests are in your neighborhood,

1107
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:58,000
and it's a great way to figure out where the Pokémon you want are.

1108
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:03,000
And so, yeah, now you can see how the Gen 2 are kind of in there as well.

1109
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:06,000
So it does make some of the Gen 1 harder to find,

1110
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:09,000
which is a bummer, because there's still things I need like Kabuto.

1111
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
I don't have a Kabutops.

1112
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
So I still need enough Kabuto to evolve that,

1113
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:16,000
and now the Kabuto are harder to find their nests,

1114
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:19,000
because there's Gen 2 nests that are available.

1115
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:23,000
But the good news is there are still at least some Kabuto nests out there.

1116
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
It's just I may have to drive a little further to find them,

1117
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:28,000
because they're not going to be as frequent.

1118
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
To register participation for this week's episode of

1119
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:37,000
Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, cup.

1120
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,000
There you go.

1121
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:41,000
But I think the game kind of needed a kick in the ass.

1122
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
A lot of people have been going around going,

1123
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Dead game, LOL.

1124
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,000
I've definitely seen a lot of activity.

1125
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
I work in downtown Sacramento now,

1126
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:51,000
and it's just fucking lit up.

1127
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:54,000
There's ridiculous amounts of lures on shit.

1128
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:57,000
I'm like, holy fuck, it's pouring rain outside.

1129
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:00,000
There's lures on every single lure down in Capitol Park and stuff.

1130
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,000
When they were lasting for six hours, that kind of helps too.

1131
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Well, no, it wasn't lasting for six.

1132
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
This is after that whole Valentine's Day thing is up.

1133
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Oh, really?

1134
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Unless they're still lasting for six hours.

1135
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:11,000
I thought the six hour thing was going to go on for two more days.

1136
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:15,000
Last time I saw, because I still have some in inventory,

1137
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
it still says they last for 30 minutes,

1138
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:20,000
unless they didn't update that verbiage.

1139
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
They probably didn't update the verbiage ever.

1140
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:25,000
And Act F points out the six hour thing ended today.

1141
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Okay, well then that's probably why there were so many.

1142
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:28,000
Yeah, that's probably why there were so many.

1143
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
But it'll be interesting to see what it looks like when you go back.

1144
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
I still do, even during 30 minutes,

1145
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:35,000
the time I see lures used is when people go to dinner,

1146
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:38,000
and there's a pokestop at dinner, and people will lure.

1147
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:41,000
Yeah, that's still getting used for that.

1148
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
And I'm sure will be, even with Gen 2.

1149
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:47,000
All right, well, we're going to take a step.

1150
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
Oh, and I hit 24 this week as well.

1151
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Congrats. I hit 28. Get on my level.

1152
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,000
I'm just kidding.

1153
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
But I did hit 28. I'm excited.

1154
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:58,000
All right, let's travel to a time when games were simpler.

1155
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Oops, that is not, that's a different theme song.

1156
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
How about this theme song?

1157
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
Yes, there you go.

1158
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
We're going to travel back to a simpler time,

1159
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:10,000
when you didn't have cell phones to play games.

1160
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,000
In fact, you didn't need much to play this game.

1161
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:17,000
It's time to get into the classic game of the week.

1162
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:21,000
And this is where usually Dark Sakura would step into the gaming vault

1163
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
and find a game that she thinks,

1164
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:26,000
hey, you brats should be playing this game this week.

1165
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:29,000
But Dark Sakura's not here tonight, so you know what that means.

1166
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:32,000
Halo. Just kidding. I don't want to die.

1167
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
We're going to pick a different game here for the classic game of the week.

1168
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:37,000
But I am going to pick this week's classic game of the week as my choice.

1169
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:41,000
And I have picked, I've gone way back for this one.

1170
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Way back, Loki. This is way back.

1171
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Let's picture a simpler time.

1172
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:50,000
How about the first release of this game in 1977?

1173
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:55,000
Or maybe the releases that I remember were a little more recent, 1980.

1174
01:25:55,000 --> 01:26:00,000
In fact, these games are so old, they don't have music in them.

1175
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:03,000
So I don't really have anything to play in the background.

1176
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:11,000
But this series ended up being so popular that it showed up in gaming again and again and again.

1177
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:17,000
And it even showed up in gaming, gosh, probably in the 90s during the CD-ROM era.

1178
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:23,000
And they did this epic introduction in one of the games that reimagined the very first game

1179
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:27,000
in this epic cinematic opening that says,

1180
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:33,000
You're standing behind the White House. In one corner is a small window, which is slightly ajar.

1181
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:36,000
That's right. Classic game of the week this week is Zork.

1182
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
That's what I've picked this week.

1183
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
I have some folks in the chatroom called it. Good job.

1184
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Zork is the classic game of the week this week, which is a text adventure-based game,

1185
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:48,000
or at least it was when it was first released.

1186
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:51,000
And I do want to state, even though I played a little clip there from Return to Zork,

1187
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:55,000
the classic game of the week is going to be the original Zork trilogy,

1188
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
or I guess Zork 1, if you will.

1189
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
That's the one I remember the most.

1190
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:02,000
But Zork, of course, was a text adventure-based game,

1191
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:05,000
so you had to read in order to be able to play this game.

1192
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
It wasn't something that had fancy graphics,

1193
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:11,000
because the original version of Zork was written in the late 70s.

1194
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
They used a programming language called MDL,

1195
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:18,000
and they used a computer that you don't even have in your home, the DEC PDP-10.

1196
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:23,000
It was written by four different authors, Tim Anderson, Mark Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling,

1197
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
and they were all out of MIT.

1198
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:28,000
They were part of the dynamic modeling group at MIT.

1199
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:32,000
So this game that they imagined ended up being published commercially by Infocom,

1200
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
and they did split it into three games.

1201
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:37,000
They had Zork, The Great Underground Empire, which was part one,

1202
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:41,000
Zork 2, The Wizard of Frobaz, and Zork 3, which was the Dungeon Master.

1203
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:45,000
And this was not the first text adventure game,

1204
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:48,000
but it took the text adventure games a little bit further

1205
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:51,000
because you could use more of the English language with it.

1206
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:54,000
Like, in early games, you might have been able to say, like,

1207
01:27:54,000 --> 01:28:02,000
hit monster, but Zork would allow you to say hit monster with the dagger.

1208
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Like, it would actually let you put together sentences in the game.

1209
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:10,000
So it was a little more powerful of a text adventure game.

1210
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:14,000
So anyway, Zork was set in the ruins of an ancient empire lying far underground.

1211
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
That was the opening line in Zork there.

1212
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:20,000
It was about the White House, the mailbox, and all that.

1213
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:23,000
So you actually go into the house, you go into the underground,

1214
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:26,000
and you hope that you don't get eaten by a grue,

1215
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
which was a very scary thing in the games,

1216
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
is that you might move into the rooms.

1217
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:35,000
If you're not properly lit, you will actually get eaten by a grue.

1218
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
And then you travel through the Great Underground Empire,

1219
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:40,000
and you look for treasures to complete the adventure.

1220
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:43,000
And this is a very hard game.

1221
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
I remember being a kid. I was not able to get very far in this.

1222
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:49,000
We did own Zork on the Commodore 64, and I do remember playing this game,

1223
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
and I always got eaten by the fucking grue.

1224
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:56,000
I never was able to really get past that until there were maps,

1225
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
there were strategy guides.

1226
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:02,000
I'm sure there was even the published way on how to get from start to finish

1227
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
as fast as possible.

1228
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
But it was a tough game.

1229
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Especially for people that were really into fantasy novels.

1230
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
The 70s was really a great...

1231
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
I mean, fantasy novels are still big today.

1232
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:18,000
But even in the 70s, when Dungeons & Dragons was still growing in popularity,

1233
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:21,000
and so forth, we didn't really have video games realizing a lot of that yet.

1234
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Zork presented a really cool little thing for fantasy novel fans

1235
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:30,000
to be able to do a choose-your-own-adventure type of novel,

1236
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:33,000
but on the next level, really.

1237
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:39,000
So anyhow, Zork, by the way, apparently there are 28 ways for you to die in Zork.

1238
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
One of them is getting eaten by a grue, I know that.

1239
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:46,000
And you can actually beat the game in 228 moves by exploiting a bug.

1240
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
That's what they're saying.

1241
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:51,000
So I guess you could speedrun Zork if you really wanted to.

1242
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
I wonder if he'll do that in a future Awesome Games Done Quick.

1243
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:56,000
You'll have to be able to read fast in order to do that. I don't know.

1244
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:59,000
But anyway, it's a text adventure game,

1245
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:03,000
so I don't know how many of you guys really got to check this out or play it,

1246
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:06,000
but they did do some interesting re-releases of the game.

1247
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
I remember this was on GameTap.

1248
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:12,000
Remember the GameTap thing, when you rented all the games for whatever?

1249
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
Zork, the whole trilogy, was there on GameTap.

1250
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:17,000
That was probably the most recent time I played that series.

1251
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:20,000
But also, what was this?

1252
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:25,000
In Call of Duty Black Ops in 2010, there's actually an Easter egg

1253
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:29,000
where you can get up in the main menu from a chair and find a computer,

1254
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:33,000
and if you type Zork into the computer, you play Zork 1,

1255
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:36,000
and the full game is in Call of Duty Black Ops,

1256
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:39,000
because Activision now owns all these licenses back from the Infocom days.

1257
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:43,000
So that's pretty cool. That's one way that you can do it there.

1258
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
Did you know there were parodies as well?

1259
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
I did not know this, Loki, but there were parody games of Zork.

1260
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:48,000
It was so popular.

1261
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:54,000
In 1988, they released Pork, the great underground sewer system.

1262
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
How about that?

1263
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:00,000
It's like straight out of Mad Magazine. I love it.

1264
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,000
Anyway, Zork was a game that had a huge legacy.

1265
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:06,000
There were all sorts of sequels, including the Enchanter trilogy,

1266
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:09,000
was the next thing released, which included Enchanter, Sorcerer, and Spellbreaker.

1267
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:14,000
Wishbringer was kind of a side story that was also in the Zork universe.

1268
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:17,000
There was then Beyond Zork and Zork Zero.

1269
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:20,000
But then, after a five-year hiatus in 1993,

1270
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:24,000
that's when Return to Zork came out, which was a CD-ROM game.

1271
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
Did you ever play Return to Zork?

1272
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
I never played any of the Zork games.

1273
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:32,000
Return to Zork is awesome because it's one of the peak games

1274
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:35,000
with the incredibly bad CD-ROM acting.

1275
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:39,000
Oh, shoot. I closed the YouTube with the guy acting.

1276
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,000
I didn't want the voice getting in here.

1277
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:44,000
Hold on. Let me get to the part where he opens the mailbox in this video

1278
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,000
and check out...

1279
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:49,000
I know this is really great radio, but listen to this acting.

1280
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:52,000
Ah, the sweepstakes winner.

1281
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:53,000
I've been looking forward to...

1282
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
No! No!

1283
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,000
No!

1284
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:06,000
Totally done how somebody would do their YouTube now,

1285
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:11,000
with a piece of fabric from Jo-Ann's hung behind them

1286
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:14,000
in their living room studio.

1287
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,000
I love it. Anyway.

1288
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
So Zork had some amazing...

1289
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Return to Zork had some amazing...

1290
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:23,000
So what exactly was Zork? What is a Zork?

1291
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:27,000
You would ask that. Zork was...

1292
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:31,000
It's like a place, I'm assuming?

1293
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:35,000
No, because the place was the great underground empire.

1294
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:38,000
And SSU100Matt says it was a chapter in Ready Player One.

1295
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:42,000
Yes, they did play a very big part in Ready Player One

1296
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
because they had a whole bunch of these games in there

1297
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:47,000
that you actually play out in real life type thing

1298
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:48,000
and Zork was one of those.

1299
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,000
Okay, so here it is.

1300
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:52,000
The word Zork is a nonsense word.

1301
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Often used by MIT hackers as the name for any unfinished program

1302
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
until they were ready to be installed on the system.

1303
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:03,000
With the game complete, they renamed the game Dungeon.

1304
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
By this time, the game was already quite popular

1305
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:08,000
and becoming relatively well known in gaming circles.

1306
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:11,000
Sometime in 1978, the developers received notice from TSR,

1307
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
the publishers of Dungeons & Dragons,

1308
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
who claimed the game violated their copyrights.

1309
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:19,000
So to avoid any legal wrangling, they changed the name back to Zork.

1310
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:23,000
So it is a complete nonsense word.

1311
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:26,000
I believe in the later games, it does end up being representative

1312
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
of the land that you're going to.

1313
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:32,000
But anyway, Return to Zork came out

1314
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:36,000
and then they had the Philosopher's Stone.

1315
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,000
Jesus Christ, I can't speak.

1316
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:40,000
Zork Nemesis came out in 1996

1317
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:43,000
and then Zork the Undiscovered Underground in 1997

1318
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:46,000
and then the last game in the Zork series

1319
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:49,000
was Zork Grand Inquisitor which came out in 1997

1320
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:52,000
and that was the last time that the Zork series was really visited.

1321
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:55,000
I actually owned Grand Inquisitor because I like those games

1322
01:33:55,000 --> 01:34:02,000
and they reminded me of a very fond time in my computer gaming life

1323
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:05,000
when I was a kid, so I have a soft spot for these games.

1324
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
Anyway, there it is, your classic game of the week,

1325
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:10,000
Text Adventure Zork.

1326
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:13,000
And even I learned tonight, it's a completely nonsensical word.

1327
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
But a great series of games.

1328
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Alright, we're going to take a break though for now.

1329
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:21,000
When we come back, there's plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come,

1330
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:24,000
including games that are coming out this week,

1331
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,000
what's in stores this week.

1332
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:28,000
We're going to talk a little bit about updates on PlayStation Now

1333
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:33,000
on Xbox One and did the NES classic, the mini classic,

1334
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,000
did it end production?

1335
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,000
If you don't have one...

1336
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
Did it start production?

1337
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:40,000
We'll answer those questions and more

1338
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:44,000
when we come back after this break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1339
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:54,000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio Live Tonight,

1340
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:57,000
episode number 676 already in progress for this,

1341
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
February the 19th of 2017.

1342
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
We're going to get into rapid fire news here shortly,

1343
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:05,000
but first, I don't usually do this on the air,

1344
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:09,000
but this is something for one of our long-time listeners.

1345
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:12,000
I've known this guy for years and years now it seems.

1346
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:13,000
He's a good friend of the show.

1347
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:17,000
It's our pal Ranma over back east from New York,

1348
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:20,000
part of Anime Jam Session, which by the way,

1349
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:25,000
a related shout out here, is celebrating 300 episodes live this Tuesday.

1350
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:31,000
So big snaps to the gang over at Anime Jam Session for that achievement

1351
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
and be sure to be here live on Tuesday when that goes on.

1352
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:38,000
But anyway, one way to get my attention is to send presents to the show.

1353
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
So Ranma has sent a present to the show,

1354
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:44,000
but it very clearly says, do not open package until next Sunday's show.

1355
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
Well, guess what? It's Sunday.

1356
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:50,000
But see, I'm worried it's going to be something for Jamie in here.

1357
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
It's probably Gwyneth Paltrow's head.

1358
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
It's probably just Gwyneth Paltrow's head in the box.

1359
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:57,000
Well, I'm now, okay, I swear I have not looked in the box.

1360
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:58,000
Do you hear me?

1361
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:01,000
I did, during the break, I went and tried to loosen up some of the tape,

1362
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
but that's all I've done to it to try to make this a little easier to open

1363
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:04,000
live on air.

1364
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
I think, ooh, do I feel bubble wrap?

1365
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,000
My favorite.

1366
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:10,000
He just sent me a wad of bubble wrap to sit there and pop, pop, pop.

1367
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Do you think it's any, yeah, there is bubble wrap,

1368
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:17,000
but do you think, just guesses on what it might be before I open this,

1369
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,000
because do you think it could be,

1370
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
I know we were talking about Dunkin Donuts coffee last week.

1371
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:23,000
I have a feeling it could, well, but no, I think he sent this before that.

1372
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:26,000
But I'm going to guess it's something Dunkin Donuts.

1373
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:27,000
You have a guess, Loki?

1374
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:28,000
What did Ranma send us?

1375
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,000
I don't know.

1376
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:30,000
All right, we'll find out. Here we go.

1377
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Let's see.

1378
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
If it's a donut, it's probably not survive the trip.

1379
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:36,000
Can you talk us through this so I can, while I open this?

1380
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,000
Yes, I'll let you.

1381
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
He put a lot of fucking tape in this thing.

1382
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:46,000
Yes, so there's red, red bubble wrap there.

1383
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
Come on.

1384
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:49,000
Where's your knife?

1385
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Where did I put the scissors?

1386
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
I don't see him.

1387
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,000
I got him, I got him.

1388
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
This is great radio, Loki.

1389
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:56,000
Don't cut yourself.

1390
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,000
I'm trying.

1391
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
God damn it, Ranma.

1392
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:04,000
He just wants to make sure that no one steals anything.

1393
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,000
This bitch.

1394
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:07,000
What did he send you?

1395
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:12,000
This is something where I think JB had to be here.

1396
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:17,000
It is a bag of mini Stroop waffles,

1397
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
for those of you that were here for the Christmas episode.

1398
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:23,000
Not the liqueur, like we were indulging on Christmas,

1399
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:28,000
but an actual bag of, like, the candy or whatever it is.

1400
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
The actual waffle. Do you like waffles, Loki?

1401
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:31,000
Of course, who doesn't?

1402
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:35,000
So you're going to like these, which are caramel flavored, apparently.

1403
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:38,000
You made me wait until the show for that.

1404
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:44,000
I can't believe you sent this big old box to send us that.

1405
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:45,000
And all this bubble wrap.

1406
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:49,000
I'm so excited to pop each and every one of those bubbles later on.

1407
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:50,000
There it is.

1408
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:51,000
That's it?

1409
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:52,000
Yep.

1410
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:53,000
Loki, don't be ungrateful.

1411
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
This is amazing.

1412
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
I just thought that box would be more...

1413
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:02,000
I know, I'm laughing because this poor guy spent this money

1414
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:05,000
to send us a big old box for some Stroop waffles.

1415
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:06,000
I love it, though.

1416
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
These are going to be some delicious fucking Stroop waffles.

1417
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,000
Thank you, Rama.

1418
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:12,000
Rama said it's made with the liqueur.

1419
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
All right, I guess I better open this up here.

1420
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:17,000
Loki, why don't we get to some rapid fire news while I open this up

1421
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
and then we can indulge in some of these on air.

1422
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
And as far as Jamie's concerned...

1423
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
Shh, don't tell her.

1424
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:24,000
Don't tell her.

1425
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
Don't tell her. We didn't get anything.

1426
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
He just sent us bubble wrap. It was so rude.

1427
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
All right, Loki.

1428
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:35,000
All right, so Valve has finally patched a bug in Team Fortress 2.

1429
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:38,000
And this was a 10-year-old bug, actually.

1430
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:42,000
So what it was, apparently there was an issue with hit boxes,

1431
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:50,000
depending on if you started off as a scout, heavier sniper class,

1432
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:55,000
and then switched to a soldier pyro or demoman, engineer, medic, spy, or whatever.

1433
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:59,000
There's going to be a discrepancy between your character's avatar hit box

1434
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:02,000
due to the difference in the class's programming.

1435
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:07,000
And apparently, because of that, it allowed certain hits not to be detected

1436
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
and some to be detected when they shouldn't have been.

1437
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:12,000
So now it's been fixed.

1438
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
So that's pretty awesome.

1439
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
It took him 10 years to fix that.

1440
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:22,000
And then Final Fantasy XV is getting cup noodle.

1441
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:27,000
Final Fantasy headgear.

1442
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:30,000
It looks so epic.

1443
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
Wearing cup noodle in your head.

1444
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
I thought we got into this a little bit last week.

1445
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
Didn't they announce, though, how this is coming out in the States now?

1446
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:41,000
Because I know in Japan, you can only get this through buying all the ultra-rare cup of noodles.

1447
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:44,000
Didn't they announce how it was going to come out over here?

1448
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
No.

1449
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
I thought they did.

1450
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:51,000
They said something about some DLC kit was going to have it in there.

1451
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:55,000
Well, they're saying that it's going to be...

1452
01:39:55,000 --> 01:40:04,000
Originally, you had the Final Fantasy Boss Collection, which was 6,084 yen.

1453
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:11,000
And then, of course, now it's going to be available to download for the Boss Collection buyers sometime this summer.

1454
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:16,000
So when you buy the cup noodle Final Fantasy Boss Collection.

1455
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:21,000
I think the next convention I go to, maybe for MagWest or something,

1456
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
I'm going to wear a giant cup noodle hat.

1457
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:24,000
Why not?

1458
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
It'll be an easy thing.

1459
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
It'll be an easy thing to do.

1460
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
It's just ridiculous.

1461
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:34,000
Like, you guys are taking this cup noodle thing way too far.

1462
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Well, I mean, seriously, come on.

1463
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:39,000
You have this epic game, Final Fantasy, and then you put this in there.

1464
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
It's kind of ridiculous.

1465
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
It's more of a Hitman thing.

1466
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
And on a related note, try one of these stroopwafels.

1467
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:46,000
They're fucking amazing.

1468
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
Rama, they are so fucking good.

1469
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
I'm making Loki try one.

1470
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:51,000
Loki never eats food.

1471
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,000
It's like a cookie.

1472
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
It's very good.

1473
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
And Maya in chat says Sky has stroopwafel mouth.

1474
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:59,000
Yeah, maybe I've already eaten like three of them.

1475
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
It doesn't taste like much.

1476
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:08,000
Loki, next time you send a gift to the show, Rama, just say not for Loki.

1477
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
Loki not allowed.

1478
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
They're great.

1479
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
I was expecting waffle tasting.

1480
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
It does taste a little like waffle.

1481
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:17,000
You don't taste the waffle?

1482
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
You want me to get some of that liquor?

1483
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:20,000
That tastes like waffle.

1484
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
No, I don't mean waffle liquor.

1485
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
I'm going to save some of these.

1486
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:25,000
They're fucking Dens.

1487
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:26,000
Yeah, I know. They're really good.

1488
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
They've got a lot of caramel in them.

1489
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
I'm going to save some for Alan.

1490
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
I'm sure he'll be excited to try that when he gets home.

1491
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:36,000
And maybe one or two will last through the week before Jaime's here next.

1492
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:37,000
We'll see.

1493
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
But you know, you snooze, you lose.

1494
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
Should have been at the show.

1495
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:42,000
All right.

1496
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
Cough or no cough, you could add stroopwafel.

1497
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:45,000
It would have made it better.

1498
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:46,000
All right.

1499
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:49,000
In all seriousness, let's move on and talk about Injustice 2.

1500
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:54,000
Some folks excited for that upcoming game in the fighting series

1501
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:57,000
that made by the same people that make Mortal Kombat.

1502
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:01,000
And some more characters have been announced this week in a trailer.

1503
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:04,000
Cheetah is one of the new characters that's going to be in the game.

1504
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:08,000
A villain from the Wonder Woman universe, if you were unaware.

1505
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:13,000
Also, Poison Ivy and Catwoman confirmed in the game.

1506
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:17,000
So this is all kind of like a girl power type of trailer, if you will,

1507
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:20,000
showing off some of the new characters in Injustice 2.

1508
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
So looks pretty cool.

1509
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
I like the first Injustice game.

1510
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,000
It was pretty good.

1511
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:26,000
Self-inplayed it.

1512
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:27,000
I have it in my library.

1513
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:28,000
Need to get on that.

1514
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:29,000
Need to get on that.

1515
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:30,000
Have a play.

1516
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:31,000
All right.

1517
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:32,000
Let's see.

1518
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
And this is something you really need to get on.

1519
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
And unfortunately, if you are listening to the podcast,

1520
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
you're probably too late for this unless you already got it.

1521
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:39,000
Those of you that are listening...

1522
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:40,000
Oh, yeah.

1523
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:41,000
I should buy that.

1524
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:42,000
Yeah.

1525
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:43,000
Those of you that are listening live,

1526
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:44,000
you literally have your last chance this evening

1527
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:45,000
because it's going away tomorrow.

1528
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:48,000
But it is the Humble Freedom Bundle.

1529
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:51,000
And this is a hell of a Humble Bundle.

1530
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:54,000
Now, it is a $30 minimum,

1531
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:57,000
which usually with Humble Bundle you're only paying $1.

1532
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:02,000
But this is definitely going to be worth the $30 baseline.

1533
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
So the Humble Freedom Bundle,

1534
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
which you have 15 hours left to get and counting,

1535
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
has like...

1536
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
There's like 30-plus games in this.

1537
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
There's an insane amount of games in this.

1538
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
And the money that you donate,

1539
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:17,000
you can't even choose to give it to the game makers

1540
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
or as a Humble tip.

1541
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:22,000
100% of these bundles will...

1542
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:26,000
Yeah, 100% of the proceeds will go to one of these three charities

1543
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:27,000
or all of these three charities

1544
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:30,000
or however you choose to divide up your donation

1545
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:31,000
between these three charities,

1546
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:34,000
which includes the ACLU, Doctors Without Borders,

1547
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
and the International Rescue Committee.

1548
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
So, I mean, and when I say like huge games,

1549
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
you've got things like The Witness,

1550
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:43,000
which I think is 30 bucks itself,

1551
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:46,000
Stardew Valley, the Day of the Tentacle remake,

1552
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:49,000
you know, some things that have been in bundles before

1553
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:52,000
like VVVV, Super Meat Boy, World of Goo,

1554
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:55,000
but then even some newer releases are in here too

1555
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
like 2064 Read Only Memories,

1556
01:43:57,000 --> 01:44:02,000
which just had that big patch that they did a couple weeks ago.

1557
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:03,000
Let's see.

1558
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:06,000
I just bought this game on Steam like a few...

1559
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:09,000
like probably a month ago, Robot Roller Derby Disco Dodgeball.

1560
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
Anyway, lots and lots and lots of games.

1561
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:12,000
Also, e-books.

1562
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:15,000
So you can get things like the hands-on intro to game programming

1563
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:16,000
is available as well.

1564
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:19,000
So anyhow, that's it.

1565
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:20,000
I mean, there's tons in there.

1566
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
Also, yeah, and it's pointed out,

1567
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
clever username in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com

1568
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:27,000
says Subnautica, they sold out of keys.

1569
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:28,000
Yeah, they...

1570
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:31,000
Same with Super Meat Boy, but the DRM versions there.

1571
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
Right, and to be fair,

1572
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
they did warn you that some of these games

1573
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:36,000
would have a limited number.

1574
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
And to be honest, I already have Super Meat Boy,

1575
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:39,000
so that's no big deal.

1576
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
I have most of these games already.

1577
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
Yeah, I know there's a lot of these games I have,

1578
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:44,000
but it is a really good cause.

1579
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:45,000
Yeah, it's a really good cause.

1580
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
And even just some of the e-books and stuff

1581
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:48,000
I think are kind of cool,

1582
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:51,000
like the whole programming one is probably one I could use.

1583
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
There's even some music in there too,

1584
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:54,000
which I think is pretty rad.

1585
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
So yeah, check that out.

1586
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:57,000
The Humble Freedom Bundle.

1587
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:58,000
There's only 15 hours left,

1588
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
so if you're listening to this on the podcast,

1589
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:01,000
if it's already after...

1590
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
Let's see, what would 15 hours from now be?

1591
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:07,000
That's going to be 11 a.m. Pacific, about.

1592
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:10,000
So if it's after that, you might be out of luck.

1593
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:13,000
So anyhow, that's it.

1594
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
Let's travel around and check out what is in stores this week.

1595
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:16,000
Loki.

1596
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:19,000
Alright, and I just purchased my Humble Freedom Bundle,

1597
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:22,000
so we're good there.

1598
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
Okay, this week we do have some things.

1599
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:27,000
So we've got Berserk and the Band of the Hawk

1600
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:31,000
on PC, PlayStation 4, and the Vita.

1601
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:36,000
Halo Wars 2 on Xbox One and Windows 10.

1602
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:39,000
Ys Origin on PlayStation 4.

1603
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:45,000
And then that's actually it.

1604
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:46,000
Next week, though, we've got some...

1605
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:49,000
Or the week after, we've got some good stuff too.

1606
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:52,000
Well, because the Switch is happening the week after, right?

1607
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:56,000
Yeah, but Horizon Zero Dawn also is coming out the following week.

1608
01:45:56,000 --> 01:46:00,000
Oh, I realize that was out.

1609
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
Let's travel to Japan right now

1610
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
and check out some of the releases over there.

1611
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:08,000
On February 23rd, which is my mom's birthday.

1612
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
Happy birthday, mom.

1613
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:15,000
In Japan, Nier Automata comes out on February 23rd.

1614
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
Super Robot Wars V.

1615
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
Batman Return to Arkham.

1616
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:23,000
Majotohai Kihei comes out.

1617
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:28,000
And, let's see, Assassin's Creed, the Ezio collection is all out.

1618
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:31,000
And that's all on the PlayStation 4 this week.

1619
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:35,000
I'm sure that Nier game has a lot of people interested in that.

1620
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:39,000
There's also a brand new white DualShock 4 controller coming out.

1621
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
And, oh, I missed some of these.

1622
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:44,000
There's also Ride 2 is out this week.

1623
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:47,000
So this is a busy, busy, busy week over in Japan for those games.

1624
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
On the Vita, it doesn't slow down.

1625
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
Super Robot Wars V is also on the Vita.

1626
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:54,000
Island is out this week on the PlayStation Vita.

1627
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
Timepiece Ensemble comes out,

1628
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:03,000
as well as Galgun Doublepiece Bilingual comes out on the PlayStation Vita.

1629
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:06,000
And, lastly, just checking out the Nintendo 3DS.

1630
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:10,000
I don't think they really have anything because they probably are gearing up over there

1631
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:13,000
for the Nintendo Switch release over there as well.

1632
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
So, there you go.

1633
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
How about the UK, Loki?

1634
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
I know Dark Soccer's not here, but maybe you can help her out.

1635
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
Yeah, not a whole ton of stuff coming out.

1636
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
Now, Shift Happens.

1637
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:26,000
That's on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1638
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:29,000
And, also, Lego Worlds is getting its console debut.

1639
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:32,000
That's that kind of Lego-cross-Minecraft game.

1640
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:36,000
And that's on PlayStation, yeah, PlayStation 4, Xbox One.

1641
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:39,000
I thought that was the one they said they weren't going to make anymore.

1642
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
Maybe I'm, like, clearly I'm crazy.

1643
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
You're thinking mostly the online one.

1644
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
No, this is the one that was in Early Access for a while

1645
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
and then finally is out of Early Access.

1646
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:50,000
I still haven't played it. I've gotten to it when it was in beta.

1647
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
So, this has been a long time since I actually tried it out.

1648
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:55,000
But, yeah.

1649
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:58,000
So, that was a thing.

1650
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:02,000
I thought this was coming out over here as well at some point soon,

1651
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:06,000
but maybe that was on, like, a TBA release date.

1652
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
Let me try to see here.

1653
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
Oh, yeah, that was earlier this month.

1654
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
So, that was back on the 7th.

1655
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
Oh, no, I'm sorry. That's in March.

1656
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
So, we're getting a little bit later over here.

1657
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
All right.

1658
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
So, that's really it.

1659
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
All right. Let's go to our mailbag.

1660
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
Every week you guys send us e-mails.

1661
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

1662
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:36,000
And we read said e-mails on the show.

1663
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
Of course, some weeks are better than others.

1664
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
Some weeks we get a lot of e-mails.

1665
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
Some weeks we don't get any e-mails.

1666
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
And this is one of those weeks where we have one e-mail.

1667
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
So, thank you to our one e-mailer this week.

1668
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

1669
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:52,000
Our e-mail this week from YYR, serial e-mailer, to the program.

1670
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
Hello, LR.

1671
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:57,000
I wanted to send you a lousy e-mail so you had something to not read.

1672
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
Well, when you're it, buddy, guess what?

1673
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
I read it anyway.

1674
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:04,000
I'm really glad you mentioned the DDR finals on last week's show.

1675
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:07,000
And I'd encourage anyone interested to head over to YouTube and watch them.

1676
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:11,000
I can also explain why you didn't recognize much of the song list used for the finals.

1677
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:14,000
Back in DDR Extreme, the absolute hardest thing in the game

1678
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:17,000
was the challenge chart for Paranoia Survivor Max.

1679
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:23,000
In DDR Ace, that chart is rated 16 on the difficulty scale out of a possible 19.

1680
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:27,000
But the only charts allowed in the finals were rated 17 and up,

1681
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:32,000
which means that literally 100% of DDR Extreme was deemed to be too easy.

1682
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
Time to get good.

1683
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:38,000
By the way, is it just me or have you guys quietly retired the FUs of the Week segment?

1684
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:41,000
I haven't noticed it lately.

1685
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
It wasn't intentionally quietly retired.

1686
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:46,000
It was supposed to be, during our big show roll, shake-up thing,

1687
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
moved to the end of the show.

1688
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:51,000
And I think part of what happened with that is that when it was supposed to be...

1689
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:52,000
We just keep forgetting to do it?

1690
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:53,000
We just keep forgetting to do it.

1691
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:56,000
And now it's kind of one of those things... I got to admit, I kind of don't miss it.

1692
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
Yeah, I don't either.

1693
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
So, I don't know. It's one of those things...

1694
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:04,000
I'm not going to say it's gone, but it's on an as-needed basis.

1695
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:08,000
Because there's certainly going to be things that we're going to need to F you once in a while.

1696
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:11,000
Which I know might be sad because it's a thing we've done ever since episode one,

1697
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:16,000
but at the same time, maybe we have enough cynical stuff in video games.

1698
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:19,000
And maybe we don't necessarily need more.

1699
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
But again, when it's warranted, it will be here.

1700
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:24,000
I feel like a lot of times when we're actually doing FUs of the Week,

1701
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
it's like a struggle to think of something right away.

1702
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
There's been a lot of weeks recently where people are like,

1703
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
eh, I don't really have anything this week. It's been a good week.

1704
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
So, you know.

1705
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:35,000
But again, Jamie's not here to speak either.

1706
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:38,000
I think she would feel very differently on this where she probably...

1707
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:41,000
But then again, she probably hasn't noticed it's been missing either.

1708
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
But, you know, again, I'm not going to say it's gone.

1709
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:46,000
It's just going to be as an as-needed basis at this point.

1710
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:49,000
So when there's things to rant about, we'll rant about it.

1711
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:54,000
And SSG100Matt does point out, bad drivers did get the most FUs, lifetime-wise.

1712
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:59,000
You know, on the inevitable day when OLR ends, maybe that's how we'll end it.

1713
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:04,000
We'll end it with a gigantic FU and then roll credits.

1714
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
Does that sound good?

1715
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
Sure, why not?

1716
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:09,000
All right.

1717
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
OLR continues on.

1718
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:14,000
By the way, props to you for catching that.

1719
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:17,000
I did notice that we hadn't done it in a while.

1720
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:20,000
But I kind of didn't want to shine a spotlight on it because, again,

1721
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
we might want to bring it back or whatever.

1722
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:25,000
But props to you for noticing.

1723
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
Can't sneak one by you.

1724
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:31,000
Why don't you go do something productive like find Carmen Sandiego?

1725
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:34,000
All right, anyway.

1726
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:35,000
The email finishes.

1727
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:38,000
I don't have much else to say, so I'll leave you with this.

1728
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:43,000
If you value your free time at all, avoid Pocket Card Jockey on 3DS.

1729
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:48,000
It's developed by Game Freak, a.k.a. the Pokemon developers,

1730
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:51,000
and it's a cross between Derby Owners Club and Solitaire.

1731
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:54,000
And I'm addicted.

1732
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:55,000
Oh, I see.

1733
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:56,000
This is one of those.

1734
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
Avoid it because you'll get sucked into it as well.

1735
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
It's like the Derby Owners Club, now that we think about this.

1736
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
Do they have it emulated on PC yet?

1737
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:06,000
I could see myself wasting a lot of time on that.

1738
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
That's a very good question.

1739
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Why wouldn't we have that?

1740
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:11,000
Can you imagine that?

1741
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:12,000
They've emulated everything.

1742
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
That's what we need on the Switch right there.

1743
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:15,000
Have that shit.

1744
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
YYR says it is not emulated.

1745
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:22,000
Must be the crazy fact that it's on multiple monitors and all this stuff.

1746
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
Yeah, that's all networks together.

1747
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
YYR says you have to emulate the networking card system too.

1748
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
That's why it's not out yet.

1749
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
Anyway.

1750
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:31,000
So there you go.

1751
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:32,000
That's me.

1752
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:33,000
It's signed.

1753
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:34,000
Aaron, YYR.

1754
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:35,000
Good email, Aaron.

1755
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
You get the gold star email of the week.

1756
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
Do you know why you got the gold star email of the week?

1757
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
Nobody else emailed us.

1758
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:42,000
There you go.

1759
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
A gold star all for you, YYR.

1760
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
Congratulations.

1761
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:47,000
All right.

1762
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:48,000
That's going to do it for the mailbag.

1763
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:53,000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want a gold star by default in future weeks.

1764
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
In the meantime, we have more gaming news to get to,

1765
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:58,000
and then we are going to open up that Skype line a little later,

1766
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

1767
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:01,000
Loki.

1768
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
Well, this is definitely a service I don't give a shit about.

1769
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:06,000
PlayStation Now, have not used it, have no interest in using it,

1770
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:10,000
but it's still a thing because sure as shit,

1771
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:14,000
they're not going to give us any fucking support for PlayStation 2 or PlayStation 1 games anymore.

1772
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:17,000
That fucking PlayStation Pro can render that 4K display,

1773
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:22,000
but fuck if it can render goddamn PlayStation 1 and PlayStation 2 games.

1774
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
It's just too complex for that thing.

1775
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
PSP can handle it though.

1776
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:33,000
But they are dropping support now for the PlayStation 3 and the Vita and other devices.

1777
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:41,000
So now PlayStation Now will only work on the PlayStation 4 and the PC.

1778
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
So anything else?

1779
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
Not going to happen.

1780
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:52,000
That is kind of shady that the Vita and the Vita TV are getting the shaft on that one.

1781
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:56,000
It wasn't that long ago that they were pushing that Vita TV.

1782
01:53:56,000 --> 01:54:01,000
But at the same time, would I miss PlayStation Now?

1783
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
Probably not.

1784
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:08,000
Does PlayStation Now have PlayStation 4 games in it or is it just PS3 games?

1785
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
I believe it's only PS3 games.

1786
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
Maybe they're adding PlayStation 4 games.

1787
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:13,000
Okay, maybe.

1788
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:17,000
Woo, don't care though because I still want PlayStation 2 games and PlayStation 1 games.

1789
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:20,000
I just think, look, I get what they were trying to do.

1790
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:24,000
Well, at first I didn't understand what they were trying to do, but now they have the whole Netflix model, right?

1791
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
I think that they're really missing it.

1792
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
They're missing the opportunity.

1793
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:33,000
They have these really deep sales sometimes on PlayStation 2 games, I think.

1794
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
But they're only on PS3.

1795
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:41,000
I have to pay $15 to get a PlayStation 2 game to run on PlayStation 4.

1796
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:46,000
It's not the stuff that I already have in my library, which they know I have in my library.

1797
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:52,000
But I would really love it if they added that support because you could have, with all these deep sales that they do,

1798
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:57,000
just this impulse factor building up that library kind of like your Steam library.

1799
01:54:57,000 --> 01:55:06,000
It is kind of, actually no, it's really irritating that things that I bought digitally on PlayStation 3 that are supported by PlayStation Now,

1800
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
I can't just play through PlayStation Now.

1801
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
I think that's one of those concessions.

1802
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
Maybe Sony doesn't want to do it because of bandwidth or power or something,

1803
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:16,000
but I think if Sony wants PlayStation Now to become a better thing,

1804
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:22,000
they need to get more eyes on it by giving you incentive for things that you've already got in the past.

1805
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:26,000
And they'll make a sale when they sell more games on PlayStation 3 or whatever stuff in the past.

1806
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:32,000
I think the way they went about doing the whole thing was just not the best.

1807
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:39,000
And I understand, though, to their credit, for whatever it's worth, they probably had to renegotiate a lot of agreements.

1808
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:45,000
I don't think maybe you necessarily had the right to stream a game just because it existed on PlayStation 3.

1809
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:50,000
They probably had to go renegotiate with those companies, and that's why PlayStation Now's stock is limited.

1810
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:57,000
But at the same time, for those companies that see the value in letting their PS3 games go on sale again, just do it.

1811
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
I don't like the service, and here's why.

1812
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:05,000
Because when I'm playing games, a lot of times my wife is streaming video.

1813
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:17,000
So I can't have, even my bandwidth is pretty good, but I can't have a really nice stream for GameStream to go along with a video stream they have through Netflix.

1814
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:21,000
It can't fit that kind of bandwidth on my system.

1815
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:33,000
And so that's a problem because I've tried streaming, you can do the second screen support or whatever with your PC on PlayStation 4 and play it that way.

1816
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:43,000
And it doesn't work well at all in my house, even though my PlayStation 4 is literally six feet away, and my router is like six feet away.

1817
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:47,000
It's just like, it's right in front of me. But it still doesn't work on that network.

1818
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:54,000
Did VibRibbon ever come out on PlayStation 4? Didn't they promise that when VibRibbon was first unveiled?

1819
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:58,000
I don't remember. I can check.

1820
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
Brad from PodCulture suggests hardwiring it?

1821
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:10,000
Yeah, I could do that since it is that far away, but I shouldn't have to do that. I shouldn't have to go through this hassle to be able to play a game.

1822
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:14,000
I mean, it should just work as is.

1823
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:28,000
Alright, well, last week we talked about this a little bit, but it sounds like it's been growing this past week, and that is more support for Beam, which is of course Microsoft's answer to Twitch, or they recently acquired Beam.

1824
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:39,000
Which I have a channel over on Beam, and I did enjoy streaming over there. There's not quite the same big community that you have on Twitch, so it can be harder to get discovered over there.

1825
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:48,000
But it's going to be interesting to see how this changes the game a little bit, because now you can actually stream to Beam within the Xbox One.

1826
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:59,000
We talked about this a little bit last week. It was in the Alpha program this week, but now it's actually been opened up to more people through a Beam app on Xbox One.

1827
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:06,000
I do believe you still have to be in the Insider program. I don't think you are open to everybody yet. You do just have to be in the Xbox Insider program.

1828
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:17,000
But apparently, you know why I didn't realize this, Loki? With as little as I play Xbox One, I'm not in the Alpha circle, but I'm in the next circle on Xbox One.

1829
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:28,000
I actually get a lot of this stuff. For the preview stuff, Microsoft rolls it out in circles. The Alphas get it first, then there's an inner circle, then there's a bigger circle, and then it's like everybody.

1830
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:40,000
Well apparently, I'm in one of the inner circles, and I didn't even realize this. But it's probably because I actually did some of the surveys and things in the preview program app, so maybe it gained my favor? I don't know.

1831
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:47,000
William Murderface is asking my Beam channel name. Same as Twitch. Rob Roberts is what it is over on Beam.

1832
01:58:47,000 --> 01:59:00,000
Anyway, for Beam, now there's a whole little app that you can use with it if you're in the Insider program. You hit the guide button and you go to the Beam menu icon to start broadcasting.

1833
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:07,000
You can turn your microphone on and off. You can also do camera on and off, although I'm assuming that's only Kinect. It's still not going to support just any old camera.

1834
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:16,000
You can also do chat, camera position, overlay, and all that good stuff. You can also, inside the app, watch and interact with channels on Beam in real time.

1835
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:27,000
You can also get the sparks and the XP. They try to incentivize watching streams by giving you XP, and then you can use these sparks that you earn to interact with streams.

1836
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:38,000
It's interesting. I like Beam's approach. It's going to be interesting to see how this grows through 2017. They are definitely trying to do something even more interactive than what Twitch is so far.

1837
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:50,000
There you go. They are going to also announce more for Beam at GDC 2017. It looks like Microsoft is really realizing that Amazon is really not competed with in the Twitch space effectively.

1838
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:59,000
I do know that there's Hitbox and YouTube, but YouTube kind of has its own set of problems, and YouTube gaming really hasn't picked up the way it ought to be.

1839
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:06,000
But YouTube has its own problems with the copyright claims and all that stuff, so that turns a lot of people off to YouTube to begin with.

1840
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:18,000
So yeah, I think Microsoft is kind of seeing an opportunity here. We'll see what they do with it, but you know their press conference ain't going to stream on Twitch this year.

1841
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:22,000
It's going to stream on Beam. Mark my words. Anyway.

1842
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:25,000
I'll just watch it on YouTube.

1843
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:28,000
Let's move on. Low-key.

1844
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:31,000
All right.

1845
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:39,000
So it looks like one of the things that we may be hearing about the new, during their press conference, is about Scorpio.

1846
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:51,000
And so actually they're going to be unveiling information about the Scorpio during the press conference on June 11th, which is different than what's been in the past.

1847
02:00:51,000 --> 02:01:00,000
It's now moving to Sunday, which I did like how Bethesda put a little thing out there, you know, hey, imitating this. Okay, cool.

1848
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:06,000
But yeah, they're going to be doing their press conference at 2 p.m. Pacific time, so that'll be earlier that day.

1849
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:11,000
Did you make your flights for E3 already? Too bad. Rebook.

1850
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:20,000
That's good news. Saturday is a cheaper travel day, I believe, because Friday and Sunday are big days, but Saturday is a little less, you know, is right in the middle of the weekend.

1851
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:25,000
So you might be able to get some better deals on Saturday. There's that. You have to get another night at the hotel, but oh well.

1852
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:28,000
I mean, man, that show is going to be pretty busy. Yeah.

1853
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:33,000
And by the way, thanks a lot, assholes, for doing that to us on Sunday when we're trying to do a show here at OLR.

1854
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:37,000
Although actually Microsoft should be done. Bethesda is the one that's right in the middle of our show.

1855
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:51,000
Yeah, which I guess we'll just have to do what we've done the past few years and do like our abbreviated show where we just watch the press conference with y'all and do an hour-long show because we don't have any other time to do it because we get cut off by E3.

1856
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:57,000
We could do with all the other streamers doing the reaction things, but I don't know if anyone wants to see that.

1857
02:01:57,000 --> 02:02:08,000
Yeah, I'm of the camp that nobody wants to see that. Like I'm fine with taping something that like later you can do, like the YouTube reaction videos and that stuff, but I just, I think it's a little silly.

1858
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:17,000
But anyway, so I don't know, I don't know what we're going to do that episode yet. It's still months off in advance and who knows what else is going to change with E3.

1859
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:21,000
Shit, maybe some miracle happens and I end up going, but I doubt it.

1860
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:32,000
But with E3 on that Sunday, the press conference, the interesting thing is going to be that we can talk about Microsoft now on our show. We just won't be able to talk about the other two.

1861
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
They did it just for us.

1862
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:42,000
What's Nintendo going to do this year? We don't know yet. Are they going to go back to a press conference since they did one for the Switch or are they going to do a direct? Who knows?

1863
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:47,000
No one knows. Just like no one knows what's going to happen to launch in two weeks of the Switch.

1864
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:56,000
All right. Well, no one knows what happened to the NES Classic Mini either. They are still pretty hard to get. I don't know. It seemed like some more came out recently.

1865
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:59,000
I want to get one still, but you know, it may be hard to find.

1866
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:16,000
But an interesting rumor hit the internet this week, thanks to NeoGaf, of course, from a user who worked for a big retailer in Scandinavia, who apparently posted that we just got word from Nintendo, or rather their Nordic distributor, that the NES Classic Mini has reached its end of life and will be phased out.

1867
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:21,000
According to them, production has ended and we will be receiving a few more shipments before everything dries up.

1868
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:26,000
By our estimates, we as a single retailer might not be able to fulfill all orders that have been in place so far.

1869
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:31,000
Our last shipment should arrive in April or May, and after that, there won't be any more shipments.

1870
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:39,000
Which made a lot of us kind of go, what the fuck? Why would you, like, this thing has been huge. Why would you fucking pull it off shelves?

1871
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:46,000
Now, but that is a rumor, I should stress, because there has been a follow-up.

1872
02:03:46,000 --> 02:04:00,000
Nintendo UK followed it up saying, quote, production for the Nintendo Classic Mini NES continues and NOE, Nintendo of Europe, will continue to ship units to retail on a regular basis.

1873
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:05,000
That was from a Nintendo UK representative, basically saying that first statement was full of shit.

1874
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
Here's what I think might be happening.

1875
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:20,000
We've had a lot of stories recently about how these things have been hacked to basically extract the Linux out of it and make it run emulators so that you can even play Super Nintendo games on your NES Classic Mini.

1876
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:26,000
These things are not online, so they cannot be patched out, the exploits, through a simple firmware update.

1877
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:33,000
Now, I don't necessarily want to start The Sky is Falling, but I have a feeling, and I don't put it past Nintendo to do it.

1878
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:41,000
Nintendo might be closing up whatever exploits these guys are using right now before they're going to put more of them out.

1879
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:46,000
That's what I think is happening. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe there's no reason for Nintendo to do this.

1880
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:54,000
It could be a miscommunication. I don't think they would do that. I don't think they're going to bother doing that, because most people aren't doing that.

1881
02:04:54,000 --> 02:05:00,000
Maybe they're not going to do it because they're just going to move it to the Nintendo Switch and they want people to buy a Nintendo Switch. I don't see that either, though.

1882
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:04,000
Why would you even want to do that? Because the average consumer is not going to know how to do that.

1883
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:11,000
And the ones that do know how to do that, if you patch that up, they're just going to fucking run it on a Raspberry Pi or something.

1884
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:20,000
Who cares? It's Linux. And even still, just because it's a Linux system that's running in the first place, good luck patching that.

1885
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:24,000
You're not going to patch it. It's fucking Linux. That shit's going to be broken open.

1886
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:30,000
You're just going to waste time and effort and money patching something up that's just going to get broken immediately.

1887
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:40,000
Again, I have nothing to base that on. That's just my... Why would a retailer think they're not going to get any more and then suddenly they are going to get more?

1888
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:48,000
I mean, it could be just as simple as, this guy didn't know what he was talking about. Sorry, that's so harsh, but that may be what it ends up being, a bad miscommunication or something.

1889
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:55,000
But I could see where Nintendo might put the brakes on for a bit to fix... That just seems like a very Nintendo thing to do.

1890
02:05:55,000 --> 02:06:03,000
That there will be a version B of the NES Classic Mini or something that does not allow the same workaround that they're doing right now.

1891
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:08,000
But hackers are going to hack and they'll find another way, just like Loki said, so it's probably not worth their time.

1892
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:11,000
Loki, moving on.

1893
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:19,000
Alright, so Microsoft is promising that there's going to be more Xbox One and Windows 10 exclusive games that are going to be highlighted.

1894
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:25,000
Of course, they're saying Sea of Thieves, State of Decay 2, and Crackdown 3 are some of those.

1895
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:31,000
That there's also going to be some more stuff in store at E3 2017 that they're going to announce.

1896
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:38,000
So expect more of those really annoying Windows 10, Xbox One exclusive.

1897
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:41,000
Which is really just any of their first party games. I mean, come on.

1898
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:45,000
Do we really need to say it's exclusive if Microsoft's making them?

1899
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:48,000
Well, maybe they'll get some from other people.

1900
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:51,000
Or I'm sorry, Capcom, in the case of Dead Rising.

1901
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:56,000
Or their scale bal- Oh, wait, sorry. Sore spot, sorry.

1902
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
Phantom Dust, no.

1903
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:04,000
Yeah, it would maybe help for there to be more exclusives that they'd stop being cancelled.

1904
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:12,000
That's kind of funny, though. It just reminds me that Crackdown 3 then would be on PC, so maybe I don't need to get an Xbox One.

1905
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:18,000
I was planning on buying a better PC anyways, or laptop, so hey.

1906
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:23,000
And how's the Scorpio thing going to change things? Because I imagine Microsoft is eyeing doing something.

1907
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:26,000
And maybe that's why they've been sitting on Crackdown.

1908
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:31,000
They're going to do something that's really going to push the limits of Scorpio, yet it still runs on Xbox One and Windows 10.

1909
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,000
Because that's the deal, right?

1910
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:37,000
Maybe they can do all that physics stuff that they were planning on doing through the cloud.

1911
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:39,000
Remember cloud, cloud, cloud, cloud, cloud? You know, all that stuff.

1912
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:44,000
So maybe now all the physics stuff can be done natively without having to be always online or something.

1913
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:45,000
Maybe.

1914
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:49,000
Maybe they can run PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 1 games.

1915
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:56,000
Wouldn't that be something if Microsoft came out and said you could run PlayStation games?

1916
02:07:56,000 --> 02:08:00,000
Wouldn't the patent on PlayStation hardware be expiring soon?

1917
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
Nah, it'll be 2019, I think.

1918
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
Bleem 3.0, 2.0?

1919
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
Bleem 3.0. Alright, anyway.

1920
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:12,000
One more story for you guys tonight. Do you guys know the song Pac-Man Fever, that classic song from the 80s?

1921
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:16,000
It's in rotation here at VOG Network, but I'm sure not a lot of you sit here and listen to the music all day at VOG.

1922
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
But you guys probably remember the song, right, from the 80s?

1923
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:22,000
Well, you know, there were a lot of parody songs written about video games back in the day,

1924
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:27,000
but you might wonder, like, well, where was the king of parody songs, Weird Al Yankovic, in all this?

1925
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:32,000
Well, it turns out Weird Al did write a song called Pac-Man.

1926
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:38,000
And in an interview with The Nerdist this week, he talks about how Pac-Man is now going to be coming to a new box set,

1927
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:42,000
like a rarity set that's coming out from Weird Al, called Squeeze Box.

1928
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
Oh yeah, the Squeeze Box. That's awesome.

1929
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:52,000
Yeah, Pac-Man is a parody of The Beatles' Taxman, and it's not that this song was never heard before.

1930
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:57,000
In fact, they even have it. You can actually stream it here on Vevo. You can actually hear the whole song.

1931
02:08:57,000 --> 02:09:04,000
I can play a little clip of it here. So you can see it's like a parody of Taxman.

1932
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:14,000
Anyway, so this song, and this is from early Weird Al Yankovic, right?

1933
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:18,000
So this is like when he was doing another one, Ride to the Bus and My Bologna.

1934
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:26,000
But these songs were, like, on The Dr. Domeno Show, you know, back when, like, he was huge on radio,

1935
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:31,000
and, you know, he was awesome. Like, I've heard tapes of that old show, and there's some really, like, awesome stuff,

1936
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:37,000
a lot of that parody stuff. So Pac-Man was heard on The Dr. Domeno Show, so it's not that this song was never out there.

1937
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:43,000
But because it was only ever played on the radio and not officially released on CD, you have a chance.

1938
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:48,000
And Dr. Domeno had to stop playing it after the third or fourth time, because guess what happened?

1939
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:55,000
The Beatles' lawyers sent a cease and desist about that whole thing. So Dr. Domeno had to stop playing that song.

1940
02:09:55,000 --> 02:10:01,000
But now, apparently, they've worked it out, I guess the same way that you can do Beatles music on Spotify now.

1941
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:02,000
It's just very useful.

1942
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:09,000
Yeah, some folks have changed their tune, I don't know. So now this song is going to be available on Weird Al's box set.

1943
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:15,000
So, very cool. As Joe and Hunter Matt points out, the squeeze box is in the shape of an accordion, I think.

1944
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:17,000
Well, that would be appropriate for Weird Al Yankovic, would it not?

1945
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:18,000
Mm-hmm.

1946
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:27,000
There it is. You can check out Weird Al's. If you want to hear the whole song, the Pac-Man parody, it's actually up on Vevo, which is basically their YouTube now.

1947
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:29,000
So, check that out.

1948
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:35,000
That is going to do it for the stories we have on deck tonight, so I think it's time to open up the Skype line.

1949
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:41,000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, if you want to give us a call and talk about anything we've talked about tonight,

1950
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:44,000
or maybe something we didn't get to tonight.

1951
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:49,000
We did talk about moments that you love in video games. You can share some of the love with us here on the Skype line if you want.

1952
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:52,000
Again, that's Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

1953
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:57,000
While we wait for the phone to ring, although I would always encourage, if you've never called the show before,

1954
02:10:57,000 --> 02:11:02,000
Echo 123 is a good place to call first to make sure your Skype connection is working.

1955
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:06,000
Loki, while we wait for some calls, do you have any last minute stories for us?

1956
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:15,000
I was just going to mention that the Dirt Rally game, they put out their VR DLC, so you can actually check that out now.

1957
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:21,000
And if you don't have Dirt Rally, you can actually pick it up with the VR expansion for like $37.

1958
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:26,000
So I'm kind of wondering if it's any good, because I'm kind of looking for more games for the PlayStation VR,

1959
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:32,000
and I do like racing games, although I'm not good at them, so I'd look for more of an arcade racing game.

1960
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:35,000
I'm curious to see how Dirt Rally is.

1961
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:39,000
Alright, we do have the phone ringing, so let's get to it.

1962
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:41,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

1963
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
Hi, this is Taro Koon.

1964
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:48,000
Hi Taro Koon, what's up? I don't recognize the name, are you a new caller to the show?

1965
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:53,000
Yeah, I'm a new caller, long time listener though, I love the show.

1966
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:56,000
Thank you, long time listener, first time caller, hooray. What's on your mind?

1967
02:11:56,000 --> 02:12:00,000
Yeah, I want to talk about the Switch.

1968
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:11,000
I don't like that Nintendo wants you to pay for a lot of things you might not care about in the Switch package.

1969
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:12,000
How so?

1970
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:23,000
Like, why not have a package that's almost like a Vita, where you don't have the dock for your house?

1971
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:31,000
I mean, maybe even one where it's just the tablet and it would be like, you know, $150 or something.

1972
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:40,000
I see, so you're kind of going back to some of those early, you might remember some of the early rumors about Project NX a few months ago is what we were all calling it.

1973
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:46,000
One of the earliest rumors was that it was going to be a separate handheld and television system that was one ecosystem.

1974
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:54,000
I'll tell you why they're not doing it. It's because, I know what you're thinking, your thought process is that they're charging $90 for that dock.

1975
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
There's not $90 worth of hardware in that dock.

1976
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:57,000
Exactly.

1977
02:12:57,000 --> 02:12:59,000
It's a piece of plastic.

1978
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:09,000
I don't know. I'm not as bothered by that whole thing. I can understand the whole thing to make it universal, but again, it's weird to me that they won't sell it as a portable system.

1979
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:16,000
They're not marketing it as a portable system when I think that most of its strengths are as a portable system, but that's just me.

1980
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:34,000
Yeah, and they could even have cheaper versions of the Joy-Cons or something, but then they would have problems selling games like 1-2 Switch and maybe they would split their market if they don't pack it all.

1981
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:38,000
Everybody has the same system in the box.

1982
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:46,000
So let me ask this question. Despite all this frustration with what Nintendo's doing, did you pre-order a Switch? Are you going to get one?

1983
02:13:46,000 --> 02:14:00,000
Oh, no. I really wish. I totally would get one and would pre-order one. I'm a big Nintendo fan. I figure I would get one and just buy the good games as they come out.

1984
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:13,000
As it is right now, I'm going to be waiting until holiday and they'll probably have more games and more online features and a full-featured console by that time.

1985
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:24,000
Some comments in chat over at live.vognetwork.com. YYR is saying, the problem with Switch without Joy-Cons is that you can't play it, but pro controllers won't play all games. The Joy-Cons are the standard controller.

1986
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:32,000
Yeah, I do sort of get that. It's kind of like the Wii in that regard. They do want to have the standard controller set or whatever.

1987
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:44,000
I guess it's kind of one of those things where at the end of the day, just have the games that justify it or have the features that gamers want to have.

1988
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:52,000
I don't know, a virtual console or online virtual console, something I've been talking about for a while, which sounds like we might finally be getting with the Switch.

1989
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
That part's exciting if nothing else.

1990
02:14:57,000 --> 02:15:05,000
Yeah, exactly. The moment they showed the HD rumble and all this stuff packed into the controllers, I'm like, yeah, that's impressive.

1991
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:14,000
But I don't think Zelda uses half of these things or Skyrim is going to tell you how many rocks your character is holding.

1992
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:22,000
Zelda will probably use all these features in one way or another. It might not be an intricate part of the game because, again, it has to exist on Wii U as well.

1993
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:31,000
But Nintendo really will go out of their way to justify their Nintendo ideas. And so I think it's more of a given you're going to see this on Zelda even.

1994
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:39,000
We'll see. I mean, we'll see. Nintendo's not telling us much, but we'll know in about a week and a half.

1995
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:41,000
Yeah.

1996
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:42,000
All right.

1997
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:45,000
I don't want to tie up your line here.

1998
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:50,000
No worries. I appreciate the call. Thanks for giving us your perspective. Take care and thanks for listening.

1999
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
Okay, thank you.

2000
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:53,000
Yep, have a good one.

2001
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:54,000
Have a great evening.

2002
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:59,000
Bye. All right. Thank you for the call. That was Taro-kun, if I remember right.

2003
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:08,000
OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype if you want to give us a call and say hello. Maybe you're very happy about the Switch and you can't wait for it.

2004
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:14,000
And you wish all of us would see it from your perspective. Feel free to call in and share. OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype.

2005
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:17,000
Any other last minute stories to check in on, Loki, while we wait?

2006
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:28,000
You'd mentioned, well, this is regarding that email that you kept getting about Liquid Sky, what that was.

2007
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:36,000
Somebody fucking signed me up for that. What is that? I get these emails and this has been happening to me a lot lately where on my personal email I'm getting signed up for things.

2008
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:46,000
You know, somebody's probably just fucking with me but I just, you know, you have to confirm your email address so I just keep saying no or deleting your spam.

2009
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:49,000
So this is the latest one I get and I'm like, what's this gaming thing?

2010
02:16:49,000 --> 02:17:00,000
It's like on live or something like that but with PC games. So you sign up and then you basically stream their games from their servers.

2011
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:05,000
Do you have to pay money for it? Somebody pay money and use my email? Can I borrow it?

2012
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:11,000
Well, they have like ads supported so that one's free and you get to play three hours a day.

2013
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:13,000
That's still a lot.

2014
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:22,000
Do you have any unused, I guess, credits roll over? And then there's also the pay-as-you-go which is $4.99 and then $9.99 a month.

2015
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:25,000
Yes, but can I play Zork on it like I could on GameTap?

2016
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:31,000
I have no idea. But apparently you have to have a beta key in order to redeem it to play that so I don't know.

2017
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:39,000
Interesting. So somebody's, oh my god, alright. Anyway, somebody did the same thing with a Microsoft account on my personal email this week.

2018
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:44,000
And my Microsoft account is actually through a secondary email that I have. So it's like somebody's trying to sign me up on my primary email.

2019
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:48,000
I'm like, nope. And so I went in and I deleted the account. I reset the password and deleted the account.

2020
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:55,000
It's like I don't get why websites let you sign up just using an email address without having to confirm said email address.

2021
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:59,000
Especially something like Microsoft. Jesus Christ. Very irritating.

2022
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:07,000
Anyway, Orange Launch Radio, last call. All one word on Skype or 1-877-GAME-OLR if you want to do it the old-fashioned way.

2023
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:12,000
Let's see. What was the other comment here I wanted to read in chat? It was about the Weird Al thing.

2024
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:17,000
Somebody had said, oh yes. Smexyvan, I hope I said that right. Smexyvan in chat said,

2025
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:23,000
Love, love Weird Al. Certain songs are ruined for me because of his parodies though. I can't listen to American Pie.

2026
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:30,000
That's true. Like, I can't listen to Happy by Pharrell Williams anymore without thinking of Tacky.

2027
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:38,000
I see that video of Weird Al and Margaret Cho and Aisha Tyler and all them dancing. That's all I see whenever I hear that song right now.

2028
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:43,000
Weird Al kind of does ruin songs. But did he ruin them though? Or did he make them better?

2029
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:51,000
Because I would argue in the case of Foil from that same album or even Word Crimes, he made those songs better.

2030
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:52,000
Word Crimes are pretty awesome.

2031
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:53,000
He made those songs better.

2032
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:55,000
That was an awesome video too.

2033
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:59,000
That's just my thought. Anyway, we do have one more call coming in over on the Skypline so let's get to it.

2034
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:01,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio. Who's this?

2035
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
Hello, you're on Orange Lawns Radio. Who's this?

2036
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
Hello, this is Smexyvan.

2037
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
Hi, Smexyvan. What's on your mind tonight?

2038
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:16,000
Wait, what is? This is like the night of new callers tonight. I like that. I'm all good with that. What's on your mind tonight?

2039
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:28,000
Oh, well, I was just reading. I was just listening and reading your comments on my Weird Al comments on the live chat.

2040
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:40,000
We must have a heck of a lag thing going on right now, but that's alright. What is on your mind? You hearing us talk about video games? What's your opinions on what we talked about tonight?

2041
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:48,000
Oh, well, sorry. Is that better with the...

2042
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:55,000
The volume's better, but we still have pretty horrific lag, but that's the joy of doing live radio. But we'll try to push through it.

2043
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:58,000
It is pretty chaotic. Well, I'm calling from Japan.

2044
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:05,000
That could do it. Calling from Japan might be a bit. Say hi to AkumaJP while you're there.

2045
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:11,000
Well, try to get your thoughts out for us here. We'll try to deal best we can with the lag. What's on your mind in gaming this week?

2046
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:28,000
Well, I was just calling on your comments on Weird Al. It wasn't that I meant that the songs were ruined for me by Weird Al's communities. It's actually really funny.

2047
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:35,000
We were driving, and American Pie came on the radio, and I was just laughing my ass off.

2048
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:45,000
Okay, I see. So, you were calling to clarify your comments and defend Weird Al Yankovic, which I understand Weird Al Yankovic should be defended.

2049
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:59,000
Look, I'm not a stupid nerd. I realize that Weird Al Yankovic is kind of like one of the popes of nerds. Do the nerds have a pope? If they do, it's probably Weird Al Yankovic, and I know better than to sacrilege him.

2050
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:08,000
But I'm just saying, he does have that tendency to do some songs that you can't hear the original anymore. All you hear is Weird Al versions.

2051
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:15,000
Like, Pharrell Williams' Happy isn't a bad song. I like that song, but I still hear Tacky. That's all I'm ever gonna hear.

2052
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
All I hear is Gump. I never hear Lump anymore.

2053
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:28,000
Exactly! It seems like that. But in the case of Word Crimes, I would actually argue he probably did make that song better, actually. I don't even want to hear the other one.

2054
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:45,000
With Word Crimes, there was actually a group of female law students that posted a parody of Word Crimes on YouTube. Oh god, it's gone. It was there for a week, and it was the funniest shit ever.

2055
02:21:46,000 --> 02:22:02,000
Pardon my language. I'm assuming the students themselves removed it, because I think they were a group of female law students, and they were in suits, and they instead had some hot boys in underwear.

2056
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:08,000
God, I wish I could remember the lyrics. It was a really good parody, but I liked that better than Weird Al's parody.

2057
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:10,000
Maybe they were worried about their careers getting...

2058
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:12,000
Yeah, that was probably it.

2059
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
I can see that. I can see that.

2060
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:19,000
But I'm sure it's hiding in some internet nest egg somewhere.

2061
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:24,000
Once on the internet, always on the internet. That's before y'all put videos on the internet. Be careful.

2062
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:32,000
But I was gonna say, wouldn't it be ironic if Weird Al had sued to get the parody taken down? That would be ironic. He would never do that. He would never do that, anyway.

2063
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:35,000
Yeah, I don't think so.

2064
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:46,000
We actually did a fun story. One of the Dragon Cons, my pal Travis Donovan from Under Station Live, rest in peace, who helped me get my start in this whole internet broadcasting thing.

2065
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:55,000
Not in broadcasting in general. I did that in college. Travis thinks I own that too, but I gotta keep him in check a little bit, but obviously I miss him and his show.

2066
02:22:55,000 --> 02:23:03,000
But the reason why I bring him up is that there was one Dragon Con when that Tacky came out and that whole album that Weird Al did.

2067
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:14,000
We actually did a party on the Thursday night that was called Tacky, where we all dressed up in Tacky outfits and we went around the hotels and the whole circuit at Dragon Con with that song blaring behind us.

2068
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:18,000
It was actually a lot of fun. Really, really ridiculous and stupid, but a lot of fun.

2069
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:22,000
Thankfully, nobody filmed it, though, because I don't need my mother seeing that outfit on the YouTubes.

2070
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:34,000
Exactly. All right. Let's see. Kaijuto in chat says this is a call from 2009 that finally caught up to 2017 because of the lag.

2071
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:41,000
Look, he's a long ways away and first time into the show. Anyway, I'm gonna go ahead and let you go, though, so we can wrap things up.

2072
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
But thanks for calling the show and thanks for listening.

2073
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:49,000
Wait for it. Wait for it.

2074
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:57,000
OK, well, hopefully the poor guy will hear this on the other end. Thanks for calling and listening. I hung up, though, because the lag, I guess, got too bad.

2075
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:04,000
But hopefully you'll hear that pleasant goodbye there. We do have the phone ringing again, so let's get to this. Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio. Who's this?

2076
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:06,000
Hey, Rob. What's up?

2077
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:10,000
Rama, we had all new callers tonight and then you had to call it. I'm just kidding.

2078
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:23,000
Yeah, well, if somebody wasn't busting balls about a particular snack product who got someone that got quite excited over what I posted when I first got it, well, maybe I wouldn't have had to call it.

2079
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:28,000
Yeah. Luckily, you did the right thing tonight and you bought my favor.

2080
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:31,000
And those are terrible.

2081
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:41,000
I had to put that fucking bag in the other room because I was eating them all and I was like, there's not going to be any left for Alan when he gets home, except he'll know that I ate them because I gained five pounds overnight.

2082
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:47,000
The stuff's made with real liquor, so you probably gained closer to seven.

2083
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:57,000
I already did, Rama. I had enough liquor last night, let me just say. I don't drink that much very often, but once every few months, I look out and last night was one of those nights.

2084
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
You went to a convention?

2085
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:03,000
No, no, that's great. It was a birthday party.

2086
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:04,000
Oh, close enough.

2087
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:15,000
Yeah, better yet, I went to a gay bar for a birthday party. I don't ever go out to gay bars anymore, it feels like, but I went out last night and I drank a lot. A lot. Rama was a lot.

2088
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:16,000
But was it tasty, tasty booze, though?

2089
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,000
God, yes, it was tasty, tasty.

2090
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:21,000
Then I don't see what the problem is.

2091
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:25,000
Me neither. All right, the hangover, that's the problem. All right, what's on your mind tonight, Rama?

2092
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:28,000
Nothing. I just came to bust your balls about the Stroopwafel.

2093
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:38,000
I like that we're getting these calls tonight where it's like, I just wanted to call in to defend Weird Al Yankovic, or I just wanted to call to defend the Stroopwafels or whatever it is.

2094
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:41,000
It was okay, but I think my expectations were too high.

2095
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:43,000
Maybe, I don't see how there is.

2096
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:49,000
It's kind of like when I hear about a Nintendo product coming out and then actually try it and then you just have to lower those expectations.

2097
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:53,000
Here's the thing. You need to also realize this. Loki never eats the food we give him.

2098
02:25:53,000 --> 02:26:00,000
Like, Darsaka can be like, I baked a delicious red velvet cake, da-da-da. Loki won't eat it because he's a picky eater, which is fine. I can be a picky eater too.

2099
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,000
You just don't like eating tons of cake.

2100
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:05,000
Yeah, but he ate the Stroopwafel.

2101
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:13,000
No, no, no. If you want Loki to eat a cake, you've got to have a bacon weave topping on the cake.

2102
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:23,000
No, you don't. No, you don't. Seriously, I was always on board with bacon on desserts and stuff, like bacon donuts, for example.

2103
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:29,000
Honestly, bacon donuts, all they did was give me the love maple donuts, and I don't need the bacon.

2104
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:36,000
The bacon does not enhance the donut that well. There's just some things. It's just bacon with a maple donut.

2105
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:39,000
And yeah, that's always good, because bacon is always good.

2106
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:46,000
But it doesn't necessarily make the donut any better. It's just it's bacon and the maple donut. And I love maple donuts. They're like my favorite now.

2107
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:52,000
I don't know, man. There's a convention I go to, and there is a farmer's market right next door.

2108
02:26:52,000 --> 02:27:02,000
And every year, I go there and I buy four bacon maple donuts, because they're not open on Sundays. And believe you me, they taste amazing with the bacon on it.

2109
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
What convention's this? I want to go to a convention.

2110
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
Farmer's market and anime convention.

2111
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,000
Farmer's market and anime convention.

2112
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:15,000
It's Zenkai Con, right in Lancaster County. You go outside the hotel, next block over, farmer's market.

2113
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:19,000
Wait a minute, Lancaster, Pennsylvania? Isn't that Amish country out there?

2114
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:20,000
Yes.

2115
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:23,000
Oh my god, so this is Amish farmer's market then?

2116
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:24,000
Yes.

2117
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:28,000
Oh shit. I bet that's pretty awesome.

2118
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:30,000
Oh yes indeed.

2119
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:34,000
You know the Amish are known for their maple bacon donuts.

2120
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:35,000
I know, right?

2121
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:43,000
I mean, you, see, when me and Muck, when we make the drive, you pass their theme park Dutch Wonderland as you're going there.

2122
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:59,000
That's amazing. What about, what was the place, oh my god, there was a theme park, and people may not know this, but I spend a lot of time, my old job, I spent at least six weeks in three different trips out in Allentown. Dorney Park. That was it.

2123
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:02,000
Dorney Park, Wild Water Kingdom is still there.

2124
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:16,000
It's still there. Yeah, there was a hotel right across the street, and I've spent like six weeks of my life in that hotel, always just longingly looking at the theme park, but being stuck at work. It was usually like, I don't even think the theme park was open. Was it one of those seasonal places?

2125
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:20,000
No, but are you sure it wasn't Sesame Place?

2126
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:25,000
No, it was not Sesame Place. I distinctly remember this theme park, because I could see it from my window.

2127
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:27,000
Yeah, it was definitely Dorney Park, Wild Water Kingdom.

2128
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:37,000
Yeah, yeah, that's fun, and I never went there in all the time that I spent out there. I never went to a damn theme park, but I think that was one of the trips I went to ate on the break, and I think we met up out there or something.

2129
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:42,000
Yeah, me and my friends, we took you to a traditional Jersey diner for food.

2130
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:51,000
Yes, yes, I remember that, and I was like, you guys, when you do this to me, I'm not going to go back and have jokes to tell about New Jersey, because I was like, you know what, New Jersey isn't so bad.

2131
02:28:51,000 --> 02:29:06,000
Look, everybody bags on Jersey, the landfill state, Chris Christie and all that, no matter what. Jersey has one saving face, and it's not Bruce Springsteen, it's the fact that Jersey is the biggest exporter of diners all over.

2132
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:15,000
No matter where you go in Jersey, you can walk two blocks, three blocks, whatever, you will find a diner, and if you don't like that one, there's another one you can go to.

2133
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:29,000
And they don't have diners in California like they have back east, they really don't. It's all chains, it's like Denny's, or now the new one is Big Bear, Black Bear? Big Bear? They're everywhere now, showing up everywhere.

2134
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:41,000
They're not bad, they're not the same. Mel's maybe is the closest thing to a diner, but even Mel's is kind of like, I don't know, they're all chains, Rama, it's not the same like it is back east.

2135
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:49,000
Believe you me, I know, there was a really good diner not too far from my house, but it closed about a couple of years ago, so, sad.

2136
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:57,000
Yeah, sad. sj100matt says, so basically what needs to happen is Rob needs to come back to New York. Well Rama, since you're on the line, I might as well address this.

2137
02:29:57,000 --> 02:30:05,000
So it turns out, y'all might remember, I have a friend that lives out in that area, she lived out in Connecticut, and that's one of the reasons I ended up in New York one of my trips out there.

2138
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:09,000
So I just found out she's getting married this October, so guess what that means?

2139
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:20,000
When in October? 13th question mark? God damn it, Rob! Is there a fucking convention then or something?

2140
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:26,000
No, I'm going to Colorado for somebody at the wedding. Rama, you son of a bitch!

2141
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:38,000
Hey, fuck you man, I got an invite, I got the most awesome save the date card ever. It wasn't to pick a picture of two people lovingly in each other's arms and eyes saying come to our wedding.

2142
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:49,000
No, it was just written on there with nice print that said save the date with awesome decorations on it, it's going to be a freaking party, it's going to be sci-fi themed, I am going.

2143
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:54,000
I haven't got wait, so that's funny, so you're going to be out here for a wedding as well?

2144
02:30:54,000 --> 02:31:10,000
No, Denver, but you know. Westward. Now I'm actually going through my text messages to see if I actually can find the text message that had the date in it because you're yelling at me so much that I want to make sure I'm right on this.

2145
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:19,000
I'm only yelling because I care and love you. I know you do. Hugs and kisses. Fuck, I can't find the text message now where she sent me the date.

2146
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:26,000
This is really important stuff to be talking about on our video game based radio show, but you know what?

2147
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:31,000
It's a special time of the show where we call it real life stuff.

2148
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:35,000
Exactly, and getting out to New York is a very important topic.

2149
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:40,000
Yes indeed, because there is this awesome bar I want to take you to and get you drunk.

2150
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:49,000
Alright, I will clarify the date. I'm going to find out. October 13th, getting married on Friday the 13th in October just sounds like something she'd do.

2151
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:54,000
My youngest sister got married on Halloween, so that doesn't surprise me in the least.

2152
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:59,000
But anyway, I'll find out the date and let you know, but it looks like I am going to have to go out to the East Coast this year.

2153
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:06,000
Like finally, I'm being forced to go out that way. Which you know, oh no, I so don't want to go, help.

2154
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:10,000
Well, yeah.

2155
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:16,000
Alright, well I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show my friend. I think everybody is sick of hearing us talk about our business.

2156
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:20,000
But you know what? Again, you bought my favorite tonight with Stroopwafel, so there you go.

2157
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:23,000
Alright, take care my friend.

2158
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:24,000
You too, stay fabulous.

2159
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:26,000
You too, bye.

2160
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:31,000
Alright, we're going to go ahead and close up the Skype line here.

2161
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:34,000
If you didn't get through and you wanted to talk to us, you can always send us an email.

2162
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:36,000
Participate at OrangeLawnTrader.com

2163
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:42,000
SSJ100Matt says in chat, it's been like 12 years since Rob was there. I had hair back then.

2164
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:44,000
Yeah, you and me both buddy. You and me both.

2165
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:48,000
It was a long time ago. I think my last trip out there was like 2008.

2166
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:51,000
So maybe not 12 years, but probably a good 10.

2167
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:54,000
So yeah, I got to get back out there for sure.

2168
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:58,000
But it's going to happen this year. I'm really going to have to go to this wedding.

2169
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:02,000
So I'll make it a point to visit New York City while I'm there.

2170
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:04,000
The big question is, will I be able to bring Alan?

2171
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:08,000
Because I'd really like to be able to bring Alan, but I'll have to get him on a plane for that.

2172
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:13,000
Alright, anyhow, that's going to wrap it up for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2173
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:16,000
Thank you guys so much for listening to our show this week.

2174
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:20,000
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, please tell a friend or five about the show.

2175
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:23,000
Help us spread the word because again, we are just a small independent podcast.

2176
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:28,000
We don't have a lot of big money or advertising dollars or things to spend on the show.

2177
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:30,000
Word of mouth really goes a long way.

2178
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:35,000
If you can't think of anyone to tell, you can always leave a nice five star review on a place like iTunes or Google Play podcast.

2179
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:39,000
Wherever you heard about this show, that word of mouth goes an awful long way.

2180
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:46,000
So yeah, would really appreciate all those kind words.

2181
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:53,000
So anyway, we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought here in studio.

2182
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:59,000
DarkSakura's final thought, she's not here, it would be, just kidding, feel better DarkSakura.

2183
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:03,000
I tease because I love. We'll try to save some Stroopwafel, I promise.

2184
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:05,000
Loki, your final thought tonight?

2185
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:09,000
My final thought is I was trying to work on programming this week.

2186
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:18,000
I did some programming. I was trying to, because work stuff, you know, because I mentioned gaming related.

2187
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:26,000
I don't, you know, really see, but we were having a PowerPoint presentation and PowerPoint's not that exciting.

2188
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:31,000
So I thought, hey, wouldn't it be awesome if I could make a game that could do a PowerPoint presentation sort of,

2189
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:35,000
or use the game as like an FPS PowerPoint type thing.

2190
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:41,000
But then I wanted to play Skyrim and then, you know, unfortunately that's what takes over, so.

2191
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:42,000
Of course, of course.

2192
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:47,000
But I have code on my screen that I wrote that maybe I will work on.

2193
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:48,000
Something.

2194
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:50,000
I just, my will is very weak.

2195
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:51,000
All right.

2196
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:52,000
I have no will.

2197
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:55,000
My final thought is three day weekend. Woo!

2198
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:58,000
So maybe I'll be doing some livestream tomorrow. I don't know.

2199
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:01,000
We're supposed to get another one of those storms of the century tomorrow, though.

2200
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:06,000
So I just want to, can I just get in the car and drive somewhere where it won't be raining?

2201
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:08,000
I guess not.

2202
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:10,000
Anyway, we'll be back in seven days to do it all over again.

2203
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:13,000
Thanks so much, you guys, for tuning into Orange Lounge Radio tonight.

2204

Appreciate it.

2205

Have a great week.

2206
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:16,000
Happy gaming.

2207
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:17,000
We'll see you in seven days.

2208

Bye.
