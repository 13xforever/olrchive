7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	21000	This week, show your F5 key some love as E3 opens ticket sales up to 1,000 attendees and probably 14,000 bots and scalpers.
21000	27000	There's plenty more news that respects your personal space, and we'll tell you about it starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36000	45000	It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 675 for this February the 12th of 2017.
45000	53000	My name is Rob Roberts, here to talk with you about video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle with my co-host and studio, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
53000	54000	Yo.
54000	55000	Hi, how are you, Jamie?
55000	56000	I'm okay.
56000	65000	Good. This is going to be really out of character for the show because we try to focus on games, although personal life stuff comes into character.
65000	70000	But I do need to get this out because we are a live show, so we watch things that are unfolding live.
70000	78000	I don't think we have any listeners that I know of in this part of California, but just north of here in an area where I actually lived for a few years,
78000	87000	they're evacuating the town of Oroville all the way down to Marysville right now, I think, which these are not giant cities in California.
87000	89000	Marysville is a pretty sizable city, so is Oroville.
89000	97000	It's, well, Oroville was evacuated, people are still on the road though. Marysville, Hallwood, Olivehurst, Plumas Lake, and Wheatland.
97000	105000	So what's happening is that California, you know, we've been in a drought for several years and we just got a crap ton of rain the past month.
105000	112000	And it's like a lot, a lot, a lot of rain. It was like, they say 200% of normal or something like that is all falling at once.
112000	119000	So what's happened is that Lake Oroville has filled up so much and I guess now all these problems are starting to show with the emergency spillway.
119000	123000	They just put out an alert at 4 o'clock that said the emergency spillway is going to break in 60 minutes.
123000	132000	And so they've evacuated all these. But if you just go to news.google and search for Oroville, O-R-O, which is gold in Spanish, Ville, just look for that.
132000	138000	And that's what we're kind of watching tonight. So Dark Soccer is kind of going to half watch that for us.
138000	144000	Just in case, because I know people in those areas from Ingress and just real life other stuff too.
144000	146000	But if any of our friends in the area are listening.
146000	149000	Yes, you need to leave. Now, turn off the show and go.
149000	151000	Well unless you're listening on your phone and are already in your car.
151000	152000	Then fine.
152000	156000	But the instructions have been to evacuate North Torchico.
156000	157000	So.
157000	158000	There you go.
158000	159000	Head for high ground.
160000	167000	Thoughts, sir. I hope it's just one of those things you're doing out of an abundance of caution and won't actually end up being chaotic.
167000	171000	Because the way it's sounding over the past 60 minutes, this is not good.
171000	173000	I'm going to point out something.
173000	179000	Having been from the Gulf Coast, this is what our taxes are supposed to go for.
179000	181000	Is to repair things and take care of it.
181000	185000	So don't ever want to hear anybody complaining about paying your taxes.
185000	193000	Because all of this evacuation that you're dealing with right now, these people are basically coming together to get people to safe ground.
193000	195000	This is why you pay taxes.
195000	196000	So.
196000	200000	To keep this stuff in good repair, which I remember the debate that went on over the levees in New Orleans.
200000	202000	And we know what happened there.
202000	206000	I just, I really hope they have the money to do what they need to do to keep people safe right now.
206000	209000	Exactly. And also, action does better than thoughts and prayers.
209000	212000	All right, Techmaster Loki, how are you tonight? Sorry.
212000	213000	I'm fine.
213000	215000	I want to make sure we got that out here at the top of the show, just in case.
215000	219000	I don't, again, we may have somebody in Marysville, though, I'm thinking.
219000	222000	Especially back from the DDR days, we definitely knew people up there.
222000	224000	So, anyway.
224000	225000	But how are you, Techmaster Loki?
225000	226000	I'm fine.
226000	227000	Yeah, how was your week?
227000	229000	Different, I should say.
229000	230000	Yeah, that's right.
230000	236000	You're kind of, your job isn't changing, but you're doing, like, one of those, like, what is it, like an internship at your job?
236000	237000	Sort of.
237000	238000	It's like a temporary thing?
238000	241000	Yeah, like a six-week rotation at an innovation lab.
241000	245000	But I know, and I know you can't, you can't really talk about the details, but...
245000	249000	There really aren't any details to talk about, but yeah, even if I had details, I can't really talk about them.
249000	254000	Just to say, though, it would be in, like, the realm of gaming, so there is something in that.
254000	259000	But, yeah, I can't really talk about it, because not really anything to talk about yet. It's more of just kind of research.
259000	263000	All right, well, I hope it's something in the future we'll get to know you had a part of.
263000	267000	Yeah, but it's cool, though, because I get access to the hacker lab down there, so I got to take a soldering class today.
267000	268000	Oh, fun!
268000	276000	Or yesterday, so I've finally been able to break myself of all my bad soldering habits, and now I can actually solder correctly, and I'm so happy about that.
276000	279000	Yeah, time to mod those old systems now.
279000	281000	Yeah, I can fix stuff now.
281000	284000	Yeah, hacker lab is pretty cool. I just went there for the first time.
284000	285000	They're opening one in Rancho.
285000	286000	Are they really?
286000	288000	And I'm super excited about that. I was like, yes!
288000	296000	I just went there for the first time a couple weeks ago, thanks to IGDA here in SAC, who asked me to host a panel, and I was tweeting about it.
296000	310000	I got to interview these guys that were with a company called T Cubed, which made this, it's not an actual mobile game, it's an actual physical game that they've made, and is gaining popularity very fast.
310000	314000	They're kind of having to deal with all this growth, so we're kind of talking about how that grew and all that stuff.
314000	324000	So that was my introduction to hacker lab, was doing a panel kind of about gaming, except it wasn't about the game itself, it was more about the business side of things, but it was still very fascinating.
325000	335000	Yeah, it's kind of nice, because during the few weeks that I'm down there, we basically have full access to that, so I can take any of the classes that they have for free, so that's kind of nice.
335000	342000	So, of course, I went there and I built a couple electronic kits, really basic shit.
342000	349000	But it was fun to be able to actually do it correctly. It's like, holy shit, I've been doing this completely wrong this entire time.
350000	363000	I doubt they even sell these anymore, because they're probably dangerous, but back in the 80s, when I was younger and I was a kid, they used to have these basic electronic boards where you could put the little wires in the springs and make very simple, light breadboards.
363000	370000	Yeah, is that still a thing that kids can do? Okay, I figured they probably caught fire to somebody's house, they don't sell anymore.
370000	374000	No, they've got a little fancier stuff now, they have almost blocks that you can build from.
374000	376000	I feel like I would still play with those as an adult.
376000	379000	You could still play with those as an adult, a lot of people prototype on that stuff.
379000	386000	You could make a radio transmitter with that stuff, it would only go from one bedroom to another for legal reasons, FCC reasons.
386000	393000	But I'm sure it would be very easy to mod if you wanted to do dirty, but not that I'd ever encourage that.
393000	399000	No, it was just kind of fun to be able to do that, so I took that class and, yeah, I can solder, so it's fantastic.
400000	408000	Half the problem I was having with soldering is my equipment is just shit, and because I was doing everything wrong, it made it even shittier.
408000	414000	I just need to buy a new soldering iron and some better equipment and I'm good to go.
414000	422000	Let's get into video game news. I know we've been talking about natural disasters and hacker lab, which at least is a little closer to gaming.
422000	426000	Let's get into some of the big topics this week. This has been a very busy week for gaming news.
426000	430000	The beginning of the year was pretty empty and I feel like we got a lot that hit this week, so let's jump right into it.
430000	435000	I think this is something that has been on a lot of people's minds this week as they've been reading gaming blogs,
435000	442000	but if you aren't already aware, E3 has made the announcement this week that they will be going public, partially.
442000	449000	So this is something that some people have been asking E3 to do for a long time, akin to what the Tokyo Game Show does,
449000	453000	but the way E3 has chosen to implement this is going to be a little bit different.
453000	462000	Starting, I think tomorrow is the big day, they are going to sell 15,000 tickets at a price of, I believe it is $150 for the first thousand,
462000	469000	and $250 for the rest, and that price, I think they said it was like $150 for the first day only,
469000	476000	but let's be real, those tickets will be gone tomorrow. They will be gone within 10 minutes tomorrow, if that.
476000	486000	But anyway, so that is going to be opened up to 15,000. That 15,000 is in addition to essentially who they're already letting in.
486000	494000	But, then this causes this question of, well, wait a minute, the LA Convention Center can only physically hold because of Fire Code,
494000	500000	so many people, so is this going to be a situation of these 15,000 people are coming from somewhere else?
500000	509000	I do remember last year, we seemed like we saw the ESA and E3 kind of dipping their toe in the water with this, with the whole like...
509000	510000	E4 All.
510000	511000	What was the thing they were doing like the...
511000	512000	E4 All.
512000	516000	No, no, no, no, no, no, not even that. I mean, that was a different type of experiment.
516000	524000	I'm talking about like the whole like, they invited the super users, the super consumers, pro, prosumers, I think they were called,
524000	531000	they invited to the show last year. Like, remember it was like, if you were an exhibitor, you could give like a hundred of your fans access to E3.
531000	536000	It sounded very much like the way we got into E3 the very, very, very first year we went,
536000	546000	because we had a company that we were promoting pretty heavily at the time that wanted to see us at E3 because they had relevant products, right?
546000	553000	So, and we haven't had friends that work at said company, so it kind of all worked out. I think they did that last year, if I remember right.
553000	559000	So, because I remember last year we were having these conversations about there's going to be more and more fans and we kind of see things heading this direction.
559000	563000	And why don't they just open it up to the public? But here we go. Now they're going to open up to the public.
563000	568000	So I'm assuming this is to partially replace said prosumer thing.
568000	576000	But I mean, if we at OLR had a hope to go to E3 at all, that would have been shot in the foot with this whole thing.
576000	580000	We're going to have to buy a ticket just like anyone else if we want to go at all.
580000	588000	I still feel the same, like nothing, my perception on E3 as opposed to a year or even two years ago hasn't really changed much.
588000	592000	I feel like the last times I've been to E3, I'm very fortunate to have gone.
592000	602000	I've had a great time at the shows I've gone to, but I started to see towards the end where it was like, I'm just getting like a press release live.
602000	610000	E3 is so much of a controlled environment and part of that control is just going online now.
610000	617000	It's being broadcast direct on Twitch TV, on YouTube, on Geoff Keighley's, whoever he's partnering with this year.
617000	621000	Which this year actually is the ESA he's partnering with. But anyway, Dark Saga.
621000	623000	EA is irrelevant.
623000	624000	EA electronic cards?
624000	625000	Not EA, sorry, E3.
625000	626000	E3 is irrelevant.
626000	627000	E3 is irrelevant.
627000	630000	There's a lot of people that say E3 is irrelevant. Why do you feel E3 is irrelevant?
630000	641000	It's been irrelevant for years because we would always get, I mean, especially with the advent of, you know, a more accessible Internet, like you were saying, we're getting it all the same time everybody else is.
641000	649000	You know, you may get some of the networking there, but that only really does you good if you are in a media capacity or in the industry.
649000	656000	Other than that, and for the people who were going for goodies, it's not even that good for that anymore either.
656000	660000	So it's just, there's no more joy to it.
660000	668000	I don't, I don't know if I would use the word irrelevant seems so strong, but I definitely still have some similar those feelings.
668000	672000	I think what's happened is that E3 has been diluted.
672000	682000	I think it's kind of one way I would put E3 has been diluted because E3 used to be the gamer Christmas and it still is to some extent because of all the press conferences.
682000	685000	Microsoft's still doing their thing. Sony's still doing their thing.
685000	693000	Nintendo, they started to drift from this a couple of years ago, but for all practical purposes, they still do their own thing around the time of E3.
693000	700000	So, I mean, E3 is still a holiday, so a weird nerd holiday in some events.
700000	705000	But what I mean by the whole diluted thing is that E3 was like that one time a year when that happened.
705000	710000	Well, that went away because now, you know, let's take Sony for example.
710000	715000	Sony's done very well with their PlayStation Expo that they do in December.
715000	724000	So which is coincidentally, but probably not exactly six months out from E3 is when Sony tends to do their other show, the PlayStation Expo now.
724000	730000	And they have a great success with that and getting out a lot of big messages and getting a lot of press during that time.
730000	750000	And I think Nintendo, part of the reason they changed their tune significantly a couple years ago to the Nintendo Directs and what they were doing is that they found that taking their message directly to their very rabid fan base was going to be more beneficial than having just the cynics show up to play the games.
750000	758000	See, that's why I think that it's irrelevant now. You don't need it anymore. It's redundant. It's redundant.
758000	767000	It's not necessary to have it anymore. It's really just random hype fest. And now you can get these things directly from the developers.
767000	780000	It's probably more cost effective for the developers themselves to do their own little gig rather than have a big, you know, presentation and have to compete with the other developers there on the floor.
780000	788000	If you do it yourself, you control the output, you control the cost, and you control the message.
788000	799000	Let's go to our live chatters. Hi, guys. We do tape live, of course, every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
799000	808000	And we do have, you know, again, we don't have 50,000 people that listen to this show, but the group that we do have that shows up week after week, we love you guys.
808000	815000	You're our Sunday night fam. Thank you guys for being here as always. And let's get some of your comments read in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
815000	829000	SHO 100 Matt says, Pax sells out in 20 minutes. This will sell out in five, if that. Ain't that the truth. Pax fits way more than 15,000 people and they've been having ticket issues and scalpers.
829000	841000	You know, I loved Jason's tongue in cheek intro tonight. It was a little bit sassy, but I think it was accurate. You're going to have maybe a thousand actual people that want to go to E3 getting tickets and then 14,000 scalpers.
842000	856000	It's all right. After they go to E3, they're not going to want to go to E3. Probably. I mean, I mean, what we've said, you know, honestly, like having gone to it, a lot of the stuff, it seemed like every year more and more gets behind closed doors.
856000	870000	And you don't think if you got that general mission pass that you're going to see any of that stuff. You may get to play some games, but honestly, I feel I get more information out of just watching the stuff online and hearing, seeing the press releases,
870000	875000	because while you're there, you miss a ton of stuff because it's just a lot to take in.
875000	883000	Right. Well, I'm, you know what, and I don't want to keep like poo-pooing on the E3 and my experiences and the reasons why I chose to stop going to E3.
883000	892000	Like if you're out there and you're listening and you're going to fight for one of these 15,000 tickets, and if you do end up winning one of the spots and you get to go or what have you, have a great time.
892000	906000	And I would be very curious what the show is like, because regardless, as desperate as this move feels to me to keep E3 that big event thing that is going to get people talking about or what have you,
906000	920000	it's going to be a year of transformation for E3, akin to when they went to the airport for those two years and then when they left the airport, or even if you want to go way back when they went to LA in the first place from Atlanta.
920000	927000	I mean, this is going to be a big change for E3. So, I mean, for better or for worse, it could be a very different show this year because of it.
927000	941000	And maybe I'll be like, shit, I should have really tried to go this year. But, you know, I do have to kind of weigh in my mind, well, the money that it costs to, because again, E3, they didn't put it on a weekend.
941000	949000	Even though they're opening it up to the public, they didn't put it on a weekend now. So, you're going to have to give up your whole week if you want to travel to E3 and do all that stuff.
949000	963000	Just a reminder, too, this is the show that we're talking about. Everything else that happens at E3, the parties, the press conferences, those are separate from this thing that you're looking at.
963000	967000	Also EA and anybody else that may be around.
967000	976000	Oh, yeah, we haven't heard of that. If EA is going to do their thing across the street or if they're going to, because of this transformation, maybe EA is going to come back. I don't know.
977000	980000	Or Activision, I think Activision was separate from it.
980000	988000	Activision hasn't been for a little while. Well, Activision is a weird area. Activision has been on the show floor, but they still rent the space upstairs to invite...
988000	990000	They also still have their stuff in other booths, maybe?
991000	1005000	Well, sure, yeah. Things would show up in Microsoft or Sony's booth, but they still have their space upstairs for their invite only really early, early announcements that are going to be weeks and months down the line under non-disclosure agreements.
1005000	1008000	Things that aren't necessarily to be announced the week of the show.
1008000	1019000	But anyway, if you guys get tickets, cool. I'll be curious to see how the show is. I kind of feel like the ticket sales are going to be a complete and utter clusterfuck tomorrow.
1019000	1023000	But we'll see. Maybe I'll be wrong. Maybe those that are going will have a great time.
1024000	1028000	I know our pals over at GameBooey.org, we're talking about possibly using this to go to the show.
1028000	1036000	And so if they're able to go, I think I would fucking love to hear Spike's perspective, because he went to E3 years ago.
1036000	1040000	And so if he gets to go again under this, I would love to hear his perspective on it.
1040000	1044000	I don't see why our friends from Electric Sisterhood wouldn't try to go again.
1044000	1048000	E3 was the one time of year I could only ever see those guys.
1048000	1051000	So if they get to go this year, I'd be very curious to see what they think.
1051000	1055000	And their thoughts on the show are different than mine, and that's cool.
1055000	1061000	I just look at it and go, okay, so the week I could spend doing E3, I could also go to MAGFest.
1061000	1065000	Or I could go to a smaller IndieCon or DragonCon or something else.
1065000	1070000	I'm just like, you know, I only have so much money. I would rather spend it on this right now.
1070000	1074000	I do want to take time off, though, so I can watch the press conferences on the couch with popcorn.
1074000	1075000	Do you?
1075000	1077000	Because that's the best.
1077000	1080000	So there is still that holiday event to it.
1080000	1084000	I love the press conferences. I mean, they're fun to make fun of.
1084000	1087000	Ubisoft's going to be Ubisoft.
1087000	1095000	But no, I like all that stuff, but my god, I don't want to go back there and play those games.
1095000	1100000	Unless I had something like I really, really wanted to play, you know, like a New Saints Row or something.
1100000	1102000	But that's not going to fucking happen.
1103000	1112000	I don't know. I'm fine with watching the videos and watching the livestreams and just living vicariously through that.
1112000	1119000	I'm going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Dungeonbuster points out, no panels, no game rooms, no contests.
1119000	1121000	It's a straight up trade event.
1121000	1128000	Yeah, I mean, again, unless they are going to announce something we haven't heard yet, E3 is not going to be like PAX.
1128000	1135000	And with as hard of a time as I've given PAX and its growing pains and its issues and some of the reasons why I don't go to PAX either.
1135000	1143000	I still think that, like, I think what a lot of people probably are expecting to see at E3, they're probably really going to see at PAX.
1143000	1144000	You know what I mean?
1144000	1156000	So I just... E3 is not going to have classic gaming rooms or jammed spaces or, you know, again, unless they decide to announce some things later on.
1156000	1163000	We have heard, and I'll mention this, there's some type of partnership with Geoff Keighley, because everybody wants to partner with him.
1163000	1167000	That he's going to do some type of panel leading thing.
1167000	1172000	So I guess they're trying to come up with where can we encourage these 15,000 peoples to go.
1172000	1184000	But again, in this day and age of these conventions live streaming their panels online, do I need to go all the way to E3 just to see a panel?
1184000	1190000	I'm not sure. So, we'll see what happens with that.
1190000	1202000	Loki, any thoughts on how E3 might change this year in contrast to years past?
1202000	1204000	Lines might be longer.
1204000	1206000	Ain't that the truth.
1206000	1211000	I mean, that's all I can think of. If they're trying to keep it packed, it's just that the lines are long.
1212000	1219000	I don't know. I don't know what the advantage is for them other than making up lost revenue.
1222000	1234000	I think what's going to be interesting to see happen is that, you know, you've got these 15,000 people that will be going to E3, and we do live in an age of social media everywhere.
1235000	1245000	Is the ESA trying to do this to try to get the buzz on that level? The more like homegrown hashtags and social media trends?
1245000	1247000	But do they need that?
1247000	1256000	I was going to say, maybe because I'm ingrained in that stuff, but I think that it seems like the buzz is already there.
1256000	1262000	It's not like people... I mean, people that don't know what E3 is, they probably don't give a shit about what E3 is.
1262000	1266000	It's not like, oh, there's a gaming convention that tells me about games in the industry and stuff.
1266000	1270000	I don't think that people really are going to care if that's...
1270000	1278000	And if they wanted to do that, why didn't they just open it up again to more independent journalists to be able to go?
1278000	1280000	And people that at least have an active interest in that.
1280000	1286000	And I just want... I'm not... I still feel the same about E3. I'm not going to go, even if they were to do that.
1286000	1289000	So I don't want you thinking, like, oh, Rob's just bitter because he doesn't...
1289000	1306000	It's not that, but why not try to invite 15,000 people that want to be able to write about it and promote it in their various YouTube, podcasts, blog, and all that type of stuff?
1307000	1315000	I don't... Why just 15,000 people that want to be able to say they went to E3?
1315000	1323000	They're just probably trying to make up the numbers. Maybe they feel that that's where they projected that they're going to be falling under that amount.
1323000	1328000	And this way they can make it up instead of giving out free passes like they may have done in the past.
1328000	1333000	Although I would assume that those tickets have to be covered by the companies that are going.
1333000	1335000	I mean, it's just... It's revenue for them.
1337000	1341000	All right. Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, S2100Matt says,
1341000	1346000	To be honest, I wouldn't be surprised if you see fewer demos at E3 on the floor.
1346000	1351000	Most of the demos for the new games that people want to see will be appointment only or specially monitored demos.
1351000	1352000	That was already happening.
1352000	1355000	That was part of the problems. That was already happening.
1355000	1357000	And it was like there's less and less.
1357000	1371000	And, you know, I just like I kind of got sick of the whole wait in a line to go in a theater to watch somebody else play a walkthrough that was already published on YouTube hours before you got in the line.
1371000	1379000	Like that was the... If I could put my finger on like one or two sentences on why I don't go to E3 anymore, that is it.
1379000	1381000	That is why I don't bother with E3 anymore.
1381000	1382000	That and Paris Hilton.
1383000	1386000	No, I still went for a couple of years after the Paris Hilton year.
1386000	1388000	But that's the whole reason.
1388000	1394000	Why would I fucking stand in a line to go in a theater to watch what you just watched on YouTube two hours ago?
1394000	1396000	And Capcom fucking hates us.
1396000	1398000	Well, that's a whole other issue.
1398000	1400000	Oh, they're not the only ones, Loki. Come on.
1400000	1404000	Come on. Remember when we had the threatening emails from Namco? Come on.
1404000	1406000	Where have you been?
1406000	1407000	All right. Anyway.
1408000	1414000	CMYK in chat says, remember that year when you could download demos of games shown off at E3?
1414000	1416000	Exactly. That was awesome.
1416000	1417000	That was the best.
1417000	1421000	Exactly. That was thankfully Capcom. Thank you, Capcom.
1421000	1428000	Because they did MotoGP06 and The Lost Planet and there was one other one, but I don't remember what it was.
1428000	1431000	But yeah, that was awesome.
1431000	1438000	That's what I think they should do is like put out a demo, release it out there so people can experience that shit at home.
1440000	1441000	Fucking great idea.
1442000	1443000	But they're not going to do that anymore.
1446000	1448000	All right. Anything else you want to say on E3, Dark Sakura?
1449000	1450000	Fuck it.
1451000	1457000	Are you going to watch it at all though? Do you still partake in the news conferences and all that stuff?
1457000	1460000	Not really. I don't like getting disconnected every five minutes.
1461000	1464000	It's true. There's all the bandwidth problems.
1464000	1470000	I just let someone else live stream it. I mean, not the stream, but live tweet it and then I get what I want.
1470000	1471000	Yeah.
1471000	1472000	And I'm happy.
1472000	1473000	Okay.
1473000	1477000	And I'll have to listen to people droning on and on when I could be doing other stuff.
1477000	1480000	You just want the bullet points. Like just show me the ones like PowerPoints.
1480000	1482000	Exactly. Give me the meeting minutes.
1484000	1488000	That's how Dark Sakura is going to approach E3 in the future. Just give me a copy of the minutes.
1488000	1490000	I'm not going to show up to the meeting. Just send me the minutes.
1490000	1495000	It's like, I don't have time for this. I am needed over at Bethesda right the fuck now.
1496000	1500000	Give it to me. And here's my email. Send me the minute.
1500000	1502000	I like that. Just send me the bullet points and the action items.
1503000	1506000	My card is just going to say IDGAF minutes, please.
1507000	1509000	You could probably, maybe you could ask.
1509000	1511000	I want it as a keynote presentation.
1511000	1519000	Why don't you get some of the IGDA cards from our pals at SacIGDA and just add the letter F on it.
1520000	1523000	Of course, they might not appreciate that. And hopefully they're not out there listening.
1523000	1525000	Wasn't it like IGDA?
1525000	1526000	Yeah, it is.
1526000	1529000	So I give don't a fuck. Yoda.
1529000	1530000	Yeah, you're just Yoda.
1534000	1541000	All right. Let's get into our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.
1541000	1544000	So we'll start with you Dark Sakura. What types of video games have you been playing this week?
1544000	1545000	Wow.
1545000	1546000	Lots and lots of wow?
1546000	1547000	Lots and lots of wow.
1548000	1558000	I really, Dan finally gave up on Mega Man 2.5D because it's, it's, it's really, it can be a pain.
1558000	1563000	But there's a new release of it out now, a new patch version, so might redownload it.
1563000	1571000	But it's really just been, I've been so busy this week that I just, I just played wow.
1571000	1576000	Oh, oh, oh, wait, wait, wait. No, I've started playing Bust A Move again on my iPhone.
1576000	1578000	I fucking love Bust A Move.
1578000	1580000	Whoa, whoa, whoa. Bust, oh, wait. Sorry, I'm thinking-
1580000	1581000	Puzzle Bobble.
1581000	1584000	Yeah, sorry. I got excited for a minute.
1584000	1587000	But I super, super love Puzzle Bobble.
1587000	1593000	And I have been playing the crap out of it again on this like everlasting challenge mode.
1596000	1599000	You just play and play and play and play until you just can't play anymore.
1599000	1601000	And that's how I like to play that game.
1601000	1603000	So it's been pretty fun.
1603000	1610000	And, um, yeah, I think really that's it because, you know, we played something else.
1611000	1612000	I don't remember.
1614000	1615000	All right.
1615000	1616000	Not much.
1616000	1617000	All right, well, if it's that important-
1617000	1619000	Oh yeah, Link to the Past, duh.
1620000	1622000	How could you forget about Zelda?
1622000	1623000	Old.
1625000	1626000	Old.
1626000	1627000	Oh, because you're old?
1627000	1628000	No.
1628000	1630000	That's just the reasons. It's because of reasons.
1630000	1632000	I don't care. I need the minutes.
1632000	1633000	All right.
1633000	1634000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1634000	1639000	So my gaming week consisted of, um, actually some things I haven't played normally.
1639000	1648000	Um, so we did, uh, as part of our immersion project into what I'm doing at, you know, my side job thing right now.
1648000	1651000	Is, uh, we had a Smash Melee tournament.
1652000	1653000	Oh, you mentioned this last week.
1653000	1655000	That you were going to participate in this.
1655000	1656000	Yes, I was going to participate in this.
1656000	1662000	The issue, though, with it is, it was a Smash Melee tournament on emulators.
1662000	1669000	Which sucked ass, because the, uh, input lag was just fucking horrible.
1669000	1671000	So I did my best. I got third place.
1671000	1672000	So that was all right.
1672000	1674000	That's still not bad for somebody.
1674000	1676000	Didn't you say last week you don't really ever play?
1676000	1677000	I don't normally play.
1677000	1678000	There you go.
1678000	1680000	The guy that- there's only three gamers in our group.
1680000	1681000	So that's why I got third.
1681000	1684000	Oh, so you got third place out of the three gamers. Good job.
1684000	1687000	So, I mean, but we played against people that, you know, worked down there.
1687000	1692000	And, uh, you know, the one guy who won, he plays Smash all the time.
1692000	1693000	So it's like, okay, well shit.
1693000	1694000	You know, there's no way it would be that.
1694000	1696000	And everyone fucking horrid Peach.
1696000	1700000	Just like, it was fucking a Peach fest all over.
1700000	1701000	So I played Kirby.
1701000	1702000	Peach is a good character.
1702000	1704000	I played Kirby and then I did Mario.
1704000	1707000	Because they didn't have any of their characters unlocked, so.
1707000	1712000	And I didn't pick a fast character like Fox because, like I said, input lag was shit.
1713000	1716000	And so you'd just be flying off the goddamn side of the map.
1716000	1717000	Super easy, so.
1717000	1719000	That's a little silly they used emulators, though.
1719000	1720000	Yeah.
1720000	1722000	So, anyways.
1722000	1727000	Um, and then I, you know, did some PlayStation VR stuff because I was showing it off.
1727000	1731000	So I got to play a little bit of, um, Until Dawn, Rush of Blood.
1731000	1732000	Still love that game.
1732000	1734000	It's just such a great game.
1734000	1737000	Um, I got to try a little bit.
1737000	1742000	Um, I played the demo of, um, what was that, Eve Valkyrie again.
1742000	1743000	Still love that demo.
1743000	1745000	Not paying $60 for the game, though.
1745000	1748000	And then, um, let's see.
1748000	1752000	I also, of course, played a ton of Skyrim Remastered.
1752000	1756000	Um, I don't know if I mentioned it before that I completely restarted my game.
1756000	1758000	So before I was playing with a ton of mods and it was ridiculous.
1758000	1761000	Now I'm playing without mods and just playing through the game.
1761000	1766000	Of course, I've already power leveled my character using glitches that were in the vanilla game.
1766000	1767000	So I'm already done there.
1767000	1772000	So back up to Godlike again and just going to run through all the different quests that are in there.
1772000	1775000	But I kind of like it because it's a little bit more of a challenge.
1775000	1777000	So I'm really enjoying that still.
1777000	1780000	And Skyrim, like, infinite amount of replayability.
1780000	1784000	So, um, looking forward to that and still playing quests I haven't played before.
1784000	1787000	Even though I've played the game, like, several times.
1787000	1792000	Um, and then, of course, a little bit of Ingress just because now I'm working in a completely different area.
1792000	1794000	So, you know, all those uniques and stuff.
1794000	1796000	And it's also concentrated down there.
1796000	1801000	But because of that, it's also so chaotic that people just drive by everything.
1801000	1802000	So, I don't know.
1802000	1804000	But, yeah, that's pretty much it.
1804000	1805000	Awesome.
1805000	1808000	Um, my gaming week was very potpourri.
1808000	1809000	I played a little bit of everything.
1809000	1812000	Of course, I'm still continuing to play, like, Final Fantasy XIV, my old standbys.
1812000	1814000	Overwatch, I still play.
1814000	1818000	Um, even though we were fighting for a little bit over the capture the flag thing,
1818000	1821000	I just stopped playing capture the flag and got a lot better.
1821000	1823000	Um, I still love me some Mystery Heroes.
1823000	1827000	That's kind of my go-to mode right now when I play with Alan or some of our other friends.
1827000	1832000	Um, uh, otherwise, I played a little bit of Rez this week.
1832000	1834000	The newer one on PlayStation 4.
1834000	1836000	Because I still was trying to get Area X unlocked.
1836000	1838000	Uh, because I need to get to that.
1838000	1840000	But then I got distracted, like, actually just playing through the game.
1840000	1842000	So, uh, that was fun.
1842000	1849000	Uh, and then, um, I also on PlayStation 4 was playing, uh, randomly Pac-Man Championship Edition 2 again.
1849000	1853000	And just playing, you know, just some stuff in my backlog on PlayStation 4.
1853000	1858000	And then the other night, extremely randomly, very extremely randomly, um,
1858000	1863000	you know Alan is super into Morrowind and Skyrim, right? Elder Scrolls, right?
1863000	1865000	He played Skyrim, like, a lot.
1865000	1866000	Yeah.
1866000	1868000	And then he just finished Morrowind, right?
1868000	1871000	So, um, and he, you know, likes to mod the shit out of that.
1871000	1873000	So, he just moved on now.
1873000	1875000	I think he's getting ready to start Oblivion.
1875000	1880000	Although, I feel like for the past three nights, he's been setting up his mods in Oblivion.
1880000	1883000	He hasn't been playing Oblivion, he's just been setting up his mods in Oblivion.
1883000	1886000	So he can play the game the way that he wants to.
1886000	1893000	But then that whole talk kind of made me realize, like, oh yeah, Oblivion recently went backwards compatible on Xbox One.
1893000	1895000	And I never installed it.
1895000	1899000	So, and then, one of our mutual friends was over here on Friday night.
1899000	1904000	And is also, that friend happens to also be a big fan of Elder Scrolls and that whole series.
1904000	1908000	And so it was like, alright, let's just play Oblivion on Xbox One.
1908000	1910000	Let's do, like, go back through the game.
1910000	1913000	Because I wanted to see, you know, I haven't played that game in so long.
1913000	1917000	I was like, ooh, TV with a high refresh rate and then the, you know, whatever.
1917000	1924000	So, I gotta say, graphically, it still holds up pretty well for an Xbox 360 game that plays on Xbox One.
1924000	1928000	And, you know, we played through it with the whole little introductory dungeon getting out.
1928000	1933000	I would still like to see, like, the remastered versions of Oblivion and Morrowind.
1933000	1937000	Because Morrowind wasn't on console. I think, was it on Xbox, the original Xbox?
1937000	1939000	The original Xbox, yeah.
1939000	1943000	So, I mean, that would be cool to see, like, a remastered version, like, in the Skyrim engine or something like that.
1943000	1945000	Yeah, yeah, but I don't think those are going to be.
1945000	1947000	Well, there is the whole, I don't know if you know.
1947000	1949000	The mod, yeah, the mod that they're making.
1949000	1952000	Well, no, not just that, but the whole Elder Scrolls Online.
1952000	1954000	Their next expansion is Morrowind.
1954000	1958000	So, I'm not, I mean, again, obviously it's not going to be the exact same thing.
1958000	1960000	But it's going to be revisiting a lot of that.
1960000	1962000	Elder Scrolls Online is actually pretty fun.
1963000	1965000	I've been playing a little bit of it because it's free.
1965000	1968000	Well, I mean, not the game, you pay the game.
1968000	1969000	Guild Wars style.
1969000	1972000	But I've had a really good time playing and it's really pretty.
1972000	1973000	Yeah.
1975000	1977000	Any, how far have you gotten?
1977000	1979000	Not terribly far.
1979000	1984000	I was going to play with Tiara for a bit and I just kind of lapsed out of it.
1984000	1986000	Which, by the way, there is an update.
1986000	1987000	Oh, for Elder Scrolls?
1987000	1989000	No, for Auroville.
1989000	1990000	Oh.
1990000	1993000	They're still getting two inches of spillage over the dam.
1993000	1995000	Or over the auxiliary wall.
1995000	2000000	But it's slowed down and they think they might be able to plug it instead of it breaking.
2000000	2001000	Oh, thank gosh.
2001000	2002000	Yeah, so just thought I would do it.
2002000	2003000	Oh, fingers crossed.
2003000	2008000	They're draining out of the main spillway and they said that it's going to be below that line pretty soon.
2008000	2009000	Oh, good, good, good, good, good, good.
2009000	2011000	All right, fingers crossed.
2011000	2012000	I was sorry to interrupt.
2012000	2017000	I was going to mention, you know, my prize for winning third place was, they had really stupid prizes.
2017000	2018000	Yeah.
2018000	2020000	I got this book, Dancing with Cats.
2020000	2022000	That sounds like the best book ever.
2022000	2023000	That's an awesome prize.
2023000	2024000	Well, yes.
2024000	2025000	It was this.
2025000	2029000	They had a UFO detector, which I don't know what that was, but it looked like some electronics.
2029000	2031000	And then they had a yodeling pickle.
2031000	2032000	What?
2032000	2034000	It's a pickle that yodels.
2034000	2035000	What?
2035000	2036000	That sounds awesome, too.
2036000	2039000	Ragenator in chat is asking over at live.vognetwork.com,
2039000	2046000	speaking of the Elder Scrolls games, Sky, have you seen people installing triple X mods on Skyrim and streaming it on Steam?
2046000	2050000	The first part of that question, yes, I see it happening in my house.
2050000	2055000	I don't need to load it on Steam or Twitch or any of that stuff.
2055000	2058000	I can just watch my husband do it.
2058000	2062000	So I've never gone looking for it on Steam.
2062000	2069000	It gets awkward after you kill some of these old hag witches in there and they have beautiful breasts underneath.
2069000	2071000	It's like, okay, that doesn't fit.
2071000	2072000	That's just weird.
2072000	2081000	It was explained to me that there is a mod that alters the titty mod so that old ladies have more realistic old lady titties.
2081000	2083000	After a while, it was just kind of...
2083000	2084000	It just turned dark soccer.
2084000	2085000	It was just weird.
2085000	2087000	The biggest sigh not on her mic.
2087000	2089000	I need vodka in this coffee.
2089000	2092000	I have Stroopwafel in the fridge.
2092000	2095000	I have a whole bottle at home.
2095000	2097000	And Dungeonbuster in chat says you don't need those mods.
2097000	2101000	You just need Conan Exiles, which we talked about last week.
2101000	2102000	That was still the funniest thing.
2102000	2109000	Okay, when I've been wanting to cheer myself up this week, I've gone back and looked at the animated gifs of them expanding the Wang.
2109000	2113000	And it has been the funniest thing because it's so unnatural.
2113000	2115000	I really, really, really...
2115000	2121000	We need to start a GoFundMe or something to get the money to buy Dark Sakura, Conan Exiles, just so she can stream it.
2121000	2126000	Just so I can just not see her get past character creation because she won't be able to stop giggling.
2126000	2127000	I will do it the whole time.
2127000	2129000	I will laugh so much.
2130000	2131000	I want this...
2131000	2133000	It'll be weep, weep, weep, weep.
2135000	2138000	I would have to break my rule and play a dude just for that.
2138000	2140000	I'm gonna make him skinny.
2140000	2142000	Like, skinny.
2142000	2144000	Okay, you go ahead.
2144000	2154000	I don't know if you remember way back, and I don't know if it was tool controls or analog controls or something like that where they have the breast movement mod or whatever with dead or alive.
2154000	2158000	Remember where you can actually jiggle the boobs depending on how you move the controls.
2158000	2165000	I remember some game you were playing during OLR in the first years. There was some, like, boob slapping game.
2165000	2167000	Oh yeah, I remember that too.
2167000	2171000	Your now wife was obsessed with that game.
2171000	2172000	Was she? I don't remember.
2172000	2173000	Of course she was.
2173000	2176000	But yeah, I remember that. That was kind of silly.
2176000	2179000	And that was like a rhythm game too.
2179000	2183000	So yeah, like, you know, it just spins, bounces, and like swings.
2183000	2186000	Yes, you had to spin the booby or bounce the booby.
2186000	2191000	What was the name of that game? That should be the classic game of the week. It's got to be ten years old.
2191000	2194000	Send it to Dark Soccer for consideration.
2194000	2201000	But yeah, so they had that, so now they just need to have that kind of control over the penis in Conan Exiles.
2201000	2204000	Where, you know, right analog sticks just flopping that shit around.
2204000	2206000	Fair is fair. Fair is fair.
2206000	2207000	I think so.
2207000	2212000	Alright. So yes, so anyhow, before we talked about the booby game I was watching, I played Oblivion.
2212000	2218000	So anyway, the other game I spent an unhealthy amount of time playing this week, ya'll ready for this?
2218000	2220000	Pokemon Go.
2220000	2222000	Oh yeah, I was playing that too.
2222000	2226000	Because the Valentine's event is going on right now with the whole double candy.
2226000	2228000	Did you find a Porygon anywhere?
2228000	2229000	Yes.
2229000	2230000	Where?
2230000	2231000	Downtown Sacramento.
2231000	2232000	Girl.
2232000	2233000	JN 16th.
2233000	2234000	I don't have one yet.
2234000	2238000	Do it before the Valentine's Day event is over.
2239000	2245000	There's late at night after everything shuts down for the state, just pull over to the side of the road or get a wingman to be with you.
2245000	2247000	I should have done it while I was downtown last night.
2247000	2253000	That's what I did. One of my Ingress buddies and I, we were like we're gonna go play Ingress and Pokemon Go and then we didn't play any Ingress.
2253000	2259000	We just played Pokemon Go because we went downtown and we started seeing like all the rare spawns like Porygon were coming up.
2259000	2261000	And I got Hitmonlee and Hitmonchan.
2261000	2263000	I was just distracted by all the queens last night.
2264000	2270000	We watched a drag show last night and it was really busy at faces.
2270000	2278000	So yesterday, one of my longest friends I've known for a long time but we haven't hung out a lot in the past couple of years.
2278000	2282000	It's my old roommate from when this show was in the garage with the Christmas lights. Remember that?
2282000	2287000	So he is really into Pokemon Go. Which kind of surprised me when I found that out.
2287000	2292000	I mean I knew he was always like, he's one of those things like, I don't know if he would call himself a gamer.
2292000	2297000	But like, I remember like old school Final Fantasy games he got obsessed with.
2298000	2301000	And now it's Pokemon Go that he's all into, right?
2301000	2306000	So we went to San Francisco and we had planned this trip for a couple of weeks.
2306000	2309000	We were just gonna go during the day because I had to host Rocky Horror last night.
2309000	2316000	And so we just went in the morning and we walked down to Pier 39 and it just happened to be double candy weekend, right?
2316000	2323000	I earned about 450 Magikarp candies in the course of the trip.
2323000	2324000	Holy crap.
2324000	2326000	So I have a Gyarados now. That was easy.
2326000	2330000	Also for the very first time I finally got a fucking Grimer.
2330000	2331000	Woo!
2331000	2338000	Cause that's the one I was like, even if I can just catch a Grimer I can walk and make it a muck and that would excite me.
2338000	2344000	So the cool thing is, thanks to San Francisco Trip, thanks to getting all these new Pokemon in the past few days.
2344000	2347000	My Pokedex is now at 151 seen.
2347000	2355000	Which is, I think, somebody in chat correct me if I'm wrong, but that is the max number you can have in seen without the regional ones.
2355000	2360000	Without Mr. Mime, without Farfetch'd, cause it's 154 I think is the big number.
2360000	2361000	But I'm up to 151 seen.
2361000	2364000	I don't have 151 caught, I have 142 caught.
2364000	2368000	So I still have, like I need Kabutops, I need Charizard.
2368000	2371000	There's just a bunch that I have to just get more candy to evolve.
2371000	2373000	Let's go to San Francisco next week.
2373000	2374000	Again?
2374000	2375000	Sure, why not.
2375000	2376000	There won't be double candy though.
2376000	2377000	I don't care.
2377000	2378000	But it'll still be fun.
2378000	2379000	It'll still be fun.
2379000	2380000	We'll go do like artsy shit.
2380000	2382000	There's an Eevee by the way in your backyard.
2382000	2383000	Is there?
2383000	2384000	Yeah.
2384000	2385000	I don't know if it has a lot of CP.
2385000	2386000	I need some more Vaporeons.
2386000	2387000	Why not?
2387000	2388000	Yeah, it's pretty intense actually.
2388000	2391000	SSG100Matt in chat says, I have about 778 Pidgey candies.
2391000	2393000	I don't want to talk about it.
2393000	2395000	Matt, evolve, evolve, evolve.
2395000	2399000	Evolve every single Pidgey you catch because that's 1000, no 500, whatever.
2399000	2401000	Every 4 Pidgeys evolves.
2401000	2404000	And right now, every 2 Pidgeys evolves.
2404000	2407000	So it's like when I see a Pidgey, I get excited because I'm like,
2407000	2408000	Eevee in your backyard's a bitch.
2408000	2409000	Free XP.
2409000	2413000	Maybe I should just play that instead of Ingress.
2413000	2414000	Honestly?
2414000	2420000	Well, especially in downtown because I'm guessing that there's a lot of like stuff down there.
2420000	2423000	I'm between a rock and a hard place with Ingress because I still love the people.
2423000	2424000	I love the community.
2424000	2426000	I love the events when like people come together and stuff like that.
2426000	2429000	And the farms and all that stuff when I get to see people.
2429000	2432000	But the game is just, I'm like so over it at this point.
2432000	2435000	And the whole thing that they're not doing an anomaly right now.
2435000	2436000	They're not doing a live event.
2436000	2442000	They're doing this thing where they have a global event where there's shards around the globe that need to be moved from place to place.
2442000	2445000	I'm just like, snore over it.
2445000	2446000	Like, I don't...
2446000	2450000	It's also like, especially with where we're at, you know, it's just overrun.
2450000	2455000	You know, like there's, I've got, you know, literally I played at the park yesterday when I took my kids there.
2455000	2458000	And within like 10 minutes, they're already taking it down.
2458000	2461000	I'm like, I'm not even doing anything.
2461000	2463000	I know, it's just, it's ruining the fun of the game.
2463000	2465000	I'm just, I'm just kind of over it.
2465000	2466000	It made me too angry.
2466000	2467000	I gave it up.
2467000	2469000	No seriously, I was just getting so mad.
2469000	2471000	I was like, you know what, I don't care anymore.
2471000	2472000	Alright.
2472000	2473000	By the way, there's also a cubone.
2473000	2475000	Fine.
2475000	2477000	Anyhow, let's see.
2477000	2482000	So, looking in comments over in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
2483000	2486000	ActDef says, I caught a Porygon with the Go+.
2486000	2487000	Yeah, here's the thing.
2487000	2490000	That Grimer, I caught with the Pogo+.
2490000	2495000	And I did that thing where I was like, I just felt the vibration on the Pogo+.
2495000	2499000	And I hit the button and then I realized, oh fuck, that was a yellow vibrate.
2499000	2501000	That was a Pokemon I don't have yet.
2501000	2505000	And my friends that were with me heard me go, fuck, like really loudly.
2505000	2507000	Which in San Francisco is kind of no big deal.
2507000	2509000	But they were like, what happened?
2509000	2515000	I'm like, whatever that Pokemon is right now, I just threw a Pokeball at it from my Pogo+.
2515000	2517000	And it's probably going to run away.
2517000	2520000	And they were like, somebody next to me was like, oh, it's a Grimer.
2520000	2521000	And I was like, fuck.
2521000	2524000	And then the thing vibrated to tell me I caught it.
2524000	2526000	And I was like, holy shit.
2526000	2528000	Because thank God, this is the one case where I'm happy.
2528000	2532000	It was only like an 86 CP Grinder or Grinder.
2532000	2533000	That's a different phonem.
2533000	2536000	86 CP Grimer is what I caught.
2536000	2538000	And so I was able to catch it with the Pogo+.
2538000	2541000	And it was like one of those like huge sigh of reliefs.
2541000	2543000	Like, wow, that was close.
2543000	2545000	So, anyway.
2545000	2550000	Oh, SSG100Matt in chat says, Rob, I know that.
2550000	2555000	The problem is that the last time I did a mass Pidgey evolve, they had a double XP weekend.
2555000	2559000	I am now paranoid to do another mass evolve again.
2559000	2560000	Okay.
2560000	2561000	All right, I see.
2561000	2562000	I see, I understand those concerns.
2562000	2563000	All right.
2563000	2564000	All right, anyway.
2564000	2566000	So that was pretty much it for my gaming week.
2566000	2567000	There you go.
2567000	2568000	Lots of Pokemon Go.
2568000	2571000	Let's see, other announcements.
2571000	2572000	I don't really have anything right now.
2572000	2573000	No shows off planned.
2573000	2577000	There's no expos coming up until April, the IGDA event.
2577000	2578000	But that isn't even on a Sunday.
2578000	2580000	That's on a Saturday.
2580000	2582000	We'll be broadcasting live from that again in some capacity.
2582000	2584000	I just don't have all the details just yet.
2584000	2586000	But that's only a couple months away.
2586000	2588000	So in the coming weeks, we'll have more on that.
2588000	2591000	I'm sure we'll have at least Gabe, if not Gabe and Bree, and maybe some other people.
2591000	2595000	Maybe I won't try to get them to bring some developers with them next time.
2595000	2596000	And talk about SAC Indie Arcade.
2596000	2597000	It'll be fun.
2597000	2599000	Yeah, I talked to Gabe yesterday.
2599000	2600000	Or not yesterday, Friday.
2600000	2601000	He probably hangs out at Hacker Lab.
2601000	2602000	Probably ran into him there.
2602000	2604000	Nope, I asked to interview him.
2604000	2605000	Oh, okay.
2605000	2606000	Cool.
2606000	2607000	So we got to talk to him.
2607000	2610000	He bothered me about not having the game done yet.
2610000	2615000	And I told him that I was just having trouble being motivated.
2615000	2617000	And my God, he brings enough motivation with himself.
2617000	2620000	It's like he can't help but feel inspired after talking to him.
2621000	2626000	Acteft in chat says, Sky, I had to walk almost 150 kilometers to evolve my only Grimer to a muck.
2626000	2628000	Well, here's the good news, Acteft.
2628000	2631000	I got six candies for capturing it, thanks to double candy.
2631000	2640000	And because it's only half distance you have to walk right now, I've already walked what, I guess, about six kilometers since I caught it because I'm already up to ten candies.
2640000	2644000	So I'm going to try to get some more walking in probably tomorrow.
2644000	2646000	I think the event's over, what, tomorrow or the next day?
2646000	2648000	No, it's through Valentine's Day.
2648000	2649000	But it's over on the 15th.
2649000	2654000	It's over right after, so I got to make sure I finish that.
2654000	2658000	I'll try to walk as much as possible to kind of get the jump on some of that candy.
2658000	2661000	So maybe I'll only have to walk 100 kilometers, Acteft.
2661000	2664000	That's what I'm trying for, anyway.
2664000	2669000	All right, let's get into some other long form news.
2669000	2671000	Lots of other big stuff happening this week.
2671000	2672000	This is a huge one, right, Loki?
2672000	2678000	Yeah, so they announced that Netflix is going to be getting a Castlevania series.
2678000	2683000	Right now it's just simply titled Castlevania Season 1 Part 1.
2683000	2694000	And there isn't a whole lot of details other than the producer Adi Shankar said that it's very much Castlevania done in the vein of Game of Thrones.
2694000	2698000	And they said it's an adaptation of Castlevania 3 Dracula's Curse.
2699000	2705000	And yeah, he says a second season of the show will come in 2018.
2705000	2709000	I think it's probably pretty easy. That'll be a slam dunk.
2709000	2712000	I mean, if they do it just decently, I mean...
2712000	2717000	Okay, but if it's this year, then it's got to be animated, right? It's not going to be live action, is it?
2717000	2719000	I think it could be live action.
2719000	2721000	We don't know if it's live action or animated, do we?
2721000	2723000	No, we don't know.
2723000	2725000	I'm thinking probably live action.
2725000	2729000	I would think computer-assisted animated would be something that could get done this year.
2729000	2734000	I mean, something like Castlevania, they just announced in February and they're going to have out this year.
2734000	2736000	Maybe they've been working on it, though.
2736000	2738000	That seems aggressive.
2738000	2740000	They're just starting on it, I don't know.
2740000	2741000	Interesting.
2741000	2746000	OrangeRideInChat over at live.vognetwork.com says it was rumored to be animated a long time ago, if I recall correctly.
2746000	2751000	And that's probably what I'm thinking of in my mind is that, wait a minute, I think back when this was supposed to be an animated thing.
2751000	2758000	So we shouldn't assume it's going to be for sure live action. It could be something animated, right?
2758000	2762000	Yeah, I mean, we shouldn't assume anything. We don't know yet.
2762000	2774000	But I don't know. You may remember that they did some... Remember, he did that Power Rangers short as well.
2776000	2778000	That kind of dark one.
2778000	2780000	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
2781000	2783000	I don't know. I'm cut down.
2783000	2791000	Yeah. I'm curious to see how this turns out. No, I think this could... Netflix produces a lot of quality stuff, obviously.
2791000	2795000	Things like Orange is the New Black, Stranger Things. These are great shows.
2795000	2800000	Now, granted, Netflix doesn't create the shows. Netflix distributes the shows.
2800000	2803000	But they're only going to distribute things that they have pretty good faith in.
2804000	2809000	I didn't think would be any good in some things that I thought were good. I used to watch them in R&D more.
2809000	2813000	Like, I watched He-Man. I tried to show my son what He-Man looked like. I'm like, my God, this show is terrible.
2813000	2815000	Like, I don't know. I like this thing.
2815000	2816000	And not everything on...
2816000	2818000	Buy all our playsets and toys?
2818000	2824000	It's pretty much. Like, in this first episode, I'm like, the animation doesn't match. Like, these people are rendered, like, very realistically.
2824000	2828000	And this wizard guy is, like, fucking cartoony. It makes no goddamn sense.
2828000	2829000	And then...
2829000	2831000	Not everything on Netflix is a slam dunk.
2831000	2836000	The kids have been, like, watching Home, which is this, like, DreamWorks movie that's really annoying.
2836000	2840000	But they watched that, and so I saw that there was a series on there, and I watched the series.
2840000	2844000	And the series is, like, almost like Adventure Time. Like, the series is fucking hilarious.
2844000	2851000	And I'm like, I was not expecting that of a spin-off animated show from a movie that was a DreamWorks movie.
2851000	2855000	And I'm like, shit, this is fucking good, actually. Which is kind of funny.
2856000	2861000	So, yeah, I mean, Netflix has a good track record, although they're not all slam dunks.
2861000	2866000	But I feel like, okay, this is good. This could be a very good, like, video game movie.
2866000	2873000	And I'm using that term loosely, because, yes, I know it's a TV show, but the way they're pitching it, what, this part one, season one thing?
2873000	2877000	It sounds more like a mini-series, which is, like, a long movie, right?
2877000	2880000	Which is fine, because that kind of gives it the space.
2880000	2887000	You know, I think a lot of the complexities with trying to make a video game movie is that a lot of video games take many, many, many hours to beat.
2887000	2892000	And a movie is an hour and a half, two and a half hours tops, unless you're James Cameron.
2892000	2901000	So, I, you know, I think having the space to work with time-wise will be beneficial for a story like Castlevania.
2901000	2906000	And I'm also glad to hear they're going with one of the, you know, they're going with at least a story that fans are going to know.
2906000	2915000	And is one of the more popular games in the franchise, yet still, because it's an 8-bit NES game, before there was voice acting and dialogue and all this stuff,
2915000	2919000	it's going to give them a lot of wiggle room to really have a lot of freedom with it.
2919000	2927000	Well, also just even the genre, you know, it's supernatural, it's kind of that medieval, you know, thing, people like vampires and that kind of shit.
2927000	2934000	So that'll just be pretty, you know, self-explanatory, so I think they'll do well.
2935000	2940000	And then for season two, they can base it off Symphony of the Night, so the first part is normal,
2940000	2943000	and then the second part, they can pull a fucking Stranger Things and do it upside down.
2946000	2953000	Yeah, I'm, yeah, that's true, they could just do exactly how the games did it, why not? I like that, that's good.
2953000	2960000	Darzagra, what do you think, hearing about all this, a Castlevania show on Netflix, you guys are a fan of your Castlevania series?
2960000	2969000	Yeah, and I don't want to think about it, does that make sense? Because I don't want to have an expectation.
2969000	2971000	Sure, you don't want to run the hype machine too much.
2971000	2982000	Exactly, because I certainly want to check it out, you know, but at the same time, I know how badly, badly it can go.
2982000	2985000	Yes, we did see Captain in the series as well.
2986000	2993000	Captain in was terrible. At the same time, I just really don't want to get my hopes up.
2993000	2994000	Sure.
2994000	2996000	I don't want to get my hopes up, and I don't want to talk myself out of it.
2996000	2997000	At least a trailer.
2997000	2999000	I'll wait for a trailer.
2999000	3000000	Wait for a trailer, okay.
3000000	3004000	But I will reserve my judgment until the event actually occurs.
3004000	3005000	Okay.
3005000	3009000	I don't want to have, I can't take another heartbreak.
3010000	3016000	For what it's worth, and I'm sure there's some people going, it's Konami though, Konami kind of ruins everything they touch these days.
3016000	3017000	And it's not Konami.
3017000	3018000	It's not Konami.
3018000	3022000	It's basically some dude that wants to license that property.
3022000	3025000	Konami's going to get a residual check and they'll be very happy.
3025000	3027000	We will add this to our Pachi slot profits.
3027000	3034000	If anything, if you want Castlevania to come back for better or worse, I don't know how that's going to work,
3034000	3038000	considering Igarashi is doing his own thing now with Bloodstained, but for better or for worse,
3038000	3043000	if you want to see Castlevania maybe come back as a game or something, you should hope that this does very well.
3043000	3046000	Because that's going to light a fire, even if not under Konami.
3046000	3051000	Under Konami to sell the rights for somebody else to make the game that's capable of doing it.
3051000	3052000	Pretty much.
3052000	3057000	I don't want, okay, I do not want a click and point game for Castlevania.
3057000	3059000	I do not want an adventure game.
3059000	3061000	I want a fucking platformer.
3062000	3070000	Heck, I think the guy who did Axiom Verge, considering that's all like one guy who did all that, ought to be trusted to do a new Metroid game.
3070000	3074000	Although, I could also understand he is one person who is allowed to do whatever the fuck he wants.
3074000	3076000	He's made a stellar game on his own.
3076000	3079000	Maybe he doesn't want to do someone else's game, and I would respect that completely.
3079000	3084000	But my point is, that guy made an amazing Metroid-inspired game.
3084000	3091000	There is talent out there, even if it's in the indie scene right now, that could create a stellar Castlevania game.
3091000	3100000	Which will be interesting because at the same time we have Igarashi doing Bloodstained, which we expect and hope will be a stellar Castlevania game.
3100000	3109000	I'm still, my idea of the pinnacle of Castlevania, I want to say Symphony of the Night because it was really pretty, a lot of fun.
3109000	3118000	But the last true Castlevania-style game for the same type of platformer was Dracula X.
3118000	3127000	And I call that the absolute pinnacle of the series. I would love to have that era of Castlevania touched on.
3127000	3131000	But Castlevania III, not everyone got to deal with Raptor.
3132000	3141000	Looking in chat over at Live.VogueNetwork.com, ActDeaf says, if Castlevania actually succeeds, will this mean we'll get new video game TV series?
3141000	3151000	Define success. If Castlevania becomes the next Stranger Things, which I think again is what Jamie is warning you exactly not to do.
3151000	3157000	Don't put that type of hype machine behind it. But of course, if it does well, there's going to be knock-offs that come out.
3157000	3165000	Stranger Things was awesome because it came out and people just watched it and they're like, man, this is fucking good. It wasn't like we knew what it was before it came out.
3165000	3170000	Maybe with the whole supernatural thing, you have Stranger Things to thank for this in some way, maybe.
3170000	3175000	But certainly, if something does well, there's going to be knock-offs that come out, for better or for worse.
3175000	3181000	And maybe it would encourage Konami to try something with Metal Gear or try something with one of their other IPs. We'll see.
3181000	3187000	I know. I know, guys. What would Metal Gear be without Kojima, though? But we'll see.
3187000	3195000	I would definitely go for a Skinemax version of Rumble Roses. It's a long shot.
3195000	3203000	Let's see. There's some comments on Captain N in chat. RageNator says, Captain N was terrible, but we watched it anyway. Why?
3203000	3207000	Because there was little to no other gaming programming on TV back then.
3207000	3215000	Let's see. Bob Coffee in chat talking about Castlevania says, shit, get ArcSys to give it the hardcore uprising treatment.
3215000	3225000	There you go. There's a lot of those, like, retro studios. What's the other one? They do Shantae and DuckTales. WayForward, right?
3225000	3232000	They've done a great job with some of those retro-type. I mean, Shantae was their own thing, but it was still in vain of a retro platformer, basically.
3233000	3242000	Anyway, there's tons of capable folks out there that could at least, you know, again, don't clone Symphony of the Night. You're never gonna hit that level again.
3242000	3251000	But do a new thing with Castlevania. Take it a new direction. Even the people that did the studios that did the 3DS games, or the DS games, those were even good.
3251000	3257000	When Igarashi was still around then, too, overseeing it. But anyway, we'll see. We'll see.
3257000	3263000	You can't tell me there's not someone that can imitate that style. I mean, come on. Everybody's not completely inept about that.
3263000	3279000	We'll see. We'll see. The other thing I just want to say with the whole Konami tie-in real quick is that, you know, for better or for worse, I kind of still think, not everybody agrees with me, but I kind of think the Silent Hill movie was probably the best video game translation they've done.
3279000	3282000	It was amazing. It was perfect.
3282000	3286000	Not everybody agrees. And I'm not talking about the sequel. I'm not talking about the sequel.
3286000	3287000	I liked it, though.
3287000	3288000	I'm talking about the original.
3288000	3291000	I've been seeing the sequel, but the original was good. I liked it.
3291000	3295000	I liked the second one because it was based off Silent Hill 3, which is my favorite Silent Hill.
3295000	3297000	Interesting, because a lot of people did not like that movie.
3297000	3299000	Well, a lot of people are wrong.
3299000	3303000	I saw a little bit of it on TV, but I didn't really stick with it.
3303000	3305000	I have it. You can come watch it.
3305000	3308000	I'd rather watch Showgirls again.
3308000	3310000	Well, we could do both. Kettlecorn.
3310000	3313000	Because, you know, in Showgirls, she persisted.
3313000	3318000	All right. Let's see.
3318000	3321000	Why can't we have Telltale take on Showgirls, then?
3321000	3323000	Like a Showgirls game.
3323000	3326000	Why not? God damn it. Why not? Let's see.
3326000	3331000	And ActDeaf says, I do agree with you, Sky. Thank you very much. I appreciate that.
3331000	3337000	Let's see. S2100Matt says, the Earthworm Jim show was pretty good at the time, if I recall.
3337000	3339000	Oh, yeah. I forgot they have that.
3339000	3341000	That's true. That's true.
3341000	3347000	There you go. Some comments from our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.
3347000	3352000	Let's move on to some other stuff going on in gaming news this week, which has to do with Twitch.
3352000	3355000	You know, Twitch, obviously the very popular live streaming platform.
3355000	3359000	Twitch now has communities in beta release.
3359000	3362000	This is something that they've just added is now a community page.
3362000	3366000	And basically what this boils down to is that, you know, when you stream a game on Twitch,
3366000	3370000	you usually say what game you're going to stream on Twitch,
3370000	3375000	and then you show up in the listings by game, and people can search by game,
3375000	3379000	and people can see what games are popular on Twitch right now and all this other stuff.
3379000	3383000	Well, now what's happening is that you can create communities,
3383000	3388000	and when you live stream, you can choose one game and one community,
3388000	3391000	if I'm understanding all these blog posts and things correct,
3391000	3392000	because this is a brand new thing.
3392000	3396000	You can stream to one game and one community,
3396000	3399000	and now when you browse for things on Twitch,
3399000	3404000	you not only can browse by game, but you can browse by community.
3404000	3412000	Well, what's interesting is that a lot of the communities that were first popping up were communities for games.
3412000	3417000	So a lot of the biggest communities you see right now is Heroes of the Storm, Overwatch,
3417000	3419000	and it's just all the same stuff as the games.
3419000	3421000	But you start to dig a little deeper.
3421000	3426000	Okay, a little deeper would be, well, now you see Overwatch pro gamers.
3426000	3430000	There's a category for speed running, which obviously is a huge fucking deal
3430000	3433000	thanks to Awesome Games Done Quick and all the efforts around there.
3433000	3439000	Dig a little deeper, and then you start to find stuff like LGBT streamers,
3439000	3446000	people that have this common interest, people in a particular geolocation.
3447000	3449000	I saw a UK channel earlier today.
3449000	3456000	So now there's discoverability not just by game, but by community.
3456000	3460000	But it's interesting that you're really limited as a streamer to just pick one community
3460000	3462000	to kind of promote your stream under.
3462000	3464000	You can switch it, of course, as you switch your stream,
3464000	3467000	but I just think that's a really neat thing for discoverability,
3467000	3470000	and discoverability is really where Twitch is kind of killing it right now.
3470000	3474000	So I think this is a really interesting expansion for them.
3474000	3475000	What do you guys think hearing about this?
3475000	3477000	I think it's good to build on that stuff.
3477000	3478000	Yeah.
3478000	3481000	I mean, because what they had before was kind of basic,
3481000	3486000	so it's nice to be able to have a little bit more other than just the type of game
3486000	3490000	or the title of the game to go off of.
3490000	3494000	And the creative directory and all this other stuff not going away.
3494000	3497000	This doesn't impact creative, IRL, or any of that other stuff.
3497000	3500000	So this is just another kind of directory.
3500000	3504000	So it doesn't? Because that'd be kind of cool if they had stuff tied in with that as well.
3504000	3508000	Like, you know, cooking or Bob Ross.
3508000	3512000	Why not? You can have a community of Bob Ross fans.
3512000	3514000	Or like, yeah, I don't know.
3514000	3519000	We could have a VoG community even, although, see, here's the thing with that.
3519000	3524000	I actually don't know if that is the particular best use of something like this,
3524000	3528000	because technically we do have a VoG network Twitch.
3528000	3530000	We can just set up that VoG network.
3530000	3532000	I think we have one, don't we, Bobby?
3532000	3537000	I think we signed up for one and we just have it for those projects we'll get around to someday.
3537000	3544000	I think we have one, and we could technically set up that feed to just auto-host VoG personalities when they stream.
3544000	3549000	So I kind of feel like we don't necessarily need a community.
3549000	3553000	But this is a way to kind of go even maybe a little bigger than that, if that makes sense.
3553000	3558000	So, let's see, Bobby Blackwolf in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,
3558000	3563000	you got a VoG Twitch. Oh, I did? I guess I did. I signed up for it and I don't even remember.
3563000	3568000	I hope I remember the password. Bobby Blackwolf says, we were going to use it if we marathoned.
3568000	3570000	That's right. I know we were talking about doing that type of stuff.
3570000	3572000	And we probably will get around to it someday.
3572000	3576000	But, yeah, so I would think we could just, if we wanted to do something,
3576000	3579000	that we just set that channel up to auto-host, which I had to do.
3579000	3582000	If I did set it up, I had to just reset the password.
3582000	3588000	And I'm just going to go in there and set it up to auto-host all the people that I know have Twitch
3588000	3591000	that are affiliated with VoG network.
3591000	3593000	Because it's not just us and Bobby.
3593000	3598000	I know once in a great while I've seen Captain Spike from Game Buoys streaming.
3598000	3601000	Shane from Ranger Pride certainly streaming.
3601000	3603000	He's been doing a lot of Resident Evil 7 lately.
3603000	3605000	So there are other people on the network that do it.
3605000	3607000	So we could set something like that up, I'm sure.
3607000	3609000	Pod Culture has one. Thank you.
3609000	3614000	So that's what we could do for our immediate community.
3614000	3619000	But I'm excited to, and then see what would happen is that I would say that the VoG network channel
3619000	3629000	should join a podcasting community or podcasters community or radio community
3629000	3632000	or something that speaks more like what VoG network is a part of, join that community.
3632000	3634000	If that makes sense. Anyway.
3634000	3636000	I'm excited to see how this plays out.
3636000	3640000	A quick update though. I want to mention in the live streaming space,
3640000	3645000	there's YouTube Gaming has obviously been trying to come for a piece of Twitch.
3645000	3648000	But then we have Beam as kind of more of an up and comer.
3648000	3652000	But a lot of folks paying attention to them as opposed to Hitbox and some of the others
3652000	3654000	because Beam was purchased by Microsoft.
3654000	3661000	Well, the Beam streaming just hit Microsoft's alpha program for the people that are in the alpha.
3661000	3665000	You know how they have those different stages of dashboards on the Xbox One?
3665000	3672000	So people in the most inner circle of Microsoft hell in their preview program can now stream to Beam.
3672000	3676000	It looks pretty bare bones from what I was looking at, but I'm not in the alpha program,
3676000	3677000	so I can't play with it firsthand.
3677000	3682000	But that is, you know, once Beam is native in Xbox One, that's going to be interesting to see
3682000	3685000	how that's going to grow that network.
3685000	3688000	Because, you know, Beam has all the interactive stuff going on with it too.
3688000	3692000	There's a lot of stuff I do like about Beam and even I'm having a hard time going,
3692000	3695000	Oh, do I want to stream on Twitch where all the people are at?
3695000	3698000	Or do I want to stream in Beam because I like this message of the interactivity
3698000	3701000	and maybe Beam is going to be like the next big wave and you want to be a part of that?
3701000	3704000	Or do I just go to YouTube?
3704000	3707000	Probably not because there's a lot YouTube does that I'm not a fan of.
3707000	3708000	So...
3709000	3710000	Anyway.
3711000	3712000	All right.
3712000	3714000	And they don't have a way to do it to both.
3714000	3719000	That'd be cool, like a website that would just spit it out to all the different sites.
3719000	3723000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, is Xtopher still streaming Rayman?
3723000	3724000	He does stream games.
3724000	3728000	I don't think he does Rayman anymore, but I have seen him do random stuff on Xbox One.
3728000	3729000	So there's that.
3729000	3730000	Let's see.
3730000	3735000	Tigerclaw says, Twitch does have a podcast directory so you could do a live podcast on Twitch.
3735000	3738000	Believe me, I've given that a lot of thought.
3738000	3739000	A lot.
3739000	3742000	It's just going to cost money in upgrades here in the studio.
3742000	3744000	But it's on my mind for sure.
3744000	3745000	Anyway.
3746000	3749000	And Tigerclaw says, you should follow Twitch slash vog network.
3749000	3752000	Twitch TV slash vog network just in case they do something.
3752000	3753000	Yes.
3753000	3754000	Yes.
3754000	3755000	Just in case.
3755000	3756000	That would be a good thing to go follow.
3756000	3758000	And then I'm not above giving my own personal channel a cheap plug.
3758000	3759000	Rob Roberts.
3759000	3760000	Over on Twitch.
3760000	3761000	I don't remember what my channel is.
3761000	3762000	I think you're Loki O-L-R.
3762000	3765000	You're either Loki O-L-R or O-L-R Loki.
3767000	3769000	I could just go look at my auto host because you're on it.
3769000	3770000	So she...
3770000	3771000	I think mine's O-L-R Dark Sakura.
3771000	3772000	Yeah, okay.
3772000	3773000	Or with an underscore.
3773000	3774000	Yeah, that's maybe why I'm confused.
3774000	3775000	I remember mine.
3775000	3778000	I had trouble moving it from Justin TV.
3778000	3780000	It was like being stupid.
3780000	3781000	Yeah, yeah.
3781000	3782000	Not wanting to come up.
3782000	3783000	Boy.
3783000	3786000	Some of us got bit being an early adopter on Justin TV, huh?
3786000	3789000	With that whole like, you can't bring your names over or whatever.
3789000	3790000	But anyway.
3790000	3792000	That's all in the past now.
3792000	3793000	Let's move on.
3793000	3794000	More news to talk about.
3794000	3795000	More big news, right Dark Sakura?
3795000	3797000	This is another big deal from this week.
3797000	3799000	Yeah, green light's going away.
3799000	3800000	Steam green light.
3800000	3801000	Yep.
3801000	3802000	Wow.
3802000	3803000	Bye.
3803000	3805000	Poor little green light.
3805000	3807000	This little light of mine will not shine.
3807000	3808000	So yeah.
3808000	3812000	Basically, to just recap what steam green light was.
3812000	3817000	Is that it would allow customers to vote on different projects.
3817000	3826000	And they are doing away with it in favor of a different more streamlined system that is called Steam Direct.
3826000	3830000	So green light, the point of it was just to gauge interest.
3830000	3834000	But now this newer system is going to be...
3834000	3839000	It's not necessarily as much of a popularity contest like green light was.
3839000	3845000	As well, developers will be able to fill out a form and submit their game to a compatibility test.
3845000	3847000	Pay a fee and launch the game.
3847000	3853000	So right now, for green light, they pay $100.
3853000	3856000	And they'll have to pay more, quite likely.
3857000	3861000	The thought is that it can go anywhere up to $5,000.
3861000	3864000	But they're looking to find a balance.
3864000	3871000	So they want to discourage questionable quality games.
3871000	3874000	Just anyone putting whatever they want to.
3874000	3882000	And actually making sure that the games that are promoted are well executed, well thought out, good games.
3883000	3888000	This is a tricky thing because I tend to agree with what's in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
3888000	3893000	JD says internet voting is always super right for manipulation, so that's probably a good thing.
3893000	3896000	And I think there is a lot of garbage and noise on Steam green light.
3896000	3903000	But then I think of people like YYR who got his multitasking thing through on green light.
3903000	3908000	And I'm like, I just, as a fan of his games, I'm excited for him and what that's going to bring and all that.
3908000	3913000	So it's like, it really sucks that a few bad apples kind of fucked it for everybody else, you know what I mean?
3913000	3919000	Well, it's not just that too, but they're also getting a generally lower population of voters now.
3919000	3922000	Because there's so much out there.
3922000	3923000	Not just that.
3923000	3924000	There's not a lot of incentive to vote.
3924000	3928000	I mean, in numbers, people are losing interest in that type of a thing.
3928000	3936000	But they said this doesn't affect anybody who's using Steam early access where developers can sell incomplete builds of the game.
3936000	3943000	But just in general, that it hasn't remained a viable system, so they are looking to transition into something a little bit better.
3943000	3950000	I still think this is a fucking terrible plan, to be honest, because it's not addressing the problem that they've had from day one with green light.
3950000	3958000	I don't think the voter manipulation thing is such a big deal because, you know, still some games don't get through that process.
3958000	3962000	And I feel that some of those that don't get through are just shit.
3962000	3969000	There are a lot that do get through their shit, or some that do get through that look good, but then they're shit and then they don't run.
3969000	3972000	Because there's not a fucking QA process with the whole thing.
3972000	3976000	You're paying a fee to put your game on the service, and then you don't do any checking.
3976000	3983000	And now, all they're doing instead, you're not even going to have the people voting on whether they want the game in or not.
3983000	3985000	It's just, you pay your fee and it's released.
3985000	3989000	That's even worse! That's worse than having people vote on your game.
3989000	3994000	And now, on top of all that, I mean, I guess, general compatibility, what the fuck does that mean?
3994000	3999000	And now, if I want to release something, I could possibly pay up to $5,000 to do that.
3999000	4003000	I'm not releasing on Steam, if that's the case, because I don't have $5,000.
4003000	4011000	And thank you for blocking me from being able to release on Steam, because dipshit's fucking released garbage and you never had a QA team look at that shit.
4011000	4015000	And you still don't fucking have a QA team look at that shit. It's gonna get worse.
4015000	4019000	All you're doing is blocking people that don't have money to release on your platform.
4019000	4023000	That doesn't mean that they're bad developers. It just means they don't have money.
4023000	4027000	They're trying to make money by putting shit on Steam, and you're fucking blocking that shit.
4027000	4030000	Thank you, Val, for being fucking stupid as usual.
4030000	4035000	So, you have quite the tone. You have a very pointed tone about this.
4035000	4037000	It's fucking ridiculous! Everybody said they need a QA process.
4037000	4042000	They need a team of people to look at this shit to make sure that it functions.
4042000	4046000	That it actually is a game that's playable, that's not garbage.
4046000	4052000	But they're not doing that. Why am I paying like $1,000, $5,000 to the service?
4052000	4056000	What are you giving me for that? It's per game.
4056000	4060000	Greenlight used to be you pay $100 and then you release as many games as you want.
4060000	4070000	And I think that's the problem, because $100 for a bunch of games, that's good for if someone doesn't have a lot of money, but then there's a lot of garbage on there.
4070000	4076000	So how about this? How about you strike a compromise? Keep the Greenlight system, raise the fee for $100 per game instead.
4076000	4078000	Then you're not going to get all this garbage on there.
4078000	4082000	Bobby Black Wolf wants to point out, you do realize you get the money back if it sells, right?
4082000	4089000	So that $5,000 comes back to you in the sales before Valve takes their cut, basically.
4089000	4095000	But even with that being said, I mean, $5,000 is a lot of money. That's still a very high bar.
4095000	4103000	If it was $500, maybe, I mean, that's, you know, it's still nothing to sneeze at, but it's still relatively reasonable.
4103000	4110000	Even if you couldn't come up with the $500 yourself, you could probably crowdfund it with minimal ease if your game is worthy.
4110000	4112000	But it's still ridiculous so that someone would have to go through it.
4112000	4117000	And I bet you anything, the quality of games is not going to fucking differ on there, especially if you're getting...
4117000	4121000	And so what if you get that money back? Who cares if you get the money back?
4121000	4128000	Then what's the point if I'm paying that to you? How about you just charge less money and actually use it for something, like a QA team?
4128000	4135000	Ragenator in chat says, Loki OLR is right. There needs to be QA. Digital homicide is prime example of why QA is needed.
4135000	4140000	They're just part of it, I mean, but there's a lot of shit out there, not even digital homicide crap.
4140000	4146000	They're just crazy people. And that's just, they're just simply unplayable games.
4146000	4153000	Like, just shitty games that are on there that they just don't function at all.
4153000	4158000	And you just, there needs to be someone checking this, or at the very least, you know, have the community say,
4158000	4163000	Hey, notifying Steam, report this game because it's not fucking playable, and then they can look into it.
4163000	4168000	SSG100Matt says, How does Apple handle their app space for mobile stuff?
4168000	4175000	Well, yeah, I mean, Apple obviously does some sense of QA policing on their games, well, and apps,
4175000	4182000	because, you know, there's a process to get listed on the store, but at the same time, there's a lot of noise on that store.
4182000	4187000	You know what I mean? There's a lot of, like, garbage apps on, like, games and people trying to make a quick buck.
4187000	4188000	That's what ratings are for.
4188000	4195000	Like the whole, when Fire Emblem Heroes came out, a bunch of these games that are just garbage games
4195000	4203000	renamed themselves to Fire Emblem Heroes tic-tac-toe, Fire Emblem Heroes, just to kind of get found in the searches and things like that.
4203000	4207000	You know what I mean? Like, it's just, there's a lot of, like, poopy caca things out there.
4207000	4215000	But at least, at least, now to be fair, at least, I think what Apple, you can't really QA if a game is good.
4215000	4222000	That's too subjective. But at least what Apple is doing is making sure this isn't gonna cause your phone to explode.
4222000	4224000	Like, what happened to their mouse?
4224000	4227000	Well, Blackwall's saying he had a $5,000 amount. That was in the actual article.
4227000	4231000	They were saying they were considering pricing between $100 to $5,000.
4231000	4236000	Granted, $5,000 I think is gonna be a stretch, but even if it was $1,000, that's still fucking ridiculous.
4236000	4240000	I mean, considering that, then fine. You know what's gonna happen because of that?
4240000	4243000	If you fucking do that shit, we'll go to other platforms.
4243000	4249000	You know, release a Humble Bundle or Humble Store that, you know, it's not a Steam version of the game or something like that.
4249000	4253000	I don't know if it needs to be on Steam to be released on Humble, but there's other places, but...
4253000	4256000	Several people in chat yelling out itch.io.
4256000	4258000	Dungeonbuster pointing out itch.io.
4258000	4265000	Parodied Steam's move with their itch.io direct page that requires no applications or approval necessary.
4265000	4272000	And I have heard, you know, if you haven't poked around on itch.io, I haven't, and I admittedly have used it very, very limited.
4272000	4277000	So, I do need to go around and poke on there a little more because I hear there's a lot of good, like, even free...
4277000	4281000	Like, just like the shit that would have been in the demo scenes in the Commodore 64 days.
4281000	4285000	You have that type of stuff that exists on itch.io, so there's a lot to find there.
4285000	4291000	I'm just worried that, like, this kind of stuff is going to stop people from releasing their stuff.
4291000	4293000	How are you going to make money if, you know...
4293000	4299000	Like, even locally, we've got indie guys, you know, that are literally two-man teams going to release a game.
4299000	4303000	Where are they going to get the funding to put this out there?
4303000	4313000	And even still, like, with Steam Greenlight, that's also a way to generate hype for something because you have it being viewed by a lot of people seeing that this is coming out.
4313000	4317000	And they're able to kind of promote it and stuff like that.
4317000	4319000	Now that's not even going to be a thing anymore.
4319000	4328000	I just... This is not... Raising the bar of entry level is not going to solve the problem.
4328000	4337000	Because you have a quality issue, and if you're not checking the quality, then it's going to be the same problem still.
4337000	4341000	To be fair, let me ask this last question here.
4341000	4347000	Could it be that what they're trying to do is, since they just don't have the money...
4347000	4355000	Which I kind of don't believe, but at the same time, they say they don't have the money or the capacity to hire the people to do QA checks or what have you, to look for these kinds of quality things.
4355000	4363000	Could it be that the fact that the money you're paying up front, which you do recoup if you sell enough copies of the game, the fact that the game should be able to sell...
4364000	4371000	What, if you're selling a $10 game, what, 500 copies to get $5,000 back, if it's that high? We'll just make that up.
4371000	4377000	That is the quality check. Is your game worthy of selling 500 copies? That's the quality check.
4377000	4384000	I don't think that's it at all, because if you make it a really obscure game that's of good quality, but just doesn't sell.
4384000	4389000	I mean, I don't think that necessarily... That doesn't dictate the functionality of the game.
4389000	4394000	You could have a game that looks really good, but just is fucking broken.
4394000	4402000	And if people buy it, I mean, how's that going to work with refunds and stuff? I think the whole idea is stupid.
4402000	4411000	But hey, if they really don't want to go the route of QA, then they're just not going to have quality... They're going to have a quality issue on Steam, which is what they have already.
4411000	4418000	Yeah, and maybe even selling 500 copies of a game can probably be a bit of a challenge.
4418000	4427000	Because I want to say, you remember the guy that we had on our show a couple months ago, and he did the Cap President game? Remember that?
4427000	4432000	Well, we've been following each other on Twitter a little bit, and he was posting about some of this stuff.
4432000	4440000	And I want to say, he said that his latest game had only sold so many copies that he wouldn't have recouped a $5,000 cost.
4440000	4449000	Yeah, I mean, what if you make a small game that's like you're charging 99 cents on there? Doesn't mean it's a bad game, it's just a short game or an artsy game or something like that.
4449000	4460000	And then... you're fucked. Or what if you want to release a free-to-play game? Then what? I mean, it's just... it's not good.
4460000	4465000	I just don't think this is the way that they need to go about it. I think that a QA process would be good.
4465000	4479000	And granted, I'm not expecting them to be able to QA test to death this stuff, but if you're charging like $100 per game, and let's just say that that doesn't get recouped, that's just a part of doing business on Steam, which I'm fine with.
4479000	4487000	Have that $100 go to pay somebody to look at the game for a few hours. That, I think, will give you a good idea.
4488000	4500000	Alright. Well, I'm sure this will only develop in the coming weeks, as there are plenty in the community like Loki who have very strong opinions on this that Valve is going to have to listen to for better or for worse.
4500000	4507000	So we'll see what happens in the coming weeks. In the meantime, though, we do need to move on with some other news. Loki, you have the next story.
4507000	4514000	Yep. So let's talk a little bit about Valve some more, and what they actually are doing since they're not putting out a QA team.
4514000	4529000	They are going to be developing VR games. There are some more full VR games, and these are unlike the stuff that they released before, because remember they did like The Lab, which was, I think, that whole Portal 2 thing.
4530000	4555000	But yeah, so basically you're saying they have the ability to think about input and devices and design systems should be like, and when he's trying to design games, their sense is going to be to allow to build such more better entertainment experiences for people, because now they develop the VR hardware, so let's make some good VR games that go along with that.
4555000	4568000	I just want them to release something. That's really it. Just release a game. Portal 3 preferably, but anything with a 3 in it would be great. Anything would be good.
4568000	4576000	Even an on 3 would be fine. But you do know that they have been doing these little games for the HTC Vive.
4576000	4585000	Ironically, the number of games that are in development right now in Valve? 3. They have 3 games in development. 3. Half-Life 3 confirmed.
4588000	4589000	Alright.
4590000	4597000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Laundry Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase CLUB.
4597000	4611000	Moving on, let's talk about a different company. I don't want to talk about Valve now. Let's talk about Square Enix. Why not? Let's talk about Final Fantasy for a little bit. Or in this case, we'll talk about Dissida. I don't know if I ever say the same name. Dissidia. Is that what it is? Dissidia.
4611000	4620000	Final Fantasy Dissidia is the fighting game spin-off, of course, and so it's kind of big in the arcades, and I think...
4620000	4625000	Is it out in the arcades yet? Because I remember seeing the trailers for it, but I didn't know that was...
4625000	4631000	I thought they had two versions of it out, actually. There was an original one, and now there's a second version that's out.
4631000	4648000	But anyway, director Takeo Kujiroaka in Weekly Famitsu Magazine had mentioned that if we can export it to the world as a high proficiency competitive fighting tool, while also an enjoyable team battle Final Fantasy, it might even rise up as an esports event.
4648000	4657000	If that happens, the next would be a global tournament, right? I can't say too much, but I want to use these sorts of ambitions to make Dissidia Final Fantasy an even better game.
4657000	4674000	So, could Square Enix be looking at doing something kind of like what you see with Capcom Pro and all this stuff, Overwatch League and all this, but something that's a little more around this Final Fantasy Dissidia game?
4675000	4688000	I think Final Fantasy has the built-in fanbase for something like that. I think it would attract probably new people that may not always necessarily get into fighting games, just based on the strength of the Final Fantasy characters.
4688000	4700000	I think there's a lot of interest in this game. I think where it's not doing so well is that we are sitting here going, we're not sure where you can get this game right now, or how many versions of it actually exist.
4701000	4702000	Or if it's even out.
4702000	4709000	That should be pretty fucking clear if we want this to be an esports game and something that's going to be catching on a little bit.
4709000	4716000	So, don't make it something that you can only get in Japan only either or anything like that.
4718000	4727000	But anyway, let's move on to some other gaming news. Just a few more stories and then we'll get to this week's classic system of the month.
4727000	4741000	In New York, the Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman basically claimed that Time Warner Cable defrauded its customers by providing slower than advertised internet service.
4741000	4756000	And this actually came about because of thousands of League of Legends players, especially ones who were not just playing it but were also watching the streams.
4756000	4774000	There is an 87 page complaint that was released on the first of this month that said that it was also further complicated by the fact that Time Warner Cable merged with Charter and basically increased their profitability while lowering their overall speeds.
4775000	4785000	Also in this claim is that they also worked to confuse the FCC, the Federal Communications Commission.
4785000	4794000	So, this is all going to be going forward. The claims start from January 2012 up until now.
4794000	4804000	And that they also added that when it was Spectrum that they leased modems and wireless routers that were incapable of providing the advertised speed.
4804000	4812000	I can tell you what I know of our local provider that they also do that here. You get much better speed if you buy your own.
4812000	4826000	They were noting that when they connected wirelessly, subscribers on a 300 Mbps plan were only getting 15% of the promised speed and so on.
4826000	4832000	So, yeah. This, I mean, honestly enough, I think this could set a great precedent.
4833000	4841000	Yeah, I agree. Cable companies are doing shady, shady fucking things as cable is starting to become more irrelevant in the age of the internet.
4841000	4847000	And now your cable providers are basically your internet providers and they want to make their money wherever they can.
4847000	4852000	And this is where we get things like data caps and all this other stuff.
4852000	4863000	The only thing that led to an improvement in performance was, in this case, Netflix and Riot Games paying the provider to improve access to their customers.
4863000	4865000	Oh, hell no. Oh, hell no.
4865000	4867000	So, yeah. It's basically...
4867000	4870000	This is why net neutrality is important.
4870000	4876000	They said that it took the open internet order to solve those issues.
4877000	4885000	You know, so it's shady, shady shit. It is shady as hell. And while they can get away with it, they're going to do it.
4885000	4887000	This is why we regulate business.
4887000	4892000	Yeah. And I just, you know, again, I don't want to get too political.
4892000	4901000	But the rumor is the person that they're bringing in that's going to be overseeing the FCC question mark.
4901000	4905000	Sorry, I don't have the source right in front of me. Maybe somebody in chat will correct me.
4905000	4908000	But is kind of anti net neutrality.
4908000	4914000	And we'll see. Actions speak louder than words, so I'm not going to jump to judgment.
4914000	4920000	But if that is true that this individual is anti net neutrality, that sucks.
4920000	4924000	And this is why. Like, this is why I'm telling you this is bad.
4924000	4938000	Because now you're going to have, like, even this radio show could possibly be something that is not going to come through full speed on your internet or possibly even at all.
4938000	4946000	Because I'm telling you, if your cable company wants us to pay money to open up the port so you can do shoutcast or whatever, fuck them in their ears.
4946000	4950000	That's not happening. But this is why net neutrality is important.
4950000	4959000	Well, in conclusion, they want, I guess in this case, Spectrum, because that's how it went under, to produce an accounting and disgorge all money.
4959000	4964000	This is a quote. Moneys resulting from the fraudulent and illegal practices alleged.
4964000	4974000	They're also asking for a series of civil penalties ranging from two thousand dollars to five thousand for each violation of New York law.
4974000	4983000	So. And of course, Time Warner Cable is like, we're sad that they did this after our merger. Me.
4983000	4986000	We do good stuff. Me.
4986000	4989000	But but but is it true, though? Is it true, though?
4989000	4991000	Me. Allegedly.
4991000	4995000	All right. Moving on. Loki.
4995000	4998000	OK, so.
4998000	5007000	Let's talk a little bit about delays, and unfortunately, I kind of figured this may have been something that's going to be delayed since we haven't heard too much about it lately.
5007000	5018000	But yeah, during, I guess, the latest Ubisoft earnings call, the South Park Fractured But Whole has been delayed yet again.
5018000	5027000	And now it's going to come out in the next fiscal year, which relies anywhere between April 1st of this year to March 31st of next year.
5027000	5029000	So no idea when that's coming out.
5029000	5033000	Well, that sucks. That was when I was looking forward to.
5033000	5034000	Yeah, me as well.
5034000	5040000	But here we go again with the whole bad game is bad forever and if it needs more time in the oven to be good.
5040000	5045000	That's true. South Park was fantastic. You know, the Stick of Truth was a great game, so I'm willing to give them time.
5045000	5053000	So it's like it's one of those things where, like, I don't know how else to express this. I'm upset, but I'm not upset.
5053000	5060000	I'm not upset if they have to take the time to make it just right, but I'm upset in the moment that I was hoping to play it this month and I won't be.
5060000	5066000	But then again, if it was supposed to be coming out around February or March, then you got Mass Effect coming out.
5066000	5073000	Exactly. Mass Effect Andromeda, we have Zelda, so okay, you know, I'll deal. I'll deal.
5073000	5078000	And at least what? The pre-orders are still getting the Stick of Truth on PS4 and all that, right?
5078000	5083000	Yeah, in fact, ironically enough, they refunded my pre-order for that, but I still got Stick of Truth.
5083000	5084000	Really?
5084000	5093000	Yeah, they did something, I think, either when it got delayed or something happened where they refunded the amount that you paid for that, but I still keep the free game.
5093000	5103000	Come on, Noel Gus in chat says April 1st would be a perfect release date. Why not? Although, that seems like a little soon.
5103000	5109000	And now I feel like this is probably going to be summer. Like, if they've gone to this length to delay the game, they didn't delay it 45 days.
5109000	5115000	Yeah, they're not going to make it miss the fiscal year just because they want to do a joke release date.
5115000	5121000	This is now summer or even potentially fall. Summer seems likely.
5121000	5122000	Probably.
5122000	5126000	But I guess we don't know. So, alright.
5126000	5132000	And come on, Noel Gus in chat says I hope Mass Effect butt play makes up for it.
5133000	5137000	Me too. Do you see there's already fan communities around some of the alien characters?
5137000	5138000	Are they going to fracture that butt hole?
5138000	5139000	Yes!
5139000	5143000	Yes, you can always fracture butt holes in Mass Effect, that's true.
5143000	5150000	Well, I mean, I only run like one of the now biggest Mass Effect tumblers.
5150000	5155000	Oh, oh, well, oh, excuse, excuse, I am in the presence of royalty, excuse me.
5155000	5159000	I'm almost about to hit the 10,000 person threshold.
5159000	5160000	Congrats.
5160000	5161000	I'm Mass Effect-ing.
5161000	5162000	Congrats.
5162000	5170000	Well, anyway, the fandom is wanking. The wank is happening. There is just all kinds of wankage.
5173000	5174000	Wank!
5174000	5179000	Alright, let's move on. One more story for you guys and we'll get to our classic system of the week.
5179000	5184000	And this has to do with, hey, something a lot of you are looking forward to on the Switch, Splatoon 2.
5184000	5188000	And many folks, you know, are going to be excited to play this this summer.
5188000	5193000	But guess what? Maybe you'll get to play it a little sooner. How about March 24th?
5193000	5200000	Yeah, no, the game isn't releasing on March 24th, but they are going to be doing a global test fire for the game.
5200000	5202000	You may remember that they did this with the original Splatoon.
5202000	5211000	And you could play Splatoon, the multiplayer modes, online to kind of like stress test the servers, basically, for free for a very limited amount of time.
5212000	5218000	So the bad news is it's not like all weekend long or anything. It is still some very limited windows.
5218000	5225000	But on March 24th, you'll be able to play from noon to 12.59 Pacific and from 8 to 8.59 Pacific.
5225000	5232000	And then on March 25th, you can play from 4 to 5 a.m. Pacific, which obviously they're doing that for other time zones.
5232000	5237000	12 to 1 Pacific, 8 to 9, a minute before 9, come on.
5237000	5242000	8 to 9 Pacific is on the 25th, and then on March 26th, you can play from 4 to 5 a.m. Pacific.
5242000	5247000	So, yeah, they'll be doing this Splatoon test fire. It's still going to be limited in scope.
5247000	5254000	You're only going to get to use four weapons, and there's going to be like remixed versions of the Splat Roller and Splat Charger.
5254000	5260000	That will all be available on the eShop, so something else to look forward to on the Switch in March, if nothing else.
5260000	5267000	I mean, yes, it's very limited in scope, but at least you know you get to spend a good hour or two with Splatoon 2 in March before June.
5267000	5270000	I feel like you're going to say something real bitchy here, Logie.
5270000	5274000	You would be correct. It's limited in scope, kind of like the launch lineup for the Switch.
5282000	5287000	Anyway, let's get to the classic system of the week, of the month.
5287000	5289000	Thanks for the spoilers, Rob.
5289000	5294000	How am I supposed to promote this? You fucking changed everything this year.
5294000	5295000	That's right.
5295000	5296000	I don't know what to do anymore.
5296000	5299000	I'm a lady. I can change my mind.
5299000	5309000	Anyhow, every week Dark Soccer steps into the gaming vault and then finds a game that she thinks, hey, you ungrateful brats, you should be checking out this game.
5309000	5312000	Screw your buttholes in Mass Effect itself.
5312000	5314000	These are kind of the list of systems I wish I had.
5315000	5323000	But once a month, Dark Soccer likes to surprise us by saying, you know what, I'm going to give you a whole system to play with this month.
5323000	5328000	It's the classic system of the month, Dark Soccer. What did you pick for the month of February 2017?
5328000	5332000	I picked the PC-FX. Ever hear of it?
5332000	5333000	No.
5333000	5340000	The PC-FX was made by NEC, so it is in the family of the PC Engine.
5340000	5345000	I actually have heard of this. I just said no to let you chat.
5345000	5352000	It was released on January 23, 1994, right after the PlayStation and a month after the Sega Saturn.
5352000	5355000	And it is, of course, the successor to the PC Engine.
5355000	5360000	So for us, the PC Engine was the TurboGrafx-16.
5361000	5370000	It was only released in Japan. It looks like a PC tower, and it was meant to be upgradeable.
5370000	5377000	But the graphics system in it was pretty outdated by the time it came out and pretty underpowered.
5377000	5381000	So it actually was a commercial failure.
5381000	5388000	So they say it's still got its pretty big fan base like any system can have.
5388000	5394000	It also had a general lack of developer support, so it had fewer games.
5394000	5402000	And basically, it was NEC's last gaming console and was discontinued in February 1998.
5404000	5412000	Basically, it was meant to be, like I was saying, the competitor with Saturn and the PlayStation.
5412000	5418000	And they built it under this 32-bit architecture called Iron Man.
5422000	5428000	And they demonstrated Iron Man at a few trade shows in 1992.
5428000	5435000	And we're starting to discuss the release of an Iron Man-based video game system with their developers.
5435000	5439000	And the PC Engine was still super, super popular at the time.
5439000	5442000	So people were like, hey, we're pretty happy about this.
5442000	5451000	But there were plenty also, though, who were uninterested from switching to the more powerful hardware while the PC Engine was still alive and well.
5451000	5454000	PC Engine was still kicking ass.
5454000	5464000	So they put the project on hold and put more work into it so that they could release it when all the other ones were there.
5464000	5475000	So by the time they released the PC-FX, it still was relatively unchanged from what they had displayed in 1992.
5475000	5480000	The only big difference is that they added a 32-bit RISC CPU.
5480000	5491000	It actually, as a console, Famicon Tsushin gave it an 18 out of 40.
5491000	5494000	So not very good review.
5494000	5497000	And also, it didn't have a polygon graphic processor.
5497000	5499000	So it really...
5499000	5501000	I just, ew.
5501000	5502000	Yeah.
5502000	5504000	Probably held it back a little bit.
5504000	5509000	And their reasoning for this was that they were relatively low-powered and it would make everything look blocky.
5509000	5514000	Which, I mean, yeah, that's pretty much what 3D graphics were at the time, right?
5514000	5521000	But the target audience was supposed to be basically the ones who had grown up with the PC Engine.
5521000	5526000	So they were looking for basically five years older than the standard PC Engine user at the time.
5526000	5531000	And, of course, NEC and Hudson Soft had been in bed for, like, ever.
5531000	5534000	So they were really relying on Hudson to do a lot of games.
5534000	5541000	But really, the biggest things that came out were just different anime franchises.
5541000	5546000	So that's why if you look at the list of the games, it's all like...
5546000	5548000	Like, there's like two Zenki games.
5548000	5552000	There's a Cutie Honey game, which I think I linked to the Cutie Honey music in the background.
5552000	5561000	Just basically all of that era of 90s anime out at the time ended up somehow or another making it into a game.
5562000	5569000	It also... a lot of the... with the PC-FX, they also did have computer versions of it.
5569000	5572000	Like the NEC PC-98.
5573000	5577000	So it was a built... you could get it as a built-in card for your PC.
5578000	5580000	Some pretty interesting stuff.
5580000	5585000	I mean, it's... yeah, the hardware's just really not exciting for its day.
5586000	5590000	And the total games released were 62.
5591000	5593000	Only 62 games that came out for this system.
5594000	5597000	I think the only thing that's done worse was, like, what, the Engager?
5597000	5600000	No, because there was the Super Graphics.
5600000	5604000	And I think there were only eight games for the Super... six or eight games for the Super Graphics.
5604000	5606000	How many games for the Pippin?
5607000	5608000	Girl.
5608000	5612000	But anyway, though, it really is, though, a unique system.
5612000	5619000	And for... you know, I'll admit this, I went and got plenty of Saturn games, you know, based off of anime I was into at the time.
5619000	5627000	Like, I've got the Utena game and Blue Seed and... just a handful of them.
5627000	5634000	But at the same time, you know, there is one thing, though, that I do super like about this is that...
5634000	5637000	I'm trying to go back and find the picture so I can describe it.
5637000	5640000	I like the controller on it because the controller is...
5641000	5649000	It looks like it's a slightly more comfortable version, I think, of the six button turbo pad that we got for the Turbo Graphics.
5652000	5659000	Let me go through some of the games on here just to, you know, list for people the general thing.
5659000	5663000	I mean, you had... you know, for anime stuff, you had Amigami-sama.
5663000	5668000	You had... there was actually a series of anime freak games.
5668000	5674000	There was... let's see if you... there was Cutie Honey.
5674000	5680000	There was Zenki, Galaxy Fallen Yuna.
5681000	5685000	There was Little Red Riding Hood Cha-Cha there.
5685000	5689000	But for me, for some other games on here, though, we had...
5689000	5696000	There was... All Japan Women's Pro Wrestling Queen of Queens was another one on there.
5696000	5701000	There were a few, but mostly, though, from what I noticed, like, just a lot of, you know, interesting platformer games.
5701000	5706000	Yeah, there was even a Tenchi game, just looking over the list.
5706000	5708000	Voice Paradise. Yeah.
5708000	5712000	So, yeah, not too many impressive things. Oh, and a Mahjong game.
5713000	5716000	So, not too many really impressive things on there.
5716000	5723000	But it's worth noting that it was NEC's last foray into console development.
5723000	5727000	So... and there you have it. The PC-FX.
5727000	5730000	Your classic console of the month. The PC-FX.
5730000	5731000	Yerp.
5731000	5733000	Alright, go buy one today. Just kidding.
5733000	5735000	Go buy me one today.
5736000	5742000	I just really want it more for the novelty, although if I was looking at that in a Duo RX, I'd get a Duo RX any day.
5743000	5746000	Alright, we are going to take a quick break, but don't go anywhere.
5746000	5751000	We have plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come, including your calls and all that over on Skype.
5751000	5754000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
5754000	5758000	We also have some more news, including a new hack for the NES Classic. That'll be a good time.
5758000	5762000	And, of course, Dark Soccer wants to talk about Mass Effect Andromeda.
5762000	5764000	It probably involves butts.
5765000	5766000	It might not.
5766000	5767000	Alien butts.
5767000	5772000	Alright, we'll be back after this quick break with more of Orange Lounge Radio. Stay tuned.
5777000	5786000	Hi, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 675, already in progress for this February the 12th of 2017.
5786000	5789000	Happy Valentine's Day, I suppose.
5789000	5792000	Or Single Awareness Day, whatever the case may be.
5792000	5798000	You know what, just whatever your relationship status is, just go eat some chocolate.
5798000	5802000	Or don't. If you don't want to support the chocolate industry, then don't. I don't care what you do.
5802000	5805000	Make sure that they don't employ child slaves.
5805000	5808000	Are there chocolate companies that do that? I hope not.
5808000	5809000	Plenty of them, actually.
5809000	5810000	Oh, God.
5810000	5811000	Hershey's is one.
5811000	5812000	Is nothing sacred anymore?
5812000	5813000	Like Willy Wonka.
5813000	5816000	Is there anything not problematic in the world that I could enjoy?
5816000	5818000	I would just be great.
5818000	5819000	Rob.
5819000	5820000	What?
5820000	5823000	What must be done with knowledge and vigilance?
5823000	5830000	Well, sometimes when I'm shopping at the dollar store for candy, I'm not exactly in my most knowledgeable or diligent mood.
5830000	5833000	It's just, right?
5833000	5834000	Alright, anyway.
5834000	5842000	Speaking of the dollar store, I had heard, I had not checked locally myself, but one of my friends gave me like a heads up type of thing.
5842000	5851000	That like those Lego dimensions sets that were like $15 at the time they came out were being found at the dollar store for a dollar.
5851000	5853000	So like some of that stuff is like ending up on super clearance.
5853000	5856000	I did not see that at the dollar store when I was there yesterday.
5856000	5859000	I did not see that at the dollar store when I likewise was there yesterday.
5859000	5865000	Of course, there's a dollar store in every other corner. So, you know, it might just be one brand versus another.
5865000	5867000	It's Legos. I would buy them for a dollar. I'd buy that for a dollar.
5867000	5869000	I'd buy that for a dollar.
5869000	5875000	Hey, so something else before we get into rapid fire news tonight. Something else I've been getting, I guess, told about a lot this week.
5875000	5879000	Because I know it's sad, but I don't really follow a lot of this anymore.
5879000	5886000	But, you know, obviously our show was founded because we were all playing DDR together at the arcade.
5886000	5890000	And, you know, we had a show about the community about that for a long time.
5890000	5897000	And I kind of feel like the video game company that was making DDR kind of abandoned it for a little while.
5897000	5902000	Like for years, not doing anything new with it. And then, you know, now it's kind of coming back in the past few years.
5902000	5906000	But it's kind of one of those things where it's like, yeah, they kind of lost me, you know, at that point.
5906000	5909000	When they kind of, I feel like they kind of turned their back on it for a little while.
5909000	5916000	But anyway, all my personal feelings about that aside, the reality is I don't follow this scene as much as I used to.
5916000	5924000	But I know a lot of you guys do. And I'm sure a lot of you were taking a look at the whole DDR World Championships that were going on this weekend.
5924000	5929000	Specifically, it was the Konami Arcade Championship. And I guess it was the sixth annual that they were doing.
5929000	5935000	And it was part of the Japan Amusement Expo. So they did the DDR World Championships.
5935000	5941000	And what made this particularly notable was that they actually had some Americans join in the competition.
5941000	5949000	And IAmChrisForLife, who's one of the Americans who qualified for this, actually won the whole damn thing.
5949000	5955000	So there it is. And it was all streamed online. People were watching this.
5955000	5964000	And I was just thinking like, man, how awesome this would have been in like 2007 when we were kind of changing.
5964000	5967000	No, 2006, we were kind of changing direction on our show a little bit.
5967000	5971000	Like, I would have loved to be commentating on this and doing more with this.
5971000	5977000	For me, it honestly feels like 10 years too late. However, again, I'm not knocking it.
5977000	5984000	I think it's great that like a newer generation or so to speak, like can still have DDR and that it does have a place and is a thing.
5984000	5993000	And we kind of see a resurgence of it coming up because of places like round one, Dave and Busters that are trying to keep the arcade thing going in America.
5993000	6001000	So for that, I think that's really cool. And pretty nifty, Nito, that the first time Americans go to the competition, they end up taking the trophy.
6001000	6011000	So I think, Nito, how many countries in all participate in this? Is it like, I know a Korean guy had won for the past couple years.
6011000	6016000	I'm sure Japan, the US now. I'm sure there's gonna be other countries too. But is this like, is this a full on Olympics?
6016000	6021000	Do we have, you know, over 100 countries represented or is it just maybe a handful? I don't know.
6021000	6028000	But anyhow, they were, I guess, showing the actual courses they had to play and some of the songs.
6028000	6037000	And what's funny is that some of the songs I recognize, like Dead End, right? And Paranoia Revolution, or just it must be another Paranoia rebirth.
6037000	6049000	But Dead End was the groove radar special. So that means it was a different version than what I remember in good old DDR USA mix back at Roseville Golf Land, which actually had Dead End in it.
6049000	6060000	And then a song called Egoism 440 was also in it. I don't know what that is. And then what's sad is that I see the guy, I Am Chris For Life, getting his trophy and he looks all happy and, you know, as he should be.
6060000	6071000	And then it's DDR's main composer, Yulchi Asami, was presenting him the trophy. And I'm like, who is she though? I have no idea who this person is.
6071000	6083000	And it's kind of sad. Like, I actually don't know who this person is. I remember when Naoki would have been the one handing over the trophy. But, you know, people move on. There's new things to do. What have you.
6084000	6106000	All right. Let's move on and get into some rapid fire news. I had to acknowledge that because, you know, the roots of the show are in DDR. And, you know, it is cool that even though some of us have fallen out of love with it when Konami kind of wasn't doing anything with it for years, that it can still be there. Anyway, let's move on with some rapid fire news. Loki.
6106000	6122000	All right. So I'm kind of happy that, granted, a lot of foreign episodes from Liberty City are now part of the backwards compatibility for Xbox One. That almost gives me a reason to pick up an Xbox One to go back and play those again. But, yep, that's pretty cool.
6123000	6146000	So check those out if you haven't done so already. And then come along with that. I have an old game coming back. TimeSplitters. They're going to be doing a remake of the original game called TimeSplitters Rewind. And they had a teaser that came out for that. Apparently now it's scheduled to come out maybe in 2018.
6147000	6162000	But no real words on what exactly it's going to be. But I'm happy that TimeSplitters is coming. And it's a fan-made project, but it's got the go-ahead from Crytek, who owns the right TimeSplitters right now.
6162000	6173000	That's good. Getting that go-ahead is good because otherwise you get a season desist. So, you know, Nintendo would probably not be giving any go-aheads anytime soon. But something like TimeSplitters, a little different. So, cool.
6173000	6181000	Tekken 7. I'm sure some of you guys are looking forward to. And Tekken 7 will be coming out on the PlayStation 4 as well as the Xbox One.
6181000	6192000	But we have some of the details on the PlayStation 4 release. There's going to be a collector's edition that will have a 12x18-inch figure of Heihachi and Kazuya that are fighting. They're punching each other in the face.
6192000	6206000	There's also a steelbook and a Tekken 7 soundtrack. There's going to be an exclusive jukebox mode in the PlayStation 4 version of the game, which will let you play songs from all versions of the game series in a mix while you play the game.
6206000	6218000	So you could, I guess, jam to Tekken 3's soundtrack while you play Tekken 7 if you want. There's also going to be some exclusive costumes for certain characters from Tekken 4 and Tekken 2, so you can kind of see characters in their classic styles.
6218000	6222000	No word yet on what Microsoft's exclusives will be, if any.
6222000	6238000	Moving over to Nintendo for a bit. One of the launch titles for the Nintendo Switch that we were saying here on OLR a few weeks ago, that in our humble opinion really should have just been the damn pack-in game, but Nintendo's doing something different with it. We'll see if the risk pays off.
6238000	6250000	1-2 Switch is the game I'm referring to. Nintendo of Japan confirmed this week that there will be 28 minigames in 1-2 Switch. That's the number of minigames there will be, so it's more than like seven, so I guess that's kind of cool.
6250000	6254000	Some of the minigames include Wizard and Baby.
6254000	6259000	Yes, I'm watching the video for Baby right now. This looks fucking stupid.
6259000	6262000	I'm watching the trailer for Baby right now here.
6262000	6274000	So you actually hold the Switch like it's a baby, and there's a crying face on it, and I guess you rock it up and down, and it will go to sleep.
6274000	6276000	That's just my face with an actual baby.
6276000	6290000	This is kind of creepy, actually. Well, now what happens if you do bad? What happens if you shake the baby? Which you should never do. It's a bad thing, but I have to ask the question. What happens if you shake the baby?
6291000	6293000	Does the baby cry more? It dies.
6293000	6297000	That would be kind of morbid, though, for a Nintendo game, wouldn't it? Don't do that.
6297000	6303000	And then the wizard looks dumb, too, but it looks like they're doing the wizarding battles of Harry Potter.
6303000	6304000	Okay, that's kind of cool, though.
6304000	6309000	It's just lame, though. I'm sorry. This looks so dumb. It's so dumb.
6309000	6314000	But Loki! Baby! It's a game called Baby!
6314000	6331000	Yes, because what parents want to do when they're not with their children is fucking pretend to have their children. No. It's dumb. Why did someone put any effort into that minigame? Seriously. Where is the fun in it?
6331000	6346000	Well, look at that dumbass. He's really rocking that controller like it's a baby. Oh my god, that's so fucking hilarious. I'm so drunk. I mean, it's so... This game should fucking die in a fire. It's absolute garbage.
6348000	6352000	Alright, let's move on. Some more rapid-fire news, Dark Sakura.
6353000	6378000	Well, Bethesda's got some sales going on this weekend, which is pretty much over now, but oh well. Dishonored 2, Elder Scrolls V Skyrim, the special edition, Elder Scrolls Online is also on sale, Morrowind is on sale, Doom is on sale, Fallout 4 with the season pass is on sale for almost half price.
6378000	6387000	So, if you're listening live, go get them. They're cheaper. It's actually going to be going on through Monday the 13th, so you got a little bit of leeway.
6387000	6410000	And then, some news on the Marvel edge. Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 is actually when the Evo 2017 fan selection. So, guess what? You can play it now at Evo if you go. And if you don't go, watch it and don't suck.
6411000	6413000	Just play it at home. Play your home version.
6413000	6431000	But they tried to get Pokken Tournament added. And Killer Instinct. So, Pokken Tournament won like $67,000 in donations, but Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 took it with $71,690.
6432000	6433000	That's still pretty close.
6434000	6439000	They should have just done both. Let the Pokken nerds have their time. Come on. Alright, fine.
6441000	6450000	Actdeftinchat says, Pokken, fuck UMVC3. See, some people are very upset about this whole situation. Why not just have room for both? Oh well.
6451000	6452000	Deadpool is not in Pokken.
6453000	6462000	How many versions of Smash are they doing at Evo? Couldn't they replace one of the versions of Smash with Pokken? I know that might be sacrilegious, what I'm saying, but come on. How many versions of Smash need to be there?
6463000	6464000	Anyway.
6465000	6466000	Fifty.
6467000	6473000	Moving on, let's travel around and check out what's in stores this week. Is UMVC4 out yet, Loki, this week?
6474000	6475000	No. That's infinite, remember?
6476000	6477000	Oh, I'm sorry.
6478000	6486000	No, there's not that. But there are four different games I have on my list here. So, starting off with Deformers. That's on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
6487000	6490000	I see what you did there. Deformers. Because there's four games.
6490000	6493000	Four. That wasn't intentional, I'm sorry.
6494000	6498000	For Honor. Hey, all these games have fours in them today.
6499000	6506000	On PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. Sniper Elite 4 on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
6507000	6511000	And sadly, the one that just has to fuckin' be different, Ride 2 on PlayStation 4.
6512000	6513000	No, it's now Ride 4.
6514000	6515000	It's now Ride 4.
6516000	6519000	Ride 2, 4, Ride 2, and 3 never happened. They were cancelled.
6520000	6521000	This is Ride 4.
6524000	6528000	Alright, traveling over to Japan, and on the 16th this week, you can also get For Honor out there.
6529000	6535000	But you can also get Sango Kushi 13 that apparently comes with a power-up kit.
6536000	6541000	That is something that's available as well. Oh, it must be like an online thing. That's what this is.
6542000	6548000	It's one of those, like, Romance of the Three Kingdoms-looking games, and so I'm guessing the power-up kit is something that gets you stuff online.
6548000	6549000	Cup of noodles.
6550000	6551000	It's not cup noodles.
6552000	6558000	There's also Momo 2G Taisen Ryoku comes out in Japan this week in a regular and a premium edition.
6559000	6561000	So that is something to look forward to on PlayStation 4.
6562000	6567000	And then Digimon World Next Order International Edition is also out this week.
6568000	6570000	So maybe that's something Dark Sakura will be importing. I don't know.
6571000	6572000	I don't know her life.
6573000	6588000	Going over to the Vita, Momo 2G Taisen Ryoku 3 is also out on the Vita, as well as Kamaitachi no Yoru Rene Saisei, and Diabolic Lovers Lost Eden in regular and limited edition out on the Vita this week.
6589000	6597000	And on the 3DS this week, nothing. There's nothing on the 3DS until March 2nd is the next release date over there.
6598000	6600000	Let's go to the UK, Dark Sakura.
6600000	6618000	In the UK, we have on the 16th Layers of Fear for Mac, we have The Escapist The Walking Dead for PlayStation 4, and on the 17th we have Californium for Mac and PC, and Rainbow Moon for PlayStation 4.
6619000	6620000	Swell.
6621000	6623000	Yeah, but the swelling's gone down.
6623000	6624000	The swelling's gone down.
6625000	6631000	Alright, let's go to the mailbag. Every week you guys email us. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
6632000	6639000	And Dark Sakura likes to jump into the mailbag, which she surely logged into before the show to be well prepared for tonight.
6640000	6644000	And she pulls out an email or five to read on the show.
6645000	6649000	One, I almost said one lousy email, but I'm sure it's a great email.
6650000	6651000	But it's just lousy that we only got one.
6651000	6652000	We don't read the lousy ones.
6653000	6658000	That's true. So anyway, let's get to it. Here's the email tonight. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
6659000	6667000	Hey OLR crew, AZHP here with another report on the Nintendo Switch. I got to try it out after the Zelda escape game, which was fun.
6668000	6677000	A little on the easy side for an escape game with between a 30-40% escape rate, whereas the other rooms from this company are closer to 5-15%.
6677000	6682000	After the escape game was over, people who cleared the game were able to try a 20 minute demo.
6683000	6691000	The kiosk I was on had the same muddy texture problem that Stoppy talked about on the Skype call last week.
6692000	6700000	However, after finishing my demo, I noticed my friend's kiosk had perfectly crisp 1080p textures that looked better than PS3.
6701000	6706000	I told an attendant about that and she thanked me for notifying them of the problem and said they would need to fix a TV setting.
6707000	6718000	My guess is that it wasn't a TV setting, but the Switch was stuck in a portable mode of some sort which downscaled the resolution and it didn't switch properly when docked to the TV.
6719000	6721000	Interesting. It didn't switch.
6722000	6736000	Hopefully this is a problem Nintendo will fix before the release, because if people like Stoppy and I are going to receive these types of experiences and then speak on social media or podcasts about it without realizing that the Switch actually can output really tight graphics,
6737000	6739000	it's going to harm the perception of the Switch.
6740000	6743000	God, just imagine if that was the E3 for 15,000 strangers to go play.
6744000	6754000	Right. With that being said, my other gripe with the system is that the analog nubs feel almost like the PSP analog nub and that there isn't a whole lot of nuance or precision you can apply to the stick.
6754000	6769000	If you've used a PSP before, you probably know what I'm talking about, but where you can't really input a walk rather than a run, it's basically all or nothing because there isn't a lot of space between 0 and 100% on the stick.
6770000	6774000	Hopefully that makes sense. So basically it's not very sensitive.
6775000	6781000	Or it seems like it's such a small controller there's no space between pedal to the metal.
6782000	6783000	You need a lot of fine motor control.
6784000	6790000	You could get one of these really stupid add-ons that you would stick on top of it to raise the height of it so that you can do that.
6791000	6793000	You'll need to play with some nipples to practice.
6794000	6796000	You could just have small hands, like somebody.
6799000	6801000	Built for Trump, good for gamers.
6802000	6803000	Anyway...
6804000	6813000	I'm still hopeful about the Switch, but I'm still not going to pre-order one since I'll probably enjoy playing on the Wii U gamepad more than the Switch gamepad given my demo experience.
6814000	6822000	And if the muddy texture problem is something that doesn't get fixed soon before or after launch, that's going to be a really big problem for people.
6828000	6833000	I'm trying to get the phrasing on this one, so I guess imagine if the difference between a Wii or even the game...
6834000	6836000	It's phrased funny, so I'll just say it as it's written.
6837000	6842000	It imagined the difference between a Wii or even GameCube game and a PS3 game.
6842000	6843000	It was that dramatic.
6844000	6848000	Anyway, hopefully you've all found this email helpful. I have.
6849000	6853000	I'm writing it on my phone since the power is out due to the storms we've been having in the Bay Area.
6854000	6856000	Take care everyone, you're truly AZHP.
6857000	6865000	Thank you, I'm happy to be hearing from people that are getting their hands on this thing around the country as they've been doing that Nintendo Switch tour.
6866000	6869000	And I heard about the whole escape room, which I totally forgot was happening in San Francisco.
6869000	6873000	I wanted to go do it, but I'm sure it was a lot of people.
6874000	6875000	Was it the Resident Evil one?
6876000	6878000	No, there was a Zelda-themed escape room.
6879000	6882000	I've had a busy month, so I didn't get around to doing it.
6883000	6892000	I think the Switch tour is going to be in San Francisco at the end of the month, but I'm kind of like, well at that point it's like one week until the Switch releases, so what's the point?
6892000	6899000	I don't want to go have to fight all those crazy Nintendo fans and stand in line for a few hours to play something that I will be playing anyway in one week.
6900000	6901000	I can wait. I can wait.
6902000	6906000	But it is weird to think we're only a couple weeks from the Switch release.
6907000	6909000	We're what, like three episodes away from the Switch release?
6910000	6911000	It's crazy.
6912000	6914000	Coming out of nowhere at the same time.
6915000	6919000	JD in chat says it's coming back, there's still an opportunity to do the room.
6919000	6927000	Oh, that's good. I want to, yeah, come on Nogust in chat says the room is coming back to March, coming back in March to Japantown.
6928000	6930000	Maybe I'll have to go then. That'd be fun.
6931000	6937000	Just to do the escape room, obviously in March the Zelda demo part won't even matter, but I think the escape room thing would be fun.
6938000	6939000	Alright.
6940000	6944000	Well that's it for emails. Participate at orangelandtrader.com if you want to send us an email for a future week.
6945000	6947000	In the meantime, we're going to get to Loki and then we're going to get some calls. Loki.
6947000	6954000	Alright, so let's talk a little bit about Activision. They had their investors meeting and released some numbers.
6955000	6963000	So they brought in $6.6 billion in 2016. I'm assuming most of that is from Blizzard.
6964000	6973000	Let's see here. That's a 42% increase. They're saying that, of course, Call of Duty and Overwatch were a big part of that.
6973000	6987000	And they're, of course, touting that they had 447 million players. I guess users spent over 43 billion hours consuming Activision Blizzard content.
6988000	6990000	Alright, good for them I guess.
6991000	6998000	With that also, of course, this year in 2017 there's not going to be a new Skylanders game, which is good because I think it's getting very stale.
6998000	7003000	I think it's been stale for a while now and so they're taking the year off because, I don't know.
7004000	7009000	But they're going to have a new season of Skylanders Academy. If you give a shit about that, I sure as hell know.
7010000	7016000	In fact, I've tried to pitch it to my kids saying, hey, you want to watch this? And they're like, nope. I have no interest in that show.
7017000	7019000	And so I'm like, okay, cool. Don't have to worry about it.
7020000	7032000	And also, along the lines of that, Call of Duty, they're kind of reeling it back in. So this year it's not going to be ridiculous space combat, but more traditional combat.
7033000	7041000	So they're not going all sci-fi. Probably copying the whole EA success with Battlefield 1, so we'll see.
7042000	7045000	I'm glad Skylanders is taking a fucking break. I think they need it this year.
7045000	7050000	Yeah, that thing's been driven into the ground for a while now and it's just ridiculous. I don't know.
7051000	7061000	I just wish the whole Toys for Life thing was cheaper, but the one I want is Lego and Lego ain't getting cheaper ever.
7062000	7072000	Well, except for the discount I mentioned earlier. My friend said exactly what store it was. I'll tell you where the dollar store is that she saw them at, but I don't know if they'll still be there.
7072000	7079000	Can't guarantee that. But maybe even places like, not even dollar store, but like big lots. Like there's a big lot that's not far from here.
7080000	7088000	I was so pissed. Like they had like a $12, like they have these little kid sets that they have sometimes for like Marvel stuff. They had one that had Lego Loki in there and I was like, ooh, I should pick that up.
7089000	7097000	And I neglected to do that. Now they don't sell it anymore. And that pisses me off because I can't get it now. I'll look online.
7097000	7111000	All right. Well, uh, if you have an NES classic, which I guess more of them showed up, I saw suddenly on Friday, like I saw a bunch of people on Twitter were suddenly going like, oh, I got mine today. So I guess another wave must have hit this week.
7112000	7115000	I check every now and then when I'm in a department store and see the electronics section.
7116000	7125000	You guys know how I feel about it. I can kind of give her to, if one happens to show up at the house. Sure. I'll play it. I'll use the office. We will do some live streaming with it, but I'm not really thrilled to get one.
7126000	7133000	So, but actually then I hear about this kind of stuff and I'm like, okay, well that's pretty cool. Maybe I want to buy one just to fuck with it. Like everybody else has been doing.
7133000	7146000	Uh, and sure enough, you know, hackers going to hack and that's what's happened this week. Um, so, uh, there's a big community of NES classic modders on Reddit because of course Reddit is a place where a lot of people kind of converge.
7147000	7161000	There's a Reddit called NES classic mods that's available. And, um, there's stuff there on, I haven't, no, I haven't really gone and really dug into the Reddit myself a lot, but as I understand it, there is a tools there for hacking the system.
7161000	7189000	Uh, and apparently things like hacking the NES classic to run ROMs of games made for other consoles. And there's a YouTube out there now where the NES classic emulates things like Metroid 2 Return of Samus on the Game Boy, The Legend of Zelda Link's Awakening on the Game Boy Color, Pitfall on the Atari 2600, Sonic the Hedgehog on the Sega Genesis, and Super Metroid on the Super Nintendo.
7189000	7205000	Meaning that little chip that's powering the NES classic is good enough to be running Super Nintendo games, which really isn't that surprising. I mean, it's a Linux PC. Yeah. Yeah. And you consider like, what are those, what do they call the things you, the tiny, tiny, tiny computers you get for like 30 bucks?
7205000	7206000	Raspberry Pi.
7206000	7216000	That's it. Raspberry Pi. Like a Raspberry Pi can fucking around Super Nintendo games at full speed on it. So why can't the NES classic? And you're right. They're just basically little tiny Linux computers. Like it's basically a Raspberry Pi type of thing.
7216000	7222000	And, you know, where, where, where there is technology, Linux will be installed on it.
7222000	7223000	If it's not already.
7223000	7241000	If it's not already. Uh, and I'm sure Linux is then the way that you get all these emulators and so forth. Uh, so yeah. Uh, these, uh, these programs are, were put in with, uh, what's called Hack Chi 2, uh, which several NES classic modders came together to build.
7241000	7253000	Uh, they say it's actually relatively easy to install and let you put all kinds of games on the NES classic. So Loki is currently in the computer looking, so have fun.
7253000	7255000	Oh no, I was just looking at something else.
7255000	7262000	Gotcha. But, um, yeah, so when you get your NES classic, Loki, are you planning to put a bunch of other crap?
7262000	7266000	Uh, yes, of course. That's really the main reason I want it.
7267000	7277000	All right. All right. So, uh, yeah, we'll see, uh, if Loki gets his hands on one or if I just decide to finally fricking jump and get one, we'll see.
7277000	7282000	Anyway, Dark Sakura, you got no time for the NES classic though, cause you have other things to look forward to, right?
7282000	7284000	I got alien butt.
7284000	7292000	Um, Mass Effect Andromeda is supposed to have customizable characters for multiplayer.
7292000	7307000	So instead of just having whatever is there or, you know, give your Krogan pink armor and call her Krogal, like I might have done, or, you know, uh, a Drell named Kermit.
7307000	7309000	A very limited palette, basically.
7309000	7316000	Yeah, very. Um, that you are supposed to be getting a little bit more customization for your multiplayer. So that's pretty cool.
7316000	7329000	I mean, I did kind of like how Dragon Age Inquisition did their multiplayer, that you just had preset characters that you could play as and they were their own character with their own story that actually had an effect in the game.
7329000	7342000	They were, you would send them on missions and Isabella was in there. Anyway, so, um, they haven't really given too much about this, but say that, um, it's going to be, uh, certainly a bit better.
7342000	7363000	So, and of course we're going to find out in March when the game is released. Also, um, they're also pretty certain that, uh, some of the regular multiplayer characters as well have alternate skins and that you might be able to put them through, um, uh, cosmetic changes with transactions.
7363000	7370000	Not microtransactions. Even a tenth of a cent is a transaction. So, bite me.
7370000	7385000	Um, also, uh, as far as, um, the romance options, PB is a romance option. She's a Dorbz. And there is a Lady Turian named Vetranix. Because Turians are the best.
7385000	7387000	So you can romance a Lady Turian this time?
7387000	7388000	You can romance a Lady Turian.
7388000	7390000	What about the, like the only human is what, Liam?
7390000	7392000	There's a few.
7392000	7395000	Well, there are women in the game, Rob.
7395000	7399000	Sorry, I have my eyes on the men.
7399000	7410000	There, there are other human characters on the team. And a Salarian. Yeah, there's, there's all over the place. I think it would be funny to romance a Krogan. That would just be funny.
7410000	7424000	Um, but anyway, um, the hope is that there may be like some kind of open beta so that people will kind of get their hands on it before and also test for things like, you know, servers and stress testing and stuff.
7424000	7429000	Well, last week there was that demo story, right? There was going to be a demo a few days before, so there's that.
7429000	7432000	That's only if you were in the early access for Origin.
7432000	7433000	Oh.
7433000	7439000	So, but it'll be out on March 21st and I will be playing it on my poor dying computer.
7439000	7443000	I was going to say, I think that's an EA club thing that you sign up for.
7443000	7444000	Oh.
7444000	7445000	Your premium.
7445000	7450000	You're not going to get that, suck that money out of me, EA. Nice try.
7450000	7451000	Nerp.
7452000	7453000	All right.
7453000	7459000	Uh, well, I'm looking forward to be able to customize my character, uh, without being limited to what I only get in loot boxes.
7459000	7464000	Although I guess some of it will still be loot boxes, but hopefully not too bad.
7464000	7466000	All right, uh, Loki, what do you have for us?
7466000	7469000	All right, so let's talk about Nataku.
7469000	7472000	Not Kotaku, but Nutaku.
7472000	7485000	And Nataku, for those who may not know, it's a hentai game website that you can download or play online hentai games and that kind of sort of stuff.
7485000	7493000	So what they're doing is they actually have their own crowdfunding platform called the Red Light crowdfunding platform.
7493000	7501000	And of course, Red Light or Kimochi is dedicated to adult games.
7501000	7505000	So you can go back different projects, including different visual novels.
7505000	7507000	That's a funny name for it too.
7507000	7508000	Kimochi?
7508000	7509000	Kimochi Red Light?
7509000	7513000	Well, Kimochi is, uh, like feelings, sensation.
7513000	7515000	So it's an apt name.
7515000	7516000	Yep.
7516000	7518000	So you can go back different projects on there.
7518000	7522000	Um, and of course, you know, teams are developing that stuff.
7522000	7526000	So like, for example, they've got, it looks like several visual novels.
7526000	7528000	There's some strategy games, some clicker games.
7528000	7530000	I'm all about clicker games.
7530000	7533000	Just what Loki needs, more clicker games.
7533000	7535000	So yeah, go check it out.
7535000	7539000	And that's it, of course, um, Kimochi.co.
7539000	7543000	That's K-I-M-O-C-H-I dot C-O.
7543000	7544000	All right.
7544000	7546000	Uh, one more story here for you guys.
7546000	7550000	Then we're going to open up the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
7550000	7557000	Uh, and that is a brand new update for Super Nintendo's NBA Jam Tournament Edition.
7557000	7560000	Obviously, this is an unofficial update.
7560000	7567000	But, uh, apparently somebody has put together a ROM hack for NBA Jam Tournament Edition on the Super Nintendo,
7567000	7572000	which it doesn't really affect the gameplay, but what it does is it affects some of the game rosters,
7572000	7579000	so that you can actually use players in the new NBA Jam Tournament, uh, or this newer NBA Jam Tournament Edition that's been hacked.
7579000	7583000	You can use players that are actually out there now, like LeBron James.
7583000	7589000	Um, and then you also get teams that were not in the original game, Toronto, Memphis, and so forth.
7589000	7593000	Uh, so all the players have had their attributes edited to match their current abilities.
7593000	7599000	Uh, and then you can also unlock NBA legends, like Kobe Bryant, Michael Jordan, and so forth.
7599000	7600000	So that's pretty cool.
7600000	7609000	And in the classic style of NBA Jam, there are also pop culture and political characters that can be unlocked.
7609000	7616000	So you, you know, like, cause remember in the old, uh, 91 or 92 NBA Jam, when it first came out, you could play as Bill Clinton, right?
7616000	7617000	Yes.
7617000	7620000	You could play that and, uh, so you could like unlock, uh, political figures.
7620000	7628000	So of course, uh, now in NBA Jam 2K17, you can unlock Donald Trump and you can unlock Hillary Clinton.
7628000	7632000	So you can fight that battle all over again if you like.
7632000	7639000	But if politics isn't your thing, you could also unlock characters like Kanye West and Harambe.
7644000	7646000	Because of course...
7646000	7648000	He's not going to move very fast cause he's dead.
7648000	7652000	Because of course it's on the internet.
7652000	7655000	So somebody fucking put Harambe in it.
7655000	7659000	So there you go. That is all a ROM hack.
7659000	7663000	So it's very unofficial and not going to be supported in any official capacity.
7663000	7669000	But I'm sure there's some people that will be downloading this and probably putting it on their NES Classic Minis now at this point.
7670000	7675000	And there's so many people in chat that are like, God damn it. God damn it.
7675000	7679000	This is why we can't have nice things in response to the whole, uh, Harambe, uh, being in the game.
7679000	7681000	So there you go.
7681000	7687000	Uh, anyhow, let's open up the Skype line over at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
7687000	7689000	That's Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
7689000	7692000	Uh, Loki, while we wait for some calls, do you have any last minute news you want to get out?
7692000	7694000	I don't.
7694000	7695000	What?
7695000	7696000	Sorry.
7696000	7697000	Wow, we must have covered all the bases tonight.
7697000	7699000	Well, we do have some calls coming in, so let's get to it.
7699000	7701000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
7701000	7703000	Hey, this is Akdeft.
7703000	7705000	Hey, Akdeft. How you doing, buddy?
7705000	7707000	Uh, kind of good. Kind of good.
7707000	7709000	Good. What's up?
7709000	7715000	Well, um, I want to talk about, uh, Marvel vs Capcom 3 on an Evo.
7715000	7717000	Yeah.
7717000	7721000	Um, where do I start with this?
7721000	7727000	Marvel vs Capcom 3 is an old, really old game.
7727000	7735000	First of all, I don't know if you watched the last Evo, well, last year's Evo.
7735000	7739000	I think I saw one of the championships, but that was about it.
7739000	7745000	I think I might have seen Street Fighter 4's championship, but I didn't watch a whole lot of Evo otherwise.
7745000	7747000	Well, basically...
7747000	7751000	I'm not super into fighting games, to be fair. Like, I like them.
7751000	7757000	You know, I'll play them here and there, but I don't get into the scene like other people do, if that makes sense.
7757000	7765000	Yeah, yeah. Basically, to give some context, last year, if I remember correctly,
7765000	7773000	Marvel vs Capcom 3 had the lowest participant account last year.
7773000	7783000	Like, they had, I don't remember if just over 500, maybe less than 1,000, but I don't remember exactly.
7783000	7796000	Even games that aren't as popular like Killer Instinct, I think Mortal Kombat had more participants that year than Marvel vs Capcom did.
7796000	7799000	Because, again, that game is old.
7799000	7813000	The tiers don't change that much. I think they pretty much use the same three or four characters over and over again.
7813000	7819000	And it's just boring to watch. It's boring. It got boring to watch.
7819000	7832000	Okay, I'm gonna ask a tough question here, though, because knowing that you're a fan of Pokken, and knowing that Pokken narrowly lost the spot to UMVC 3, is this bitter feelings here?
7832000	7837000	Are you only dumping on UMVC 3 because you're really mad it's not Pokken?
7838000	7859000	You know, I know I'm a fan of Pokken. I love the game, and I would have given anything to see Pokken instead of Marvel vs Capcom, but any of the other games that they announced for the fundraiser, it would have been perfect.
7859000	7867000	I mean, there's a community for Killer Instinct that would have loved to see it again at EVO.
7867000	7871000	Well, I was gonna say Killer Instinct was in it last year, if I remember right.
7871000	7883000	But yeah, it's still getting updates and so forth, and I'm surprised even that even Killer Instinct, Microsoft at least in this part, isn't supporting it for EVO.
7884000	7893000	ARMS would have been a weird choice, but at least it would have been different. Don't know about the other games. Maybe School Girls?
7893000	7906000	I don't know, maybe it is some of the resentment, but again, there were so many other choices that they could have gone to.
7907000	7921000	And Marvel vs Capcom, I don't remember if it came out in 2011 or 2012, but again, the game is getting old, it's getting stale.
7921000	7933000	It's not even worth watching, because again, the characters won't change, the tiers won't change, it's the same strats over and over again.
7933000	7943000	At least with Pokken, you have some strategy to it, with the Rock Paper Scissors thing, but I don't know.
7944000	7962000	If I was an EVO organizer, I would have just skipped Marvel vs Capcom, because Infinite is coming next year, most possibly, and people are probably hyped about that.
7962000	7974000	I know that it's already released on the PlayStation 4, the upgraded version, the HDR version, but still.
7975000	7995000	Is there plans that you know of for a second Pokken game? I feel like this game kind of does better, especially as taking it seriously as a fighting game, than I think a lot of people anticipated originally.
7995000	8009000	But I really feel like the demand is probably there for a sequel, and the fact that maybe this is something that should be on the Switch, because again, the Wii U, having not sold a lot of units, had a more limited scope of who would play it.
8009000	8024000	Yes, I realize Pokken is in the arcades, and that's a whole other element of it, but I would think Pokken, shouldn't we be getting that on the Switch? Like a new version of it, or at least Pokken Tournament with all the extra stuff or whatever?
8024000	8040000	Yeah, and I'm going to remember an article since Pokken and Street Fighter V, I think, came out at the same time, and Pokken sold more copies than Street Fighter V at the moment.
8040000	8058000	Most possibly, I'm pretty sure it's getting a sequel, because that game pretty much sold in the Wii U, even though not many people probably played it or even know of it.
8058000	8078000	If not a sequel, at least support, because the arcade does have the updates and the new characters. So maybe an update with all the characters from the arcade in a new version, maybe?
8078000	8089000	Maybe, but I don't know if Bandai Namco wants to port it, but it would be kind of dumb not to do it.
8089000	8101000	Yeah, I really think they should take another shot at it on the Wii, and maybe even get it a bigger audience, and maybe that could make the difference to raise the money to get Pokken in it next year, if it doesn't just get in on its own merits.
8102000	8112000	Yeah, and the controls for Pokken are really simple, so you can pretty much use the Yoikons, so it wouldn't require that much work on it.
8112000	8125000	Yeah, true. Alright, well, actdeft, sorry to hear that Pokken didn't make EVO, but hopefully there'll still be plenty of Pokken content to consume out there in places like Twitch and so forth, and still a good competitive scene out there for it.
8125000	8131000	Yeah, there's at least a Pokemon Championship, so hopefully it gets its place there, but yeah.
8131000	8135000	That's true. Alright, my friend, I'm gonna let you go to get some more calls, but thanks for the call.
8135000	8136000	Hey, thanks for having me.
8136000	8137000	No problem. Bye.
8137000	8145000	OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype if you want to call in tonight. 1-877-GAMO-LR if you want to do it the old school way.
8145000	8148000	Let's get to another call. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
8148000	8150000	Hey, what's going on, everyone? It's Ranma.
8150000	8151000	Hey, Ranma, how you doing, buddy?
8151000	8154000	I'm doing pretty good. How is everybody else?
8154000	8166000	I'm good. Tired. Between Pokemon Go, and I don't know if I mentioned this on the show, but I hosted Rocky Horror last night, so that kept me up to like 1.30, so I'm tired.
8166000	8168000	Did you get some coffee at least?
8168000	8179000	Oh, God, you better believe it. I had coffee on the way to San Francisco yesterday. I had coffee this morning. I had coffee before OLR, and I'm supposed to be cutting back on coffee, but some days, that ain't gonna happen.
8179000	8181000	Now, was it Dunkin' Donuts coffee?
8181000	8192000	No, because the nearest Dunkin' Donuts is like not that close. I have to go basically all the way to Roseville or Folsom, which from where I'm at is kind of far. I know you don't even know where these places are, but they're far.
8192000	8198000	It's the other side of town. It's like going to one of the other boroughs, Ranma.
8198000	8209000	Well, I have to make sure I send you some Dunkin' Donuts coffee, because evidently, I did send you a package. It was supposed to arrive Saturday, but thanks to the post office, you won't get it until Monday.
8209000	8212000	I didn't know you sent us a package. I'm excited.
8212000	8218000	Yes, and there are explicit instructions on the package to not to open until the next show.
8218000	8225000	Oh, okay. All right. I'm excited what this could be. All right, all right.
8225000	8230000	I refuse to give a hint because you might figure it out that easily, but I wanted it as a complete and total surprise.
8230000	8232000	All right. Is it coffee?
8232000	8233000	No.
8233000	8237000	Okay. I was like, dang, I figured it out real quick.
8237000	8239000	Vacuum sealed donuts.
8239000	8251000	To be fair, I do want to point out, we can get the Dunkin' Donuts grounds at Target, so they sell that, and then the K-Cups, they sell at Baskin-Robbins, believe it or not, because it's all, I guess, the same chain or whatever.
8251000	8253000	Yeah, it's kind of the same company, yeah.
8253000	8262000	When those first came out, it wasn't that way. I remember on one of his trips out here, JV Mon brought the K-Cups before you could get them out here, but now you can get the K-Cups out here.
8262000	8271000	Especially since the whole Keurig thing really blew up in popularity, and it's like they sell those things everywhere. The Dunkin' Donuts stuff's pretty easy to find out, too.
8271000	8273000	Sounds good to me.
8273000	8275000	So what's on your mind tonight?
8275000	8278000	I want to talk about a game review.
8278000	8279000	Okay.
8279000	8282000	All right. Now, Jamie.
8282000	8284000	What?
8284000	8289000	I'm going to play a song. I want to know that you can identify this song.
8290000	8292000	Okay.
8292000	8294000	Yes.
8294000	8297000	Hot-blooded downtown story.
8297000	8301000	Or, as we had it, River City Ransom.
8301000	8306000	Yes. I want to talk about River City Ransom, Tokyo Rumble for the 3DS.
8306000	8307000	Okay.
8307000	8308000	Oh, okay.
8309000	8323000	I will say this in a nutshell. It is amazing. This is how you do a proper port with retro graphics. The soundtrack is up to date. It is amazing. This is a great game.
8323000	8329000	That's quite a compliment to it. Tell us a little more.
8329000	8337000	All right. Basically, the plot of the story is there is a new gang in town, and they're causing trouble for Kunio and his crew.
8337000	8345000	So Kunio decides it's best to find some of his friends who run other gangs to run this main gang out of town.
8345000	8352000	It's your basic side-scrolling, punch-kicking. Now you can do three buttons, so you can actually jump, punch, jump, kick.
8352000	8357000	You can still pick up all of the classic items from the original game, plus you can level up your character.
8357000	8358000	Well, that's pretty cool.
8358000	8367000	And you get the option of switching between multiple characters throughout the game to level them up. You can buy clothing for better, for armor, for weaponry.
8367000	8373000	And you can do unlockable minigames such as dodgeball and, I believe, basketball.
8373000	8375000	That sounds fun.
8375000	8376000	Yeah, it sounds super fun.
8377000	8384000	And the best part is it's just the original game. They just translated it and left all the original voices intact.
8384000	8387000	So it's just like playing the original NES version in a way.
8387000	8390000	Fun. Do they barf?
8390000	8391000	Yes, they do.
8391000	8392000	Awesome.
8392000	8395000	Some of the characters do barf.
8395000	8396000	Rad.
8396000	8403000	And what's cool is you still hear that sound effect when you defeat them, plus there's an audio effect of them barfing.
8403000	8405000	Fabulous. Fabulous.
8405000	8408000	It's not the same if there's no barf.
8408000	8412000	Any type of street passing or multiplayer involved, since it's 3DS?
8412000	8420000	Not to my knowledge, because I think I'm the only one in my area with the game, so I haven't gotten anything to pop up in regards to it.
8420000	8428000	Alright, well that's okay. I was just curious if that was a feature, since it is 3DS and that's something we're doing on that system.
8428000	8429000	Definitely.
8430000	8437000	I know there is two versions. There's the regular version, then there's the limited edition, which comes with a Kunio keychain.
8437000	8440000	And I got lucky and got it for $34.99 online.
8440000	8441000	Nice!
8441000	8442000	Not bad.
8442000	8446000	Yeah, I believe I actually linked you to that once.
8446000	8447000	Did you?
8447000	8448000	Yes.
8448000	8450000	Okay. Sorry.
8450000	8452000	Way to stay on top of all your messages, Dark Soccer.
8452000	8454000	You know what?
8454000	8459000	I wonder if it's on the eShop. If I just want to be lazy and play it tonight, get it on the eShop. I'll have to look.
8459000	8460000	You know what?
8460000	8468000	It might be, but you know what? This is one of those games that's worth having a physical copy, because I believe only a limited print of these is going out.
8468000	8470000	Mmm.
8477000	8479000	Agreed. They didn't get it.
8479000	8484000	They probably had somebody that was too young when River City Ransom first came out to really appreciate it.
8484000	8494000	Yes, and I will say as much about the original. This was one of those games I would sit there and play it all damn day, because I did not care for that password screen.
8494000	8501000	I'm like, I'm just going to play, pause the game, come back, and keep playing, and just pray that my NES doesn't freeze.
8501000	8506000	Well, video games are supposed to be fun, and if you're having fun with the game, then more power to you.
8506000	8507000	Mm-hmm.
8507000	8508000	Yeah.
8508000	8512000	Alright, my friend, I'm going to let you go to try to get maybe one more call before we wrap up for the night.
8512000	8513000	Awesome.
8513000	8514000	Thank you. You take care.
8514000	8515000	You too.
8515000	8516000	Alright, bye.
8516000	8523000	OrangeLoungeRadio. All one word on Skype. If you want to do it the old school way, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8523000	8524000	Let's see.
8524000	8531000	Oh, Dark Tetsuya says, actually, I meant Double Dragon 4. I don't know what IGN gave River City Ransom 3DS in all fairness.
8532000	8539000	That's a correction there from what I said in chat from Dark Tetsuya, because Dark Tetsuya had said before that in related news, I'm kind of curious about Double Dragon 4.
8539000	8541000	That's what else we played at my house, by the way.
8541000	8542000	Yeah.
8542000	8543000	It was Double Dragon 4.
8543000	8552000	But my response would honestly still apply. It could still be somebody too young to recall the original Double Dragon and kind of, you know, playing that on the NES.
8552000	8556000	I don't think those games hold up well over time. That's me personally.
8556000	8561000	But, DarkSakura, you guys, did Dan get Double Dragon 4? Have you guys been playing that at all?
8561000	8571000	Yeah, Dan actually finally beat it by using a Bobo, or as I've been calling him, a Dobo, because I've been hungry for Filipino food lately.
8571000	8572000	Sure, sure.
8572000	8582000	And basically I've been calling him every flavor of a Dobo, including Green Hulk, a Dobo, because he's actually got the green version with the purple pants that looks like the Hulk.
8582000	8583000	So it's funny.
8583000	8584000	Yes, I remember.
8584000	8591000	And then the one I can't remember who I always refer to as a self-immolation man, because when you beat him, he blows himself up.
8591000	8592000	Right.
8592000	8600000	And then there's like these really annoying Kunoichi in the game. Just really annoying. But finally beat it.
8600000	8607000	All right. Well, I guess that is going to wrap it up for the Skype line tonight. But if you want to still get in touch with the show, you can always send us an email.
8607000	8611000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
8611000	8613000	So no last minute stories, Loki? Nothing else that came through?
8613000	8632000	Just a note about the latest patch for Overwatch, the PTR patch. Apparently there's an issue with Bastion right now that if you use the passive ability Ironclad, as well as, I guess, I guess in Sentry Tank mode, it reduces damage by 35%.
8632000	8640000	Then there's another bonus that's Ana's Nano Boost that does an additional 50% damage reduction, making him pretty much unkillable.
8640000	8641000	Oh, interesting.
8641000	8655000	I heard about the Bastion changes on PTR. They've been kind of trying to make Bastion a little more like something that because Bastion is kind of the character not a lot of people are playing, even though fucking I got play of the game with Bastion in a Mystery Heroes match.
8655000	8662000	Because again, it's so easy to just sit there and make a turret somewhere and then just pick everybody off if they don't know where you're at.
8662000	8676000	So yeah, Bastion still does have its usefulness, but I do kind of see where he's also like, if you make the smallest mistake and give away Bastion's location or whatever, he's so squishy and really easily defeatable.
8676000	8677000	Not anymore.
8677000	8688000	Yeah, not anymore. Although it is a test realm, so that could possibly change. And Nano Boost is also really situational. It doesn't last forever. Ana only is able to power you up for a few seconds.
8688000	8698000	So I mean, I actually am kind of okay with him being mostly invincible as part of Ana's ultimate, if that's what they want to do, but we'll see. We'll see.
8698000	8707000	Alright. Well, I guess that's gonna do it for another edition of Orange Lawn Radio. Thank you guys so much for tuning into the show tonight. We appreciate all the support.
8707000	8717000	If you like what you heard here at Orange Lawn Radio, please tell a friend or five about the show. Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but you know, only if the voice is out there to use them.
8717000	8732000	So we'll go around and give everybody's final thought for the night. My final thought for the night is I want to play more, I think I actually do want to play more Oblivion, but maybe I just want to get into Skyrim HD already.
8732000	8741000	Being surrounded by all the Elder Scrolls fandom is starting to finally rub off on me a little bit, I think. But then, of course, when Mass Effect comes out, it'll all be over because alien butts.
8741000	8743000	You still need to play well with me.
8743000	8746000	It's a monthly fee. You gonna pay my fee?
8746000	8748000	I might for a month, if you play with me.
8748000	8752000	We'll see, we'll see. I heard the cost of those, I heard the cost of those.
8752000	8754000	It went up to $80,000.
8754000	8766000	Because, do you know why that happened? Because Blizzard made it so that you can use those tokens to either buy a month of WoW or redeem $15 of Battle.net credit.
8766000	8772000	So people are now using them to buy the $15 in Battle.net credit to get loot boxes in Overwatch.
8773000	8776000	So that's driven the prices of them way up.
8776000	8777000	Fuckballs.
8777000	8781000	Yeah. Anyway. So, Dark Soccer, your final thought for the night?
8781000	8782000	Resist.
8782000	8784000	And Loki, your final thought tonight?
8784000	8791000	My final thought is when I was speaking with Gabriel earlier this week, he was telling me, you know, I was just explaining my situation at hideout time or anything.
8791000	8799000	He said to make the smallest game I could possibly make, so that's, I guess, what I'll do. Make the smallest game I could possibly finish.
8799000	8801000	Alright, so next week we're gonna play it?
8802000	8805000	I don't know. I already have an idea, so we'll go from there.
8805000	8808000	Here we go again. Another idea. Another one of Loki's ideas.
8808000	8812000	I have tons of ideas. I have lots of ideas and I write them all down.
8812000	8814000	Make it. Make it. Alright.
8814000	8818000	That is it. That's gonna do it for tonight's episode of Orange Launch Radio.
8818000	8824000	Thank you guys again for tuning in and listening. We will be back in seven days to do it all over again.
8824000	8830000	Until then, be nice to each other online and playing games and stuff. Don't be rude. Bye.
