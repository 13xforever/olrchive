00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,000
On the heels of celebration comes the inevitable hangover as we learn of a few cancellations, extensions of life, and a look back at what may have been. We hope you still have all your fingers, eyebrows, and all other appendages intact so they can join us right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It's Orange Lounge Radio live tonight on July 9th, 2017 with episode number 693 of our show.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:58,000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joined as I am every week over the last, you know, 692 episodes since it's 693 with my co-host. Say hello over there to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

5
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Oh hi.

6
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Hi, how are you doing?

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm okay.

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Did you have a good 4th of July holiday?

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I stayed inside so it was great.

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Yeah.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I had a bit of a headache and I didn't want to be around other humans.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Yeah.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So it was great.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I had a really terrible day but it got worse because somebody set off a firework at 3 in the morning and it sounded like they fired a gun. Like I seriously thought somebody got in our backyard to fire off a bottle rocket or something because it sounded like such a large explosion.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
That sucks.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And I just, oh my gosh, it was so terrible. But I mean, we were able to, Alan's birthday was Friday so we got to go to Benihana. So you know, things got better but oh my gosh, I was like a zombie at work on Wednesday. It was so unfair. So unfair.

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So I know it's a radio show so our listeners can't see your shirt but your shirt today says Slay All Day.

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Slay All Day.

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Where did you buy, where did you get that? Did you make that?

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Target.

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Target has a shirt that says Slay All Day?

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I also have a shirt that says Can't Adult Today.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Target sell that too?

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Yeah.

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Wow. I had no idea that they sold such hip things.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's like a sleeveless muscle shirt but this is what I wore to Pride. This whole outfit is what I wore to Pride.

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Nice.

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Including the boot.

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Including the boot which you are still rocking.

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's split on the toe.

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
How much longer are you in the boot for?

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Till the 25th.

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Okay, well I guess that's manageable.

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Which is right before California Extreme.

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Yes.

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm so happy.

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Which I am. I am still planning to do California Extreme but I'm planning myself a long week.

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Well I'm only going to go Saturday because I don't want to rush on Sunday because I'll be dead.

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Maybe all that we're doing is Saturday.

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm going to go to Rocky Horror in the City Saturday night and go visit my old pals on the cast over there that I used to perform with.

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So that's my plan. So I'm going to have a very busy day on that Saturday.

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
But California Extreme, I'm really excited about it.

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I haven't been in like seven or eight years.

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Really?

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Oh, it's been a long time.

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Well, GamerX was the same weekend a couple of years.

47
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
That was unfortunate.

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And then I don't remember what came up.

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It's just, you know, trips or something always kind of held me back.

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I want to rotate my foot.

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Alright.

52
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I want to make sure while you stretch your foot and do what you need to do, I want to introduce Techmaster Loki.

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Hello.

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
How are you doing, Loki?

55
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm fine.

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So the 4th of July, a holiday about fire.

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Surely one that you participated in?

58
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
No.

59
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
No?

60
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
No, the fireworks here suck so I'm not going to spend any money on them.

61
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I mean, literally you can spend like one firework that they have that lasts for maybe 30 seconds is like 20 bucks.

62
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
No thanks.

63
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
They just get worse every year.

64
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
And I just didn't want to waste some of my money on it.

65
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yeah, the fireworks are not that great.

66
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
But you know what else is really awful is fires.

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So I understand why they, well, especially when people are setting off the crazy stuff anyway.

68
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I understand.

69
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
They do it anyways.

70
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I don't think it would matter if they brought in the better fireworks because they bring in the better fireworks anyways.

71
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I know some people love their 4th of July.

72
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
RideMyChocoboMan in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, I love blowing shit up.

73
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Let's see, Bobby Black Wolf, our pal who's live before us at VOG Network on Sunday night says, I stayed home on July 4th and binge watched Doctor Who.

74
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I figured that was the best way to celebrate Brexit 1776.

75
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Yes, I know a lot of people were into the Doctor Who because the finale of this most recent season just happened, right?

76
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So I'm a little behind on a lot of my television stuff.

77
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
If it's not on Netflix, I'm not watching it right now.

78
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
So I'm a little behind on some of this stuff.

79
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I have to rely on the other VOG Network shows to keep me on that stuff.

80
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Anyway, we are of course here to talk about video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle with you guys in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

81
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
because we do tape live Sunday nights at 6 Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

82
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So if you are listening to us live, head on into our chat room.

83
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
But if you're listening to us on the podcast feed, hey, that's great too.

84
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You can always send us an email.

85
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Participate at orangeonshreddy.com or you can always tweet at us at OLR.

86
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You can probably send a carrier pigeon and it will probably find its way to us one way or another.

87
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
We invite you to participate in many different ways including the brand new Discord

88
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
which a lot of you guys have been showing up to which has been awesome.

89
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So if you haven't checked out the new VOG Network Discord, be sure to head over to vognetwork.com

90
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
and under the participate banner is Discord.

91
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And I believe that's just vognetwork.com slash Discord.

92
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And that will get you the invite you need to get in there.

93
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
And yeah, we've been using that and I already have people talking to me when they see me playing Final Fantasy XIV

94
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
asking if I want to party up and stuff like that so that's kind of fun.

95
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So yeah, check that out, our new Discord.

96
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Meanwhile, I want to get into some game chat for the night including our kickoff topic tonight.

97
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You know, it was a little bit slower of a news week with the 4th of July, a holiday happening in the middle of the week.

98
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You had a lot of people that made it a long weekend last weekend or kind of took a couple extra days off.

99
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So it kind of slowed the news cycle this week.

100
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
But next week is going to be a pretty big release, I think, for game releases

101
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
even though it is the re-release of a game that came out in 2006, I think.

102
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
So it's well over about 11 years old at this point.

103
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Final Fantasy XII, although this time they are releasing the Zodiac Age version of the game

104
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
which is similar to what they did when they did the Final Fantasy X remaster and the X-II remaster.

105
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:30,000
They did a, like the international versions of those games were what we got as the release on Playstation 4.

106
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:37,000
So they're doing something similar to Final Fantasy XII which is great because I remember when the Final Fantasy X stuff came out

107
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I think one of the things we all said was, wouldn't it be great if they did this for XII as well

108
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,000
because a lot of people kind of missed that game because that came out right as the Xbox 360 was taken off

109
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
and the PS3 was about to come out.

110
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
So Final Fantasy XII, I think a lot of people kind of overlooked.

111
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So it's great that that's coming out and people get to re-experience that again.

112
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So I want to actually talk a little bit here at the top of the show about remasters.

113
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And you know, I know Final Fantasy XII is the one that's coming out this week that we all have to look forward to.

114
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:13,000
But, you know, certainly we've talked a lot on previous episodes about the Switch

115
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
and the remasters from the Wii U that we're seeing coming out on Switch

116
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
especially like Mario Kart 8 which has done very, very well for them.

117
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
We saw this week there were teasers. We don't know what to make of it.

118
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
But, you know, it's kind of like people are looking into these tweets and going,

119
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
oh well they said 2 and 1 and 2 plus 1 is 3 so Half-Life 3 confirmed.

120
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,000
But there was a tweet from, was it Kamiya that tweeted out or was it Platinum Games account?

121
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Who tweeted?

122
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I think it was the Platinum Games account.

123
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I think it was the Platinum Games account.

124
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Tweeted a picture of the Wonderful 101 and if you look over somebody's shoulder they're playing it on the Switch.

125
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:56,000
And then there was like a Bayonetta graphic that had the Bayonetta from her look in Bayonetta 1 and Bayonetta from her look in 2.

126
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And it was like red and blue and they were kind of like on top of each other sort of like it could be a Switch.

127
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Like they were Switched. Get it?

128
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Okay, Half-Life 3 confirmed a little bit here.

129
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,000
But it has people talking all about those games potentially getting Switch remasters.

130
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
So I'm curious what you all think about, you can talk about these remasters if you want.

131
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
But remasters in general and I open this up to our chatters as well.

132
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I don't consider those remasters, I consider them porting them to another system because they're not doing anything to them.

133
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
They're just re-releasing them on another system.

134
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Second chances.

135
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It's not even, yeah, I mean it's like that's not a remaster.

136
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
A remaster would be something like, okay, this game came out on another system.

137
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Like the Halo collection or something like that where they completely redo all the graphics and the meshes and everything like that.

138
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Crash Bandicoot.

139
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Crash Bandicoot. Which is apparently doing really well.

140
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Especially in the UK.

141
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Which doesn't, I mean that franchise was always I think particularly larger over there on that side of the pond than it was.

142
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I mean it was still kind of big over here but it was really big in the UK if I remember right.

143
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So it's doing phenomenal over there from what I understand.

144
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
So even to the point where, and I hope I'm not spoiling a story.

145
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I don't think it was one I showrolled but it was one that I was looking at.

146
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:16,000
That they've even kind of commented that like they're looking at maybe doing something with Crash Bandicoot in the future because this remaster is doing so well.

147
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
But it is truly a remaster and I realize we're kind of splitting Harris a little bit because you're right.

148
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
If you look at, let's say Bayonetta gets released on the Switch.

149
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Is that really a remaster or is that a port?

150
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It's a second chance is what it is.

151
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Those games are a second chance.

152
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You know it's a port running at like 1080p or something like that when...

153
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Yeah, yeah. The PC one, like I bought Bayonetta on PC.

154
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's not really a remaster but it runs better than it does on the original Playstation 3 and so forth.

155
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
So, ok it's not a remaster but it's still a modernized version if you will.

156
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And I would assume that even if they do end up doing the Bayonetta 1 and 2 thing on the Switch.

157
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
They'll probably throw something extra in there to sweeten the pot just because there are going to be...

158
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Amiibo support, always fucking Amiibo support.

159
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Oh yeah, good call, Amiibo support.

160
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
She'll wear a hat, it'll be like a Mario hat or suspenders or something.

161
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
That's a great idea.

162
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It's a terrible fucking idea.

163
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,000
She'll wear a peach crown or she'll have the little Rosalina Luna following her or...

164
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It'll be something stupid like that and everyone's like,

165
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It's got Amiibo support, gotta buy it now.

166
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Like fucking Skyrim on the Switch because it has support for Amiibos.

167
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Alright, let's get to some comments and chat and then you guys can follow up to this.

168
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
JD in chat says,

169
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
And Dungeon Buster immediately follows that up with,

170
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,000
And I think that's why a lot of these games are getting their second chance life on the Switch for what it is.

171
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Bobby Blackwolf says,

172
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Yeah, I am and I'm not with you.

173
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Like I kind of like the Journey thing.

174
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I liked when they re-released Journey but I understand how not every game necessarily needs to see a second version.

175
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
But it is interesting because since the PlayStation 4 isn't fully backwards compatible with PlayStation 3,

176
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I'm not going to count the PlayStation Now stuff because that's a subscription thing.

177
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You know, some of these big games that maybe people who didn't buy a PS3 may be tempted with on a PS4.

178
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
But I do have to admit, to Bobby's credit on that comment,

179
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I do have to admit, when I saw that Shadow of the Colossus trailer at E3 this year, I was kind of like,

180
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Okay, cool.

181
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I mean, I know a lot of people really like that game but this Shadow of the Colossus is a game that's getting a second remaster.

182
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
And I was like, that's interesting.

183
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Well, this is more of a remake at this point.

184
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Well, but look at Final Fantasy 4.

185
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Final Fantasy 4 was on the Super Nintendo.

186
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,000
There was a great, great version on the PSP I bet many people never played because it was on the PSP

187
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
and I don't think they ever put it on anything else.

188
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You might have been able to download it on the Vita.

189
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I think that you download it on the Vita because back when Sony did backwards compatibility,

190
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
you could play the PSP thing on the Vita.

191
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Yeah, you still can do that now.

192
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
That whole thing.

193
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
And yeah, I'm Shane in the PS4.

194
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,000
So they did that remaster but then there was also the 3D version that they did with the 3DS

195
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
which ended up being the version that they've also released on Steam.

196
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
And iOS.

197
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
And I think mobile devices, yeah, yeah.

198
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:00,000
So to be fair, Final Fantasy 4 has also been remastered twice and I've bought them all.

199
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Have they remastered 6?

200
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
So I guess I can't shade Shadow of the Colossus too bad.

201
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Did they remaster 6? I know they did 4.

202
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Okay, they did do a remaster of 6 but it was the mobile version.

203
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
And I think they outsourced the graphics or something.

204
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Like it just seems kind of...

205
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:26,000
It doesn't seem like it's gotten the same TLC that the DS remasters got.

206
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Like it just seems like let's update the sprites and throw it out there.

207
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
And it kind of feels a little cheap to me.

208
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
And Final Fantasy 6 is not a game that deserves to be treated cheaply.

209
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
But that was my opinion on those.

210
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I would love to see a remaster done like the Final Fantasy 7 remaster for 6.

211
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
For real, right?

212
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
It would be awesome.

213
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
When is this Final Fantasy 7 remaster going to come out?

214
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'll never. PlayStation 5 at this point.

215
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Okay, now we're really getting into semantics now.

216
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Final Fantasy 7 really isn't a remaster, it's a remake.

217
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And I'm only nitpicking on that one because it is very obvious.

218
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
The Final Fantasy 7 remake is a completely new game.

219
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
But based off the shooting script.

220
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
It's like doing a movie based off the shooting script of the original movie.

221
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You know what I mean?

222
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
They did Little Orphan Annie in the 80s.

223
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000
And then they did that new Little Orphan Annie with Jamie Foxx and Cameron Diaz.

224
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
They do this in Hollywood all the time.

225
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
They take the old movie and then they modernize it.

226
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
And most of the time, it's not good.

227
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
But sometimes, it's pretty good.

228
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I'm trying to think off the top of my head.

229
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
What were some Hollywood ones that were alright?

230
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
That they modernized and they came out okay?

231
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I'm drawing a blank right now because I don't talk about movies as much as I talk about games.

232
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Well, I mean, some people don't like this.

233
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
War of the Worlds I thought was pretty good.

234
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
But that's more of a redo based off I think the movie.

235
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
It wasn't necessarily...

236
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Okay, but actually that's an excellent example.

237
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Because War of the Worlds being that it was a huge radio thing, right?

238
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Then technology got newer, so they did a movie based off it.

239
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:13,000
In a weird way, it's kind of like the technology for 7 was a lot older in the PS1 days.

240
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
And now they're using the technology for the PlayStation 4 version.

241
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Yeah, because 7, man, now if you try...

242
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It does not. It did not age well.

243
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Let's see.

244
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Vidpower in chat says,

245
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I guess the definition of remaster is kind of blurry nowadays.

246
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Yeah, it is. It really is.

247
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says,

248
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Well, wouldn't any movie based on a Shakespeare play be a remaster and a modernizing?

249
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I guess in a way.

250
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
In a way, but I mean, they carry their own controversies now, don't they?

251
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Remember when Baz Luhrmann did Romeo and Juliet?

252
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I love that. It was fantastic.

253
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I love that movie too.

254
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I think it's something about how old you were when that movie came out.

255
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Like if you were a teen around the time that movie came out, like you loved it.

256
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
And then like other people hated it.

257
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Because I know people that just straight up hate that Romeo and Juliet reinterpretation.

258
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
But I loved it.

259
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
But I mean, in a way, yeah, Bobby.

260
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I mean, I don't know if you're being sarcastic or not, but I kind of...

261
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I kind of think, you know, when they redo those Shakespeare plays as movies,

262
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
sometimes they do it traditionally.

263
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Like I think there was a Hamlet one a few years ago.

264
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
And sometimes they do it very non-traditionally.

265
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
And you know that you have that.

266
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
So, let's see.

267
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

268
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,000
JD says, I'm a lot less tolerant of movie remakes than for video games for some reason.

269
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
E3VL in chat says, Jumanji is going to be horrible.

270
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Oh, God.

271
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Do you know, I literally forgot that was happening.

272
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I forgot that was happening.

273
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I tried to. Thanks for reminding me.

274
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Thanks for reminding us, E3VL.

275
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Now, go sit in the corner and think about what you've done.

276
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I'm just kidding.

277
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Jumanji was pretty good, but like, I get it that they're modernizing it.

278
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
And then there's all this stupid fan wink that they're saying,

279
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
well, the game just adapted itself to be more appealing.

280
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Fucking no, it's not.

281
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It's just trying to be...

282
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Jumanji like was...

283
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
The first movie was based off of the book a little bit closer

284
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
because it was basically this game comes alive.

285
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
It starts bringing all this like dangerous jungle shit into the real world.

286
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
And they have to deal with it.

287
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Granted, the kids' book kind of glosses over most of that stuff,

288
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
but I mean, that's basically it.

289
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I remember the book was the thing that the teacher would read to the whole class.

290
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Did y'all do this in school where the teacher would sit in front of the class

291
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
and read the book?

292
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
And then this happened, turn the page.

293
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
And like, yeah, I remember Jumanji was like that book.

294
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Yeah, and the Jumanji, you know, the first movie was pretty good with Robin Williams.

295
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
And you know, it kind of like amped up how dangerous everything was.

296
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
This one is some fucking bullshit.

297
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,000
It's an Atari 2600 or 8-bit retro game that's called Jumanji.

298
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
And the kids get sucked into the game and they play their characters in the game.

299
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
And it's so hilarious because the hot chick becomes this nerdy guy

300
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
and like all this funny stuff because they're breaking their molds

301
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
and they're going to learn something about themselves.

302
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
And fuck this movie in its fucking ass because it looks terrible.

303
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Slow your roll.

304
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Why the fuck did The Rock sign this?

305
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,000
This is about as bad as when Brendan Fraser signed up for the fucking Journey to the Center of the Earth.

306
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Money, money, money, money, money. It's all about money.

307
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
All right, let me ask you this. Calm down for a minute.

308
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Go to a happy place.

309
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I know this isn't totally games, but humor me for a minute here.

310
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
It's a slow news week.

311
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Loki, let's say you are the next big Hollywood producer.

312
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
What movie would you remake and what would you do to it?

313
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Would I remake?

314
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Yeah.

315
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I'd do a live action Macross franchise.

316
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Oh, but you saw what happened with Ghost in the Shell.

317
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I wouldn't be fucking stupid like that, okay?

318
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I didn't have some fucking respect for the goddamn material.

319
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Hire actors that are the nationality of the characters, okay?

320
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
We don't need a fucking Scarlett Johansson in the movie.

321
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Just fucking make it good.

322
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Why is that so hard?

323
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Make it good.

324
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Dark Soccer, I got to poke you with the same question.

325
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
And then I'm going to ask about games, Loki, so be thinking of that.

326
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Dark Soccer, what would you remaster if you could go to Hollywood and any movie you could remake?

327
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
What would you do?

328
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I wouldn't.

329
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I'd do a new fucking franchise.

330
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
You refuse.

331
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
There's no movie worthy of modernization.

332
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I'd make an actual Mass Effect movie.

333
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
That's what would happen.

334
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Supposedly they were working on one.

335
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Well, they're wrong.

336
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I hope this shit with Andromeda does not push that movie off track.

337
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I really don't.

338
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I don't know, I would actually do an HD remaster of the first Dragon Age.

339
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I'll tell you what, I'd go back and remaster and not remaster and make a fucking other sequel.

340
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
A new Tron movie.

341
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Because fucking hell, we need a new Tron movie.

342
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
There you go, there you go.

343
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Fucking remastered shit.

344
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
What are they talking about?

345
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Like remastering with Jared Leto?

346
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Fuck that.

347
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It's such a terrible, stupid...

348
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Hey, let's take this great franchise and fucking shove it into the ground, okay?

349
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
That's gonna be fantastic.

350
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Okay, so what about games?

351
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
What game do you think needs to be...

352
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
And I posted this to the chat as well, you guys, over at live.vognora.com.

353
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
What game...

354
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
And you can go as far back as you want.

355
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:34,000
What game needs to be remastered, modernized for PlayStation 4, Switch, wherever you want to put it.

356
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Xbox One, PC.

357
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Well, I mean, the easy option, and I hope it's actually something that's gonna happen,

358
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
because I know they did a poll for it, would be R4.

359
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I would like to see...

360
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I want a new Ridge Racer.

361
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I know that the last game that they did was like a fun fucking money grab shit.

362
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
And that didn't sell well for them, so good.

363
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
It shouldn't, because it was crap.

364
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
But like make...

365
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
R4 is probably the best Ridge Racer game that they put out.

366
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Remaster that.

367
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Make it look good.

368
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
You can add tracks from the other games.

369
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I don't give a shit.

370
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Just make another good Ridge Racer game.

371
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I'm gonna tell you what game I'm thinking of when I'm asking this question,

372
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
and I think they're doing a phenomenal job with it, is Blaster Master Zero.

373
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
And you know I love that original Blaster Master game, and I like the new one a lot,

374
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
but what I'm really liking about it is the continued value of the game.

375
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
And we'll talk...

376
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I know we have a story coming up on it later, but the DLC in that game is pretty outstanding.

377
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
We can get a Fester's Quest Zero, how about that?

378
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I think Fester's Quest was kind of underrated personally,

379
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
because it was just the overhead shots from Blaster Master as a game,

380
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
but yeah, hell yeah, why not Fester's Quest re-updated?

381
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Have like Fester in there as a special character.

382
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Why not?

383
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Oh my god, get Fester in the DLC for Blaster Master.

384
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Like surely there's no licensing issues there.

385
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Dar Sakura, what about you?

386
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I'd already said Dragon Age.

387
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Oh yeah, sorry, you said Dragon Age right at the tail end.

388
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
But what about like, um...

389
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Oh, like Zombies Ate My Neighbors, or...

390
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Yeah, I've always thought about that.

391
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
That's a good pick.

392
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
That's a good pick.

393
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I am surprised you did not immediately say what I would be saying.

394
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
The Guardian Legend.

395
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
The Guardian Legend, yes, thank you very much.

396
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
TGL.

397
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Thank you.

398
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
They've already redone Fantasy Zone with the Sega Ages collections.

399
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Oh, true.

400
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:28,000
It had like the Sega 2800 or whatever it was.

401
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
The cheaper packages that were the 3D remakes.

402
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
So both that and Space Harrier have already been done,

403
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
so the Guardian Legend would have to happen.

404
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
And not just Gardic, we want Gardic Gaiden.

405
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
All right, let me go to chat over at live.familynetwork.com.

406
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Some great answers to chat.

407
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Bobby Blackwolf suggests Katamari Damacy.

408
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
That game's due for another chance.

409
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
They did a remaster of that not too long ago.

410
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
That was the one they did for like Xbox.

411
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I mean, the later games, they just kind of said,

412
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
eh, we don't know how to make any new levels,

413
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
we're just going to bring those levels back.

414
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
It was the PlayStation 3 version, was like a best of...

415
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
No, it was the Vita.

416
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Vita was the last proper release for that game, I think.

417
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Yeah.

418
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I think it's...

419
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Enough time has passed.

420
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Yeah, clicker games don't fucking count.

421
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Um, let's see.

422
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Especially now with like all the processors being able to handle

423
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
all these different objects and everything,

424
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I would think it'd be pretty awesome to see what Katamari game.

425
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
J.D. says, Mother 3.

426
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Well, you have to release it first before you remaster it.

427
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
You have to release it first, Tiger.

428
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Oh, that was something that they were going off on the entire time

429
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
of several of the runs at Summer Games and Quick.

430
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Yeah.

431
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
As they should.

432
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I mean, for serious.

433
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
For serious.

434
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
He fucking...

435
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
They know that they want it released.

436
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Why aren't they doing it?

437
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Because they're being assholes.

438
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
SSG100Matt says,

439
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
OLR is due to get in trouble over a Katamari game again.

440
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Oh, shut up.

441
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Let's see.

442
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Tigerclaw says,

443
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I know one game that needs a remaster or remake,

444
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
and this one is very dear to you.

445
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Super Metroid.

446
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Why?

447
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Because Nintendo is remaking Metroid 2, so why not?

448
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Let me tell you why I don't want them to remake Super Metroid.

449
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
It was good the way it was.

450
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Because you can't improve perfection.

451
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
You can't improve perfection.

452
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
All that laugh aside,

453
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
because I know that will get a reaction out of Bobby,

454
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
all that talk aside,

455
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I would say, honestly,

456
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I would just encourage them to do a new 2D adventure.

457
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
They don't have to be remakes.

458
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I would go for a Metroid maker.

459
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
That would be kind of awesome, actually.

460
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I like this answer from Dungeon Buster.

461
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Fantasy Star, the first one as a Western release.

462
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
You know, a lot of the look and feel of Fantasy Star

463
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
really changed with Fantasy Star Online and stuff.

464
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
It would be very interesting to see the story of the original Fantasy Star

465
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
kind of in that environment.

466
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
But I would also just happily take, you know, PSO2 being released.

467
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Black Wolf says,

468
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Remaster Maniac Mansion.

469
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I thought they did recently, didn't they?

470
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
They did.

471
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Oh, no, they did Remaster Day of the Tentacle.

472
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I thought they did Maniac Mansion too, but maybe not.

473
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I don't think they did the remasters of all the...

474
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Yeah, no, I think they only did Day of the Tentacle.

475
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
They never got around to doing Maniac Mansion.

476
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
They did all of the...

477
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
What's their prior game?

478
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I played a ton of them.

479
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Why can't I think of this?

480
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
It's bothering me, I can see.

481
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I don't think about it.

482
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
But, yeah, they did...

483
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
They've done a lot of remasters in the past for their games.

484
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I mean, I don't see why not.

485
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Let's see.

486
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I'm trying to look at a couple other comments from chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

487
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Let's see.

488
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
That's why I was thinking of Monkey Island.

489
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
There we go.

490
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Tigerclaw says, you can improve perfection with better graphics, better gameplay.

491
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
But that's...

492
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
The gameplay's perfect, though.

493
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
And sometimes, I'm sure we'd love to see in a marathon someday.

494
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I suppose you could give it the treatment that StarCraft is getting.

495
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
With, you know, they're not really changing the game.

496
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
They're only changing the graphics and the way the internet part of it works.

497
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Just have the team that does all the fucking cel-shaded shit for the Rayman series,

498
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
remaster that game, and leave everything else the same.

499
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Just remaster the graphics.

500
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Alright.

501
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I guess I could go with that, for sure.

502
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Bump up the lighting and make it all cool-looking.

503
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Turn up the graphics on level 3?

504
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Absolutely.

505
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Alright.

506
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Well, we'll see what the game industry has in store for remasters and remakes in the future.

507
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
But for now, we're going to move on with our show.

508
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
We're going to talk a little bit about our gaming weeks.

509
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I'll go to Dark Soccer in just a moment here.

510
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
But first, some quick plugs.

511
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Again, I do want to just mention, of course, our Facebook.

512
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

513
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
And we're also on Twitter as well.

514
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

515
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I already plugged the Discord, although I was going to do it here.

516
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
So, I'll plug it again.

517
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
The new Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

518
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,000
And we should be here every show for the next few weeks.

519
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I will mention this.

520
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:58,000
There will be no show over Labor Day weekend because, as usual, has been the case for the past few years.

521
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I will be at Dragon Con in Atlanta that weekend along with Bobby Blackwolf and hopefully some other folks from VOG as well.

522
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Very fortunate this year to be recognized as a professional at Dragon Con.

523
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Very thankful to the podcasting track and buddies over there who really encouraged me to go for that designation.

524
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
And, yeah, it worked out this year.

525
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,000
So, I'm really, really looking forward to participating even more with Dragon Con as a show this year.

526
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
So, it's going to be a fun, fun year at Dragon Con.

527
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Really looking forward to it.

528
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
But we won't be here Labor Day weekend as a result.

529
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Most of you are traveling anyway.

530
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
But we hope, if it's reasonable for you, you'll be traveling over to Dragon Con.

531
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Anyway, let's get into our gaming weeks and the types of video games we've been playing this week.

532
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

533
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I have been playing Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2.

534
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:50,000
I actually didn't play any WoW this week, I don't think.

535
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I've been playing my cell phone games and Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2. That's it.

536
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball.

537
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I'm kind of rediscovering the love. It's been pretty fun.

538
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Yeah, there's nothing wrong with that.

539
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:11,000
And I think I've watched now every episode of Dragon Ball Z again, just fast forwarding past the fillers, like in the last week.

540
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:18,000
And I have to say this up front because I did poll everybody in the room before we did the show tonight.

541
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
But none of us did get around to watching that Castlevania anime, so we can't really talk about it tonight.

542
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Do you plan to at some point, DarkSakura, watch it?

543
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Yeah, probably this week.

544
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Yeah. I'm okay with it only being four episodes because that makes it a lot easier to kind of consume, if you know what I mean.

545
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I can kind of treat it a little more like a movie.

546
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
But I'm hearing really good things about it.

547
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Yeah, it looks good.

548
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Yeah, so I'm excited about that.

549
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?

550
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
I didn't play a whole ton this week.

551
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I did end up playing a little bit of Playstation VR yesterday because we had some friends over and I was showing them that.

552
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:57,000
And then I decided to get into the game, so I did play a little bit of Until Dawn Rush of Blood, which I still love that game.

553
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:05,000
It would be fun to speedrun that, but I don't think you can because it's on rails and there's minimal things you can speed up in that.

554
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I mainly just played mobile games, so still playing the Office Space one.

555
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I played very little of Pokemon Go.

556
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I know they have different things going on, but I don't know.

557
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
It's not up to really kind of get me playing the game a lot.

558
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Although, I keep running into inventory problems now.

559
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I've accumulated so many Pokeballs that I'm like, geez, I've got to start catching things because I have like 175 Pokeballs.

560
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I've got to start throwing them away just to be able to keep getting my daily spins on stuff.

561
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
So, I don't know.

562
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
That's pretty much it.

563
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I've been trying to work on the Game Jam stuff.

564
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I've been falling asleep while working on the Game Jam stuff, so not much has been getting accomplished there.

565
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,000
But I'm trying. No promises. That's it.

566
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Okay. I have to admit, I haven't really been playing a lot this week.

567
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,000
On a personal note, my mom went back in the hospital on the 4th of July.

568
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
That's the thing that happened that kind of ruined the holiday.

569
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,000
And she's been asleep since then after having a couple surgeries.

570
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:25,000
The doctors say she's going to be fine and she's on a path to getting better.

571
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
But obviously, it takes an emotional toll. I'm sure you all can understand.

572
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
So anyway, not to be too much of a downer, but that's the reality.

573
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Why I haven't been streaming a lot this week and why I haven't been playing a lot this week.

574
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Real life happens sometimes.

575
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:45,000
But when I have been playing games, I've been playing a bit of Pokemon Go with Alan.

576
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Just because Alan's kind of into it, I'm into it.

577
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
The new rating thing is actually really rad.

578
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I'm liking it more and more because we actually do it.

579
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
It's not impossible for Alan and I to go take out a gym together.

580
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Our little strategy that we do now, we go out at like 11 o'clock, 11.30 and take gyms.

581
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
So that way they stay up overnight and we get our 50 coins.

582
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,000
We don't take a lot. We'll take like 2 or 3 to make sure one of them stays up overnight and we get our 50 coins.

583
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
And that's kind of like what we do now.

584
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:23,000
So that's like a fun thing to do and still catching what we can and all that stuff.

585
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:31,000
But I would say if I have been gaming, it's been like all Final Fantasy XIV and the Stormblood expansion which I'm still making my way through.

586
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:38,000
And apparently I only have like 2 or 3 quests left before I'm done with the expansion.

587
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:47,000
And the story has definitely been ramping up and it's like everything is leading up to the big final conflict and Final Fantasy style.

588
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
So excited to finally finish that.

589
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:56,000
And I got to say, I think I preferred the Heavensward story better.

590
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
But Stormblood is great. Don't get me wrong. Stormblood is great.

591
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:04,000
But I think there's some great characters in Stormblood that are really, really like...

592
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
You're really interested in a lot of these characters.

593
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
And the bad people are like really, really bad and well done bad.

594
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
And the good people are also really, really well done.

595
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:20,000
So I think you can almost get into the characters in a way that I only felt a big connection with just a couple in Heavensward.

596
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Even though I felt the story was better in Heavensward.

597
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
So yeah, been playing a lot of Final Fantasy XIV.

598
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
But other than that, that's pretty much my gaming.

599
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
But I am looking forward to Final Fantasy XII next week.

600
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I will definitely be picking that up on Tuesday.

601
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Now, I saw just briefly something. I don't think it's in our show role.

602
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,000
It was someone was complaining about how there's a housing shortage in Final Fantasy XIV.

603
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Oh yeah. So on one of the servers, some guys bought up like all the houses in one of the wards.

604
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,000
So there's like a limited number of player housing that you can have on the servers in Final Fantasy XIV.

605
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I guess it boils down to storage space.

606
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,000
So on one of the servers, which isn't even the one I play on. It's one of the lesser populated servers.

607
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Somebody bought all the housing on there.

608
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
And I don't remember what the point was they were trying to make.

609
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
But there was some point they were trying to make with it.

610
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,000
And it's just, it's interesting because the space for housing is limited in that game.

611
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:23,000
And I've already seen it cause things where people buy plots and then flip them, try to sell them for twice as much.

612
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Like scalping, basically virtual scalping of these limited plots.

613
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
And I understand there's like storage and server issues.

614
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,000
But I really wish the team would find a way to really like dramatically increase the size of the housing.

615
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Though to their credit, I mean they have expanded it several times.

616
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Like they are trying to address it and expanding it in different ways that they do.

617
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Why can't they just let them only own one house?

618
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Well because what they're doing is they're rolling new characters, sending the money to the other characters and then buying them on the other characters.

619
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
So even if they are limited to just one, they're just not allowed to send money.

620
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
It should be one per account. It should be limited.

621
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
And I know there should be other stuff in place.

622
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Well the interesting thing about that is that it will probably get back to the development team on Final Fantasy XIV with all the press coverage that's been getting.

623
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
And they'll do something to address it.

624
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,000
But they have, so right now in the game there's three housing areas.

625
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:24,000
And they're about to open a fourth because of this expansion there's now a new housing area for Kugane.

626
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Which is the new big city that is going to have a whole ton of new plots to go with it.

627
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
So I assume that will help address the issue.

628
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,000
And they also at one point did what's called apartments which don't have a limit on them.

629
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:46,000
You can have a personal apartment for a set amount of money and as many players as wants to can have those.

630
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
So they're trying to address it in weird ways.

631
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:55,000
But sometimes the way they design things in that game kind of boxes them in.

632
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
And I feel like a ton of it dates back to 1.0.

633
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,000
And I realize there was no player housing in 1.0 but it's something about those servers and all that stuff.

634
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I feel like they got boxed in somehow and they still are trying to.

635
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,000
I mean the whole class and job system they're still boxed in from 1.0.

636
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:19,000
And every expansion so far they've done something to kind of further separate themselves from that.

637
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
They eliminated cross classing in this recent expansion.

638
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
They just eliminated the cross classing.

639
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,000
You no longer have to level Thaumaturge which is just Black Mage.

640
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Thaumaturge and Archer in order to get Black Mage.

641
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
You don't have to do that anymore.

642
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:42,000
So they did something new instead called role actions where you have a pool of 10 actions and you can pick 5 of them for your class.

643
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,000
And it's very similar to the cross classing but you don't actually have to level anything besides the class you want to play.

644
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
So it's kind of interesting in that way.

645
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:56,000
So let's see. Vidpower in chat says, what does housing do for players in Final Fantasy XIV?

646
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Not a lot. Most of it is visual. However, there's the airship stuff that you can send out on the exploratory voyages.

647
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
And I think you can only do that with a house.

648
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
You might be able to do it with apartments though. I don't remember.

649
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
See my free company has a house so I don't have to worry about any of this stuff.

650
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I think it makes sense you could probably do it from apartments too.

651
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Because it would seem weird that they would lock people out of that completely.

652
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
That's been my game of the week. Lots of Final Fantasy XIV.

653
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Although Stormblood's been great and it's been many hours.

654
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Now that all the launch issues are fixed, Stormblood's great.

655
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:46,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio with VoGnetwork.com, use the passphrase, earthquake.

656
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Okay, let's get into some gaming news, shall we? Lots of other stuff going on around the gaming community this week.

657
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
We'll start off with Loki.

658
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Yeah, so this is kind of neat.

659
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I guess I understand why they may have held off on it, but now they're allowing you on the Xbox Live game store.

660
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:16,000
You can actually purchase, or you're going to be able to make purchases soon and actually gift those digital purchases to friends.

661
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
So right now I know one that pretty much Steam does it.

662
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I don't think PlayStation Network or even Nintendo's or even Microsoft's currently allows it.

663
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,000
But it is going to be something that's going to be added pretty soon here.

664
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Which is good. I'm glad that they're going to have more options available if you want to gift someone something for their birthday or whatever.

665
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:51,000
The other thing that they're talking about adding that's not really confirmed yet is deleting achievement-less games.

666
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:57,000
But they haven't really added that. It was on the 360, but they never added it to the Xbox One.

667
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
So that's kind of nice.

668
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I wish I could do that with my library on the PlayStation Network where I could delete games I don't want on there.

669
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I have demos for shit, like a demo for Black Ops or something like that.

670
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I thought the trophy list stuff was on play. Oh, you mean you want it out of your library?

671
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Out of my library. I don't want it to display more. I don't need to have a demo for Lego Batman 3 anymore.

672
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Or the Destiny Alpha.

673
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
I don't need that in there.

674
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Yeah, a bunch of that stuff. I wish I could just say, please leave my library or something like that.

675
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Or don't display it anymore.

676
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Or move to bottom or something.

677
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Yeah, remove from the active list.

678
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Or separate it to a demo thing that only appears in demos or something like that.

679
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I wish I could do that.

680
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Well, the gifting thing, it's one of those things where it's kind of weird that it's not already there.

681
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:54,000
It's probably a good thing, though, because remember with all the problems that they had with the whole digital people stealing accounts and stuff like that.

682
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

683
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Maybe it's a good thing that that's not a thing right now.

684
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Didn't exist then, yeah.

685
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:08,000
But even still, people were still buying really expensive loot packs, which I think that's maybe even worse because they can buy multiples of those.

686
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:15,000
But I don't know. It is something, though, that I think is a feature that they should have.

687
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Yeah, I mean, I think we've all gifted each other stuff on Steam before.

688
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
You just bought me genital jousting for my birthday.

689
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Nothing says happy birthday like genital jousting, that's for sure.

690
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:37,000
But yeah, it would just make sense that you could have a wish list on Microsoft, Xbox.

691
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Well, also, I mean, since it is becoming one ecosystem with the PC, I mean, in a way, you could gift like Forza Horizon 3 and that would be on your Xbox and PC, right?

692
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:58,000
For those, I mean, I think it's still limited what games do that, but that's still a cool option that you can gift it to somebody and they get it on both.

693
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:05,000
So I'm kind of surprised now a feature like that doesn't exist on PlayStation or Switch even.

694
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Well, PlayStation I'm not too surprised with because there's a lot of features that people want that they're just not going to put out because the system's just not capable of doing that, you know, like emulating a PSP or PlayStation 1.

695
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Those advanced PlayStation 1 graphics, you know, the PSP could do the PlayStation 1, but you see, the PlayStation 4 just can't do the PlayStation 1.

696
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
So therefore, the PSP is definitely the more overpowered system.

697
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Right.

698
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Just bet you didn't know that, you know.

699
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
There's so much power in that thing you never realized.

700
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Exactly.

701
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:41,000
It would be great if they would just release a little UMD reader that you could hook up to via USB to the PlayStation 4, but I just somehow don't think that's going to happen.

702
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
It's just not on their list.

703
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
We don't need to go with UMDs. That was kind of dumb, but.

704
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,000
I still, do you know I still see UMDs for sale at like Fry's and stuff, but I think I was at Dimple the other day.

705
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:59,000
That was going to be the next big thing, remember? They were going to have all these movies and stuff that you could play on your PSP and it was a neat idea.

706
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
And then they came up with Blu-ray, so.

707
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
And then they released the Vita, and then they're like, what's a Vita?

708
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
And then that was that.

709
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Alright. Moving on, let's talk about Overwatch a little bit.

710
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,000
I did play a little Overwatch on the Public Test Realm, and it was because of this.

711
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Doomfist finally making his way into Overwatch. They've been teasing Doomfist ever since the very original trailer for the game.

712
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Because the two kids, if you remember the very first, like it looked like a fucking Pixar short.

713
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:37,000
The trailer for the game, the two kids are looking at, oh Doomfist, little fist of Doom or whatever it was, his actual Doomfist.

714
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:43,000
They were actually looking at that, so now Doomfist is a character that's in the game, so that's really awesome.

715
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,000
And he has some moves where, and I was, I actually tried playing with him a little bit.

716
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:52,000
So he can kind of shoot rockets out of his glove, but it's not super effective.

717
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
What he's really effective at doing is like charging at people, is kind of what he does.

718
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,000
And he can kind of do like a Shoryuken type of move, where he like uppercuts them into the air.

719
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,000
So it is really satisfactory to like rush somebody on the back line, like Ana or something, and then uppercut her.

720
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
So he's just Falcon punching everybody?

721
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Yeah, actually, yeah. So, I mean, Doomfist is, he also can actually punch a, actually the Captain Falcon comparison is not completely like, wrong.

722
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
And there's something really rewarding about all of that.

723
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:33,000
So like, I would play, like, I don't think Doomfist will be a main for me in Overwatch, but I won't be, like, when I get Tracer or Reaper in Random Heroes, I sigh.

724
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Because I'm terrible with those two characters, especially Tracer.

725
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Like, I love Tracer as a character, but trying to play her, I can't do it. I'm terrible with her.

726
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,000
So, but Doomfist, I would be happy to get. Like, Doomfist was a lot of fun to play.

727
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,000
But of course, on the test room right now, everybody's fucking playing Doomfist. Everybody's playing Doomfist.

728
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
But, I mean, that's to be expected. Of course, that's what's to be expected.

729
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Now, here's the other thing about Doomfist that I suppose is a little bit controversial, but I think it's very silly.

730
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:08,000
So Terry Crews is not going to be voicing Doomfist.

731
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:15,000
And, you know, there was, like, I think Terry Crews had tweeted something about that he wanted to be Doomfist.

732
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:20,000
So a lot of, like, the Blizzard fan community started, like, going crazy, like,

733
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Yeah, Terry Crews should do it. Terry Crews is awesome. He's a gamer like us.

734
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Well, they didn't go with Terry Crews. They went with an actor, and I'm so sorry if I mispronounce this.

735
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I think it's Seher Ngaouja. I think it's how you pronounce that. Sorry if I mispronounced that.

736
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:42,000
That is the voice actor that they went with. But when I see tweets about the voice actor they did go with,

737
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:47,000
I'm seeing all these responses that are like, Blizzard sucks. They should have went with Terry Crews.

738
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Like, it should have been Terry Crews. And I can't help but think, like, that's really fucking disrespectful to the voice actor that did get it.

739
00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:01,000
A, Doomfist's voice is fine. Like, he sounds fine in the game. In fact, he's better than fine. He's good.

740
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:08,000
He's a good voice actor and a good character. And, you know, I think Terry Crews is fucking awesome too, don't get me wrong.

741
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,000
But, he is a little- He doesn't need to voice everything. He doesn't need to voice everything.

742
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:18,000
And he does have a certain, like, I would say, like, it's kind of like a, like, loud over the top.

743
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Maybe this is Crackdown 3 influencing that a little bit. And that's the point I'm about to get to, is that-

744
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:28,000
I think it's Old Spice. He's still gonna get a nice fucking paycheck from Crackdown 3.

745
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Terry Crews, like, is Crackdown 3 right now after E3. And that's a great, like, marriage.

746
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:42,000
And you know what? Microsoft probably saw a lot of those tweets about Terry Crews doing Doomfist and they probably called him.

747
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:47,000
So the community did make something- I would bet the community did make that happen for Terry Crews in a way.

748
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:57,000
I mean, his talents did that too. But my point is, is that, like, don't disrespect this other voice actor because maybe they were looking for somebody that just could deliver a different voice that wasn't-

749
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Because Doomfist, I mean, he's not subdued, but he's not like, oh, yeah, like, over the top, like, whoa, you know, he's not like that at all.

750
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Like, so I think maybe this voice actor they went with is just giving the performance that they wanted.

751
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:24,000
So I just- I just- I just think it's really shitty when I see those tweets, like, with this other voice actor mentioned and tagged in them going, should have been Terry Crews.

752
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:34,000
You know what? The business- the business is- sucks sometimes, but at the same time, I will get props to Terry Crews and I'm not blaming him at all for this.

753
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:41,000
I think Terry Crews is handling it like a professional because he wrote a very nice tweet and he said, Doomfist came out awesome.

754
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:49,000
It was everything I'd hoped for, like, I'm paraphrasing the tweet, but he wrote a very nice tweet that was like, hey, Doomfist rules, even though I'm not voicing it.

755
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:57,000
So, you know, he didn't, you know, you know what I mean? Like, he wrote a very nice tweet, which is exactly what a professional does and so that was cool.

756
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:06,000
So I don't blame Terry Crews at all for any of this fuckery I see on Twitter when people start replying about like, you know, fuck Blizzard, it should have been Terry Crews.

757
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Like, you know what? Sometimes the vision just lined up a different way. You know, give this other guy a chance, give Doomfist a chance.

758
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:18,000
He's an awful lot of fun to play and yes, the voice work is great as well. So there you go.

759
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Let's see. Also, what is a chat over at live.fognetwork.com. Oh, great question from Bobby Blackwolf.

760
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Is Terry Crews SAG-AFTRA and could it be, and I'm inferring from that, could it be related to the whole strike thing?

761
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
I doubt it because he's doing voicing for Microsoft.

762
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Yeah, and the actor they did pick is a screen actor who has on-screen roles.

763
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:50,000
So this other actor they went with has to be a card member of SAG, has to be.

764
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:57,000
So I don't think, well, and for all we know, I mean, the voice work actually could have been done a long time ago.

765
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Because again, we knew about Doomfist when they first announced the game.

766
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:07,000
So it's entirely possible that the voice acting was done a long time ago before the strike happened.

767
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
But it's a good thought there.

768
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Let's see. Oh, interesting. Over in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Tigerclaw says,

769
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:24,000
I think it's more like Terry Crews wanted to be in the game more than them asking him if he wants to be in it.

770
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:30,000
But I don't fault Terry Crews for that. I would love to be a voice actor in a video game.

771
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:35,000
I think that would be fucking awesome. Wouldn't that be fun to voice a character in a video game someday?

772
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I think that would be great. But I also understand I'm not a professional and they're probably going to hire professionals.

773
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
And I'm OK with that. I got my podcast. It's cool.

774
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:50,000
So, you know, if there's a little indie game someday that maybe I can do a voice over in. Cool.

775
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,000
But, you know, I'm not a professional. We'll leave it to them.

776
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:00,000
So let's see. CrazyChocobonator in chat says,

777
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:06,000
to be honest, Doomfist doesn't sound like a video game character's name, more like an extreme version of fisting.

778
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Yes. Yes. There's there's been plenty of those jokes over on Twitter.

779
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,000
It sounds like an Invader Zim character.

780
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,000
SSJ100Matt with a good comparison here. Growing up,

781
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:21,000
I always wanted Kurt Russell to be Wolverine in a live action X-Men movie.

782
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:26,000
After seeing Hugh Jackman do it. Well, he did a far better job than Russell could have done.

783
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Oh, you know, the classic example of that in Hollywood classic.

784
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Do you remember when they announced Heath Ledger is going to play the Joker?

785
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Yes. And you remember how everybody was like, what the fuck?

786
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
And that wasn't the first time it happened with Batman either. You go further back.

787
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Michael Keaton. When they announced Michael Keaton was going to play Batman, everybody.

788
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
The comedian? The comedian? Beetlejuice?

789
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,000
It's going to be bad. What the fuck? Like the Internet wasn't really around back then.

790
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
But you better believe there was still like campaign,

791
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:01,000
like whatever Twitter was back then in the form of postcards and stuff.

792
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Was that when Michael Keaton got to play Mr. Freeze?

793
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:09,000
It was. No, it was AOL chat rooms and BBS's.

794
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:15,000
I don't even. BBS's, yes. But the original Batman was like 1989.

795
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
I don't even think AOL was really. Maybe Quantum Link.

796
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Yeah, that would have been BBS's then. Yeah, BBS's.

797
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:28,000
So, yeah. So, I mean, that is. I mean, if you want to kind of compare this to movies,

798
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
you know, when they announced that Heath Ledger got the part of the Joker,

799
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
I'm sure everybody was like Jack Nicholson five ever.

800
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Like there's nobody's ever going to be better than Jack Nicholson and all this stuff.

801
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:44,000
And it's like, you know, they were different interpretations of the role.

802
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Like Jack Nicholson. Nothing about Heath Ledger's amazing, mind blowing fucking performance as Joker.

803
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Nothing about that diminished the also amazing job that Jack Nicholson did.

804
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:01,000
The only thing that tarnished the role of the Joker was Jared Leto.

805
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Sorry, cheap shot. I could help myself. Sorry. Cheap shot. Cheap shot.

806
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:09,000
To be honest, I don't even blame Jared Leto because I thought he looked kind of cool as the Joker.

807
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:14,000
I think just the script sucked. So, I mean, I'm not even going to blame Jared Leto for that.

808
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,000
I'm just saying that script was just fucking terrible.

809
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:24,000
So anyway, we're getting a little off track. But my point is, I think after that point,

810
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:29,000
after Christopher Nolan cast Heath Ledger as the Joker and everybody was like,

811
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,000
what the fuck, buddy? And then everybody saw that movie.

812
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:37,000
After that, it was kind of like, okay, Christopher Nolan can do whatever the fuck he wants.

813
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Like clearly the man knows what he's doing. So when they announced Anne Hathaway as Catwoman,

814
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:47,000
I have to admit there was a part of me that was like, I'm not sure that's what I would have done.

815
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:53,000
But you know what? I would have said the same thing about Heath Ledger.

816
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:59,000
So I'm going to, and sure enough Anne Hathaway was a, for that version of the Catwoman,

817
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:04,000
for what Nolan was doing in that movie, she was fine. She was better than fine. She was great.

818
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Michelle Pfeiffer will kind of always be Catwoman to me in that role.

819
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:15,000
But even then, you go back to like Eartha Kitt and like the campy 60's stuff.

820
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Julie Newmar.

821
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Julie Newmar, Eartha Kitt, like the classic 60's Batman actresses.

822
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Like they also owned it in their own way. It was just all different. So anyway.

823
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
I'm sure Halle Berry owned it in her own way.

824
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Look, Halle Berry is a great example that even great actresses can make mistakes.

825
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
So you know what? It's all right. Anyway, we're getting off track.

826
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:42,000
It is a video game show, but I'm bringing all that up as comparisons that it's like, you know what?

827
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,000
They cast somebody else's Doomfist and he's doing great.

828
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:51,000
So this Terry Crews stuff, even Terry Crews says he loves Doomfist.

829
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:55,000
So the rest of you need to stop with the bullshit on Twitter and let the guys who are,

830
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:00,000
gals who are creating Overwatch create the game they want to make. Done.

831
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
So Terry Crews, he's still going to be a part of the gaming community.

832
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,000
He's just over there on Crackdown 3, which I bet most of you are going to be buying anyway.

833
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:13,000
So I think everybody's winning in this scenario. I really do.

834
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:20,000
All right. Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

835
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:25,000
JD calling me out on the EarthaKit thing, but I said that before I looked in chat.

836
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:29,000
It was just very different. But here's the other thing to consider.

837
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:35,000
I was like 13 or 14 years old when Batman Returns came out.

838
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:40,000
And in a way, so, okay, I'm going to go, I'm really tangent training tonight,

839
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
but it's a slow news week, okay?

840
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:47,000
So Bobby brought up his old comparison about Final Fantasy on his show earlier, right?

841
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:52,000
And he said, you know, it seems to be that the favorite Final Fantasy game of people

842
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,000
is the Final Fantasy game that came out when you were around 13 years old, right?

843
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
That tends to be your favorite Final Fantasy game.

844
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
And for me, that's true. It really is.

845
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Like Final Fantasy 2 and 3 on the Super Nintendo, which of course were 4 and 6.

846
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Those are kind of like a tie for my favorite. So I get that.

847
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,000
I would say your favorite Batman movie might be the same sort of thing.

848
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:17,000
And Batman Returns was that movie that came out right when I was around 13 or 14.

849
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:22,000
And I kind of think to this day that movie is grossly underrated in the Batman franchise.

850
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
That movie is fucking amazing.

851
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:28,000
And Michelle Pfeiffer just, you know, like to a little gay boy at 13 years old,

852
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,000
like Michelle Pfeiffer was just everything and then some.

853
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,000
So you know what? Dark Soccer, you loved her too, right? Please, please tell me.

854
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Meow.

855
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Yes.

856
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
When she did all the flips and she's like, meow.

857
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:44,000
One thing that I thought was awesome though is that the first whip scene in the department store,

858
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
she did it in one take.

859
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Yeah.

860
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
I was like, that made me want to whip.

861
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Right?

862
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,000
I just wanted to take the heads off of men who opposed me.

863
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:57,000
And I'm sorry, did I say that out loud? I meant mannequins. Mannequins.

864
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Representing.

865
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Presenting the patriarchy, which I will dismantle with my whip.

866
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:07,000
And chat says, I think Halle Berry is a good sport over it.

867
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
I think she accepted her Razzie for Catwoman.

868
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Yeah, I hear she was a good sport about it.

869
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:16,000
She knows it's a shit movie and she just, if you can't laugh at yourself, what can you laugh at?

870
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
You know what though? To be fair to Halle Berry,

871
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:24,000
if Ryan Reynolds can be both the terrible Green Lantern and the fucking awesome Deadpool,

872
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
you got a chance to stay.

873
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
And the terrible Deadpool.

874
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
But not his fault.

875
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
He was also the terrible Deadpool.

876
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
He was also the terrible Deadpool.

877
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
That is true, he was the terrible Deadpool.

878
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
That was Dev's.

879
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,000
But he was the best part before they made him the terrible Deadpool.

880
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Yes, correct.

881
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Yes, I forgot about that.

882
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Who knew it was going to turn into movie chat on OLR tonight?

883
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
But you know what? Tangents, they happen.

884
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
You know, it's inevitable.

885
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Games, movies, they go hand in hand.

886
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Alright, Dark Sakura, you got some good news for us this week, right?

887
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Well, we did bring up the summer games done quick a little bit earlier.

888
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:01,000
And I watched bits and pieces of it here and there, certain runs.

889
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
The whole thing was pretty amazing.

890
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:07,000
They beat last year's goal by a significant amount.

891
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Or not last year's goal, but last year's total.

892
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Last year, they pulled in $1,294,139.

893
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:19,000
This year, $1,760,415.

894
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Nice.

895
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:25,000
So by topping it by almost $500,000 is pretty amazing.

896
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
That's some great incentives, too.

897
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:33,000
I'm sad that I missed the solo co-op Portal 2 run.

898
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,000
But at least you can go back and catch all of those.

899
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Yeah, I missed most of that stuff live.

900
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,000
But thankfully, they're really quick to put that stuff up onto YouTube.

901
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
So, yeah.

902
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Especially, you know, I tried watching.

903
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
I was like, ooh, Final Fantasy VII run.

904
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Eight hours long.

905
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Nope, not watching this whole thing.

906
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Some of the crowd interaction was, for me, not just, you know, the commentary couch,

907
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
but the way the crowd interacted with it.

908
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Like, they were singing along with the Disney songs in Kingdom Hearts 2.

909
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:10,000
And, like, when the guy was doing Pungoland, which is just, like, a really...

910
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,000
It was kind of based on Kaizo Mario, but not bad.

911
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Every time the guy would die, they'd hold up a sign and they'd go,

912
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,000
16, you know, for every number that he died.

913
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:25,000
And I watched the Mega Man X6 and the X2 run.

914
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:29,000
And it was just amazing watching how good people get with these games

915
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
and watching some of the clipping tricks.

916
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:35,000
And the thing that I like about it is that they have people...

917
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Some of the people doing the commentary are also speedrunners of that game.

918
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Yeah, yeah.

919
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
And I'm glad that I watched the Super Metroid run.

920
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Did you hear about the big upset?

921
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
You were texting me, and I think I saw that, like,

922
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
two of them got knocked out right at the beginning, right?

923
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Right with the first big boss.

924
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
That, wow.

925
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Both of them died.

926
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
You know what, though?

927
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Props to them for getting up on stage and doing it.

928
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
It's a lot of pressure.

929
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
It's a lot of pressure, you know?

930
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
And sometimes you're gonna make mistakes.

931
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
So I hope those guys aren't feeling too bad.

932
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
But, at any rate, though, so they finally just focused on the last guy

933
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:13,000
who I don't think had ever done anything for the event before.

934
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:19,000
He's, like, a fairly new speedrunner, and he finished Super Metroid, like, perfectly.

935
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:26,000
And this is, I think, the first year that, without any extra help from the sponsor or anything,

936
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
that they got more for Kill the Animals.

937
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,000
You know, one of our old-school listeners...

938
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,000
I know he doesn't listen anymore, but he's a big part of that speed event.

939
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Kevin DDR does the Tetris stuff.

940
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,000
I hear he did very well on that block.

941
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Oh, yeah. We was watching it. It was pretty crazy.

942
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Yeah. No, I know. We do have listeners from, you know, years ago

943
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,000
that go on to bigger and better things that are even bigger than this show.

944
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
But it's awesome. I love that.

945
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
I love that when, like, I see people, it's like,

946
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
oh, I knew that person when they were listening to OLR.

947
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,000
That was, like, really stupidly fast, too.

948
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
I had to watch part of that.

949
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

950
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:09,000
But, overall, the great thing about this is it's going to a really good cause.

951
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
I'm not going to do it in French. It's the Doctors Without Borders.

952
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Yeah.

953
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:21,000
And I think that we need to have more charities along those lines

954
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,000
get attention because they provide the treatment

955
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:30,000
no matter any, you know, walk that the person comes from who needs it.

956
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Right.

957
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:35,000
And they even go into places where there is some pretty nasty stuff going on,

958
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:39,000
like war zones and things like that and provide necessary help.

959
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:43,000
They were a huge part of, like, when that Ebola crisis was going on

960
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
not that long ago.

961
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Totally, totally.

962
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
You know, they were a huge part of help and make sure that didn't get worse.

963
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,000
But the other thing, too, is that it's nice to see something that,

964
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:55,000
for us, was, you know, kind of, you know, just hobby and leisure and fun

965
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:59,000
that, you know, has turned into something so wonderful.

966
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
And the next one's going to be, of course, in January.

967
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
With awesome games done quick.

968
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Which is technically the flagship run, but, I mean, they're both kind of...

969
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Some of those prizes that were pretty nuts.

970
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Let me ask this. What do you think contributes to, I mean,

971
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,000
because half a million more, that's quite a bit more money.

972
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Do you think that's just maybe as simple as it's the logistics

973
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,000
of where the 4th of July fell this year, that you had a lot more people

974
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
along weekends that could sit at home and watch it?

975
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Or do you think maybe this speed running stuff in this particular marathon

976
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
is getting more and more visibility?

977
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
I mean, we saw during awesome games done quick,

978
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
one of the guys went on Colbert, right?

979
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Yeah.

980
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Yeah, so do you think just in general this whole scene

981
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
is getting more and more visibility in this particular marathon?

982
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
I think it's a combination of both of those factors,

983
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
but I truly do believe that it's the visibility.

984
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:48,000
I mean, and one thing that, you know, I think that the people

985
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,000
who scoffed at, you know, gaming in the 80s

986
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,000
don't seem to realize is that we all grew up.

987
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Well, yeah, yeah, I think that's what it is.

988
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Those of us that were playing games in the 80s, we're now the adults.

989
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
So it's...

990
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Exactly.

991
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Yeah, it's time to change.

992
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,000
And gaming culture is even more prevalent.

993
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,000
I mean, a lot of these systems are a lot easier to come by.

994
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,000
If not, you know, the current gen, there's the older ones that you can get.

995
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,000
And then classic gaming itself has become a lot more prevalent.

996
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,000
You have people, you know, some of these people who were doing

997
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,000
some of the speed runs on some of the classic games

998
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:26,000
were probably born the year that game came out.

999
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Yeah.

1000
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:31,000
You know, and to see them enduring like this, I mean,

1001
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,000
it does my ancient heart good.

1002
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,000
You know, I have to admit, and maybe I'm probably going to get a little shit

1003
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
for this comment, but I have to just be honest with you all for a minute.

1004
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Like, I'm getting to that point now where some of these conventions

1005
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,000
that I've gone to, I kind of start to look around

1006
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,000
and I kind of go, I'm the old guy here.

1007
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Am I getting too old for these conventions?

1008
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Never.

1009
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
I know, I know, but I can't help it.

1010
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
There's certain conventions I've gone to where I kind of go,

1011
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,000
like, I could be everybody's dad.

1012
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
It's a weird feeling.

1013
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
But I always say the one convention I don't feel that with at all

1014
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,000
is Dragon Con, because I feel like Dragon Con kind of like,

1015
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
I think because it's been around so fucking long,

1016
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,000
a lot of people in Atlanta that were going when they were 15

1017
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
are still going now that they're 40.

1018
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,000
So I think...

1019
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
See, here's the problem.

1020
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,000
If you're sitting there, you know, questioning, am I the old guy there,

1021
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
that means you're not intoxicated enough.

1022
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
So that's...

1023
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
And I'm not trying to turn it into a pissing match

1024
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,000
of who's the oldest here at VOG and OLR and all that stuff.

1025
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:32,000
I'm just saying, in general, I'm starting to feel like

1026
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
sometimes I'm the oldest person there and I'm like,

1027
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,000
oh, this is a little weird.

1028
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Hey, I'm still going to cosplay as long as I can.

1029
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
And I think at the end of the day, don't get me wrong,

1030
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,000
I fucking get over it, I always do, you know,

1031
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,000
because, you know, age ain't nothing but a number, baby.

1032
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,000
But I'd be lying if I hadn't said sometimes I go to the cons

1033
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:52,000
and I go, am I the oldest one here?

1034
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Let's see.

1035
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Yes, there it is, on time, the comments in chat,

1036
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
shut the fuck up about getting old.

1037
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Tigerclaw in chat says, the majority of speedrunners are very young.

1038
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:09,000
I would love to see someone in their 40s or 50s do a speedrun at the event.

1039
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Ha, ha, ha.

1040
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Well, cheap plug, Tigerclaw, but Flaco Jones here,

1041
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
who's been on OLR many times before

1042
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
and is part of the VoG Network family, really.

1043
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Flaco Jones is the same age as I am.

1044
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Like, we're only like a couple weeks apart with our birthdays

1045
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
and he's been submitting that PT speedrun.

1046
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:30,000
So I'm hoping he gets in just because it's a great speedrun

1047
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,000
and I think there's a great story behind PT anyway

1048
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:37,000
and the fact that, you know, somebody who's my age should be in there

1049
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
doing the speedruns too, that'd be great.

1050
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Ha, ha, ha.

1051
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:44,000
All right, all right, I'll stop with the topics

1052
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,000
that are going to get me the shut the fuck up comments.

1053
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Let's move on with some other stories. Loki.

1054
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,000
All right, so speaking of getting old,

1055
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:58,000
these complaints sound like something that an older individual would have with a game,

1056
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:03,000
but Ubisoft, much like, you know, other companies,

1057
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
will do something special with their games.

1058
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:08,000
They'll patch in like a cool holiday event

1059
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:12,000
and so because of, you know, July 4th being Independence Day,

1060
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:17,000
they patched in some fireworks that appear during the nighttime in the game.

1061
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:22,000
So between June 29th and July 10th, there'd be fireworks going off at night,

1062
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:26,000
which, you know, for most people it's like, eh, no big deal.

1063
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Except apparently a lot of people had problems with it.

1064
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,000
They thought it was completely obnoxious, fucking annoying,

1065
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
too frequent, too long, and too loud.

1066
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Apparently the fireworks were too loud

1067
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,000
and it was annoying them during night missions.

1068
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,000
So they would be like kind of sneaking around all of a sudden.

1069
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
There's just a lot of booming going on in the background.

1070
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:50,000
So, of course, you know, they heard about it, you know.

1071
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:55,000
They said, you know, it's not possible to wrestle a fix for this,

1072
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
so we made a tough choice just to remove them.

1073
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:01,000
It says the heart says no, but the eardrums say yes.

1074
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,000
I kind of want to see a video to see how loud they were.

1075
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Sadly, Watch Dogs 2 is one of those games I do need to go back and play

1076
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:13,000
because I did enjoy it, but just haven't played it in a long time.

1077
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,000
I would have been curious to see what the fireworks sounded like, though.

1078
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
That's kind of funny, though.

1079
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Is it one of those things where maybe it was being developed in a studio

1080
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,000
where they're using headphones or something, and on headphones it was okay,

1081
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
but then when it was like on the TV it was like, oh, my God.

1082
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Maybe, I don't know, but like someone was saying that it is scaring their dog.

1083
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,000
I mean, I get it, but like...

1084
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
But how loud was your television?

1085
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
It's like nitpicking, I think, it sounds like.

1086
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Just turn down the sound effects.

1087
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Like, okay, but I haven't played Watch Dogs 2,

1088
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:50,000
but I'm assuming there's like gunshots and like other loud things that happen.

1089
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
I would think that that would be louder, yes.

1090
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
So that doesn't set off the dogs?

1091
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,000
I mean, I don't know. I didn't see this fireworks thing,

1092
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
so I don't know if people are being silly or not,

1093
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:04,000
but it is a little weird to me that like if the gunshots and gunfights

1094
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
that happen in these games don't set off the animals.

1095
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,000
For one, if it is setting off the animals, you should probably turn your TV down

1096
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:13,000
or think about headphones, because there's some great wireless headsets

1097
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
for all the systems now that you can pick up.

1098
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:19,000
So, I mean, just saying, just saying.

1099
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Yeah, so apparently, okay, so here's why it was like that,

1100
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:27,000
because they're saying that apparently a company rep noted that

1101
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,000
the people have spoken, we have carried out their will.

1102
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:34,000
There was an annoying bug that snuck into our Independence Day event

1103
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:39,000
that made the sound effects from the fireworks noticeable from everywhere on the map.

1104
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:43,000
They have been turned off as to avoid further noise complaints.

1105
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:48,000
It could be that, because I know like with developing some games and stuff,

1106
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:53,000
that instead of having a positional audio, it's basically just like almost like a sound effect,

1107
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:57,000
like a menu effect, and so basically you're hearing it the same volume

1108
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:00,000
no matter how close you are to those fireworks.

1109
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
So maybe that was the situation.

1110
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:07,000
But, I mean, it seems like if that was the case, it'd be easy for them to fix, but whatever.

1111
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
You people are just getting old.

1112
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
If it's too loud, you're too old.

1113
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Okay, so I am gonna, I have to listen to hear what this sounds like real quick,

1114
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:20,000
so I'm just gonna quickly just...

1115
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Can you, can you...

1116
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Okay, those are pretty fucking loud actually, now that I hear.

1117
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Can you copy-paste me the link real quick so we can play it over the air?

1118
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Huh?

1119
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Can you copy...

1120
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Yes, I can.

1121
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
Can you copy-paste me the link so we can play it over the air real quick?

1122
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Yes, it is pretty loud actually, now that I see that, so...

1123
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Yeah, I want to have some frame of reference here, because maybe...

1124
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,000
So let's...

1125
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Maybe I am being too harsh on the complainers.

1126
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:46,000
So, alright, so Loki said this is what you get when it's live.

1127
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Sometimes there's unscripted moments that happen, including links to YouTube videos.

1128
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Okay, so I'm gonna look at this YouTube from Nate152.

1129
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:15,000
I would think it is kind of loud, but I would think it's one of those things that would be like,

1130
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:19,000
it's more annoying if that is going on the entire...

1131
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Because that's pretty frequent.

1132
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:26,000
If that's going on the entire time you're trying to play the game, that would be kind of annoying.

1133
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:32,000
If it was one of those things where that happens for like 30 seconds every 15 minutes or something,

1134
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
then I think it would be a lot more tolerable.

1135
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Or, like what is being mentioned there, that you have to be in a certain area to hear it would be fine.

1136
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:46,000
But I think it's not... I don't even know if it's so much the volume thing, because again,

1137
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
I think the gunshots would probably be just as loud in that game,

1138
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:53,000
but it's just the fact that it's constant and ongoing while you're trying to play this other game.

1139
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
That part would be kind of annoying.

1140
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Alright, let's see.

1141
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

1142
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Yeah, Bobby Blackwolf says,

1143
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:07,000
It is going on the entire time, even inside buildings and in the water.

1144
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Yeah, that's a little ridiculous.

1145
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Yeah, and further on in the video, the guy's driving with his radio on,

1146
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
and you can't hear anything over the fireworks.

1147
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
It's just loud.

1148
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Alright, so maybe it is a little much, so fair enough, fair enough.

1149
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Alright, thank you for finding the video there so we could judge for ourselves.

1150
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Alright, let's move on to a story about emulation.

1151
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,000
A couple stories here about Nintendo emulation,

1152
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:34,000
including some people that have been peeking at the Nintendo Switch

1153
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
and some of the internal parts of it.

1154
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Some of the modders who are working on the Switch right now,

1155
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:43,000
because of course, hackers gonna hack, modders gonna mod, right?

1156
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,000
We all know this.

1157
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Apparently, they have found there is an NES emulator embedded in the firmware,

1158
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,000
and it's code named Flog.

1159
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:58,000
I don't know why, but it is worth pointing out Flog is golf spelled backwards.

1160
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:02,000
So maybe this emulator is gonna emulate NES golf.

1161
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,000
I bet that's what it is, right? Anyway.

1162
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
But that is the NES emulator.

1163
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:10,000
It's apparently hiding already within the Switch.

1164
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
So yeah, it's already embedded in the firmware.

1165
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:18,000
But of course, you have to kind of trust modders that have been in the system looking at stuff.

1166
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:22,000
There's no way to otherwise conclusively prove this.

1167
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:26,000
But it wouldn't surprise me that they're building that out,

1168
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:33,000
because we know that we will get Dr. Mario, Super Mario Bros. 3,

1169
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:39,000
that will all be a part of this online thing when Nintendo Online officially rolls out.

1170
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Which is kind of, we're getting baby steps with everything that's happening with Splatoon 2,

1171
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
which I know we haven't talked a lot about tonight,

1172
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
but Splatoon 2 had a Direct this week,

1173
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:53,000
and Splatoon 2, that's all gonna kick off with the first Splatfest next week,

1174
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
and there's this whole online app that goes with it, right?

1175
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:59,000
So we know the NES games are coming,

1176
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:04,000
so it wouldn't surprise me that there's a NES emulator in there as well.

1177
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
SSJ100Matt in chat says,

1178
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Modders were working on a Switch emulator day one.

1179
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Oh, of course, of course they were.

1180
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
JD in chat says,

1181
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Maybe Nintendo will be a sponsor of Folsom Street Events.

1182
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Cause it's flogging, get it?

1183
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
That's funny, I like that.

1184
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Anyhow, speaking of emulation,

1185
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,000
of course everybody fucking wants an SNES mini.

1186
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Like everybody wants a fucking SNES mini,

1187
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
and we all know Nintendo's not gonna make enough,

1188
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,000
and I already went on my rant about scalpers last week,

1189
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:39,000
or the week before maybe, so if you didn't hear it, go back and listen to it.

1190
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:46,000
But, at least thank god some online retailers are trying to do some things about it.

1191
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Amazon UK being one of them.

1192
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Apparently they actually went so far as to contact customers to notify them

1193
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:58,000
that if they preordered more than one SNES mini,

1194
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:03,000
it was going to be changed to a max of one console per customer.

1195
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:08,000
So anybody who ordered multiple consoles will now just receive one.

1196
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Yay! This is a start!

1197
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:14,000
It's not perfect, cause certainly there's gonna be people that are like,

1198
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Oh, well now I'm gonna sign on to my spouse's account and my kid's account,

1199
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
you know, so they'll get around it.

1200
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:27,000
But, this is a good start, and should hopefully deter some of those room full of SNES minis and NES classics and all that stuff.

1201
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:34,000
I believe eBay is doing something as well to try to combat this a little bit.

1202
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:41,000
I think eBay's thing though, they are doing a, you can't actually put something on eBay

1203
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:44,000
that is more than 90 days out of its official release.

1204
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:47,000
That they should. I don't think preorders should be on eBay at all, to be honest.

1205
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Yeah, so they're scaling it back a bit.

1206
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Yeah, I'm with SSJ100, Matt, still waiting for Amazon to do US preorders.

1207
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Yeah, what about, I mean, I guess I'm okay if Amazon is taking the time to make sure the system doesn't

1208
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:07,000
What if they don't do preorders in the US?

1209
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:12,000
I don't see how Amazon doesn't do that. Oh, you mean just in general, Nintendo doesn't do any.

1210
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Because they're assholes.

1211
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
We'll see.

1212
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Amazon could also be focusing on all that Prime Day stuff, they probably don't want

1213
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,000
They've really been pushing that.

1214
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Yeah, they've really been pushing that.

1215
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:27,000
It's only for their Prime users that you get the book that SNES.

1216
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:34,000
I'd be okay with that. It would be kind of messed up, but I'm a Prime user, I'd be totally okay with that.

1217
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:41,000
But I understand where that might not be the best business decision for Amazon.

1218
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Well, what if Amazon did this? What if they did two preorder waves?

1219
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:49,000
And the first wave was Prime only and the second was whoever.

1220
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Would you feel that that was a dick move or no?

1221
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:55,000
I would think Nintendo wouldn't be okay with that.

1222
01:12:55,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Because they're basically locking it behind something. It seems kind of silly.

1223
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:10,000
In my opinion though, is it worse than when GameStop forces you to buy a bundle to get something?

1224
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Because I don't think so.

1225
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
But, yeah, I understand that.

1226
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:26,000
And that comes from more of there's no margin in anything, and so they have to make up their margin on that stuff by bundling in things that do have a margin for them.

1227
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:32,000
They figure if there's going to be a shortage like that, that they want to make sure they're guaranteed to sell through on that stuff.

1228
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:42,000
I think it's more akin to like, I'm going to charge you $20 to make a preorder on this item type of thing.

1229
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:45,000
And that doesn't go towards the item cost.

1230
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Yeah, at the end of the day, I'm with SSG100Matt in chat.

1231
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Honestly though, I have money.

1232
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Nintendo, just take it.

1233
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,000
I'm with you, buddy.

1234
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
It's a tiny Linux machine that plays NES ROMs.

1235
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,000
And I want it.

1236
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
I mean, that's like, just...

1237
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,000
And I want it, Loki.

1238
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Why can't you sell through on it?

1239
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Alright, let's move on. Let's move on to something more modern Dark Sakura.

1240
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
What do you have for us?

1241
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Five Nights at Freddy's 6.

1242
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:14,000
I bet we're all looking forward to it, aren't we?

1243
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,000
No.

1244
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Because it's been cancelled.

1245
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:22,000
I don't want to cheer. I know the game has its fans, so I'm not going to cheer this, but...

1246
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:26,000
I've been hearing that he's trolling his fans, actually, but we'll see.

1247
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Well, his quote, though, is that,

1248
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:34,000
After forcing myself to keep working on it day after day, I realized something. I just don't want to work on this.

1249
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:38,000
He thinks each game should be the last.

1250
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
But then...

1251
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
He doesn't want to do it. That's what he said.

1252
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,000
It might get done.

1253
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Let me ask a two-part question.

1254
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Dark Sakura, because you're a fan of Five Nights at Freddy's.

1255
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,000
Kind of.

1256
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
You've made me play the older games with you.

1257
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Remember when we did...

1258
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:54,000
One of my early Twitch streams was doing Five Nights 4 with you and Shane.

1259
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Yeah.

1260
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,000
And that's why I'm like, God, these fucking jumpscares.

1261
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:02,000
But, do you think it's possible that maybe it is all a troll?

1262
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:05,000
Because he does have a tendency to do these things where he's like,

1263
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
Oh, it's going to release in October.

1264
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Just kidding. It's out today.

1265
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:12,000
I don't know. I kind of don't care anymore.

1266
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Do you think the series has just jumped the shark in general?

1267
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:19,000
I don't know. I mean, it's fans. There's people who will play it.

1268
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:24,000
But, at this point, I don't really get excited about releases anymore.

1269
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Only a few here and there.

1270
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Or about people working on them.

1271
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Because every time I get excited about it, my heart gets broken.

1272
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:36,000
So, I just don't care anymore.

1273
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:40,000
I will see the game when it's out and then I will be excited.

1274
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Was Five Nights at Freddy World that bad? I'm just kidding.

1275
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
I didn't play it, honestly.

1276
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:49,000
I think a lot of people passed on it after hearing some of the initial responses.

1277
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:53,000
But, at the same time, I can also kind of...

1278
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Like, I can completely sympathize with this guy if it's not a troll.

1279
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:01,000
And this is like, I'm really ready to fucking do something else.

1280
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:04,000
And I think that's kind of what Five Nights at Freddy World was.

1281
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Is this guy probably feels like, oh my god, this is the only thing I can ever do.

1282
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:12,000
And maybe he's kind of getting sick of it. You know what I mean?

1283
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Like, I've always said, we'll stop doing OLR when we stop having fun with it.

1284
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:21,000
You know? So, maybe if this guy is not having fun with it anymore.

1285
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Or is seeing the joy in it and wants to do other projects that he does see joy in.

1286
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Even if they don't turn out as great, like Five Nights at Freddy World started.

1287
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Maybe he has the right to go do it, right? That's art!

1288
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:39,000
At any rate, he says he's not abandoning the series.

1289
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:42,000
So, we'll see what that means.

1290
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,000
He should just sell it to Microsoft.

1291
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
See what they do with it.

1292
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Alright, but there's still a movie happening at some point, I think, right?

1293
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
Yeah, we'll see.

1294
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Alright, Loki, what's next?

1295
01:16:55,000 --> 01:17:01,000
Alright, so on the mobile game front, definitely things are going pretty well.

1296
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:10,000
So, there has been apparently 150 million plus downloads of Super Mario Run.

1297
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Now, it's not necessarily purchases, but just at least downloads of that.

1298
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:19,000
They don't mention how many of those are actually purchases.

1299
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:27,000
They're saying though that they have, apparently Fire Emblem Heroes is doing pretty well as well.

1300
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:33,000
So, they've made, I guess they have 15 million downloads with that.

1301
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:38,000
They're saying though that there's still people paying for that as well.

1302
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:42,000
And then, of course, Animal Crossing will be coming soon.

1303
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:47,000
They haven't really updated us on Animal Crossing or Zelda or any of those other mobile projects they're working on, huh?

1304
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,000
No, not yet.

1305
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:53,000
And then on Pokemon Go front, there is the anniversary of Pokemon Go.

1306
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:59,000
So, starting July 6th, they're going to be running an event through July 24th.

1307
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:05,000
And you'll be able to catch a special Pikachu with Ash Ketchum's hat.

1308
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:09,000
So, good luck finding that because I found at least the last event.

1309
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:12,000
And I'm not sure about this one because I haven't seen any Pikachus yet.

1310
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:16,000
But for some stupid reason, there's no Pikachus that spawn during the entire event.

1311
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:20,000
But hey, there is something that you can get your hands on.

1312
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:23,000
That's a special anniversary box in the store.

1313
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
Yeah, buy that fucking consumable shit.

1314
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
It's a horrible value.

1315
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Unless you really like Ultra Balls and Max Survives, it's a horrible value.

1316
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Like, they've done some boxes.

1317
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
They did some when Gen 2 came out.

1318
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
They did some boxes that were a really good deal.

1319
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,000
These are not.

1320
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:44,000
So, I would just really think twice before buying it.

1321
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,000
I mean, because I think it's as much.

1322
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:52,000
The box costs as much as the raid passes and the incubators would anyway.

1323
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:55,000
And then it's like they kind of throw in some Ultra Balls and stuff.

1324
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
It's not the best deal.

1325
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:03,000
So, usually check your game once in a while because usually Pikachu spawns here at the house.

1326
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Have you caught one with the hat yet?

1327
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:07,000
No, I haven't. I haven't been very diligent looking.

1328
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:10,000
And it seems like when those events happen, that's when the Pikachus stop spawning here.

1329
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Exactly.

1330
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:15,000
That's what happened last time with the party hat or something like that.

1331
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Like, none of them.

1332
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:20,000
I was looking for it and nothing would spawn with the Pikachu.

1333
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:28,000
So, I can tell you a place downtown, like a park, that I think I heard is a Pikachu nest right now, downtown.

1334
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
So, it's not a good place to look.

1335
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Downtown too far for you, Logie?

1336
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Yeah, it is too far.

1337
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Just to get a stupid party hat on a character.

1338
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,000
I don't care. Pikachu's shit anyways in the game.

1339
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Yeah, it's kind of sad. I never use my Pikachu or Raichu.

1340
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Pikachu's are fucking impossible to catch and they're just shit.

1341
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
So, I don't know.

1342
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Why are the starter Pokemon so hard to catch? It makes no sense.

1343
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Have you done any of the raiding at all? The raidings are fun.

1344
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Yeah, I've done the raiding.

1345
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:03,000
There's a Flareon on your park over here that's on the raid right now.

1346
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:06,000
But I'm like, eh, I have a bunch of those.

1347
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:12,000
Boy, those raids pop up frequently. We just caught a Magikarp there earlier.

1348
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,000
Those are funny.

1349
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:19,000
Magikarp can be a raid, but sometimes it's kind of like, well, if I don't do this, I'm not going to do any raid today.

1350
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Well, plus the Magikarp that you catch, they're almost always wonders.

1351
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
So, they're really good for getting Gyarados.

1352
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Somebody pointed this out last week, is that you don't get wonders and eggs anymore.

1353
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:33,000
I'm sorry, you don't get Magikarp's and eggs anymore.

1354
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
So, if you want to wonder Magikarp, you have to do the raid.

1355
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
So, it's a good way to get that.

1356
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:43,000
And I hear shinies seem to be showing up more on the raid thing, but I have yet to get the shiny.

1357
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:49,000
So, anyway, let's talk about one more thing here before we get to the classic game of the week.

1358
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:52,000
And that has to do with the whole toys to games phenomenon.

1359
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,000
Or how the breaks are kind of on that right now.

1360
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:59,000
You know, Activision isn't doing a new Skylanders game this year.

1361
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:00,000
You probably noticed.

1362
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Yeah, they've run out of ideas like several years in a row.

1363
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
They weren't there at E3 this year.

1364
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:07,000
So, what's the deal? Is Activision done with Skylanders?

1365
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Did the death of Disney Infinity lead to toys to games kind of going away?

1366
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Well, there's a comment here from Activision's CEO that was being interviewed here.

1367
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:23,000
It is trying to look up the guy's name.

1368
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:29,000
There it is. Eric Hirschberg, the CEO of Activision, said a new market has been created with Skylanders.

1369
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:35,000
It was a way of making toys relevant to 21st century kids who are interactive entertainment consumers in their DNA.

1370
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:39,000
And so, on one level, it wasn't surprising to see that rush into the genre.

1371
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:42,000
But it certainly did create a more difficult macro environment.

1372
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Skylanders, we're still behind it.

1373
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:49,000
We have supported Imaginators with expansion packs in the way that we didn't with previous games.

1374
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:52,000
We have a great Skylanders TV series on Netflix.

1375
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
I had no idea that Skylanders was on Netflix.

1376
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:58,000
Yeah, great to stretch, but yeah, they do have a series on Netflix.

1377
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:02,000
I guess Netflix does really try to get a lot of kids programming because Netflix is kind of great for that.

1378
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:05,000
I try to get my kids to watch it and they didn't want to.

1379
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:09,000
Also mentioning, we have a mobile game in development that we're really excited about.

1380
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:12,000
And we're going to see what the right way to continue to invest in it.

1381
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
What I know is that people love those characters in that world.

1382
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
There's nothing broken about the franchise.

1383
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:21,000
It just became a little bit more different as a business proposition with all that competition.

1384
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
We shall see how it plays out.

1385
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Well, there you go.

1386
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
But there wasn't that much competition.

1387
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:33,000
In fact, actually I would say last year there was just Lego Dimensions and that was your only competition.

1388
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:37,000
Well, Bobby Blackwolf in chat over at live.voguenetwork.com says,

1389
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Rumors and sources a few months ago said that Lego Dimensions has been discontinued as well.

1390
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:45,000
They allegedly canceled some of the year two expansion packs.

1391
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Womp womp.

1392
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
I'm fine with that.

1393
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
They put out a ton of content.

1394
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Yeah, they did support that one game with a shit ton of content.

1395
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:57,000
To be fair, I'm blaming Lego for this.

1396
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:00,000
That shit's fucking expensive.

1397
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:04,000
It's a stupid Lego upcharge and all that shit.

1398
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Those packs are too damn expensive.

1399
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
The characters are too damn expensive.

1400
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,000
I love Legos.

1401
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:12,000
I would totally buy all those without even owning the game.

1402
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:16,000
But that shit is too fucking expensive to own as it is now.

1403
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Yeah, I hear you. I hear you.

1404
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Alright, well you know what? Let's travel back to a simpler time, shall we?

1405
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:28,000
When you didn't have to have extra toys. Toys were toys. Figures were figures.

1406
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:31,000
And you used your imagination to play them.

1407
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:34,000
And meanwhile you had your console that was for your video games.

1408
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:37,000
And you needed a controller and maybe a power glove.

1409
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,000
But that was it.

1410
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
And incoherent screaming.

1411
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:45,000
It's time for the classic game of the week where Dark Soccer is going to step into the vault and find a game that she thinks,

1412
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:49,000
Hey, you brats, you should be checking out this game this week instead.

1413
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?

1414
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:54,000
I picked Dragon Ball Z Hyperdimension.

1415
01:23:54,000 --> 01:24:01,000
Which came out for Super Famicom in Japan on March 29th, 1996.

1416
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:07,000
And for Super Nintendo in Europe in February 1997.

1417
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:13,000
This is also the last of the Dragon Ball Z games to come out for the Super Famicom.

1418
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:20,000
It basically follows the anime. It went through the Frieza stuff, the Kid Buu stuff.

1419
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:26,000
You have to continue credits after certain characters' deaths.

1420
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:30,000
And some of it is not quite perfect with the story.

1421
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:35,000
But the thing that I really liked about this game in particular is the desperation moves.

1422
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:43,000
You basically start off with a life bar of 99 points or whatever.

1423
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:50,000
And you can charge it from 1 to 99. Sorry, I was missing that.

1424
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:56,000
But when it hits below 80 you get your desperation moves that cause higher damage.

1425
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:59,000
And it also has different tiers on the levels.

1426
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:04,000
So you can fly and hit from your different levels.

1427
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:08,000
You can do the background and foreground kind of like in Fatal Fury.

1428
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:11,000
And it was just a really solid fighting game.

1429
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:17,000
The other thing too is that since this was a later Super Famicom game.

1430
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:20,000
The sprites are super gorgeous.

1431
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:25,000
I mean it's one of the prettiest, I would say, fighting games that came out on the system.

1432
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:31,000
It also has a tournament mode so you can play with up to 8 people.

1433
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:38,000
In a tournament style game, I mean pretty much it's called tournament mode.

1434
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:47,000
But you also have a full practice mode for practicing your attacks and all of that too.

1435
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:56,000
And you can also do an extra type of versus mode that lets you either fight against a character.

1436
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:02,000
Or for 2 players against each other. It's how it was with fighting games.

1437
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
The thing I liked was the tournament mode.

1438
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:09,000
And I was lucky enough one time to play a tournament mode with this game when I was in college.

1439
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
It was really fun.

1440
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:15,000
You've got a cast of 8 characters.

1441
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:19,000
And you've got some non-playable characters.

1442
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:25,000
The story mode in here is a little bit different.

1443
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:29,000
It didn't have exactly the right characterizations for who played what.

1444
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:32,000
But it was a really good game.

1445
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:45,000
On top of that, you also have special fights that you can do if you clear a story mode without using a Senzu Bean.

1446
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:49,000
And one of them is fighting Gotenks, which is actually a fun fight.

1447
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:53,000
So anyway, there's really not much to say about this game.

1448
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:57,000
It only came out on the Super Famicom.

1449
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:00,000
It wasn't released for any other system.

1450
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:05,000
One of the disappointing things about this is that it didn't have my favorite character in it.

1451
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Which was playing Future Trunks.

1452
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
But it was also the first one that you could play as Buen.

1453
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
And that was pretty cool.

1454
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:16,000
But the game that was just...

1455
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:21,000
I mean, I could talk about Shinbutoden, which was on Saturn.

1456
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:25,000
I still think this is honestly almost a better game.

1457
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
And that's it.

1458
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Dragon Ball Z Hyperdimension.

1459
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,000
But this is not...

1460
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:36,000
Now, you'll have to forgive me because my knowledge on the import games for Super Nintendo is not as strong.

1461
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:40,000
But this is not the only Dragon Ball Z game on Super Nintendo, right?

1462
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:43,000
Because I remember playing one, but it wasn't this.

1463
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:46,000
Because I'm looking at this and I'm like, no, this is not the game I played.

1464
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:52,000
No, there was Super Butoden 2 and then 3.

1465
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:55,000
And then Hyperdimension was the last one.

1466
01:27:55,000 --> 01:28:04,000
And then they went on to the Saturn one, which had Shinbutoden and Ultimate Battle 22 for PlayStation.

1467
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:10,000
And then we had GT, which actually GT was the first one that came out, out here.

1468
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:15,000
Which I sold that game so fast. It was not very good.

1469
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:19,000
I kind of wish I waited to sell it because it was worth some money.

1470
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:22,000
You know, and I got rid of it at the wrong time.

1471
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:25,000
But hey, it's a fun game though.

1472
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:29,000
I wouldn't say that it's among my favorites of the series.

1473
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:34,000
I honestly do like Super Butoden 3 a little bit better than this one.

1474
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:39,000
But it is notable as being one of the last games in the series on that system.

1475
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:42,000
And also it's just fucking pretty.

1476
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
It was a very late Super Nintendo release in general.

1477
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:47,000
It was. It's really, really well done.

1478
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:52,000
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Dragon Ball Z Hyperdimension.

1479
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
Dark Soccer's been on a Dragon Ball kick lately.

1480
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:58,000
I figured I'd have to mention one of the games since I haven't done one before.

1481
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:01,000
Yeah, fair enough. I mean, there were a ton.

1482
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:06,000
Also, it was back in a day when the internet wasn't as prolific.

1483
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
As in, it wasn't there.

1484
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:12,000
So, we didn't really get knowledge of a lot of those games that were in Japan only.

1485
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:13,000
You know what I mean?

1486
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:16,000
So, when we'd hear about them, it was like, why didn't we get this game?

1487
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:21,000
We had to order from importers that you found in the back of EGM.

1488
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:22,000
Yeah.

1489
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:25,000
Which is actually how I bought my first import game.

1490
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
Which is the Sailor Moon S fighting game.

1491
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:32,000
It had Chibi Moon's butt attack.

1492
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:36,000
I just remember the video store by me when I grew up,

1493
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:40,000
like, randomly rented some Super Famicom games,

1494
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:43,000
but they would have the converter with it,

1495
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:46,000
so that way when you rented it, you just plug it into your Super Nintendo.

1496
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:49,000
And the Dragon Ball, one of those Dragon Ball fighting games, I don't remember which one,

1497
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:52,000
but I would say it's the one that opens with the guy screaming,

1498
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
but I realize I could literally be any of them.

1499
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
That's any of them. It opens with someone screaming.

1500
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:02,000
So, but that was the first game I ever rented that was a Famicom game,

1501
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:05,000
but I played it on my Super Nintendo, and that was pretty cool.

1502
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Now, right before I moved out here, I came across,

1503
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:14,000
I had the Ranma ½ hard battle that came out in the US,

1504
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:22,000
and I found that they had the Japanese hard battle at this used game shop,

1505
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:25,000
and they couldn't sell it because no one wanted to buy it.

1506
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
It's Alabama. No one wanted to buy a game in Japanese.

1507
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:33,000
So I traded my copy, my US one for their Japanese one,

1508
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:36,000
because I had already made the mods to my game genie to play it,

1509
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:39,000
and I was so happy because I had all the good voices.

1510
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:43,000
So that's my story about the Ranma ½ hard battle fighting game.

1511
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,000
All right.

1512
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
And I still have that copy too.

1513
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Well, we're going to take a quick break, you guys.

1514
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:52,000
We'll be back, though. There's plenty more Orange Long Trader to come.

1515
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:55,000
We got more news, I think at least one email tonight,

1516
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:59,000
and phone calls at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype

1517
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:04,000
when we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1518
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:14,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio Live tonight,

1519
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:20,000
July 9th, 2017, episode number 693 of our show already in progress,

1520
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
and moving into the second half of the show.

1521
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:26,000
You know, I realized I forgot a game that I played this week

1522
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
because it was so fast.

1523
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:31,000
So Steam obviously had their huge sale, right?

1524
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:36,000
So I did do a little live stream of Pac-Man Championship Edition 2

1525
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
because I ended up buying that on Steam

1526
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
because it was only like five bucks or something like that,

1527
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
which last week, didn't we get an email that was like,

1528
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
what did you buy in the Steam sale?

1529
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
And at that point, I was like, nothing, but I probably will.

1530
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,000
Yeah.

1531
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Yeah, well, I did.

1532
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:51,000
But, you know, part of the whole Steam sale is that

1533
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
around the time the Steam sale happens,

1534
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:56,000
all these other, like, Microsoft was having a big sale on Xbox,

1535
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,000
PlayStation had a big sale.

1536
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
There's still happening a sale, actually.

1537
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
Is the PlayStation 1 still going on, too, or no?

1538
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:02,000
Yeah, I checked it the other day.

1539
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:09,000
Okay, so I bought for like $3.74 or something like that, $3.74.

1540
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:15,000
It was like a trio of old-ass arcade games, Pac-Man, Dig Dug, and Galaga.

1541
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:18,000
And I was like, oh, sure, I've had collections of these games before,

1542
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
but what the hell, it's like three bucks.

1543
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:23,000
So I picked up that and I started playing Dig Dug.

1544
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:28,000
And as I'm playing Dig Dug, oh, my God, I was popping like a trophy every five seconds.

1545
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:33,000
It was like, you got a fruit, trophy, you exploded a monster, trophy,

1546
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:38,000
you crushed two monsters with a rock, trophy, you beat round one, trophy,

1547
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
you beat round two, trophy.

1548
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:44,000
There was like so, for like a game that I essentially played a dollar for,

1549
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:47,000
there was probably like 30 trophies in Dig Dug.

1550
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Now, don't get me wrong, I think that's pretty cool.

1551
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:53,000
I know we talked a little bit about the whole trophy thing last week at the top of the show,

1552
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:58,000
but I think it's neat when you take an old-school arcade game like Dig Dug

1553
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:02,000
and do something modern to it like that, like trophies, but I was just like, dang.

1554
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:05,000
I didn't realize how freaking loaded this game was with achievements.

1555
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:06,000
I started going through the list.

1556
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:11,000
I was like, wow, they not only brought in the stuff from the Xbox 360 version of the game

1557
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:14,000
where you can dig out the entire board and get a trophy that way,

1558
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
but there was all sorts of stuff in there.

1559
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:19,000
So I thought that was just kind of funny.

1560
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:24,000
Something else, speaking of live streaming, because I did do that live stream.

1561
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:29,000
It's probably the only live stream I did this week was that stream of Pac-Man Championship Edition 2.

1562
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:35,000
I don't know if you guys saw in the office, but Alan bought me for my birthday a green screen.

1563
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:36,000
I saw.

1564
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
I know you said that. I haven't watched.

1565
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:42,000
At some point, go peek in the office because Alan's gaming there right now.

1566
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:46,000
It's like that room is split in two now with this giant green screen on PC.

1567
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:49,000
I was like, do we have an unknown spat?

1568
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:53,000
I know, right. Doesn't it look like that thing that siblings do when they're having a fight?

1569
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:54,000
They draw a line down the screen.

1570
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Yeah, I draw a line down the screen. This is your side of the room.

1571
01:33:56,000 --> 01:34:01,000
No, it's kind of what it looks like now. It's really funny, and it confuses the hell out of the cat.

1572
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:04,000
Unfortunately, because it gets really hot in there, like when I'm not using the green screen,

1573
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:10,000
I have to throw it up over the PVC pipe, but I don't want to wrinkle it because that fucks it up.

1574
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:13,000
But I have to get the airflow in there because, my God, it can get so...

1575
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Because, you know, here in Northern California, in the valley, it's like what?

1576
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Yesterday was 105, I think. It's been crazy hot over here.

1577
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
So, yeah, crazy, crazy.

1578
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:26,000
Anyway, go to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

1579
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:33,000
Dart Tetsuya says, I want to say Pac-Man Championship Edition Deluxe Plus was kind of like that with the trophies.

1580
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:39,000
Yeah, well, I think it had a handful of trophies, but then they had all their in-game achievements, too, which was interesting.

1581
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:43,000
So, yeah. But anyway, just something else I want to throw out there for my gaming week.

1582
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:48,000
Old-ass retro stuff. Pac-Man and Dig Dug, even if it is a newer Pac-Man game.

1583
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:52,000
And then the green screen, which is... It's still not working perfectly.

1584
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:57,000
We have to do this whole thing because there's still folds in it because when they mail it to you, it's all folded.

1585
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:00,000
And the folds are causing the green to not pick up right.

1586
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:04,000
And yes, I've been in OBS Chroma Key settings and changing everything.

1587
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
What's it made out of?

1588
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:09,000
Seriously, it could be a piece of fabric you bought at Jo-Ann's.

1589
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:16,000
You know what? Get a wet towel, put it in your dryer, and then tack the end down.

1590
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,000
Actually, the thing...

1591
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
Or wait, the bottom.

1592
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:24,000
So, Alan went online to try to troubleshoot this, and it's a similar idea.

1593
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:30,000
We saw a thing that was get a spray bottle, as your screen is hanging, spray down the screen,

1594
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:35,000
but not enough so that it's actually dripping water off it, but just enough to be wet.

1595
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
And then as it dries, it won't be wrinkled anymore.

1596
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
I thought that was an interesting solution.

1597
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:45,000
You can also get an iron with a steam function.

1598
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:46,000
Yeah.

1599
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
And air steam it.

1600
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:53,000
Tiger Kyle also points out, green screens require a good amount of lighting in order for it to work properly.

1601
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:54,000
Oh yes, I'm aware.

1602
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
I have another light, but here's the thing.

1603
01:35:56,000 --> 01:36:01,000
So the green screen kit, it did come with a light, but I'm a little afraid to use it because of the heat.

1604
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:04,000
But it is an LED light, so I'm thinking it won't be so bad.

1605
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
It shouldn't put off any heat.

1606
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
Yeah, I just need to fucking try it.

1607
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:11,000
But when I look at it, I go, oh my god, I'm not going to use that in the middle of summer.

1608
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:15,000
But I think it's an LED light, so you're right, it wouldn't put off any heat.

1609
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:19,000
Like this guy here, right next to us in the studio, this puts off heat because this is the more traditional bulb.

1610
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:23,000
Which is part of the reason why it starts to get freaking hot in here during the show.

1611
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:26,000
But I don't think the LED light would be as bad.

1612
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
Maybe I should sub this out for the LED light.

1613
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
It would be cooler in here doing all our...

1614
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Anyway.

1615
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:34,000
Yeah, as 2100matt points out, Travis has a green screen on his show for a while.

1616
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
He got it to work well.

1617
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:40,000
Yes, when I did my stream the other night and I was using the green screen, I did space.

1618
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
Just like Travis used to do.

1619
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:45,000
So, you know, a little homage I suppose. There you go.

1620
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:48,000
Alright, moving on. We've got to get to some more video game news.

1621
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Let's do some rapid fire news. Loki.

1622
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:57,000
So this was surprising because I sort of remembered this was a thing that they were teasing last year or something.

1623
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:06,000
The Tomorrow Children, which is a game that was one of those strange games that they had during an E3 trailer reel that they were doing.

1624
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:14,000
And I guess it did actually come out back in September and is now being shut down November 1st.

1625
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:17,000
Because apparently it's not very popular. But that was pretty quick.

1626
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:18,000
Only 10 months.

1627
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:23,000
Well, it's 10 months and they've already announced that it's shutting down.

1628
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:26,000
So I guess it will be out for about 14 months.

1629
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:30,000
Wow. That's quick.

1630
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:33,000
And then of course, you know, this is kind of cool.

1631
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:38,000
I did play a little bit of this on PC, but Thimbleweed Park is headed to Switch.

1632
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:47,000
So that's Ron Gilbert's new game. If you're a fan of, like, Maniac Mansion or, say, the Monkey Island series, you'll love this game.

1633
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:52,000
So that's going to be coming out on Switch soon. Right now it's currently out on PC and Xbox One.

1634
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:59,000
This is a game I've heard a lot about, but I just haven't really gotten around to playing yet. So I wanted to check that out.

1635
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:00,000
It's pretty good.

1636
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,000
Yeah, cool.

1637
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:09,000
So we mentioned earlier in the show the Castlevania series. We personally have not got around to watching it yet, but I know a lot of you guys have and I'm hearing a lot of good things about it.

1638
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:15,000
But here's the deal. The Castlevania series on Netflix has already been renewed for Season 2.

1639
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:21,000
So there it is. Just hours after the first four episodes went live, they renewed it for Season 2.

1640
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:25,000
So there must have been a lot of people hitting it right away or they just had a good feeling based on the buzz or whatever.

1641
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
So yeah, cool.

1642
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:35,000
Season 2 is going to double the episode count. So there will be eight episodes for Season 2 as opposed to the four we had for Episode 1.

1643
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:41,000
No word on who's going to write it and so forth, but yeah, hopefully that'll work out well and the fans will be pleased.

1644
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:48,000
And I did allude to this earlier in the show, but let me mention this about Blaster Master Zero officially.

1645
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
I think this is really rad.

1646
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
New DLC that's available in the game.

1647
01:38:52,000 --> 01:39:01,000
You know, Gunvolt and Galgun were already added as characters in the game previously and I'm so mad because I missed the free period for Galgun.

1648
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:04,000
Stupid me forgot to check the game and I missed the period.

1649
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:10,000
But I have some chances to get some other characters because they just announced two more characters.

1650
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:15,000
I think they announced this at Anime Expo, two more characters that are going to be joining the lineup for Blaster Master Zero.

1651
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:22,000
Shantae, you stay, in Blaster Master Zero, but obviously Shantae from The Pirate's Curse and all that.

1652
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:29,000
She is the character that just went live a couple days ago and then Shovel Knight is being added into Blaster Master Zero 2.

1653
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
That's awesome.

1654
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:38,000
So what's cool about it is that they bring their abilities into the Blaster Master format so it feels like you're playing a crossover game.

1655
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,000
So it's pretty rad.

1656
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:47,000
And again, the other thing I really love about the way Blaster Master Zero has been doing the DLC is that for the first two weeks, the DLC is free.

1657
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:52,000
Now granted, stupid me, I missed it, but that's my own fault on Galgun.

1658
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:56,000
But you know I grabbed Shantae the minute she went up.

1659
01:39:56,000 --> 01:40:01,000
I think it's really cool because that means if you're loyal, you already bought the game when it first came out.

1660
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:07,000
You have a chance to stock up on this DLC whereas people who come late to the party, they're going to have to buy it.

1661
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:11,000
So I think that's a really cool thing to do for the early supporters of the game.

1662
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:15,000
So props to the team behind this game.

1663
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:21,000
I'm that gif right now of, who is that, Tajari P. Henson with the cell phone going,

1664
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:24,000
You're doing great, sweetie. You're doing great, sweetie.

1665
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
That's me right now with this game.

1666
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:32,000
Alright, moving on to Dark Sakura.

1667
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Well, we brought up the Night Trap 25th Edition.

1668
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:46,000
Well, there is another, and I'm using Cody Fingers mode in it, which is a survivor feature, which is really just the regular game.

1669
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:56,000
That you have enemies running all over the place and you have to decrease their number until you save everybody.

1670
01:40:56,000 --> 01:41:02,000
It's the same thing, but at least they're trying to do things with it, so whatever.

1671
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:05,000
Isn't that supposed to be without all the other cutscenes or something like that?

1672
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:13,000
Yeah, something like that, but you're supposed to just see the proper scenes anyway when you go through all the monitors, so whatever.

1673
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:23,000
And then for Mass Effect Andromeda, the last patch that came out removed the Denuvo anti-tamper protection,

1674
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:28,000
which has already been proven to be pretty easy to break.

1675
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:33,000
There was a challenge that was put out for people to break it and they did it in a few days.

1676
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:36,000
They just found out no one wanted to steal the game.

1677
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
Stop it.

1678
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:49,000
I honestly look at that as the last sign of giving up, so I'm still angry. Anger.

1679
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:57,000
No, I already mentioned this to you last week. I had that moment last week where it finally clicked for me and I get it.

1680
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
It's frustrating.

1681
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:05,000
Alright, let's move on to happier things, like games that are coming out in stores this week.

1682
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
I know we already talked about we have a couple big ones, right, Loki?

1683
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:21,000
That's correct. This week we've got Final Fantasy XII The Zodiac Age on PlayStation 4, Fable Fortune, that's a card game based off Fable that's coming out on Xbox One and Windows PC,

1684
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:30,000
and Derelict Fleet on PC and PlayStation 4, and finally Energy Balance on the Vita. That's it.

1685
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:39,000
Traveling to Japan, briefly. Final Fantasy XII The Zodiac Age also getting a Japanese release on the PlayStation 4 this week on July 13th.

1686
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:45,000
There's another game also coming out on the PlayStation 4. It's called Hakoniwa Company Works is the name of this game.

1687
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:52,000
I'm not sure what this is. It looks like it might be a little bit Minecraft-y, but kind of anime mixed in.

1688
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:58,000
But I'm getting a very Minecraft vibe from the graphics, like maybe it's kind of building on the success of something like Dragon Quest Heroes or something.

1689
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:05,000
But that is a game that's out on the PlayStation 4 this week. Those are the two really big releases.

1690
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:13,000
Nothing really to note on the Nintendo Switch, but the 3DS, there's actually new 2DS-LL, that's what they call it in Japan.

1691
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:19,000
The black and turquoise and the white and orange, those are actually hitting Japan this week on July 13th.

1692
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:22,000
And so there are a ton of accessories that go with that as well.

1693
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:29,000
But as far as games go, you can check out Hey! Pikmin comes out in Japan this week, along with a new figure to go with that.

1694
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:39,000
There's also Ever Oasis has another entry in the game. Ever Oasis, Seirei To Tanibito no Miraje comes out this week.

1695
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:42,000
So there you go, Japanese releases. How about the UK, DarkSakura?

1696
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:52,000
A few things. We have Minecraft Story Mode Season 2 for everything. That's on the 11th, and on the 12th we have The End is Nigh for PC.

1697
01:43:52,000 --> 01:44:01,000
Alright, there it is. To answer this question in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Kasan in chat says,

1698
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:09,000
So is Final Fantasy XII a remake? Pretty much, but it's not the international version.

1699
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:14,000
Because they gave it a different name, because they went in and tweaked some stuff with the game.

1700
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:21,000
So it's like, you're getting the final edition of the game that had come out in Japan before, but it never came out here before.

1701
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:25,000
And what they had tweaked with it is that they kind of redid the job system.

1702
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:33,000
Like in Final Fantasy XII you have job boards, and so my understanding is that in the Zodiac Age, you can kind of pick,

1703
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:38,000
I think in this one you get to do two different jobs at once. I think originally it was one, now it's two.

1704
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:45,000
But it's like you're a little more limited in how you kind of craft your characters once you pick what job types you want them to be.

1705
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:51,000
But that also ensures that you don't fuck them up. So it's kind of a double-edged thing there.

1706
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:58,000
So it's a little bit, I guess you could say it's like the definitive version of the game of sorts.

1707
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:06,000
Because yes, they're also going back and doing the little tweaks here and there similar to what they did with Final Fantasy X to put this on the Playstation 4.

1708
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:12,000
Alright, anyhow, let's get to the mailbag. Every week you guys send us emails.

1709
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:18,000
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com and we read your emails here live on the show.

1710
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:22,000
And yet again, I don't have the damn music to put in the background here.

1711
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:30,000
So, oh wait, I found it. I found the song. We finally return to the regular mailbag music.

1712
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
Yay!

1713
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:38,000
Dark Sakura, dive in head first and find the email at participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

1714
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1715
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:41,000
Just one.

1716
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:46,000
Hey guys and gal, just wanted to respond to your topic from last week. I love my trophies.

1717
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:47,000
Good.

1718
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:51,000
I take great pride in my trophies and my trophy count and my 10 platinums.

1719
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:57,000
Yeah, I could have gotten more but there are so many games to play. I don't buy a game and say, yes, I'm a platinum this one.

1720
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:04,000
For me, it's a show of accomplishment. I could have several friends on PSN that have the same game and maybe they'll have trophies that I don't.

1721
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:10,000
I'll investigate to see if it's obtainable and I think that hunting and gathering is more important than the count.

1722
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:13,000
Dude, you got that trophy? I've been working on that bitch for a minute.

1723
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:20,000
Seeing that someone loved the game so much that they felt compelled to acquire all the trophies isn't always a display of ego fapping.

1724
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:26,000
It's a challenge. Hey, we both have the same game. I got this trophy. Can you? It also extends to the gameplay.

1725
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:33,000
I can beat a game in no time but to get all the trophies and earn a platinum means that this was one of the best ever.

1726
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:38,000
Some games, like The Walking Dead, will dish out a plat just for completing it.

1727
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:43,000
Most games will pit you against severe challenges or even optional bosses.

1728
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:48,000
I personally won't add someone to my friends list with less than 900 trophies.

1729
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:56,000
It's not an ego thing. It's just saying that I take my gaming very seriously and expect that the friends on my console of choice do the same.

1730
01:46:56,000 --> 01:47:03,000
And I won't buy a game without trophies anymore. I spent $230 in the last few weeks on PSN because of their incredible sales.

1731
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:09,000
I didn't buy a single game to earn trophies and I won't buy one without any. That is all.

1732
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:15,000
Some people like to beat games on the hardest difficulty just for the street cred. With trophies, I have receipts with dates and times.

1733
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
Thank you for the great show, Recimo.

1734
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:28,000
Okay, that's good. I'm glad that you like doing it that way. It's still completely inconsequential to me. I don't think the trophies are at all important.

1735
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:42,000
Yeah, I respect this guy's ego and I get the whole, like, when achievements are hard to get, they can really be signs of dedication to the game or whatever.

1736
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:48,000
Like, you know, I did work at getting the platinum trophy on Diablo 3 and that was a big accomplishment for me.

1737
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:53,000
And why did I do it? Because I liked the game enough and it was a goal for me to go after. Cool!

1738
01:47:53,000 --> 01:48:02,000
The thing for me is that it's so arbitrary. I'd rather have some kind of big reward for it. Other than that, I'm just doing it because I want to do it.

1739
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:11,000
Right. And I seem to remember you did bring up the World of Warcraft you kind of liked because you got mounts and shit for doing things.

1740
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:21,000
Yeah, it's like sometimes I would do things like if I was bored, like, supremely bored. But I more play the game for the enjoyment of the game.

1741
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:33,000
I'm not... I'm competitive when it counts to be competitive. And when I am playing something that is for fun, unless it's a versus game, I'm not in any sort of competition.

1742
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:42,000
I don't need to look at what other people have accomplished to gain a self... a feeling of enjoyment of it.

1743
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:49,000
I don't have to look at, oh, well, this person's done this well. I have to do the same. That's not important to me.

1744
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:50,000
Right.

1745
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:58,000
I... my enjoyment of a game has nothing to do with what other people think of it. Or what other people have done in it. You know.

1746
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:07,000
I would have been curious though, you know, because remember this whole conversation started last week because we had that game on the... maybe I missed it in the email, but I don't think I heard it.

1747
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:13,000
We had that game on the marketplace last week that was like, what, it was the 99 cent slide puzzle game that was like...

1748
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:14,000
Yeah.

1749
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:26,000
You get a trophy for pressing X and that whole thing. Like, that's kind of the thing. Remember, because that kind of started the whole conversation was, do trophies mean that much to you that you're going to pay 99 cents to just get trophies?

1750
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:35,000
And I don't get that sense from this email, but don't forget that was also kind of part of what started that whole discussion was like, are trophies like that important where it's like you will pay to get them?

1751
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:48,000
And I think we all kind of agree that was a little ridiculous. But I'm curious, would this guy have paid a dollar to get those trophies? I'm thinking no based on the email because there's no challenge. There's no reward there.

1752
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:58,000
The thing that stuck out to me, and I'm really trying not to be my usual judgmental bitchy self over this, but picking your friends based on their accomplishments.

1753
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:12,000
I'm a little worried about that too. That part kind of struck me as, ooh, now maybe if it's like randos on PlayStation 4 and you know if you want to add them or not, I get that. But like, what if it's somebody you know in real life?

1754
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:24,000
Like, I'm not sure. Like, I'm kind of just hoping I'm misunderstanding that. Like, would you really like not, would you not put me on your friends list because I don't have 200 trophies? Well, I think I do, but...

1755
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:29,000
I'm sure I've got, I don't even care how many I have. I could look.

1756
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:38,000
After all this time, I'm sure I have plenty of trophies. But let me, let me challenge this. I don't want to belabor this point too much, but let me challenge this.

1757
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:47,000
What if you had a friend who couldn't afford a PlayStation until just now? So they haven't had the time to build up those trophies.

1758
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:54,000
But they want to team up with you so they can try to get some. Because there are a lot of trophies for cooperative stuff.

1759
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:59,000
I kind of don't think this guy would turn their back on that, but I don't know.

1760
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:02,000
You're not my friend anymore. You should have been on board with the...

1761
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:14,000
I don't want to put words in dude's mouth either, but I just, you know, when I read that or when I saw that or heard that part of the email, I was a little bit like, ooh, but aren't there exceptions to every rule?

1762
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:23,000
Well, it's just, I don't believe that there should be a condition like that unless it is like for random people.

1763
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:32,000
But if it's the people that you know, you know, I would think that the point of being friends with them is to be friends with them and to play and enjoy games and talk to them.

1764
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:45,000
I really, I hate this whole expectation that these achievements have had. It's a participation award. I mean, yeah, you can participate harder, I guess, and get new ones.

1765
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:55,000
But I respect people who enjoy it. More power to you. But don't let that be the only reason for enjoying a game.

1766
01:51:55,000 --> 01:52:06,000
Yeah. And this, just to be fair to all angles, because that's what I try to do here on this show where every gamer has a voice, to be fair to this guy's angle and going back to World of Warcraft for a minute.

1767
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:20,000
I used to see this all the time in World of Warcraft where it was, we are going to do a farming run of X boss, but you need to link me your achievement to prove that you've done it because this isn't a learning group type of thing.

1768
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:33,000
I've seen that before. And so maybe if that's kind of like the approach here is that like, I don't want to play ranked matches in Overwatch with you unless you've kind of proven you've gotten certain landmarks in that game.

1769
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:45,000
Like to that end, that's not unheard of. That isn't how I choose to do MMOs. I like to do learning stuff and all that, but that's cool if that's what you want to do.

1770
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:51,000
I'm certainly not going to tell you how to play your stinking games. So, all right. Good email. Good discussion.

1771
01:52:51,000 --> 01:53:03,000
JD in chat over at live.vognetware.com says, that must be why I love achievements. It's because I'm a millennial and I want my participation trophies. But he puts a little sarcastic face after that. He's not serious.

1772
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
I want avocado toast.

1773
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:17,000
Don't you? Sounds amazing. Actually, do you want to hear like the moment when it's like, am I really from California? I don't really care for avocados.

1774
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
I just like avocados.

1775
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:22,000
I like avocados and I'm not from California.

1776
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:37,000
Is it one of those things like In-N-Out where the people not from here like it way more than the people who live here do? Although In-N-Out's not bad, but it's just, I'm always blown away how like anybody from out of the area is like, we have to go to In-N-Out. Oh my God.

1777
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:43,000
But then again, I used to be the exact same way about Dunkin Donuts until we finally got one here. So who am I to fucking talk, right?

1778
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
Yeah, maybe donuts are kind of eh.

1779
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:55,000
But I will say this. I don't hate, I don't have the raging hatred for avocado because I certainly don't dislike it. Like that's mayonnaise. Mayonnaise I fucking hate. Do not get that shit anywhere near me.

1780
01:53:55,000 --> 01:54:01,000
But like a California roll has avocado in it. I'll eat that. That's fine. I don't care.

1781
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:04,000
So what's your opinion on Miracle Whip then?

1782
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:10,000
Straight from the seventh circle of hell and the innards of Satan's butthole.

1783
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
But it's not mayonnaise really.

1784
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:15,000
But it's worse. It's imitation mayonnaise.

1785
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:19,000
It's salad dressing and not even good.

1786
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:27,000
I will say this. I only eat one brand of mayonnaise if it's not handmade. Just saying.

1787
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:31,000
Oh yeah. I've heard of that too. Like there's like certain brands that people only have.

1788
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:38,000
I grew up on Hellmann's, which out here is best foods. And I've had like the olive oil one and it's okay.

1789
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:42,000
But if it's not made by hand then it has to be that one brand.

1790
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:47,000
But isn't that weird? You can still get Hellmann's at Target even though it's all best foods here.

1791
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
Well yeah you can get it at a grocery outlet too.

1792
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:50,000
It's weird.

1793
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:56,000
Actually when I see a Hellmann's one I have to buy it because it's that little bit of homesickness you know.

1794
01:54:56,000 --> 01:55:01,000
And to be clear since now I've got everybody in chat talking about donuts. It's the coffee.

1795
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:05,000
It was never about the donuts. Like don't get me wrong. I can't pass up one of those filled donuts.

1796
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:12,000
But usually like here in California where Dunkin' is not nearly as prolific. We have like two in the entire Sacramento area.

1797
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:16,000
It's the Ma and Pa donut shops are like everywhere and they're great.

1798
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:22,000
Yeah the Dunkin' Donuts that's nearby to me. They're dead all the time.

1799
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:23,000
Oh really?

1800
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:24,000
I want one now.

1801
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:32,000
Alright. Moving on. And then in chat. Crazy Chocobonator hands Rob Roberts a mayo and miracle whip sandwich.

1802
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:39,000
If you want to wear that sandwich then that would be a smart thing to do. But if you don't I would advise against that.

1803
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:44,000
Like I always have friends that are like oh I'm going to get you a jar of mayonnaise for birthday as a joke.

1804
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:49,000
I'm like okay first of all jokes are funny. Second of all do you want to wear that?

1805
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:54,000
Like I fucking hate mayonnaise. It is gross.

1806
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
I also like Kewpie mayonnaise.

1807
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:57,000
Really?

1808
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:58,000
The Japanese one.

1809
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
But I like it for a topping on things.

1810
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:05,000
And oh my god. Here's my biggest pet peeve. I went into a restaurant once. I'm like does this have mayonnaise on it?

1811
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:08,000
And they're like no it's a garlic aioli. And I'm like that's fucking mayonnaise.

1812
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:13,000
I know your fucking code languages to make basic ingredients sound fancy.

1813
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:16,000
Anyway.

1814
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:19,000
Garlic mayolis.

1815
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:24,000
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says I actually don't get mayo on my stuff when I'm around Rob.

1816
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:29,000
I don't care. Other people can have it on a sandwich or whatever you want to do.

1817
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:33,000
Alan likes it. He fucking makes me watch him buy it at the store.

1818
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:39,000
But love makes you do crazy things so I allow him to buy the mayonnaise.

1819
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:42,000
I just say put it in the little part in the fridge where I don't have to look at it.

1820
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:43,000
Alright.

1821
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:48,000
Let's move on. It's a video game show. Not a what food do I hate show. Loki.

1822
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:54,000
So there's a game that's called Intelligent Design and Evolutionary Sandbox.

1823
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:59,000
And apparently there's still one achievement that no one has been able to crack yet.

1824
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:04,000
That one trophy. So the final Steam achievement is called Code Breaker.

1825
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:12,000
And what Code Breaker is it's basically a code that they have to solve in order to get this last achievement.

1826
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:15,000
And if they get the last achievement what do they get as a reward?

1827
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:20,000
Not just the trophy but they get the source code released for the game.

1828
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:25,000
So the game itself is more of like kind of designing your own ecosystem on a barren planet.

1829
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:31,000
And what the creator said is now the source code is not going to necessarily allow them to,

1830
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:35,000
you know, it won't answer all the questions on how to build the perfect ecosystem.

1831
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:42,000
But it will give them something else to explore which is what my game is all about.

1832
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:50,000
And so, you know, basically kind of hinting at, you know, here's how you might be able to get some tips to make it better.

1833
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:51,000
I don't know.

1834
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:54,000
But I think it's kind of neat though that they're offering up the source code.

1835
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
But yeah, no one's really figured it out yet.

1836
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:59,000
There's little bits of hints coming through different parts of the game.

1837
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:08,000
So they have like these kind of like wormhole portal things that are kind of spitting out some characters that are part of this.

1838
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
But no one's seen the crack yet.

1839
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:12,000
It's neat.

1840
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:16,000
Good way to kind of get that viral buzz on the game, I guess.

1841
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:19,000
Especially when sometimes it's hard to be noticed on Steam.

1842
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
Like this might be a good way to do it.

1843
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:26,000
I mean, it's probably not incentive for you, Loki, because you're not playing this game.

1844
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:29,000
But do you kind of get where people might find incentive in that?

1845
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:30,000
Yeah, I mean, definitely.

1846
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:38,000
I mean, there was like I remember the whole Chiliad stuff with Grand Theft Auto that people were kind of searching for Easter eggs with that and all sorts of cryptography stuff with that.

1847
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:47,000
And then come to find out there's really nothing there and their Easter egg mission that they have now is kind of crap.

1848
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:50,000
Which, by the way, they finally figured out how to actually unlock that mission.

1849
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:57,000
So you have to do 600 gun running missions and then you trigger a gun running mission at night.

1850
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:01,000
And if you do it at the right time, you get that Easter egg one.

1851
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
But that's kind of lame.

1852
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000
It's not a jet pack.

1853
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:09,000
Alright, well let's talk about Rayman.

1854
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
But not a new Rayman game.

1855
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
An old Rayman game.

1856
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:14,000
A very old Rayman game.

1857
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:20,000
There was actually a Rayman Super Nintendo version that was under development and there was even a prototype demo.

1858
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:24,000
That was put online by a developer at Lizardcube.

1859
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:27,000
And you can actually download this.

1860
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:28,000
So it was pretty cool.

1861
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
Twitter user Oakornut.

1862
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:31,000
I hope I said that right.

1863
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:33,000
Actually put that up.

1864
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:37,000
He's the developer at Lizardcube that put that up on Dropbox and you can check that out.

1865
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:41,000
Because, you know, this is years old and it's not like anybody's going to lose money off this.

1866
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:42,000
So there you go.

1867
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:47,000
Previously there were images on Twitter posted when the prototype was found to still be working.

1868
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
So if you want to check that out, you can.

1869
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:53,000
Although keep in mind because it is a prototype, it's not going to be perfect.

1870
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:56,000
If it was perfect, they would have released the damn thing.

1871
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:57,000
But they didn't.

1872
01:59:57,000 --> 02:00:00,000
JD in chat says, Rayman for Super Nintendo Mini.

1873
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:02,000
Wouldn't that be something?

1874
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:07,000
But I guess one unfinished game that they actually went back and finished still blows my mind.

1875
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:08,000
I guess that's enough.

1876
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:10,000
Alright, moving on.

1877
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:11,000
Dark Sakura.

1878
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:21,000
Well, there is a book coming out that is honoring a phenomenon that we don't really see so much anymore.

1879
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:28,000
But it's the bad video game translation book.

1880
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:34,000
It's called This Be Book Bad Translation Video Games.

1881
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:35,000
That's awesome.

1882
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:41,000
And like one of the pictures in there is like, you are a sucking baby.

1883
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:49,000
And of course we're going to have, you know, probably the all your base and all that.

1884
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,000
But it feels like it's inspired by that.

1885
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
Here is a graveyard of you.

1886
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:59,000
So I don't know. I kind of have to have this book now.

1887
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:05,000
Yeah, I was looking at some of the little screenshots that, you know, the demo pages they have out there.

1888
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:06,000
It looks pretty funny.

1889
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:07,000
Apparently it's $15.

1890
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:10,000
That's a fun little coffee table book for a nerd.

1891
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:12,000
I like it.

1892
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:15,000
I think it would be fun. Yeah, I might have to pick this up.

1893
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

1894
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:19,000
I'll link it in the chat room.

1895
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:23,000
Kasa Ninchat says, please tell me they have Harvest Moon screenshots.

1896
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:26,000
I'm sure any of the legendary stuff is in there.

1897
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:30,000
S2100 Matt says, all your base are belong to us has to be in it.

1898
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
Oh yeah, that's one of the big pictures.

1899
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:35,000
All right.

1900
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
Moving on, just a couple more stories for you guys.

1901
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:39,000
Then we're going to open up the Skype line.

1902
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:40,000
See if you guys have anything to say.

1903
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:43,000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

1904
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:44,000
But first, Loki.

1905
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:51,000
All right, so this is a pretty cool follow up to something we had talked about just a few weeks ago.

1906
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:59,000
So remember the whole thing with Rockstar Games kind of banning modding tools for the single player and stuff like that?

1907
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:00,000
I do.

1908
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:01,000
I do.

1909
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:02,000
With Open 4?

1910
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:03,000
Well, Open 4 is back.

1911
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:05,000
So they re-enabled the downloads on it.

1912
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:09,000
They did put out a release talking about, you know, kind of what's going on.

1913
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:25,000
The only thing that isn't going to be released though is the fact that they were working on that kind of total conversion where they were adding the Liberty City map into the Grand Theft Auto 5 map.

1914
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:33,000
And of course because that does violate their modding policy now, that unfortunately is not something that they're going to be continuing forward with.

1915
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
But the development of Open 4 will continue though.

1916
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:38,000
So that is good to finally get this whole thing resolved.

1917
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
So we've kind of met halfway I guess.

1918
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:41,000
Yes.

1919
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:42,000
Which is fine.

1920
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:43,000
All right.

1921
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
How about Grand Theft Auto 6?

1922
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
Is it time to start talking Grand Theft Auto 6?

1923
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:48,000
Not yet, probably.

1924
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:49,000
No?

1925
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
I guess we've got to get past Red Dead Redemption 2 first, huh?

1926
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
Before we can talk about that.

1927
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:54,000
All right.

1928
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:59,000
Well, one more story for you guys tonight, our last official story tonight before we get to the Skype line.

1929
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:05,000
There is a brand new rhythm and dance arcade game being released by Konami.

1930
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:06,000
That's right.

1931
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:12,000
Apparently is being location tested or demoed at a round one in Senashime.

1932
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
I hope I said that right.

1933
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:23,000
That is apparently also a location where a lot of dance evolution players, which was, what was that Kinect game that came out that was Konami.

1934
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
It's almost just like that in the arcade.

1935
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
Somebody in the chat will remember.

1936
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:30,000
But anyway, Stepstar is the new game.

1937
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:36,000
And Stepstar is, it's interesting because the dance pad is like just one big mat.

1938
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
It's almost like one big kind of pad on the ground.

1939
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
It's not split up like DDR was.

1940
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:43,000
But in this game, there are four types of notes or steps.

1941
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:48,000
There's step, long, jump, and crouch squat down.

1942
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:54,000
Because I guess this measures you not just by the dance pad but also by a camera that is watching you.

1943
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
Thank you MXC Dance Masters.

1944
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:57,000
I think that was it.

1945
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
That is the name of that game I was thinking of.

1946
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:04,000
Anyway, the interesting thing about this game though, it's not a Bamani title.

1947
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:07,000
The Bamani logo is not on the flyers.

1948
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
It's not showing up on the cabinet either.

1949
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:12,000
So apparently, even though it's a dance game, it's not a Bamani game.

1950
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:17,000
So after all these years everybody, confirmed, Bamani is dead.

1951
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
Thank you, goodnight.

1952
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:22,000
Alright, I'm just teasing.

1953
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
Put down your pitchforks and torches.

1954
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
Alright, but anyway.

1955
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:27,000
I just sighed, that's all.

1956
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:35,000
Part of what I think is interesting about this game is that you can actually, I guess the game will actually make a YouTube for you.

1957
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:41,000
So you can automatically upload it to YouTube because social sharing is the big thing we do now, right?

1958
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:49,000
So the gameplay is recorded and then you can upload it to YouTube via the game's website and a four digit pin that you use.

1959
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:53,000
And just so you get a sense of what the songs in the game sound like, you have these guys.

1960
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:58,000
This is a cute song.

1961
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:02,000
It sounds a little like something out of Hatsune Miku, but I like it.

1962
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:06,000
These guys are getting into it too.

1963
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:11,000
Alright, anyway, this makes for horrible radio, but that's one of the songs there is in Stepstar on the location test.

1964
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,000
So there you go.

1965
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:17,000
You can check that out if you live in Japan, otherwise you'll have to wait.

1966
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:25,000
But the good news is if it's being tested at a round one, maybe it'll make the round ones over here for those of you guys that happen to live near one.

1967
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:28,000
Which it seems like there are more and more of those round ones popping up.

1968
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:32,000
So that hopefully will be good news for you music game fans.

1969
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:35,000
But not Bimani fans because remember, this isn't a Bimani game.

1970
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:36,000
Alright.

1971
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:37,000
Bimani is dead.

1972
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,000
Long live Bimani.

1973
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:42,000
Alright, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

1974
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:46,000
If you want to give us a call, the Skype line is open now.

1975
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:50,000
And while we wait for some calls, Loki, I want to check in and see if you have any last minute stories.

1976
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:55,000
Well, one thing we didn't talk about this week, which is it's drama, unfortunately.

1977
02:05:55,000 --> 02:06:02,000
So there is this whole controversy going on around this woman named Alex Mauer.

1978
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:07,000
And she was someone that worked on a game called Star Maser.

1979
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:14,000
And she's been DMCA copyright claiming a bunch of videos that have Star Maser music in them because...

1980
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:18,000
This has been going on for a couple of weeks. Somebody tweeted this at me.

1981
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:21,000
Because you know we had those Star Maser guys on the show a while ago.

1982
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:22,000
So anyway, sorry.

1983
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
But yeah, this has been going on for a few weeks now.

1984
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
But go ahead. I don't want to cut you off.

1985
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:30,000
Anyways, so basically there's a whole...

1986
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:37,000
Lawsuit is being filed against her now because she was a contractor and they had it in their contract.

1987
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:41,000
I mean, as it is when you're doing contract work, anything you produce in that contract,

1988
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:47,000
unless it's specifically stated there, is whoever you're working for, that's their copyright.

1989
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:50,000
So you don't own that anymore. But she feels that she does.

1990
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
And so she's claiming against them.

1991
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:59,000
And now even other companies like Adult Swim Games, Turner Broadcasting, she filed a claim against them.

1992
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:03,000
Like all sorts of crazy shit. And it's just not going to work out too well for her.

1993
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:10,000
Here's the thing. This is a really tricky issue and it's one that I don't want to really stick my nose in too far.

1994
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:18,000
But I also kind of get, like it sounds like the StarMazer team kind of did a spinoff or like a side game that was...

1995
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:22,000
And I forget the name of it or whatever, but apparently some of this stuff was used there too.

1996
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:23,000
And so that's...

1997
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,000
No, it wasn't even that because...

1998
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:26,000
That's what it was.

1999
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:30,000
No, it's a bunch of stuff. And she felt that she was due some money regarding this.

2000
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:33,000
But she doesn't have the rights to this stuff.

2001
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:37,000
And now thankfully a lot of the videos are coming back from their claim status on there.

2002
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:40,000
Like I said, there is a lawsuit now being filed against her.

2003
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:47,000
She's filed death threats, or she's made death threats against people, sent emails, threatened to kill herself.

2004
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:53,000
It's just a big, huge mess. It's just... it's bad.

2005
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:55,000
But hopefully...

2006
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:57,000
They thought that she was getting the help that she needed.

2007
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,000
I hope that she gets some guidance with that.

2008
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,000
But she's just kind of doubling down.

2009
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:05,000
Going after the users, there's not going to... like the YouTubers and stuff, there's not...

2010
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:07,000
If she has an issue with Starbazer, I'm not going to...

2011
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:08,000
Well, it wasn't even because...

2012
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:11,000
I don't know if she... I don't know all sides of the story.

2013
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
So again, I'm not going to try to stick my nose in it.

2014
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
But if she has a legitimate claim against her...

2015
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:19,000
Because at face value, if she was told this is going to be for one game,

2016
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
and then all of a sudden now it's two games,

2017
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:24,000
I can sort of see where there is concern.

2018
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:27,000
But that's between her and those guys,

2019
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
and they need to work it out with their lives and all this stuff.

2020
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:32,000
Dragging all these other fucking people on YouTube and stuff, no winners there.

2021
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:35,000
The whole reason she was doing that is because she was trying to get, you know,

2022
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:40,000
basically taking it on the YouTubers so that the company gets attention from it.

2023
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
You know, like the YouTubers are supposed to get mad.

2024
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:45,000
Well that backfired spectacularly on her, didn't it?

2025
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:46,000
It was ridiculous.

2026
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:52,000
But at the same time, the psychological stuff that can come with that can really...

2027
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
Like the Internet's a fucking savage place sometimes.

2028
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
Right, and then she basically doesn't own this music,

2029
02:08:56,000 --> 02:09:01,000
and she's literally sometimes claiming three... making three claims against a channel.

2030
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
That knocks a channel. That's bi. Your channel's gone.

2031
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,000
Yeah, at that point.

2032
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:08,000
But this is also something where, again, I blame YouTube.

2033
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:14,000
This is also on YouTube for not being content creator friendly.

2034
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:18,000
Yet, it continues to be one of the only options out there.

2035
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
Anyway, this issue's a fucking mess.

2036
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
That's all I have to say.

2037
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
Dungeon Buster's been educated on this issue,

2038
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:27,000
so I just want to read this in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

2039
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:28,000
Dungeon Buster says,

2040
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:29,000
Dungeon Buster says,

2041
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,000
Star Maser the game is still being made,

2042
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:33,000
but there's a spin-off game called Star Maser DSP.

2043
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:34,000
That was it.

2044
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
That some backers are upset about because they're asking,

2045
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
why are they working on that instead of the main game?

2046
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:42,000
The devs have also been bad at communicating updates to the main project.

2047
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
The last huge update was last November.

2048
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:47,000
And then, you know, I have to admit,

2049
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:51,000
I really get irked at some of these stories

2050
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:54,000
because then I go, well, you know, we had them on our show,

2051
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
and we backed the project and all that stuff,

2052
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:59,000
so I really, I'm rooting for them, and I want to see them succeed,

2053
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:02,000
but it also kind of doesn't look great on us

2054
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
when we brought on these projects and hyped them up,

2055
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:05,000
and they're not...

2056
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:06,000
But how are we supposed to know?

2057
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:07,000
Yeah, we don't.

2058
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:09,000
But it, unfortunately, it also,

2059
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:11,000
it just makes me leery of Kickstarters in the future.

2060
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:12,000
You know what I mean?

2061
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:13,000
Yeah.

2062
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:15,000
So it's kind of, I don't know.

2063
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:16,000
Anyway, just throwing that out there.

2064
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:19,000
Anyway, if anyone from that team happens to be listening,

2065
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,000
or if this composer happens to be listening,

2066
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:24,000
open door, if y'all want to come on the show and talk about it.

2067
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:25,000
Open door.

2068
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:26,000
Every gamer gets a voice.

2069
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
So, all right.

2070
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:29,000
Yeah, and Dutch Ambassador says it's not your fault.

2071
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:30,000
There's no way to tell.

2072
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
No, I know that, but at the same time.

2073
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:33,000
At the same time, you know.

2074
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,000
All right, let's go to the phones.

2075
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:36,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2076
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:37,000
Who's this?

2077
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:39,000
Hey, this is Raging Nader.

2078
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:40,000
Hey, Raging Nader.

2079
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:41,000
What's on your mind, buddy?

2080
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:43,000
Not a whole lot.

2081
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:50,000
This call is semi-related to the email that I sent in last week.

2082
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:51,000
Wait a minute.

2083
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:53,000
I have to ask a question because you're on video on Skype,

2084
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:54,000
and I know this isn't great radio,

2085
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:57,000
but are we being projected on a screen behind you?

2086
02:10:57,000 --> 02:11:00,000
Is that like your computer on a projector?

2087
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
Yeah, yeah.

2088
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:05,000
But you watch a lot of movies on Steam and all that stuff,

2089
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:07,000
so that makes sense.

2090
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,000
You might have a projector set up for that.

2091
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:13,000
Yeah, well, I play a lot of my DVDs and whatnot,

2092
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:18,000
and my projector, and my iTunes content, so on and so forth, so.

2093
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:19,000
All right.

2094
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:20,000
Sorry, I had to be nosy and ask,

2095
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
but you said you had to follow up to last week's email.

2096
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:23,000
Yeah.

2097
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:27,000
Now, just to refresh everyone's memory,

2098
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:32,000
one thing I brought up was the Super Nintendo Mini,

2099
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:35,000
or whatever the official name is,

2100
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:44,000
and I gave an anecdote as to my buying the Super Nintendo way back in the day,

2101
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:48,000
so on and so forth, and on that note,

2102
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:51,000
I want to ask you two related questions.

2103
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:58,000
Now, whenever the three of you bought your systems,

2104
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
especially way back in the day,

2105
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:05,000
with your limited funds through babysitting or paper routes or whatever,

2106
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:09,000
and considering how expensive some of the games could be,

2107
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:12,000
especially for 20 years ago or plus,

2108
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:22,000
what kind of, for lack of a better term, research did the three of you do,

2109
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:29,000
especially considering that they really have the internet as we know it today?

2110
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:30,000
Okay.

2111
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:31,000
I like this question.

2112
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:35,000
So, 20 years ago, what influenced your game buying decisions,

2113
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:39,000
because there was no internet, there was no Metacritic.

2114
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:42,000
What was it 20 years ago?

2115
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:45,000
Well, I'd subscribe to magazines and see what looks nice,

2116
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:49,000
and then, of course, 20 years ago, we had the whole video and game rental scene,

2117
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:51,000
so we didn't have to make a purchase.

2118
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:53,000
You could just rent it and see if it's something you like,

2119
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:55,000
or play it at a friend's house.

2120
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:56,000
Jamie?

2121
02:12:56,000 --> 02:13:00,000
It was, oh, I like this in the arcade.

2122
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:01,000
Oh, it's coming out.

2123
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:04,000
When it was Street Fighter II and Mortal Kombat?

2124
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:05,000
Absolutely.

2125
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:07,000
Well, and pretty much all I played was RPG and fighting games,

2126
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:10,000
and lots and lots and lots of Kirby's Avalanche.

2127
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:14,000
Yeah, I would say it's kind of like half what Loki said

2128
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:20,000
and half like magazines like GamePro, EGM, and all that.

2129
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:23,000
That was kind of what we had instead of the internet then,

2130
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:25,000
so that was definitely what went into it.

2131
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:26,000
Yeah.

2132
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:34,000
At least for me, it's a lot of what you're saying, in my case.

2133
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:39,000
I read, for a number of years, I did read Nintendo Power,

2134
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:45,000
but I kind of put that, by the way, because I kind of figured,

2135
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:48,000
hey, this magazine is put up on Nintendo themselves.

2136
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:51,000
This magazine is basically over-glorified ads.

2137
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:55,000
Obviously, they're not going to say, hey, our games suck.

2138
02:13:55,000 --> 02:14:01,000
So I started reading other magazines like GamePro, like you mentioned, and whatnot.

2139
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:05,000
Then on top of that, I don't know if you remember,

2140
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:12,000
there was a GamePro TV that had a brief run on there.

2141
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
I saw the VOs on there.

2142
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:18,000
That's how I discovered Castlevania IV.

2143
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:26,000
And then, of course, some other kids in the neighborhood had such-and-such games on such-and-such systems.

2144
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
That's how I checked it out.

2145
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:33,000
And that's how I beat a lot of my decisions.

2146
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:39,000
Yeah. A lot of times, TV footage and video stuff, like what little did get to TV,

2147
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:43,000
was huge influencers on the decision, for sure.

2148
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:44,000
Yeah.

2149
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:51,000
As for my second question, which kind of relates to my previous question,

2150
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:59,000
for the longest time, I personally can say that I was a diehard Nintendo fanboy.

2151
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:05,000
You know, I had the original Nintendo, the Super Nintendo,

2152
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:11,000
and I even got the N64 in the spring of 1997.

2153
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:19,000
And right around the time that I was going to my local Toys R Us to buy the N64,

2154
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:27,000
I saw the PlayStation 1 at a demo kiosk with one of those jam packs that they had.

2155
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:34,000
Now, I honestly, at the time when Nintendo Fanboy was a little conflicted,

2156
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:37,000
because on one hand, I said to myself,

2157
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:42,000
wow, these games out there on the jam pack look awesome.

2158
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:48,000
I want to play them, you know, but at the same time as being a Nintendo fanboy,

2159
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:53,000
I felt almost like, you know, for lack of a better term, traitorous.

2160
02:15:53,000 --> 02:16:02,000
You know, hey, oh my God, am I actually considered by a competitor's system?

2161
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:08,000
Yeah, but that's a lot of ridiculous shit that the advertising campaigns put on our head and all that stuff, you know.

2162
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:17,000
Yeah. So that being said, well, ultimately, yeah, I did get the PlayStation 1 a few weeks later,

2163
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:31,000
but all that being said, I would like to ask, have you ever had conflicting emotions about buying such a system for similar reasons?

2164
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:35,000
No, not me. I'll open this up to the co-host. No, never me.

2165
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:40,000
But it was just the reality was I didn't, you know, if I had had the money, I would have bought them all.

2166
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:44,000
But I never had that kind of money, so you had to make a choice.

2167
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:51,000
And usually those choices were heavily influenced by, you know, what did my friends have and, you know, what was available in that regard.

2168
02:16:51,000 --> 02:17:00,000
But I, no, no, I really wouldn't buy stuff out of loyalty. Shit, I wish at a young age I'd been able to afford a Neo Geo.

2169
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:08,000
I remember renting a Neo Geo. You could rent the whole damn system in like a game or two for like 15 bucks for a few days.

2170
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:13,000
And I remember renting Fatal Fury Special so I could play that on Neo Geo.

2171
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:18,000
Because, yeah, oh man, that was, I was like, I was like, I had the fucking arcade in my house. It was awesome.

2172
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
We might be selling ours.

2173
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:21,000
Really?

2174
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:25,000
Yep. We haven't played it a whole lot and that'd give us a few grand.

2175
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:28,000
No, yeah, I guess so. I guess, yeah, those things are worth a lot.

2176
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
So, all right.

2177
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:31,000
Yeah.

2178
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:34,000
Rage Nator, I'm gonna let you go so we can try to squeeze some more calls, but good questions tonight. Take care, buddy.

2179
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:35,000
Sure.

2180
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:36,000
All right.

2181
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:37,000
All right, have a nice night.

2182
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:38,000
Bye.

2183
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:44,000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype. If you want to give us a call, we'll leave it open for just a couple more minutes here.

2184
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:50,000
But if you are on the fence on if you should call or not, you should probably call right now because we might close it up soon.

2185
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:54,000
Let me check in with Loki. Any other last minute stories that we have?

2186
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:58,000
No, not really.

2187
02:17:58,000 --> 02:17:59,000
Well, gee.

2188
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:00,000
All right.

2189
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
Sorry.

2190
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
What do you want? I mean.

2191
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:09,000
Yeah, I know. I know. Well, I'm just trying to buy some time. We wait for another call here.

2192
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:13,000
Any games y'all are planning to play this week?

2193
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:15,000
Fives of 12 for me.

2194
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:22,000
I'm still working on actually starting programming this game.

2195
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:26,000
But it's not for, you know, it hasn't been completely a waste of time.

2196
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:32,000
So I like I've been gathering other things. I've been trying to figure out like the storyline or whatever for the game.

2197
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:39,000
I'm going to be working on and also finding music and that they're like stylistic assets and stuff that I kind of want to base.

2198
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:45,000
You know, like kind of like I guess like a board, if you will, of like, OK, I kind of like the way this looks.

2199
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:48,000
I want to kind of use as like an inspiration board.

2200
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:53,000
There you go. And so, yeah, we just kind of do that stuff.

2201
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:55,000
What about you, Jimmy?

2202
02:18:55,000 --> 02:19:01,000
I I actually finished up writing. I was considering starting my book.

2203
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:07,000
Oh, I've been world building so much. I might just get it going. But talking shit, naming names by Jamie.

2204
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:14,000
No. But other than that, I'm I still got Ultra Despair Girls to get started on.

2205
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:18,000
And I've been enjoying Xenoverse two so much. I don't really want to play anything else.

2206
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:22,000
All right. Well, the phone lines look like they're slowing down.

2207
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:28,000
So I think that means it's time to close them up. But thank you, guys, who did call in.

2208
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:32,000
Thanks, Regenator. Thanks for the emails, of course, and all the chat comments tonight.

2209
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:37,000
If you think of something after the fact, you can always give us a shout on Twitter at OLR.

2210
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:40,000
You can leave us a comment over at VOG Network dot com or talk to us throughout the week,

2211
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:45,000
either in our IRC channel at VOG Network or on the new Discord.

2212
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:50,000
Either way would be fantastic. But I think it is that part of the show where we're going to wrap things up.

2213
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:53,000
So I want to thank you guys, as always, for listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2214
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:55,000
And if you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio,

2215
02:19:55,000 --> 02:20:01,000
please remember to leave a five star review where you found this show either on iTunes or Google Play.

2216
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:06,000
And of course, we also say tell a friend about the show. Help us spread the word where every gamer has a voice.

2217
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:11,000
We got to have all the gamer voices here to air them. So word of mouth goes a very, very, very long way.

2218
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:16,000
We always appreciate it. So I guess we will close it up tonight by getting everybody's final thoughts.

2219
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:21,000
Loki, your final thought tonight. So I was looking in chat and they were talking about the Oton.

2220
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:26,000
I haven't even figured. I didn't remember if they even launched the campaign for that,

2221
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:30,000
because I know that dude was talking about the Oton for like the longest time.

2222
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:37,000
And they were like bouncing between like Kickstarter and Indie.

2223
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:42,000
Was it IndieGoGo or whatever it was? I don't remember. But like.

2224
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:47,000
Yeah, that was a shit show. There was no way that was going to happen.

2225
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:53,000
That's it. And Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight. I wish I had a quesadilla.

2226
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:59,000
Mmm. Cheese and tortillas. I just want the cheese, really. It's the melted cheese that's the best part.

2227
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:03,000
The tortilla is just a vehicle for deliverance of said cheese.

2228
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:10,000
And that reminds me, I did see, was it that the tease video that Oton Brown's bringing good eats back, which is fantastic.

2229
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:15,000
OK. How about unwrapped with Mark Summers? That was my favorite. No.

2230
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:19,000
Yeah, I'd go for that. All right. All right.

2231
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:22,000
That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2232
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:26,000
My final thought tonight would be I want to get to my coloring book this week.

2233
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:29,000
I saw my Golden Girls coloring book. I need to get to this week. Your pencils arrived at my house.

2234
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:33,000
Yeah. I forgot to bring them. All right. That's OK. That means you have to come over.

2235
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:38,000
Well, isn't it a nice thing that I have to go drop you off anyway? So that's right.

2236
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:42,000
OK. There we go. All right. So that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2237
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:45,000
Have a great night, everybody. We'll see you next time. Bye.

2238
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:15,000
Radio or Vogue Network, but you know, they were all still true.

2239
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:18,000
See you next week.

2240
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
You
