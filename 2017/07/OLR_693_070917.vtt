00:00.000 --> 00:27.000
On the heels of celebration comes the inevitable hangover as we learn of a few cancellations, extensions of life, and a look back at what may have been. We hope you still have all your fingers, eyebrows, and all other appendages intact so they can join us right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:45.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It's Orange Lounge Radio live tonight on July 9th, 2017 with episode number 693 of our show.

00:45.000 --> 00:58.000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joined as I am every week over the last, you know, 692 episodes since it's 693 with my co-host. Say hello over there to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Oh hi.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Hi, how are you doing?

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
I'm okay.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Did you have a good 4th of July holiday?

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
I stayed inside so it was great.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Yeah.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
I had a bit of a headache and I didn't want to be around other humans.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Yeah.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
So it was great.

01:11.000 --> 01:26.000
I had a really terrible day but it got worse because somebody set off a firework at 3 in the morning and it sounded like they fired a gun. Like I seriously thought somebody got in our backyard to fire off a bottle rocket or something because it sounded like such a large explosion.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
That sucks.

01:27.000 --> 01:42.000
And I just, oh my gosh, it was so terrible. But I mean, we were able to, Alan's birthday was Friday so we got to go to Benihana. So you know, things got better but oh my gosh, I was like a zombie at work on Wednesday. It was so unfair. So unfair.

01:42.000 --> 01:49.000
So I know it's a radio show so our listeners can't see your shirt but your shirt today says Slay All Day.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
Slay All Day.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
Where did you buy, where did you get that? Did you make that?

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Target.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
Target has a shirt that says Slay All Day?

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
I also have a shirt that says Can't Adult Today.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
Target sell that too?

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Yeah.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
Wow. I had no idea that they sold such hip things.

02:06.000 --> 02:11.000
It's like a sleeveless muscle shirt but this is what I wore to Pride. This whole outfit is what I wore to Pride.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
Nice.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Including the boot.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
Including the boot which you are still rocking.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
It's split on the toe.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
How much longer are you in the boot for?

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Till the 25th.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
Okay, well I guess that's manageable.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
Which is right before California Extreme.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
Yes.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
I'm so happy.

02:26.000 --> 02:31.000
Which I am. I am still planning to do California Extreme but I'm planning myself a long week.

02:31.000 --> 02:36.000
Well I'm only going to go Saturday because I don't want to rush on Sunday because I'll be dead.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
Maybe all that we're doing is Saturday.

02:38.000 --> 02:45.000
I'm going to go to Rocky Horror in the City Saturday night and go visit my old pals on the cast over there that I used to perform with.

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
So that's my plan. So I'm going to have a very busy day on that Saturday.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
But California Extreme, I'm really excited about it.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
I haven't been in like seven or eight years.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
Really?

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
Oh, it's been a long time.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Well, GamerX was the same weekend a couple of years.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
That was unfortunate.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
And then I don't remember what came up.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
It's just, you know, trips or something always kind of held me back.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
I want to rotate my foot.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
Alright.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
I want to make sure while you stretch your foot and do what you need to do, I want to introduce Techmaster Loki.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Hello.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
How are you doing, Loki?

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
I'm fine.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
So the 4th of July, a holiday about fire.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
Surely one that you participated in?

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
No.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
No?

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
No, the fireworks here suck so I'm not going to spend any money on them.

03:23.000 --> 03:30.000
I mean, literally you can spend like one firework that they have that lasts for maybe 30 seconds is like 20 bucks.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
No thanks.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
They just get worse every year.

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
And I just didn't want to waste some of my money on it.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Yeah, the fireworks are not that great.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
But you know what else is really awful is fires.

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
So I understand why they, well, especially when people are setting off the crazy stuff anyway.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
I understand.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
They do it anyways.

03:48.000 --> 03:57.000
I don't think it would matter if they brought in the better fireworks because they bring in the better fireworks anyways.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
I know some people love their 4th of July.

03:59.000 --> 04:05.000
RideMyChocoboMan in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, I love blowing shit up.

04:05.000 --> 04:14.000
Let's see, Bobby Black Wolf, our pal who's live before us at VOG Network on Sunday night says, I stayed home on July 4th and binge watched Doctor Who.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
I figured that was the best way to celebrate Brexit 1776.

04:18.000 --> 04:25.000
Yes, I know a lot of people were into the Doctor Who because the finale of this most recent season just happened, right?

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
So I'm a little behind on a lot of my television stuff.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
If it's not on Netflix, I'm not watching it right now.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
So I'm a little behind on some of this stuff.

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
I have to rely on the other VOG Network shows to keep me on that stuff.

04:37.000 --> 04:46.000
Anyway, we are of course here to talk about video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle with you guys in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

04:46.000 --> 04:52.000
because we do tape live Sunday nights at 6 Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
So if you are listening to us live, head on into our chat room.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
But if you're listening to us on the podcast feed, hey, that's great too.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
You can always send us an email.

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
Participate at orangeonshreddy.com or you can always tweet at us at OLR.

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
You can probably send a carrier pigeon and it will probably find its way to us one way or another.

05:07.000 --> 05:12.000
We invite you to participate in many different ways including the brand new Discord

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
which a lot of you guys have been showing up to which has been awesome.

05:15.000 --> 05:20.000
So if you haven't checked out the new VOG Network Discord, be sure to head over to vognetwork.com

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
and under the participate banner is Discord.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
And I believe that's just vognetwork.com slash Discord.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
And that will get you the invite you need to get in there.

05:29.000 --> 05:35.000
And yeah, we've been using that and I already have people talking to me when they see me playing Final Fantasy XIV

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
asking if I want to party up and stuff like that so that's kind of fun.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
So yeah, check that out, our new Discord.

05:41.000 --> 05:47.000
Meanwhile, I want to get into some game chat for the night including our kickoff topic tonight.

05:47.000 --> 05:53.000
You know, it was a little bit slower of a news week with the 4th of July, a holiday happening in the middle of the week.

05:53.000 --> 05:58.000
You had a lot of people that made it a long weekend last weekend or kind of took a couple extra days off.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
So it kind of slowed the news cycle this week.

06:00.000 --> 06:05.000
But next week is going to be a pretty big release, I think, for game releases

06:05.000 --> 06:10.000
even though it is the re-release of a game that came out in 2006, I think.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
So it's well over about 11 years old at this point.

06:13.000 --> 06:18.000
Final Fantasy XII, although this time they are releasing the Zodiac Age version of the game

06:18.000 --> 06:23.000
which is similar to what they did when they did the Final Fantasy X remaster and the X-II remaster.

06:23.000 --> 06:30.000
They did a, like the international versions of those games were what we got as the release on Playstation 4.

06:30.000 --> 06:37.000
So they're doing something similar to Final Fantasy XII which is great because I remember when the Final Fantasy X stuff came out

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
I think one of the things we all said was, wouldn't it be great if they did this for XII as well

06:41.000 --> 06:47.000
because a lot of people kind of missed that game because that came out right as the Xbox 360 was taken off

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
and the PS3 was about to come out.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
So Final Fantasy XII, I think a lot of people kind of overlooked.

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
So it's great that that's coming out and people get to re-experience that again.

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
So I want to actually talk a little bit here at the top of the show about remasters.

07:00.000 --> 07:06.000
And you know, I know Final Fantasy XII is the one that's coming out this week that we all have to look forward to.

07:06.000 --> 07:13.000
But, you know, certainly we've talked a lot on previous episodes about the Switch

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
and the remasters from the Wii U that we're seeing coming out on Switch

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
especially like Mario Kart 8 which has done very, very well for them.

07:21.000 --> 07:26.000
We saw this week there were teasers. We don't know what to make of it.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
But, you know, it's kind of like people are looking into these tweets and going,

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
oh well they said 2 and 1 and 2 plus 1 is 3 so Half-Life 3 confirmed.

07:34.000 --> 07:40.000
But there was a tweet from, was it Kamiya that tweeted out or was it Platinum Games account?

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
Who tweeted?

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
I think it was the Platinum Games account.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
I think it was the Platinum Games account.

07:43.000 --> 07:48.000
Tweeted a picture of the Wonderful 101 and if you look over somebody's shoulder they're playing it on the Switch.

07:49.000 --> 07:56.000
And then there was like a Bayonetta graphic that had the Bayonetta from her look in Bayonetta 1 and Bayonetta from her look in 2.

07:56.000 --> 08:03.000
And it was like red and blue and they were kind of like on top of each other sort of like it could be a Switch.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
Like they were Switched. Get it?

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
Okay, Half-Life 3 confirmed a little bit here.

08:07.000 --> 08:13.000
But it has people talking all about those games potentially getting Switch remasters.

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
So I'm curious what you all think about, you can talk about these remasters if you want.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
But remasters in general and I open this up to our chatters as well.

08:20.000 --> 08:25.000
I don't consider those remasters, I consider them porting them to another system because they're not doing anything to them.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
They're just re-releasing them on another system.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
Second chances.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
It's not even, yeah, I mean it's like that's not a remaster.

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
A remaster would be something like, okay, this game came out on another system.

08:35.000 --> 08:42.000
Like the Halo collection or something like that where they completely redo all the graphics and the meshes and everything like that.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
Crash Bandicoot.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
Crash Bandicoot. Which is apparently doing really well.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Especially in the UK.

08:48.000 --> 08:55.000
Which doesn't, I mean that franchise was always I think particularly larger over there on that side of the pond than it was.

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
I mean it was still kind of big over here but it was really big in the UK if I remember right.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
So it's doing phenomenal over there from what I understand.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
So even to the point where, and I hope I'm not spoiling a story.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
I don't think it was one I showrolled but it was one that I was looking at.

09:08.000 --> 09:16.000
That they've even kind of commented that like they're looking at maybe doing something with Crash Bandicoot in the future because this remaster is doing so well.

09:16.000 --> 09:22.000
But it is truly a remaster and I realize we're kind of splitting Harris a little bit because you're right.

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
If you look at, let's say Bayonetta gets released on the Switch.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
Is that really a remaster or is that a port?

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
It's a second chance is what it is.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
Those games are a second chance.

09:33.000 --> 09:37.000
You know it's a port running at like 1080p or something like that when...

09:37.000 --> 09:42.000
Yeah, yeah. The PC one, like I bought Bayonetta on PC.

09:42.000 --> 09:51.000
It's not really a remaster but it runs better than it does on the original Playstation 3 and so forth.

09:51.000 --> 09:56.000
So, ok it's not a remaster but it's still a modernized version if you will.

09:56.000 --> 10:01.000
And I would assume that even if they do end up doing the Bayonetta 1 and 2 thing on the Switch.

10:01.000 --> 10:06.000
They'll probably throw something extra in there to sweeten the pot just because there are going to be...

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Amiibo support, always fucking Amiibo support.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Oh yeah, good call, Amiibo support.

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
She'll wear a hat, it'll be like a Mario hat or suspenders or something.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
That's a great idea.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
It's a terrible fucking idea.

10:18.000 --> 10:24.000
She'll wear a peach crown or she'll have the little Rosalina Luna following her or...

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
It'll be something stupid like that and everyone's like,

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
It's got Amiibo support, gotta buy it now.

10:30.000 --> 10:37.000
Like fucking Skyrim on the Switch because it has support for Amiibos.

10:37.000 --> 10:41.000
Alright, let's get to some comments and chat and then you guys can follow up to this.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
JD in chat says,

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
And Dungeon Buster immediately follows that up with,

10:58.000 --> 11:04.000
And I think that's why a lot of these games are getting their second chance life on the Switch for what it is.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Bobby Blackwolf says,

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
Yeah, I am and I'm not with you.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
Like I kind of like the Journey thing.

11:24.000 --> 11:31.000
I liked when they re-released Journey but I understand how not every game necessarily needs to see a second version.

11:31.000 --> 11:36.000
But it is interesting because since the PlayStation 4 isn't fully backwards compatible with PlayStation 3,

11:36.000 --> 11:40.000
I'm not going to count the PlayStation Now stuff because that's a subscription thing.

11:40.000 --> 11:48.000
You know, some of these big games that maybe people who didn't buy a PS3 may be tempted with on a PS4.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
But I do have to admit, to Bobby's credit on that comment,

11:51.000 --> 11:57.000
I do have to admit, when I saw that Shadow of the Colossus trailer at E3 this year, I was kind of like,

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
Okay, cool.

11:59.000 --> 12:07.000
I mean, I know a lot of people really like that game but this Shadow of the Colossus is a game that's getting a second remaster.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
And I was like, that's interesting.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
Well, this is more of a remake at this point.

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
Well, but look at Final Fantasy 4.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
Final Fantasy 4 was on the Super Nintendo.

12:18.000 --> 12:24.000
There was a great, great version on the PSP I bet many people never played because it was on the PSP

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
and I don't think they ever put it on anything else.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
You might have been able to download it on the Vita.

12:29.000 --> 12:34.000
I think that you download it on the Vita because back when Sony did backwards compatibility,

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
you could play the PSP thing on the Vita.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
Yeah, you still can do that now.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
That whole thing.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
And yeah, I'm Shane in the PS4.

12:41.000 --> 12:47.000
So they did that remaster but then there was also the 3D version that they did with the 3DS

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
which ended up being the version that they've also released on Steam.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
And iOS.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
And I think mobile devices, yeah, yeah.

12:53.000 --> 13:00.000
So to be fair, Final Fantasy 4 has also been remastered twice and I've bought them all.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
Have they remastered 6?

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
So I guess I can't shade Shadow of the Colossus too bad.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Did they remaster 6? I know they did 4.

13:06.000 --> 13:12.000
Okay, they did do a remaster of 6 but it was the mobile version.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
And I think they outsourced the graphics or something.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Like it just seems kind of...

13:18.000 --> 13:26.000
It doesn't seem like it's gotten the same TLC that the DS remasters got.

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
Like it just seems like let's update the sprites and throw it out there.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
And it kind of feels a little cheap to me.

13:33.000 --> 13:37.000
And Final Fantasy 6 is not a game that deserves to be treated cheaply.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
But that was my opinion on those.

13:40.000 --> 13:44.000
I would love to see a remaster done like the Final Fantasy 7 remaster for 6.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
For real, right?

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
It would be awesome.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
When is this Final Fantasy 7 remaster going to come out?

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
I'll never. PlayStation 5 at this point.

13:52.000 --> 13:56.000
Okay, now we're really getting into semantics now.

13:56.000 --> 14:00.000
Final Fantasy 7 really isn't a remaster, it's a remake.

14:00.000 --> 14:05.000
And I'm only nitpicking on that one because it is very obvious.

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
The Final Fantasy 7 remake is a completely new game.

14:10.000 --> 14:14.000
But based off the shooting script.

14:14.000 --> 14:18.000
It's like doing a movie based off the shooting script of the original movie.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
You know what I mean?

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
They did Little Orphan Annie in the 80s.

14:23.000 --> 14:28.000
And then they did that new Little Orphan Annie with Jamie Foxx and Cameron Diaz.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
They do this in Hollywood all the time.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
They take the old movie and then they modernize it.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
And most of the time, it's not good.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
But sometimes, it's pretty good.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
I'm trying to think off the top of my head.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
What were some Hollywood ones that were alright?

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
That they modernized and they came out okay?

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
I'm drawing a blank right now because I don't talk about movies as much as I talk about games.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
Well, I mean, some people don't like this.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
War of the Worlds I thought was pretty good.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
But that's more of a redo based off I think the movie.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
It wasn't necessarily...

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
Okay, but actually that's an excellent example.

14:57.000 --> 15:01.000
Because War of the Worlds being that it was a huge radio thing, right?

15:01.000 --> 15:07.000
Then technology got newer, so they did a movie based off it.

15:07.000 --> 15:13.000
In a weird way, it's kind of like the technology for 7 was a lot older in the PS1 days.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
And now they're using the technology for the PlayStation 4 version.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
Yeah, because 7, man, now if you try...

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
It does not. It did not age well.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
Let's see.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
Vidpower in chat says,

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
I guess the definition of remaster is kind of blurry nowadays.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
Yeah, it is. It really is.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says,

15:33.000 --> 15:38.000
Well, wouldn't any movie based on a Shakespeare play be a remaster and a modernizing?

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
I guess in a way.

15:40.000 --> 15:44.000
In a way, but I mean, they carry their own controversies now, don't they?

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
Remember when Baz Luhrmann did Romeo and Juliet?

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
I love that. It was fantastic.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
I love that movie too.

15:50.000 --> 15:54.000
I think it's something about how old you were when that movie came out.

15:54.000 --> 15:58.000
Like if you were a teen around the time that movie came out, like you loved it.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
And then like other people hated it.

16:00.000 --> 16:04.000
Because I know people that just straight up hate that Romeo and Juliet reinterpretation.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
But I loved it.

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
But I mean, in a way, yeah, Bobby.

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
I mean, I don't know if you're being sarcastic or not, but I kind of...

16:12.000 --> 16:16.000
I kind of think, you know, when they redo those Shakespeare plays as movies,

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
sometimes they do it traditionally.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
Like I think there was a Hamlet one a few years ago.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
And sometimes they do it very non-traditionally.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
And you know that you have that.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
So, let's see.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
I'm going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

16:30.000 --> 16:36.000
JD says, I'm a lot less tolerant of movie remakes than for video games for some reason.

16:36.000 --> 16:40.000
E3VL in chat says, Jumanji is going to be horrible.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
Oh, God.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
Do you know, I literally forgot that was happening.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
I forgot that was happening.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
I tried to. Thanks for reminding me.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Thanks for reminding us, E3VL.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Now, go sit in the corner and think about what you've done.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
I'm just kidding.

16:53.000 --> 16:57.000
Jumanji was pretty good, but like, I get it that they're modernizing it.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
And then there's all this stupid fan wink that they're saying,

16:59.000 --> 17:03.000
well, the game just adapted itself to be more appealing.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
Fucking no, it's not.

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
It's just trying to be...

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
Jumanji like was...

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
The first movie was based off of the book a little bit closer

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
because it was basically this game comes alive.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
It starts bringing all this like dangerous jungle shit into the real world.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
And they have to deal with it.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
Granted, the kids' book kind of glosses over most of that stuff,

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
but I mean, that's basically it.

17:24.000 --> 17:28.000
I remember the book was the thing that the teacher would read to the whole class.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
Did y'all do this in school where the teacher would sit in front of the class

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
and read the book?

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
And then this happened, turn the page.

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
And like, yeah, I remember Jumanji was like that book.

17:38.000 --> 17:43.000
Yeah, and the Jumanji, you know, the first movie was pretty good with Robin Williams.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
And you know, it kind of like amped up how dangerous everything was.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
This one is some fucking bullshit.

17:48.000 --> 17:54.000
It's an Atari 2600 or 8-bit retro game that's called Jumanji.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
And the kids get sucked into the game and they play their characters in the game.

17:57.000 --> 18:01.000
And it's so hilarious because the hot chick becomes this nerdy guy

18:01.000 --> 18:05.000
and like all this funny stuff because they're breaking their molds

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
and they're going to learn something about themselves.

18:07.000 --> 18:11.000
And fuck this movie in its fucking ass because it looks terrible.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
Slow your roll.

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
Why the fuck did The Rock sign this?

18:16.000 --> 18:21.000
This is about as bad as when Brendan Fraser signed up for the fucking Journey to the Center of the Earth.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
Money, money, money, money, money. It's all about money.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
All right, let me ask you this. Calm down for a minute.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
Go to a happy place.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
I know this isn't totally games, but humor me for a minute here.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
It's a slow news week.

18:30.000 --> 18:35.000
Loki, let's say you are the next big Hollywood producer.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
What movie would you remake and what would you do to it?

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Would I remake?

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
Yeah.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
I'd do a live action Macross franchise.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
Oh, but you saw what happened with Ghost in the Shell.

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
I wouldn't be fucking stupid like that, okay?

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
I didn't have some fucking respect for the goddamn material.

18:52.000 --> 18:57.000
Hire actors that are the nationality of the characters, okay?

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
We don't need a fucking Scarlett Johansson in the movie.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
Just fucking make it good.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
Why is that so hard?

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
Make it good.

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
Dark Soccer, I got to poke you with the same question.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
And then I'm going to ask about games, Loki, so be thinking of that.

19:10.000 --> 19:16.000
Dark Soccer, what would you remaster if you could go to Hollywood and any movie you could remake?

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
What would you do?

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
I wouldn't.

19:18.000 --> 19:22.000
I'd do a new fucking franchise.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
You refuse.

19:23.000 --> 19:27.000
There's no movie worthy of modernization.

19:27.000 --> 19:31.000
I'd make an actual Mass Effect movie.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
That's what would happen.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Supposedly they were working on one.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
Well, they're wrong.

19:35.000 --> 19:41.000
I hope this shit with Andromeda does not push that movie off track.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
I really don't.

19:43.000 --> 19:48.000
I don't know, I would actually do an HD remaster of the first Dragon Age.

19:48.000 --> 19:53.000
I'll tell you what, I'd go back and remaster and not remaster and make a fucking other sequel.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
A new Tron movie.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Because fucking hell, we need a new Tron movie.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
There you go, there you go.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
Fucking remastered shit.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
What are they talking about?

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
Like remastering with Jared Leto?

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
Fuck that.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
It's such a terrible, stupid...

20:05.000 --> 20:09.000
Hey, let's take this great franchise and fucking shove it into the ground, okay?

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
That's gonna be fantastic.

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
Okay, so what about games?

20:16.000 --> 20:19.000
What game do you think needs to be...

20:19.000 --> 20:23.000
And I posted this to the chat as well, you guys, over at live.vognora.com.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
What game...

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
And you can go as far back as you want.

20:26.000 --> 20:34.000
What game needs to be remastered, modernized for PlayStation 4, Switch, wherever you want to put it.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Xbox One, PC.

20:36.000 --> 20:41.000
Well, I mean, the easy option, and I hope it's actually something that's gonna happen,

20:41.000 --> 20:45.000
because I know they did a poll for it, would be R4.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
I would like to see...

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
I want a new Ridge Racer.

20:47.000 --> 20:51.000
I know that the last game that they did was like a fun fucking money grab shit.

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
And that didn't sell well for them, so good.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
It shouldn't, because it was crap.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
But like make...

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
R4 is probably the best Ridge Racer game that they put out.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
Remaster that.

21:00.000 --> 21:03.000
Make it look good.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
You can add tracks from the other games.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
I don't give a shit.

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
Just make another good Ridge Racer game.

21:09.000 --> 21:13.000
I'm gonna tell you what game I'm thinking of when I'm asking this question,

21:13.000 --> 21:17.000
and I think they're doing a phenomenal job with it, is Blaster Master Zero.

21:17.000 --> 21:21.000
And you know I love that original Blaster Master game, and I like the new one a lot,

21:21.000 --> 21:25.000
but what I'm really liking about it is the continued value of the game.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
And we'll talk...

21:26.000 --> 21:30.000
I know we have a story coming up on it later, but the DLC in that game is pretty outstanding.

21:30.000 --> 21:34.000
We can get a Fester's Quest Zero, how about that?

21:34.000 --> 21:37.000
I think Fester's Quest was kind of underrated personally,

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
because it was just the overhead shots from Blaster Master as a game,

21:40.000 --> 21:44.000
but yeah, hell yeah, why not Fester's Quest re-updated?

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
Have like Fester in there as a special character.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
Why not?

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
Oh my god, get Fester in the DLC for Blaster Master.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Like surely there's no licensing issues there.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
Dar Sakura, what about you?

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
I'd already said Dragon Age.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
Oh yeah, sorry, you said Dragon Age right at the tail end.

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
But what about like, um...

22:00.000 --> 22:04.000
Oh, like Zombies Ate My Neighbors, or...

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
Yeah, I've always thought about that.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
That's a good pick.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
That's a good pick.

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
I am surprised you did not immediately say what I would be saying.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
The Guardian Legend.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
The Guardian Legend, yes, thank you very much.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
TGL.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
Thank you.

22:16.000 --> 22:21.000
They've already redone Fantasy Zone with the Sega Ages collections.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
Oh, true.

22:22.000 --> 22:28.000
It had like the Sega 2800 or whatever it was.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
The cheaper packages that were the 3D remakes.

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
So both that and Space Harrier have already been done,

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
so the Guardian Legend would have to happen.

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
And not just Gardic, we want Gardic Gaiden.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
All right, let me go to chat over at live.familynetwork.com.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
Some great answers to chat.

22:42.000 --> 22:45.000
Bobby Blackwolf suggests Katamari Damacy.

22:45.000 --> 22:48.000
That game's due for another chance.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
They did a remaster of that not too long ago.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
That was the one they did for like Xbox.

22:52.000 --> 22:55.000
I mean, the later games, they just kind of said,

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
eh, we don't know how to make any new levels,

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
we're just going to bring those levels back.

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
It was the PlayStation 3 version, was like a best of...

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
No, it was the Vita.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
Vita was the last proper release for that game, I think.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
Yeah.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
I think it's...

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
Enough time has passed.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
Yeah, clicker games don't fucking count.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
Um, let's see.

23:12.000 --> 23:15.000
Especially now with like all the processors being able to handle

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
all these different objects and everything,

23:17.000 --> 23:20.000
I would think it'd be pretty awesome to see what Katamari game.

23:20.000 --> 23:23.000
J.D. says, Mother 3.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
Well, you have to release it first before you remaster it.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
You have to release it first, Tiger.

23:28.000 --> 23:32.000
Oh, that was something that they were going off on the entire time

23:32.000 --> 23:36.000
of several of the runs at Summer Games and Quick.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
Yeah.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
As they should.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
I mean, for serious.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
For serious.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
He fucking...

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
They know that they want it released.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
Why aren't they doing it?

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
Because they're being assholes.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
SSG100Matt says,

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
OLR is due to get in trouble over a Katamari game again.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
Oh, shut up.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
Let's see.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
Tigerclaw says,

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
I know one game that needs a remaster or remake,

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
and this one is very dear to you.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
Super Metroid.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
Why?

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
Because Nintendo is remaking Metroid 2, so why not?

24:03.000 --> 24:06.000
Let me tell you why I don't want them to remake Super Metroid.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
It was good the way it was.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
Because you can't improve perfection.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
You can't improve perfection.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
All that laugh aside,

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
because I know that will get a reaction out of Bobby,

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
all that talk aside,

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
I would say, honestly,

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
I would just encourage them to do a new 2D adventure.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
They don't have to be remakes.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
I would go for a Metroid maker.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
That would be kind of awesome, actually.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
I like this answer from Dungeon Buster.

24:29.000 --> 24:33.000
Fantasy Star, the first one as a Western release.

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
You know, a lot of the look and feel of Fantasy Star

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
really changed with Fantasy Star Online and stuff.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
It would be very interesting to see the story of the original Fantasy Star

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
kind of in that environment.

24:44.000 --> 24:47.000
But I would also just happily take, you know, PSO2 being released.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
Black Wolf says,

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
Remaster Maniac Mansion.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
I thought they did recently, didn't they?

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
They did.

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
Oh, no, they did Remaster Day of the Tentacle.

24:55.000 --> 24:58.000
I thought they did Maniac Mansion too, but maybe not.

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
I don't think they did the remasters of all the...

25:02.000 --> 25:05.000
Yeah, no, I think they only did Day of the Tentacle.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
They never got around to doing Maniac Mansion.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
They did all of the...

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
What's their prior game?

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
I played a ton of them.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
Why can't I think of this?

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
It's bothering me, I can see.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
I don't think about it.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
But, yeah, they did...

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
They've done a lot of remasters in the past for their games.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
I mean, I don't see why not.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
Let's see.

25:29.000 --> 25:33.000
I'm trying to look at a couple other comments from chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
Let's see.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
That's why I was thinking of Monkey Island.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
There we go.

25:37.000 --> 25:41.000
Tigerclaw says, you can improve perfection with better graphics, better gameplay.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
But that's...

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
The gameplay's perfect, though.

25:43.000 --> 25:47.000
And sometimes, I'm sure we'd love to see in a marathon someday.

25:47.000 --> 25:51.000
I suppose you could give it the treatment that StarCraft is getting.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
With, you know, they're not really changing the game.

25:53.000 --> 25:57.000
They're only changing the graphics and the way the internet part of it works.

25:58.000 --> 26:04.000
Just have the team that does all the fucking cel-shaded shit for the Rayman series,

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
remaster that game, and leave everything else the same.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
Just remaster the graphics.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
Alright.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
I guess I could go with that, for sure.

26:12.000 --> 26:15.000
Bump up the lighting and make it all cool-looking.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
Turn up the graphics on level 3?

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
Absolutely.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
Alright.

26:19.000 --> 26:24.000
Well, we'll see what the game industry has in store for remasters and remakes in the future.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
But for now, we're going to move on with our show.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
We're going to talk a little bit about our gaming weeks.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
I'll go to Dark Soccer in just a moment here.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
But first, some quick plugs.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Again, I do want to just mention, of course, our Facebook.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
And we're also on Twitter as well.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
I already plugged the Discord, although I was going to do it here.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
So, I'll plug it again.

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
The new Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

26:45.000 --> 26:50.000
And we should be here every show for the next few weeks.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
I will mention this.

26:51.000 --> 26:58.000
There will be no show over Labor Day weekend because, as usual, has been the case for the past few years.

26:58.000 --> 27:05.000
I will be at Dragon Con in Atlanta that weekend along with Bobby Blackwolf and hopefully some other folks from VOG as well.

27:05.000 --> 27:10.000
Very fortunate this year to be recognized as a professional at Dragon Con.

27:10.000 --> 27:16.000
Very thankful to the podcasting track and buddies over there who really encouraged me to go for that designation.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
And, yeah, it worked out this year.

27:18.000 --> 27:23.000
So, I'm really, really looking forward to participating even more with Dragon Con as a show this year.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
So, it's going to be a fun, fun year at Dragon Con.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
Really looking forward to it.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
But we won't be here Labor Day weekend as a result.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Most of you are traveling anyway.

27:30.000 --> 27:34.000
But we hope, if it's reasonable for you, you'll be traveling over to Dragon Con.

27:34.000 --> 27:39.000
Anyway, let's get into our gaming weeks and the types of video games we've been playing this week.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

27:40.000 --> 27:44.000
I have been playing Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2.

27:44.000 --> 27:50.000
I actually didn't play any WoW this week, I don't think.

27:51.000 --> 27:58.000
I've been playing my cell phone games and Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2. That's it.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball.

28:00.000 --> 28:03.000
I'm kind of rediscovering the love. It's been pretty fun.

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
Yeah, there's nothing wrong with that.

28:04.000 --> 28:11.000
And I think I've watched now every episode of Dragon Ball Z again, just fast forwarding past the fillers, like in the last week.

28:11.000 --> 28:18.000
And I have to say this up front because I did poll everybody in the room before we did the show tonight.

28:18.000 --> 28:22.000
But none of us did get around to watching that Castlevania anime, so we can't really talk about it tonight.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Do you plan to at some point, DarkSakura, watch it?

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
Yeah, probably this week.

28:25.000 --> 28:34.000
Yeah. I'm okay with it only being four episodes because that makes it a lot easier to kind of consume, if you know what I mean.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
I can kind of treat it a little more like a movie.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
But I'm hearing really good things about it.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
Yeah, it looks good.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
Yeah, so I'm excited about that.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
I didn't play a whole ton this week.

28:44.000 --> 28:50.000
I did end up playing a little bit of Playstation VR yesterday because we had some friends over and I was showing them that.

28:50.000 --> 28:57.000
And then I decided to get into the game, so I did play a little bit of Until Dawn Rush of Blood, which I still love that game.

28:57.000 --> 29:05.000
It would be fun to speedrun that, but I don't think you can because it's on rails and there's minimal things you can speed up in that.

29:05.000 --> 29:12.000
I mainly just played mobile games, so still playing the Office Space one.

29:12.000 --> 29:15.000
I played very little of Pokemon Go.

29:15.000 --> 29:20.000
I know they have different things going on, but I don't know.

29:20.000 --> 29:23.000
It's not up to really kind of get me playing the game a lot.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
Although, I keep running into inventory problems now.

29:25.000 --> 29:31.000
I've accumulated so many Pokeballs that I'm like, geez, I've got to start catching things because I have like 175 Pokeballs.

29:31.000 --> 29:37.000
I've got to start throwing them away just to be able to keep getting my daily spins on stuff.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
So, I don't know.

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
That's pretty much it.

29:40.000 --> 29:46.000
I've been trying to work on the Game Jam stuff.

29:46.000 --> 29:54.000
I've been falling asleep while working on the Game Jam stuff, so not much has been getting accomplished there.

29:54.000 --> 29:59.000
But I'm trying. No promises. That's it.

29:59.000 --> 30:03.000
Okay. I have to admit, I haven't really been playing a lot this week.

30:03.000 --> 30:08.000
On a personal note, my mom went back in the hospital on the 4th of July.

30:08.000 --> 30:12.000
That's the thing that happened that kind of ruined the holiday.

30:12.000 --> 30:17.000
And she's been asleep since then after having a couple surgeries.

30:17.000 --> 30:25.000
The doctors say she's going to be fine and she's on a path to getting better.

30:25.000 --> 30:29.000
But obviously, it takes an emotional toll. I'm sure you all can understand.

30:29.000 --> 30:33.000
So anyway, not to be too much of a downer, but that's the reality.

30:33.000 --> 30:37.000
Why I haven't been streaming a lot this week and why I haven't been playing a lot this week.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
Real life happens sometimes.

30:39.000 --> 30:45.000
But when I have been playing games, I've been playing a bit of Pokemon Go with Alan.

30:45.000 --> 30:48.000
Just because Alan's kind of into it, I'm into it.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
The new rating thing is actually really rad.

30:50.000 --> 30:55.000
I'm liking it more and more because we actually do it.

30:55.000 --> 30:59.000
It's not impossible for Alan and I to go take out a gym together.

31:00.000 --> 31:07.000
Our little strategy that we do now, we go out at like 11 o'clock, 11.30 and take gyms.

31:07.000 --> 31:10.000
So that way they stay up overnight and we get our 50 coins.

31:10.000 --> 31:15.000
We don't take a lot. We'll take like 2 or 3 to make sure one of them stays up overnight and we get our 50 coins.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
And that's kind of like what we do now.

31:17.000 --> 31:23.000
So that's like a fun thing to do and still catching what we can and all that stuff.

31:23.000 --> 31:31.000
But I would say if I have been gaming, it's been like all Final Fantasy XIV and the Stormblood expansion which I'm still making my way through.

31:31.000 --> 31:38.000
And apparently I only have like 2 or 3 quests left before I'm done with the expansion.

31:38.000 --> 31:47.000
And the story has definitely been ramping up and it's like everything is leading up to the big final conflict and Final Fantasy style.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
So excited to finally finish that.

31:49.000 --> 31:56.000
And I got to say, I think I preferred the Heavensward story better.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
But Stormblood is great. Don't get me wrong. Stormblood is great.

31:58.000 --> 32:04.000
But I think there's some great characters in Stormblood that are really, really like...

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
You're really interested in a lot of these characters.

32:07.000 --> 32:11.000
And the bad people are like really, really bad and well done bad.

32:11.000 --> 32:14.000
And the good people are also really, really well done.

32:14.000 --> 32:20.000
So I think you can almost get into the characters in a way that I only felt a big connection with just a couple in Heavensward.

32:20.000 --> 32:24.000
Even though I felt the story was better in Heavensward.

32:24.000 --> 32:27.000
So yeah, been playing a lot of Final Fantasy XIV.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
But other than that, that's pretty much my gaming.

32:29.000 --> 32:33.000
But I am looking forward to Final Fantasy XII next week.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
I will definitely be picking that up on Tuesday.

32:35.000 --> 32:38.000
Now, I saw just briefly something. I don't think it's in our show role.

32:38.000 --> 32:43.000
It was someone was complaining about how there's a housing shortage in Final Fantasy XIV.

32:43.000 --> 32:52.000
Oh yeah. So on one of the servers, some guys bought up like all the houses in one of the wards.

32:52.000 --> 32:57.000
So there's like a limited number of player housing that you can have on the servers in Final Fantasy XIV.

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
I guess it boils down to storage space.

32:59.000 --> 33:04.000
So on one of the servers, which isn't even the one I play on. It's one of the lesser populated servers.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
Somebody bought all the housing on there.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
And I don't remember what the point was they were trying to make.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
But there was some point they were trying to make with it.

33:10.000 --> 33:16.000
And it's just, it's interesting because the space for housing is limited in that game.

33:16.000 --> 33:23.000
And I've already seen it cause things where people buy plots and then flip them, try to sell them for twice as much.

33:23.000 --> 33:27.000
Like scalping, basically virtual scalping of these limited plots.

33:27.000 --> 33:31.000
And I understand there's like storage and server issues.

33:31.000 --> 33:36.000
But I really wish the team would find a way to really like dramatically increase the size of the housing.

33:36.000 --> 33:40.000
Though to their credit, I mean they have expanded it several times.

33:40.000 --> 33:44.000
Like they are trying to address it and expanding it in different ways that they do.

33:44.000 --> 33:47.000
Why can't they just let them only own one house?

33:47.000 --> 33:55.000
Well because what they're doing is they're rolling new characters, sending the money to the other characters and then buying them on the other characters.

33:55.000 --> 33:59.000
So even if they are limited to just one, they're just not allowed to send money.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
It should be one per account. It should be limited.

34:01.000 --> 34:04.000
And I know there should be other stuff in place.

34:05.000 --> 34:11.000
Well the interesting thing about that is that it will probably get back to the development team on Final Fantasy XIV with all the press coverage that's been getting.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
And they'll do something to address it.

34:13.000 --> 34:18.000
But they have, so right now in the game there's three housing areas.

34:18.000 --> 34:24.000
And they're about to open a fourth because of this expansion there's now a new housing area for Kugane.

34:24.000 --> 34:29.000
Which is the new big city that is going to have a whole ton of new plots to go with it.

34:29.000 --> 34:32.000
So I assume that will help address the issue.

34:32.000 --> 34:37.000
And they also at one point did what's called apartments which don't have a limit on them.

34:37.000 --> 34:46.000
You can have a personal apartment for a set amount of money and as many players as wants to can have those.

34:46.000 --> 34:49.000
So they're trying to address it in weird ways.

34:49.000 --> 34:55.000
But sometimes the way they design things in that game kind of boxes them in.

34:55.000 --> 34:59.000
And I feel like a ton of it dates back to 1.0.

34:59.000 --> 35:04.000
And I realize there was no player housing in 1.0 but it's something about those servers and all that stuff.

35:04.000 --> 35:08.000
I feel like they got boxed in somehow and they still are trying to.

35:08.000 --> 35:13.000
I mean the whole class and job system they're still boxed in from 1.0.

35:13.000 --> 35:19.000
And every expansion so far they've done something to kind of further separate themselves from that.

35:19.000 --> 35:22.000
They eliminated cross classing in this recent expansion.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
They just eliminated the cross classing.

35:24.000 --> 35:29.000
You no longer have to level Thaumaturge which is just Black Mage.

35:29.000 --> 35:32.000
Thaumaturge and Archer in order to get Black Mage.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.000
You don't have to do that anymore.

35:33.000 --> 35:42.000
So they did something new instead called role actions where you have a pool of 10 actions and you can pick 5 of them for your class.

35:42.000 --> 35:47.000
And it's very similar to the cross classing but you don't actually have to level anything besides the class you want to play.

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
So it's kind of interesting in that way.

35:50.000 --> 35:56.000
So let's see. Vidpower in chat says, what does housing do for players in Final Fantasy XIV?

35:56.000 --> 36:07.000
Not a lot. Most of it is visual. However, there's the airship stuff that you can send out on the exploratory voyages.

36:07.000 --> 36:10.000
And I think you can only do that with a house.

36:10.000 --> 36:14.000
You might be able to do it with apartments though. I don't remember.

36:14.000 --> 36:18.000
See my free company has a house so I don't have to worry about any of this stuff.

36:19.000 --> 36:22.000
I think it makes sense you could probably do it from apartments too.

36:22.000 --> 36:25.000
Because it would seem weird that they would lock people out of that completely.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
That's been my game of the week. Lots of Final Fantasy XIV.

36:30.000 --> 36:33.000
Although Stormblood's been great and it's been many hours.

36:33.000 --> 36:38.000
Now that all the launch issues are fixed, Stormblood's great.

36:40.000 --> 36:46.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio with VoGnetwork.com, use the passphrase, earthquake.

36:47.000 --> 36:52.000
Okay, let's get into some gaming news, shall we? Lots of other stuff going on around the gaming community this week.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
We'll start off with Loki.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
Yeah, so this is kind of neat.

36:56.000 --> 37:07.000
I guess I understand why they may have held off on it, but now they're allowing you on the Xbox Live game store.

37:07.000 --> 37:16.000
You can actually purchase, or you're going to be able to make purchases soon and actually gift those digital purchases to friends.

37:16.000 --> 37:20.000
So right now I know one that pretty much Steam does it.

37:20.000 --> 37:26.000
I don't think PlayStation Network or even Nintendo's or even Microsoft's currently allows it.

37:26.000 --> 37:31.000
But it is going to be something that's going to be added pretty soon here.

37:32.000 --> 37:44.000
Which is good. I'm glad that they're going to have more options available if you want to gift someone something for their birthday or whatever.

37:44.000 --> 37:51.000
The other thing that they're talking about adding that's not really confirmed yet is deleting achievement-less games.

37:51.000 --> 37:57.000
But they haven't really added that. It was on the 360, but they never added it to the Xbox One.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.000
So that's kind of nice.

37:58.000 --> 38:04.000
I wish I could do that with my library on the PlayStation Network where I could delete games I don't want on there.

38:04.000 --> 38:08.000
I have demos for shit, like a demo for Black Ops or something like that.

38:08.000 --> 38:13.000
I thought the trophy list stuff was on play. Oh, you mean you want it out of your library?

38:13.000 --> 38:17.000
Out of my library. I don't want it to display more. I don't need to have a demo for Lego Batman 3 anymore.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
Or the Destiny Alpha.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
I don't need that in there.

38:22.000 --> 38:29.000
Yeah, a bunch of that stuff. I wish I could just say, please leave my library or something like that.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
Or don't display it anymore.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
Or move to bottom or something.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
Yeah, remove from the active list.

38:35.000 --> 38:40.000
Or separate it to a demo thing that only appears in demos or something like that.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
I wish I could do that.

38:42.000 --> 38:47.000
Well, the gifting thing, it's one of those things where it's kind of weird that it's not already there.

38:47.000 --> 38:54.000
It's probably a good thing, though, because remember with all the problems that they had with the whole digital people stealing accounts and stuff like that.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
Maybe it's a good thing that that's not a thing right now.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
Didn't exist then, yeah.

39:00.000 --> 39:08.000
But even still, people were still buying really expensive loot packs, which I think that's maybe even worse because they can buy multiples of those.

39:08.000 --> 39:15.000
But I don't know. It is something, though, that I think is a feature that they should have.

39:16.000 --> 39:21.000
Yeah, I mean, I think we've all gifted each other stuff on Steam before.

39:21.000 --> 39:24.000
You just bought me genital jousting for my birthday.

39:24.000 --> 39:28.000
Nothing says happy birthday like genital jousting, that's for sure.

39:28.000 --> 39:37.000
But yeah, it would just make sense that you could have a wish list on Microsoft, Xbox.

39:37.000 --> 39:51.000
Well, also, I mean, since it is becoming one ecosystem with the PC, I mean, in a way, you could gift like Forza Horizon 3 and that would be on your Xbox and PC, right?

39:51.000 --> 39:58.000
For those, I mean, I think it's still limited what games do that, but that's still a cool option that you can gift it to somebody and they get it on both.

39:58.000 --> 40:05.000
So I'm kind of surprised now a feature like that doesn't exist on PlayStation or Switch even.

40:05.000 --> 40:16.000
Well, PlayStation I'm not too surprised with because there's a lot of features that people want that they're just not going to put out because the system's just not capable of doing that, you know, like emulating a PSP or PlayStation 1.

40:16.000 --> 40:24.000
Those advanced PlayStation 1 graphics, you know, the PSP could do the PlayStation 1, but you see, the PlayStation 4 just can't do the PlayStation 1.

40:24.000 --> 40:27.000
So therefore, the PSP is definitely the more overpowered system.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
Right.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
Just bet you didn't know that, you know.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
There's so much power in that thing you never realized.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
Exactly.

40:34.000 --> 40:41.000
It would be great if they would just release a little UMD reader that you could hook up to via USB to the PlayStation 4, but I just somehow don't think that's going to happen.

40:41.000 --> 40:42.000
It's just not on their list.

40:42.000 --> 40:46.000
We don't need to go with UMDs. That was kind of dumb, but.

40:46.000 --> 40:51.000
I still, do you know I still see UMDs for sale at like Fry's and stuff, but I think I was at Dimple the other day.

40:51.000 --> 40:59.000
That was going to be the next big thing, remember? They were going to have all these movies and stuff that you could play on your PSP and it was a neat idea.

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
And then they came up with Blu-ray, so.

41:01.000 --> 41:04.000
And then they released the Vita, and then they're like, what's a Vita?

41:05.000 --> 41:06.000
And then that was that.

41:07.000 --> 41:11.000
Alright. Moving on, let's talk about Overwatch a little bit.

41:11.000 --> 41:15.000
I did play a little Overwatch on the Public Test Realm, and it was because of this.

41:15.000 --> 41:26.000
Doomfist finally making his way into Overwatch. They've been teasing Doomfist ever since the very original trailer for the game.

41:26.000 --> 41:30.000
Because the two kids, if you remember the very first, like it looked like a fucking Pixar short.

41:30.000 --> 41:37.000
The trailer for the game, the two kids are looking at, oh Doomfist, little fist of Doom or whatever it was, his actual Doomfist.

41:37.000 --> 41:43.000
They were actually looking at that, so now Doomfist is a character that's in the game, so that's really awesome.

41:43.000 --> 41:47.000
And he has some moves where, and I was, I actually tried playing with him a little bit.

41:47.000 --> 41:52.000
So he can kind of shoot rockets out of his glove, but it's not super effective.

41:52.000 --> 41:56.000
What he's really effective at doing is like charging at people, is kind of what he does.

41:56.000 --> 42:00.000
And he can kind of do like a Shoryuken type of move, where he like uppercuts them into the air.

42:00.000 --> 42:05.000
So it is really satisfactory to like rush somebody on the back line, like Ana or something, and then uppercut her.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
So he's just Falcon punching everybody?

42:07.000 --> 42:16.000
Yeah, actually, yeah. So, I mean, Doomfist is, he also can actually punch a, actually the Captain Falcon comparison is not completely like, wrong.

42:16.000 --> 42:19.000
And there's something really rewarding about all of that.

42:19.000 --> 42:33.000
So like, I would play, like, I don't think Doomfist will be a main for me in Overwatch, but I won't be, like, when I get Tracer or Reaper in Random Heroes, I sigh.

42:33.000 --> 42:36.000
Because I'm terrible with those two characters, especially Tracer.

42:36.000 --> 42:42.000
Like, I love Tracer as a character, but trying to play her, I can't do it. I'm terrible with her.

42:42.000 --> 42:46.000
So, but Doomfist, I would be happy to get. Like, Doomfist was a lot of fun to play.

42:46.000 --> 42:51.000
But of course, on the test room right now, everybody's fucking playing Doomfist. Everybody's playing Doomfist.

42:51.000 --> 42:54.000
But, I mean, that's to be expected. Of course, that's what's to be expected.

42:54.000 --> 43:03.000
Now, here's the other thing about Doomfist that I suppose is a little bit controversial, but I think it's very silly.

43:03.000 --> 43:08.000
So Terry Crews is not going to be voicing Doomfist.

43:08.000 --> 43:15.000
And, you know, there was, like, I think Terry Crews had tweeted something about that he wanted to be Doomfist.

43:15.000 --> 43:20.000
So a lot of, like, the Blizzard fan community started, like, going crazy, like,

43:20.000 --> 43:24.000
Yeah, Terry Crews should do it. Terry Crews is awesome. He's a gamer like us.

43:24.000 --> 43:29.000
Well, they didn't go with Terry Crews. They went with an actor, and I'm so sorry if I mispronounce this.

43:29.000 --> 43:35.000
I think it's Seher Ngaouja. I think it's how you pronounce that. Sorry if I mispronounced that.

43:35.000 --> 43:42.000
That is the voice actor that they went with. But when I see tweets about the voice actor they did go with,

43:42.000 --> 43:47.000
I'm seeing all these responses that are like, Blizzard sucks. They should have went with Terry Crews.

43:47.000 --> 43:53.000
Like, it should have been Terry Crews. And I can't help but think, like, that's really fucking disrespectful to the voice actor that did get it.

43:53.000 --> 44:01.000
A, Doomfist's voice is fine. Like, he sounds fine in the game. In fact, he's better than fine. He's good.

44:01.000 --> 44:08.000
He's a good voice actor and a good character. And, you know, I think Terry Crews is fucking awesome too, don't get me wrong.

44:08.000 --> 44:12.000
But, he is a little- He doesn't need to voice everything. He doesn't need to voice everything.

44:12.000 --> 44:18.000
And he does have a certain, like, I would say, like, it's kind of like a, like, loud over the top.

44:18.000 --> 44:22.000
Maybe this is Crackdown 3 influencing that a little bit. And that's the point I'm about to get to, is that-

44:22.000 --> 44:28.000
I think it's Old Spice. He's still gonna get a nice fucking paycheck from Crackdown 3.

44:28.000 --> 44:35.000
Terry Crews, like, is Crackdown 3 right now after E3. And that's a great, like, marriage.

44:35.000 --> 44:42.000
And you know what? Microsoft probably saw a lot of those tweets about Terry Crews doing Doomfist and they probably called him.

44:42.000 --> 44:47.000
So the community did make something- I would bet the community did make that happen for Terry Crews in a way.

44:47.000 --> 44:57.000
I mean, his talents did that too. But my point is, is that, like, don't disrespect this other voice actor because maybe they were looking for somebody that just could deliver a different voice that wasn't-

44:57.000 --> 45:07.000
Because Doomfist, I mean, he's not subdued, but he's not like, oh, yeah, like, over the top, like, whoa, you know, he's not like that at all.

45:07.000 --> 45:13.000
Like, so I think maybe this voice actor they went with is just giving the performance that they wanted.

45:13.000 --> 45:24.000
So I just- I just- I just think it's really shitty when I see those tweets, like, with this other voice actor mentioned and tagged in them going, should have been Terry Crews.

45:25.000 --> 45:34.000
You know what? The business- the business is- sucks sometimes, but at the same time, I will get props to Terry Crews and I'm not blaming him at all for this.

45:34.000 --> 45:41.000
I think Terry Crews is handling it like a professional because he wrote a very nice tweet and he said, Doomfist came out awesome.

45:41.000 --> 45:49.000
It was everything I'd hoped for, like, I'm paraphrasing the tweet, but he wrote a very nice tweet that was like, hey, Doomfist rules, even though I'm not voicing it.

45:49.000 --> 45:57.000
So, you know, he didn't, you know, you know what I mean? Like, he wrote a very nice tweet, which is exactly what a professional does and so that was cool.

45:57.000 --> 46:06.000
So I don't blame Terry Crews at all for any of this fuckery I see on Twitter when people start replying about like, you know, fuck Blizzard, it should have been Terry Crews.

46:06.000 --> 46:13.000
Like, you know what? Sometimes the vision just lined up a different way. You know, give this other guy a chance, give Doomfist a chance.

46:13.000 --> 46:18.000
He's an awful lot of fun to play and yes, the voice work is great as well. So there you go.

46:20.000 --> 46:29.000
Let's see. Also, what is a chat over at live.fognetwork.com. Oh, great question from Bobby Blackwolf.

46:29.000 --> 46:36.000
Is Terry Crews SAG-AFTRA and could it be, and I'm inferring from that, could it be related to the whole strike thing?

46:36.000 --> 46:39.000
I doubt it because he's doing voicing for Microsoft.

46:39.000 --> 46:44.000
Yeah, and the actor they did pick is a screen actor who has on-screen roles.

46:44.000 --> 46:50.000
So this other actor they went with has to be a card member of SAG, has to be.

46:50.000 --> 46:57.000
So I don't think, well, and for all we know, I mean, the voice work actually could have been done a long time ago.

46:57.000 --> 47:01.000
Because again, we knew about Doomfist when they first announced the game.

47:01.000 --> 47:07.000
So it's entirely possible that the voice acting was done a long time ago before the strike happened.

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
But it's a good thought there.

47:12.000 --> 47:18.000
Let's see. Oh, interesting. Over in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Tigerclaw says,

47:18.000 --> 47:24.000
I think it's more like Terry Crews wanted to be in the game more than them asking him if he wants to be in it.

47:24.000 --> 47:30.000
But I don't fault Terry Crews for that. I would love to be a voice actor in a video game.

47:30.000 --> 47:35.000
I think that would be fucking awesome. Wouldn't that be fun to voice a character in a video game someday?

47:35.000 --> 47:42.000
I think that would be great. But I also understand I'm not a professional and they're probably going to hire professionals.

47:42.000 --> 47:45.000
And I'm OK with that. I got my podcast. It's cool.

47:45.000 --> 47:50.000
So, you know, if there's a little indie game someday that maybe I can do a voice over in. Cool.

47:50.000 --> 47:54.000
But, you know, I'm not a professional. We'll leave it to them.

47:54.000 --> 48:00.000
So let's see. CrazyChocobonator in chat says,

48:00.000 --> 48:06.000
to be honest, Doomfist doesn't sound like a video game character's name, more like an extreme version of fisting.

48:06.000 --> 48:09.000
Yes. Yes. There's there's been plenty of those jokes over on Twitter.

48:09.000 --> 48:12.000
It sounds like an Invader Zim character.

48:12.000 --> 48:16.000
SSJ100Matt with a good comparison here. Growing up,

48:16.000 --> 48:21.000
I always wanted Kurt Russell to be Wolverine in a live action X-Men movie.

48:21.000 --> 48:26.000
After seeing Hugh Jackman do it. Well, he did a far better job than Russell could have done.

48:27.000 --> 48:31.000
Oh, you know, the classic example of that in Hollywood classic.

48:31.000 --> 48:35.000
Do you remember when they announced Heath Ledger is going to play the Joker?

48:35.000 --> 48:39.000
Yes. And you remember how everybody was like, what the fuck?

48:39.000 --> 48:42.000
And that wasn't the first time it happened with Batman either. You go further back.

48:42.000 --> 48:46.000
Michael Keaton. When they announced Michael Keaton was going to play Batman, everybody.

48:46.000 --> 48:49.000
The comedian? The comedian? Beetlejuice?

48:49.000 --> 48:53.000
It's going to be bad. What the fuck? Like the Internet wasn't really around back then.

48:53.000 --> 48:56.000
But you better believe there was still like campaign,

48:56.000 --> 49:01.000
like whatever Twitter was back then in the form of postcards and stuff.

49:01.000 --> 49:04.000
Was that when Michael Keaton got to play Mr. Freeze?

49:04.000 --> 49:09.000
It was. No, it was AOL chat rooms and BBS's.

49:09.000 --> 49:15.000
I don't even. BBS's, yes. But the original Batman was like 1989.

49:15.000 --> 49:18.000
I don't even think AOL was really. Maybe Quantum Link.

49:18.000 --> 49:22.000
Yeah, that would have been BBS's then. Yeah, BBS's.

49:22.000 --> 49:28.000
So, yeah. So, I mean, that is. I mean, if you want to kind of compare this to movies,

49:28.000 --> 49:31.000
you know, when they announced that Heath Ledger got the part of the Joker,

49:31.000 --> 49:34.000
I'm sure everybody was like Jack Nicholson five ever.

49:34.000 --> 49:37.000
Like there's nobody's ever going to be better than Jack Nicholson and all this stuff.

49:37.000 --> 49:44.000
And it's like, you know, they were different interpretations of the role.

49:44.000 --> 49:51.000
Like Jack Nicholson. Nothing about Heath Ledger's amazing, mind blowing fucking performance as Joker.

49:51.000 --> 49:56.000
Nothing about that diminished the also amazing job that Jack Nicholson did.

49:56.000 --> 50:01.000
The only thing that tarnished the role of the Joker was Jared Leto.

50:01.000 --> 50:04.000
Sorry, cheap shot. I could help myself. Sorry. Cheap shot. Cheap shot.

50:04.000 --> 50:09.000
To be honest, I don't even blame Jared Leto because I thought he looked kind of cool as the Joker.

50:09.000 --> 50:14.000
I think just the script sucked. So, I mean, I'm not even going to blame Jared Leto for that.

50:14.000 --> 50:18.000
I'm just saying that script was just fucking terrible.

50:18.000 --> 50:24.000
So anyway, we're getting a little off track. But my point is, I think after that point,

50:24.000 --> 50:29.000
after Christopher Nolan cast Heath Ledger as the Joker and everybody was like,

50:29.000 --> 50:32.000
what the fuck, buddy? And then everybody saw that movie.

50:32.000 --> 50:37.000
After that, it was kind of like, okay, Christopher Nolan can do whatever the fuck he wants.

50:37.000 --> 50:42.000
Like clearly the man knows what he's doing. So when they announced Anne Hathaway as Catwoman,

50:42.000 --> 50:47.000
I have to admit there was a part of me that was like, I'm not sure that's what I would have done.

50:47.000 --> 50:53.000
But you know what? I would have said the same thing about Heath Ledger.

50:53.000 --> 50:59.000
So I'm going to, and sure enough Anne Hathaway was a, for that version of the Catwoman,

50:59.000 --> 51:04.000
for what Nolan was doing in that movie, she was fine. She was better than fine. She was great.

51:04.000 --> 51:09.000
Michelle Pfeiffer will kind of always be Catwoman to me in that role.

51:09.000 --> 51:15.000
But even then, you go back to like Eartha Kitt and like the campy 60's stuff.

51:15.000 --> 51:16.000
Julie Newmar.

51:16.000 --> 51:20.000
Julie Newmar, Eartha Kitt, like the classic 60's Batman actresses.

51:20.000 --> 51:24.000
Like they also owned it in their own way. It was just all different. So anyway.

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
I'm sure Halle Berry owned it in her own way.

51:30.000 --> 51:34.000
Look, Halle Berry is a great example that even great actresses can make mistakes.

51:34.000 --> 51:37.000
So you know what? It's all right. Anyway, we're getting off track.

51:37.000 --> 51:42.000
It is a video game show, but I'm bringing all that up as comparisons that it's like, you know what?

51:42.000 --> 51:46.000
They cast somebody else's Doomfist and he's doing great.

51:46.000 --> 51:51.000
So this Terry Crews stuff, even Terry Crews says he loves Doomfist.

51:51.000 --> 51:55.000
So the rest of you need to stop with the bullshit on Twitter and let the guys who are,

51:55.000 --> 52:00.000
gals who are creating Overwatch create the game they want to make. Done.

52:00.000 --> 52:04.000
So Terry Crews, he's still going to be a part of the gaming community.

52:04.000 --> 52:08.000
He's just over there on Crackdown 3, which I bet most of you are going to be buying anyway.

52:08.000 --> 52:13.000
So I think everybody's winning in this scenario. I really do.

52:13.000 --> 52:20.000
All right. Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

52:20.000 --> 52:25.000
JD calling me out on the EarthaKit thing, but I said that before I looked in chat.

52:25.000 --> 52:29.000
It was just very different. But here's the other thing to consider.

52:29.000 --> 52:35.000
I was like 13 or 14 years old when Batman Returns came out.

52:35.000 --> 52:40.000
And in a way, so, okay, I'm going to go, I'm really tangent training tonight,

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
but it's a slow news week, okay?

52:42.000 --> 52:47.000
So Bobby brought up his old comparison about Final Fantasy on his show earlier, right?

52:47.000 --> 52:52.000
And he said, you know, it seems to be that the favorite Final Fantasy game of people

52:52.000 --> 52:56.000
is the Final Fantasy game that came out when you were around 13 years old, right?

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
That tends to be your favorite Final Fantasy game.

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
And for me, that's true. It really is.

53:00.000 --> 53:04.000
Like Final Fantasy 2 and 3 on the Super Nintendo, which of course were 4 and 6.

53:04.000 --> 53:08.000
Those are kind of like a tie for my favorite. So I get that.

53:08.000 --> 53:12.000
I would say your favorite Batman movie might be the same sort of thing.

53:12.000 --> 53:17.000
And Batman Returns was that movie that came out right when I was around 13 or 14.

53:17.000 --> 53:22.000
And I kind of think to this day that movie is grossly underrated in the Batman franchise.

53:22.000 --> 53:23.000
That movie is fucking amazing.

53:23.000 --> 53:28.000
And Michelle Pfeiffer just, you know, like to a little gay boy at 13 years old,

53:28.000 --> 53:31.000
like Michelle Pfeiffer was just everything and then some.

53:31.000 --> 53:35.000
So you know what? Dark Soccer, you loved her too, right? Please, please tell me.

53:35.000 --> 53:36.000
Meow.

53:36.000 --> 53:37.000
Yes.

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
When she did all the flips and she's like, meow.

53:39.000 --> 53:44.000
One thing that I thought was awesome though is that the first whip scene in the department store,

53:44.000 --> 53:45.000
she did it in one take.

53:45.000 --> 53:46.000
Yeah.

53:46.000 --> 53:49.000
I was like, that made me want to whip.

53:49.000 --> 53:50.000
Right?

53:50.000 --> 53:53.000
I just wanted to take the heads off of men who opposed me.

53:53.000 --> 53:57.000
And I'm sorry, did I say that out loud? I meant mannequins. Mannequins.

53:57.000 --> 53:58.000
Representing.

53:58.000 --> 54:03.000
Presenting the patriarchy, which I will dismantle with my whip.

54:03.000 --> 54:07.000
And chat says, I think Halle Berry is a good sport over it.

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
I think she accepted her Razzie for Catwoman.

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
Yeah, I hear she was a good sport about it.

54:11.000 --> 54:16.000
She knows it's a shit movie and she just, if you can't laugh at yourself, what can you laugh at?

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
You know what though? To be fair to Halle Berry,

54:18.000 --> 54:24.000
if Ryan Reynolds can be both the terrible Green Lantern and the fucking awesome Deadpool,

54:24.000 --> 54:25.000
you got a chance to stay.

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
And the terrible Deadpool.

54:27.000 --> 54:28.000
But not his fault.

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
He was also the terrible Deadpool.

54:30.000 --> 54:31.000
He was also the terrible Deadpool.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
That is true, he was the terrible Deadpool.

54:33.000 --> 54:34.000
That was Dev's.

54:34.000 --> 54:37.000
But he was the best part before they made him the terrible Deadpool.

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
Yes, correct.

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
Yes, I forgot about that.

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
Who knew it was going to turn into movie chat on OLR tonight?

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
But you know what? Tangents, they happen.

54:45.000 --> 54:46.000
You know, it's inevitable.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
Games, movies, they go hand in hand.

54:48.000 --> 54:52.000
Alright, Dark Sakura, you got some good news for us this week, right?

54:53.000 --> 54:57.000
Well, we did bring up the summer games done quick a little bit earlier.

54:57.000 --> 55:01.000
And I watched bits and pieces of it here and there, certain runs.

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
The whole thing was pretty amazing.

55:03.000 --> 55:07.000
They beat last year's goal by a significant amount.

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
Or not last year's goal, but last year's total.

55:09.000 --> 55:13.000
Last year, they pulled in $1,294,139.

55:13.000 --> 55:19.000
This year, $1,760,415.

55:19.000 --> 55:20.000
Nice.

55:20.000 --> 55:25.000
So by topping it by almost $500,000 is pretty amazing.

55:25.000 --> 55:28.000
That's some great incentives, too.

55:28.000 --> 55:33.000
I'm sad that I missed the solo co-op Portal 2 run.

55:33.000 --> 55:36.000
But at least you can go back and catch all of those.

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
Yeah, I missed most of that stuff live.

55:38.000 --> 55:41.000
But thankfully, they're really quick to put that stuff up onto YouTube.

55:41.000 --> 55:42.000
So, yeah.

55:42.000 --> 55:45.000
Especially, you know, I tried watching.

55:45.000 --> 55:46.000
I was like, ooh, Final Fantasy VII run.

55:46.000 --> 55:47.000
Eight hours long.

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
Nope, not watching this whole thing.

55:49.000 --> 55:55.000
Some of the crowd interaction was, for me, not just, you know, the commentary couch,

55:55.000 --> 55:58.000
but the way the crowd interacted with it.

55:58.000 --> 56:02.000
Like, they were singing along with the Disney songs in Kingdom Hearts 2.

56:02.000 --> 56:10.000
And, like, when the guy was doing Pungoland, which is just, like, a really...

56:10.000 --> 56:14.000
It was kind of based on Kaizo Mario, but not bad.

56:14.000 --> 56:17.000
Every time the guy would die, they'd hold up a sign and they'd go,

56:17.000 --> 56:20.000
16, you know, for every number that he died.

56:20.000 --> 56:25.000
And I watched the Mega Man X6 and the X2 run.

56:25.000 --> 56:29.000
And it was just amazing watching how good people get with these games

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
and watching some of the clipping tricks.

56:31.000 --> 56:35.000
And the thing that I like about it is that they have people...

56:35.000 --> 56:39.000
Some of the people doing the commentary are also speedrunners of that game.

56:39.000 --> 56:40.000
Yeah, yeah.

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
And I'm glad that I watched the Super Metroid run.

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
Did you hear about the big upset?

56:44.000 --> 56:47.000
You were texting me, and I think I saw that, like,

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
two of them got knocked out right at the beginning, right?

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
Right with the first big boss.

56:51.000 --> 56:52.000
That, wow.

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
Both of them died.

56:54.000 --> 56:55.000
You know what, though?

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
Props to them for getting up on stage and doing it.

56:57.000 --> 56:58.000
It's a lot of pressure.

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
It's a lot of pressure, you know?

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
And sometimes you're gonna make mistakes.

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
So I hope those guys aren't feeling too bad.

57:04.000 --> 57:07.000
But, at any rate, though, so they finally just focused on the last guy

57:07.000 --> 57:13.000
who I don't think had ever done anything for the event before.

57:13.000 --> 57:19.000
He's, like, a fairly new speedrunner, and he finished Super Metroid, like, perfectly.

57:19.000 --> 57:26.000
And this is, I think, the first year that, without any extra help from the sponsor or anything,

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
that they got more for Kill the Animals.

57:28.000 --> 57:32.000
You know, one of our old-school listeners...

57:32.000 --> 57:36.000
I know he doesn't listen anymore, but he's a big part of that speed event.

57:36.000 --> 57:39.000
Kevin DDR does the Tetris stuff.

57:39.000 --> 57:42.000
I hear he did very well on that block.

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
Oh, yeah. We was watching it. It was pretty crazy.

57:44.000 --> 57:48.000
Yeah. No, I know. We do have listeners from, you know, years ago

57:48.000 --> 57:51.000
that go on to bigger and better things that are even bigger than this show.

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
But it's awesome. I love that.

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
I love that when, like, I see people, it's like,

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
oh, I knew that person when they were listening to OLR.

57:57.000 --> 58:00.000
That was, like, really stupidly fast, too.

58:00.000 --> 58:01.000
I had to watch part of that.

58:01.000 --> 58:02.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

58:02.000 --> 58:09.000
But, overall, the great thing about this is it's going to a really good cause.

58:10.000 --> 58:13.000
I'm not going to do it in French. It's the Doctors Without Borders.

58:13.000 --> 58:14.000
Yeah.

58:15.000 --> 58:21.000
And I think that we need to have more charities along those lines

58:21.000 --> 58:24.000
get attention because they provide the treatment

58:24.000 --> 58:30.000
no matter any, you know, walk that the person comes from who needs it.

58:30.000 --> 58:31.000
Right.

58:31.000 --> 58:35.000
And they even go into places where there is some pretty nasty stuff going on,

58:35.000 --> 58:39.000
like war zones and things like that and provide necessary help.

58:39.000 --> 58:43.000
They were a huge part of, like, when that Ebola crisis was going on

58:43.000 --> 58:44.000
not that long ago.

58:44.000 --> 58:45.000
Totally, totally.

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
You know, they were a huge part of help and make sure that didn't get worse.

58:47.000 --> 58:50.000
But the other thing, too, is that it's nice to see something that,

58:50.000 --> 58:55.000
for us, was, you know, kind of, you know, just hobby and leisure and fun

58:55.000 --> 58:59.000
that, you know, has turned into something so wonderful.

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
And the next one's going to be, of course, in January.

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
With awesome games done quick.

59:03.000 --> 59:07.000
Which is technically the flagship run, but, I mean, they're both kind of...

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
Some of those prizes that were pretty nuts.

59:09.000 --> 59:12.000
Let me ask this. What do you think contributes to, I mean,

59:12.000 --> 59:16.000
because half a million more, that's quite a bit more money.

59:16.000 --> 59:19.000
Do you think that's just maybe as simple as it's the logistics

59:19.000 --> 59:22.000
of where the 4th of July fell this year, that you had a lot more people

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
along weekends that could sit at home and watch it?

59:24.000 --> 59:29.000
Or do you think maybe this speed running stuff in this particular marathon

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
is getting more and more visibility?

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
I mean, we saw during awesome games done quick,

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
one of the guys went on Colbert, right?

59:35.000 --> 59:36.000
Yeah.

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
Yeah, so do you think just in general this whole scene

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
is getting more and more visibility in this particular marathon?

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
I think it's a combination of both of those factors,

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
but I truly do believe that it's the visibility.

59:44.000 --> 59:48.000
I mean, and one thing that, you know, I think that the people

59:48.000 --> 59:51.000
who scoffed at, you know, gaming in the 80s

59:51.000 --> 59:54.000
don't seem to realize is that we all grew up.

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
Well, yeah, yeah, I think that's what it is.

59:56.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Those of us that were playing games in the 80s, we're now the adults.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.000
So it's...

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Exactly.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Yeah, it's time to change.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.000
And gaming culture is even more prevalent.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:09.000
I mean, a lot of these systems are a lot easier to come by.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:12.000
If not, you know, the current gen, there's the older ones that you can get.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:16.000
And then classic gaming itself has become a lot more prevalent.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.000
You have people, you know, some of these people who were doing

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.000
some of the speed runs on some of the classic games

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:26.000
were probably born the year that game came out.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Yeah.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:31.000
You know, and to see them enduring like this, I mean,

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.000
it does my ancient heart good.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.000
You know, I have to admit, and maybe I'm probably going to get a little shit

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
for this comment, but I have to just be honest with you all for a minute.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Like, I'm getting to that point now where some of these conventions

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.000
that I've gone to, I kind of start to look around

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.000
and I kind of go, I'm the old guy here.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Am I getting too old for these conventions?

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Never.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
I know, I know, but I can't help it.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
There's certain conventions I've gone to where I kind of go,

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.000
like, I could be everybody's dad.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
It's a weird feeling.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
But I always say the one convention I don't feel that with at all

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:05.000
is Dragon Con, because I feel like Dragon Con kind of like,

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
I think because it's been around so fucking long,

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.000
a lot of people in Atlanta that were going when they were 15

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
are still going now that they're 40.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.000
So I think...

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
See, here's the problem.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.000
If you're sitting there, you know, questioning, am I the old guy there,

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
that means you're not intoxicated enough.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
So that's...

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
And I'm not trying to turn it into a pissing match

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:27.000
of who's the oldest here at VOG and OLR and all that stuff.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:32.000
I'm just saying, in general, I'm starting to feel like

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
sometimes I'm the oldest person there and I'm like,

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:35.000
oh, this is a little weird.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Hey, I'm still going to cosplay as long as I can.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
And I think at the end of the day, don't get me wrong,

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.000
I fucking get over it, I always do, you know,

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.000
because, you know, age ain't nothing but a number, baby.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.000
But I'd be lying if I hadn't said sometimes I go to the cons

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.000
and I go, am I the oldest one here?

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Let's see.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Yes, there it is, on time, the comments in chat,

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
shut the fuck up about getting old.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Tigerclaw in chat says, the majority of speedrunners are very young.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:09.000
I would love to see someone in their 40s or 50s do a speedrun at the event.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Ha, ha, ha.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Well, cheap plug, Tigerclaw, but Flaco Jones here,

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
who's been on OLR many times before

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
and is part of the VoG Network family, really.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
Flaco Jones is the same age as I am.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Like, we're only like a couple weeks apart with our birthdays

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
and he's been submitting that PT speedrun.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:30.000
So I'm hoping he gets in just because it's a great speedrun

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.000
and I think there's a great story behind PT anyway

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:37.000
and the fact that, you know, somebody who's my age should be in there

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
doing the speedruns too, that'd be great.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Ha, ha, ha.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:44.000
All right, all right, I'll stop with the topics

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.000
that are going to get me the shut the fuck up comments.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Let's move on with some other stories. Loki.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.000
All right, so speaking of getting old,

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:58.000
these complaints sound like something that an older individual would have with a game,

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:03.000
but Ubisoft, much like, you know, other companies,

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
will do something special with their games.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:08.000
They'll patch in like a cool holiday event

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:12.000
and so because of, you know, July 4th being Independence Day,

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:17.000
they patched in some fireworks that appear during the nighttime in the game.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:22.000
So between June 29th and July 10th, there'd be fireworks going off at night,

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:26.000
which, you know, for most people it's like, eh, no big deal.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Except apparently a lot of people had problems with it.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:34.000
They thought it was completely obnoxious, fucking annoying,

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
too frequent, too long, and too loud.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Apparently the fireworks were too loud

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.000
and it was annoying them during night missions.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.000
So they would be like kind of sneaking around all of a sudden.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
There's just a lot of booming going on in the background.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:50.000
So, of course, you know, they heard about it, you know.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:55.000
They said, you know, it's not possible to wrestle a fix for this,

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
so we made a tough choice just to remove them.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:01.000
It says the heart says no, but the eardrums say yes.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.000
I kind of want to see a video to see how loud they were.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Sadly, Watch Dogs 2 is one of those games I do need to go back and play

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:13.000
because I did enjoy it, but just haven't played it in a long time.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.000
I would have been curious to see what the fireworks sounded like, though.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
That's kind of funny, though.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Is it one of those things where maybe it was being developed in a studio

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.000
where they're using headphones or something, and on headphones it was okay,

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
but then when it was like on the TV it was like, oh, my God.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Maybe, I don't know, but like someone was saying that it is scaring their dog.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.000
I mean, I get it, but like...

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
But how loud was your television?

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
It's like nitpicking, I think, it sounds like.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Just turn down the sound effects.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Like, okay, but I haven't played Watch Dogs 2,

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:50.000
but I'm assuming there's like gunshots and like other loud things that happen.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
I would think that that would be louder, yes.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
So that doesn't set off the dogs?

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.000
I mean, I don't know. I didn't see this fireworks thing,

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
so I don't know if people are being silly or not,

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:04.000
but it is a little weird to me that like if the gunshots and gunfights

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
that happen in these games don't set off the animals.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.000
For one, if it is setting off the animals, you should probably turn your TV down

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:13.000
or think about headphones, because there's some great wireless headsets

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
for all the systems now that you can pick up.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:19.000
So, I mean, just saying, just saying.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Yeah, so apparently, okay, so here's why it was like that,

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:27.000
because they're saying that apparently a company rep noted that

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:30.000
the people have spoken, we have carried out their will.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:34.000
There was an annoying bug that snuck into our Independence Day event

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:39.000
that made the sound effects from the fireworks noticeable from everywhere on the map.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:43.000
They have been turned off as to avoid further noise complaints.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:48.000
It could be that, because I know like with developing some games and stuff,

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:53.000
that instead of having a positional audio, it's basically just like almost like a sound effect,

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:57.000
like a menu effect, and so basically you're hearing it the same volume

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:00.000
no matter how close you are to those fireworks.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
So maybe that was the situation.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:07.000
But, I mean, it seems like if that was the case, it'd be easy for them to fix, but whatever.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
You people are just getting old.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
If it's too loud, you're too old.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Okay, so I am gonna, I have to listen to hear what this sounds like real quick,

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.000
so I'm just gonna quickly just...

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Can you, can you...

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Okay, those are pretty fucking loud actually, now that I hear.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Can you copy-paste me the link real quick so we can play it over the air?

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Huh?

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Can you copy...

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Yes, I can.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Can you copy-paste me the link so we can play it over the air real quick?

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Yes, it is pretty loud actually, now that I see that, so...

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Yeah, I want to have some frame of reference here, because maybe...

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.000
So let's...

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Maybe I am being too harsh on the complainers.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:46.000
So, alright, so Loki said this is what you get when it's live.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:51.000
Sometimes there's unscripted moments that happen, including links to YouTube videos.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Okay, so I'm gonna look at this YouTube from Nate152.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:15.000
I would think it is kind of loud, but I would think it's one of those things that would be like,

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:19.000
it's more annoying if that is going on the entire...

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Because that's pretty frequent.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:26.000
If that's going on the entire time you're trying to play the game, that would be kind of annoying.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:32.000
If it was one of those things where that happens for like 30 seconds every 15 minutes or something,

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
then I think it would be a lot more tolerable.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Or, like what is being mentioned there, that you have to be in a certain area to hear it would be fine.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:46.000
But I think it's not... I don't even know if it's so much the volume thing, because again,

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
I think the gunshots would probably be just as loud in that game,

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:53.000
but it's just the fact that it's constant and ongoing while you're trying to play this other game.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
That part would be kind of annoying.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Alright, let's see.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Yeah, Bobby Blackwolf says,

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:07.000
It is going on the entire time, even inside buildings and in the water.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Yeah, that's a little ridiculous.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Yeah, and further on in the video, the guy's driving with his radio on,

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
and you can't hear anything over the fireworks.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
It's just loud.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Alright, so maybe it is a little much, so fair enough, fair enough.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Alright, thank you for finding the video there so we could judge for ourselves.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Alright, let's move on to a story about emulation.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.000
A couple stories here about Nintendo emulation,

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:34.000
including some people that have been peeking at the Nintendo Switch

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
and some of the internal parts of it.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Some of the modders who are working on the Switch right now,

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:43.000
because of course, hackers gonna hack, modders gonna mod, right?

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.000
We all know this.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Apparently, they have found there is an NES emulator embedded in the firmware,

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.000
and it's code named Flog.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:58.000
I don't know why, but it is worth pointing out Flog is golf spelled backwards.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:02.000
So maybe this emulator is gonna emulate NES golf.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:05.000
I bet that's what it is, right? Anyway.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
But that is the NES emulator.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.000
It's apparently hiding already within the Switch.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
So yeah, it's already embedded in the firmware.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:18.000
But of course, you have to kind of trust modders that have been in the system looking at stuff.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:22.000
There's no way to otherwise conclusively prove this.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:26.000
But it wouldn't surprise me that they're building that out,

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:33.000
because we know that we will get Dr. Mario, Super Mario Bros. 3,

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:39.000
that will all be a part of this online thing when Nintendo Online officially rolls out.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Which is kind of, we're getting baby steps with everything that's happening with Splatoon 2,

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
which I know we haven't talked a lot about tonight,

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
but Splatoon 2 had a Direct this week,

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:53.000
and Splatoon 2, that's all gonna kick off with the first Splatfest next week,

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
and there's this whole online app that goes with it, right?

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:59.000
So we know the NES games are coming,

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:04.000
so it wouldn't surprise me that there's a NES emulator in there as well.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
SSJ100Matt in chat says,

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Modders were working on a Switch emulator day one.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Oh, of course, of course they were.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
JD in chat says,

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Maybe Nintendo will be a sponsor of Folsom Street Events.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Cause it's flogging, get it?

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
That's funny, I like that.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.000
Anyhow, speaking of emulation,

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:28.000
of course everybody fucking wants an SNES mini.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Like everybody wants a fucking SNES mini,

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
and we all know Nintendo's not gonna make enough,

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:35.000
and I already went on my rant about scalpers last week,

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:39.000
or the week before maybe, so if you didn't hear it, go back and listen to it.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:46.000
But, at least thank god some online retailers are trying to do some things about it.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Amazon UK being one of them.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Apparently they actually went so far as to contact customers to notify them

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:58.000
that if they preordered more than one SNES mini,

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:03.000
it was going to be changed to a max of one console per customer.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:08.000
So anybody who ordered multiple consoles will now just receive one.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Yay! This is a start!

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:14.000
It's not perfect, cause certainly there's gonna be people that are like,

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:17.000
Oh, well now I'm gonna sign on to my spouse's account and my kid's account,

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
you know, so they'll get around it.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:27.000
But, this is a good start, and should hopefully deter some of those room full of SNES minis and NES classics and all that stuff.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:34.000
I believe eBay is doing something as well to try to combat this a little bit.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:41.000
I think eBay's thing though, they are doing a, you can't actually put something on eBay

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:44.000
that is more than 90 days out of its official release.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.000
That they should. I don't think preorders should be on eBay at all, to be honest.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Yeah, so they're scaling it back a bit.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Yeah, I'm with SSJ100, Matt, still waiting for Amazon to do US preorders.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Yeah, what about, I mean, I guess I'm okay if Amazon is taking the time to make sure the system doesn't

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:07.000
What if they don't do preorders in the US?

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:12.000
I don't see how Amazon doesn't do that. Oh, you mean just in general, Nintendo doesn't do any.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
Because they're assholes.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
We'll see.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:20.000
Amazon could also be focusing on all that Prime Day stuff, they probably don't want

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.000
They've really been pushing that.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:22.000
Yeah, they've really been pushing that.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:27.000
It's only for their Prime users that you get the book that SNES.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:34.000
I'd be okay with that. It would be kind of messed up, but I'm a Prime user, I'd be totally okay with that.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:41.000
But I understand where that might not be the best business decision for Amazon.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Well, what if Amazon did this? What if they did two preorder waves?

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:49.000
And the first wave was Prime only and the second was whoever.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Would you feel that that was a dick move or no?

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:55.000
I would think Nintendo wouldn't be okay with that.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:03.000
Because they're basically locking it behind something. It seems kind of silly.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:10.000
In my opinion though, is it worse than when GameStop forces you to buy a bundle to get something?

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Because I don't think so.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
But, yeah, I understand that.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:26.000
And that comes from more of there's no margin in anything, and so they have to make up their margin on that stuff by bundling in things that do have a margin for them.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:32.000
They figure if there's going to be a shortage like that, that they want to make sure they're guaranteed to sell through on that stuff.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:42.000
I think it's more akin to like, I'm going to charge you $20 to make a preorder on this item type of thing.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:45.000
And that doesn't go towards the item cost.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Yeah, at the end of the day, I'm with SSG100Matt in chat.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Honestly though, I have money.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Nintendo, just take it.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.000
I'm with you, buddy.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
It's a tiny Linux machine that plays NES ROMs.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.000
And I want it.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
I mean, that's like, just...

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.000
And I want it, Loki.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Why can't you sell through on it?

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Alright, let's move on. Let's move on to something more modern Dark Sakura.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
What do you have for us?

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Five Nights at Freddy's 6.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:14.000
I bet we're all looking forward to it, aren't we?

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:15.000
No.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Because it's been cancelled.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:22.000
I don't want to cheer. I know the game has its fans, so I'm not going to cheer this, but...

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:26.000
I've been hearing that he's trolling his fans, actually, but we'll see.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
Well, his quote, though, is that,

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:34.000
After forcing myself to keep working on it day after day, I realized something. I just don't want to work on this.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:38.000
He thinks each game should be the last.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
But then...

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
He doesn't want to do it. That's what he said.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:43.000
It might get done.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
Let me ask a two-part question.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Dark Sakura, because you're a fan of Five Nights at Freddy's.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:48.000
Kind of.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
You've made me play the older games with you.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Remember when we did...

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:54.000
One of my early Twitch streams was doing Five Nights 4 with you and Shane.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Yeah.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:58.000
And that's why I'm like, God, these fucking jumpscares.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:02.000
But, do you think it's possible that maybe it is all a troll?

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:05.000
Because he does have a tendency to do these things where he's like,

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
Oh, it's going to release in October.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
Just kidding. It's out today.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:12.000
I don't know. I kind of don't care anymore.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:15.000
Do you think the series has just jumped the shark in general?

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:19.000
I don't know. I mean, it's fans. There's people who will play it.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:24.000
But, at this point, I don't really get excited about releases anymore.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
Only a few here and there.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
Or about people working on them.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:31.000
Because every time I get excited about it, my heart gets broken.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:36.000
So, I just don't care anymore.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:40.000
I will see the game when it's out and then I will be excited.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Was Five Nights at Freddy World that bad? I'm just kidding.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
I didn't play it, honestly.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:49.000
I think a lot of people passed on it after hearing some of the initial responses.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:53.000
But, at the same time, I can also kind of...

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:57.000
Like, I can completely sympathize with this guy if it's not a troll.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:01.000
And this is like, I'm really ready to fucking do something else.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:04.000
And I think that's kind of what Five Nights at Freddy World was.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:09.000
Is this guy probably feels like, oh my god, this is the only thing I can ever do.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:12.000
And maybe he's kind of getting sick of it. You know what I mean?

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:17.000
Like, I've always said, we'll stop doing OLR when we stop having fun with it.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:21.000
You know? So, maybe if this guy is not having fun with it anymore.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:26.000
Or is seeing the joy in it and wants to do other projects that he does see joy in.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:30.000
Even if they don't turn out as great, like Five Nights at Freddy World started.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:34.000
Maybe he has the right to go do it, right? That's art!

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:39.000
At any rate, he says he's not abandoning the series.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.000
So, we'll see what that means.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:45.000
He should just sell it to Microsoft.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
See what they do with it.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:51.000
Alright, but there's still a movie happening at some point, I think, right?

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
Yeah, we'll see.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
Alright, Loki, what's next?

01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:01.000
Alright, so on the mobile game front, definitely things are going pretty well.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:10.000
So, there has been apparently 150 million plus downloads of Super Mario Run.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:14.000
Now, it's not necessarily purchases, but just at least downloads of that.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:19.000
They don't mention how many of those are actually purchases.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:27.000
They're saying though that they have, apparently Fire Emblem Heroes is doing pretty well as well.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:33.000
So, they've made, I guess they have 15 million downloads with that.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:38.000
They're saying though that there's still people paying for that as well.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:42.000
And then, of course, Animal Crossing will be coming soon.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:47.000
They haven't really updated us on Animal Crossing or Zelda or any of those other mobile projects they're working on, huh?

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:48.000
No, not yet.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:53.000
And then on Pokemon Go front, there is the anniversary of Pokemon Go.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:59.000
So, starting July 6th, they're going to be running an event through July 24th.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:05.000
And you'll be able to catch a special Pikachu with Ash Ketchum's hat.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:09.000
So, good luck finding that because I found at least the last event.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:12.000
And I'm not sure about this one because I haven't seen any Pikachus yet.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:16.000
But for some stupid reason, there's no Pikachus that spawn during the entire event.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:20.000
But hey, there is something that you can get your hands on.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:23.000
That's a special anniversary box in the store.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
Yeah, buy that fucking consumable shit.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
It's a horrible value.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:32.000
Unless you really like Ultra Balls and Max Survives, it's a horrible value.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Like, they've done some boxes.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
They did some when Gen 2 came out.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
They did some boxes that were a really good deal.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:39.000
These are not.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:44.000
So, I would just really think twice before buying it.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:47.000
I mean, because I think it's as much.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:52.000
The box costs as much as the raid passes and the incubators would anyway.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:55.000
And then it's like they kind of throw in some Ultra Balls and stuff.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
It's not the best deal.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:03.000
So, usually check your game once in a while because usually Pikachu spawns here at the house.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:04.000
Have you caught one with the hat yet?

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:07.000
No, I haven't. I haven't been very diligent looking.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:10.000
And it seems like when those events happen, that's when the Pikachus stop spawning here.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.000
Exactly.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:15.000
That's what happened last time with the party hat or something like that.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Like, none of them.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:20.000
I was looking for it and nothing would spawn with the Pikachu.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:28.000
So, I can tell you a place downtown, like a park, that I think I heard is a Pikachu nest right now, downtown.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
So, it's not a good place to look.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
Downtown too far for you, Logie?

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:34.000
Yeah, it is too far.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Just to get a stupid party hat on a character.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:39.000
I don't care. Pikachu's shit anyways in the game.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
Yeah, it's kind of sad. I never use my Pikachu or Raichu.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:47.000
Pikachu's are fucking impossible to catch and they're just shit.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
So, I don't know.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Why are the starter Pokemon so hard to catch? It makes no sense.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
Have you done any of the raiding at all? The raidings are fun.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.000
Yeah, I've done the raiding.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:03.000
There's a Flareon on your park over here that's on the raid right now.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:06.000
But I'm like, eh, I have a bunch of those.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:12.000
Boy, those raids pop up frequently. We just caught a Magikarp there earlier.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:13.000
Those are funny.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:19.000
Magikarp can be a raid, but sometimes it's kind of like, well, if I don't do this, I'm not going to do any raid today.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:23.000
Well, plus the Magikarp that you catch, they're almost always wonders.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
So, they're really good for getting Gyarados.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:30.000
Somebody pointed this out last week, is that you don't get wonders and eggs anymore.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:33.000
I'm sorry, you don't get Magikarp's and eggs anymore.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
So, if you want to wonder Magikarp, you have to do the raid.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
So, it's a good way to get that.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:43.000
And I hear shinies seem to be showing up more on the raid thing, but I have yet to get the shiny.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:49.000
So, anyway, let's talk about one more thing here before we get to the classic game of the week.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:52.000
And that has to do with the whole toys to games phenomenon.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:55.000
Or how the breaks are kind of on that right now.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:59.000
You know, Activision isn't doing a new Skylanders game this year.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:00.000
You probably noticed.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Yeah, they've run out of ideas like several years in a row.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
They weren't there at E3 this year.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:07.000
So, what's the deal? Is Activision done with Skylanders?

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:12.000
Did the death of Disney Infinity lead to toys to games kind of going away?

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Well, there's a comment here from Activision's CEO that was being interviewed here.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:23.000
It is trying to look up the guy's name.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:29.000
There it is. Eric Hirschberg, the CEO of Activision, said a new market has been created with Skylanders.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:35.000
It was a way of making toys relevant to 21st century kids who are interactive entertainment consumers in their DNA.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:39.000
And so, on one level, it wasn't surprising to see that rush into the genre.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:42.000
But it certainly did create a more difficult macro environment.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
Skylanders, we're still behind it.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:49.000
We have supported Imaginators with expansion packs in the way that we didn't with previous games.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:52.000
We have a great Skylanders TV series on Netflix.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
I had no idea that Skylanders was on Netflix.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:58.000
Yeah, great to stretch, but yeah, they do have a series on Netflix.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:02.000
I guess Netflix does really try to get a lot of kids programming because Netflix is kind of great for that.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:05.000
I try to get my kids to watch it and they didn't want to.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:09.000
Also mentioning, we have a mobile game in development that we're really excited about.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:12.000
And we're going to see what the right way to continue to invest in it.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
What I know is that people love those characters in that world.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
There's nothing broken about the franchise.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:21.000
It just became a little bit more different as a business proposition with all that competition.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
We shall see how it plays out.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:24.000
Well, there you go.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
But there wasn't that much competition.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:33.000
In fact, actually I would say last year there was just Lego Dimensions and that was your only competition.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:37.000
Well, Bobby Blackwolf in chat over at live.voguenetwork.com says,

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Rumors and sources a few months ago said that Lego Dimensions has been discontinued as well.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:45.000
They allegedly canceled some of the year two expansion packs.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Womp womp.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
I'm fine with that.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
They put out a ton of content.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Yeah, they did support that one game with a shit ton of content.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:57.000
To be fair, I'm blaming Lego for this.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:00.000
That shit's fucking expensive.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:04.000
It's a stupid Lego upcharge and all that shit.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
Those packs are too damn expensive.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
The characters are too damn expensive.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:09.000
I love Legos.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:12.000
I would totally buy all those without even owning the game.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:16.000
But that shit is too fucking expensive to own as it is now.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:19.000
Yeah, I hear you. I hear you.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Alright, well you know what? Let's travel back to a simpler time, shall we?

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:28.000
When you didn't have to have extra toys. Toys were toys. Figures were figures.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:31.000
And you used your imagination to play them.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:34.000
And meanwhile you had your console that was for your video games.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:37.000
And you needed a controller and maybe a power glove.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:38.000
But that was it.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
And incoherent screaming.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:45.000
It's time for the classic game of the week where Dark Soccer is going to step into the vault and find a game that she thinks,

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:49.000
Hey, you brats, you should be checking out this game this week instead.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:54.000
I picked Dragon Ball Z Hyperdimension.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:24:01.000
Which came out for Super Famicom in Japan on March 29th, 1996.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:07.000
And for Super Nintendo in Europe in February 1997.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:13.000
This is also the last of the Dragon Ball Z games to come out for the Super Famicom.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:20.000
It basically follows the anime. It went through the Frieza stuff, the Kid Buu stuff.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:26.000
You have to continue credits after certain characters' deaths.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:30.000
And some of it is not quite perfect with the story.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:35.000
But the thing that I really liked about this game in particular is the desperation moves.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:43.000
You basically start off with a life bar of 99 points or whatever.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:50.000
And you can charge it from 1 to 99. Sorry, I was missing that.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:56.000
But when it hits below 80 you get your desperation moves that cause higher damage.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:59.000
And it also has different tiers on the levels.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:04.000
So you can fly and hit from your different levels.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:08.000
You can do the background and foreground kind of like in Fatal Fury.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:11.000
And it was just a really solid fighting game.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:17.000
The other thing too is that since this was a later Super Famicom game.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:20.000
The sprites are super gorgeous.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:25.000
I mean it's one of the prettiest, I would say, fighting games that came out on the system.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:31.000
It also has a tournament mode so you can play with up to 8 people.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:38.000
In a tournament style game, I mean pretty much it's called tournament mode.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:47.000
But you also have a full practice mode for practicing your attacks and all of that too.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:56.000
And you can also do an extra type of versus mode that lets you either fight against a character.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:02.000
Or for 2 players against each other. It's how it was with fighting games.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
The thing I liked was the tournament mode.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:09.000
And I was lucky enough one time to play a tournament mode with this game when I was in college.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
It was really fun.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:15.000
You've got a cast of 8 characters.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:19.000
And you've got some non-playable characters.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:25.000
The story mode in here is a little bit different.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:29.000
It didn't have exactly the right characterizations for who played what.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:32.000
But it was a really good game.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:45.000
On top of that, you also have special fights that you can do if you clear a story mode without using a Senzu Bean.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:49.000
And one of them is fighting Gotenks, which is actually a fun fight.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:53.000
So anyway, there's really not much to say about this game.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:57.000
It only came out on the Super Famicom.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:00.000
It wasn't released for any other system.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:05.000
One of the disappointing things about this is that it didn't have my favorite character in it.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
Which was playing Future Trunks.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
But it was also the first one that you could play as Buen.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
And that was pretty cool.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:16.000
But the game that was just...

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:21.000
I mean, I could talk about Shinbutoden, which was on Saturn.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:25.000
I still think this is honestly almost a better game.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
And that's it.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:30.000
Dragon Ball Z Hyperdimension.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:31.000
But this is not...

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:36.000
Now, you'll have to forgive me because my knowledge on the import games for Super Nintendo is not as strong.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:40.000
But this is not the only Dragon Ball Z game on Super Nintendo, right?

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:43.000
Because I remember playing one, but it wasn't this.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:46.000
Because I'm looking at this and I'm like, no, this is not the game I played.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:52.000
No, there was Super Butoden 2 and then 3.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:55.000
And then Hyperdimension was the last one.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:04.000
And then they went on to the Saturn one, which had Shinbutoden and Ultimate Battle 22 for PlayStation.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:10.000
And then we had GT, which actually GT was the first one that came out, out here.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:15.000
Which I sold that game so fast. It was not very good.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:19.000
I kind of wish I waited to sell it because it was worth some money.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:22.000
You know, and I got rid of it at the wrong time.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:25.000
But hey, it's a fun game though.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:29.000
I wouldn't say that it's among my favorites of the series.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:34.000
I honestly do like Super Butoden 3 a little bit better than this one.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:39.000
But it is notable as being one of the last games in the series on that system.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:42.000
And also it's just fucking pretty.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
It was a very late Super Nintendo release in general.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:47.000
It was. It's really, really well done.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:52.000
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Dragon Ball Z Hyperdimension.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
Dark Soccer's been on a Dragon Ball kick lately.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:58.000
I figured I'd have to mention one of the games since I haven't done one before.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:01.000
Yeah, fair enough. I mean, there were a ton.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:06.000
Also, it was back in a day when the internet wasn't as prolific.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
As in, it wasn't there.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:12.000
So, we didn't really get knowledge of a lot of those games that were in Japan only.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:13.000
You know what I mean?

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:16.000
So, when we'd hear about them, it was like, why didn't we get this game?

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:21.000
We had to order from importers that you found in the back of EGM.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:22.000
Yeah.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:25.000
Which is actually how I bought my first import game.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
Which is the Sailor Moon S fighting game.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:32.000
It had Chibi Moon's butt attack.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:36.000
I just remember the video store by me when I grew up,

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:40.000
like, randomly rented some Super Famicom games,

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:43.000
but they would have the converter with it,

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:46.000
so that way when you rented it, you just plug it into your Super Nintendo.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:49.000
And the Dragon Ball, one of those Dragon Ball fighting games, I don't remember which one,

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:52.000
but I would say it's the one that opens with the guy screaming,

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
but I realize I could literally be any of them.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
That's any of them. It opens with someone screaming.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:02.000
So, but that was the first game I ever rented that was a Famicom game,

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:05.000
but I played it on my Super Nintendo, and that was pretty cool.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:10.000
Now, right before I moved out here, I came across,

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:14.000
I had the Ranma ½ hard battle that came out in the US,

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:22.000
and I found that they had the Japanese hard battle at this used game shop,

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:25.000
and they couldn't sell it because no one wanted to buy it.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
It's Alabama. No one wanted to buy a game in Japanese.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:33.000
So I traded my copy, my US one for their Japanese one,

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:36.000
because I had already made the mods to my game genie to play it,

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:39.000
and I was so happy because I had all the good voices.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:43.000
So that's my story about the Ranma ½ hard battle fighting game.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:44.000
All right.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
And I still have that copy too.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Well, we're going to take a quick break, you guys.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:52.000
We'll be back, though. There's plenty more Orange Long Trader to come.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:55.000
We got more news, I think at least one email tonight,

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:59.000
and phone calls at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:04.000
when we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:14.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio Live tonight,

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:20.000
July 9th, 2017, episode number 693 of our show already in progress,

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
and moving into the second half of the show.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:26.000
You know, I realized I forgot a game that I played this week

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
because it was so fast.

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:31.000
So Steam obviously had their huge sale, right?

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:36.000
So I did do a little live stream of Pac-Man Championship Edition 2

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
because I ended up buying that on Steam

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
because it was only like five bucks or something like that,

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
which last week, didn't we get an email that was like,

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
what did you buy in the Steam sale?

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
And at that point, I was like, nothing, but I probably will.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.000
Yeah.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:48.000
Yeah, well, I did.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:51.000
But, you know, part of the whole Steam sale is that

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
around the time the Steam sale happens,

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:56.000
all these other, like, Microsoft was having a big sale on Xbox,

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:57.000
PlayStation had a big sale.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
There's still happening a sale, actually.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
Is the PlayStation 1 still going on, too, or no?

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:02.000
Yeah, I checked it the other day.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:09.000
Okay, so I bought for like $3.74 or something like that, $3.74.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:15.000
It was like a trio of old-ass arcade games, Pac-Man, Dig Dug, and Galaga.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:18.000
And I was like, oh, sure, I've had collections of these games before,

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
but what the hell, it's like three bucks.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:23.000
So I picked up that and I started playing Dig Dug.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:28.000
And as I'm playing Dig Dug, oh, my God, I was popping like a trophy every five seconds.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:33.000
It was like, you got a fruit, trophy, you exploded a monster, trophy,

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:38.000
you crushed two monsters with a rock, trophy, you beat round one, trophy,

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
you beat round two, trophy.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:44.000
There was like so, for like a game that I essentially played a dollar for,

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:47.000
there was probably like 30 trophies in Dig Dug.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:50.000
Now, don't get me wrong, I think that's pretty cool.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:53.000
I know we talked a little bit about the whole trophy thing last week at the top of the show,

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:58.000
but I think it's neat when you take an old-school arcade game like Dig Dug

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:02.000
and do something modern to it like that, like trophies, but I was just like, dang.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:05.000
I didn't realize how freaking loaded this game was with achievements.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:06.000
I started going through the list.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:11.000
I was like, wow, they not only brought in the stuff from the Xbox 360 version of the game

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:14.000
where you can dig out the entire board and get a trophy that way,

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
but there was all sorts of stuff in there.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:19.000
So I thought that was just kind of funny.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:24.000
Something else, speaking of live streaming, because I did do that live stream.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:29.000
It's probably the only live stream I did this week was that stream of Pac-Man Championship Edition 2.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:35.000
I don't know if you guys saw in the office, but Alan bought me for my birthday a green screen.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:36.000
I saw.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
I know you said that. I haven't watched.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:42.000
At some point, go peek in the office because Alan's gaming there right now.

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:46.000
It's like that room is split in two now with this giant green screen on PC.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:49.000
I was like, do we have an unknown spat?

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:53.000
I know, right. Doesn't it look like that thing that siblings do when they're having a fight?

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:54.000
They draw a line down the screen.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
Yeah, I draw a line down the screen. This is your side of the room.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:01.000
No, it's kind of what it looks like now. It's really funny, and it confuses the hell out of the cat.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:04.000
Unfortunately, because it gets really hot in there, like when I'm not using the green screen,

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:10.000
I have to throw it up over the PVC pipe, but I don't want to wrinkle it because that fucks it up.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:13.000
But I have to get the airflow in there because, my God, it can get so...

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:17.000
Because, you know, here in Northern California, in the valley, it's like what?

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:20.000
Yesterday was 105, I think. It's been crazy hot over here.

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
So, yeah, crazy, crazy.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:26.000
Anyway, go to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:33.000
Dart Tetsuya says, I want to say Pac-Man Championship Edition Deluxe Plus was kind of like that with the trophies.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:39.000
Yeah, well, I think it had a handful of trophies, but then they had all their in-game achievements, too, which was interesting.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:43.000
So, yeah. But anyway, just something else I want to throw out there for my gaming week.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:48.000
Old-ass retro stuff. Pac-Man and Dig Dug, even if it is a newer Pac-Man game.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:52.000
And then the green screen, which is... It's still not working perfectly.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:57.000
We have to do this whole thing because there's still folds in it because when they mail it to you, it's all folded.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:00.000
And the folds are causing the green to not pick up right.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:04.000
And yes, I've been in OBS Chroma Key settings and changing everything.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
What's it made out of?

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:09.000
Seriously, it could be a piece of fabric you bought at Jo-Ann's.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:16.000
You know what? Get a wet towel, put it in your dryer, and then tack the end down.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:17.000
Actually, the thing...

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
Or wait, the bottom.

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:24.000
So, Alan went online to try to troubleshoot this, and it's a similar idea.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:30.000
We saw a thing that was get a spray bottle, as your screen is hanging, spray down the screen,

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:35.000
but not enough so that it's actually dripping water off it, but just enough to be wet.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
And then as it dries, it won't be wrinkled anymore.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
I thought that was an interesting solution.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:45.000
You can also get an iron with a steam function.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:46.000
Yeah.

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
And air steam it.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:53.000
Tiger Kyle also points out, green screens require a good amount of lighting in order for it to work properly.

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:54.000
Oh yes, I'm aware.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
I have another light, but here's the thing.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:01.000
So the green screen kit, it did come with a light, but I'm a little afraid to use it because of the heat.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:04.000
But it is an LED light, so I'm thinking it won't be so bad.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
It shouldn't put off any heat.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
Yeah, I just need to fucking try it.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:11.000
But when I look at it, I go, oh my god, I'm not going to use that in the middle of summer.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:15.000
But I think it's an LED light, so you're right, it wouldn't put off any heat.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:19.000
Like this guy here, right next to us in the studio, this puts off heat because this is the more traditional bulb.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:23.000
Which is part of the reason why it starts to get freaking hot in here during the show.

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:26.000
But I don't think the LED light would be as bad.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
Maybe I should sub this out for the LED light.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
It would be cooler in here doing all our...

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:31.000
Anyway.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:34.000
Yeah, as 2100matt points out, Travis has a green screen on his show for a while.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
He got it to work well.

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:40.000
Yes, when I did my stream the other night and I was using the green screen, I did space.

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
Just like Travis used to do.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:45.000
So, you know, a little homage I suppose. There you go.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:48.000
Alright, moving on. We've got to get to some more video game news.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
Let's do some rapid fire news. Loki.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:57.000
So this was surprising because I sort of remembered this was a thing that they were teasing last year or something.

01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:06.000
The Tomorrow Children, which is a game that was one of those strange games that they had during an E3 trailer reel that they were doing.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:14.000
And I guess it did actually come out back in September and is now being shut down November 1st.

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:17.000
Because apparently it's not very popular. But that was pretty quick.

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:18.000
Only 10 months.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:23.000
Well, it's 10 months and they've already announced that it's shutting down.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:26.000
So I guess it will be out for about 14 months.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:30.000
Wow. That's quick.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:33.000
And then of course, you know, this is kind of cool.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:38.000
I did play a little bit of this on PC, but Thimbleweed Park is headed to Switch.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:47.000
So that's Ron Gilbert's new game. If you're a fan of, like, Maniac Mansion or, say, the Monkey Island series, you'll love this game.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:52.000
So that's going to be coming out on Switch soon. Right now it's currently out on PC and Xbox One.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:59.000
This is a game I've heard a lot about, but I just haven't really gotten around to playing yet. So I wanted to check that out.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:00.000
It's pretty good.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:01.000
Yeah, cool.

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:09.000
So we mentioned earlier in the show the Castlevania series. We personally have not got around to watching it yet, but I know a lot of you guys have and I'm hearing a lot of good things about it.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:15.000
But here's the deal. The Castlevania series on Netflix has already been renewed for Season 2.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:21.000
So there it is. Just hours after the first four episodes went live, they renewed it for Season 2.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:25.000
So there must have been a lot of people hitting it right away or they just had a good feeling based on the buzz or whatever.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
So yeah, cool.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:35.000
Season 2 is going to double the episode count. So there will be eight episodes for Season 2 as opposed to the four we had for Episode 1.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:41.000
No word on who's going to write it and so forth, but yeah, hopefully that'll work out well and the fans will be pleased.

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:48.000
And I did allude to this earlier in the show, but let me mention this about Blaster Master Zero officially.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
I think this is really rad.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
New DLC that's available in the game.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:39:01.000
You know, Gunvolt and Galgun were already added as characters in the game previously and I'm so mad because I missed the free period for Galgun.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:04.000
Stupid me forgot to check the game and I missed the period.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:10.000
But I have some chances to get some other characters because they just announced two more characters.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:15.000
I think they announced this at Anime Expo, two more characters that are going to be joining the lineup for Blaster Master Zero.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:22.000
Shantae, you stay, in Blaster Master Zero, but obviously Shantae from The Pirate's Curse and all that.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:29.000
She is the character that just went live a couple days ago and then Shovel Knight is being added into Blaster Master Zero 2.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
That's awesome.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:38.000
So what's cool about it is that they bring their abilities into the Blaster Master format so it feels like you're playing a crossover game.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:39.000
So it's pretty rad.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:47.000
And again, the other thing I really love about the way Blaster Master Zero has been doing the DLC is that for the first two weeks, the DLC is free.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:52.000
Now granted, stupid me, I missed it, but that's my own fault on Galgun.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:56.000
But you know I grabbed Shantae the minute she went up.

01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:01.000
I think it's really cool because that means if you're loyal, you already bought the game when it first came out.

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:07.000
You have a chance to stock up on this DLC whereas people who come late to the party, they're going to have to buy it.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:11.000
So I think that's a really cool thing to do for the early supporters of the game.

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:15.000
So props to the team behind this game.

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:21.000
I'm that gif right now of, who is that, Tajari P. Henson with the cell phone going,

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:24.000
You're doing great, sweetie. You're doing great, sweetie.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
That's me right now with this game.

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:32.000
Alright, moving on to Dark Sakura.

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:36.000
Well, we brought up the Night Trap 25th Edition.

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:46.000
Well, there is another, and I'm using Cody Fingers mode in it, which is a survivor feature, which is really just the regular game.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:56.000
That you have enemies running all over the place and you have to decrease their number until you save everybody.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:02.000
It's the same thing, but at least they're trying to do things with it, so whatever.

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:05.000
Isn't that supposed to be without all the other cutscenes or something like that?

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:13.000
Yeah, something like that, but you're supposed to just see the proper scenes anyway when you go through all the monitors, so whatever.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:23.000
And then for Mass Effect Andromeda, the last patch that came out removed the Denuvo anti-tamper protection,

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:28.000
which has already been proven to be pretty easy to break.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:33.000
There was a challenge that was put out for people to break it and they did it in a few days.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:36.000
They just found out no one wanted to steal the game.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
Stop it.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:49.000
I honestly look at that as the last sign of giving up, so I'm still angry. Anger.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:57.000
No, I already mentioned this to you last week. I had that moment last week where it finally clicked for me and I get it.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
It's frustrating.

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:05.000
Alright, let's move on to happier things, like games that are coming out in stores this week.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
I know we already talked about we have a couple big ones, right, Loki?

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:21.000
That's correct. This week we've got Final Fantasy XII The Zodiac Age on PlayStation 4, Fable Fortune, that's a card game based off Fable that's coming out on Xbox One and Windows PC,

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:30.000
and Derelict Fleet on PC and PlayStation 4, and finally Energy Balance on the Vita. That's it.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:39.000
Traveling to Japan, briefly. Final Fantasy XII The Zodiac Age also getting a Japanese release on the PlayStation 4 this week on July 13th.

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:45.000
There's another game also coming out on the PlayStation 4. It's called Hakoniwa Company Works is the name of this game.

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:52.000
I'm not sure what this is. It looks like it might be a little bit Minecraft-y, but kind of anime mixed in.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:58.000
But I'm getting a very Minecraft vibe from the graphics, like maybe it's kind of building on the success of something like Dragon Quest Heroes or something.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:05.000
But that is a game that's out on the PlayStation 4 this week. Those are the two really big releases.

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:13.000
Nothing really to note on the Nintendo Switch, but the 3DS, there's actually new 2DS-LL, that's what they call it in Japan.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:19.000
The black and turquoise and the white and orange, those are actually hitting Japan this week on July 13th.

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:22.000
And so there are a ton of accessories that go with that as well.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:29.000
But as far as games go, you can check out Hey! Pikmin comes out in Japan this week, along with a new figure to go with that.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:39.000
There's also Ever Oasis has another entry in the game. Ever Oasis, Seirei To Tanibito no Miraje comes out this week.

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:42.000
So there you go, Japanese releases. How about the UK, DarkSakura?

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:52.000
A few things. We have Minecraft Story Mode Season 2 for everything. That's on the 11th, and on the 12th we have The End is Nigh for PC.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:44:01.000
Alright, there it is. To answer this question in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Kasan in chat says,

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:09.000
So is Final Fantasy XII a remake? Pretty much, but it's not the international version.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:14.000
Because they gave it a different name, because they went in and tweaked some stuff with the game.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:21.000
So it's like, you're getting the final edition of the game that had come out in Japan before, but it never came out here before.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:25.000
And what they had tweaked with it is that they kind of redid the job system.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:33.000
Like in Final Fantasy XII you have job boards, and so my understanding is that in the Zodiac Age, you can kind of pick,

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:38.000
I think in this one you get to do two different jobs at once. I think originally it was one, now it's two.

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:45.000
But it's like you're a little more limited in how you kind of craft your characters once you pick what job types you want them to be.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:51.000
But that also ensures that you don't fuck them up. So it's kind of a double-edged thing there.

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:58.000
So it's a little bit, I guess you could say it's like the definitive version of the game of sorts.

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:06.000
Because yes, they're also going back and doing the little tweaks here and there similar to what they did with Final Fantasy X to put this on the Playstation 4.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:12.000
Alright, anyhow, let's get to the mailbag. Every week you guys send us emails.

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:18.000
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com and we read your emails here live on the show.

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:22.000
And yet again, I don't have the damn music to put in the background here.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:30.000
So, oh wait, I found it. I found the song. We finally return to the regular mailbag music.

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
Yay!

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:38.000
Dark Sakura, dive in head first and find the email at participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:41.000
Just one.

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:46.000
Hey guys and gal, just wanted to respond to your topic from last week. I love my trophies.

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:47.000
Good.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:51.000
I take great pride in my trophies and my trophy count and my 10 platinums.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:57.000
Yeah, I could have gotten more but there are so many games to play. I don't buy a game and say, yes, I'm a platinum this one.

01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:04.000
For me, it's a show of accomplishment. I could have several friends on PSN that have the same game and maybe they'll have trophies that I don't.

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:10.000
I'll investigate to see if it's obtainable and I think that hunting and gathering is more important than the count.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:13.000
Dude, you got that trophy? I've been working on that bitch for a minute.

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:20.000
Seeing that someone loved the game so much that they felt compelled to acquire all the trophies isn't always a display of ego fapping.

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:26.000
It's a challenge. Hey, we both have the same game. I got this trophy. Can you? It also extends to the gameplay.

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:33.000
I can beat a game in no time but to get all the trophies and earn a platinum means that this was one of the best ever.

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:38.000
Some games, like The Walking Dead, will dish out a plat just for completing it.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:43.000
Most games will pit you against severe challenges or even optional bosses.

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:48.000
I personally won't add someone to my friends list with less than 900 trophies.

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:56.000
It's not an ego thing. It's just saying that I take my gaming very seriously and expect that the friends on my console of choice do the same.

01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:03.000
And I won't buy a game without trophies anymore. I spent $230 in the last few weeks on PSN because of their incredible sales.

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:09.000
I didn't buy a single game to earn trophies and I won't buy one without any. That is all.

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:15.000
Some people like to beat games on the hardest difficulty just for the street cred. With trophies, I have receipts with dates and times.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
Thank you for the great show, Recimo.

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:28.000
Okay, that's good. I'm glad that you like doing it that way. It's still completely inconsequential to me. I don't think the trophies are at all important.

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:42.000
Yeah, I respect this guy's ego and I get the whole, like, when achievements are hard to get, they can really be signs of dedication to the game or whatever.

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:48.000
Like, you know, I did work at getting the platinum trophy on Diablo 3 and that was a big accomplishment for me.

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:53.000
And why did I do it? Because I liked the game enough and it was a goal for me to go after. Cool!

01:47:53.000 --> 01:48:02.000
The thing for me is that it's so arbitrary. I'd rather have some kind of big reward for it. Other than that, I'm just doing it because I want to do it.

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:11.000
Right. And I seem to remember you did bring up the World of Warcraft you kind of liked because you got mounts and shit for doing things.

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:21.000
Yeah, it's like sometimes I would do things like if I was bored, like, supremely bored. But I more play the game for the enjoyment of the game.

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:33.000
I'm not... I'm competitive when it counts to be competitive. And when I am playing something that is for fun, unless it's a versus game, I'm not in any sort of competition.

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:42.000
I don't need to look at what other people have accomplished to gain a self... a feeling of enjoyment of it.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:49.000
I don't have to look at, oh, well, this person's done this well. I have to do the same. That's not important to me.

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:50.000
Right.

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:58.000
I... my enjoyment of a game has nothing to do with what other people think of it. Or what other people have done in it. You know.

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:07.000
I would have been curious though, you know, because remember this whole conversation started last week because we had that game on the... maybe I missed it in the email, but I don't think I heard it.

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:13.000
We had that game on the marketplace last week that was like, what, it was the 99 cent slide puzzle game that was like...

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:14.000
Yeah.

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:26.000
You get a trophy for pressing X and that whole thing. Like, that's kind of the thing. Remember, because that kind of started the whole conversation was, do trophies mean that much to you that you're going to pay 99 cents to just get trophies?

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:35.000
And I don't get that sense from this email, but don't forget that was also kind of part of what started that whole discussion was like, are trophies like that important where it's like you will pay to get them?

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:48.000
And I think we all kind of agree that was a little ridiculous. But I'm curious, would this guy have paid a dollar to get those trophies? I'm thinking no based on the email because there's no challenge. There's no reward there.

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:58.000
The thing that stuck out to me, and I'm really trying not to be my usual judgmental bitchy self over this, but picking your friends based on their accomplishments.

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:12.000
I'm a little worried about that too. That part kind of struck me as, ooh, now maybe if it's like randos on PlayStation 4 and you know if you want to add them or not, I get that. But like, what if it's somebody you know in real life?

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:24.000
Like, I'm not sure. Like, I'm kind of just hoping I'm misunderstanding that. Like, would you really like not, would you not put me on your friends list because I don't have 200 trophies? Well, I think I do, but...

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:29.000
I'm sure I've got, I don't even care how many I have. I could look.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:38.000
After all this time, I'm sure I have plenty of trophies. But let me, let me challenge this. I don't want to belabor this point too much, but let me challenge this.

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:47.000
What if you had a friend who couldn't afford a PlayStation until just now? So they haven't had the time to build up those trophies.

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:54.000
But they want to team up with you so they can try to get some. Because there are a lot of trophies for cooperative stuff.

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:59.000
I kind of don't think this guy would turn their back on that, but I don't know.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:02.000
You're not my friend anymore. You should have been on board with the...

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:14.000
I don't want to put words in dude's mouth either, but I just, you know, when I read that or when I saw that or heard that part of the email, I was a little bit like, ooh, but aren't there exceptions to every rule?

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:23.000
Well, it's just, I don't believe that there should be a condition like that unless it is like for random people.

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:32.000
But if it's the people that you know, you know, I would think that the point of being friends with them is to be friends with them and to play and enjoy games and talk to them.

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:45.000
I really, I hate this whole expectation that these achievements have had. It's a participation award. I mean, yeah, you can participate harder, I guess, and get new ones.

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:55.000
But I respect people who enjoy it. More power to you. But don't let that be the only reason for enjoying a game.

01:51:55.000 --> 01:52:06.000
Yeah. And this, just to be fair to all angles, because that's what I try to do here on this show where every gamer has a voice, to be fair to this guy's angle and going back to World of Warcraft for a minute.

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:20.000
I used to see this all the time in World of Warcraft where it was, we are going to do a farming run of X boss, but you need to link me your achievement to prove that you've done it because this isn't a learning group type of thing.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:33.000
I've seen that before. And so maybe if that's kind of like the approach here is that like, I don't want to play ranked matches in Overwatch with you unless you've kind of proven you've gotten certain landmarks in that game.

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:45.000
Like to that end, that's not unheard of. That isn't how I choose to do MMOs. I like to do learning stuff and all that, but that's cool if that's what you want to do.

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:51.000
I'm certainly not going to tell you how to play your stinking games. So, all right. Good email. Good discussion.

01:52:51.000 --> 01:53:03.000
JD in chat over at live.vognetware.com says, that must be why I love achievements. It's because I'm a millennial and I want my participation trophies. But he puts a little sarcastic face after that. He's not serious.

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
I want avocado toast.

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:17.000
Don't you? Sounds amazing. Actually, do you want to hear like the moment when it's like, am I really from California? I don't really care for avocados.

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
I just like avocados.

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:22.000
I like avocados and I'm not from California.

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:37.000
Is it one of those things like In-N-Out where the people not from here like it way more than the people who live here do? Although In-N-Out's not bad, but it's just, I'm always blown away how like anybody from out of the area is like, we have to go to In-N-Out. Oh my God.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:43.000
But then again, I used to be the exact same way about Dunkin Donuts until we finally got one here. So who am I to fucking talk, right?

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
Yeah, maybe donuts are kind of eh.

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:55.000
But I will say this. I don't hate, I don't have the raging hatred for avocado because I certainly don't dislike it. Like that's mayonnaise. Mayonnaise I fucking hate. Do not get that shit anywhere near me.

01:53:55.000 --> 01:54:01.000
But like a California roll has avocado in it. I'll eat that. That's fine. I don't care.

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:04.000
So what's your opinion on Miracle Whip then?

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:10.000
Straight from the seventh circle of hell and the innards of Satan's butthole.

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
But it's not mayonnaise really.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:15.000
But it's worse. It's imitation mayonnaise.

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:19.000
It's salad dressing and not even good.

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:27.000
I will say this. I only eat one brand of mayonnaise if it's not handmade. Just saying.

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:31.000
Oh yeah. I've heard of that too. Like there's like certain brands that people only have.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:38.000
I grew up on Hellmann's, which out here is best foods. And I've had like the olive oil one and it's okay.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:42.000
But if it's not made by hand then it has to be that one brand.

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:47.000
But isn't that weird? You can still get Hellmann's at Target even though it's all best foods here.

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
Well yeah you can get it at a grocery outlet too.

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:50.000
It's weird.

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:56.000
Actually when I see a Hellmann's one I have to buy it because it's that little bit of homesickness you know.

01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:01.000
And to be clear since now I've got everybody in chat talking about donuts. It's the coffee.

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:05.000
It was never about the donuts. Like don't get me wrong. I can't pass up one of those filled donuts.

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:12.000
But usually like here in California where Dunkin' is not nearly as prolific. We have like two in the entire Sacramento area.

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:16.000
It's the Ma and Pa donut shops are like everywhere and they're great.

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:22.000
Yeah the Dunkin' Donuts that's nearby to me. They're dead all the time.

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:23.000
Oh really?

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:24.000
I want one now.

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:32.000
Alright. Moving on. And then in chat. Crazy Chocobonator hands Rob Roberts a mayo and miracle whip sandwich.

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:39.000
If you want to wear that sandwich then that would be a smart thing to do. But if you don't I would advise against that.

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:44.000
Like I always have friends that are like oh I'm going to get you a jar of mayonnaise for birthday as a joke.

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:49.000
I'm like okay first of all jokes are funny. Second of all do you want to wear that?

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:54.000
Like I fucking hate mayonnaise. It is gross.

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
I also like Kewpie mayonnaise.

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:57.000
Really?

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:58.000
The Japanese one.

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
But I like it for a topping on things.

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:05.000
And oh my god. Here's my biggest pet peeve. I went into a restaurant once. I'm like does this have mayonnaise on it?

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:08.000
And they're like no it's a garlic aioli. And I'm like that's fucking mayonnaise.

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:13.000
I know your fucking code languages to make basic ingredients sound fancy.

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:16.000
Anyway.

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:19.000
Garlic mayolis.

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:24.000
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says I actually don't get mayo on my stuff when I'm around Rob.

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:29.000
I don't care. Other people can have it on a sandwich or whatever you want to do.

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:33.000
Alan likes it. He fucking makes me watch him buy it at the store.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:39.000
But love makes you do crazy things so I allow him to buy the mayonnaise.

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:42.000
I just say put it in the little part in the fridge where I don't have to look at it.

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:43.000
Alright.

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:48.000
Let's move on. It's a video game show. Not a what food do I hate show. Loki.

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:54.000
So there's a game that's called Intelligent Design and Evolutionary Sandbox.

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:59.000
And apparently there's still one achievement that no one has been able to crack yet.

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:04.000
That one trophy. So the final Steam achievement is called Code Breaker.

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:12.000
And what Code Breaker is it's basically a code that they have to solve in order to get this last achievement.

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:15.000
And if they get the last achievement what do they get as a reward?

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:20.000
Not just the trophy but they get the source code released for the game.

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:25.000
So the game itself is more of like kind of designing your own ecosystem on a barren planet.

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:31.000
And what the creator said is now the source code is not going to necessarily allow them to,

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:35.000
you know, it won't answer all the questions on how to build the perfect ecosystem.

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:42.000
But it will give them something else to explore which is what my game is all about.

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:50.000
And so, you know, basically kind of hinting at, you know, here's how you might be able to get some tips to make it better.

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:51.000
I don't know.

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:54.000
But I think it's kind of neat though that they're offering up the source code.

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
But yeah, no one's really figured it out yet.

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:59.000
There's little bits of hints coming through different parts of the game.

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:08.000
So they have like these kind of like wormhole portal things that are kind of spitting out some characters that are part of this.

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
But no one's seen the crack yet.

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:12.000
It's neat.

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:16.000
Good way to kind of get that viral buzz on the game, I guess.

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:19.000
Especially when sometimes it's hard to be noticed on Steam.

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
Like this might be a good way to do it.

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:26.000
I mean, it's probably not incentive for you, Loki, because you're not playing this game.

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:29.000
But do you kind of get where people might find incentive in that?

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:30.000
Yeah, I mean, definitely.

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:38.000
I mean, there was like I remember the whole Chiliad stuff with Grand Theft Auto that people were kind of searching for Easter eggs with that and all sorts of cryptography stuff with that.

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:47.000
And then come to find out there's really nothing there and their Easter egg mission that they have now is kind of crap.

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:50.000
Which, by the way, they finally figured out how to actually unlock that mission.

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:57.000
So you have to do 600 gun running missions and then you trigger a gun running mission at night.

01:58:57.000 --> 01:59:01.000
And if you do it at the right time, you get that Easter egg one.

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000
But that's kind of lame.

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000
It's not a jet pack.

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:09.000
Alright, well let's talk about Rayman.

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
But not a new Rayman game.

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000
An old Rayman game.

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:14.000
A very old Rayman game.

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:20.000
There was actually a Rayman Super Nintendo version that was under development and there was even a prototype demo.

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:24.000
That was put online by a developer at Lizardcube.

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:27.000
And you can actually download this.

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:28.000
So it was pretty cool.

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
Twitter user Oakornut.

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:31.000
I hope I said that right.

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:33.000
Actually put that up.

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:37.000
He's the developer at Lizardcube that put that up on Dropbox and you can check that out.

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:41.000
Because, you know, this is years old and it's not like anybody's going to lose money off this.

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:42.000
So there you go.

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:47.000
Previously there were images on Twitter posted when the prototype was found to still be working.

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.000
So if you want to check that out, you can.

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:53.000
Although keep in mind because it is a prototype, it's not going to be perfect.

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:56.000
If it was perfect, they would have released the damn thing.

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:57.000
But they didn't.

01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:00.000
JD in chat says, Rayman for Super Nintendo Mini.

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:02.000
Wouldn't that be something?

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:07.000
But I guess one unfinished game that they actually went back and finished still blows my mind.

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:08.000
I guess that's enough.

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:10.000
Alright, moving on.

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:11.000
Dark Sakura.

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:21.000
Well, there is a book coming out that is honoring a phenomenon that we don't really see so much anymore.

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:28.000
But it's the bad video game translation book.

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:34.000
It's called This Be Book Bad Translation Video Games.

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:35.000
That's awesome.

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:41.000
And like one of the pictures in there is like, you are a sucking baby.

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:49.000
And of course we're going to have, you know, probably the all your base and all that.

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000
But it feels like it's inspired by that.

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000
Here is a graveyard of you.

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:59.000
So I don't know. I kind of have to have this book now.

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:05.000
Yeah, I was looking at some of the little screenshots that, you know, the demo pages they have out there.

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:06.000
It looks pretty funny.

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:07.000
Apparently it's $15.

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:10.000
That's a fun little coffee table book for a nerd.

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:12.000
I like it.

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:15.000
I think it would be fun. Yeah, I might have to pick this up.

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:19.000
I'll link it in the chat room.

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:23.000
Kasa Ninchat says, please tell me they have Harvest Moon screenshots.

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:26.000
I'm sure any of the legendary stuff is in there.

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:30.000
S2100 Matt says, all your base are belong to us has to be in it.

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
Oh yeah, that's one of the big pictures.

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:35.000
All right.

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
Moving on, just a couple more stories for you guys.

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:39.000
Then we're going to open up the Skype line.

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:40.000
See if you guys have anything to say.

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:43.000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:44.000
But first, Loki.

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:51.000
All right, so this is a pretty cool follow up to something we had talked about just a few weeks ago.

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:59.000
So remember the whole thing with Rockstar Games kind of banning modding tools for the single player and stuff like that?

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:00.000
I do.

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:01.000
I do.

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:02.000
With Open 4?

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:03.000
Well, Open 4 is back.

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000
So they re-enabled the downloads on it.

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:09.000
They did put out a release talking about, you know, kind of what's going on.

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:25.000
The only thing that isn't going to be released though is the fact that they were working on that kind of total conversion where they were adding the Liberty City map into the Grand Theft Auto 5 map.

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:33.000
And of course because that does violate their modding policy now, that unfortunately is not something that they're going to be continuing forward with.

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000
But the development of Open 4 will continue though.

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:38.000
So that is good to finally get this whole thing resolved.

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
So we've kind of met halfway I guess.

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:41.000
Yes.

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:42.000
Which is fine.

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:43.000
All right.

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
How about Grand Theft Auto 6?

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000
Is it time to start talking Grand Theft Auto 6?

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:48.000
Not yet, probably.

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:49.000
No?

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000
I guess we've got to get past Red Dead Redemption 2 first, huh?

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000
Before we can talk about that.

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:54.000
All right.

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:59.000
Well, one more story for you guys tonight, our last official story tonight before we get to the Skype line.

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:05.000
There is a brand new rhythm and dance arcade game being released by Konami.

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:06.000
That's right.

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:12.000
Apparently is being location tested or demoed at a round one in Senashime.

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000
I hope I said that right.

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:23.000
That is apparently also a location where a lot of dance evolution players, which was, what was that Kinect game that came out that was Konami.

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000
It's almost just like that in the arcade.

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.000
Somebody in the chat will remember.

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:30.000
But anyway, Stepstar is the new game.

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:36.000
And Stepstar is, it's interesting because the dance pad is like just one big mat.

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
It's almost like one big kind of pad on the ground.

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
It's not split up like DDR was.

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:43.000
But in this game, there are four types of notes or steps.

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:48.000
There's step, long, jump, and crouch squat down.

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:54.000
Because I guess this measures you not just by the dance pad but also by a camera that is watching you.

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000
Thank you MXC Dance Masters.

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:57.000
I think that was it.

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000
That is the name of that game I was thinking of.

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:04.000
Anyway, the interesting thing about this game though, it's not a Bamani title.

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:07.000
The Bamani logo is not on the flyers.

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000
It's not showing up on the cabinet either.

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:12.000
So apparently, even though it's a dance game, it's not a Bamani game.

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:17.000
So after all these years everybody, confirmed, Bamani is dead.

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000
Thank you, goodnight.

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:22.000
Alright, I'm just teasing.

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
Put down your pitchforks and torches.

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
Alright, but anyway.

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:27.000
I just sighed, that's all.

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:35.000
Part of what I think is interesting about this game is that you can actually, I guess the game will actually make a YouTube for you.

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:41.000
So you can automatically upload it to YouTube because social sharing is the big thing we do now, right?

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:49.000
So the gameplay is recorded and then you can upload it to YouTube via the game's website and a four digit pin that you use.

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:53.000
And just so you get a sense of what the songs in the game sound like, you have these guys.

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:58.000
This is a cute song.

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:02.000
It sounds a little like something out of Hatsune Miku, but I like it.

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:06.000
These guys are getting into it too.

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:11.000
Alright, anyway, this makes for horrible radio, but that's one of the songs there is in Stepstar on the location test.

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.000
So there you go.

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:17.000
You can check that out if you live in Japan, otherwise you'll have to wait.

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:25.000
But the good news is if it's being tested at a round one, maybe it'll make the round ones over here for those of you guys that happen to live near one.

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:28.000
Which it seems like there are more and more of those round ones popping up.

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:32.000
So that hopefully will be good news for you music game fans.

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:35.000
But not Bimani fans because remember, this isn't a Bimani game.

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:36.000
Alright.

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:37.000
Bimani is dead.

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:39.000
Long live Bimani.

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:42.000
Alright, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:46.000
If you want to give us a call, the Skype line is open now.

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:50.000
And while we wait for some calls, Loki, I want to check in and see if you have any last minute stories.

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:55.000
Well, one thing we didn't talk about this week, which is it's drama, unfortunately.

02:05:55.000 --> 02:06:02.000
So there is this whole controversy going on around this woman named Alex Mauer.

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:07.000
And she was someone that worked on a game called Star Maser.

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:14.000
And she's been DMCA copyright claiming a bunch of videos that have Star Maser music in them because...

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:18.000
This has been going on for a couple of weeks. Somebody tweeted this at me.

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:21.000
Because you know we had those Star Maser guys on the show a while ago.

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:22.000
So anyway, sorry.

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
But yeah, this has been going on for a few weeks now.

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
But go ahead. I don't want to cut you off.

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:30.000
Anyways, so basically there's a whole...

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:37.000
Lawsuit is being filed against her now because she was a contractor and they had it in their contract.

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:41.000
I mean, as it is when you're doing contract work, anything you produce in that contract,

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:47.000
unless it's specifically stated there, is whoever you're working for, that's their copyright.

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:50.000
So you don't own that anymore. But she feels that she does.

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000
And so she's claiming against them.

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:59.000
And now even other companies like Adult Swim Games, Turner Broadcasting, she filed a claim against them.

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:03.000
Like all sorts of crazy shit. And it's just not going to work out too well for her.

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:10.000
Here's the thing. This is a really tricky issue and it's one that I don't want to really stick my nose in too far.

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:18.000
But I also kind of get, like it sounds like the StarMazer team kind of did a spinoff or like a side game that was...

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:22.000
And I forget the name of it or whatever, but apparently some of this stuff was used there too.

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:23.000
And so that's...

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.000
No, it wasn't even that because...

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:26.000
That's what it was.

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:30.000
No, it's a bunch of stuff. And she felt that she was due some money regarding this.

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:33.000
But she doesn't have the rights to this stuff.

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:37.000
And now thankfully a lot of the videos are coming back from their claim status on there.

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:40.000
Like I said, there is a lawsuit now being filed against her.

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:47.000
She's filed death threats, or she's made death threats against people, sent emails, threatened to kill herself.

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:53.000
It's just a big, huge mess. It's just... it's bad.

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:55.000
But hopefully...

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.000
They thought that she was getting the help that she needed.

02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:59.000
I hope that she gets some guidance with that.

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:01.000
But she's just kind of doubling down.

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:05.000
Going after the users, there's not going to... like the YouTubers and stuff, there's not...

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:07.000
If she has an issue with Starbazer, I'm not going to...

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:08.000
Well, it wasn't even because...

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:11.000
I don't know if she... I don't know all sides of the story.

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.000
So again, I'm not going to try to stick my nose in it.

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.000
But if she has a legitimate claim against her...

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:19.000
Because at face value, if she was told this is going to be for one game,

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:21.000
and then all of a sudden now it's two games,

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:24.000
I can sort of see where there is concern.

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:27.000
But that's between her and those guys,

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
and they need to work it out with their lives and all this stuff.

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:32.000
Dragging all these other fucking people on YouTube and stuff, no winners there.

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:35.000
The whole reason she was doing that is because she was trying to get, you know,

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:40.000
basically taking it on the YouTubers so that the company gets attention from it.

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
You know, like the YouTubers are supposed to get mad.

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:45.000
Well that backfired spectacularly on her, didn't it?

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:46.000
It was ridiculous.

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:52.000
But at the same time, the psychological stuff that can come with that can really...

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.000
Like the Internet's a fucking savage place sometimes.

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000
Right, and then she basically doesn't own this music,

02:08:56.000 --> 02:09:01.000
and she's literally sometimes claiming three... making three claims against a channel.

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000
That knocks a channel. That's bi. Your channel's gone.

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.000
Yeah, at that point.

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:08.000
But this is also something where, again, I blame YouTube.

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:14.000
This is also on YouTube for not being content creator friendly.

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:18.000
Yet, it continues to be one of the only options out there.

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
Anyway, this issue's a fucking mess.

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000
That's all I have to say.

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000
Dungeon Buster's been educated on this issue,

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:27.000
so I just want to read this in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:28.000
Dungeon Buster says,

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:29.000
Dungeon Buster says,

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.000
Star Maser the game is still being made,

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.000
but there's a spin-off game called Star Maser DSP.

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:34.000
That was it.

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000
That some backers are upset about because they're asking,

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
why are they working on that instead of the main game?

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:42.000
The devs have also been bad at communicating updates to the main project.

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000
The last huge update was last November.

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:47.000
And then, you know, I have to admit,

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:51.000
I really get irked at some of these stories

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:54.000
because then I go, well, you know, we had them on our show,

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000
and we backed the project and all that stuff,

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:59.000
so I really, I'm rooting for them, and I want to see them succeed,

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:02.000
but it also kind of doesn't look great on us

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000
when we brought on these projects and hyped them up,

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:05.000
and they're not...

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:06.000
But how are we supposed to know?

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:07.000
Yeah, we don't.

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:09.000
But it, unfortunately, it also,

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:11.000
it just makes me leery of Kickstarters in the future.

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:12.000
You know what I mean?

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:13.000
Yeah.

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.000
So it's kind of, I don't know.

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:16.000
Anyway, just throwing that out there.

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:19.000
Anyway, if anyone from that team happens to be listening,

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000
or if this composer happens to be listening,

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:24.000
open door, if y'all want to come on the show and talk about it.

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:25.000
Open door.

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:26.000
Every gamer gets a voice.

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000
So, all right.

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:29.000
Yeah, and Dutch Ambassador says it's not your fault.

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:30.000
There's no way to tell.

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000
No, I know that, but at the same time.

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:33.000
At the same time, you know.

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:35.000
All right, let's go to the phones.

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:36.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:37.000
Who's this?

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.000
Hey, this is Raging Nader.

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:40.000
Hey, Raging Nader.

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:41.000
What's on your mind, buddy?

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:43.000
Not a whole lot.

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:50.000
This call is semi-related to the email that I sent in last week.

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:51.000
Wait a minute.

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000
I have to ask a question because you're on video on Skype,

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:54.000
and I know this isn't great radio,

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:57.000
but are we being projected on a screen behind you?

02:10:57.000 --> 02:11:00.000
Is that like your computer on a projector?

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
Yeah, yeah.

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:05.000
But you watch a lot of movies on Steam and all that stuff,

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.000
so that makes sense.

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:09.000
You might have a projector set up for that.

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:13.000
Yeah, well, I play a lot of my DVDs and whatnot,

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:18.000
and my projector, and my iTunes content, so on and so forth, so.

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:19.000
All right.

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:20.000
Sorry, I had to be nosy and ask,

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000
but you said you had to follow up to last week's email.

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:23.000
Yeah.

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:27.000
Now, just to refresh everyone's memory,

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:32.000
one thing I brought up was the Super Nintendo Mini,

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:35.000
or whatever the official name is,

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:44.000
and I gave an anecdote as to my buying the Super Nintendo way back in the day,

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:48.000
so on and so forth, and on that note,

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:51.000
I want to ask you two related questions.

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:58.000
Now, whenever the three of you bought your systems,

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.000
especially way back in the day,

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:05.000
with your limited funds through babysitting or paper routes or whatever,

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:09.000
and considering how expensive some of the games could be,

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:12.000
especially for 20 years ago or plus,

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:22.000
what kind of, for lack of a better term, research did the three of you do,

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:29.000
especially considering that they really have the internet as we know it today?

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:30.000
Okay.

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:31.000
I like this question.

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:35.000
So, 20 years ago, what influenced your game buying decisions,

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:39.000
because there was no internet, there was no Metacritic.

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:42.000
What was it 20 years ago?

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:45.000
Well, I'd subscribe to magazines and see what looks nice,

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:49.000
and then, of course, 20 years ago, we had the whole video and game rental scene,

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000
so we didn't have to make a purchase.

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:53.000
You could just rent it and see if it's something you like,

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:55.000
or play it at a friend's house.

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:56.000
Jamie?

02:12:56.000 --> 02:13:00.000
It was, oh, I like this in the arcade.

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:01.000
Oh, it's coming out.

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:04.000
When it was Street Fighter II and Mortal Kombat?

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:05.000
Absolutely.

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:07.000
Well, and pretty much all I played was RPG and fighting games,

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:10.000
and lots and lots and lots of Kirby's Avalanche.

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:14.000
Yeah, I would say it's kind of like half what Loki said

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:20.000
and half like magazines like GamePro, EGM, and all that.

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:23.000
That was kind of what we had instead of the internet then,

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:25.000
so that was definitely what went into it.

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:26.000
Yeah.

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:34.000
At least for me, it's a lot of what you're saying, in my case.

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:39.000
I read, for a number of years, I did read Nintendo Power,

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:45.000
but I kind of put that, by the way, because I kind of figured,

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:48.000
hey, this magazine is put up on Nintendo themselves.

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:51.000
This magazine is basically over-glorified ads.

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:55.000
Obviously, they're not going to say, hey, our games suck.

02:13:55.000 --> 02:14:01.000
So I started reading other magazines like GamePro, like you mentioned, and whatnot.

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:05.000
Then on top of that, I don't know if you remember,

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:12.000
there was a GamePro TV that had a brief run on there.

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
I saw the VOs on there.

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:18.000
That's how I discovered Castlevania IV.

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:26.000
And then, of course, some other kids in the neighborhood had such-and-such games on such-and-such systems.

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
That's how I checked it out.

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:33.000
And that's how I beat a lot of my decisions.

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:39.000
Yeah. A lot of times, TV footage and video stuff, like what little did get to TV,

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:43.000
was huge influencers on the decision, for sure.

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:44.000
Yeah.

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:51.000
As for my second question, which kind of relates to my previous question,

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:59.000
for the longest time, I personally can say that I was a diehard Nintendo fanboy.

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:05.000
You know, I had the original Nintendo, the Super Nintendo,

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:11.000
and I even got the N64 in the spring of 1997.

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:19.000
And right around the time that I was going to my local Toys R Us to buy the N64,

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:27.000
I saw the PlayStation 1 at a demo kiosk with one of those jam packs that they had.

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:34.000
Now, I honestly, at the time when Nintendo Fanboy was a little conflicted,

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:37.000
because on one hand, I said to myself,

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:42.000
wow, these games out there on the jam pack look awesome.

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:48.000
I want to play them, you know, but at the same time as being a Nintendo fanboy,

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:53.000
I felt almost like, you know, for lack of a better term, traitorous.

02:15:53.000 --> 02:16:02.000
You know, hey, oh my God, am I actually considered by a competitor's system?

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:08.000
Yeah, but that's a lot of ridiculous shit that the advertising campaigns put on our head and all that stuff, you know.

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:17.000
Yeah. So that being said, well, ultimately, yeah, I did get the PlayStation 1 a few weeks later,

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:31.000
but all that being said, I would like to ask, have you ever had conflicting emotions about buying such a system for similar reasons?

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:35.000
No, not me. I'll open this up to the co-host. No, never me.

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:40.000
But it was just the reality was I didn't, you know, if I had had the money, I would have bought them all.

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:44.000
But I never had that kind of money, so you had to make a choice.

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:51.000
And usually those choices were heavily influenced by, you know, what did my friends have and, you know, what was available in that regard.

02:16:51.000 --> 02:17:00.000
But I, no, no, I really wouldn't buy stuff out of loyalty. Shit, I wish at a young age I'd been able to afford a Neo Geo.

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:08.000
I remember renting a Neo Geo. You could rent the whole damn system in like a game or two for like 15 bucks for a few days.

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:13.000
And I remember renting Fatal Fury Special so I could play that on Neo Geo.

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:18.000
Because, yeah, oh man, that was, I was like, I was like, I had the fucking arcade in my house. It was awesome.

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000
We might be selling ours.

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:21.000
Really?

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:25.000
Yep. We haven't played it a whole lot and that'd give us a few grand.

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:28.000
No, yeah, I guess so. I guess, yeah, those things are worth a lot.

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000
So, all right.

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:31.000
Yeah.

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:34.000
Rage Nator, I'm gonna let you go so we can try to squeeze some more calls, but good questions tonight. Take care, buddy.

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:35.000
Sure.

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:36.000
All right.

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:37.000
All right, have a nice night.

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:38.000
Bye.

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:44.000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype. If you want to give us a call, we'll leave it open for just a couple more minutes here.

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:50.000
But if you are on the fence on if you should call or not, you should probably call right now because we might close it up soon.

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:54.000
Let me check in with Loki. Any other last minute stories that we have?

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:58.000
No, not really.

02:17:58.000 --> 02:17:59.000
Well, gee.

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:00.000
All right.

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000
Sorry.

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
What do you want? I mean.

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:09.000
Yeah, I know. I know. Well, I'm just trying to buy some time. We wait for another call here.

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:13.000
Any games y'all are planning to play this week?

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.000
Fives of 12 for me.

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:22.000
I'm still working on actually starting programming this game.

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:26.000
But it's not for, you know, it hasn't been completely a waste of time.

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:32.000
So I like I've been gathering other things. I've been trying to figure out like the storyline or whatever for the game.

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:39.000
I'm going to be working on and also finding music and that they're like stylistic assets and stuff that I kind of want to base.

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:45.000
You know, like kind of like I guess like a board, if you will, of like, OK, I kind of like the way this looks.

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:48.000
I want to kind of use as like an inspiration board.

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:53.000
There you go. And so, yeah, we just kind of do that stuff.

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:55.000
What about you, Jimmy?

02:18:55.000 --> 02:19:01.000
I I actually finished up writing. I was considering starting my book.

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:07.000
Oh, I've been world building so much. I might just get it going. But talking shit, naming names by Jamie.

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:14.000
No. But other than that, I'm I still got Ultra Despair Girls to get started on.

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:18.000
And I've been enjoying Xenoverse two so much. I don't really want to play anything else.

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:22.000
All right. Well, the phone lines look like they're slowing down.

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:28.000
So I think that means it's time to close them up. But thank you, guys, who did call in.

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:32.000
Thanks, Regenator. Thanks for the emails, of course, and all the chat comments tonight.

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:37.000
If you think of something after the fact, you can always give us a shout on Twitter at OLR.

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:40.000
You can leave us a comment over at VOG Network dot com or talk to us throughout the week,

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:45.000
either in our IRC channel at VOG Network or on the new Discord.

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:50.000
Either way would be fantastic. But I think it is that part of the show where we're going to wrap things up.

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:53.000
So I want to thank you guys, as always, for listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:55.000
And if you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio,

02:19:55.000 --> 02:20:01.000
please remember to leave a five star review where you found this show either on iTunes or Google Play.

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:06.000
And of course, we also say tell a friend about the show. Help us spread the word where every gamer has a voice.

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:11.000
We got to have all the gamer voices here to air them. So word of mouth goes a very, very, very long way.

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:16.000
We always appreciate it. So I guess we will close it up tonight by getting everybody's final thoughts.

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:21.000
Loki, your final thought tonight. So I was looking in chat and they were talking about the Oton.

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:26.000
I haven't even figured. I didn't remember if they even launched the campaign for that,

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:30.000
because I know that dude was talking about the Oton for like the longest time.

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:37.000
And they were like bouncing between like Kickstarter and Indie.

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:42.000
Was it IndieGoGo or whatever it was? I don't remember. But like.

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:47.000
Yeah, that was a shit show. There was no way that was going to happen.

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:53.000
That's it. And Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight. I wish I had a quesadilla.

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:59.000
Mmm. Cheese and tortillas. I just want the cheese, really. It's the melted cheese that's the best part.

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:03.000
The tortilla is just a vehicle for deliverance of said cheese.

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:10.000
And that reminds me, I did see, was it that the tease video that Oton Brown's bringing good eats back, which is fantastic.

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:15.000
OK. How about unwrapped with Mark Summers? That was my favorite. No.

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:19.000
Yeah, I'd go for that. All right. All right.

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:22.000
That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:26.000
My final thought tonight would be I want to get to my coloring book this week.

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:29.000
I saw my Golden Girls coloring book. I need to get to this week. Your pencils arrived at my house.

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:33.000
Yeah. I forgot to bring them. All right. That's OK. That means you have to come over.

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:38.000
Well, isn't it a nice thing that I have to go drop you off anyway? So that's right.

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:42.000
OK. There we go. All right. So that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:45.000
Have a great night, everybody. We'll see you next time. Bye.

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:15.000
Radio or Vogue Network, but you know, they were all still true.

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:18.000
See you next week.

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:40.000
You
