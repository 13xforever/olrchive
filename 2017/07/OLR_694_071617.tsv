24000	27000	right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	37000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice
37000	42000	it's Orange Lounge Radio live tonight on July the 16th of 2017
42000	48000	episode number 694 of our show. My name is Rob Roberts
48000	54000	here with you every week with my co-hosts right over there say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Sommers
54000	59000	Hello, hi. Hi, how are you? I'm very full. Yes, do you have a little lunch for the show?
59000	66000	It's more like a dinner with the time of this show. I had my frappuccino
66000	71000	and my something's been upset since last night. So because Dan took me to Chevy's and
71000	76000	Peppers. Oh, nice. Yeah. So yeah,
76000	81000	otherwise okay. Otherwise hanging in there. That's good. I saw you're still in the boot with
81000	86000	your cast but you said something about this is your third boot. This is my third boot. The second one
86000	91000	because not this past Friday but the one before that I got my second change and
91000	96000	they made it way too thin and it started to apparently I kick a lot in my sleep
96000	101000	and the thing split because I can apparently kick
101000	106000	fiberglass apart. Wow. So they made it triple thick and
106000	111000	this one's lasting and it's harder to walk in but it'll only
111000	116000	it's coming off on the 25th. So is that a sugar thing? Like if you have sugar before bed because
116000	121000	because Alan says it on the is so embarrassing but I'm going to tell it anyway. So
121000	126000	like sometimes we'll have like Slurpees for 7-Eleven because we live right in Iran and Slurpees are really good and
126000	131000	they have this cotton candy Slurpee right now. So like maybe we don't do it every day but maybe like once a week I'll have a Slurpee and sometimes I'm
131000	136000	stupid and I have it right before bed and Alan says if I do that it's like I will kick
136000	141000	kick kick kick like in my sleep. Like it's really bad and he says it's the sugar's fault. I just
141000	146000	do that anyway. Oh. Are you doing Kung Fu in your sleep? I'm a very active
146000	151000	dreamer apparently. I see. I see. So kicking lots of MRAs in your sleep. I've fallen out of bed
151000	156000	twice with this on. I wish I were kidding but I'm not. I hit my head pretty
156000	161000	hard the first time. Yikes. Well I'm glad you're okay. All things considered. Thank you. All right. But yeah the boot.
161000	166000	I'm ready for it to go. All right. How much longer? 25th. Oh that's not too bad.
166000	171000	So next Sunday will be my last Sunday with it on. Nice. All right. Cool cool. Well also say hello to tech master
171000	176000	Loki. Hello. Hi Loki. How are you? I'm also full. Yeah. Are you doing your whole
176000	181000	dozen breadsticks and all that? Yeah it's just because of the breadsticks size
182000	187000	whoever's making these breadsticks needs a lesson. They're doing it wrong because I see I used to make these
187000	192000	breadsticks and they're not supposed to be this large because it's too much dough. The ratio
192000	197000	of the dough to everything else is way off and I can tell just by
197000	202000	looking at it it's like okay some dumbass is using the wrong dough for this shit.
202000	207000	But whatever. So that's why like because the one time I get six
207000	212000	is when they're going to fuck it make it right and it's going to be too little. So whatever
212000	216000	this way I can share. So she's had three three
216000	221000	new boots boots put on. So I guess this is a reboot.
221000	226000	Did you did you think of that joke in all the minutes before our tonight. No just like a few seconds.
226000	231000	I see. And I'm pretty sure that you know you're not like you know kicking because the sugar you're just chasing
231000	236000	the mailman. So it's fine. I'm chasing what the mailman
237000	242000	makes sense. You think when I when I'm asleep I dream I'm a dog. Well if I
242000	247000	did dream I was a dog I'd be a corgi because they're so cute and I want to belong to the queen of England.
247000	252000	I saw it was at Flocko Jones the other day. Yeah he was talking about like I was telling him like the other day I
252000	257000	was so tired I was falling asleep in my dream like in my dream I'm like man I want to just like fall
257000	262000	asleep right now. You dreamt about taking a nap. I dreamt about taking a nap like I'm like I want to take another nap.
262000	267000	It's like sleep ception there. But he's like yeah the other day I had a dream where I was a cat and I was laying on the bed.
267000	273000	I'm like was it like from your perspective as a cat or were you just like looking at a cat on a bed.
273000	278000	And it was like I don't know. It was just a funny conversation. Dreams are weird man.
278000	285000	They are. All right. Games right. It is a video game show believe it or not. You know but I'm gonna be real with you all this week.
285000	290000	It was a slow. It was a slow news week this week. I mean there's some things about this. It's kind of a slower week.
290000	297000	I guess with it being summertime and people taking their summer vacations and it's relatively E3 after E3.
297000	301000	Yeah E3 you know everybody kind of said everything they had to say a month ago so it's slowing down a bit.
301000	309000	So tangents they're inevitable. But talking about games a little bit. Obviously we have this ongoing saga here on OLR about Loki develops his own game.
309000	315000	And there's been a few weeks where you're kind of like yeah I've been too busy. Yeah I have ideas but you said you worked on your game this week.
315000	319000	A little bit yeah. This is not the car game though. No this is not the car game. We need to let the car go.
319000	324000	This is casually. Well I haven't given up on that. It's just I want to do something different with it.
324000	329000	And even my son the other day he's like are you going to work on the car game anymore? I'm like god damn it.
329000	337000	Aww good job. We need to get the dark soccer. We need to get that kid a cookie. Now the kids getting on Loki about the game.
338000	343000	Well no I'm not working on it right now. I'm working on something else you know.
343000	356000	But anyways so like I you know I was working on this like I don't even know if I'm like really entering the game jam because like I've been like I said I've been really tired like as I mentioned I've had a dream where I was dream about sleeping some more.
356000	366000	So I've been like exhausted and I've tried working on it and actually I've had a few days where it's been like I had a moment and I'm able to just like kind of focus and actually work on stuff and so I did.
366000	387000	I have I've been trying to you know build out the basic stuff for like a clicker game. So I have like the thing that I worked on a little bit was actually getting the amounts to display correctly because you know you're clicking on stuff and you can't really just have a number increment up.
387000	402000	You know you have to actually do some formatting otherwise get that weird scientific notation at the end. Yeah which some people might not want. So you have to like specify formatting and stuff to put all the weird names and stuff after it or the abbreviations everything so I actually built that.
402000	415000	And then I'm building something else to read an Internet clock so that I can do that. And then you know just some basic button stuff for like OK you can purchase this and the increments up each level.
415000	444000	You say but stuff. Oh button button button stuff. Yeah. But in stuff. Button stuff. Yes. So what kind of game like the framework in place and then I can work on the actual theme I want to do with it afterwards I have ideas but it's like I've been really busy at work so I don't have time to like sit there like in downtime to just kind of think of stuff and you know mock stuff outside and work on it at home.
444000	463000	And so when I get home it's like OK what do I need to make. And like you know it takes me a while to get there but I've been trying just I'm very tired. The problem is I stay up too late because I'm tired and I want to work on something and I get frustrated so I end up staying up too late which makes me tired the next day. It's an endless cycle.
464000	476000	I see. Yeah. No I know how it is. I stay up until two in the morning and then the next day I'm like boy I'm tired. I should take a nap. So I take a nap and then I can't get to sleep when I should be going to sleep so I stay up till two in the morning. I totally get it. It's a cycle. Yeah it is a cycle. I understand.
477000	487000	Hey we've got a live chat room of course. We do tape live every Sunday night at the voice geek network of vog network dot com six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
487000	503000	And if you want to join us live live dot vog network dot com and MXC unfortunately in chat reminding us RIP George Romero. Yeah that that just happened earlier today. George Romero who made Night of the Living Dead all those you know super famous zombie movies passed away today.
503000	516000	And I know a lot of my friends are bummed about that because you know I work a lot with the horror film fest here in SAC because they do the cult movie extension with Rocky or and everything. So I know a lot of people are really sad about that and obviously the guy you know I may not be super into scary horror movies.
516000	529000	But I I recognize this guy for making all those awesome movies. But yeah well and and to be fair it's it's a gaming show tying it to games a little bit a game like Dead Rising was straight up Night of the Living Dead.
530000	542000	Yeah. I mean like there's so many games that his movies have inspired. You know I mean it is huge. It is horrible now that he's passed. Who's going to make the zombie movies and or games now. I mean there literally is no one filling that void.
542000	554000	Well he obviously beg to differ. Have you seen Train to Busan. I think that's the joke. It was a joke. Yes I don't know the end saying that there's a lot of zombie movies and or games out there in the market.
554000	568000	Loki you don't understand George Romero now becomes a zombie. We can only hope and he ironically starts a zombie apocalypse. I mean it's the irony and I'm not trying to be an asshole I promise but sometimes you have to see the light hearted things.
568000	580000	I think he would be proud if he was actually proud. I think he'd be excited that people were talking about how to turn him into a zombie. I think so. Also also passed away today.
580000	595000	Martin Landau which I must admit was one of those things where when I heard that I was like didn't that happen two years ago. I felt horrible but that was another best supporting actor Oscar winner that I remember from years ago that passed away a couple years ago.
595000	607000	But no Martin Landau actually he passed today. So that's a bummer too. I can't think of anything directly involving games with him. I think he's more of like a character actor from a lot of movies and people remember Ed Wood was probably one of his more famous roles.
607000	619000	He got nominated for all those Oscars for so yeah kind of kind of feeling feeling some loss in Hollywood today and of course do y'all buy into that superstition that things come in threes.
619000	628000	Well Stan Lee's getting old. No no bite your tongue. Actually that is kind of bad because his wife just died. Shame on you Loki shame.
629000	641000	Did Zsa Zsa Gabor finally pass. Did that finally happen an age ago. Oh really. Because that's that's why I would always throw out there when it's like we're looking for a third. That was kind of like your safe non offensive answer was Zsa Zsa Gabor.
641000	646000	But now. Shit I need somebody new now. Take a Kardashian.
646000	658000	I mean they've got a lot of them. Come on. They're not going to miss one of them. Who's she died on December 18th last year. Who's who's like who's like ninety nine in Hollywood right now.
658000	665000	Stanley. No no no Stanley's early 90s and he's he's he's the national treasure. I'm not even going to joke about it.
665000	675000	Dick Van Dyke. As Sasha Velour says don't joke about that. Dick Van. Dick Van Dyke is in his late 90s. Oh oh what about Jerry Lewis.
675000	685000	Is Jerry Lewis still alive. We're looking at that right now. Oh how Jerry Lewis is still alive. OK Jerry I would be ninety nine.
685000	694000	OK. There it is. Jerry sorry. Ninety one. Oh speaking to me. I just had my answer. Everyone's seen Betty White which house. No no.
694000	703000	First of all this is a scolding for me to the chat room. You don't you don't see me right now but I'm wagging my finger you how dare you utter Betty White's name in this topic.
703000	713000	How dare you. How very dare. OK. So actors in their their 90s. Yes. And I'm trying to pick names that people like today would know.
713000	729000	Olivia de Havilland. OK. Is 100. Wow. Which is you know she sued for her likeness used in the feud. Yes. I heard about that. Yes. And they're just you know Douglas is 100. OK. Kirk Kirk Douglas. Oh my gosh. I thought Kirk Douglas had passed.
729000	743000	No. OK. I'm again. Carol Channing ninety six. Peter Salas ninety six. Carol Channing is kind of immortal though. Betty White is ninety five. Carl Reiner is ninety five. Doris Day is ninety five.
743000	759000	S.S. this is a morbid topic you guys. S.S. you 100 Matt links us to a Web site called is a pagoda dead dot com. He finally did pass last year that I know that one I know. Jean Porter ninety four. All right. I remember the Conan O'Brien tribute to him because he had you know been on the show.
759000	773000	So I'm sure. Sure. All right. I'm going with Kirk Douglas if Kirk Douglas is 100. Like that's a that's a good long solid life. It's still alive. That's my news. Don't worry. There'll be plenty of people killed tonight in the new episode of Game of Thrones.
773000	784000	It'll offset everything right. Don't tell people about the competition. Don't tell people. Oh no. I didn't realize that Angela Lansbury is ninety one. Oh my gosh really. Dick Van Dyke is also ninety one.
784000	797000	All right. Close that page Jamie. We need to talk about video games. No more no more old celebrities. All right. Mel Brooks is ninety one. Jamie stop. All right. Mel Brooks also needs to protect. I am coming over there to close the lid to your computer.
797000	809000	Last one. Sidney Poitier. Fine. All right. Moving on. Let's talk about video games. Speaking of bands. That's the kickoff topic I want to get into tonight. So Jamie's just banned old celebrities from our show.
810000	821000	So let's talk a little bit about video game bands because there's been some chat in some various news stories and I have like a little bit of a personal anecdote as well about bands in video games.
821000	835000	So Splatoon 2 had it's kind of it's pre kickoff event. I don't know what else to call it was splat fast is what it was but it was kind of like a pre kickoff to Splatoon because the game isn't really out until next Friday because Nintendo games are Friday right.
835000	857000	So it's not on Friday but they did a pre splat fest thing with a special download and you got to participate in the first splat fest which was team cake versus team ice cream one team ice cream one which was the wrong answer because I'm team cake and I'm hearing this whole they actually had dialogue in the game that had this whole like ice cream is now better than cake.
857000	873000	That's the law. Well I'm sorry then I'm a law breaker because ever since I had my gallbladder out. I don't need ice cream because those of you that had a gallbladder out know what happens with certain foods and ice cream is the one for me so that the dot I don't need ice cream anymore.
873000	877000	So you know what I will be a law breaker cake is fine I can eat all the cake in the world.
878000	905000	So until ice cream stops making me physically sick. I'm always going to be team cake and you're going to have to deal with it. But anyway, that's not I did not bring that up to have a cake versus ice cream argument argument all fucking night because Lord knows we're only a couple weeks away from another splat fest and a whole nother thing to get mad at our friends about my point was is that we got to see a little bit of the game in action with this whole and I got to play a little bit of it during my gaming week.
906000	921000	Is my mic cutting out. I can't tell or is it just sorry guys. I couldn't tell my mic was cutting out. They are hearing it cut out in there. So sorry I need to do shopping. Yeah I know right. I might be out of backup mics. This is bad and backup cables.
921000	929000	All right. Well I'm just going to do my best to keep it running. That's the joy of live radio everybody doesn't we have duct tape. That's the way you fix everything right. All right.
929000	947000	Anyway. So where was I. OK. So yes cake versus ice cream. And my point was get the thing. The thing is this is the second cable. This isn't even maybe it's the mixing board. I don't know. Anyway well well it's money and money more money I could spend on the studio.
947000	965000	Anyway where was I going. Yeah where was I going with this. Oh yes. So you got to see a preview of Splatoon 2 in action right. So they were doing the whole Splatfest you actually got to play some stages in the game. You got to do some multiplayer no single player action or any of that or the co-op mode if you want to see that you're gonna have to buy Splatoon 2 when it comes out.
965000	977000	But one thing that people were noticing is that if you were disconnecting from matches purposefully Splatoon was warning you that you were about to get the smackdown.
977000	988000	A Twitter user got a screenshot that said and this is a message that popped up in the game your previous online play session didn't end naturally which is pretty suspicious.
988000	1003000	If this keeps happening we're gonna have to block you from playing online for a while. Make sure your Internet isn't busted and try again. So kind of an interesting little disclaimer there from Nintendo that's like we don't care if this is your Internet's fault.
1003000	1013000	If your Internet is busted don't don't be doing this right now. So I thought that was kind of interesting. What do you guys think of Nintendo's rule there.
1013000	1023000	I don't have a problem with their people are disconnecting me. It's going to be hard to find out if it's legitimately someone unplugging their Internet or just their Internet going out.
1023000	1035000	Yeah that's fair because if it's legitimately your Internet that's giving you that much problems then you're probably not going to play online anyways. If you're not consistently able to stay in a game then maybe another game is better for you.
1035000	1047000	Yeah yeah that's that's kind of my thought too is that you have to know a little bit about your Internet connection and you know your Internet connection being bad could be you know it can have an impact on the other people playing the game.
1047000	1056000	So you need to call your Internet provider and yell at them a little bit right. I guess but I'm kind of curious I'm sure there's some people out there that are like I can't help that my Internet is cheap.
1056000	1068000	And so it's like I don't want to like I don't want to sound like oh these people aren't allowed to have a good time but at the same time it's like if you keep disconnecting from matches especially these team based competitions that has an impact on everybody.
1068000	1077000	If you're finding that you're dropping from a lot of different games and I'm sorry I mean that's just you're going to have to get better Internet or not play online.
1077000	1089000	Yeah. Here's a stopping in our chat over at live dot com says hey it's on the switch. Take your switch over to your friend's house who has better Internet and play it there.
1089000	1097000	There you go. That's one stopping in chat says that sucks. I know you have to keep on top of cheaters but last year I was in a place with really shitty Wi-Fi.
1097000	1112000	I was getting disconnected all the time. Would you be able to switch to wired if it's your Wi-Fi. Could you or I guess does the switch allow you to put a LAN cable in it. I'm not sure if I don't know if it has a physical LAN thing in there but you probably have a they could use the USB.
1113000	1129000	Oh yeah. That whole thing I guess there's other ways to do that. All right. So there's that. So there's another story going on here that valve band 40 thousand steam users after the steam sale.
1129000	1144000	So I guess they're saying it's the biggest band wave that steam has ever done eclipsing a record of 15000 in October 2016. Apparently these are back bands and you lose access to playing online in any game that supports back.
1144000	1160000	That would mean dota to counter strike global offensive. They did the ban for this on this particular day because it prevents them from using the games that they got at a discount during the sale on another account to continue cheating.
1160000	1174000	So the cheaters lost the money that they spent during the sale. Kind of an interesting little way that I find with that. Yeah. That we have here. And honestly though honestly it's not going to really stop them anyways because they're just going to buy another.
1174000	1187000	You know another game or another there just start up another account and do it that way. Yeah they're really just cheating all the time. So you know you've seen valve you know try to combat the cheating thing and all this.
1187000	1198000	So now here's my personal anecdote and then I'm going to get to my question what all these kind of things have in common with the banning. So yesterday Alan and I went out we decided to go play Pokemon go because sometimes we needed to get out of the house.
1198000	1212000	We have a lot going on yesterday was actually kind of a slower weekend for me. So we went to one of the nearby parks and we were playing Pokemon go and we started taking some of the gyms that were there because there were a lot of red gyms because I play I play mystic and there were a lot of valor gyms only have one Pokemon on them.
1212000	1223000	So we're like oh this will be easy with two of us take down. So sure enough we take one down. So we take down a gym and then we start walking to the next gym and we see our first gym is already under attack. You guys probably know where this is going.
1223000	1236000	So we attack another gym and we walk to it and sure enough our first gym gets taken back by the same valor player that was on it. And we're like oh that person was like actually be here. Let's let's watch him go take the other gym that we just took.
1236000	1250000	So we were going to a third gym. This is a big part. We're going to a third gym and we were taking that one down and we're watching the second gym which is in a tree grove. Right. So you can kind of see if there's anybody in there or around. Nobody's there.
1250000	1265000	But the second gym is being fought. And then the third gym we kind of like just kind of hang out there for a little bit. We're literally standing right there. The third gym was in an open baseball field. We could see everything if if a person had moved from the second gym to the third gym we'd be able to see it.
1265000	1281000	Nope. Can't see it. So I reported his ass to Niantic and I hope all of you that see these cheaters in Pokemon Go do it. You need to be like 99.99 percent sure you've got a cheater. But hell yeah I'm going to report it.
1281000	1290000	I reported the cheating in Ingress and I'm going to report it in Pokemon Go. Fuck cheaters and fuck spoofers. Seriously. It's the worst thing you can do in one of these location based games in my opinion.
1290000	1305000	So here's the question I have for all you guys with these stories like Splatoon and Valve and all this stuff. What is a game company's responsibility to weeding out the cheaters of their game?
1305000	1318000	What do you think a game company's responsibility is in weeding out the cheaters of their game? Do you think that you know because the reason why I put it this way is that I think there's a lot of people that when Pokemon Go first came out they were like well nothing's going to get done about spoofers.
1318000	1325000	Because Niantic doesn't have the staff to handle it. Well the question would be should Niantic have had the foresight to have those game masters.
1325000	1340000	That's not true though. Niantic could handle it. They could just examine the data that they have like the GPS data because a lot of these spoofing programs that are out there they'll spoof the X and Y but not the Z.
1340000	1350000	So they're always at the same altitude never changing despite the fact that the landscape might be different. So that's one way to kind of catch people.
1350000	1365000	And then also reading that extra data like the cell towers that are nearby because they capture all those wifi access points so which wifi networks are nearby? Can you triangulate? Does that match up with what we're showing to be in this area? That type of stuff.
1366000	1371000	They could do it. It's just are they doing it? Nah.
1371000	1380000	Kaijuto in chat says something over at live.vognetwork.com that I want to respond to. Kaijuto says if you're going to report a cheat it has to be 100% no doubt not 99%.
1380000	1390000	Here's why I phrased it the way I did because well for all I know there's an underground tunnel system or this guy's a ninja turtle that lives in the sewers.
1390000	1400000	I don't know maybe there is a reasonable explanation but all I know is that I am looking all around me there's no cars there's no people like as far as I can see to the eye this guy ain't there.
1400000	1408000	So the reason why I say that is that I am 99% certain when I record it but Niantic should be 100% when they ban it.
1409000	1420000	And whatever game it is I'm using Pokemon Go in this case but whatever game it is the game maker should be 100% sure when they do the ban but they have access to logs records and things that I can't see.
1420000	1430000	They can see this guy's full activity. So yes I think I'm okay saying I'm 99% sure when I report because maybe there's more than meets the eye here I don't fucking know.
1430000	1439000	But Niantic should be 100% when they pull the trigger and actually ban but that's what you're doing you're filing a request to investigate basically right.
1439000	1450000	They're not going to just ban because oh Rob reported and one player reported this guy so we're going to ban him like that actually would not be okay because I could get I could just file bans on people I don't like and that's not okay.
1450000	1452000	And there's some people that do that but I'm sure.
1452000	1455000	Yeah I'm sure especially in the other game Jesus Christ.
1455000	1465000	Well it's like the court system you know you have to weigh the facts and come up with a decision with something that's not going beyond your reasonable doubt.
1465000	1475000	So I mean you can you've basically looking at the situation sure there could be some weird thing like yeah you could be in a helicopter or something ridiculous.
1475000	1476000	There was no helicopter.
1476000	1491000	Which is not the case but like just say you know that could maybe be a thing or something whatever you know for if you're just making it's not your job to be 100% it's your job to say okay hey I think this person's cheating.
1491000	1494000	It's for them to figure out if this person is cheating right.
1494000	1499000	And I've you know as yet I have a I have a more than reasonable suspicion this person's cheating.
1499000	1510000	And it didn't just another thing that made me do it was it didn't just happen once it happened three actually four times because then we went back and took the second note again and we're like let's make this guy burn a bunch of equipment haha.
1510000	1521000	But then we kind of thought it through and we're like if this guy's a spoofer he's just going to spoof right on over to downtown and load up on pokey stops it's not even going to matter like we actually have to travel to get the equipment.
1521000	1525000	Anyway, let's see.
1525000	1538000	Going to our chat over at live.vog network.com stopping and chat says, I think the company has a lot of responsibility if it's in single player no biggie, but multiplayer cheating has a severe effect on the enjoyment of others.
1538000	1546000	It affects their multiplayer community. If the game goes to shit because multiplayer becomes shit. It's their fault for not clamping down on that.
1546000	1558000	And I guess it's not as bad as Ingress because Ingress there's at least actual like gaming and score and stuff like that. And so that really matters where it's taking a gym. Who cares? They took a gym.
1558000	1560000	It's my coins. That's what matters.
1561000	1576000	Okay, big deal. It's just a gym. There's no score in the game or really any game yet. It's just very early. But when there are points and stuff worldwide. Yeah, that's going to be a problem. You better fix that shit before that happens.
1577000	1588000	I want to ask Jamie about this too, what your thoughts are. Not just necessarily Pokemon Go, but bans and the company's responsibility to it in general.
1588000	1592000	But some other comments in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
1592000	1600000	SSJ100Matt says, I've had this happen. I was in an open field and nobody was nearby. But this happened when the game came out. Who knows?
1600000	1613000	SSJ100Matt also says, if Niantic had YouTube rules, they would auto ban people. That's true. So anyway, Jamie, what are your thoughts? What is the company's responsibility to the banning of the players?
1614000	1629000	It is their responsibility to remove anything that negates the way the game is meant to be played. So if it is creating a disadvantage for the people who are following the rules and they have an obligation to ban those who are not playing by the rules.
1629000	1649000	So if they don't have the staff available, then they owe it to themselves to dedicate people to it, either by hiring or outsourcing people to manage those certain functions. End of story. There's nothing to argue about it.
1649000	1659000	As far as cheating in games and how I feel about it, I think I've mentioned this before and I think you guys feel similar, but feel free to jump in with your own opinions.
1659000	1668000	In single player games, I don't give a crap what you do when it comes to cheating. That's a single player experience. In fact, sometimes cheating is really fucking funny in single player games.
1668000	1680000	Sometimes I remember, especially in older games, especially older PC games, it was encouraged like, you know, typing in some of those cheat codes, right? IDBFG would give you the gun. All that stuff is like DLC.
1680000	1682000	That's a programmed part into the game now.
1682000	1695000	I guess. Yeah, I guess that's true. That's true. But I mean, with single player games doesn't matter. And I think about like, if you think about it, awesome games done quick in a way is kind of like, it's all about cheating in a way exploiting. It's a great line.
1695000	1699000	They're not multiplayer. They don't expect other people playing the game.
1699000	1712000	Exactly. And that's the key difference is that multiplayer. I have a big problem if people want to cheat a multiplayer unless they have set up a server on their own cheater island or whatever to do this.
1712000	1730000	And I'll even put it this way. And this is in anything, not just gaming in real life. The moment that you do something that puts another party at or a group of people at a disadvantage, you have lost your right to participate. End of story.
1730000	1742000	Any, you know, and I understand there's, you know, non purpose, purposeful, negative things, but the point that you do it for your own personal game at the gain at the expense of other people. No.
1743000	1751000	And that's what kind of pisses me off about the Pokemon go stuff is there's a lot of spoofers who really take pride in what they're doing and the whole like deal with it type of stuff.
1752000	1764000	Exactly. And like, that's like, but like, seriously, you know, that's not fucking fair that the rest of us are actually traveling these spots and actually out there in the real world.
1764000	1776000	And you feel some sense of pride in having all these gyms that you didn't have to work for. You know what that means? Nothing. It means you're shit. You're a shit player because you have to fucking cheat to get things done.
1776000	1788000	That's what it means. If you are cheating in these games, you are shit. Get off the internet or get your own fucking, like if you want to cheat and Pokemon go, I'm assuming go, go find a way to set up your own server.
1788000	1797000	I'm sure hackers going to hack, right? I'm sure there's a way to set up your own fucking Pokemon, go server, have a fucking blast, but don't affect the game that the rest of us are playing.
1797000	1805000	That's the whole thing. Same thing with MMOs, like World of Warcraft. If you have your own private World of Warcraft servers, if you want to cheat, go.
1805000	1815000	Man, that Final Fantasy XI server that was on where like the leveling is like, oh, it's 10 times faster. You can run four times faster and you get tons more drops and stuff. That was fun.
1815000	1819000	But that was also completely separate and it's also shut down and I'm sad that.
1819000	1828000	And the other point about those private servers is that they are built with the intent of having them played that way. Like all the free Ragnarok servers I was on.
1828000	1836000	It was made, it doesn't affect anyone else playing on the ones created and maintained by the owners.
1836000	1845000	So it doesn't matter if you're playing it the way it's not intended to be played. You're not affecting the people who are paying for the service. So.
1845000	1854000	And I want to mention this in chat over at live.vognetware.com. Bobby Black Wolf, who's before us here on Sunday night says, some people love being trolls.
1854000	1864000	They like hearing you get upset and call them shit. They just won. Here's the thing. I'm not going to lose sleep over it in a way. I kind of go like, I'm trolling trolls.
1864000	1873000	But at the end of the day, I'm not going to like, the way Pokemon Go goes is not going to like better or worse in my life. It's a fucking video game.
1873000	1881000	That's the thing. I'm not going to let the trolls have power over me in that sense. But I am going to make it my mission to end their fun.
1881000	1889000	Two can play at this game, bitch. And that's my response.
1890000	1901000	Anyway, anything else on bans before we get into our gaming weeks and the types of video games that hopefully we didn't cheat on? I don't know.
1901000	1907000	Ban whiny man baby cunts. Ban everything. Ban everything enjoyable. Alright.
1907000	1915000	No, I'm just talking about the whiny man babies. This is all I'm going to say about it. You don't own Doctor Who. Get the fuck over it.
1915000	1926000	Here's the thing with all that. And maybe this is just a testament to the people I follow on Twitter or the accounts I mute and so forth.
1926000	1934000	Like, I'm not seeing people upset about it. I'm just seeing people saying, well, I mean, are you seeking it out?
1934000	1944000	No. Trust me. I just choose. Block. Move on. Mute. Move on. I just don't follow those people.
1944000	1950000	I'm going to say this. There are things that women are exposed more to on the internet and in real life than men know to look for.
1950000	1962000	Because you don't have to look for it. It doesn't affect you. For me all the time, I have seen, even from people that I trusted to be more progressive than apparently how they are,
1962000	1974000	whining about a very talented actress with a very talented writer going with it, too, being the doctor. And I'm like, what the fuck is your problem?
1974000	1982000	I thought that you were a better person than this. And I've seen way too many man babies crying over it. And I'm sorry, they're fucking man babies. Get over it.
1982000	1985000	The world doesn't revolve around you. We're heading toward equality. Thank you.
1985000	1993000	Let me ask a tough question that needs to be asked. And this whole thing. And again, you're right. I'm going to dial it back a bit.
1993000	2001000	Because you're right. As a guy, I don't necessarily always get exposed to the same type of bullshit on Twitter and stuff that women do. And I'll admit that.
2001000	2011000	But let me ask this. Isn't this a natural cycle of Doctor Who is that any time they announce a new date, like when they announced Matt Smith, it was like, he's too fucking young.
2012000	2021000	And when they announced Peter Capaldi, he's too fucking old. And then it's like, everybody always fucking comes around once the show is on air. And it's like, it really wasn't that bad.
2021000	2029000	Would it be okay? And I'm not asking this for myself, but I'm asking this as the person who does interviews on the show.
2029000	2042000	Is it okay to be criticizing the new Doctor Who based on the writing, the show's creative direction, the things that other doctors in the past are criticized on? Is that an okay criticism?
2042000	2047000	Well, absolutely. You know, I'm perfect. I'm super happy that Moffat's out of the picture now.
2048000	2052000	I felt weird because I'm like, actually, most people I see are really happy about Moffat being gone.
2052000	2063000	Because, well, he was another one of those, you know, stupid man babies who can't write a woman to save his life other than failing every aspect of the Bechdel test.
2063000	2072000	But the thing I'm getting more on is just people fully attacking having a woman as the doctor.
2072000	2083000	Yeah, and please do not get me wrong. Don't fucking misunderstand my line of questioning here because like the whole, and I saw the quotes about the whole, the TARDIS full of bras and stuff where I just like, like, it's laughably stupid.
2083000	2098000	Like, it's just like, wow, people are really stupid. And you know, there's just like comment sections on the internet and stuff. But I also kind of recognize you, there's a line, like if you're criticizing the new Doctor Who just because Doctor Who's a woman, like, get over it. Bye.
2098000	2107000	There's this meme going around that's the Doctor Who announcement bingo. Every single one of those comments on there I've seen. I could have had a full card by now.
2107000	2119000	And it's like, I don't even, I don't even care about their opinions anymore. The moment that they bring it up just as a factor of gender, their opinion is immediately invalid. End of story.
2119000	2126000	I don't even entertain it. I don't talk to them about it. They're instantly one of those people. And they're not worth my time.
2126000	2134000	And I, maybe I just kind of also feel removed a little bit from this because I just, I don't watch a lot of TV. I haven't watched Doctor Who since Eccleston was the Doctor.
2134000	2136000	That was a long time ago.
2136000	2142000	I was sad when David Tennant left, but I supported his decision to leave and I was looking forward to seeing what the new one would be like.
2142000	2149000	Yeah, people, Sean Connery wasn't James Bond forever and you know, actors move on from roles. They don't want to get typecast or any of that stuff.
2149000	2154000	I was perfectly happy when the Master was a woman, although I'd really like for them to bring back the Ronnie because he was awesome.
2154000	2159000	But I don't know what any of that means. I'm sorry. I just, I really don't.
2159000	2168000	The Master is like a long term, not really so much rival, just like the, what's the word I'm thinking of?
2168000	2178000	I guess enemy, but a little bit more personal than that. But it's just stupid. It's stupid. So stupid.
2178000	2187000	Why are people so hung up about what's between someone's fucking legs? Get over it. Just fucking get over people.
2187000	2195000	You people who believe that a person's gender is what determines their quality of an individual, you are a relic.
2195000	2203000	You are going the way of the fucking dinosaur, which by the way, we were wrong about the fucking dinosaurs, but we're not wrong about you because dinosaurs had feathers.
2204000	2216000	All of these people, they're relics. Their time has passed. They're holding on to something that they're never going to recapture again because they're being left behind.
2216000	2221000	People are learning that their way of thinking is wrong and people don't like being proven wrong.
2221000	2235000	And don't get me wrong, I also want to make crystal clear, despite some of my tough questions, representation absolutely matters, you know, and not everybody out there necessarily gets it who's been represented very well for years and years and years.
2235000	2248000	But like, I think it says a lot when you see that clip, and I don't know if you guys have seen this on Twitter, there's like a little girl who's watching the reveal the Doctor Who thing and just the way her face lights up at the end when she goes, Doctor, who's a girl?
2248000	2262000	Like, you know, that shit matters, you know, and representation is important. Absolutely. So I just want to make that clear, because some people may take issue with some of those questions I was asking, but I just kind of what I wanted to draw just like a very clear line between the two types of criticisms.
2262000	2276000	If it's something about writing a direction that I don't mind. Yeah. But if it's just based on if it's just how can Doctor Who be a woman, it's like, watch the first couple episodes and find out or my understanding is they've already set the framework for this.
2276000	2292000	Most people were like, we saw this coming. Yeah. Yeah. We didn't talk about it for years. Yeah. So you see women can go to medical school as well. And then get out. Yes. Oh my god, because my primary care physician hasn't been a woman for like 15 years.
2292000	2307000	Meaning that my primary care physician is a woman and has been for like 15 years. And the other thing, too, people need to get used to this kind of discussion happening, because it's not fucking going away until people get over this antiquated idea of gender role.
2307000	2312000	Until women get paid an equal wage. We're going to keep talking about it. Yeah.
2313000	2323000	All right, let's move on, shall we? Let's talk about back to video games. But I understand that there's there's a lot of people talk about that today. So I understand.
2323000	2340000	And yeah, there's a lot of and just because I don't watch Doctor Who I know there's a lot of great shows on the voice geeks network. They do watch Doctor Who and they talk a lot about the different episodes. And that's, that's part of the reason why we built this network because, you know, I can't be an expert in everything geek.
2340000	2356000	I know games. I know a lot about the games when it comes to television and stuff. That's why we got that's why we got critical myth and British invaders and pod culture like that. That's that's days, days department. So I'll be tuning into those shows to see what they think about all this.
2356000	2366000	Meanwhile, though, let's talk about video games, since that's what we do here, usually, and talk about our gaming weeks. What types of video games have you been playing this week? Dark Sakura?
2367000	2381000	I've been playing lots of Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2, because it's really freaking fun. And it's almost as much fun as watching the show, which includes a lot of just screaming. Just screaming. It's great. Really good stress relief, too.
2381000	2397000	And I've been playing Dragon Ball Dokkan Battle on iOS and Miitomo, Pokemon Go, and not much of anything else. I've really been very busy.
2398000	2401000	Okie dokie. No DDR while you got the foot in the boot.
2402000	2415000	Actually, I'm I'm going to be when this comes off. I need to find a good machine locally so I can use that to because I'm so restless with this fucking thing on that. Like, I just want to go out and play.
2416000	2424000	I wouldn't call it local, but I really especially when you live in the south of here. But when an elk south of here, it's Elk Grove.
2425000	2435000	I don't like to totally give away personal information. You're right. It's a big there's like 90,000 people live there. I know. But anyway, but like strikes is up in Rocklin.
2436000	2444000	It's the fuck far away. No, but it's it's kind of worth it, though, because they got they got a lot of cool stuff there. But you're right for you. It's probably just as fast to go to like Concord.
2445000	2451000	I'd rather get around one. Yeah, I don't blame you. I don't blame you. All right. Anyway, let's go to Loki. How was your gaming week?
2452000	2461000	I didn't play anything. I just played me while I played basically just a stupid idle clicker office space game. I actually stopped playing Pokemon Go. I just I don't care enough anymore.
2462000	2466000	And like I was doing my dailies like I forgot it. Well, I guess I don't do that anymore.
2467000	2473000	I'm not beholden to this game anymore. Exactly. So I was like, well, it's like, OK, I can go spin the pokestops to get more pokeballs.
2474000	2479000	I have too many. I have like one hundred and seventy two and I'm not catching anything. And where's my Slurpee?
2480000	2484000	Alan just walked in and brought me. So you want to sit? No, I'm good. I have cooties.
2485000	2490000	So, yeah, it was just I didn't play anything, but mainly because I want to work on actually making games.
2491000	2494000	And then on top of that, I was tired. So that's it.
2496000	2502000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Andrade with VOG Network dot com, use the passphrase input.
2504000	2511000	Hello. Hi Alan. I grabbed or Rob handed me his mic before he could properly introduce me.
2512000	2519000	I have a breaking news for from Orange Lounge Foodio. We went to Dutch Brothers yesterday and I wanted to find those Dunkin Donut Oreos.
2520000	2527000	So I went to Wal-Mart in Rancho Cordova. The website said they had them. I downloaded the app on in-store Wi-Fi and because they weren't there.
2527000	2533000	Neither were the jelly donut ones. So JD will appreciate this if you're listening. I wanted Oreos.
2534000	2538000	So you went on a food trip that ended up being a complete bust and you had to willingly go to Wal-Mart to do it.
2539000	2545000	Yes, I did get, though, the Dunkin Donuts Pop Tarts so you can eat those tomorrow. Yay. Bye.
2546000	2550000	All right. Thank you for that very important food update. I appreciate it. All right.
2551000	2554000	Well, that's it for Loki's Gaming Week. I'll talk about my gaming week a little bit.
2554000	2561000	And, let's see, I already talked about Splatoon 2 and doing the little pre-event there. I only played a couple rounds of it.
2562000	2567000	And then I was like, oh, well, nothing in this carries over to the main game. Wow, I'm still really terrible at this.
2568000	2570000	I'm going to wait and try the single player in Splatoon 2 when it comes out.
2571000	2576000	But it was fine. It was set up really well. The presentation of this Splatfest was really well done. I will give it that.
2577000	2581000	Let's see, what else did I play this week? I played Pokemon Go as well, which I already talked about earlier.
2581000	2587000	And the game that's been taking up the most of my time, well, besides Final Fantasy XIV, which continues to be a thing.
2588000	2596000	But now I have been playing a lot of Final Fantasy XII, the Zodiac Age, which just came out on Tuesday.
2597000	2603000	But I got my copy on Friday because I waited to get the Steel Book Edition because I was really stupid and I didn't pre-order.
2604000	2607000	I thought I had this whole time. Then Tuesday came around and I'm like, where's my shipping notice?
2607000	2609000	Oh, I never bought it. I see, that's what happened.
2610000	2618000	So I had to wait until Friday to get my Steel Book Edition, but I got the game and I got to say, oh my gosh, Final Fantasy XII has really aged well.
2619000	2625000	Like, just as a game. Like, wow. I'm having more fun with it now, I think, even the one who was on PlayStation 2 originally.
2626000	2633000	I really like some of the quality of life changes they've made, how you can kind of have the transparent map that's on your screen by clicking L3.
2634000	2644000	How you can speed the game up is amazing. You can do double or quadruple time, even, to just make, like, I'm in that area right now.
2645000	2650000	What do they call it? The Yirba Sands or something, where you're in those big oil towers that are like the giant circles.
2651000	2657000	And it's not the most pleasant map in the world, but man, when you put that thing on double speed, it's so much easier to grind through.
2658000	2663000	And yes, man, the speed alone is like a huge quality of life improvement there with that.
2664000	2671000	But yeah, it's making me really love this game all over again. Like, I love how, you know, XII was the game that came after XI.
2672000	2679000	So there's MMO-esque elements of it, like multiplayer elements, I would say, but it's not a multiplayer game.
2680000	2687000	You know, it's definitely a single-player experience, but you program the other people in your party through the Gambit system to be able to do the things you want them to do.
2688000	2692000	And I just, yeah, I love it. And the battle system is a lot of fun, and I'm really enjoying my way through the game.
2693000	2700000	If I had any criticisms whatsoever, my real minor complaint would probably be the voice acting, but not what you think.
2700000	2705000	The voice actors themselves are great, and especially Gideon Emery as Balthier.
2706000	2712000	I mean, let's be real, Final Fantasy XII is the Balthier and Fran show, and all these other people too.
2713000	2719000	That's not my complaint. My complaint is the actual quality of the voice acting clips.
2720000	2729000	That hasn't changed since the PlayStation 2 era, and I think over the orchestrated soundtrack, I can actually hear in some places a little bit of the distortion and a little bit of popping.
2730000	2740000	And some of the lower quality of the sound bits probably being compressed for PlayStation 2 and now coming over to PlayStation 4, because they certainly didn't have everybody re-record their lines or anything like that.
2741000	2747000	At the end of the day, that is an extremely minor complaint, but I did tease that I had one minor issue on Twitter, so there it is.
2748000	2759000	That one relic quality from PlayStation 2 I don't think aged as well, but you can kind of get used to it and tune it out, and that's something you kind of get over at some point.
2760000	2766000	Oh my gosh, I'm just really enjoying the game and the story. I'm into the story way more than I was the first time, even.
2767000	2772000	Yeah, so if you're a fan of role-playing games or a fan of Final Fantasy, you really should check this out.
2773000	2779000	And I know we talked about last week a little bit about accessibility. I don't remember if this was on our phone call with Bobby or if we got into it on our show a little bit.
2780000	2784000	But I kind of mentioned that Final Fantasy XII may not be the best Final Fantasy game to start with.
2784000	2793000	I still think maybe Final Fantasy X as far as traditional Final Fantasy games go, but I don't think XII is as hard to get into as I remember.
2794000	2799000	Or it's something about this game and those quality of life improvements in the year 2017 that make it easier to play.
2800000	2806000	But I think I'm going to take back a little bit what I said last week. I think if you want to start with Final Fantasy XII, you can.
2806000	2815000	Just realize that it was the beginning of a newer direction for the series, and it doesn't really reflect the older games prior to it as well.
2816000	2827000	Again, when Final Fantasy had XI that went MMO, that changed a lot of things about the franchise that even carried on into XII, XIII, and the way Act of Time Battle plays out in XIII.
2828000	2830000	And XV, certainly, a lot of that you see as well.
2830000	2841000	Speaking of XV, by the way, I really think as far as a Final Fantasy experience on Playstation 4 worth waiting for, XII has given it to me in a way XV didn't.
2842000	2850000	I almost feel like Final Fantasy XII is Final Fantasy XV, which makes no sense at all, but that's how it is in my head.
2851000	2855000	I'm like, this is the Final Fantasy game I've been waiting for, so that's honestly where I'm at.
2855000	2859000	I hope you guys that have been playing it are enjoying it as well.
2860000	2863000	None of you guys have checked it out yet? Any plans to check out the Zodiac gauge?
2864000	2867000	No? At some point you should. It's a great Final Fantasy title.
2868000	2869000	Maybe if it's on sale for like 10 bucks or something.
2870000	2871000	That'll probably happen eventually, who knows.
2872000	2876000	Let's get into some housekeeping real quick, and then I'm going to get into gaming news.
2877000	2882000	As far as housekeeping goes tonight, I do want to mention our new Discord server, if you're not already there.
2883000	2892000	Just go to vognetwork.com slash Discord and you can join our new Discord server, which we have been using to talk about when people are live streaming,
2893000	2898000	throw article ideas back and forth, tell you when new podcasts go up from all the shows on the network, and it's great.
2899000	2902000	We have over 40 people on the Discord already, which is awesome.
2902000	2909000	It's been growing. Welcome to those of you guys that want to join with us over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.
2910000	2913000	We're also on Twitter, Twitter.com slash O-L-R, and we're on Facebook as well.
2914000	2919000	Now I think it's time we get into some gaming news. Loki, tell us about what's been going on in gaming news this week.
2920000	2926000	There's a brand new subscription service for indie games called JUMP, which is coming out very soon.
2926000	2935000	They're going to be running a closed beta for it until July 24th. They're planning on launching the service with 60 to 100 indie games,
2936000	2941000	and for $10 a month you get access to play those games, so that's kind of neat.
2942000	2944000	$10 isn't very expensive either.
2945000	2953000	No, it's not. Basically, they're saying the way indie developers will be paid out on that will be based on how much time subscribers play their games.
2953000	2964000	So that's kind of neat. I like this a little bit better than, say, the humble indie, the humble monthly that they do.
2965000	2975000	Because it's humble monthly, you don't know what you're getting, and with someone with 500 Steam games, you're likely to run into duplicates sometimes.
2976000	2985000	So this is kind of cool that you get to play all that, but once again, because I do have so many games in my backlog, I probably wouldn't actually want to pay for a service like this,
2986000	2990000	because, you know, I just would not have time to play any of this.
2991000	2992000	But it's cool, though.
2993000	2996000	I love that something like it exists. It really reminds me of GameTap.
2996000	2997000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2998000	3002000	How many years ago was GameTap? That feels like forever ago now. That was at least...
3003000	3006000	That had to be like almost 10 years ago at this point, when GameTap was kind of...
3007000	3014000	Here's the other cool thing, though, with that. They have it broken down, so with that, you get a library of PC, Mac, Vive, and Oculus Rift games.
3015000	3020000	So not only are you getting traditional PC games, but you're also getting VR games, which is kind of cool.
3021000	3024000	Wasn't that supposed to be the concept behind the Phantom console, too? Remember that?
3024000	3028000	I don't think there was a concept. It was just a console that you were going to download.
3029000	3033000	No, they had an E3 booth one year, remember? They had a whole console.
3034000	3042000	I remember they got made fun of a lot for that, but I think it was the fact that it was a console dedicated to all this stuff. I don't even remember.
3043000	3048000	Can somebody remind me, why did we hate the Phantom? Or did we? It's been so many years.
3049000	3050000	It's just so ephemeral.
3051000	3056000	I think it was because that system was a couple hundred dollars, and you still had to pay a monthly fee on top of it.
3057000	3063000	Because it was like a PC that you would download games to, and it's like, but I have a PC. Why do I need another PC to do this?
3064000	3068000	I guess that's true. Going to chat over at live.vog.network.com, MXC says,
3069000	3074000	It takes like 10 to 20 seconds to launch the games within JMP's client. Once in, they run pretty well, though.
3075000	3081000	I noticed some occasional lag, at least on my internet, lol. So, some people in chat are already using the service, it sounds like.
3082000	3083000	Very cool. That's kind of neat.
3084000	3089000	Yeah, in fact, if you are interested in checking it out, they're saying the service is going to be coming later this summer.
3090000	3092000	And if you want to check it out, playonjump.com.
3093000	3099000	Oh, so they must, because one of our members is saying they're in there, so they're having like a beta trial or something?
3100000	3101000	Yeah, they're doing a beta right now until the 24th.
3102000	3103000	Oh, that's cool. So you can jump into the beta.
3104000	3111000	Nice. I might have to check that out, just to see what all's there. You never know what cool little indie game you might find on there.
3112000	3114000	Yeah, there might be some stuff that's kind of ehhh.
3115000	3116000	They said it's highly curated.
3117000	3122000	Really? So they don't just let anybody come on the service, they seek stuff out?
3123000	3128000	I don't really know how it works. You can submit your game if you want to, so you can send them a submission.
3129000	3135000	But like, I'm just trying to see some of the stuff they have in the background here. It looks like Moleman must die.
3136000	3140000	They're trying to screen out like Fart Simulator 2017.
3141000	3142000	Right, it's not going to be any of that bullshit.
3143000	3144000	I gotcha, I gotcha. That's good.
3145000	3152000	MXC says the beta only has about 8 games so far, but the official launch will have 20 or so, at least that's the plan.
3153000	3156000	MXC continues they have some great games like A Wizard's Lizard.
3157000	3162000	I think I saw a Grinder Profile titled that once. A Wizard's Lizard and The Bridge.
3163000	3167000	There you go. Are some of the games that are, I shouldn't make, I don't even know what this game is.
3168000	3172000	I'm sorry to the creator of Wizard's Lizard, but you have to admit that's a pretty fucking funny title.
3173000	3174000	Dark Saga's trying not to laugh over there.
3175000	3177000	Are you a fan of the Wizard Lizard?
3177000	3183000	Alright, I'm curious, here's my curiosity.
3184000	3188000	Raginator is like the deals guy here at pretty much VOG.
3189000	3191000	I would say OLR, he calls in a Bobby show all the time too.
3192000	3195000	If Game Buoy and Electric Sisterhood took calls he'd probably call in to them too.
3196000	3198000	To talk about what video games are on sale.
3199000	3202000	So my question to Raginator is, is this a deal for you?
3203000	3205000	Because you're saying in chat, enough games, enough games, dude there's no such thing.
3205000	3211000	So Raginator, like $10 a month to play all the, well not all the games.
3212000	3213000	Like 80 to 100 games.
3214000	3218000	A buffet, a Las Vegas buffet of indie games, is that a deal?
3219000	3224000	And I'm pinpointing Raginator, but I really open that up to everybody. Is that a deal?
3225000	3227000	And here's what they said about the internet speed too since we were talking about earlier.
3228000	3233000	You know, how your internet speed may affect playing games like Splatoon 2.
3233000	3236000	And how you might now be able to play online because you get banned because you're dropping out.
3237000	3239000	They said the internet, and what internet speed do I need?
3240000	3242000	Don't worry, any old broadband connection speed will do.
3243000	3244000	That only affects the initial loading of games.
3245000	3247000	So while it may take longer to using dial up at grandma's house.
3248000	3251000	After loading the game, plays locally on your desktop.
3252000	3253000	No need for super fast connection.
3254000	3256000	Although it will make your initial game loads super fast.
3257000	3260000	Most games load in under 60 seconds on a 15 megabit connection.
3260000	3263000	So it's downloading the entire game. It's not streaming the whole thing.
3264000	3265000	That makes sense.
3266000	3268000	And MXC is clarifying to be fair to the creators of a wizard's lizard.
3269000	3270000	It is Zelda inspired.
3271000	3273000	Now you have my attention.
3274000	3277000	I'm assuming that means old school Zelda, not like 3D Zelda.
3278000	3281000	It's dangerous to go alone. Take my wizard's lizard.
3291000	3292000	Good night everybody.
3293000	3294000	You've been listening to Orange...
3295000	3296000	Alright, I'm kidding. Alright.
3297000	3301000	Let's see, going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
3302000	3306000	Raginator says, I'm not really into reading games. I want to outright own the games.
3307000	3311000	Oh, a little difference there. I want to amass that collection of these are mine.
3312000	3313000	That's what it seems for.
3314000	3315000	That's what it seems for.
3315000	3319000	I mean, see him and like, hey, if you want cheap games and what they had like today,
3320000	3321000	I want to say, I think it was bundle stars.
3322000	3325000	They had, what was it? Skullgirls with the DLC for a dollar.
3326000	3327000	Can't beat that.
3330000	3331000	Alright, moving on.
3332000	3333000	Let's go to some more stories.
3334000	3335000	Let's talk about Nintendo Switch.
3336000	3338000	I have my own little buffet of Nintendo Switch updates, actually.
3339000	3343000	A few things to note about the Nintendo Switch as the library of games is growing and growing.
3343000	3345000	I think it's really nice and relieving to see.
3346000	3348000	It looks like the Switch is not facing the curse of the Wii U.
3349000	3351000	We still have a steady stream of games coming out for the Switch.
3352000	3356000	And good news, the Jackbox Party Pack 3, which was already released on the Nintendo Switch,
3357000	3362000	I'm imagining must be doing well enough that it was announced by Jackbox Games.
3363000	3364000	We've only had them on the show twice.
3365000	3371000	Jackbox Games on Twitter mention that the Jackbox Party Pack 1 and 2 are also coming to the Nintendo Switch.
3371000	3378000	So, whereas, yeah, okay, if you have PlayStation 4 or Xbox One or even Steam, you've probably already picked these up.
3379000	3385000	But, there is something awfully convenient about the Switch, being able to put that on the tabletop and instant party.
3386000	3389000	So, these games are kind of getting a second life of sorts all through the Nintendo Switch.
3390000	3393000	So, those games are coming out on Nintendo Switch, so that's pretty cool.
3394000	3400000	They didn't say when, but I'm assuming before the holiday or the good old fashioned soon.
3401000	3406000	I don't know if you guys have checked out Cave Story Plus, but that recently came out on the Nintendo Switch.
3407000	3411000	And, in August, they are going to be patching in a classic graphics mode.
3412000	3416000	So, in August, you will be able to switch between the new graphics and the classic graphics.
3417000	3419000	So, that's pretty cool. A little perk for people that own that game.
3420000	3422000	I'm loving how much, have you noticed this?
3423000	3428000	A lot of the Nintendo Switch games have really been getting, like, really strong post-release support.
3428000	3432000	And, I think that's important too. Like, we talked about Blaster Master Zero last week.
3433000	3438000	The Bomberman game, even though I didn't like it, you know, they have Pyramid Head Bomberman in there now.
3439000	3440000	Like, they have all this crazy stuff in there.
3441000	3442000	And, now you see the Cave Story is getting stuff.
3443000	3447000	I really like that these games are getting well supported past their launch. That's pretty cool.
3448000	3451000	And, I love this. A little follow up to something we talked about last week.
3452000	3455000	Pac-Man Versus is coming out on Nintendo Switch. We already talked about that last week.
3455000	3461000	But, what if you only have one copy of the game, but you still want to be able to play the game?
3462000	3464000	Because you're going to need two Switches to really play the game to its full potential.
3465000	3467000	Where one Switch is Pac-Man, the other Switch is the ghost.
3468000	3469000	Well, here's what's pretty cool about it.
3470000	3474000	Even though there's no download play on the Nintendo Switch, like you have on the 3DS,
3475000	3483000	Bandai Namco, their solution for Namco Museum is to release a new title on the eShop called Pac-Man Versus
3483000	3485000	Free Multiplayer Only Version.
3486000	3490000	And, with this app on your Switch, it will talk to the game on somebody else's Switch
3491000	3494000	and allow you to have one copy of the game playable on two Switches.
3495000	3499000	So, it is a little bit of a work around, but hey, you know, good guy Bandai Namco in this case
3500000	3504000	putting this together so that you wouldn't have to have two copies of the game in order to play Pac-Man Versus
3505000	3509000	the way it's really intended. So, lots of exciting stuff on the Steam front. Very, very cool.
3509000	3512000	Alright, let's move on. Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?
3513000	3520000	Kingdom Hearts 3. Yes, because Squenix can count to three, unlike some other companies out there.
3521000	3523000	Well, to be fair, it hasn't been released yet.
3524000	3529000	And, to be fair, they also use a little weird number system that has all these weird fractions and shit.
3530000	3533000	2.8, 2.5 Final HD. Alright, sorry Jamie.
3534000	3541000	Anyway, so we have, though, some new world announcements, including a couple of gameplay trailers.
3542000	3544000	So, the one I'm really excited about is the Toy Story one.
3545000	3553000	Because, how, we haven't had any Pixar presence, I think, in any of the Kingdom Hearts games to my memory.
3554000	3556000	I don't recall either. I don't think so.
3556000	3563000	I'm about as giddy as this, almost as I was giddy for Tron World, which was based off of the original Tron.
3564000	3569000	Right. I think they did Tron Legacy in the DS game, the 3DS game. Dream Drop Distance, I think they did.
3570000	3579000	But, with all that, the way it looked, the way the characters looked in that trailer was as good as they did in the first Toy Story movie. It's crazy.
3579000	3583000	Well, I was also noticing some of the other background elements, too.
3584000	3590000	Like, first of all, the environment felt like it wasn't just background. They felt like part of the background.
3591000	3596000	And, even outside, the grass looked freaking real. Everything, the light sourcing was amazing.
3597000	3601000	I was really, really pleased. Of course, the voice acting was all in Japanese.
3601000	3611000	I always loved the Japanese Donald voice actor, because he just sounds so perfect. He sounds identical either way. It's great listening to it.
3612000	3624000	But, I'm really, really, really pleased by it. Apparently, they're also going to have Hercules, Big Hero 6, and Tangled in some of these worlds, which I'm also equally happy about.
3625000	3630000	So, really, really pleased with it. And, that and I like that they come out looking like toys.
3631000	3636000	You know, their little outfits are toy bodies. I think that's cute.
3637000	3646000	Yeah, I have to admit. I had heard about, they announced, I think the Toy Story was new this week. They talked about Big Hero 6 before. They didn't say a lot.
3647000	3650000	But, that was still, they're going to explore, I guess, a Marvel property with that.
3651000	3659000	It's weird that they're recycling Hercules. And, fuck James Woods, after this week, seriously. Fuck him. So, I'm not excited about that.
3659000	3663000	But, as far as, you know, the rest of those announcements, it's pretty cool.
3664000	3665000	I'm pretty pleased.
3666000	3672000	Yeah, yeah. And then, oh, did you see at the end of the trailer, Jamie, at the very end, at the very, very, very end, it says, coming in 2018.
3673000	3674000	Right. I saw that.
3675000	3682000	To which a lot of skeptical gamers are saying, hahaha, that's a good one.
3683000	3684000	Well, the other game I want is coming out next year too.
3685000	3686000	What's that?
3686000	3687000	The Dragon Ball FighterZ?
3688000	3692000	Oh, yeah, that will actually happen. That hasn't been in development for like 18 years.
3693000	3697000	Or, what's that gift from Titanic? It's been 84 years, or whatever it is she says in that movie.
3698000	3700000	It's how long it's been waiting for Kingdom Hearts 3.
3701000	3705000	And, here's the thing, I've also seen other people that are like, why are people so cynical about the 2018 release date?
3706000	3707000	It's like, come on.
3708000	3709000	Because it's a square we're talking about.
3710000	3713000	It's not even just that it's square. It's that it's square and it's a video game.
3713000	3718000	I mean, hello, every week on this show, every week on this show we have news about some game getting delayed.
3719000	3720000	In fact, I'm pretty sure we have some this week.
3721000	3722000	I know we do. I know we have one during Rapid Fire News, at least.
3723000	3725000	So, it just, it happens in this industry.
3726000	3729000	And I'm not saying, oh, I'm not saying like Kingdom Hearts 3 is gonna suck, because actually that's fine.
3730000	3733000	If they have to delay the game to make a great game, then it's fine.
3734000	3736000	But I just, I don't get excited over timeframes anymore.
3737000	3742000	Anybody remember that Persona 5 trailer that said it was gonna be on the PS3 in like 2014?
3743000	3748000	Remember that? I mean, games don't always make their dates and it happens.
3749000	3752000	So, anyway, hopefully Kingdom Hearts will be awesome when it finally does come out.
3753000	3754000	So, I'm excited about that.
3755000	3757000	But there's lots of awesome stuff at D23.
3758000	3759000	There was.
3760000	3763000	Yeah, the Tron ride coming to Orlando. Excited about that.
3764000	3765000	Very excited to check that out.
3766000	3767000	Was there any other gaming stuff?
3768000	3771000	Yeah, they showed off Battlefront 2, because I actually caught some of it.
3771000	3778000	They showed off Battlefront 2, they showed off, what else, a little bit more of Spider-Man.
3779000	3787000	They talked about, they had like a reveal of another character that you can play on Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2 game,
3788000	3792000	which is the homemade Spider-Man suit from the new movie.
3793000	3798000	Which I'm like, who cares? I mean, I kind of figured that would be in there anyways, but whatever.
3798000	3810000	And much like E3, it was chock full of influencers, if you will.
3811000	3812000	Disney has influencers?
3813000	3814000	No, YouTube personalities.
3815000	3816000	Oh, God. Alright.
3817000	3825000	So, it was hosted, they had Jacksepticeye doing hosting and then they had Markiplier in there later on and a whole bunch of other people I don't give a shit about.
3825000	3829000	But, it was cringey at moments.
3830000	3833000	I'm going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com. I have to address this comment.
3834000	3836000	So, sta100matt in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,
3837000	3843000	So, Mighty No. 9 gets tons of shit for delays, is a great game, but Kingdom Hearts 3 gets delayed and we have to gloss over it?
3844000	3849000	Nobody should be, except from, I think it's exempt from getting shit on for multiple delays.
3850000	3852000	Was Mighty No. 9 a good game? I don't remember hearing that part of it.
3852000	3856000	The juries, I think that's the whole opinion. There's an opinion there.
3857000	3860000	But, that's not even it for me. I'm going to tell you the difference there, Matt.
3861000	3867000	The Mighty No. 9 team took your money up front telling you the game was going to be out in a certain time frame.
3868000	3872000	I haven't paid a dollar for Kingdom Hearts yet, just like I haven't paid a dollar for Smash Brothers or any of that other stuff yet.
3873000	3880000	And, I think in the case of Mighty No. 9, it isn't just the fact that it got delayed, but it just seems like that Kickstarter.
3880000	3886000	Again, I didn't donate money to it, so I haven't been on the forefront of this. Although, I will say this, I did finally buy the game.
3887000	3892000	I just haven't played it yet. It's in my Steam backlog. I bought Mighty No. 9 in that recent Steam sale because I was like, I just want to see.
3893000	3897000	I want to make my own judgment on this. At least I can say that. I'm going to make my own damn judgment on this.
3898000	3900000	And, I'm not going to necessarily believe the internet one way or the other.
3901000	3908000	But, my understanding is those Kickstarter guys still fulfilling rewards. How long has that game been out now?
3908000	3912000	And, I'm hearing the last of the physical rewards just now going out.
3913000	3915000	Because it came out last July?
3916000	3924000	So, I think there's a little bit of apples and oranges going on there. And, the biggest part of it is that, again, they took your money up front promising a certain time frame.
3925000	3933000	But, to be fair, so did Bloodstained. So did a lot of Kickstarters out there. But, I think this is why you're seeing a trend.
3933000	3943000	I think more and more Kickstarters are having difficulty now if they aren't somebody with an established presence because of what these Kickstarters before have done.
3944000	3949000	Now, when Mighty No. 9 was a thing, nobody knew what to expect from Kickstarters.
3950000	3956000	But, now, it's almost like it's the same, and I'm using my quotey fingers, joke with Kickstarters. It's going to get delayed 100 times.
3957000	3963000	Here's the thing, and let's be fair here. We only hear about these Kickstarters when they're a shit show like this.
3964000	3966000	We don't hear about all the stuff that is successfully gone through.
3967000	3974000	And, I'm sure there's lots and lots of games that don't really hit the spotlight that have been Kickstarted and released just fine.
3975000	3978000	And, nobody's really talking about it because they weren't asking for a ton of money up front.
3978000	3985000	They released a good game or a decent game on time, and probably people playing it now don't even realize it was a Kickstarted game.
3986000	3992000	So, I don't want to say that all projects like that, but we can't take just, okay, this person's pedigree.
3993000	4002000	They made good games in the past with the publisher, and now they're releasing their own game that they're going to know what the fuck they're doing because that's been proven wrong a lot so far.
4002000	4012000	So, we just can't take that for granted, and you just have to see, in the end, is it something that you feel like putting your money towards the development on? Do you have confidence?
4013000	4014000	And, I mean, sometimes you're wrong.
4015000	4018000	Lizard Wizard in chat over at live.fognetwork.com says,
4019000	4021000	OLR never talked about the failure of Project Rap Rabbit.
4022000	4026000	Actually, I think the day before the campaign ended, I talked a little bit about it on the show.
4027000	4028000	They didn't show anything from it.
4028000	4038000	They finally, towards the end of the campaign, they finally had like a concept reel that I think was in-game footage, but maybe not. It might have been rendered. I'm not sure.
4039000	4055000	Anyway, here's my whole thing with that. Since you brought it up, I was actually going to bring that up anyway, but I would actually say Project Rap Rabbit is probably the first big victim, I would say, of a Kickstarter burnout that's happening, I think, in the gaming community.
4055000	4063000	I think if they did Project Rap Rabbit two years ago, before Amplitude ever happened, I think if they had tried to do it then, I think it would have succeeded.
4064000	4067000	I think I might have backed it. I don't know. It's hard to say in retrospect.
4068000	4080000	But I think a large reason why that game failed, A, they had an expectation because of all these, I still think, and I think some of the big fans of that game are going to really not agree with what I'm saying,
4081000	4090000	but you just, you really feel it in the sense of how long they held off on certain things and how they ran that whole Kickstarter. There was an arrogance around that Kickstarter.
4090000	4099000	I can't think of a better word. There was an arrogance around that Kickstarter that they were going to make their money, and I think that showed a little bit, which is why I'm using that word.
4100000	4101000	And I think that's part of the reason why they didn't make their money.
4102000	4104000	Shenmue 3, have we seen anything from that yet?
4105000	4114000	No. Oh, no. You know, and I think because of all of this, Mighty No. 9, Shenmue, Bloodstained, you name it, a lot of these high-profile Kickstarters that...
4115000	4118000	They didn't show footage at E3 of Bloodstained, and it apparently looked really good, but...
4118000	4130000	Yeah, I'm still... I did back Bloodstained. Would I do it again? I don't know, but I did back it, and it is looking good. I'm hoping maybe this is one that can kind of buck the trend and maybe make Kickstarters great again.
4131000	4139000	Like, there's a game, one that I've been seeing a lot on channels when they're talking about other stuff, so Fight Night was one. It's a game that's kind of got that old...
4139000	4152000	Like a retro first-person shooter-type game, but you're playing as a knight that all you do is you punch things. And it's got a really cool aesthetic to it, and it went through Kickstarter, and I think it's been doing pretty well.
4153000	4160000	And games like that, they release a demo along with the Kickstarter, so you kind of at least get to try it out and see if it's something that you want to...
4161000	4169000	Does this look good? Is this something you're going to be wanting in the backing instead of just basing it off of video? Pictures?
4170000	4183000	So anyway, yeah. The Rap Rabbit thing was just... It's a bummer, but I think there was a lot in there about how not to do your Kickstarter. Sorry.
4183000	4191000	But releasing gameplay concepts more than halfway in your campaign, that was a big no-no. That should have been a day-one thing.
4192000	4201000	And I think more people are going to have success on Kickstarter, like, okay, so talking about successful Kickstarters and things, and to be fair, let's talk about some good.
4202000	4211000	So we had that guy on the show a couple months ago from... Tangle Deep was the name of the game, and he is from OC Remix, right?
4211000	4220000	Yes, we had him on the show, right? And I actually backed that game, and I'm getting a lot of updates for it, and it seems like that game is on target.
4221000	4229000	But if you remember, when he was on the show, he talked about his game was pretty much already done, and it was coming out no matter what, but this was helping him do that final push.
4230000	4237000	It was the extra stuff he wanted to put in the game, and it was kind of like the distribution stuff. I think that was, in many ways, the right way to do a Kickstarter.
4237000	4241000	You already have your product ready to go. This is just now that final push.
4242000	4249000	And here's the best part about Kickstarter, though. If your project fails on Kickstarter, learn from your mistakes and do another one.
4250000	4258000	If, for example, Project Rap Rabbit, the problem was that there was no gameplay, there was nothing there, it was just kind of concepts at the 11th hour,
4258000	4267000	then maybe put some more stuff into your game, show some of what you have, and then do it again. I mean, no harm, no foul, I guess.
4268000	4273000	It's just when you make a game and you get funded and you don't release the game, then that's the problem.
4274000	4279000	SSJ100Matt says, Shovel Knight is the best case scenario and should be the standard of video game Kickstarter campaigns.
4280000	4285000	And that's a good news thing we can talk about, I think, when it comes to Kickstarter. It doesn't all have to be bad news, for sure.
4285000	4288000	And I think Yooka-Laylee was not so bad, from what I hear.
4289000	4294000	Yeah, I didn't pick that up myself, but I'm not hearing a lot of complaints about it. I think the people who funded it are enjoying it.
4295000	4300000	So, anyway. Alright, let's move on, though. We got plenty more to talk about than just what's going on on Kickstarter. Loki.
4301000	4306000	Alright, so there's a lot of VR news this week, especially Oculus.
4307000	4316000	Oculus announced that they're going to be creating a standalone Oculus headset that's going to release next year.
4317000	4323000	And it's going to be about $200. They're saying that the tech in it is going to be kind of similar to maybe a Gear VR.
4324000	4329000	So, I mean, I don't know. For $200, I would assume it's going to be like a Gear VR type thing.
4330000	4335000	But it's basically, it's not going to require a phone or anything like that. It's just going to be its own deal.
4336000	4341000	So that's going to be kind of neat. And especially $200, I mean, that's a pretty nice entry point.
4342000	4344000	So we'll have to see what that looks like coming next year.
4345000	4348000	The other stuff, though, in the meantime, this is a really good deal.
4348000	4354000	I mean, honestly, I'm thinking about jumping in on this. I just have to see if I have enough spare money to afford it right now.
4355000	4366000	But right now, between now and I think it's going to be running for six weeks, the Oculus Rift bundle on PC platforms is running $399.
4367000	4371000	So that's an Oculus Rift headset as well as two of the touch controllers.
4372000	4375000	And they're even including several games as well. That's $200 off the regular price.
4376000	4377000	Nice.
4378000	4390000	Fucking awesome. And on top of that, when the deal is up, they are going to be dropping the price down to $500 instead of the, what is it, I think it's $599 right now.
4391000	4394000	So they're going to be dropping in $100 permanently after the whole thing's done.
4395000	4401000	But, I mean, dude, that's, just seeing this, and we're going to kind of get into some more stories later.
4401000	4408000	A lot of companies are jumping on board VR, and I think it's really going to start taking off this year, probably next year.
4409000	4416000	Yeah, but I'm still worried about everybody trying to do VR their own way, and that we have a real, diluted pool here.
4417000	4418000	I don't have room for 10 headsets in my house.
4419000	4423000	Right. I think right now it's kind of between the Oculus, obviously the Oculus and the Vive.
4423000	4434000	I don't know, I know Lenovo's been doing, they have some other Lenovo headsets and stuff, and Microsoft is supposed to be partnering different people for different headsets, but I think, I don't have a problem.
4435000	4436000	PlayStation VR, of course.
4437000	4448000	Well, yeah, PlayStation VR. I think, though, this is good, though, that they're dropping the price like this, and it's helping push sales, because if they see those higher sales with this price point, it's only going to help, competition will bring that price down.
4448000	4459000	And that, I think, especially when this headset comes out standalone for $200, it may not be as cutting edge as this, which is okay, because not everybody's PC can run VR stuff as is.
4460000	4471000	And so, if this lower price headset isn't as demanding as other things, then maybe that's a good thing to get people really introduced into VR.
4471000	4479000	Because it's one of those things, like, once you try it, you kind of become a believer of it. So, I don't know, I'm interested to see where it's going to go.
4480000	4493000	Yeah, I think this is a nice, like, we knew eventually the price of the technology would start to come down a little bit, it would allow the price to come back a little bit, and now it's getting a little more like, okay, now this is something that, you know, more and more people might start adopting, so this is pretty exciting.
4494000	4500000	I am seriously, though, thinking about that bundle, because, like, now that my laptop can do VR, it's like, ooh.
4501000	4517000	Well, maybe this is something maybe to sway you, and surely you've seen stuff on this, Loki. Something else that was announced at the D23 Expo was Marvel Powers United VR, and this is actually a partnership, I guess, between Oculus and Disney Marvel.
4517000	4530000	So, I guess this is something where you get to, it's a four-player action game, you take on the role of your favorite Marvel hero, and you work together to complete missions, and you face off against bad guys and all that good stuff.
4531000	4532000	Yeah, it looked kind of cool.
4532000	4538000	Sanzaru Games is building it, they were behind VR Sports Challenge and Ripcoil, if you've played those games.
4539000	4554000	There's 12 playable characters, I guess they're supposed to be in the game, and so far you've seen Captain Marvel, Rocket Raccoon, and I guess the Hulk, sounds like was also there, so already a better roster than Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite.
4555000	4559000	I think they're actually all in Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite.
4559000	4571000	Alright, alright, bad joke. But anyway, no X-Men yet, that's a problem. Anyway, all that joking aside though, the VR stuff, yeah, looks like it would be pretty cool. This is something that I definitely want to play.
4572000	4580000	Dark Soccer, would you check out a game, oh maybe not, maybe because I know you're not big on the VR stuff because of the motion and everything, but you could be Rocket Raccoon.
4581000	4582000	That's okay.
4583000	4585000	You actually see his nose, which is kind of annoying, but you do have that.
4585000	4591000	No, I really don't care if it's VR, I'm not really going to play it every time of day.
4592000	4595000	But I remember at Gamer X you played a VR game you liked, so there's some stuff.
4596000	4598000	It was good, I liked it, but I couldn't.
4599000	4601000	But it was also not high intensity, something like this is high intensity, something like that.
4602000	4611000	Well this is high intensity, but it's not moving around a lot, it's more of just kind of standing there and shooting things. Like if you've ever played, you might like, what was that, Robot Recall thing.
4611000	4615000	Where there's not really a lot of movement, it's teleporting different spots.
4616000	4619000	I still don't think I would like it very much, I don't like to be without my glasses.
4620000	4621000	Well you could wear your glasses though.
4622000	4623000	I thought these headsets allowed you to wear your glasses.
4624000	4625000	I'm really not into VR.
4626000	4627000	Yeah, I don't know.
4628000	4631000	The teleport thing is how they're doing Doom and some of the...
4632000	4640000	I don't like it honestly, I don't mind, I don't get motion sick from that stuff and I don't really care for the teleporting, I would rather just be able to move.
4641000	4642000	Give me the option.
4643000	4648000	As long as I do it in little doses, I'm fine. I can't do a VR game for like an hour, but I can do it for like 20 minutes.
4649000	4650000	But I'm good.
4651000	4657000	I would like a sequel to, what was it, Until Dawn Rush of Blood, please, because that game is awesome.
4658000	4666000	I'll just keep playing that. I'm looking for more games, in fact actually one of the stories we'll have later on is a game I'm picking up and one I've been waiting for for PlayStation VR.
4667000	4669000	Alright, well let's move on so we can get there. But first, Dark Sakura.
4669000	4684000	Well, there is something that I don't know quite to think about it, but for anyone who is a fan of River City Ransom, the game River City Ransom Underground was taken off of Steam because of a DMCA claim.
4684000	4700000	And just trying to get a little bit more going on is that, basically, I'm not quite sure why because I think it was also involved in a YouTube thing. There's been some updates since I read this originally.
4701000	4703000	This actually follows something up from last week.
4704000	4709000	Yeah. I'm actually trying to find out because, like I said, it's been updated since I read it.
4709000	4717000	But basically, they're trying to get the DMCA retracted so that they can get it back on Steam.
4720000	4726000	And now there's something about a restraining order going on? Yeah, I'm like way behind on this one since I read it.
4727000	4734000	I was going to say, do you remember last week when we had the story about the composer who was taking stuff out? It's the same person.
4735000	4736000	Oh, is it?
4736000	4739000	Yes. There's the click, click, ding.
4740000	4753000	If I may jump in. So the whole restraining order thing they're talking about. So this is actually the whole litigation between Alex Mauer and Imago Software is actually heading to court now. There's already a court case going.
4753000	4763000	And so the first bit, they filed a restraining order against Alex Mauer in regards to filing copyright claims.
4764000	4777000	So she cannot file any copyright claims pertaining to the case that's in place right now because until that has been decided, who the owners are of the copyright, she can't issue takedowns anymore because she was doing it.
4777000	4788000	And in a really vicious manner, too, because normally now if you file multiple DMCA requests against a YouTube channel at once, it'll give you just one strike.
4789000	4798000	She was waiting enough time so that they would get individual strikes and take the channel down because she's just so vindictive against them. So on top of that.
4799000	4801000	Was she doing it all herself? She was doing it herself.
4801000	4814000	Well, there's also a little bit more you're saying now that they were, of course, getting more death threats from this individual and that they're not just being sent to the company, it's being sent to people associated with them as well.
4815000	4824000	And pretty much going now through as many different channels as to threaten people to leave her music alone.
4825000	4827000	Well, I had heard she was getting death threats, too.
4828000	4829000	She's making death threats.
4829000	4830000	What a mess.
4831000	4836000	First off, death threats on the Internet need to fucking stop. No matter who it is, fucking quit.
4837000	4840000	Right. So this is the Internet. People, when they're upset about something, do stupid shit.
4840000	4857000	And I mean, that's from the get go, both, you know, at the some of the YouTubers have been covering like Sid Alpha and then Leonard French, the plaintiff's lawyer is basically said, listen, stop making death threats against Alex.
4858000	4863000	You know, she is a person, you know, leave her alone, that type of stuff. So they have all basically come out and said, no, that's a bad thing.
4863000	4869000	Right. But she's been making death threats against them. She's doxed her own lawyer after firing her lawyer.
4870000	4874000	So she doxed her own lawyer. She doxed her parents for some reason. I'm not really sure where that comes into play.
4875000	4876000	Where's this all come from?
4877000	4878000	Mental insanity?
4879000	4882000	No, no, no, no, no, no. Not that. Like where what where is she doing this?
4883000	4886000	She's doing Twitter. She's doing a bunch of places. And here's the weird stuff, though.
4887000	4892000	The reason that we know this is because she's keeping email correspondence with these YouTubers like Sid Alpha, for example.
4893000	4900000	She keeps sending him emails telling him what she's doing and like he keeps responding back like, listen, if I can leave me alone, stop making.
4901000	4904000	I'm not taking your side. You've made death threats against me. You know, leave me the fuck alone.
4905000	4909000	So, I mean, it's just it's a really weird situation that's going on.
4910000	4918000	But the reason why she's going after the River City Ransom now is because she can't go after Starmazer or Starmazer DSP anymore because of this whole thing.
4918000	4924000	And she's doing that against River City Ransom and she was doing it against there's another game as well that she was trying to do takedowns on.
4925000	4930000	This is big, though, because if she if she ends up being in the wrong on this like this is this is now lost sales for this.
4931000	4936000	They've already shown the contract that she has. She is clearly in the wrong, but it's just.
4937000	4943000	I mean, it's just going to have to go through this whole court case and she's going to get in some pretty deep shit because of all this.
4943000	4949000	You know, they're going to. Does she have representation, a manager? She had she had representation.
4950000	4955000	She had a lawyer. They because they've been saying, listen, you should get a lawyer because she was going to represent herself.
4956000	4959000	They're like, you should get a lawyer. And so they got a lawyer. And that's where they went through this whole restraint or thing.
4960000	4964000	Apparently, she didn't like that. She fired the lawyer. And now she's on her own again.
4965000	4972000	It's it's a goddamn mess. Hmm. But like, yeah, it's I don't I don't want to assume nothing about people.
4973000	4979000	Oh, yeah. She's taken down like about seven. She's she's going to create a nightmare for herself if she is in the wrong.
4980000	4991000	She's already said that she's filed. She's given numbers and shown lists. She's filed 70 over 70 DMCA takedown requests against YouTubers, 50 different requests against Twitch streamers.
4992000	4997000	And just like causing all sorts of damage and bullshit. And it's not even because like she's trying to get after them.
4997000	5004000	It's because she was hoping that they will complain against, you know, the people that make the game to try to like kind of signal boost her shit.
5005000	5025000	And there is another thing to do into the article that I was getting a lot of the information from that really brought up some of it to me was written by Jonathan Holmes, who apparently has violated certain aspects of journalistic integrity by by commenting and reporting on things is specifically asked not to to basically more sensationalize the story.
5025000	5034000	I had to go in and issue a couple of retractions. That's what got me thrown off in the article, because the whole first part of it now is nothing but retractions and apologies.
5035000	5042000	OK, OK. Clearly, there are many things that everybody in this situation just needs to back away from.
5043000	5049000	So the reporters need to be back, which is ironic, but we're we're just three kids in a basement.
5049000	5059000	She needs to back away from the DMCAs. The companies need to back away from using her music.
5060000	5066000	I think we all just need to back away because there's no winners in the scenario. This is fucking nuts. Wow.
5067000	5072000	Yeah. Oh, boy. All right. Well, we're I think I think it's probably best we move on.
5072000	5077000	But that's it just kind of sucks that, you know, we were talking about this last week and now it's tied to, you know, a franchise.
5078000	5086000	I mean, Star Mazer, an indie developed thing. That's one thing. But now we're tied to River City Ransom, a, you know, franchise that a lot of people.
5087000	5098000	Some adult swims game or something like that, that she was because I remember she'd filed a DMC, a takedown nose against Turner broadcasting, which I'm sure I'm surprised that hasn't been in the ass yet.
5098000	5104000	But apparently it was for some adult swim game. I just don't remember what it was. Well, let me try to let me try to network.
5105000	5109000	Let me try to make a lemonade out of lemons in this whole thing. Maybe vodka.
5110000	5125000	OK, it's one way to do it. Maybe all this shit will finally have that conversation on YouTube and Twitch and all these places about when is it appropriate for somebody to send a takedown request, because I think this is also the conversation we need to be having.
5125000	5138000	And I think last time we brought this whole article up, I said, OK, well, she may be in the wrong, but who is who is pointing out that YouTube is in the wrong for issuing these strikes in the first place and letting her do it?
5139000	5143000	I'm using my quoting fingers, letting her do it. Where's where's YouTube's accountability?
5144000	5150000	And why aren't we why aren't we saying YouTube knock this shit off and stop being, you know, against your own content creators?
5150000	5152000	And this is something I was saying last week.
5153000	5162000	They can't do anything more than that because then the system is hot. It's impossible to police that much content and they can't.
5163000	5167000	I do think I would do it. They have to abide by these notices because they have to take them down.
5167000	5183000	That's the whole DMC law thing. But yeah, I think it's stupid that this system has been clearly abused by a lot of people, not necessarily just for, you know, by big studios who think they own everything, but also by people that I just don't like what you're saying in that video.
5184000	5189000	So I'm going to take it down. Right. And then then and then they purposefully know they're not going to go to the corridor on it.
5190000	5196000	They purposely hold it for the maximum amount of time that they can and release it, because fuck you, you just don't get paid for that many weeks.
5197000	5204000	It's stupid. All right. Let's move on. Some other news. I want to spend three hours on this. Loki.
5205000	5212000	All right. So Steam is working or should I say Valve is working on Steam's recommendation system.
5213000	5222000	So they're kind of revamping it. I remember I think this is kind of talking about how, you know, previously they talked about why things are getting recommended to you.
5222000	5234000	So you kind of have a little bit more details. But one of the things that they're working on instead of just basically saying, you know, yes, I want to like this title or no, I don't like this title or hey, you know, add that to my wish list.
5235000	5239000	They'll be able to choose games. They said based off of, you know, ones that they personally enjoy.
5240000	5253000	So they're hoping that with that and expanding their curators program will kind of make things a little bit nicer looking, especially that since it's kind of getting quite crowded in there now.
5254000	5258000	Yeah. Steam in general kind of just needs a makeover, I think.
5259000	5267000	Well, yeah. I mean, this is all stuff that they're talking about. I think it was like several weeks ago that they kind of talked about what changes they were going to be making to the platform.
5267000	5278000	Right. And I remember one was this whole recommendation system. Like they were going to basically say, okay, you know, okay, I have, you know, genital jousting in my, you know, hey, maybe you should check this out list.
5279000	5286000	Why am I getting this recommended to me? And it's like, okay, you've played several games with penises in them lately. So this is why.
5287000	5288000	You seem to be a fan of penis.
5289000	5291000	We see Age of Conan in there, you know.
5291000	5301000	Penis simulator 40, you know, 2017. So this is why you have that game.
5302000	5311000	Oh, Lordy. All right. Uh, moving on. Let's talk about some updates that have come to Xbox live. Uh, there's a update that is a hit.
5312000	5319000	I think that went off to all the users this week. I don't think it was just, um, or no, this, they will, they will be getting these updates soon.
5319000	5331000	Uh, some new things coming to Xbox include a custom gamer pics. So now if you don't like your gamer pic or your OLR icon that you downloaded in 2006 or whenever that was actually on the marketplace, you can't get it anymore.
5332000	5340000	Sadly. Um, but you can create your own custom gamer pic, which is pretty awesome. And what is also cool now, you can stream games with other people.
5341000	5347000	Cause you know how mixer added this whole, and it was a big part of their recent update. Now you can do the co-op streaming with other people.
5347000	5355000	Um, also, uh, you can actually tie a controller to your login. I guess that's kind of neat cause you can, uh, sign in a little easier and get things, uh, into it that way.
5356000	5367000	So, uh, yeah, that is all, uh, that is all coming out soon. I guess that's probably in the beta preview program right now. Um, but I am not sure when it's actually rolling out to the, uh, Xbox one itself.
5367000	5372000	Uh, mobile Xbox app also getting updates, which is kind of cool. So check that out.
5373000	5381000	Alright, let's go, let's go back to a simpler time in gaming though. Back, back when you didn't have, you didn't have firmware updates regularly.
5382000	5390000	You had the system that came in the box from when you bought it at Sears. And if you didn't like it that way, tough shit. You had to wait, you had to wait for the top loader NES.
5391000	5392000	So you didn't have to blow on cartridges anymore.
5392000	5405000	It's a segment on the show we call the classic game of the week, but plot twist in 2017 Dark Sakura takes a system every month and says, Hey, you know what? One game ain't enough for you.
5406000	5408000	Well, here's a whole damn system you should be spending some time with.
5409000	5412000	Yeah. Dark Sakura. What is the classic system of the month?
5412000	5427000	The ZX Spectrum, which is an eight bit home computer that came out in the UK released by Sinclair in 1982, manufactured in Dundee, Scotland in a former Timex factory.
5427000	5445000	At any rate, during development was called the ZX81 color and ZX82 and it came out as a ZX Spectrum because of its color display as opposed to the black and white that came out with the ZX81.
5445000	5460000	It had eight different models with the entry level being 16 kilobyte ram up to 128 kilobyte rams and a floppy disk drive in 1987.
5460000	5472000	And they sold roughly over 5 million units around the world, not counting clones of the hardware.
5473000	5478000	It was among the first mainstream audience home computers.
5479000	5482000	It was comparable to the Commodore 64 in the US.
5483000	5497000	And in fact, among its competitors were the Commodore 64, the Dragon 32, the Orac One, Atmos, BBC Microcomputer and the Amstrad CPC.
5497000	5504000	That was all over the 80s. It had over 24,000 software titles that came out.
5505000	5511000	And in 2014 there was a Bluetooth keyboard modeled after the Spectrum keyboard that came out.
5511000	5529000	And also after licensing deals and clones and the way that it boosted the UK IT industry, Clive Sinclair, I reckon the creator behind it, was awarded knighthood for services to the British industry.
5530000	5540000	So, among the varying versions that came out, like I said, the very first one came out with 16 kilobytes of ram.
5541000	5556000	It could be updated to 48 and the hardware was designed by Richard Altswasser of Sinclair Research and designed by Rick Dickinson.
5556000	5564000	It was RF video and it could use any type of television or a simple color display.
5565000	5574000	It was, I do believe, 32 by 24. Sorry, image resolution, I don't know what that was, that's text column.
5575000	5581000	Image resolution was 256 by 192 with the usual 8-bit color limitations.
5581000	5585000	But the pixel grid on it was 32 by 24.
5586000	5591000	And of course there were several other peripherals that had for it.
5592000	5598000	Sound was output through a beeper on the machine, as we can hear the bleep bleep sounds in the background.
5598000	5605000	Software could use the internal M-Play 2 channel sound.
5606000	5614000	It had an expansion bus edge connector. It also had headphone and mic ports as well.
5615000	5621000	And it used Sinclair Basic for most of the programming on the device.
5621000	5632000	There were, for all of the versions that came out, we had the ZX Spectrum 16K and 48K, the Spectrum Plus, Spectrum 128.
5633000	5641000	There were the Amstrad models, which was the Spectrum Plus 2, Plus 2A, Plus 3, just a number of them.
5642000	5649000	And then of course there were a ton of clones that came out because the hardware was licensed, including a few done by Timex of Portugal.
5649000	5663000	So it is considered, I would say, among the, I would probably say among one of the core of that 8-bit computer era.
5664000	5671000	I'd put it right up there on the pedestal with the Commodore 64, with the Atari 800 and later computers.
5672000	5674000	Of course, depending on your country, certainly.
5674000	5680000	Because, you know, here in the U.S. it really didn't make that same wave, just like the MSX didn't here either, you know.
5681000	5682000	I honestly would like one.
5683000	5685000	I mean, if someone wanted to just give me one, that's fine.
5686000	5696000	But amongst the other peripherals that came out with it, there were a number of branded items that came out in a few third-party things.
5696000	5702000	There was the ZX Printer, there was the ZX Interface, which looks like a cartridge attachment.
5703000	5705000	Interface 2, which is another cartridge attachment.
5706000	5709000	The Micro Drive, which looks like it is a floppy drive of some sort.
5710000	5711000	And the Chemston Joystick Interface.
5712000	5718000	A good number of different things that came out, but as far as software that came out, there were a number of...
5719000	5728000	I mean, not just, you know, doing database and programming and, you know, spreadsheets and even some early 3D rendering software that came out for it.
5729000	5733000	But there were just a good number of games.
5736000	5739000	Some of which, like in the video that I put, there was a Robocop game.
5740000	5741000	There were a number of them.
5742000	5745000	It also did have a cassette drive to load.
5745000	5753000	Now, I have a love-hate relationship with computers with cassette drives, because I had a Coleco Atom as a kid.
5754000	5758000	Power Surge Friar Tapes. Bye-bye, all magnetization.
5759000	5762000	I didn't realize that. That's crappy.
5763000	5765000	Yeah, no, it makes total sense, but crappy.
5766000	5773000	I have actually some Coleco Atom tapes that I'm fairly sure are also already wiped, but they're in the package.
5773000	5775000	Anyway, though, back to this one.
5776000	5786000	Software was distributed, you know, you could buy items. It could also be distributed through magazines and books, where you would just type the basic program and boom, there you'd go.
5787000	5789000	You know, kind of like in the old TI computer days.
5790000	5794000	There were problems, of course, with copying.
5795000	5802000	You could copy what they called the floppy ROMs, Flexesoft and Disco Flex. I just think Disco Flex sounds cool.
5803000	5805000	Don't copy that floppy. Disco.
5806000	5807000	Disco Flex.
5808000	5815000	But there were a number, of course, you know, piracy is nothing new.
5816000	5824000	There were also a good number of developers who went through some major game developers.
5824000	5829000	Several of whom went on to join Nintendo and Microsoft.
5830000	5839000	So we've got some really, really good talent that's programmed for it, although I'd say that not all of the games, you know, looked as great.
5840000	5842000	There were certainly better things that came out over time.
5843000	5844000	But, you know, there's a lot of love for it.
5845000	5853000	Also, some more recent things. In 2012, on April 23rd, the Google Doodle was the 30th anniversary of the Spectrum.
5854000	5855000	I don't need it.
5856000	5860000	And it was also on St. George's Day, so the logo of St. George fighting a dragon and the style of the Spectrum was the loading screen.
5861000	5875000	And then, January 2014, Elite Systems announced that Bluetooth keyboard that looks like the Spectrum keyboard to go with the iPad and other tablet devices.
5875000	5886000	And it was also announced, I'm trying to see, that there was going to be a Spectrum collection, but it was pulled.
5887000	5889000	So, sadness on there.
5890000	5901000	And then there was, through Indiegogo, a 100-pound Sinclair ZX Spectrum Vega retro video game console was announced.
5902000	5906000	But without a full keyboard and on a very limited manufacturing.
5907000	5910000	So, there you go. The ZX Spectrum.
5910000	5916000	All right. There it is. Your classic system of the month. The, if you want to say it the American way, the ZX Spectrum.
5917000	5919000	If you want to say it the old kingdom way, the ZX Spectrum.
5920000	5922000	Since it never came out over here, it only has one name.
5923000	5926000	Ah, okay. Fair enough. All right. There it is. And some rockin' music there.
5927000	5931000	Yeah, it sounds a lot like the Commodore 64 era stuff. Like, right, you know, same type of stuff.
5931000	5940000	The thing I like is that one of my favorite channels on YouTube, Battle of the Ports, will often include Spectrum versions when comparing port versions.
5941000	5946000	Evens done Amiga, Amstrad, Towns, a lot of those other systems that you don't hear from that much.
5947000	5952000	All right. Well, we're going to take a break, you guys. But when we come back, there's plenty more Orange Lounge Radio.
5953000	5954000	Orange Liquor Radio.
5954000	5962000	There's plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come, including rapid-fire news, some more news stories, your emails, and phone calls at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
5963000	5967000	When we come back after this break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5973000	5977000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio Live tonight.
5978000	5988000	Episode number 694 of our show already in progress for July the 16th of 2017. I can't believe this month is already halfway over. Crazy.
5989000	5998000	Anyway, we got some rapid-fire news to get into so we can get to release dates, your emails, some longer news, and phone calls at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
5999000	6001000	First, though, Loki with some rapid-fire news.
6001000	6021000	Yes. So the recently created real game of a mythical game, if you will, Polybius, is featured now in a new music video by Trent Reznor for his song Less Than.
6021000	6032000	They actually have footage of the game that was supposed to be this arcade game reportedly that was going to cause like nausea and headaches and anyone that played here or something like that.
6033000	6039000	But neat that it's getting featured now. That's supposed to be coming out in PlayStation VR pretty soon, so I don't know.
6040000	6047000	Yeah, I feel like Jamie did that as a classic game of the week once. Obviously not this envisioned version, but the legend or whatever. It was a while ago.
6048000	6049000	It's part of gaming history. Why not?
6049000	6061000	It is. Why not? Why not? Was that the same song they did on Twin Peaks? Because Nine Inch Nails was in an episode of Twin Peaks recently and I don't want to spoil anything, but that was a batshit, crazy episode of Twin Peaks.
6062000	6073000	That's all I have to say. I don't watch a lot of TV, but that is like the one show. I'm watching that and I'm watching a little bit of Riverdale when I can. So that's like it for my TV right now. But anyway.
6074000	6075000	Don't know.
6076000	6082000	And then of course the game I've been looking forward to coming to PlayStation VR is coming out actually next week.
6083000	6096000	So Superhot and Superhot VR coming to PlayStation 4 next week. And of course if you're not familiar with Superhot, Superhot is a first person shooter game where time doesn't move until you move.
6096000	6109000	So you basically have to kind of figure your way through the scenarios and kill all the people in very elaborate ways. All while, you know, taking time to account there.
6110000	6118000	So it's pretty cool. And the PlayStation VR version looks pretty awesome as well. You've watched the whole speedrun for during the Summer Games done quick.
6119000	6122000	So yeah, I am very interested. It's going to be coming out this week.
6123000	6132000	All right. Well, we were joking earlier this episode about game delays and how inevitable they are. And guess what? Another game got delayed this week. It's Ni No Kuni 2.
6133000	6135000	Oh my God. I'm sure Bobby is completely sad about this.
6136000	6148000	I think there was already some Twitter joke about it, but I just I overlooked it because Ni No Kuni 2, it was originally going to come out on November 10th of this year, already bumped back to January 19th, 2018.
6148000	6155000	But what's funny about that to me is that the original Ni No Kuni was a January release. Now I want to say it was like third week of January, just like this.
6156000	6166000	So it's kind of funny to me that this game is just following like the exact same footsteps of the first game in that regard. I just hope it has a better demo if they decide to release one.
6167000	6171000	Yes, Bobby says in chat, you know, the demo wasn't terrible enough, so they had to delay it.
6171000	6182000	Yeah, I was like, if they would just release a good demo for this game, then maybe I could fucking stop hearing it from Bobby about this series, but I'm not going to hold my breath. They're probably just not going to do any demo at all.
6183000	6194000	But this game is supposed to release on PC as well, right? They did announce in that video, yeah, the little subtitle there says PlayStation 4 and PC delayed to January 19th.
6194000	6202000	So that's kind of interesting that it's being released on both platforms at the same time, unlike the first game, which I don't think ever got released on PC.
6203000	6204000	No, it did not.
6205000	6207000	I still haven't watched that Castlevania thing on Netflix.
6208000	6209000	It was so good.
6210000	6211000	Oh, you finally watched it.
6212000	6213000	We watched it that night after the show last week.
6214000	6215000	Funny. So you liked it?
6216000	6217000	It was really good. I'm looking forward to there being more.
6217000	6232000	Well, how would you feel? Adish Shankar, I believe is how you say this name. He was the producer of the Castlevania animated series, and he was talking with Nintendo Life in an interview, and he was asked what other game series would he like to adapt?
6233000	6235000	Did you hear the answer to this already? You know the punchline that's coming?
6236000	6237000	Metroid.
6238000	6242000	Yeah, it's Metroid. Metroid is what he says he wants to adapt next. He'd love to do a Metroid adaptation in a similar anime style as Castlevania's.
6242000	6249000	He said Dark Metroid in the same anime style. So he didn't just say Metroid. He said Dark Metroid.
6250000	6254000	So Metroid Prime 4 is Dark Metroid confirmed. No, I'm kidding.
6255000	6262000	What do you think of that though, Dark Sakura? Hearing that and having seen the original Castlevania series, do you think a Metroid thing could be done like that?
6263000	6264000	Totally. Totally do.
6265000	6266000	That's a pretty high recommendation.
6267000	6268000	Yeah.
6269000	6270000	How about a Chrono Trigger adaptation?
6270000	6271000	No.
6272000	6276000	Chrono Trigger would have to be done by whatever studio Toriyama would work with.
6277000	6278000	Fair enough.
6279000	6286000	Or whoever is... I know the person's name and I forgot, but he's got a few people who have taken over the various Dragon Ball manga.
6287000	6289000	So it would be whoever his people work with.
6290000	6295000	Any other video games that you would like to see adapted as a Netflix series by Adi?
6296000	6297000	No.
6297000	6299000	No? Whatever he wants to do. Let us know.
6300000	6301000	Strider.
6302000	6305000	Oh, there you go. Strider. I like that. Okay. Nice.
6306000	6309000	Oh my god, you guys totally didn't pick the obvious one.
6310000	6311000	What?
6312000	6313000	The Guardian Legends.
6314000	6321000	I want a new game before they're allowed to do a TV show. Like look, Castlevania had like at least eight games.
6322000	6323000	What about Zelda? Let's do...
6324000	6326000	A Zelda anime though?
6327000	6331000	So we can like forget about the whole excuse me princess debacle.
6332000	6334000	But do I want to forget about that? Maybe I don't want to forget about that.
6335000	6336000	I want an HBO Zelda movie.
6337000	6339000	Oh, you want that? And how? HBO Zelda, why not?
6340000	6341000	Because tits and ass, that's why.
6342000	6345000	Is it Zelda like 16? What's wrong with you?
6346000	6347000	Oh, come on.
6348000	6349000	Who's gonna get naked? Impa?
6349000	6355000	It's like her 18. I mean that doesn't fucking matter. It's HBO. Don't introduce new characters.
6356000	6363000	It's not because of the plot. It's not because of the artistic direction. No, Loki just wants tits and ass.
6364000	6366000	There's fairies. They'll be naked.
6367000	6371000	No they won't. They'll be dressed like drag queens at Zelda. Hello.
6372000	6375000	Haven't you seen those fairies popping out of the fountains now?
6376000	6377000	They're queens.
6378000	6380000	Which drag queen should play a Zelda fairy?
6381000	6384000	Judging by the looks... Bob the drag queen, done. No, no, no, no, no.
6385000	6397000	If it was gonna be though dead on for the ones in Breath of the Wild, we're needing the level of over the top that can only be accomplished by Miss Alyssa Edwards.
6398000	6400000	She's gonna come out of that with a tongue pop.
6401000	6404000	And this is a weapon upgrade.
6405000	6406000	Exactly.
6408000	6410000	I can't pop loud enough.
6411000	6419000	Okay. There's a portion of our fan base that just doesn't understand when the show delves into this talk.
6420000	6422000	And then there's another portion of our fan base that goes, yes!
6423000	6425000	Yes, work! Right?
6426000	6429000	Alright, moving on. Dark Sakura, what do you have for rapid fire dude?
6430000	6432000	Oh lord. Not queens.
6432000	6443000	In news regarding BlazBlue, Jubay is coming. And it is apparently, I'm trying to see which Jubay it is.
6444000	6446000	Because there are many, many, many Jubay.
6447000	6452000	My mind went straight to Fatal Fury because there was a Jubay in that game, but it's not that Jubay.
6453000	6458000	It's not. It is the one from Persona 4 Arena, according to what I see here.
6459000	6467000	And also Ruby Rose from Ruby is going to be in the game too. So that's neat.
6468000	6476000	And then Jetta, who is like my favorite in Vampire Savior, is going to be in Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite.
6477000	6478000	That makes me so happy.
6479000	6481000	Yeah, but nothing else about Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite makes me happy.
6482000	6484000	Jetta and Shredder here, you make me happy.
6484000	6494000	No, no, seriously. I love Marvel vs. Capcom 3. I mean, that was awesome. Deadpool was in it. I mean, they had a really good cast of characters.
6495000	6497000	I'm going to wait for the game to come out.
6498000	6499000	I played the demo. Did you play the demo?
6500000	6501000	No, I didn't. To be fair.
6502000	6504000	And then Wallow in your disappointment.
6505000	6506000	So it's like a Ni No Kuni thing going on with the demo?
6507000	6509000	It's a bad demo. It's like, wow, this is crap.
6510000	6516000	By the way, Dark Sakura, I'm going to inject this here because we're talking about new characters in fighting games.
6517000	6523000	This came out after the show role was done, but before the show aired. Tekken 7 is getting a new character. Did you hear this?
6524000	6529000	Yes, it's Geese Howard. And then Dan started walking around the house going, predictable!
6530000	6538000	I'm like, okay, that makes more sense now that I saw that like a thread that was announced and I was like, that must be like an in game thing, you know?
6539000	6545000	It's one of his like attack quotes, you know, when he does his final or when he like counters a move.
6546000	6551000	Why that character from Fatal Fury though? I guess so. Why fucking not? I guess he does fit into the lore.
6551000	6553000	The intro was pretty mind blowing.
6554000	6560000	How can you do a Fatal Fury crossover and it not a Bogard or Joe or Mai?
6561000	6569000	The battle of the egos. Well, this is also listed as a second DLC. So I'd assume there would be more, but just the battle of the egos.
6570000	6574000	Because the whole intro was basically Geese Howard going, telling Heihachi he was an idiot.
6575000	6576000	That's true. It was.
6577000	6578000	What's wrong about that?
6578000	6583000	Dark Tetsuya thrown out there too in our chat. Also, I guess because Evo is obviously going on right now.
6584000	6586000	That's why we haven't been able to talk a lot about it because it's going on as the show is going on.
6587000	6591000	But I guess this just happened too before the show. Dark Tetsuya says Abigail was confirmed for Street Fighter 5.
6592000	6597000	So, I don't, I was hoping Jamie would know what game she's from. Is she a new character?
6598000	6600000	I haven't played hardly any Tekken since Tekken 4.
6601000	6602000	Street Fighter. Abigail.
6603000	6604000	In Street Fighter 5?
6605000	6607000	Fuck if I remember who that is.
6608000	6609000	I don't think she's from the Street Fighter franchise.
6610000	6612000	Is she a crossover character? I seriously don't know.
6613000	6617000	There's just too many cooks on the Street Fighter 4.
6618000	6622000	My mind keeps going back to Street Fighter 4 Ultra Edition where it's like there's a hundred characters to choose from.
6623000	6624000	It's an episode of too many cooks.
6625000	6628000	Oh, Abigail was Final Fight and Abigail's actually a dude.
6629000	6630000	Oh, really?
6631000	6633000	Yeah. An extremely large man with a flat top.
6634000	6636000	Oh, is that the picture I've been seeing?
6636000	6637000	Oh!
6638000	6639000	Wearing white pants and a chain.
6640000	6641000	Oh.
6642000	6644000	Yeah, now that I see the character, I just never realized that was the character's name.
6645000	6650000	Now that you described, oh yeah, that's right. It was a dude, a model that was Abigail.
6651000	6653000	I just never remembered that that was what the character was named.
6654000	6655000	Yeah, I just never remembered that either.
6656000	6657000	I always just paid attention to like, Poison.
6658000	6663000	Well, I never knew that her name was Poison either. I was just like the leather lady with the handcuffs.
6664000	6665000	Poison and Roxy who were...
6666000	6670000	Roxy and Foxy. I didn't know all the names in those games sometimes.
6671000	6676000	There's a big difference between that and like Chun-Li where the name is like huge on the screen as you're choosing it and all that stuff.
6677000	6679000	Alright. Thank you for helping us sort that all out here.
6680000	6681000	Fighting games. Lots of news.
6682000	6685000	Let's talk about some games that are in stores this week.
6686000	6689000	Things that you can pick up. Maybe some other fighting games this week being released, Loki?
6690000	6694000	Let's see. So, I don't know about any fighting games necessarily this week,
6694000	6699000	but there is some stuff coming out which, you know, usually this time of year is pretty next to nothing.
6700000	6703000	So, with this week we've got, and I have no idea what these games are,
6704000	6712000	but actually Children of the Zodiarcs. That's on PC, Mac, and Playstation 4.
6713000	6715000	Fallen Legion on Vita and Playstation 4.
6716000	6720000	Yonder, The Cloud Catcher Chronicles on PC and Playstation 4.
6720000	6724000	And then we've got Lone Echo on PC.
6725000	6729000	And then, of course, on Friday, Splatoon 2 on the Switch. That's it.
6730000	6734000	I'll be picking that up. Even if I only played like two rounds of Splatfest, I still want to pick up the phone.
6735000	6741000	And as I mentioned, of course, this week as well, you know, in our rapid fire news, Superhot and Superhot VR on Playstation 4 and Playstation VR.
6742000	6748000	Nice. Let's go to Japan right now. Let's get a plane. Go to Japan right now. What do you say, DarkSakura?
6748000	6749000	Japan.
6750000	6754000	Alright. Speaking of fighting games.
6755000	6766000	Let's see. Not a lot of releases this week on the Playstation 4, but you do have Under Night, In Birth, X, Late Street comes out this week in Japan.
6767000	6769000	That's on the Playstation 4. The Vita has some more stuff.
6769000	6775000	Rabbit Cross Labyrinth, Puzzle Out Stories, Farming Simulator 18. I know you're all hype about that.
6776000	6782000	And Dragon Ball Z, Battle of Z gets a price reduction. It goes into the Welcome Price edition from Bandai Namco.
6783000	6784000	So there is that.
6785000	6786000	I welcome that price.
6787000	6789000	I always welcome a good sale. The Switch gets some releases in Japan this week.
6790000	6794000	Cars 3 gets its release on the Switch, but also Fate Xtella.
6794000	6800000	That is also in a multi-language edition, so theoretically you could import that if you want.
6801000	6809000	Something you can't import unless you have a Japanese 3DS are some of these releases, including Yokai Watch 3, Tempura, and Sushi also getting price reductions.
6810000	6811000	Those games have been out, but they're getting a price reduction this week.
6812000	6819000	That's only going to cost you $24 to import them, so I think those are down to probably $18 right now, so that's a pretty good deal.
6820000	6823000	Farming Simulator 18 also getting its release on 3DS this week, however.
6824000	6825000	What about the UK, DarkSakura?
6826000	6834000	In the UK, we have a few things. On the 18th, we have Strike Vector EX and Yonder, the Cloud Catcher Chronicles.
6835000	6840000	Those are only on PlayStation 4 and PC. Strike Vector EX is PC only.
6841000	6845000	On the 19th, we have What Remains of Edith Finch for Xbox One.
6846000	6850000	And on the 20th, Fate Xtelle, the Umbral Star for Switch.
6851000	6852000	That is it.
6852000	6857000	Alright, let's go to the mailbag. Every week you guys send us emails.
6858000	6861000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send us emails.
6862000	6868000	And we dive into the mailbag and pull out our favorite emails to read here on the show.
6869000	6875000	When I say favorite, we really do. We read them all. Unless it's like spam or it says don't read this on air at the top.
6876000	6878000	Then we read it extra loudly, twice.
6879000	6880000	Here in studio amongst ourselves.
6880000	6881000	Yes, and they laugh.
6882000	6886000	Alright, let's get to it. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com. What's in the mailbag, DarkSakura?
6887000	6888000	Hello, LR.
6889000	6893000	Hi, YYR. I just have a few short responses to last week's episode.
6894000	6897000	Rob, your desire to voice a character in a game someday has been heard.
6898000	6901000	I have nothing further to announce at this time, but please stay tuned. Insert evil after here.
6902000	6903000	Yay!
6904000	6905000	And no, Rob, you're not getting too old for conventions.
6905000	6909000	If you start to feel that you are, though, just do what I do and act approximately half your age.
6910000	6912000	I do that on a daily, so...
6913000	6914000	You do that when you do dailies.
6915000	6916000	That's right.
6917000	6918000	That's it. Have a great week. Keep on smiling, Aaron, YYR.
6919000	6920000	Wow, that really was a short email from YYR.
6921000	6928000	But YYR, like, makes dreams come true. I think YYR should be, like, he's the genie. He's the official genie of OLR.
6929000	6930000	He makes our wishes come true.
6931000	6933000	Oh my lord, Ranma. What's with this long email?
6933000	6935000	He made a game out of poop for you, Dark Sakura.
6936000	6937000	Yes, he did.
6938000	6940000	Tell us that's not the OLR genie right there.
6941000	6942000	That was my dream game.
6943000	6946000	Hey, now, we've got the new genie, of course. That's gonna be Will Smith.
6947000	6949000	That's right. I heard that. The movie...
6950000	6954000	Here's the only thing I don't like. I don't really give a crap about the casting and all that stuff, although, you know, that's great.
6955000	6958000	I want that new trailer! I want that new Marvel trailer, dammit! Next week, I guess.
6958000	6965000	What? Every single movie from the 90s that Disney did, and animation, they're going back and doing live.
6966000	6967000	We've run out of ideas!
6968000	6973000	Except The Little Mermaid. The Little Mermaid is the one movie they haven't done, committed to yet.
6974000	6981000	But Aladdin, Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, like, they're doing them all, like, they're doing them all live now.
6982000	6986000	Because Beauty and the Beast made them money, and they're like, cha-ching, we're done.
6986000	6992000	And Bobby Blackwolf in chat, pointing out, you voiced Flappy Vog with a sad face.
6993000	6997000	But I didn't play a character in that game, I was myself.
6998000	7002000	And I recorded my lines in the rain in my car, far away from my office building, so no one could hear me making those voices.
7003000	7011000	And then on top of that, I was gonna say that the, what was it, what was the other Disney trailer that they had?
7012000	7014000	The Oprah Winfrey one. Nothing else matters.
7014000	7016000	That looked fucking awesome, and I love that song in the trailer.
7017000	7019000	Oh, the Sweet Dreams cover, yeah, yeah, yeah.
7020000	7022000	What was that, A Wrinkle in Time? Was that the movie?
7023000	7027000	Yeah, that looks awesome. I remember that book being creepy, and the trailer was creepy, so I'm gonna assume it's creepy.
7028000	7030000	If you didn't see that trailer for Wrinkle in Time, and I never get out to movies either.
7031000	7034000	I hardly watch any TV, I hardly ever see movies, I wanna go see that Wrinkle in Time.
7035000	7040000	But the only, I wanna point out, sorry, I know you got an email to get to, the only movie that fucking matters next year.
7040000	7045000	Mark a calendar, circle it. Mamma Mia 2. In July.
7046000	7048000	Yeah, it's really happened. They cast Young Meryl Streep and everything.
7049000	7050000	Is there a sequel to the play?
7051000	7052000	No. How about I read the next email?
7053000	7054000	Who cares? Abba. End.
7055000	7059000	Evening Rob, Jamie, and Loki. First of all, let me say Happy 15th. By the way, this is from Rama.
7060000	7065000	This email I have been meaning to send to y'all a couple weeks ago, but life came first. Don't you just hate that?
7065000	7070000	But anywho, there's a few things I do want to say. This email is kinda long, meaningful, but long.
7071000	7072000	Thanks, Rama.
7073000	7079000	Hearts. First of all, if it wasn't for OLR, there would not be an anime jam session. Truthfully, I hate writing.
7080000	7084000	I feel that writing, I am not able to get my thoughts down well. It's either too long or too short.
7085000	7090000	Podcasting allows me to get my thoughts out verbally, and I feel like it works out so well, uh, so well better.
7091000	7092000	Okay. Podcasting-
7092000	7099000	Clearly not a good writer. I'm sorry. I couldn't resist. No, no, no. And you know what? I'm joking because I'm right there with you, Rama.
7100000	7106000	I feel this exact same way. I do not like reading what I write, yet in a corporate environment, I'm okay.
7107000	7108000	I like writing much better than talking.
7109000	7110000	But even then, I always feel like I'm a better talker.
7111000	7115000	That's why my blog hasn't been put up yet. It's GoDaddy's fault. Anyway.
7116000	7121000	Podcasting has given, he said, men an extended life.
7122000	7126000	On going to conventions. As much as I love cosplaying, I've kind of burned out on it.
7127000	7139000	I worked as a vendor, and it wasn't for me. Now going to cons, cosplaying for a few, but then wearing my Vogue Network t-shirt, taking pictures, watching cosplayers smile when I take their pictures, and coming in on Tuesday nights to talk about my experiences.
7140000	7145000	Secondly, if it wasn't for y'all and Travis, I would not be able to teach others I know on podcasting.
7145000	7155000	I tell people that you don't need expensive, top of the line equipment. It surprises some people when I show off my equipment that it does not say Razor or some other fancy name.
7156000	7162000	To be fair, I do have a pair of Astro A40s I use, but I've been using, when I have been using for the past three to four years.
7163000	7171000	I've told people that this podcast is a labor of love. Everyone that works with me gives up some of their free time to help do the show, write articles and other great things for us.
7171000	7178000	I don't even know how much I've spent on doing this podcast. If I could take a guess, it would have to be over five grand.
7179000	7187000	I do not regret a single penny of it, because this is a labor of love. I really don't look at my numbers to see how popular the show is unless I need it for a press application.
7188000	7197000	And Rob, bless and testify. It makes my blood boil when I see other independent podcasts slash media outlets going to Kickstarter, Indiegogo, Patreon to raise funds.
7198000	7205000	You don't need a lot of money to have the best hardware or software, because truthfully, one could have that and it could still come up short.
7205000	7216000	Also, my staff has full-time jobs, so if make tiers to cover these conventions, there's no promise that my staffers can get that time off.
7217000	7229000	I have enough funds to cover said Con, let alone interview people at that convention. My Google FU is weak, so I can't look up that show you were talking about, but I agree with your thoughts on it.
7230000	7232000	Ask me off air. I'm not starting a fight on air.
7232000	7239000	There's another podcasting site that does something similar every year on Kickstarter, I'm not going to say it either, for BlizzCon and it burns me.
7240000	7245000	If my fans want to send me to a Con, great, but I will never ask them for a handout to do it. I will, just saying.
7246000	7249000	Okay, can I address a couple things here real quick? Sorry, it gives you a break in the email.
7250000	7257000	The Blizzard thing that he linked, I actually looked at, and it is actually, there's a difference here, and this is why I wanted to call it out.
7257000	7262000	At least the particular thing that he linked in the email was actually a Kickstarter I've donated to a couple years ago.
7263000	7272000	Because this Kickstarter was not about send XYZ person to said expo, but it was about let's do a pre-party, basically, for the expo.
7273000	7283000	I recognize that shit does cost money to do, they have to rent the ballroom and all this stuff, and so I think when it comes to those types of Kickstarters and stuff, that's fine.
7283000	7292000	And even at the end of the day, you know what, I understand that some people want to have a goal be to like, I want to get to, we'll say PAX.
7293000	7299000	I want to go to PAX, Penny Arcade Expo, and so, you know, if my listeners will help me collect the money, then I can actually go.
7300000	7303000	And at the end of the day, whatever you want to spend your money on is your business.
7303000	7311000	And I kind of feel that same way with the Patreon and stuff. I'm not, if podcasters want to go on Patreon, cool.
7312000	7319000	That's a choice for you, the podcaster, and your audience, ultimately, what they want to spend their money on. Cool. Like, that's fine.
7320000	7329000	Where my feathers got ruffled with that Kickstarter was because they set a number that, in my humble opinion from all the years of doing this, was way too fucking high.
7329000	7335000	And the way it kind of came off was that without this money, we can't do a podcast.
7336000	7342000	And that is specifically what ticked me off about that whole thing. Because I'm like, you can do a podcast for nothing.
7343000	7352000	You want this money because you want nice studio equipment. You want the nice to haves, not the need to haves.
7352000	7363000	That was the difference. But if somebody wants to do a Patreon, a Kickstarter, a Twitch tip bucket for the nice to haves, well, who am I to complain?
7364000	7370000	But here's the thing with the Patreon again. And I, even with Twitch, I'm starting to feel it a little bit.
7371000	7377000	Like, you know, my Twitch channel recently opened up so that people can subscribe. And I think I have four or five subscribers right now, which is awesome.
7377000	7380000	The fact that even one person wanted to subscribe is fucking awesome.
7381000	7391000	But I haven't been able to do much streaming in the past two weeks because of, you guys know I'm going through some real serious personal stuff right now with my mom and my family and stuff.
7392000	7396000	And it's not getting better. And that's all I'm going to say on it right now.
7396000	7405000	But I almost feel, like, guilty that I'm not streaming more because I'm thinking in my mind, like, fuck, I have subscribers.
7406000	7413000	Like, they're paying money and using their Twitch Prime to do it. And I know at the end of the day, these people, I know they're not, like, they totally understand.
7414000	7418000	I know reasonably everybody knows why I haven't been doing as much of that stuff recently.
7418000	7430000	It's just this weird, like, I can't explain it, you guys, it's just this weird mental block I have that it's like, when you are giving me money, I feel a bit of liability to produce content for said money.
7431000	7446000	Does that make sense? And that's what's held me back personally from the Patreon thing for a long time, is that if we were to start to take money for doing OLR, but then let's say some life circumstance happens and we have to end OLR in two weeks.
7446000	7455000	I don't know about you guys, but I would feel real guilty about taking that money. Because then OLR would be over. Does that make sense? Where my head is at with that?
7456000	7466000	Anyway, that's my whole thing. But if somebody wants to raise the money to go on a trip, I don't know if I want to put myself out there like that, but if somebody else wants to do it, and you want to give them money?
7467000	7471000	Alright, y'all know what you're buying, y'all know what you're funding? Cool. That's on y'all.
7471000	7475000	Anyway, I just wanted to clarify that. Jamie, sorry. Thank you for letting me.
7476000	7479000	Well, I was halfway through the paragraph and he did comment on what you already commented on.
7480000	7481000	Oh, my bad.
7482000	7486000	I know that these people are more than just BlizzCon. They host a party and much, much more.
7487000	7495000	Oh, come on. We all know where half that money goes. Hell, I see cosplayers doing this too, just to get new costumes or to do exotic shoots, etc.
7495000	7499000	I don't like it, but if they want to do this, these people want to give them money. Let them.
7500000	7507000	I'm going to be over here doing it my way. It's one thing where fans give you a few dollars to support you. It's another thing when you beg for it.
7508000	7510000	And, yeah, this one's to me.
7511000	7514000	And yes, Jamie, I do agree that it's hard when one of us aren't around for Tuesday night.
7515000	7520000	Ari has mentioned for how much of our show is a part of him and us not being here throws him off.
7520000	7534000	For me, it's ingrained in my Tuesday night routine. After work, I get Buffalo Wild Wings, do a little shopping at Target slash Stop and Shop, go home, watch NCIS or SmackDown Live for an hour, hop on Skype, quick prep and go.
7535000	7543000	Thank you for playing our little anniversary clip. I would have put it in Dropbox, but I didn't think Rob would check it before the show. My bad.
7544000	7548000	I've said it once. I've said it again. OLR is more than a podcast. We're a family.
7548000	7557000	There has been many times that you, Rob, have brought important topics to the table that we should be in the know about. And that's an amazing thing.
7558000	7564000	You have been there for me a couple of times when I needed it. And Jamie can tell you that she's been there for me a few times.
7565000	7570000	And on that same token, I am there for y'all. I will defend Rob, Jamie and Matt until my last breath because y'all's family.
7571000	7580000	Oh, and like I said before, I love doing this. I love investing all the time, money, effort, hard work into it, just so that other people see and enjoy the fruits of our labor.
7581000	7588000	And when I wake up one day and say it's time to wrap it up, so be it. I've had fun doing this for eight or so years. I think I've got another eight in me.
7589000	7596000	I think that's all I have to say about that. Love always. I don't know if you want us to use your first name, so I'll just say Ronma.
7597000	7601000	That was a really great email. Thank you. And that's really all I can say succinctly.
7602000	7603000	I have a lot of feelings about this.
7604000	7615000	Emails like that are worth way more than a few biddies. Not that I'm going to complain about the biddies. Don't get me wrong. I'm just saying emails like that. That's all the kickstart I need.
7616000	7620000	But I'm still waiting for a taco. I just want a taco.
7621000	7631000	Alright, last email. This comes from MXC. Hi MXC in chat. Do you folks have any thoughts about that upcoming Dream Daddy dad dating simulator game?
7632000	7634000	It looks funny. I hear it got delayed though, I think.
7635000	7644000	For me personally, it really bugs me how the marketing of the game attempts to sell the concept as utterly wacky a la Hataful Boyfriend and the idea of dating pigeons.
7645000	7654000	Then there's the Game Grumps Association, which also worries me, given they aren't necessarily known for being great LGBT advocates historically.
7655000	7669000	With that said, the developers have stated Dream Daddy is actually a serious story of a single father looking for love, which could be a great story for an individual novel to tell if treated with all respect.
7669000	7675000	Just curious what you think about it. We'll see if Dream Daddy is any good when it launches next week, regards to MXC.
7676000	7677000	Oh, I guess it didn't get delayed. I thought it already got delayed.
7678000	7681000	It was supposed to come out earlier this week and then they bumped it to Wednesday.
7682000	7684000	Oh, well that's not much of a delay, but no.
7685000	7692000	It's really hard for me to tell. I've certainly heard a lot about it. There's a lot of talk on Twitter about it and certainly the Game Grumps Association.
7692000	7704000	I must admit, I've actually never seen, but I know it's very popular with the kids, so I know that association is getting more increased visibility and so forth.
7705000	7720000	Certainly, I have some slight reservations because I don't want it to be a joke. I'm pushing 40 years old. I may not have kids, but I got a kitty, so I might be one of the Dream Daddies in this scenario and my life isn't a fucking joke.
7720000	7730000	But that being said, my understanding is that they have LGBT folks actually working on the game, that they are getting the consultation with that and all that.
7731000	7740000	I'm keeping an open mind that it can be done respectfully and if that's the case, then cool. That actually might end up being really fucking awesome.
7740000	7753000	That a group that's very popular with the YouTube generation and all this stuff kind of uses that power for representation and as we said at the beginning of the show, representation matters.
7754000	7761000	But just not when it's a joke. So as long as the game isn't a joke, which I'm not getting that vibe from a lot of the things I'm seeing from it.
7762000	7768000	So we'll see. I'll wait until the game's out and then I'll let y'all know how I felt.
7768000	7775000	Well, we did also have one more email that I had missed the first time around, so if we've got time for me to read it.
7776000	7777000	Of course.
7778000	7781000	Hey, OLR. Hope all is well. I wanted to talk about the EVO reveals for a bit.
7782000	7788000	Summary Showdown 5 Special for PS4 Vita. Sick! This seems to be the uncut version and hopefully the port is good.
7788000	7798000	I haven't seen any EVO footage of it yet, but I'll definitely get it as it's one of the very few fighting games I'm actually competent in and I am stuck with the damn boot. Hold on.
7799000	7805000	Dar Sakura's having to rearrange her positioning a little bit because her boot got stuck between the table and the chair.
7806000	7812000	Well, I have the table moved forward so that I can prop up the boot on it. It's just hard to move the thing around.
7812000	7813000	That's alright.
7814000	7829000	BlazBlue Cross Tag Battle. Um, yes, Lord, count me in. Not often that you get BlazBlue Ruby Persona 4 and especially Under Night In-Birth EXE late characters into one game for Slugfest. I'm pumped.
7830000	7835000	I haven't played anime fighters in quite some time, but shit, take my money and let's rock.
7836000	7838000	Geese Howard in Tekken 7. Predictable!
7838000	7853000	I expected Wei Wulong, but Geese is a great addition. Bandai Namco did say they were going to add more guest characters and they made a good impression so far. Can't imagine who the next character will be.
7854000	7866000	EX Fighting Lair. Well, it's definitely not a hoax. Slated to come out next year with a beta at the end of 2017. Wasn't too big into the Street Fighter EX series, but this looks pretty good. At least Skullomania is in it. I love Skullomania.
7866000	7868000	So they're remaking the 3D fighting game?
7869000	7870000	I reckon.
7871000	7872000	Cool.
7873000	7887000	But I also liked playing, um, Hokuto. MVC Infinite. It was good to see Jetta in action, but I feel more needs to be shown from the game. It's out in two months and we haven't received any official demonstration about the last two Infinity Gems, Mind and Soul.
7887000	7901000	I don't know that your Mind Gem Infinity Surge creates a copy of your character that mimics your attacks. The Soul Gem Infinity Surge revives your knocked out character. That makes sense since your knocked out character doesn't fade away.
7902000	7915000	Dragon Ball FighterZ. Future Trunks? Fuck yes! Just sign me up. More info for beta is coming on July 26th. Okay, you know what I want for this? If they put in Future Trunks, I want him to have his music from the other games.
7915000	7919000	It has to be there, because that would make me super happy.
7920000	7933000	I feel that 2018 will be a great year for fighters. The lineup is pretty diverse and there's something for everyone. What are your thoughts? Also, DarkSakura, I'd like to play you some time in some fighters. Feel free to add me on PSN, Steam or Xbox Live.
7934000	7946000	I will probably add you, but I'm going to let you know right now, I cannot play like I used to play. Not since having three surgeries on my right hand. So fair warning, you'll probably kick my butt.
7947000	7959000	But I would love to play some time. I'll just have to get back into practice. Although usually, because I just don't bother signing Dan out anymore, I'm usually logged in on PS4 under Dan's name.
7960000	7963000	Rob, I hope your mom gets better. She's in my thoughts and prayers.
7964000	7969000	Loki, I love your rants by the way. If I'm ever in NorCal, I'll buy you three a beer.
7970000	7974000	Thanks for taking the time to read my email and have a great week. Needle crash. Thank you, needle crash.
7975000	7986000	To respond to the question about the fighting, you know, how 2018 looks for fighters. I must admit, I feel like somewhere along the way I kind of slipped out of playing as many fighting games as I used to.
7986000	7993000	I'm still hoping for that Smash Brothers on Switch. That's the thing I really want more than anything right now.
7994000	8002000	But I do want to check out Tekken 7. And the Geese Howard thing even kind of made me perk up and go, oh yeah, I never did get Tekken 7 when it first came out.
8003000	8010000	I've got to keep my eye on that. So I might pick that up at some point, especially if I catch it on another sale. I think it was just on sale on PlayStation and I missed it.
8010000	8019000	But I do want to check out Tekken 7 at some point. So yeah, I just, I don't know. I don't do as well with the 3D stuff, but I know there's some good 2D fighters out there still too.
8020000	8026000	You know, especially what, BlazBlue is still 2D and all that stuff, right? So I just need to play more.
8027000	8034000	I'm probably still looking forward to Dragon Ball FighterZ. That's going to be the big one.
8034000	8041000	I just look at, every time I watch the videos of people playing it, I'm like, what? Give.
8042000	8051000	I'm going to crack and get Street Fighter V at some point. It's just a matter of time. It's kind of surprising I've gone this long without buying it, but I just haven't.
8052000	8054000	So at some point I'm going to finally get Street Fighter V.
8055000	8056000	When the Game of the Year edition comes out.
8056000	8060000	Exactly. With the final edition with all the crap. That's kind of what I'm waiting for.
8061000	8068000	Anyway, thank you guys for the emails. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send your emails if you want to have an email read in the future.
8069000	8072000	In the meantime, we have a few more stories for you guys before we get to calls at Orange Lounge Radio. Loki.
8073000	8079000	Hey, more talk about VR. Actually, this is a little bit talk about Unity as well because Unity just rolled out.
8079000	8088000	They showed off, I want to say it was during one of their Unite conferences, but they had a, it's now Unity 2017.
8089000	8097000	So they dropped the whole 4.5 moniker for that and now they have this whole 2017 thing which includes a lot of cool stuff.
8098000	8107000	Their new cinematic content, timeline features, as well as adding support for Nvidia VR works to render VR more efficiently.
8107000	8121000	So what does that do exactly? So they have, for example, support for multi res shading, which is a technique that renders basically the main parts of your display.
8122000	8130000	So everything that you're kind of looking at in a higher resolution than say the outside edges where the distortion would kind of make it look a little bit messed up anyway.
8130000	8138000	So they render that less with a less resolution so that it's not as noticeable, I guess, a little bit faster.
8139000	8150000	They said lens matching shading, also single pass stereo or in the new simultaneous multi projection architecture and VR SLI.
8151000	8155000	So performance when there's multiple GPUs or better performance.
8155000	8162000	Neat. A lot of stuff I probably won't end up using unless I someday decide to develop a VR game.
8163000	8166000	But yeah, I download it, of course.
8167000	8172000	It kind of still ties into the whole fact that VR is just growing and growing as it gets more accessible to make for in Unity.
8173000	8179000	Well, they sell most of the, like I would say like a vast majority of the content out there is made with Unity for VR.
8180000	8183000	So it's, I don't know, it's definitely out there.
8184000	8192000	All right. Well, there's a fan made project out there that I can't believe hasn't already been cease and desisted by the time we're doing this show, but it hasn't.
8193000	8195000	It's out there. So you want to go grab a load it now. Yeah, exactly.
8196000	8203000	Anyhow, this is a, I guess you could say it's been inspired a little bit by Mario maker, but this is a game featuring mega man.
8204000	8208000	That's right. It's mega maker. Actually, I don't think the game is out. It's just a trailer that's out right now.
8209000	8210000	And that's how you not do it. Exactly.
8210000	8221000	Mega maker is using assets for mega man, one through six, I guess over a hundred different tile sets, uh, 12 robot masters, original chiptune inspired soundtracks, uh, made by cosmic gem.
8222000	8229000	That's pretty cool. The game itself will be free. Uh, and I guess they're trying to do that. So actually it is available for download.
8230000	8236000	If they charge for it, they're going to, uh, they're going to get screwed on that. So, uh, this has been development since September of 2016.
8236000	8245000	Um, so there you go. You say, Oh yeah. Cause it was set to launch on July 15th, which uh, yeah, mega dash maker.com and you can check it out.
8246000	8255000	And I would grab that now before, I mean, granted cap calm isn't Nintendo, but I don't know y'all when, when somebody does mega man universe,
8256000	8261000	the way we all thought mega man universe was going to happen when somebody just kind of like did that. I don't know.
8261000	8270000	It may not last very long through the lawyers, so be careful or who knows, maybe, maybe, um, that one gal that's doing all the cease and desisting will cease and desist this too.
8271000	8276000	Cause somehow she'll think that she owns somebody did a chip tune to one of her songs in the game and then that then it'll all be over.
8277000	8284000	So just, uh, I go grab that as soon as you can. No, I see. I was trying to read a little bit more about this here. Um, it doesn't really show a whole ton.
8284000	8292000	However, I did see that there's a part here, like other things you can download that come with it, a warp world, which is for Twitch integration.
8293000	8298000	So I'm wondering if that's some sort of like where they have a Twitch chat integration or something.
8299000	8305000	Oh, maybe. Cause that's a big thing on Mario maker is that people will like play my level and here's my code. And then, you know, they go play the levels.
8305000	8314000	So, which by the way, I'm going to be doing on tonight's, uh, OLR poster. I haven't done the poster myself in like a month, so I'm doing it tonight.
8315000	8323000	Uh, and I'm going to play Mario maker. So, and I am willing to play some of y'all's levels. So get the codes. However, I am not interested in hell levels.
8324000	8332000	You don't want to play a castle of carnage. If the whole point of your level is me dying 500 times, just don't bother.
8332000	8340000	It's not impossible when you compare it to like some of the other levels. I did pass it a few times. Um, but yeah, that's very hard.
8341000	8350000	All right. So anyhow, but I'm willing to play your standard difficulty or lower Mario Kart or Mario Kart, Mario maker levels, but we'll get into that after the show.
8351000	8356000	In the meantime, we have some more news to get to, uh, including a little, a little callback, right? Dark Sakura.
8357000	8359000	I guess.
8360000	8363000	Yes. A callback. Yeah. Something cause you already brought this up earlier in the show. Sorta.
8364000	8369000	Yes I did. Yeah, absolutely. Oh, is it my turn? Yeah. Sorry. I was yelling at someone on the internet.
8370000	8372000	Sometimes it has to be done.
8373000	8385000	Well, I was bringing up the ZX spectrum earlier. Now, another thing that people may or may not know about me, I'm a fucking big Radiohead fan and Radiohead did something really, really cool.
8385000	8394000	Um, with their re-release of Okay Computer, which was a great album by the way, and this re-release costs, um, a hundred pounds.
8395000	8411000	Um, they have, uh, an art book, a collection of notes that were penned by Tom York, who is a very interesting individual to read his blog, um, a limited edition vinyl of the album and a C90 cassette.
8411000	8419000	Now, the C90 cassette has a bunch of Radiohead demos, but the last two minutes of it is computer screeching.
8420000	8427000	You know, when they tell you, this is a PlayStation black disc. Do not play the first track. Thank you, Alucard.
8428000	8439000	Anyway, um, people ran it through a ZX Spectrum emulator and found out that it's messages from, uh, the, uh, from the band.
8440000	8445000	Congratulations, you found the secret message of Sidli-, is it Sid Lives or Sid Lives? Uh, hmm.
8445000	8458000	And, um, then it says we should get out more. So there you go. It is a, uh, a little Easter egg for those who were fans of the ZX Spectrum.
8459000	8470000	I love that. I would love to do, I, you know, don't be surprised if in the future at the end of an OLR episode, there's some screeching and it'll end up being a Commodore 64 tape.
8471000	8473000	And just be me complaining.
8473000	8483000	Yes, it'll be, it'll be a typed Loki rant, or I'll just insert, you know, I ain't never had a sugar daddy, but if I wanted a sugar daddy, I could get one because I am what, bitch? Sickening.
8484000	8487000	I think I'll just put that at the end of one of the episodes in a Commodore 64 format.
8488000	8489000	I would just be incoherently screaming.
8491000	8495000	But that's, you don't have to put the tape in a Commodore 64 to hear that, Darcira.
8498000	8500000	Alright. What, what's on my fan?
8501000	8502000	Uh, two owls.
8503000	8504000	Owls will kill a bitch.
8505000	8506000	No, hearts, love, love forever.
8507000	8511000	I know. What's on my, my fan? I have a big middle finger with a political statement underneath it.
8512000	8513000	Mine's cute because it has owls on it.
8514000	8515000	Alright. Uh, moving on. Loki, what do you have?
8516000	8522000	So of course, um, Pokemon Go is going to be having its first event pretty soon actually in Chicago.
8523000	8524000	Saturday. Yep. Yep.
8524000	8528000	Um, so with that, of course, not everybody can make it to Chicago to play Pokemon Go.
8529000	8532000	So they have stuff going on, um, in case you're not nearby.
8533000	8544000	So if, um, you are in Chicago, of course, you'll be able to that day, I guess they're going to have different time challenges and you'll have to collect certain types of Pokemon.
8545000	8550000	And apparently if they catch enough during those windows, they can unlock perks for players globally.
8550000	8561000	And during those periods, players who aren't in the area can extend the length of those unlocked bonuses by catching their own Pokemon during those times.
8562000	8572000	And I guess if you catch enough, um, monsters worldwide, another secret challenge will be unveiled in Chicago, which could unlock an extra special bonus across the globe.
8573000	8575000	It's going to be another fucking hat. I know it. Fucking Pikachu hat.
8575000	8584000	I think it's going to be a legendary monster will show up at gyms around the world. That's what I think it'll be.
8585000	8594000	There was a, there was a leak of something from the iTunes India store or something that was an ad that said, now featuring raids and first legendary Pokemon.
8595000	8598000	So let the legendaries are fucking happening on Saturday. It's just a matter of how they roll out.
8599000	8600000	And they'll be in all the gyms.
8601000	8602000	Yeah, that's, that's what they'll do.
8603000	8611000	Yeah. You know, I don't know if it'll necessarily be like Artuno and the, and the three, it might be Mewtwo though. I think Mewtwo is a good candidate for who's going to get unleashed, but we'll see.
8612000	8621000	I mean, who knows anything can happen, but all I have to say, if you are lucky enough to be going to the Chicago event, if you're going to Grant Park on Saturday, you need to fucking unlock the Stardust bonus.
8622000	8625000	That should be your number one priority. That's the one fucking thing we don't get enough of in the game.
8626000	8630000	Stardust, Stardust, Stardust. You better be fucking getting us the Stardust bonus. That's all I have to say.
8630000	8632000	So what bonuses are they supposed to have?
8633000	8640000	Uh, there's a little mini poster out there somewhere and I don't have it in front of me, but one, like, it's like if they catch grass Pokemon, it's a Stardust bonus.
8641000	8648000	Another one is like walking, like reduces the distance for walking. Another one is like, I don't know, there's just a bunch of stuff.
8649000	8653000	Pretty much all of them have been in a holiday event previously, except the Stardust thing.
8654000	8659000	That's why I'm like, you need to get the fucking Stardust because that you cannot have enough Stardust ever.
8660000	8664000	So yeah, and it's, it's harder to even get it now. I mean, you can kind of get.
8665000	8668000	Okay, so if you do fire types, it's a candy bonus.
8669000	8671000	Not you, Chicago. Chicago has to do this.
8672000	8679000	Fire types is a candy bonus. Water types is an XP bonus. Grass type is a Stardust bonus.
8679000	8681000	Get all the grass. Get all the grass. It's a part.
8682000	8694000	Electric is egg distance bonus. Rock is buddy distance bonus. And whatever the hell that is, I guess that's normal, is encounter rate bonus.
8695000	8702000	And then they're saying that rewards, bronze is increased bonus duration by 24 hours. Silver, 48 hours. And gold mystery challenge unlocked.
8703000	8711000	And I'm going to go out on Saturday and play just to kind of contribute to this. And, you know, it's a good, good excuse to go out for a walk.
8712000	8717000	So there you go. Help contribute. Yeah. Yeah.
8718000	8722000	So 200 Matt says I'm tired of saving two months worth of Stardust and spending it on leveling up a Pokemon twice. Exactly.
8723000	8726000	We need a Stardust bonus. Bad. So make that happen.
8726000	8733000	All right. One more story for you guys. Then we're going to open up the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
8734000	8743000	And it has to do with, okay, so have y'all been to the gas station? Like, I don't know. It's not, I don't think it's a particular, like, I don't know if it's like Chevron or something or whatever.
8744000	8749000	But you go in the gas station and let's say you buy something at the store and when they ring you up, it makes the sonic ring noise.
8750000	8751000	Yes, I've noticed that.
8751000	8762000	Because like the, I love that. Like whenever I'm in the gas station, I hear that. And apparently the reason why that happens, I never knew this, but apparently the reason why that happens, this has to do with Sega's ties to pachinko.
8763000	8771000	And so through the pachinko mechanisms, this got licensed to some of those systems. Okay. Now there's a new one that's hitting gas stations.
8772000	8779000	It's not the sonic noise, but what it is, it's the song of time from Zelda.
8779000	8780000	What?
8780000	8792000	Yeah, I know, right? It's not at their cash register. It's apparently at a car wash. Somebody posted this to Reddit and check this out. I'll play the video here. It's not the best quality, but if we listen carefully, you can hear it.
8797000	8802000	Oh, it's not even playing. That's why. If the video will play on my end, we can hear it.
8803000	8808000	Except this is gonna hang up on me live on air. Let me try this one more time. I'm gonna reload the page.
8808000	8809000	Reload!
8809000	8818000	And try to play that for you. But yeah, you can actually, and this video is floating around the internet. It's over on Reddit. It's actually somebody pulled up at a car wash, and the car wash is actually playing the song of time.
8818000	8826000	Let's see if I can get it to go one more time here. And maybe they took down the video? I don't know. But yeah, it's not playing for me now.
8826000	8827000	It's probably your computer.
8827000	8835000	Yeah, it's probably this old, old computer I used to broadcast the show. Well, you'll just have to believe me. It's playing from the little car wash thing.
8835000	8844000	It's funny, but I don't think Nintendo would ever license their stuff like that, so it's so weird that something like that showed up in one of those car wash things.
8846000	8852000	SSJ100map points out a song of storms would have made sense, but I'll take it. When you go in that car wash...
8852000	8855000	Oh, there it goes. I was gonna say, to be fair, it's not playing on mine either.
8855000	8864000	It finally started. Well, all it is is somebody playing. They're holding up their cell phone as they're at the car wash. It's not the best quality.
8864000	8873000	But somebody posted a link in our chat. I just thought it was funny. I thought it was funny. It's on Reddit, in the Zelda Reddit, if you want to see it for yourself.
8874000	8881000	Anyway, fine. I just want an excuse to talk about the sonic ring noise at gas stations, because, come on, video games IRL.
8881000	8886000	Skype line is open. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype if you want to give us a call.
8886000	8892000	And talk about whatever you'd like. Something you saw that's been going on in gaming news this week, or something else that tickles your fancy.
8892000	8896000	In the meantime, I'm gonna check in with Loki to see if there's any last minute stories.
8897000	8898000	I don't know, but I...
8898000	8903000	I thought there was one thing I didn't put on show roll that I thought you might cover. The Star Wars AR. I guess you addressed that so much.
8903000	8904000	Oh, yeah, yeah. I guess I'll talk about that.
8904000	8914000	So, yeah, one of the weird things that they showed during D23 is that Lenovo and Disney are making an AR headset.
8915000	8920000	Which is like, what the hell? So they're making almost like a hololens in one of the games...
8920000	8923000	So Disney Infinity didn't work out, so let's put out another peripheral.
8923000	8924000	So let's put out, yeah, this.
8924000	8928000	And so what, of course, the first thing that they're gonna use with it is Star Wars.
8928000	8935000	And so they actually, it comes with like a light saber with like a, imagine like a stubby, you know, beam on it.
8935000	8938000	And I guess in the game it adds all the extra stuff in there.
8938000	8948000	And it's supposed to be, from what I gathered, the training thing that Luke did with the blast shield and how he's fighting the little drone robot thing.
8948000	8949000	Oh, yeah, yeah.
8949000	8951000	So it's supposed to be like training that and stuff.
8951000	8958000	I'm just always, you know, don't get me wrong, like, AR sounds cool and I hope this is cheap and I hope it's good.
8958000	8965000	But after Kinect Star Wars, I'm always wary when it comes to motion Star Wars games.
8965000	8967000	I'm like, ah, I don't know.
8967000	8969000	After Star Wars Kinect?
8969000	8973000	After Star Wars Kinect, I'm like, ah, man, you were willing to put your name on that.
8973000	8975000	Chewbacca dancing on him.
8975000	8980000	To be fair, I think that was before LucasArts was purchased by Disney, so hopefully...
8980000	8982000	That was before LucasArts was purchased.
8982000	8984000	Hopefully their standards are much higher.
8984000	8986000	Making better decisions, let's say.
8986000	8993000	But I'm interested to see what it is. I know Lenovo's getting into, I think they're doing VR headsets too for like Windows holographic and stuff.
8993000	9003000	So I'm curious to see how expensive it is, what software is on there, because I'm not buying a platform if it's just like one game or some shit.
9003000	9006000	You know, I need this to have some actual games with it.
9006000	9013000	Let me do another shoutout for our Skypline. Orange Lounge Radio, it's open right now if you want to give us a call.
9013000	9020000	The other thing too is they showed off some actual videos, so one of the other things they had was Star Wars, there was a battle going on in your living room.
9020000	9029000	And it did look kind of janky, so I'm guessing that was real footage that they're showing, and not like this hololens footage that looks way better.
9029000	9031000	The original Pokemon Go trailer.
9031000	9037000	It looked like real footage, so definitely go check it out if you're interested in finding out more about that.
9037000	9041000	The footage that they showed us is interesting, I guess. It's kind of gimmicky.
9041000	9049000	Kaijuto in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says it would be cool if they made a FaceTime app in AR that shows your friends as Star Wars holograms.
9049000	9052000	Well, if Snapchat can do all that stupid shit.
9052000	9060000	That was one of the things they were talking about. With Star Wars, we've had holograms and stuff in Star Wars, and we wanted to make that into your house.
9060000	9068000	Actually, one of the games that they announced was that 4D chess thing that they had. It's in Star Wars.
9068000	9069000	Oh yeah, in the cantina, yeah.
9069000	9072000	Yeah, so you're supposed to be playing AR chess and stuff, you can do that.
9072000	9073000	Nice.
9073000	9082000	I mean, I don't know, it's alright. I didn't get too excited about that. I wasn't like, oh shit, I gotta buy that. I was like, wow, they're making a headset? That's weird.
9082000	9085000	And then the Marvel thing is kind of like, that's neat.
9086000	9095000	Alright, one more call out for calls. Orange Launch Radio, all one word, on Skype. I guess everybody's watching the chairs of swords and all that stuff, so there you go.
9095000	9098000	Anything else, Loki?
9098000	9103000	No, but Mega Maker looks pretty cool.
9103000	9104000	Did you already download it and fire it up?
9104000	9108000	I downloaded it, I'm looking at the screenshots though. I'm curious to see how the level sharing works in that.
9108000	9110000	Yeah, I wanna check that out.
9110000	9113000	But I mean, I can see this as something that streamers will be playing around with.
9113000	9119000	I'm sure. Well, but can Twitch make a category for it? I don't think they can. I guess they probably have to be in like, other.
9119000	9129000	Because it's not, I think Capcom's gonna take issue to it. I mean, we'll see. Maybe Capcom will embrace it. Maybe they'll say, oh, this is publicity.
9129000	9132000	Can you put an ad for Mega Man Legacy in the beginning of it?
9132000	9135000	Honestly, I'm surprised that they didn't put out something like this.
9137000	9139000	Missed opportunity, I know, I know.
9139000	9141000	I mean, they still have the license for Mega Man.
9141000	9146000	Well, Mega Man Universe kind of looked like that's what it was gonna be. We'll never know.
9146000	9154000	And you know, not really gaming related necessarily, but they did release the first shot of Ready Player One, the movie.
9154000	9155000	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
9155000	9161000	And of course, San Diego Comic Con, they're gonna have a Ready Player One movie panel with Steven Spielberg. I'm hoping for a trailer.
9161000	9162000	Ah, there'll be a trailer, you gotta get shot.
9162000	9166000	But yeah, it is coming out next March, so I am very excited by that.
9166000	9167000	Nice.
9167000	9178000	It was pretty cool. They showed, like, he's got his, you know, trailer that he's in with his headset and the haptic gloves, and he's got, like, an omnidirectional treadmill thing in the fucking suite.
9178000	9186000	Alright, we'll see. Comic Con, yeah, so what, we had D23 this week. Comic Con's next week. I mean, there's a lot of conventions.
9186000	9195000	I should have mentioned this in Housekeeping, but I'll mention it now. Dragon Con is only, like, six weeks away, and of course, if you're anywhere near Atlanta, you should be going to this event,
9195000	9201000	because certainly Bobby Blackwolf and I will be there. I think there will be some other VOG folks there as well, I'm pretty sure.
9201000	9207000	John's coming, and I think Brian from British Invaders is coming this year, I think I saw on Facebook.
9207000	9211000	So, but don't hold me to that, because I have a bad memory sometimes.
9211000	9215000	But there will certainly be some other VOG personalities there, and yeah, I'm very excited.
9215000	9223000	I don't know what panels, but I know there will be at least a panel. There should be at least one panel, and hopefully a few more, so that'll be fun.
9223000	9233000	And just hanging out. No par six this year, which is unfortunate, they've moved that to virtual, but that just means another night, I don't have to be sober.
9233000	9235000	Because for the par six, I had to be sober.
9235000	9237000	No you didn't.
9237000	9241000	Well, that's true, I didn't have to. But I'm a professional, Loki, I'm a professional.
9241000	9245000	He just called out the wrong name, that's what they do in the major, like, award ceremonies anyways.
9245000	9251000	I wanted to be asked back in future years, but now I don't have to worry about that. So there you go.
9252000	9260000	Alright, well, our phones aren't lighting up, I guess y'all are being shy, or you're multitasking, doing your TV, and your HBOs and all that.
9260000	9264000	They put out the trailer for Dragon Ball FighterZ, showing Future Trunks.
9264000	9266000	Oh yeah? Oh, from EVO?
9266000	9268000	Yeah, it's pretty nice.
9268000	9275000	S2100 Matt, also pointing out, speaking of conventions, MAGFest registration, including hotels, will be going up soon.
9275000	9280000	Seems like August, yes, I love what they're doing with MAGFest hotels, they needed to do this years ago.
9280000	9288000	They are now going to require a one-night deposit on the Gaylord up front, and they're only sending the link for hotel reservations,
9288000	9292000	which everybody has a unique one, so you can't just, like, send the link to all your friends.
9292000	9296000	They're sending the link for hotel registration when you buy a ticket.
9296000	9302000	So, none of this, like, everybody mass trying to reserve on day one, just to hold it and then cancel it the day of.
9302000	9307000	So, I love what they're doing there for MAGFest, that's great, and so I'm excited.
9307000	9314000	MAGFest isn't guaranteed for me, y'all. It is not a guarantee right now, it just depends on a lot of factors.
9314000	9318000	I want to make it happen, but right now it's not a guarantee, but it's definitely on my list.
9318000	9320000	But I'll let you know as things develop.
9320000	9323000	So, it is a long way for me, though, remember guys.
9323000	9325000	About that trailer, by the way.
9325000	9326000	Yeah.
9326000	9328000	I reposted it to my Facebook fan page.
9328000	9329000	Fun.
9329000	9330000	So, I'll link it in the chat.
9330000	9331000	Awesome.
9331000	9336000	Alright, well, I think we are going to wrap things up here at Orange Lawn's Radio.
9336000	9342000	I know it's a little bit of a shorter show tonight, but we mentioned it was going to be lighter on the news and those things happen.
9342000	9343000	So, we're going to wrap it up, though.
9343000	9348000	We'll be back in seven days to talk about whatever gaming news might kind of come out of Comic Con or whatever happens.
9348000	9349000	There should be something.
9349000	9350000	There should be something.
9350000	9351000	Whatever happens during the week.
9351000	9359000	I hope we find out something, like, I mean, it's been, we haven't heard anything yet, but remember that whole Square Enix Marvel thing.
9360000	9365000	I imagine that's still kind of early in development and that may be hiding out until E3 next year still.
9365000	9366000	Yeah, maybe.
9366000	9367000	We'll see.
9367000	9370000	I'm not going to get my hopes up too much on that, but yeah, don't get me wrong, I'd love to see that.
9370000	9371000	We'll see.
9371000	9373000	Alright, that's it.
9373000	9374000	We're done.
9374000	9377000	Thank you guys so much for listening to this week's episode of Orange Lawn's Radio.
9377000	9381000	As we always say here at Orange Lawn's Radio, if you enjoyed what you heard, I'm not going to ask for your money.
9381000	9388000	I mean, if you want to send money, I have a Twitch channel and I think other folks have ways so you can contact them as well.
9388000	9389000	I have money.
9389000	9390000	There you go.
9390000	9395000	However, all we really ask is that you tell a friend or five about the show.
9395000	9404000	Spread the word because we're the show where every gamer has a voice, but if we got more people, maybe there'd be people that want to call in instead of watching Game of Thrones or whatever.
9404000	9406000	So yeah, just help us spread the word.
9406000	9411000	A nice five star review on a site like iTunes or Google Play or wherever it is you found this show.
9411000	9414000	That goes a long way as well, so we really appreciate those.
9414000	9417000	That's going to do it though, but first, final thoughts.
9417000	9424000	I'd like to add, if people do want to give anything less than five, feel free to do so, but let us know why.
9424000	9427000	If you're going to leave feedback, be constructive.
9427000	9429000	Oh yeah, that's yeah.
9429000	9433000	And you know, well, I always say five star reviews because those are the ones that help.
9433000	9435000	But if you're going to leave something less, that's fine.
9435000	9437000	But not like because they suck.
9437000	9439000	Like that doesn't do anything.
9439000	9441000	That's why I said leave constructive feedback.
9441000	9444000	Or the one there, I don't think it was on this show.
9444000	9446000	I think it was on a Hoard House and that was still around.
9446000	9449000	Somebody left a one star review saying another show was better.
9449000	9455000	And then I looked on that guy's reviews and it was all one star reviews on different Warcraft shows that this other show is better.
9455000	9459000	And I was just like, wow, you just made that other show look like a shithole.
9459000	9461000	And that's how you want to promote it.
9461000	9463000	Don't you ever do that in the name of OLR.
9463000	9466000	I swear to God, I say support indie podcasts, all of them.
9466000	9470000	If you, if this isn't a five star show for you, there's no shortage.
9470000	9472000	The guys on the show was better.
9472000	9474000	There's no shortage of video game shows out there for you to check out.
9474000	9479000	But my point is that if you're going to leave a review of any kind, leave feedback on it.
9479000	9481000	Or leave what you like, what you don't like.
9481000	9487000	Because no, on any show out there, no one is going to know how to improve unless you leave your feedback.
9487000	9490000	And make sure that you're not a shithole about it.
9490000	9492000	Make sure that you are not a dick.
9492000	9496000	And if it is going to be one star feedback, you could always just email it to us.
9496000	9500000	Participate at OrangeNonsRater.com. You don't have to post it on iTunes for everybody to see.
9500000	9502000	All right. All right.
9502000	9505000	But you can, I'm just saying, you can email us directly to our soccer with that feedback.
9505000	9507000	You don't have to post it.
9507000	9509000	Anyway, that's really going to do it though.
9509000	9511000	It's time to get everybody's final thoughts.
9511000	9513000	Loki, your final thought.
9513000	9515000	I'm going to try to work on my game some more.
9515000	9517000	I'm going to try.
9517000	9519000	No guarantees because...
9519000	9521000	We all know better.
9521000	9527000	My capacity for being able to program late at night, it varies greatly.
9527000	9535000	My final thought is I'm just about to the point in Final Fantasy XII where I'm going to pass how far I went on PlayStation 2.
9535000	9537000	So I'm really excited about that.
9537000	9539000	And I'm going to keep playing more of that this week.
9539000	9544000	So don't be surprised if next week's How Is Your Gaming Week was all about Final Fantasy as well.
9544000	9546000	Dark Sakura, last but not least, your final thought.
9546000	9549000	I'm going to dedicate a song to a mutual friend of ours.
9550000	9554000	Listen to The Gambler by Kenny Rogers and take it to fucking heart.
9554000	9556000	Alright.
9556000	9559000	That's going to do it then for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
9559000	9562000	Goodnight everybody. We'll see you in seven days. Bye.
