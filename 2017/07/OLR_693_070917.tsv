0	27000	On the heels of celebration comes the inevitable hangover as we learn of a few cancellations, extensions of life, and a look back at what may have been. We hope you still have all your fingers, eyebrows, and all other appendages intact so they can join us right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	45000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It's Orange Lounge Radio live tonight on July 9th, 2017 with episode number 693 of our show.
45000	58000	My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joined as I am every week over the last, you know, 692 episodes since it's 693 with my co-host. Say hello over there to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
58000	59000	Oh hi.
59000	60000	Hi, how are you doing?
60000	61000	I'm okay.
61000	63000	Did you have a good 4th of July holiday?
63000	65000	I stayed inside so it was great.
65000	66000	Yeah.
66000	69000	I had a bit of a headache and I didn't want to be around other humans.
69000	70000	Yeah.
70000	71000	So it was great.
71000	86000	I had a really terrible day but it got worse because somebody set off a firework at 3 in the morning and it sounded like they fired a gun. Like I seriously thought somebody got in our backyard to fire off a bottle rocket or something because it sounded like such a large explosion.
86000	87000	That sucks.
87000	102000	And I just, oh my gosh, it was so terrible. But I mean, we were able to, Alan's birthday was Friday so we got to go to Benihana. So you know, things got better but oh my gosh, I was like a zombie at work on Wednesday. It was so unfair. So unfair.
102000	109000	So I know it's a radio show so our listeners can't see your shirt but your shirt today says Slay All Day.
109000	111000	Slay All Day.
111000	113000	Where did you buy, where did you get that? Did you make that?
113000	114000	Target.
114000	116000	Target has a shirt that says Slay All Day?
116000	120000	I also have a shirt that says Can't Adult Today.
120000	122000	Target sell that too?
122000	123000	Yeah.
123000	126000	Wow. I had no idea that they sold such hip things.
126000	131000	It's like a sleeveless muscle shirt but this is what I wore to Pride. This whole outfit is what I wore to Pride.
131000	132000	Nice.
132000	133000	Including the boot.
133000	135000	Including the boot which you are still rocking.
135000	136000	It's split on the toe.
136000	138000	How much longer are you in the boot for?
138000	139000	Till the 25th.
139000	141000	Okay, well I guess that's manageable.
141000	144000	Which is right before California Extreme.
144000	145000	Yes.
145000	146000	I'm so happy.
146000	151000	Which I am. I am still planning to do California Extreme but I'm planning myself a long week.
151000	156000	Well I'm only going to go Saturday because I don't want to rush on Sunday because I'll be dead.
156000	158000	Maybe all that we're doing is Saturday.
158000	165000	I'm going to go to Rocky Horror in the City Saturday night and go visit my old pals on the cast over there that I used to perform with.
165000	169000	So that's my plan. So I'm going to have a very busy day on that Saturday.
169000	171000	But California Extreme, I'm really excited about it.
171000	174000	I haven't been in like seven or eight years.
174000	175000	Really?
175000	176000	Oh, it's been a long time.
176000	178000	Well, GamerX was the same weekend a couple of years.
178000	179000	That was unfortunate.
179000	181000	And then I don't remember what came up.
181000	184000	It's just, you know, trips or something always kind of held me back.
184000	186000	I want to rotate my foot.
186000	187000	Alright.
187000	191000	I want to make sure while you stretch your foot and do what you need to do, I want to introduce Techmaster Loki.
191000	192000	Hello.
192000	193000	How are you doing, Loki?
193000	194000	I'm fine.
194000	195000	So the 4th of July, a holiday about fire.
195000	197000	Surely one that you participated in?
197000	198000	No.
198000	199000	No?
199000	203000	No, the fireworks here suck so I'm not going to spend any money on them.
203000	210000	I mean, literally you can spend like one firework that they have that lasts for maybe 30 seconds is like 20 bucks.
210000	211000	No thanks.
211000	213000	They just get worse every year.
213000	217000	And I just didn't want to waste some of my money on it.
217000	219000	Yeah, the fireworks are not that great.
219000	222000	But you know what else is really awful is fires.
222000	226000	So I understand why they, well, especially when people are setting off the crazy stuff anyway.
226000	227000	I understand.
227000	228000	They do it anyways.
228000	237000	I don't think it would matter if they brought in the better fireworks because they bring in the better fireworks anyways.
237000	239000	I know some people love their 4th of July.
239000	245000	RideMyChocoboMan in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, I love blowing shit up.
245000	254000	Let's see, Bobby Black Wolf, our pal who's live before us at VOG Network on Sunday night says, I stayed home on July 4th and binge watched Doctor Who.
254000	258000	I figured that was the best way to celebrate Brexit 1776.
258000	265000	Yes, I know a lot of people were into the Doctor Who because the finale of this most recent season just happened, right?
265000	268000	So I'm a little behind on a lot of my television stuff.
268000	270000	If it's not on Netflix, I'm not watching it right now.
270000	272000	So I'm a little behind on some of this stuff.
272000	276000	I have to rely on the other VOG Network shows to keep me on that stuff.
277000	286000	Anyway, we are of course here to talk about video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle with you guys in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com
286000	292000	because we do tape live Sunday nights at 6 Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
292000	295000	So if you are listening to us live, head on into our chat room.
295000	298000	But if you're listening to us on the podcast feed, hey, that's great too.
298000	299000	You can always send us an email.
299000	303000	Participate at orangeonshreddy.com or you can always tweet at us at OLR.
303000	307000	You can probably send a carrier pigeon and it will probably find its way to us one way or another.
307000	312000	We invite you to participate in many different ways including the brand new Discord
312000	315000	which a lot of you guys have been showing up to which has been awesome.
315000	320000	So if you haven't checked out the new VOG Network Discord, be sure to head over to vognetwork.com
320000	323000	and under the participate banner is Discord.
323000	326000	And I believe that's just vognetwork.com slash Discord.
326000	329000	And that will get you the invite you need to get in there.
329000	335000	And yeah, we've been using that and I already have people talking to me when they see me playing Final Fantasy XIV
335000	338000	asking if I want to party up and stuff like that so that's kind of fun.
338000	341000	So yeah, check that out, our new Discord.
341000	347000	Meanwhile, I want to get into some game chat for the night including our kickoff topic tonight.
347000	353000	You know, it was a little bit slower of a news week with the 4th of July, a holiday happening in the middle of the week.
353000	358000	You had a lot of people that made it a long weekend last weekend or kind of took a couple extra days off.
358000	360000	So it kind of slowed the news cycle this week.
360000	365000	But next week is going to be a pretty big release, I think, for game releases
365000	370000	even though it is the re-release of a game that came out in 2006, I think.
370000	373000	So it's well over about 11 years old at this point.
373000	378000	Final Fantasy XII, although this time they are releasing the Zodiac Age version of the game
378000	383000	which is similar to what they did when they did the Final Fantasy X remaster and the X-II remaster.
383000	390000	They did a, like the international versions of those games were what we got as the release on Playstation 4.
390000	397000	So they're doing something similar to Final Fantasy XII which is great because I remember when the Final Fantasy X stuff came out
397000	401000	I think one of the things we all said was, wouldn't it be great if they did this for XII as well
401000	407000	because a lot of people kind of missed that game because that came out right as the Xbox 360 was taken off
407000	409000	and the PS3 was about to come out.
409000	412000	So Final Fantasy XII, I think a lot of people kind of overlooked.
412000	416000	So it's great that that's coming out and people get to re-experience that again.
416000	420000	So I want to actually talk a little bit here at the top of the show about remasters.
420000	426000	And you know, I know Final Fantasy XII is the one that's coming out this week that we all have to look forward to.
426000	433000	But, you know, certainly we've talked a lot on previous episodes about the Switch
433000	437000	and the remasters from the Wii U that we're seeing coming out on Switch
437000	441000	especially like Mario Kart 8 which has done very, very well for them.
441000	446000	We saw this week there were teasers. We don't know what to make of it.
446000	450000	But, you know, it's kind of like people are looking into these tweets and going,
450000	454000	oh well they said 2 and 1 and 2 plus 1 is 3 so Half-Life 3 confirmed.
454000	460000	But there was a tweet from, was it Kamiya that tweeted out or was it Platinum Games account?
460000	461000	Who tweeted?
461000	462000	I think it was the Platinum Games account.
462000	463000	I think it was the Platinum Games account.
463000	468000	Tweeted a picture of the Wonderful 101 and if you look over somebody's shoulder they're playing it on the Switch.
469000	476000	And then there was like a Bayonetta graphic that had the Bayonetta from her look in Bayonetta 1 and Bayonetta from her look in 2.
476000	483000	And it was like red and blue and they were kind of like on top of each other sort of like it could be a Switch.
483000	485000	Like they were Switched. Get it?
485000	487000	Okay, Half-Life 3 confirmed a little bit here.
487000	493000	But it has people talking all about those games potentially getting Switch remasters.
493000	497000	So I'm curious what you all think about, you can talk about these remasters if you want.
497000	500000	But remasters in general and I open this up to our chatters as well.
500000	505000	I don't consider those remasters, I consider them porting them to another system because they're not doing anything to them.
505000	507000	They're just re-releasing them on another system.
507000	508000	Second chances.
508000	511000	It's not even, yeah, I mean it's like that's not a remaster.
511000	515000	A remaster would be something like, okay, this game came out on another system.
515000	522000	Like the Halo collection or something like that where they completely redo all the graphics and the meshes and everything like that.
522000	523000	Crash Bandicoot.
523000	526000	Crash Bandicoot. Which is apparently doing really well.
526000	528000	Especially in the UK.
528000	535000	Which doesn't, I mean that franchise was always I think particularly larger over there on that side of the pond than it was.
535000	539000	I mean it was still kind of big over here but it was really big in the UK if I remember right.
539000	542000	So it's doing phenomenal over there from what I understand.
542000	545000	So even to the point where, and I hope I'm not spoiling a story.
545000	548000	I don't think it was one I showrolled but it was one that I was looking at.
548000	556000	That they've even kind of commented that like they're looking at maybe doing something with Crash Bandicoot in the future because this remaster is doing so well.
556000	562000	But it is truly a remaster and I realize we're kind of splitting Harris a little bit because you're right.
562000	566000	If you look at, let's say Bayonetta gets released on the Switch.
566000	569000	Is that really a remaster or is that a port?
569000	571000	It's a second chance is what it is.
571000	573000	Those games are a second chance.
573000	577000	You know it's a port running at like 1080p or something like that when...
577000	582000	Yeah, yeah. The PC one, like I bought Bayonetta on PC.
582000	591000	It's not really a remaster but it runs better than it does on the original Playstation 3 and so forth.
591000	596000	So, ok it's not a remaster but it's still a modernized version if you will.
596000	601000	And I would assume that even if they do end up doing the Bayonetta 1 and 2 thing on the Switch.
601000	606000	They'll probably throw something extra in there to sweeten the pot just because there are going to be...
606000	608000	Amiibo support, always fucking Amiibo support.
608000	610000	Oh yeah, good call, Amiibo support.
610000	614000	She'll wear a hat, it'll be like a Mario hat or suspenders or something.
614000	616000	That's a great idea.
616000	618000	It's a terrible fucking idea.
618000	624000	She'll wear a peach crown or she'll have the little Rosalina Luna following her or...
624000	627000	It'll be something stupid like that and everyone's like,
628000	630000	It's got Amiibo support, gotta buy it now.
630000	637000	Like fucking Skyrim on the Switch because it has support for Amiibos.
637000	641000	Alright, let's get to some comments and chat and then you guys can follow up to this.
641000	643000	JD in chat says,
651000	653000	And Dungeon Buster immediately follows that up with,
658000	664000	And I think that's why a lot of these games are getting their second chance life on the Switch for what it is.
664000	666000	Bobby Blackwolf says,
678000	681000	Yeah, I am and I'm not with you.
681000	684000	Like I kind of like the Journey thing.
684000	691000	I liked when they re-released Journey but I understand how not every game necessarily needs to see a second version.
691000	696000	But it is interesting because since the PlayStation 4 isn't fully backwards compatible with PlayStation 3,
696000	700000	I'm not going to count the PlayStation Now stuff because that's a subscription thing.
700000	708000	You know, some of these big games that maybe people who didn't buy a PS3 may be tempted with on a PS4.
708000	711000	But I do have to admit, to Bobby's credit on that comment,
711000	717000	I do have to admit, when I saw that Shadow of the Colossus trailer at E3 this year, I was kind of like,
717000	719000	Okay, cool.
719000	727000	I mean, I know a lot of people really like that game but this Shadow of the Colossus is a game that's getting a second remaster.
727000	730000	And I was like, that's interesting.
730000	732000	Well, this is more of a remake at this point.
732000	735000	Well, but look at Final Fantasy 4.
735000	738000	Final Fantasy 4 was on the Super Nintendo.
738000	744000	There was a great, great version on the PSP I bet many people never played because it was on the PSP
744000	747000	and I don't think they ever put it on anything else.
747000	749000	You might have been able to download it on the Vita.
749000	754000	I think that you download it on the Vita because back when Sony did backwards compatibility,
754000	756000	you could play the PSP thing on the Vita.
756000	757000	Yeah, you still can do that now.
757000	758000	That whole thing.
758000	761000	And yeah, I'm Shane in the PS4.
761000	767000	So they did that remaster but then there was also the 3D version that they did with the 3DS
767000	770000	which ended up being the version that they've also released on Steam.
770000	771000	And iOS.
771000	773000	And I think mobile devices, yeah, yeah.
773000	780000	So to be fair, Final Fantasy 4 has also been remastered twice and I've bought them all.
780000	782000	Have they remastered 6?
782000	784000	So I guess I can't shade Shadow of the Colossus too bad.
784000	786000	Did they remaster 6? I know they did 4.
786000	792000	Okay, they did do a remaster of 6 but it was the mobile version.
793000	796000	And I think they outsourced the graphics or something.
796000	798000	Like it just seems kind of...
798000	806000	It doesn't seem like it's gotten the same TLC that the DS remasters got.
806000	810000	Like it just seems like let's update the sprites and throw it out there.
810000	813000	And it kind of feels a little cheap to me.
813000	817000	And Final Fantasy 6 is not a game that deserves to be treated cheaply.
817000	819000	But that was my opinion on those.
820000	824000	I would love to see a remaster done like the Final Fantasy 7 remaster for 6.
824000	826000	For real, right?
826000	828000	It would be awesome.
828000	830000	When is this Final Fantasy 7 remaster going to come out?
830000	832000	I'll never. PlayStation 5 at this point.
832000	836000	Okay, now we're really getting into semantics now.
836000	840000	Final Fantasy 7 really isn't a remaster, it's a remake.
840000	845000	And I'm only nitpicking on that one because it is very obvious.
846000	850000	The Final Fantasy 7 remake is a completely new game.
850000	854000	But based off the shooting script.
854000	858000	It's like doing a movie based off the shooting script of the original movie.
858000	860000	You know what I mean?
860000	863000	They did Little Orphan Annie in the 80s.
863000	868000	And then they did that new Little Orphan Annie with Jamie Foxx and Cameron Diaz.
870000	871000	They do this in Hollywood all the time.
871000	873000	They take the old movie and then they modernize it.
873000	875000	And most of the time, it's not good.
875000	878000	But sometimes, it's pretty good.
878000	880000	I'm trying to think off the top of my head.
880000	882000	What were some Hollywood ones that were alright?
882000	884000	That they modernized and they came out okay?
884000	887000	I'm drawing a blank right now because I don't talk about movies as much as I talk about games.
887000	889000	Well, I mean, some people don't like this.
889000	891000	War of the Worlds I thought was pretty good.
891000	894000	But that's more of a redo based off I think the movie.
894000	895000	It wasn't necessarily...
895000	897000	Okay, but actually that's an excellent example.
897000	901000	Because War of the Worlds being that it was a huge radio thing, right?
901000	907000	Then technology got newer, so they did a movie based off it.
907000	913000	In a weird way, it's kind of like the technology for 7 was a lot older in the PS1 days.
913000	916000	And now they're using the technology for the PlayStation 4 version.
916000	919000	Yeah, because 7, man, now if you try...
919000	922000	It does not. It did not age well.
924000	925000	Let's see.
925000	926000	Vidpower in chat says,
926000	929000	I guess the definition of remaster is kind of blurry nowadays.
929000	931000	Yeah, it is. It really is.
931000	933000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says,
933000	938000	Well, wouldn't any movie based on a Shakespeare play be a remaster and a modernizing?
938000	940000	I guess in a way.
940000	944000	In a way, but I mean, they carry their own controversies now, don't they?
944000	947000	Remember when Baz Luhrmann did Romeo and Juliet?
947000	949000	I love that. It was fantastic.
949000	950000	I love that movie too.
950000	954000	I think it's something about how old you were when that movie came out.
954000	958000	Like if you were a teen around the time that movie came out, like you loved it.
958000	960000	And then like other people hated it.
960000	964000	Because I know people that just straight up hate that Romeo and Juliet reinterpretation.
964000	966000	But I loved it.
966000	969000	But I mean, in a way, yeah, Bobby.
969000	972000	I mean, I don't know if you're being sarcastic or not, but I kind of...
972000	976000	I kind of think, you know, when they redo those Shakespeare plays as movies,
976000	978000	sometimes they do it traditionally.
978000	980000	Like I think there was a Hamlet one a few years ago.
980000	983000	And sometimes they do it very non-traditionally.
983000	984000	And you know that you have that.
984000	987000	So, let's see.
987000	990000	I'm going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
990000	996000	JD says, I'm a lot less tolerant of movie remakes than for video games for some reason.
996000	1000000	E3VL in chat says, Jumanji is going to be horrible.
1000000	1002000	Oh, God.
1002000	1005000	Do you know, I literally forgot that was happening.
1005000	1006000	I forgot that was happening.
1006000	1008000	I tried to. Thanks for reminding me.
1008000	1010000	Thanks for reminding us, E3VL.
1010000	1012000	Now, go sit in the corner and think about what you've done.
1012000	1013000	I'm just kidding.
1013000	1017000	Jumanji was pretty good, but like, I get it that they're modernizing it.
1017000	1019000	And then there's all this stupid fan wink that they're saying,
1019000	1023000	well, the game just adapted itself to be more appealing.
1023000	1024000	Fucking no, it's not.
1024000	1027000	It's just trying to be...
1027000	1029000	Jumanji like was...
1029000	1032000	The first movie was based off of the book a little bit closer
1032000	1034000	because it was basically this game comes alive.
1034000	1037000	It starts bringing all this like dangerous jungle shit into the real world.
1037000	1039000	And they have to deal with it.
1040000	1043000	Granted, the kids' book kind of glosses over most of that stuff,
1043000	1044000	but I mean, that's basically it.
1044000	1048000	I remember the book was the thing that the teacher would read to the whole class.
1048000	1051000	Did y'all do this in school where the teacher would sit in front of the class
1051000	1052000	and read the book?
1052000	1055000	And then this happened, turn the page.
1055000	1058000	And like, yeah, I remember Jumanji was like that book.
1058000	1063000	Yeah, and the Jumanji, you know, the first movie was pretty good with Robin Williams.
1063000	1066000	And you know, it kind of like amped up how dangerous everything was.
1066000	1068000	This one is some fucking bullshit.
1068000	1074000	It's an Atari 2600 or 8-bit retro game that's called Jumanji.
1074000	1077000	And the kids get sucked into the game and they play their characters in the game.
1077000	1081000	And it's so hilarious because the hot chick becomes this nerdy guy
1081000	1085000	and like all this funny stuff because they're breaking their molds
1085000	1087000	and they're going to learn something about themselves.
1087000	1091000	And fuck this movie in its fucking ass because it looks terrible.
1091000	1093000	Slow your roll.
1093000	1096000	Why the fuck did The Rock sign this?
1096000	1101000	This is about as bad as when Brendan Fraser signed up for the fucking Journey to the Center of the Earth.
1101000	1103000	Money, money, money, money, money. It's all about money.
1103000	1105000	All right, let me ask you this. Calm down for a minute.
1105000	1106000	Go to a happy place.
1106000	1109000	I know this isn't totally games, but humor me for a minute here.
1109000	1110000	It's a slow news week.
1110000	1115000	Loki, let's say you are the next big Hollywood producer.
1115000	1118000	What movie would you remake and what would you do to it?
1118000	1120000	Would I remake?
1120000	1121000	Yeah.
1121000	1124000	I'd do a live action Macross franchise.
1124000	1126000	Oh, but you saw what happened with Ghost in the Shell.
1126000	1129000	I wouldn't be fucking stupid like that, okay?
1129000	1132000	I didn't have some fucking respect for the goddamn material.
1132000	1137000	Hire actors that are the nationality of the characters, okay?
1137000	1140000	We don't need a fucking Scarlett Johansson in the movie.
1140000	1142000	Just fucking make it good.
1142000	1144000	Why is that so hard?
1144000	1145000	Make it good.
1145000	1148000	Dark Soccer, I got to poke you with the same question.
1148000	1150000	And then I'm going to ask about games, Loki, so be thinking of that.
1150000	1156000	Dark Soccer, what would you remaster if you could go to Hollywood and any movie you could remake?
1156000	1157000	What would you do?
1157000	1158000	I wouldn't.
1158000	1162000	I'd do a new fucking franchise.
1162000	1163000	You refuse.
1163000	1167000	There's no movie worthy of modernization.
1167000	1171000	I'd make an actual Mass Effect movie.
1171000	1172000	That's what would happen.
1172000	1174000	Supposedly they were working on one.
1174000	1175000	Well, they're wrong.
1175000	1181000	I hope this shit with Andromeda does not push that movie off track.
1181000	1183000	I really don't.
1183000	1188000	I don't know, I would actually do an HD remaster of the first Dragon Age.
1188000	1193000	I'll tell you what, I'd go back and remaster and not remaster and make a fucking other sequel.
1193000	1194000	A new Tron movie.
1194000	1196000	Because fucking hell, we need a new Tron movie.
1196000	1197000	There you go, there you go.
1197000	1198000	Fucking remastered shit.
1198000	1199000	What are they talking about?
1199000	1201000	Like remastering with Jared Leto?
1201000	1203000	Fuck that.
1203000	1205000	It's such a terrible, stupid...
1205000	1209000	Hey, let's take this great franchise and fucking shove it into the ground, okay?
1209000	1211000	That's gonna be fantastic.
1213000	1216000	Okay, so what about games?
1216000	1219000	What game do you think needs to be...
1219000	1223000	And I posted this to the chat as well, you guys, over at live.vognora.com.
1223000	1224000	What game...
1224000	1226000	And you can go as far back as you want.
1226000	1234000	What game needs to be remastered, modernized for PlayStation 4, Switch, wherever you want to put it.
1234000	1236000	Xbox One, PC.
1236000	1241000	Well, I mean, the easy option, and I hope it's actually something that's gonna happen,
1241000	1245000	because I know they did a poll for it, would be R4.
1245000	1246000	I would like to see...
1246000	1247000	I want a new Ridge Racer.
1247000	1251000	I know that the last game that they did was like a fun fucking money grab shit.
1251000	1254000	And that didn't sell well for them, so good.
1254000	1255000	It shouldn't, because it was crap.
1255000	1256000	But like make...
1256000	1259000	R4 is probably the best Ridge Racer game that they put out.
1259000	1260000	Remaster that.
1260000	1263000	Make it look good.
1263000	1265000	You can add tracks from the other games.
1265000	1266000	I don't give a shit.
1266000	1269000	Just make another good Ridge Racer game.
1269000	1273000	I'm gonna tell you what game I'm thinking of when I'm asking this question,
1273000	1277000	and I think they're doing a phenomenal job with it, is Blaster Master Zero.
1277000	1281000	And you know I love that original Blaster Master game, and I like the new one a lot,
1281000	1285000	but what I'm really liking about it is the continued value of the game.
1285000	1286000	And we'll talk...
1286000	1290000	I know we have a story coming up on it later, but the DLC in that game is pretty outstanding.
1290000	1294000	We can get a Fester's Quest Zero, how about that?
1294000	1297000	I think Fester's Quest was kind of underrated personally,
1297000	1300000	because it was just the overhead shots from Blaster Master as a game,
1300000	1304000	but yeah, hell yeah, why not Fester's Quest re-updated?
1304000	1306000	Have like Fester in there as a special character.
1306000	1307000	Why not?
1307000	1310000	Oh my god, get Fester in the DLC for Blaster Master.
1310000	1312000	Like surely there's no licensing issues there.
1312000	1313000	Dar Sakura, what about you?
1313000	1315000	I'd already said Dragon Age.
1315000	1317000	Oh yeah, sorry, you said Dragon Age right at the tail end.
1317000	1320000	But what about like, um...
1320000	1324000	Oh, like Zombies Ate My Neighbors, or...
1324000	1326000	Yeah, I've always thought about that.
1326000	1327000	That's a good pick.
1327000	1328000	That's a good pick.
1328000	1331000	I am surprised you did not immediately say what I would be saying.
1331000	1332000	The Guardian Legend.
1332000	1334000	The Guardian Legend, yes, thank you very much.
1334000	1335000	TGL.
1335000	1336000	Thank you.
1336000	1341000	They've already redone Fantasy Zone with the Sega Ages collections.
1341000	1342000	Oh, true.
1342000	1348000	It had like the Sega 2800 or whatever it was.
1348000	1351000	The cheaper packages that were the 3D remakes.
1351000	1354000	So both that and Space Harrier have already been done,
1354000	1356000	so the Guardian Legend would have to happen.
1356000	1359000	And not just Gardic, we want Gardic Gaiden.
1359000	1361000	All right, let me go to chat over at live.familynetwork.com.
1361000	1362000	Some great answers to chat.
1362000	1365000	Bobby Blackwolf suggests Katamari Damacy.
1365000	1368000	That game's due for another chance.
1368000	1370000	They did a remaster of that not too long ago.
1370000	1372000	That was the one they did for like Xbox.
1372000	1375000	I mean, the later games, they just kind of said,
1375000	1377000	eh, we don't know how to make any new levels,
1377000	1378000	we're just going to bring those levels back.
1378000	1381000	It was the PlayStation 3 version, was like a best of...
1381000	1382000	No, it was the Vita.
1382000	1385000	Vita was the last proper release for that game, I think.
1385000	1386000	Yeah.
1386000	1387000	I think it's...
1387000	1388000	Enough time has passed.
1388000	1390000	Yeah, clicker games don't fucking count.
1390000	1392000	Um, let's see.
1392000	1395000	Especially now with like all the processors being able to handle
1395000	1397000	all these different objects and everything,
1397000	1400000	I would think it'd be pretty awesome to see what Katamari game.
1400000	1403000	J.D. says, Mother 3.
1404000	1406000	Well, you have to release it first before you remaster it.
1406000	1408000	You have to release it first, Tiger.
1408000	1412000	Oh, that was something that they were going off on the entire time
1412000	1416000	of several of the runs at Summer Games and Quick.
1416000	1417000	Yeah.
1417000	1419000	As they should.
1419000	1420000	I mean, for serious.
1420000	1421000	For serious.
1421000	1422000	He fucking...
1422000	1423000	They know that they want it released.
1423000	1424000	Why aren't they doing it?
1424000	1426000	Because they're being assholes.
1428000	1429000	SSG100Matt says,
1429000	1432000	OLR is due to get in trouble over a Katamari game again.
1432000	1433000	Oh, shut up.
1433000	1434000	Let's see.
1434000	1435000	Tigerclaw says,
1435000	1437000	I know one game that needs a remaster or remake,
1437000	1438000	and this one is very dear to you.
1438000	1439000	Super Metroid.
1439000	1440000	Why?
1440000	1443000	Because Nintendo is remaking Metroid 2, so why not?
1443000	1446000	Let me tell you why I don't want them to remake Super Metroid.
1446000	1447000	It was good the way it was.
1447000	1449000	Because you can't improve perfection.
1449000	1451000	You can't improve perfection.
1451000	1453000	All that laugh aside,
1453000	1455000	because I know that will get a reaction out of Bobby,
1455000	1457000	all that talk aside,
1457000	1459000	I would say, honestly,
1459000	1462000	I would just encourage them to do a new 2D adventure.
1462000	1463000	They don't have to be remakes.
1463000	1465000	I would go for a Metroid maker.
1465000	1467000	That would be kind of awesome, actually.
1467000	1469000	I like this answer from Dungeon Buster.
1469000	1473000	Fantasy Star, the first one as a Western release.
1474000	1477000	You know, a lot of the look and feel of Fantasy Star
1477000	1479000	really changed with Fantasy Star Online and stuff.
1479000	1482000	It would be very interesting to see the story of the original Fantasy Star
1482000	1484000	kind of in that environment.
1484000	1487000	But I would also just happily take, you know, PSO2 being released.
1487000	1488000	Black Wolf says,
1488000	1490000	Remaster Maniac Mansion.
1490000	1491000	I thought they did recently, didn't they?
1491000	1492000	They did.
1492000	1495000	Oh, no, they did Remaster Day of the Tentacle.
1495000	1498000	I thought they did Maniac Mansion too, but maybe not.
1498000	1501000	I don't think they did the remasters of all the...
1502000	1505000	Yeah, no, I think they only did Day of the Tentacle.
1505000	1506000	They never got around to doing Maniac Mansion.
1506000	1508000	They did all of the...
1508000	1510000	What's their prior game?
1512000	1513000	I played a ton of them.
1513000	1515000	Why can't I think of this?
1517000	1519000	It's bothering me, I can see.
1520000	1521000	I don't think about it.
1521000	1522000	But, yeah, they did...
1522000	1524000	They've done a lot of remasters in the past for their games.
1524000	1526000	I mean, I don't see why not.
1528000	1529000	Let's see.
1529000	1533000	I'm trying to look at a couple other comments from chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
1534000	1535000	Let's see.
1535000	1536000	That's why I was thinking of Monkey Island.
1536000	1537000	There we go.
1537000	1541000	Tigerclaw says, you can improve perfection with better graphics, better gameplay.
1541000	1542000	But that's...
1542000	1543000	The gameplay's perfect, though.
1543000	1547000	And sometimes, I'm sure we'd love to see in a marathon someday.
1547000	1551000	I suppose you could give it the treatment that StarCraft is getting.
1551000	1553000	With, you know, they're not really changing the game.
1553000	1557000	They're only changing the graphics and the way the internet part of it works.
1558000	1564000	Just have the team that does all the fucking cel-shaded shit for the Rayman series,
1564000	1567000	remaster that game, and leave everything else the same.
1567000	1569000	Just remaster the graphics.
1569000	1570000	Alright.
1570000	1572000	I guess I could go with that, for sure.
1572000	1575000	Bump up the lighting and make it all cool-looking.
1575000	1577000	Turn up the graphics on level 3?
1577000	1578000	Absolutely.
1578000	1579000	Alright.
1579000	1584000	Well, we'll see what the game industry has in store for remasters and remakes in the future.
1584000	1586000	But for now, we're going to move on with our show.
1586000	1588000	We're going to talk a little bit about our gaming weeks.
1588000	1590000	I'll go to Dark Soccer in just a moment here.
1590000	1592000	But first, some quick plugs.
1592000	1594000	Again, I do want to just mention, of course, our Facebook.
1594000	1596000	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
1596000	1597000	And we're also on Twitter as well.
1597000	1599000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
1599000	1601000	I already plugged the Discord, although I was going to do it here.
1601000	1602000	So, I'll plug it again.
1602000	1605000	The new Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.
1605000	1610000	And we should be here every show for the next few weeks.
1610000	1611000	I will mention this.
1611000	1618000	There will be no show over Labor Day weekend because, as usual, has been the case for the past few years.
1618000	1625000	I will be at Dragon Con in Atlanta that weekend along with Bobby Blackwolf and hopefully some other folks from VOG as well.
1625000	1630000	Very fortunate this year to be recognized as a professional at Dragon Con.
1630000	1636000	Very thankful to the podcasting track and buddies over there who really encouraged me to go for that designation.
1636000	1638000	And, yeah, it worked out this year.
1638000	1643000	So, I'm really, really looking forward to participating even more with Dragon Con as a show this year.
1643000	1645000	So, it's going to be a fun, fun year at Dragon Con.
1645000	1646000	Really looking forward to it.
1646000	1648000	But we won't be here Labor Day weekend as a result.
1648000	1650000	Most of you are traveling anyway.
1650000	1654000	But we hope, if it's reasonable for you, you'll be traveling over to Dragon Con.
1654000	1659000	Anyway, let's get into our gaming weeks and the types of video games we've been playing this week.
1659000	1660000	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
1660000	1664000	I have been playing Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2.
1664000	1670000	I actually didn't play any WoW this week, I don't think.
1671000	1678000	I've been playing my cell phone games and Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2. That's it.
1678000	1680000	Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball.
1680000	1683000	I'm kind of rediscovering the love. It's been pretty fun.
1683000	1684000	Yeah, there's nothing wrong with that.
1684000	1691000	And I think I've watched now every episode of Dragon Ball Z again, just fast forwarding past the fillers, like in the last week.
1691000	1698000	And I have to say this up front because I did poll everybody in the room before we did the show tonight.
1698000	1702000	But none of us did get around to watching that Castlevania anime, so we can't really talk about it tonight.
1702000	1704000	Do you plan to at some point, DarkSakura, watch it?
1704000	1705000	Yeah, probably this week.
1705000	1714000	Yeah. I'm okay with it only being four episodes because that makes it a lot easier to kind of consume, if you know what I mean.
1714000	1716000	I can kind of treat it a little more like a movie.
1716000	1718000	But I'm hearing really good things about it.
1718000	1719000	Yeah, it looks good.
1719000	1720000	Yeah, so I'm excited about that.
1720000	1722000	Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?
1722000	1724000	I didn't play a whole ton this week.
1724000	1730000	I did end up playing a little bit of Playstation VR yesterday because we had some friends over and I was showing them that.
1730000	1737000	And then I decided to get into the game, so I did play a little bit of Until Dawn Rush of Blood, which I still love that game.
1737000	1745000	It would be fun to speedrun that, but I don't think you can because it's on rails and there's minimal things you can speed up in that.
1745000	1752000	I mainly just played mobile games, so still playing the Office Space one.
1752000	1755000	I played very little of Pokemon Go.
1755000	1760000	I know they have different things going on, but I don't know.
1760000	1763000	It's not up to really kind of get me playing the game a lot.
1763000	1765000	Although, I keep running into inventory problems now.
1765000	1771000	I've accumulated so many Pokeballs that I'm like, geez, I've got to start catching things because I have like 175 Pokeballs.
1771000	1777000	I've got to start throwing them away just to be able to keep getting my daily spins on stuff.
1777000	1779000	So, I don't know.
1779000	1780000	That's pretty much it.
1780000	1786000	I've been trying to work on the Game Jam stuff.
1786000	1794000	I've been falling asleep while working on the Game Jam stuff, so not much has been getting accomplished there.
1794000	1799000	But I'm trying. No promises. That's it.
1799000	1803000	Okay. I have to admit, I haven't really been playing a lot this week.
1803000	1808000	On a personal note, my mom went back in the hospital on the 4th of July.
1808000	1812000	That's the thing that happened that kind of ruined the holiday.
1812000	1817000	And she's been asleep since then after having a couple surgeries.
1817000	1825000	The doctors say she's going to be fine and she's on a path to getting better.
1825000	1829000	But obviously, it takes an emotional toll. I'm sure you all can understand.
1829000	1833000	So anyway, not to be too much of a downer, but that's the reality.
1833000	1837000	Why I haven't been streaming a lot this week and why I haven't been playing a lot this week.
1837000	1839000	Real life happens sometimes.
1839000	1845000	But when I have been playing games, I've been playing a bit of Pokemon Go with Alan.
1845000	1848000	Just because Alan's kind of into it, I'm into it.
1848000	1850000	The new rating thing is actually really rad.
1850000	1855000	I'm liking it more and more because we actually do it.
1855000	1859000	It's not impossible for Alan and I to go take out a gym together.
1860000	1867000	Our little strategy that we do now, we go out at like 11 o'clock, 11.30 and take gyms.
1867000	1870000	So that way they stay up overnight and we get our 50 coins.
1870000	1875000	We don't take a lot. We'll take like 2 or 3 to make sure one of them stays up overnight and we get our 50 coins.
1875000	1877000	And that's kind of like what we do now.
1877000	1883000	So that's like a fun thing to do and still catching what we can and all that stuff.
1883000	1891000	But I would say if I have been gaming, it's been like all Final Fantasy XIV and the Stormblood expansion which I'm still making my way through.
1891000	1898000	And apparently I only have like 2 or 3 quests left before I'm done with the expansion.
1898000	1907000	And the story has definitely been ramping up and it's like everything is leading up to the big final conflict and Final Fantasy style.
1907000	1909000	So excited to finally finish that.
1909000	1916000	And I got to say, I think I preferred the Heavensward story better.
1916000	1918000	But Stormblood is great. Don't get me wrong. Stormblood is great.
1918000	1924000	But I think there's some great characters in Stormblood that are really, really like...
1924000	1927000	You're really interested in a lot of these characters.
1927000	1931000	And the bad people are like really, really bad and well done bad.
1931000	1934000	And the good people are also really, really well done.
1934000	1940000	So I think you can almost get into the characters in a way that I only felt a big connection with just a couple in Heavensward.
1940000	1944000	Even though I felt the story was better in Heavensward.
1944000	1947000	So yeah, been playing a lot of Final Fantasy XIV.
1947000	1949000	But other than that, that's pretty much my gaming.
1949000	1953000	But I am looking forward to Final Fantasy XII next week.
1953000	1955000	I will definitely be picking that up on Tuesday.
1955000	1958000	Now, I saw just briefly something. I don't think it's in our show role.
1958000	1963000	It was someone was complaining about how there's a housing shortage in Final Fantasy XIV.
1963000	1972000	Oh yeah. So on one of the servers, some guys bought up like all the houses in one of the wards.
1972000	1977000	So there's like a limited number of player housing that you can have on the servers in Final Fantasy XIV.
1977000	1979000	I guess it boils down to storage space.
1979000	1984000	So on one of the servers, which isn't even the one I play on. It's one of the lesser populated servers.
1984000	1986000	Somebody bought all the housing on there.
1986000	1988000	And I don't remember what the point was they were trying to make.
1988000	1990000	But there was some point they were trying to make with it.
1990000	1996000	And it's just, it's interesting because the space for housing is limited in that game.
1996000	2003000	And I've already seen it cause things where people buy plots and then flip them, try to sell them for twice as much.
2003000	2007000	Like scalping, basically virtual scalping of these limited plots.
2007000	2011000	And I understand there's like storage and server issues.
2011000	2016000	But I really wish the team would find a way to really like dramatically increase the size of the housing.
2016000	2020000	Though to their credit, I mean they have expanded it several times.
2020000	2024000	Like they are trying to address it and expanding it in different ways that they do.
2024000	2027000	Why can't they just let them only own one house?
2027000	2035000	Well because what they're doing is they're rolling new characters, sending the money to the other characters and then buying them on the other characters.
2035000	2039000	So even if they are limited to just one, they're just not allowed to send money.
2039000	2041000	It should be one per account. It should be limited.
2041000	2044000	And I know there should be other stuff in place.
2045000	2051000	Well the interesting thing about that is that it will probably get back to the development team on Final Fantasy XIV with all the press coverage that's been getting.
2051000	2053000	And they'll do something to address it.
2053000	2058000	But they have, so right now in the game there's three housing areas.
2058000	2064000	And they're about to open a fourth because of this expansion there's now a new housing area for Kugane.
2064000	2069000	Which is the new big city that is going to have a whole ton of new plots to go with it.
2069000	2072000	So I assume that will help address the issue.
2072000	2077000	And they also at one point did what's called apartments which don't have a limit on them.
2077000	2086000	You can have a personal apartment for a set amount of money and as many players as wants to can have those.
2086000	2089000	So they're trying to address it in weird ways.
2089000	2095000	But sometimes the way they design things in that game kind of boxes them in.
2095000	2099000	And I feel like a ton of it dates back to 1.0.
2099000	2104000	And I realize there was no player housing in 1.0 but it's something about those servers and all that stuff.
2104000	2108000	I feel like they got boxed in somehow and they still are trying to.
2108000	2113000	I mean the whole class and job system they're still boxed in from 1.0.
2113000	2119000	And every expansion so far they've done something to kind of further separate themselves from that.
2119000	2122000	They eliminated cross classing in this recent expansion.
2122000	2124000	They just eliminated the cross classing.
2124000	2129000	You no longer have to level Thaumaturge which is just Black Mage.
2129000	2132000	Thaumaturge and Archer in order to get Black Mage.
2132000	2133000	You don't have to do that anymore.
2133000	2142000	So they did something new instead called role actions where you have a pool of 10 actions and you can pick 5 of them for your class.
2142000	2147000	And it's very similar to the cross classing but you don't actually have to level anything besides the class you want to play.
2147000	2149000	So it's kind of interesting in that way.
2150000	2156000	So let's see. Vidpower in chat says, what does housing do for players in Final Fantasy XIV?
2156000	2167000	Not a lot. Most of it is visual. However, there's the airship stuff that you can send out on the exploratory voyages.
2167000	2170000	And I think you can only do that with a house.
2170000	2174000	You might be able to do it with apartments though. I don't remember.
2174000	2178000	See my free company has a house so I don't have to worry about any of this stuff.
2179000	2182000	I think it makes sense you could probably do it from apartments too.
2182000	2185000	Because it would seem weird that they would lock people out of that completely.
2188000	2190000	That's been my game of the week. Lots of Final Fantasy XIV.
2190000	2193000	Although Stormblood's been great and it's been many hours.
2193000	2198000	Now that all the launch issues are fixed, Stormblood's great.
2200000	2206000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio with VoGnetwork.com, use the passphrase, earthquake.
2207000	2212000	Okay, let's get into some gaming news, shall we? Lots of other stuff going on around the gaming community this week.
2212000	2214000	We'll start off with Loki.
2214000	2216000	Yeah, so this is kind of neat.
2216000	2227000	I guess I understand why they may have held off on it, but now they're allowing you on the Xbox Live game store.
2227000	2236000	You can actually purchase, or you're going to be able to make purchases soon and actually gift those digital purchases to friends.
2236000	2240000	So right now I know one that pretty much Steam does it.
2240000	2246000	I don't think PlayStation Network or even Nintendo's or even Microsoft's currently allows it.
2246000	2251000	But it is going to be something that's going to be added pretty soon here.
2252000	2264000	Which is good. I'm glad that they're going to have more options available if you want to gift someone something for their birthday or whatever.
2264000	2271000	The other thing that they're talking about adding that's not really confirmed yet is deleting achievement-less games.
2271000	2277000	But they haven't really added that. It was on the 360, but they never added it to the Xbox One.
2277000	2278000	So that's kind of nice.
2278000	2284000	I wish I could do that with my library on the PlayStation Network where I could delete games I don't want on there.
2284000	2288000	I have demos for shit, like a demo for Black Ops or something like that.
2288000	2293000	I thought the trophy list stuff was on play. Oh, you mean you want it out of your library?
2293000	2297000	Out of my library. I don't want it to display more. I don't need to have a demo for Lego Batman 3 anymore.
2297000	2299000	Or the Destiny Alpha.
2300000	2302000	I don't need that in there.
2302000	2309000	Yeah, a bunch of that stuff. I wish I could just say, please leave my library or something like that.
2309000	2311000	Or don't display it anymore.
2311000	2313000	Or move to bottom or something.
2313000	2315000	Yeah, remove from the active list.
2315000	2320000	Or separate it to a demo thing that only appears in demos or something like that.
2320000	2322000	I wish I could do that.
2322000	2327000	Well, the gifting thing, it's one of those things where it's kind of weird that it's not already there.
2327000	2334000	It's probably a good thing, though, because remember with all the problems that they had with the whole digital people stealing accounts and stuff like that.
2334000	2336000	Oh, yeah, yeah.
2336000	2338000	Maybe it's a good thing that that's not a thing right now.
2338000	2340000	Didn't exist then, yeah.
2340000	2348000	But even still, people were still buying really expensive loot packs, which I think that's maybe even worse because they can buy multiples of those.
2348000	2355000	But I don't know. It is something, though, that I think is a feature that they should have.
2356000	2361000	Yeah, I mean, I think we've all gifted each other stuff on Steam before.
2361000	2364000	You just bought me genital jousting for my birthday.
2364000	2368000	Nothing says happy birthday like genital jousting, that's for sure.
2368000	2377000	But yeah, it would just make sense that you could have a wish list on Microsoft, Xbox.
2377000	2391000	Well, also, I mean, since it is becoming one ecosystem with the PC, I mean, in a way, you could gift like Forza Horizon 3 and that would be on your Xbox and PC, right?
2391000	2398000	For those, I mean, I think it's still limited what games do that, but that's still a cool option that you can gift it to somebody and they get it on both.
2398000	2405000	So I'm kind of surprised now a feature like that doesn't exist on PlayStation or Switch even.
2405000	2416000	Well, PlayStation I'm not too surprised with because there's a lot of features that people want that they're just not going to put out because the system's just not capable of doing that, you know, like emulating a PSP or PlayStation 1.
2416000	2424000	Those advanced PlayStation 1 graphics, you know, the PSP could do the PlayStation 1, but you see, the PlayStation 4 just can't do the PlayStation 1.
2424000	2427000	So therefore, the PSP is definitely the more overpowered system.
2427000	2428000	Right.
2428000	2430000	Just bet you didn't know that, you know.
2430000	2432000	There's so much power in that thing you never realized.
2432000	2433000	Exactly.
2434000	2441000	It would be great if they would just release a little UMD reader that you could hook up to via USB to the PlayStation 4, but I just somehow don't think that's going to happen.
2441000	2442000	It's just not on their list.
2442000	2446000	We don't need to go with UMDs. That was kind of dumb, but.
2446000	2451000	I still, do you know I still see UMDs for sale at like Fry's and stuff, but I think I was at Dimple the other day.
2451000	2459000	That was going to be the next big thing, remember? They were going to have all these movies and stuff that you could play on your PSP and it was a neat idea.
2459000	2461000	And then they came up with Blu-ray, so.
2461000	2464000	And then they released the Vita, and then they're like, what's a Vita?
2465000	2466000	And then that was that.
2467000	2471000	Alright. Moving on, let's talk about Overwatch a little bit.
2471000	2475000	I did play a little Overwatch on the Public Test Realm, and it was because of this.
2475000	2486000	Doomfist finally making his way into Overwatch. They've been teasing Doomfist ever since the very original trailer for the game.
2486000	2490000	Because the two kids, if you remember the very first, like it looked like a fucking Pixar short.
2490000	2497000	The trailer for the game, the two kids are looking at, oh Doomfist, little fist of Doom or whatever it was, his actual Doomfist.
2497000	2503000	They were actually looking at that, so now Doomfist is a character that's in the game, so that's really awesome.
2503000	2507000	And he has some moves where, and I was, I actually tried playing with him a little bit.
2507000	2512000	So he can kind of shoot rockets out of his glove, but it's not super effective.
2512000	2516000	What he's really effective at doing is like charging at people, is kind of what he does.
2516000	2520000	And he can kind of do like a Shoryuken type of move, where he like uppercuts them into the air.
2520000	2525000	So it is really satisfactory to like rush somebody on the back line, like Ana or something, and then uppercut her.
2525000	2527000	So he's just Falcon punching everybody?
2527000	2536000	Yeah, actually, yeah. So, I mean, Doomfist is, he also can actually punch a, actually the Captain Falcon comparison is not completely like, wrong.
2536000	2539000	And there's something really rewarding about all of that.
2539000	2553000	So like, I would play, like, I don't think Doomfist will be a main for me in Overwatch, but I won't be, like, when I get Tracer or Reaper in Random Heroes, I sigh.
2553000	2556000	Because I'm terrible with those two characters, especially Tracer.
2556000	2562000	Like, I love Tracer as a character, but trying to play her, I can't do it. I'm terrible with her.
2562000	2566000	So, but Doomfist, I would be happy to get. Like, Doomfist was a lot of fun to play.
2566000	2571000	But of course, on the test room right now, everybody's fucking playing Doomfist. Everybody's playing Doomfist.
2571000	2574000	But, I mean, that's to be expected. Of course, that's what's to be expected.
2574000	2583000	Now, here's the other thing about Doomfist that I suppose is a little bit controversial, but I think it's very silly.
2583000	2588000	So Terry Crews is not going to be voicing Doomfist.
2588000	2595000	And, you know, there was, like, I think Terry Crews had tweeted something about that he wanted to be Doomfist.
2595000	2600000	So a lot of, like, the Blizzard fan community started, like, going crazy, like,
2600000	2604000	Yeah, Terry Crews should do it. Terry Crews is awesome. He's a gamer like us.
2604000	2609000	Well, they didn't go with Terry Crews. They went with an actor, and I'm so sorry if I mispronounce this.
2609000	2615000	I think it's Seher Ngaouja. I think it's how you pronounce that. Sorry if I mispronounced that.
2615000	2622000	That is the voice actor that they went with. But when I see tweets about the voice actor they did go with,
2622000	2627000	I'm seeing all these responses that are like, Blizzard sucks. They should have went with Terry Crews.
2627000	2633000	Like, it should have been Terry Crews. And I can't help but think, like, that's really fucking disrespectful to the voice actor that did get it.
2633000	2641000	A, Doomfist's voice is fine. Like, he sounds fine in the game. In fact, he's better than fine. He's good.
2641000	2648000	He's a good voice actor and a good character. And, you know, I think Terry Crews is fucking awesome too, don't get me wrong.
2648000	2652000	But, he is a little- He doesn't need to voice everything. He doesn't need to voice everything.
2652000	2658000	And he does have a certain, like, I would say, like, it's kind of like a, like, loud over the top.
2658000	2662000	Maybe this is Crackdown 3 influencing that a little bit. And that's the point I'm about to get to, is that-
2662000	2668000	I think it's Old Spice. He's still gonna get a nice fucking paycheck from Crackdown 3.
2668000	2675000	Terry Crews, like, is Crackdown 3 right now after E3. And that's a great, like, marriage.
2675000	2682000	And you know what? Microsoft probably saw a lot of those tweets about Terry Crews doing Doomfist and they probably called him.
2682000	2687000	So the community did make something- I would bet the community did make that happen for Terry Crews in a way.
2687000	2697000	I mean, his talents did that too. But my point is, is that, like, don't disrespect this other voice actor because maybe they were looking for somebody that just could deliver a different voice that wasn't-
2697000	2707000	Because Doomfist, I mean, he's not subdued, but he's not like, oh, yeah, like, over the top, like, whoa, you know, he's not like that at all.
2707000	2713000	Like, so I think maybe this voice actor they went with is just giving the performance that they wanted.
2713000	2724000	So I just- I just- I just think it's really shitty when I see those tweets, like, with this other voice actor mentioned and tagged in them going, should have been Terry Crews.
2725000	2734000	You know what? The business- the business is- sucks sometimes, but at the same time, I will get props to Terry Crews and I'm not blaming him at all for this.
2734000	2741000	I think Terry Crews is handling it like a professional because he wrote a very nice tweet and he said, Doomfist came out awesome.
2741000	2749000	It was everything I'd hoped for, like, I'm paraphrasing the tweet, but he wrote a very nice tweet that was like, hey, Doomfist rules, even though I'm not voicing it.
2749000	2757000	So, you know, he didn't, you know, you know what I mean? Like, he wrote a very nice tweet, which is exactly what a professional does and so that was cool.
2757000	2766000	So I don't blame Terry Crews at all for any of this fuckery I see on Twitter when people start replying about like, you know, fuck Blizzard, it should have been Terry Crews.
2766000	2773000	Like, you know what? Sometimes the vision just lined up a different way. You know, give this other guy a chance, give Doomfist a chance.
2773000	2778000	He's an awful lot of fun to play and yes, the voice work is great as well. So there you go.
2780000	2789000	Let's see. Also, what is a chat over at live.fognetwork.com. Oh, great question from Bobby Blackwolf.
2789000	2796000	Is Terry Crews SAG-AFTRA and could it be, and I'm inferring from that, could it be related to the whole strike thing?
2796000	2799000	I doubt it because he's doing voicing for Microsoft.
2799000	2804000	Yeah, and the actor they did pick is a screen actor who has on-screen roles.
2804000	2810000	So this other actor they went with has to be a card member of SAG, has to be.
2810000	2817000	So I don't think, well, and for all we know, I mean, the voice work actually could have been done a long time ago.
2817000	2821000	Because again, we knew about Doomfist when they first announced the game.
2821000	2827000	So it's entirely possible that the voice acting was done a long time ago before the strike happened.
2827000	2829000	But it's a good thought there.
2832000	2838000	Let's see. Oh, interesting. Over in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Tigerclaw says,
2838000	2844000	I think it's more like Terry Crews wanted to be in the game more than them asking him if he wants to be in it.
2844000	2850000	But I don't fault Terry Crews for that. I would love to be a voice actor in a video game.
2850000	2855000	I think that would be fucking awesome. Wouldn't that be fun to voice a character in a video game someday?
2855000	2862000	I think that would be great. But I also understand I'm not a professional and they're probably going to hire professionals.
2862000	2865000	And I'm OK with that. I got my podcast. It's cool.
2865000	2870000	So, you know, if there's a little indie game someday that maybe I can do a voice over in. Cool.
2870000	2874000	But, you know, I'm not a professional. We'll leave it to them.
2874000	2880000	So let's see. CrazyChocobonator in chat says,
2880000	2886000	to be honest, Doomfist doesn't sound like a video game character's name, more like an extreme version of fisting.
2886000	2889000	Yes. Yes. There's there's been plenty of those jokes over on Twitter.
2889000	2892000	It sounds like an Invader Zim character.
2892000	2896000	SSJ100Matt with a good comparison here. Growing up,
2896000	2901000	I always wanted Kurt Russell to be Wolverine in a live action X-Men movie.
2901000	2906000	After seeing Hugh Jackman do it. Well, he did a far better job than Russell could have done.
2907000	2911000	Oh, you know, the classic example of that in Hollywood classic.
2911000	2915000	Do you remember when they announced Heath Ledger is going to play the Joker?
2915000	2919000	Yes. And you remember how everybody was like, what the fuck?
2919000	2922000	And that wasn't the first time it happened with Batman either. You go further back.
2922000	2926000	Michael Keaton. When they announced Michael Keaton was going to play Batman, everybody.
2926000	2929000	The comedian? The comedian? Beetlejuice?
2929000	2933000	It's going to be bad. What the fuck? Like the Internet wasn't really around back then.
2933000	2936000	But you better believe there was still like campaign,
2936000	2941000	like whatever Twitter was back then in the form of postcards and stuff.
2941000	2944000	Was that when Michael Keaton got to play Mr. Freeze?
2944000	2949000	It was. No, it was AOL chat rooms and BBS's.
2949000	2955000	I don't even. BBS's, yes. But the original Batman was like 1989.
2955000	2958000	I don't even think AOL was really. Maybe Quantum Link.
2958000	2962000	Yeah, that would have been BBS's then. Yeah, BBS's.
2962000	2968000	So, yeah. So, I mean, that is. I mean, if you want to kind of compare this to movies,
2968000	2971000	you know, when they announced that Heath Ledger got the part of the Joker,
2971000	2974000	I'm sure everybody was like Jack Nicholson five ever.
2974000	2977000	Like there's nobody's ever going to be better than Jack Nicholson and all this stuff.
2977000	2984000	And it's like, you know, they were different interpretations of the role.
2984000	2991000	Like Jack Nicholson. Nothing about Heath Ledger's amazing, mind blowing fucking performance as Joker.
2991000	2996000	Nothing about that diminished the also amazing job that Jack Nicholson did.
2996000	3001000	The only thing that tarnished the role of the Joker was Jared Leto.
3001000	3004000	Sorry, cheap shot. I could help myself. Sorry. Cheap shot. Cheap shot.
3004000	3009000	To be honest, I don't even blame Jared Leto because I thought he looked kind of cool as the Joker.
3009000	3014000	I think just the script sucked. So, I mean, I'm not even going to blame Jared Leto for that.
3014000	3018000	I'm just saying that script was just fucking terrible.
3018000	3024000	So anyway, we're getting a little off track. But my point is, I think after that point,
3024000	3029000	after Christopher Nolan cast Heath Ledger as the Joker and everybody was like,
3029000	3032000	what the fuck, buddy? And then everybody saw that movie.
3032000	3037000	After that, it was kind of like, okay, Christopher Nolan can do whatever the fuck he wants.
3037000	3042000	Like clearly the man knows what he's doing. So when they announced Anne Hathaway as Catwoman,
3042000	3047000	I have to admit there was a part of me that was like, I'm not sure that's what I would have done.
3047000	3053000	But you know what? I would have said the same thing about Heath Ledger.
3053000	3059000	So I'm going to, and sure enough Anne Hathaway was a, for that version of the Catwoman,
3059000	3064000	for what Nolan was doing in that movie, she was fine. She was better than fine. She was great.
3064000	3069000	Michelle Pfeiffer will kind of always be Catwoman to me in that role.
3069000	3075000	But even then, you go back to like Eartha Kitt and like the campy 60's stuff.
3075000	3076000	Julie Newmar.
3076000	3080000	Julie Newmar, Eartha Kitt, like the classic 60's Batman actresses.
3080000	3084000	Like they also owned it in their own way. It was just all different. So anyway.
3084000	3086000	I'm sure Halle Berry owned it in her own way.
3090000	3094000	Look, Halle Berry is a great example that even great actresses can make mistakes.
3094000	3097000	So you know what? It's all right. Anyway, we're getting off track.
3097000	3102000	It is a video game show, but I'm bringing all that up as comparisons that it's like, you know what?
3102000	3106000	They cast somebody else's Doomfist and he's doing great.
3106000	3111000	So this Terry Crews stuff, even Terry Crews says he loves Doomfist.
3111000	3115000	So the rest of you need to stop with the bullshit on Twitter and let the guys who are,
3115000	3120000	gals who are creating Overwatch create the game they want to make. Done.
3120000	3124000	So Terry Crews, he's still going to be a part of the gaming community.
3124000	3128000	He's just over there on Crackdown 3, which I bet most of you are going to be buying anyway.
3128000	3133000	So I think everybody's winning in this scenario. I really do.
3133000	3140000	All right. Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
3140000	3145000	JD calling me out on the EarthaKit thing, but I said that before I looked in chat.
3145000	3149000	It was just very different. But here's the other thing to consider.
3149000	3155000	I was like 13 or 14 years old when Batman Returns came out.
3155000	3160000	And in a way, so, okay, I'm going to go, I'm really tangent training tonight,
3160000	3162000	but it's a slow news week, okay?
3162000	3167000	So Bobby brought up his old comparison about Final Fantasy on his show earlier, right?
3167000	3172000	And he said, you know, it seems to be that the favorite Final Fantasy game of people
3172000	3176000	is the Final Fantasy game that came out when you were around 13 years old, right?
3176000	3178000	That tends to be your favorite Final Fantasy game.
3178000	3180000	And for me, that's true. It really is.
3180000	3184000	Like Final Fantasy 2 and 3 on the Super Nintendo, which of course were 4 and 6.
3184000	3188000	Those are kind of like a tie for my favorite. So I get that.
3188000	3192000	I would say your favorite Batman movie might be the same sort of thing.
3192000	3197000	And Batman Returns was that movie that came out right when I was around 13 or 14.
3197000	3202000	And I kind of think to this day that movie is grossly underrated in the Batman franchise.
3202000	3203000	That movie is fucking amazing.
3203000	3208000	And Michelle Pfeiffer just, you know, like to a little gay boy at 13 years old,
3208000	3211000	like Michelle Pfeiffer was just everything and then some.
3211000	3215000	So you know what? Dark Soccer, you loved her too, right? Please, please tell me.
3215000	3216000	Meow.
3216000	3217000	Yes.
3217000	3219000	When she did all the flips and she's like, meow.
3219000	3224000	One thing that I thought was awesome though is that the first whip scene in the department store,
3224000	3225000	she did it in one take.
3225000	3226000	Yeah.
3226000	3229000	I was like, that made me want to whip.
3229000	3230000	Right?
3230000	3233000	I just wanted to take the heads off of men who opposed me.
3233000	3237000	And I'm sorry, did I say that out loud? I meant mannequins. Mannequins.
3237000	3238000	Representing.
3238000	3243000	Presenting the patriarchy, which I will dismantle with my whip.
3243000	3247000	And chat says, I think Halle Berry is a good sport over it.
3247000	3249000	I think she accepted her Razzie for Catwoman.
3249000	3251000	Yeah, I hear she was a good sport about it.
3251000	3256000	She knows it's a shit movie and she just, if you can't laugh at yourself, what can you laugh at?
3256000	3258000	You know what though? To be fair to Halle Berry,
3258000	3264000	if Ryan Reynolds can be both the terrible Green Lantern and the fucking awesome Deadpool,
3264000	3265000	you got a chance to stay.
3265000	3267000	And the terrible Deadpool.
3267000	3268000	But not his fault.
3268000	3270000	He was also the terrible Deadpool.
3270000	3271000	He was also the terrible Deadpool.
3271000	3273000	That is true, he was the terrible Deadpool.
3273000	3274000	That was Dev's.
3274000	3277000	But he was the best part before they made him the terrible Deadpool.
3277000	3279000	Yes, correct.
3279000	3281000	Yes, I forgot about that.
3281000	3283000	Who knew it was going to turn into movie chat on OLR tonight?
3283000	3285000	But you know what? Tangents, they happen.
3285000	3286000	You know, it's inevitable.
3286000	3288000	Games, movies, they go hand in hand.
3288000	3292000	Alright, Dark Sakura, you got some good news for us this week, right?
3293000	3297000	Well, we did bring up the summer games done quick a little bit earlier.
3297000	3301000	And I watched bits and pieces of it here and there, certain runs.
3301000	3303000	The whole thing was pretty amazing.
3303000	3307000	They beat last year's goal by a significant amount.
3307000	3309000	Or not last year's goal, but last year's total.
3309000	3313000	Last year, they pulled in $1,294,139.
3313000	3319000	This year, $1,760,415.
3319000	3320000	Nice.
3320000	3325000	So by topping it by almost $500,000 is pretty amazing.
3325000	3328000	That's some great incentives, too.
3328000	3333000	I'm sad that I missed the solo co-op Portal 2 run.
3333000	3336000	But at least you can go back and catch all of those.
3336000	3338000	Yeah, I missed most of that stuff live.
3338000	3341000	But thankfully, they're really quick to put that stuff up onto YouTube.
3341000	3342000	So, yeah.
3342000	3345000	Especially, you know, I tried watching.
3345000	3346000	I was like, ooh, Final Fantasy VII run.
3346000	3347000	Eight hours long.
3347000	3349000	Nope, not watching this whole thing.
3349000	3355000	Some of the crowd interaction was, for me, not just, you know, the commentary couch,
3355000	3358000	but the way the crowd interacted with it.
3358000	3362000	Like, they were singing along with the Disney songs in Kingdom Hearts 2.
3362000	3370000	And, like, when the guy was doing Pungoland, which is just, like, a really...
3370000	3374000	It was kind of based on Kaizo Mario, but not bad.
3374000	3377000	Every time the guy would die, they'd hold up a sign and they'd go,
3377000	3380000	16, you know, for every number that he died.
3380000	3385000	And I watched the Mega Man X6 and the X2 run.
3385000	3389000	And it was just amazing watching how good people get with these games
3389000	3391000	and watching some of the clipping tricks.
3391000	3395000	And the thing that I like about it is that they have people...
3395000	3399000	Some of the people doing the commentary are also speedrunners of that game.
3399000	3400000	Yeah, yeah.
3400000	3402000	And I'm glad that I watched the Super Metroid run.
3402000	3404000	Did you hear about the big upset?
3404000	3407000	You were texting me, and I think I saw that, like,
3407000	3409000	two of them got knocked out right at the beginning, right?
3409000	3411000	Right with the first big boss.
3411000	3412000	That, wow.
3412000	3414000	Both of them died.
3414000	3415000	You know what, though?
3415000	3417000	Props to them for getting up on stage and doing it.
3417000	3418000	It's a lot of pressure.
3418000	3420000	It's a lot of pressure, you know?
3420000	3422000	And sometimes you're gonna make mistakes.
3422000	3424000	So I hope those guys aren't feeling too bad.
3424000	3427000	But, at any rate, though, so they finally just focused on the last guy
3427000	3433000	who I don't think had ever done anything for the event before.
3433000	3439000	He's, like, a fairly new speedrunner, and he finished Super Metroid, like, perfectly.
3439000	3446000	And this is, I think, the first year that, without any extra help from the sponsor or anything,
3446000	3448000	that they got more for Kill the Animals.
3448000	3452000	You know, one of our old-school listeners...
3452000	3456000	I know he doesn't listen anymore, but he's a big part of that speed event.
3456000	3459000	Kevin DDR does the Tetris stuff.
3459000	3462000	I hear he did very well on that block.
3462000	3464000	Oh, yeah. We was watching it. It was pretty crazy.
3464000	3468000	Yeah. No, I know. We do have listeners from, you know, years ago
3468000	3471000	that go on to bigger and better things that are even bigger than this show.
3471000	3473000	But it's awesome. I love that.
3473000	3475000	I love that when, like, I see people, it's like,
3475000	3477000	oh, I knew that person when they were listening to OLR.
3477000	3480000	That was, like, really stupidly fast, too.
3480000	3481000	I had to watch part of that.
3481000	3482000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3482000	3489000	But, overall, the great thing about this is it's going to a really good cause.
3490000	3493000	I'm not going to do it in French. It's the Doctors Without Borders.
3493000	3494000	Yeah.
3495000	3501000	And I think that we need to have more charities along those lines
3501000	3504000	get attention because they provide the treatment
3504000	3510000	no matter any, you know, walk that the person comes from who needs it.
3510000	3511000	Right.
3511000	3515000	And they even go into places where there is some pretty nasty stuff going on,
3515000	3519000	like war zones and things like that and provide necessary help.
3519000	3523000	They were a huge part of, like, when that Ebola crisis was going on
3523000	3524000	not that long ago.
3524000	3525000	Totally, totally.
3525000	3527000	You know, they were a huge part of help and make sure that didn't get worse.
3527000	3530000	But the other thing, too, is that it's nice to see something that,
3530000	3535000	for us, was, you know, kind of, you know, just hobby and leisure and fun
3535000	3539000	that, you know, has turned into something so wonderful.
3539000	3541000	And the next one's going to be, of course, in January.
3541000	3543000	With awesome games done quick.
3543000	3547000	Which is technically the flagship run, but, I mean, they're both kind of...
3547000	3549000	Some of those prizes that were pretty nuts.
3549000	3552000	Let me ask this. What do you think contributes to, I mean,
3552000	3556000	because half a million more, that's quite a bit more money.
3556000	3559000	Do you think that's just maybe as simple as it's the logistics
3559000	3562000	of where the 4th of July fell this year, that you had a lot more people
3562000	3564000	along weekends that could sit at home and watch it?
3564000	3569000	Or do you think maybe this speed running stuff in this particular marathon
3569000	3571000	is getting more and more visibility?
3571000	3573000	I mean, we saw during awesome games done quick,
3573000	3575000	one of the guys went on Colbert, right?
3575000	3576000	Yeah.
3576000	3578000	Yeah, so do you think just in general this whole scene
3578000	3580000	is getting more and more visibility in this particular marathon?
3580000	3582000	I think it's a combination of both of those factors,
3582000	3584000	but I truly do believe that it's the visibility.
3584000	3588000	I mean, and one thing that, you know, I think that the people
3588000	3591000	who scoffed at, you know, gaming in the 80s
3591000	3594000	don't seem to realize is that we all grew up.
3594000	3596000	Well, yeah, yeah, I think that's what it is.
3596000	3600000	Those of us that were playing games in the 80s, we're now the adults.
3600000	3601000	So it's...
3601000	3602000	Exactly.
3602000	3603000	Yeah, it's time to change.
3603000	3606000	And gaming culture is even more prevalent.
3606000	3609000	I mean, a lot of these systems are a lot easier to come by.
3609000	3612000	If not, you know, the current gen, there's the older ones that you can get.
3612000	3616000	And then classic gaming itself has become a lot more prevalent.
3616000	3619000	You have people, you know, some of these people who were doing
3619000	3622000	some of the speed runs on some of the classic games
3622000	3626000	were probably born the year that game came out.
3626000	3627000	Yeah.
3627000	3631000	You know, and to see them enduring like this, I mean,
3631000	3634000	it does my ancient heart good.
3634000	3637000	You know, I have to admit, and maybe I'm probably going to get a little shit
3637000	3639000	for this comment, but I have to just be honest with you all for a minute.
3639000	3642000	Like, I'm getting to that point now where some of these conventions
3642000	3645000	that I've gone to, I kind of start to look around
3645000	3648000	and I kind of go, I'm the old guy here.
3648000	3650000	Am I getting too old for these conventions?
3650000	3651000	Never.
3651000	3653000	I know, I know, but I can't help it.
3653000	3655000	There's certain conventions I've gone to where I kind of go,
3655000	3658000	like, I could be everybody's dad.
3658000	3660000	It's a weird feeling.
3660000	3662000	But I always say the one convention I don't feel that with at all
3662000	3665000	is Dragon Con, because I feel like Dragon Con kind of like,
3665000	3667000	I think because it's been around so fucking long,
3667000	3670000	a lot of people in Atlanta that were going when they were 15
3670000	3672000	are still going now that they're 40.
3672000	3673000	So I think...
3673000	3675000	See, here's the problem.
3675000	3678000	If you're sitting there, you know, questioning, am I the old guy there,
3678000	3680000	that means you're not intoxicated enough.
3680000	3682000	So that's...
3682000	3684000	And I'm not trying to turn it into a pissing match
3684000	3687000	of who's the oldest here at VOG and OLR and all that stuff.
3687000	3692000	I'm just saying, in general, I'm starting to feel like
3692000	3694000	sometimes I'm the oldest person there and I'm like,
3694000	3695000	oh, this is a little weird.
3695000	3698000	Hey, I'm still going to cosplay as long as I can.
3698000	3700000	And I think at the end of the day, don't get me wrong,
3700000	3703000	I fucking get over it, I always do, you know,
3703000	3706000	because, you know, age ain't nothing but a number, baby.
3706000	3709000	But I'd be lying if I hadn't said sometimes I go to the cons
3709000	3712000	and I go, am I the oldest one here?
3714000	3715000	Let's see.
3716000	3718000	Yes, there it is, on time, the comments in chat,
3718000	3720000	shut the fuck up about getting old.
3721000	3725000	Tigerclaw in chat says, the majority of speedrunners are very young.
3725000	3729000	I would love to see someone in their 40s or 50s do a speedrun at the event.
3729000	3730000	Ha, ha, ha.
3730000	3735000	Well, cheap plug, Tigerclaw, but Flaco Jones here,
3735000	3737000	who's been on OLR many times before
3737000	3739000	and is part of the VoG Network family, really.
3739000	3741000	Flaco Jones is the same age as I am.
3741000	3743000	Like, we're only like a couple weeks apart with our birthdays
3743000	3745000	and he's been submitting that PT speedrun.
3745000	3750000	So I'm hoping he gets in just because it's a great speedrun
3750000	3753000	and I think there's a great story behind PT anyway
3753000	3757000	and the fact that, you know, somebody who's my age should be in there
3757000	3759000	doing the speedruns too, that'd be great.
3759000	3760000	Ha, ha, ha.
3760000	3764000	All right, all right, I'll stop with the topics
3764000	3767000	that are going to get me the shut the fuck up comments.
3767000	3769000	Let's move on with some other stories. Loki.
3769000	3772000	All right, so speaking of getting old,
3772000	3778000	these complaints sound like something that an older individual would have with a game,
3778000	3783000	but Ubisoft, much like, you know, other companies,
3783000	3785000	will do something special with their games.
3785000	3788000	They'll patch in like a cool holiday event
3788000	3792000	and so because of, you know, July 4th being Independence Day,
3792000	3797000	they patched in some fireworks that appear during the nighttime in the game.
3797000	3802000	So between June 29th and July 10th, there'd be fireworks going off at night,
3802000	3806000	which, you know, for most people it's like, eh, no big deal.
3807000	3810000	Except apparently a lot of people had problems with it.
3810000	3814000	They thought it was completely obnoxious, fucking annoying,
3814000	3816000	too frequent, too long, and too loud.
3816000	3818000	Apparently the fireworks were too loud
3818000	3821000	and it was annoying them during night missions.
3821000	3824000	So they would be like kind of sneaking around all of a sudden.
3824000	3826000	There's just a lot of booming going on in the background.
3826000	3830000	So, of course, you know, they heard about it, you know.
3830000	3835000	They said, you know, it's not possible to wrestle a fix for this,
3835000	3837000	so we made a tough choice just to remove them.
3837000	3841000	It says the heart says no, but the eardrums say yes.
3841000	3844000	I kind of want to see a video to see how loud they were.
3844000	3849000	Sadly, Watch Dogs 2 is one of those games I do need to go back and play
3849000	3853000	because I did enjoy it, but just haven't played it in a long time.
3853000	3856000	I would have been curious to see what the fireworks sounded like, though.
3856000	3858000	That's kind of funny, though.
3858000	3862000	Is it one of those things where maybe it was being developed in a studio
3862000	3865000	where they're using headphones or something, and on headphones it was okay,
3865000	3867000	but then when it was like on the TV it was like, oh, my God.
3867000	3870000	Maybe, I don't know, but like someone was saying that it is scaring their dog.
3870000	3873000	I mean, I get it, but like...
3873000	3875000	But how loud was your television?
3875000	3877000	It's like nitpicking, I think, it sounds like.
3877000	3878000	Just turn down the sound effects.
3878000	3885000	Like, okay, but I haven't played Watch Dogs 2,
3885000	3890000	but I'm assuming there's like gunshots and like other loud things that happen.
3890000	3892000	I would think that that would be louder, yes.
3892000	3894000	So that doesn't set off the dogs?
3894000	3897000	I mean, I don't know. I didn't see this fireworks thing,
3897000	3899000	so I don't know if people are being silly or not,
3899000	3904000	but it is a little weird to me that like if the gunshots and gunfights
3904000	3906000	that happen in these games don't set off the animals.
3906000	3909000	For one, if it is setting off the animals, you should probably turn your TV down
3909000	3913000	or think about headphones, because there's some great wireless headsets
3913000	3915000	for all the systems now that you can pick up.
3915000	3919000	So, I mean, just saying, just saying.
3919000	3923000	Yeah, so apparently, okay, so here's why it was like that,
3923000	3927000	because they're saying that apparently a company rep noted that
3927000	3930000	the people have spoken, we have carried out their will.
3930000	3934000	There was an annoying bug that snuck into our Independence Day event
3934000	3939000	that made the sound effects from the fireworks noticeable from everywhere on the map.
3939000	3943000	They have been turned off as to avoid further noise complaints.
3943000	3948000	It could be that, because I know like with developing some games and stuff,
3948000	3953000	that instead of having a positional audio, it's basically just like almost like a sound effect,
3953000	3957000	like a menu effect, and so basically you're hearing it the same volume
3957000	3960000	no matter how close you are to those fireworks.
3960000	3962000	So maybe that was the situation.
3962000	3967000	But, I mean, it seems like if that was the case, it'd be easy for them to fix, but whatever.
3968000	3970000	You people are just getting old.
3972000	3974000	If it's too loud, you're too old.
3974000	3977000	Okay, so I am gonna, I have to listen to hear what this sounds like real quick,
3977000	3980000	so I'm just gonna quickly just...
3980000	3981000	Can you, can you...
3981000	3984000	Okay, those are pretty fucking loud actually, now that I hear.
3984000	3986000	Can you copy-paste me the link real quick so we can play it over the air?
3986000	3987000	Huh?
3987000	3988000	Can you copy...
3988000	3989000	Yes, I can.
3989000	3991000	Can you copy-paste me the link so we can play it over the air real quick?
3991000	3994000	Yes, it is pretty loud actually, now that I see that, so...
3994000	3997000	Yeah, I want to have some frame of reference here, because maybe...
3997000	3998000	So let's...
3998000	4001000	Maybe I am being too harsh on the complainers.
4002000	4006000	So, alright, so Loki said this is what you get when it's live.
4006000	4011000	Sometimes there's unscripted moments that happen, including links to YouTube videos.
4011000	4015000	Okay, so I'm gonna look at this YouTube from Nate152.
4021000	4035000	I would think it is kind of loud, but I would think it's one of those things that would be like,
4035000	4039000	it's more annoying if that is going on the entire...
4039000	4041000	Because that's pretty frequent.
4041000	4046000	If that's going on the entire time you're trying to play the game, that would be kind of annoying.
4046000	4052000	If it was one of those things where that happens for like 30 seconds every 15 minutes or something,
4052000	4054000	then I think it would be a lot more tolerable.
4054000	4062000	Or, like what is being mentioned there, that you have to be in a certain area to hear it would be fine.
4062000	4066000	But I think it's not... I don't even know if it's so much the volume thing, because again,
4066000	4068000	I think the gunshots would probably be just as loud in that game,
4068000	4073000	but it's just the fact that it's constant and ongoing while you're trying to play this other game.
4073000	4075000	That part would be kind of annoying.
4076000	4078000	Alright, let's see.
4078000	4081000	Going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
4081000	4082000	Yeah, Bobby Blackwolf says,
4082000	4087000	It is going on the entire time, even inside buildings and in the water.
4087000	4088000	Yeah, that's a little ridiculous.
4088000	4092000	Yeah, and further on in the video, the guy's driving with his radio on,
4092000	4094000	and you can't hear anything over the fireworks.
4094000	4096000	It's just loud.
4096000	4101000	Alright, so maybe it is a little much, so fair enough, fair enough.
4101000	4104000	Alright, thank you for finding the video there so we could judge for ourselves.
4104000	4107000	Alright, let's move on to a story about emulation.
4107000	4110000	A couple stories here about Nintendo emulation,
4110000	4114000	including some people that have been peeking at the Nintendo Switch
4114000	4116000	and some of the internal parts of it.
4116000	4119000	Some of the modders who are working on the Switch right now,
4119000	4123000	because of course, hackers gonna hack, modders gonna mod, right?
4123000	4124000	We all know this.
4124000	4129000	Apparently, they have found there is an NES emulator embedded in the firmware,
4129000	4132000	and it's code named Flog.
4132000	4138000	I don't know why, but it is worth pointing out Flog is golf spelled backwards.
4138000	4142000	So maybe this emulator is gonna emulate NES golf.
4142000	4145000	I bet that's what it is, right? Anyway.
4145000	4147000	But that is the NES emulator.
4147000	4150000	It's apparently hiding already within the Switch.
4150000	4152000	So yeah, it's already embedded in the firmware.
4152000	4158000	But of course, you have to kind of trust modders that have been in the system looking at stuff.
4158000	4162000	There's no way to otherwise conclusively prove this.
4162000	4166000	But it wouldn't surprise me that they're building that out,
4166000	4173000	because we know that we will get Dr. Mario, Super Mario Bros. 3,
4173000	4179000	that will all be a part of this online thing when Nintendo Online officially rolls out.
4179000	4183000	Which is kind of, we're getting baby steps with everything that's happening with Splatoon 2,
4183000	4185000	which I know we haven't talked a lot about tonight,
4185000	4187000	but Splatoon 2 had a Direct this week,
4187000	4193000	and Splatoon 2, that's all gonna kick off with the first Splatfest next week,
4193000	4195000	and there's this whole online app that goes with it, right?
4195000	4199000	So we know the NES games are coming,
4199000	4204000	so it wouldn't surprise me that there's a NES emulator in there as well.
4206000	4208000	SSJ100Matt in chat says,
4208000	4210000	Modders were working on a Switch emulator day one.
4210000	4212000	Oh, of course, of course they were.
4212000	4214000	JD in chat says,
4214000	4218000	Maybe Nintendo will be a sponsor of Folsom Street Events.
4218000	4220000	Cause it's flogging, get it?
4220000	4222000	That's funny, I like that.
4222000	4225000	Anyhow, speaking of emulation,
4225000	4228000	of course everybody fucking wants an SNES mini.
4228000	4230000	Like everybody wants a fucking SNES mini,
4230000	4232000	and we all know Nintendo's not gonna make enough,
4232000	4235000	and I already went on my rant about scalpers last week,
4235000	4239000	or the week before maybe, so if you didn't hear it, go back and listen to it.
4239000	4246000	But, at least thank god some online retailers are trying to do some things about it.
4246000	4249000	Amazon UK being one of them.
4249000	4254000	Apparently they actually went so far as to contact customers to notify them
4254000	4258000	that if they preordered more than one SNES mini,
4258000	4263000	it was going to be changed to a max of one console per customer.
4263000	4268000	So anybody who ordered multiple consoles will now just receive one.
4268000	4270000	Yay! This is a start!
4270000	4274000	It's not perfect, cause certainly there's gonna be people that are like,
4274000	4277000	Oh, well now I'm gonna sign on to my spouse's account and my kid's account,
4277000	4279000	you know, so they'll get around it.
4279000	4287000	But, this is a good start, and should hopefully deter some of those room full of SNES minis and NES classics and all that stuff.
4287000	4294000	I believe eBay is doing something as well to try to combat this a little bit.
4294000	4301000	I think eBay's thing though, they are doing a, you can't actually put something on eBay
4301000	4304000	that is more than 90 days out of its official release.
4304000	4307000	That they should. I don't think preorders should be on eBay at all, to be honest.
4307000	4310000	Yeah, so they're scaling it back a bit.
4310000	4316000	Yeah, I'm with SSJ100, Matt, still waiting for Amazon to do US preorders.
4316000	4323000	Yeah, what about, I mean, I guess I'm okay if Amazon is taking the time to make sure the system doesn't
4323000	4327000	What if they don't do preorders in the US?
4327000	4332000	I don't see how Amazon doesn't do that. Oh, you mean just in general, Nintendo doesn't do any.
4332000	4334000	Because they're assholes.
4334000	4336000	We'll see.
4336000	4340000	Amazon could also be focusing on all that Prime Day stuff, they probably don't want
4340000	4341000	They've really been pushing that.
4341000	4342000	Yeah, they've really been pushing that.
4342000	4347000	It's only for their Prime users that you get the book that SNES.
4347000	4354000	I'd be okay with that. It would be kind of messed up, but I'm a Prime user, I'd be totally okay with that.
4354000	4361000	But I understand where that might not be the best business decision for Amazon.
4361000	4366000	Well, what if Amazon did this? What if they did two preorder waves?
4366000	4369000	And the first wave was Prime only and the second was whoever.
4369000	4372000	Would you feel that that was a dick move or no?
4372000	4375000	I would think Nintendo wouldn't be okay with that.
4375000	4383000	Because they're basically locking it behind something. It seems kind of silly.
4383000	4390000	In my opinion though, is it worse than when GameStop forces you to buy a bundle to get something?
4390000	4393000	Because I don't think so.
4394000	4396000	But, yeah, I understand that.
4396000	4406000	And that comes from more of there's no margin in anything, and so they have to make up their margin on that stuff by bundling in things that do have a margin for them.
4406000	4412000	They figure if there's going to be a shortage like that, that they want to make sure they're guaranteed to sell through on that stuff.
4412000	4422000	I think it's more akin to like, I'm going to charge you $20 to make a preorder on this item type of thing.
4422000	4425000	And that doesn't go towards the item cost.
4425000	4427000	Yeah, at the end of the day, I'm with SSG100Matt in chat.
4427000	4429000	Honestly though, I have money.
4429000	4431000	Nintendo, just take it.
4433000	4434000	I'm with you, buddy.
4434000	4436000	It's a tiny Linux machine that plays NES ROMs.
4436000	4437000	And I want it.
4437000	4439000	I mean, that's like, just...
4439000	4440000	And I want it, Loki.
4440000	4442000	Why can't you sell through on it?
4442000	4446000	Alright, let's move on. Let's move on to something more modern Dark Sakura.
4446000	4448000	What do you have for us?
4448000	4451000	Five Nights at Freddy's 6.
4451000	4454000	I bet we're all looking forward to it, aren't we?
4454000	4455000	No.
4455000	4457000	Because it's been cancelled.
4457000	4462000	I don't want to cheer. I know the game has its fans, so I'm not going to cheer this, but...
4462000	4466000	I've been hearing that he's trolling his fans, actually, but we'll see.
4466000	4468000	Well, his quote, though, is that,
4468000	4474000	After forcing myself to keep working on it day after day, I realized something. I just don't want to work on this.
4475000	4478000	He thinks each game should be the last.
4478000	4480000	But then...
4480000	4482000	He doesn't want to do it. That's what he said.
4482000	4483000	It might get done.
4483000	4485000	Let me ask a two-part question.
4485000	4487000	Dark Sakura, because you're a fan of Five Nights at Freddy's.
4487000	4488000	Kind of.
4488000	4490000	You've made me play the older games with you.
4490000	4491000	Remember when we did...
4491000	4494000	One of my early Twitch streams was doing Five Nights 4 with you and Shane.
4494000	4495000	Yeah.
4495000	4498000	And that's why I'm like, God, these fucking jumpscares.
4498000	4502000	But, do you think it's possible that maybe it is all a troll?
4502000	4505000	Because he does have a tendency to do these things where he's like,
4505000	4507000	Oh, it's going to release in October.
4507000	4509000	Just kidding. It's out today.
4509000	4512000	I don't know. I kind of don't care anymore.
4512000	4515000	Do you think the series has just jumped the shark in general?
4515000	4519000	I don't know. I mean, it's fans. There's people who will play it.
4519000	4524000	But, at this point, I don't really get excited about releases anymore.
4524000	4526000	Only a few here and there.
4526000	4528000	Or about people working on them.
4528000	4531000	Because every time I get excited about it, my heart gets broken.
4531000	4536000	So, I just don't care anymore.
4536000	4540000	I will see the game when it's out and then I will be excited.
4540000	4543000	Was Five Nights at Freddy World that bad? I'm just kidding.
4543000	4545000	I didn't play it, honestly.
4545000	4549000	I think a lot of people passed on it after hearing some of the initial responses.
4549000	4553000	But, at the same time, I can also kind of...
4553000	4557000	Like, I can completely sympathize with this guy if it's not a troll.
4557000	4561000	And this is like, I'm really ready to fucking do something else.
4561000	4564000	And I think that's kind of what Five Nights at Freddy World was.
4564000	4569000	Is this guy probably feels like, oh my god, this is the only thing I can ever do.
4569000	4572000	And maybe he's kind of getting sick of it. You know what I mean?
4572000	4577000	Like, I've always said, we'll stop doing OLR when we stop having fun with it.
4577000	4581000	You know? So, maybe if this guy is not having fun with it anymore.
4581000	4586000	Or is seeing the joy in it and wants to do other projects that he does see joy in.
4586000	4590000	Even if they don't turn out as great, like Five Nights at Freddy World started.
4590000	4594000	Maybe he has the right to go do it, right? That's art!
4594000	4599000	At any rate, he says he's not abandoning the series.
4599000	4602000	So, we'll see what that means.
4602000	4605000	He should just sell it to Microsoft.
4605000	4607000	See what they do with it.
4607000	4611000	Alright, but there's still a movie happening at some point, I think, right?
4611000	4613000	Yeah, we'll see.
4613000	4615000	Alright, Loki, what's next?
4615000	4621000	Alright, so on the mobile game front, definitely things are going pretty well.
4621000	4630000	So, there has been apparently 150 million plus downloads of Super Mario Run.
4630000	4634000	Now, it's not necessarily purchases, but just at least downloads of that.
4634000	4639000	They don't mention how many of those are actually purchases.
4639000	4647000	They're saying though that they have, apparently Fire Emblem Heroes is doing pretty well as well.
4647000	4653000	So, they've made, I guess they have 15 million downloads with that.
4653000	4658000	They're saying though that there's still people paying for that as well.
4658000	4662000	And then, of course, Animal Crossing will be coming soon.
4662000	4667000	They haven't really updated us on Animal Crossing or Zelda or any of those other mobile projects they're working on, huh?
4667000	4668000	No, not yet.
4668000	4673000	And then on Pokemon Go front, there is the anniversary of Pokemon Go.
4673000	4679000	So, starting July 6th, they're going to be running an event through July 24th.
4679000	4685000	And you'll be able to catch a special Pikachu with Ash Ketchum's hat.
4685000	4689000	So, good luck finding that because I found at least the last event.
4689000	4692000	And I'm not sure about this one because I haven't seen any Pikachus yet.
4692000	4696000	But for some stupid reason, there's no Pikachus that spawn during the entire event.
4696000	4700000	But hey, there is something that you can get your hands on.
4700000	4703000	That's a special anniversary box in the store.
4703000	4705000	Yeah, buy that fucking consumable shit.
4705000	4707000	It's a horrible value.
4707000	4712000	Unless you really like Ultra Balls and Max Survives, it's a horrible value.
4712000	4714000	Like, they've done some boxes.
4714000	4716000	They did some when Gen 2 came out.
4716000	4718000	They did some boxes that were a really good deal.
4718000	4719000	These are not.
4719000	4724000	So, I would just really think twice before buying it.
4724000	4727000	I mean, because I think it's as much.
4727000	4732000	The box costs as much as the raid passes and the incubators would anyway.
4732000	4735000	And then it's like they kind of throw in some Ultra Balls and stuff.
4735000	4737000	It's not the best deal.
4737000	4743000	So, usually check your game once in a while because usually Pikachu spawns here at the house.
4743000	4744000	Have you caught one with the hat yet?
4744000	4747000	No, I haven't. I haven't been very diligent looking.
4747000	4750000	And it seems like when those events happen, that's when the Pikachus stop spawning here.
4750000	4751000	Exactly.
4751000	4755000	That's what happened last time with the party hat or something like that.
4755000	4756000	Like, none of them.
4756000	4760000	I was looking for it and nothing would spawn with the Pikachu.
4760000	4768000	So, I can tell you a place downtown, like a park, that I think I heard is a Pikachu nest right now, downtown.
4768000	4770000	So, it's not a good place to look.
4771000	4773000	Downtown too far for you, Logie?
4773000	4774000	Yeah, it is too far.
4774000	4776000	Just to get a stupid party hat on a character.
4776000	4779000	I don't care. Pikachu's shit anyways in the game.
4780000	4782000	Yeah, it's kind of sad. I never use my Pikachu or Raichu.
4782000	4787000	Pikachu's are fucking impossible to catch and they're just shit.
4787000	4789000	So, I don't know.
4790000	4793000	Why are the starter Pokemon so hard to catch? It makes no sense.
4794000	4796000	Have you done any of the raiding at all? The raidings are fun.
4796000	4797000	Yeah, I've done the raiding.
4797000	4803000	There's a Flareon on your park over here that's on the raid right now.
4803000	4806000	But I'm like, eh, I have a bunch of those.
4806000	4812000	Boy, those raids pop up frequently. We just caught a Magikarp there earlier.
4812000	4813000	Those are funny.
4813000	4819000	Magikarp can be a raid, but sometimes it's kind of like, well, if I don't do this, I'm not going to do any raid today.
4819000	4823000	Well, plus the Magikarp that you catch, they're almost always wonders.
4823000	4825000	So, they're really good for getting Gyarados.
4825000	4830000	Somebody pointed this out last week, is that you don't get wonders and eggs anymore.
4830000	4833000	I'm sorry, you don't get Magikarp's and eggs anymore.
4833000	4835000	So, if you want to wonder Magikarp, you have to do the raid.
4835000	4837000	So, it's a good way to get that.
4837000	4843000	And I hear shinies seem to be showing up more on the raid thing, but I have yet to get the shiny.
4843000	4849000	So, anyway, let's talk about one more thing here before we get to the classic game of the week.
4849000	4852000	And that has to do with the whole toys to games phenomenon.
4852000	4855000	Or how the breaks are kind of on that right now.
4855000	4859000	You know, Activision isn't doing a new Skylanders game this year.
4859000	4860000	You probably noticed.
4860000	4862000	Yeah, they've run out of ideas like several years in a row.
4862000	4864000	They weren't there at E3 this year.
4864000	4867000	So, what's the deal? Is Activision done with Skylanders?
4867000	4872000	Did the death of Disney Infinity lead to toys to games kind of going away?
4872000	4879000	Well, there's a comment here from Activision's CEO that was being interviewed here.
4879000	4883000	It is trying to look up the guy's name.
4883000	4889000	There it is. Eric Hirschberg, the CEO of Activision, said a new market has been created with Skylanders.
4889000	4895000	It was a way of making toys relevant to 21st century kids who are interactive entertainment consumers in their DNA.
4895000	4899000	And so, on one level, it wasn't surprising to see that rush into the genre.
4899000	4902000	But it certainly did create a more difficult macro environment.
4902000	4904000	Skylanders, we're still behind it.
4904000	4909000	We have supported Imaginators with expansion packs in the way that we didn't with previous games.
4909000	4912000	We have a great Skylanders TV series on Netflix.
4912000	4914000	I had no idea that Skylanders was on Netflix.
4914000	4918000	Yeah, great to stretch, but yeah, they do have a series on Netflix.
4918000	4922000	I guess Netflix does really try to get a lot of kids programming because Netflix is kind of great for that.
4922000	4925000	I try to get my kids to watch it and they didn't want to.
4925000	4929000	Also mentioning, we have a mobile game in development that we're really excited about.
4929000	4932000	And we're going to see what the right way to continue to invest in it.
4932000	4934000	What I know is that people love those characters in that world.
4934000	4936000	There's nothing broken about the franchise.
4936000	4941000	It just became a little bit more different as a business proposition with all that competition.
4941000	4943000	We shall see how it plays out.
4943000	4944000	Well, there you go.
4944000	4946000	But there wasn't that much competition.
4946000	4953000	In fact, actually I would say last year there was just Lego Dimensions and that was your only competition.
4953000	4957000	Well, Bobby Blackwolf in chat over at live.voguenetwork.com says,
4957000	4961000	Rumors and sources a few months ago said that Lego Dimensions has been discontinued as well.
4961000	4965000	They allegedly canceled some of the year two expansion packs.
4965000	4966000	Womp womp.
4966000	4968000	I'm fine with that.
4968000	4970000	They put out a ton of content.
4970000	4973000	Yeah, they did support that one game with a shit ton of content.
4973000	4977000	To be fair, I'm blaming Lego for this.
4977000	4980000	That shit's fucking expensive.
4980000	4984000	It's a stupid Lego upcharge and all that shit.
4984000	4986000	Those packs are too damn expensive.
4986000	4988000	The characters are too damn expensive.
4988000	4989000	I love Legos.
4989000	4992000	I would totally buy all those without even owning the game.
4992000	4996000	But that shit is too fucking expensive to own as it is now.
4996000	4999000	Yeah, I hear you. I hear you.
4999000	5003000	Alright, well you know what? Let's travel back to a simpler time, shall we?
5003000	5008000	When you didn't have to have extra toys. Toys were toys. Figures were figures.
5008000	5011000	And you used your imagination to play them.
5011000	5014000	And meanwhile you had your console that was for your video games.
5014000	5017000	And you needed a controller and maybe a power glove.
5017000	5018000	But that was it.
5018000	5020000	And incoherent screaming.
5020000	5025000	It's time for the classic game of the week where Dark Soccer is going to step into the vault and find a game that she thinks,
5025000	5029000	Hey, you brats, you should be checking out this game this week instead.
5029000	5031000	Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?
5031000	5034000	I picked Dragon Ball Z Hyperdimension.
5034000	5041000	Which came out for Super Famicom in Japan on March 29th, 1996.
5041000	5047000	And for Super Nintendo in Europe in February 1997.
5047000	5053000	This is also the last of the Dragon Ball Z games to come out for the Super Famicom.
5053000	5060000	It basically follows the anime. It went through the Frieza stuff, the Kid Buu stuff.
5062000	5066000	You have to continue credits after certain characters' deaths.
5066000	5070000	And some of it is not quite perfect with the story.
5070000	5075000	But the thing that I really liked about this game in particular is the desperation moves.
5075000	5083000	You basically start off with a life bar of 99 points or whatever.
5083000	5090000	And you can charge it from 1 to 99. Sorry, I was missing that.
5090000	5096000	But when it hits below 80 you get your desperation moves that cause higher damage.
5096000	5099000	And it also has different tiers on the levels.
5099000	5104000	So you can fly and hit from your different levels.
5104000	5108000	You can do the background and foreground kind of like in Fatal Fury.
5108000	5111000	And it was just a really solid fighting game.
5111000	5117000	The other thing too is that since this was a later Super Famicom game.
5117000	5120000	The sprites are super gorgeous.
5120000	5125000	I mean it's one of the prettiest, I would say, fighting games that came out on the system.
5125000	5131000	It also has a tournament mode so you can play with up to 8 people.
5132000	5138000	In a tournament style game, I mean pretty much it's called tournament mode.
5138000	5147000	But you also have a full practice mode for practicing your attacks and all of that too.
5147000	5156000	And you can also do an extra type of versus mode that lets you either fight against a character.
5156000	5162000	Or for 2 players against each other. It's how it was with fighting games.
5162000	5164000	The thing I liked was the tournament mode.
5164000	5169000	And I was lucky enough one time to play a tournament mode with this game when I was in college.
5169000	5171000	It was really fun.
5171000	5175000	You've got a cast of 8 characters.
5175000	5179000	And you've got some non-playable characters.
5180000	5185000	The story mode in here is a little bit different.
5185000	5189000	It didn't have exactly the right characterizations for who played what.
5189000	5192000	But it was a really good game.
5192000	5205000	On top of that, you also have special fights that you can do if you clear a story mode without using a Senzu Bean.
5205000	5209000	And one of them is fighting Gotenks, which is actually a fun fight.
5209000	5213000	So anyway, there's really not much to say about this game.
5213000	5217000	It only came out on the Super Famicom.
5217000	5220000	It wasn't released for any other system.
5220000	5225000	One of the disappointing things about this is that it didn't have my favorite character in it.
5225000	5227000	Which was playing Future Trunks.
5227000	5229000	But it was also the first one that you could play as Buen.
5229000	5231000	And that was pretty cool.
5231000	5236000	But the game that was just...
5236000	5241000	I mean, I could talk about Shinbutoden, which was on Saturn.
5241000	5245000	I still think this is honestly almost a better game.
5245000	5247000	And that's it.
5247000	5250000	Dragon Ball Z Hyperdimension.
5250000	5251000	But this is not...
5251000	5256000	Now, you'll have to forgive me because my knowledge on the import games for Super Nintendo is not as strong.
5256000	5260000	But this is not the only Dragon Ball Z game on Super Nintendo, right?
5260000	5263000	Because I remember playing one, but it wasn't this.
5263000	5266000	Because I'm looking at this and I'm like, no, this is not the game I played.
5266000	5272000	No, there was Super Butoden 2 and then 3.
5272000	5275000	And then Hyperdimension was the last one.
5275000	5284000	And then they went on to the Saturn one, which had Shinbutoden and Ultimate Battle 22 for PlayStation.
5284000	5290000	And then we had GT, which actually GT was the first one that came out, out here.
5290000	5295000	Which I sold that game so fast. It was not very good.
5295000	5299000	I kind of wish I waited to sell it because it was worth some money.
5299000	5302000	You know, and I got rid of it at the wrong time.
5302000	5305000	But hey, it's a fun game though.
5305000	5309000	I wouldn't say that it's among my favorites of the series.
5309000	5314000	I honestly do like Super Butoden 3 a little bit better than this one.
5314000	5319000	But it is notable as being one of the last games in the series on that system.
5319000	5322000	And also it's just fucking pretty.
5322000	5324000	It was a very late Super Nintendo release in general.
5324000	5327000	It was. It's really, really well done.
5327000	5332000	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Dragon Ball Z Hyperdimension.
5332000	5334000	Dark Soccer's been on a Dragon Ball kick lately.
5334000	5338000	I figured I'd have to mention one of the games since I haven't done one before.
5338000	5341000	Yeah, fair enough. I mean, there were a ton.
5341000	5346000	Also, it was back in a day when the internet wasn't as prolific.
5346000	5348000	As in, it wasn't there.
5348000	5352000	So, we didn't really get knowledge of a lot of those games that were in Japan only.
5352000	5353000	You know what I mean?
5353000	5356000	So, when we'd hear about them, it was like, why didn't we get this game?
5356000	5361000	We had to order from importers that you found in the back of EGM.
5361000	5362000	Yeah.
5362000	5365000	Which is actually how I bought my first import game.
5365000	5367000	Which is the Sailor Moon S fighting game.
5367000	5372000	It had Chibi Moon's butt attack.
5372000	5376000	I just remember the video store by me when I grew up,
5376000	5380000	like, randomly rented some Super Famicom games,
5380000	5383000	but they would have the converter with it,
5383000	5386000	so that way when you rented it, you just plug it into your Super Nintendo.
5386000	5389000	And the Dragon Ball, one of those Dragon Ball fighting games, I don't remember which one,
5389000	5392000	but I would say it's the one that opens with the guy screaming,
5392000	5394000	but I realize I could literally be any of them.
5394000	5396000	That's any of them. It opens with someone screaming.
5396000	5402000	So, but that was the first game I ever rented that was a Famicom game,
5402000	5405000	but I played it on my Super Nintendo, and that was pretty cool.
5405000	5410000	Now, right before I moved out here, I came across,
5410000	5414000	I had the Ranma ½ hard battle that came out in the US,
5414000	5422000	and I found that they had the Japanese hard battle at this used game shop,
5422000	5425000	and they couldn't sell it because no one wanted to buy it.
5425000	5427000	It's Alabama. No one wanted to buy a game in Japanese.
5427000	5433000	So I traded my copy, my US one for their Japanese one,
5433000	5436000	because I had already made the mods to my game genie to play it,
5436000	5439000	and I was so happy because I had all the good voices.
5439000	5443000	So that's my story about the Ranma ½ hard battle fighting game.
5443000	5444000	All right.
5444000	5446000	And I still have that copy too.
5446000	5449000	Well, we're going to take a quick break, you guys.
5449000	5452000	We'll be back, though. There's plenty more Orange Long Trader to come.
5452000	5455000	We got more news, I think at least one email tonight,
5455000	5459000	and phone calls at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype
5459000	5464000	when we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5470000	5474000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio Live tonight,
5474000	5480000	July 9th, 2017, episode number 693 of our show already in progress,
5480000	5482000	and moving into the second half of the show.
5482000	5486000	You know, I realized I forgot a game that I played this week
5486000	5488000	because it was so fast.
5488000	5491000	So Steam obviously had their huge sale, right?
5491000	5496000	So I did do a little live stream of Pac-Man Championship Edition 2
5496000	5498000	because I ended up buying that on Steam
5498000	5500000	because it was only like five bucks or something like that,
5500000	5502000	which last week, didn't we get an email that was like,
5502000	5504000	what did you buy in the Steam sale?
5504000	5506000	And at that point, I was like, nothing, but I probably will.
5506000	5507000	Yeah.
5507000	5508000	Yeah, well, I did.
5508000	5511000	But, you know, part of the whole Steam sale is that
5511000	5513000	around the time the Steam sale happens,
5513000	5516000	all these other, like, Microsoft was having a big sale on Xbox,
5516000	5517000	PlayStation had a big sale.
5517000	5519000	There's still happening a sale, actually.
5519000	5521000	Is the PlayStation 1 still going on, too, or no?
5521000	5522000	Yeah, I checked it the other day.
5522000	5529000	Okay, so I bought for like $3.74 or something like that, $3.74.
5529000	5535000	It was like a trio of old-ass arcade games, Pac-Man, Dig Dug, and Galaga.
5535000	5538000	And I was like, oh, sure, I've had collections of these games before,
5538000	5540000	but what the hell, it's like three bucks.
5540000	5543000	So I picked up that and I started playing Dig Dug.
5543000	5548000	And as I'm playing Dig Dug, oh, my God, I was popping like a trophy every five seconds.
5548000	5553000	It was like, you got a fruit, trophy, you exploded a monster, trophy,
5553000	5558000	you crushed two monsters with a rock, trophy, you beat round one, trophy,
5558000	5560000	you beat round two, trophy.
5560000	5564000	There was like so, for like a game that I essentially played a dollar for,
5564000	5567000	there was probably like 30 trophies in Dig Dug.
5567000	5570000	Now, don't get me wrong, I think that's pretty cool.
5570000	5573000	I know we talked a little bit about the whole trophy thing last week at the top of the show,
5573000	5578000	but I think it's neat when you take an old-school arcade game like Dig Dug
5578000	5582000	and do something modern to it like that, like trophies, but I was just like, dang.
5582000	5585000	I didn't realize how freaking loaded this game was with achievements.
5585000	5586000	I started going through the list.
5586000	5591000	I was like, wow, they not only brought in the stuff from the Xbox 360 version of the game
5591000	5594000	where you can dig out the entire board and get a trophy that way,
5594000	5596000	but there was all sorts of stuff in there.
5596000	5599000	So I thought that was just kind of funny.
5599000	5604000	Something else, speaking of live streaming, because I did do that live stream.
5604000	5609000	It's probably the only live stream I did this week was that stream of Pac-Man Championship Edition 2.
5609000	5615000	I don't know if you guys saw in the office, but Alan bought me for my birthday a green screen.
5615000	5616000	I saw.
5616000	5618000	I know you said that. I haven't watched.
5618000	5622000	At some point, go peek in the office because Alan's gaming there right now.
5622000	5626000	It's like that room is split in two now with this giant green screen on PC.
5626000	5629000	I was like, do we have an unknown spat?
5629000	5633000	I know, right. Doesn't it look like that thing that siblings do when they're having a fight?
5633000	5634000	They draw a line down the screen.
5634000	5636000	Yeah, I draw a line down the screen. This is your side of the room.
5636000	5641000	No, it's kind of what it looks like now. It's really funny, and it confuses the hell out of the cat.
5641000	5644000	Unfortunately, because it gets really hot in there, like when I'm not using the green screen,
5644000	5650000	I have to throw it up over the PVC pipe, but I don't want to wrinkle it because that fucks it up.
5650000	5653000	But I have to get the airflow in there because, my God, it can get so...
5653000	5657000	Because, you know, here in Northern California, in the valley, it's like what?
5657000	5660000	Yesterday was 105, I think. It's been crazy hot over here.
5660000	5662000	So, yeah, crazy, crazy.
5662000	5666000	Anyway, go to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
5666000	5673000	Dart Tetsuya says, I want to say Pac-Man Championship Edition Deluxe Plus was kind of like that with the trophies.
5673000	5679000	Yeah, well, I think it had a handful of trophies, but then they had all their in-game achievements, too, which was interesting.
5679000	5683000	So, yeah. But anyway, just something else I want to throw out there for my gaming week.
5683000	5688000	Old-ass retro stuff. Pac-Man and Dig Dug, even if it is a newer Pac-Man game.
5688000	5692000	And then the green screen, which is... It's still not working perfectly.
5692000	5697000	We have to do this whole thing because there's still folds in it because when they mail it to you, it's all folded.
5697000	5700000	And the folds are causing the green to not pick up right.
5700000	5704000	And yes, I've been in OBS Chroma Key settings and changing everything.
5704000	5706000	What's it made out of?
5706000	5709000	Seriously, it could be a piece of fabric you bought at Jo-Ann's.
5709000	5716000	You know what? Get a wet towel, put it in your dryer, and then tack the end down.
5716000	5717000	Actually, the thing...
5717000	5719000	Or wait, the bottom.
5719000	5724000	So, Alan went online to try to troubleshoot this, and it's a similar idea.
5724000	5730000	We saw a thing that was get a spray bottle, as your screen is hanging, spray down the screen,
5730000	5735000	but not enough so that it's actually dripping water off it, but just enough to be wet.
5735000	5737000	And then as it dries, it won't be wrinkled anymore.
5737000	5739000	I thought that was an interesting solution.
5739000	5745000	You can also get an iron with a steam function.
5745000	5746000	Yeah.
5746000	5748000	And air steam it.
5748000	5753000	Tiger Kyle also points out, green screens require a good amount of lighting in order for it to work properly.
5753000	5754000	Oh yes, I'm aware.
5754000	5756000	I have another light, but here's the thing.
5756000	5761000	So the green screen kit, it did come with a light, but I'm a little afraid to use it because of the heat.
5761000	5764000	But it is an LED light, so I'm thinking it won't be so bad.
5764000	5766000	It shouldn't put off any heat.
5766000	5768000	Yeah, I just need to fucking try it.
5768000	5771000	But when I look at it, I go, oh my god, I'm not going to use that in the middle of summer.
5771000	5775000	But I think it's an LED light, so you're right, it wouldn't put off any heat.
5775000	5779000	Like this guy here, right next to us in the studio, this puts off heat because this is the more traditional bulb.
5779000	5783000	Which is part of the reason why it starts to get freaking hot in here during the show.
5783000	5786000	But I don't think the LED light would be as bad.
5786000	5788000	Maybe I should sub this out for the LED light.
5788000	5790000	It would be cooler in here doing all our...
5790000	5791000	Anyway.
5791000	5794000	Yeah, as 2100matt points out, Travis has a green screen on his show for a while.
5794000	5796000	He got it to work well.
5796000	5800000	Yes, when I did my stream the other night and I was using the green screen, I did space.
5800000	5802000	Just like Travis used to do.
5802000	5805000	So, you know, a little homage I suppose. There you go.
5805000	5808000	Alright, moving on. We've got to get to some more video game news.
5808000	5810000	Let's do some rapid fire news. Loki.
5810000	5817000	So this was surprising because I sort of remembered this was a thing that they were teasing last year or something.
5817000	5826000	The Tomorrow Children, which is a game that was one of those strange games that they had during an E3 trailer reel that they were doing.
5827000	5834000	And I guess it did actually come out back in September and is now being shut down November 1st.
5834000	5837000	Because apparently it's not very popular. But that was pretty quick.
5837000	5838000	Only 10 months.
5838000	5843000	Well, it's 10 months and they've already announced that it's shutting down.
5843000	5846000	So I guess it will be out for about 14 months.
5846000	5850000	Wow. That's quick.
5850000	5853000	And then of course, you know, this is kind of cool.
5853000	5858000	I did play a little bit of this on PC, but Thimbleweed Park is headed to Switch.
5858000	5867000	So that's Ron Gilbert's new game. If you're a fan of, like, Maniac Mansion or, say, the Monkey Island series, you'll love this game.
5867000	5872000	So that's going to be coming out on Switch soon. Right now it's currently out on PC and Xbox One.
5874000	5879000	This is a game I've heard a lot about, but I just haven't really gotten around to playing yet. So I wanted to check that out.
5879000	5880000	It's pretty good.
5880000	5881000	Yeah, cool.
5881000	5889000	So we mentioned earlier in the show the Castlevania series. We personally have not got around to watching it yet, but I know a lot of you guys have and I'm hearing a lot of good things about it.
5889000	5895000	But here's the deal. The Castlevania series on Netflix has already been renewed for Season 2.
5895000	5901000	So there it is. Just hours after the first four episodes went live, they renewed it for Season 2.
5901000	5905000	So there must have been a lot of people hitting it right away or they just had a good feeling based on the buzz or whatever.
5905000	5907000	So yeah, cool.
5907000	5915000	Season 2 is going to double the episode count. So there will be eight episodes for Season 2 as opposed to the four we had for Episode 1.
5915000	5921000	No word on who's going to write it and so forth, but yeah, hopefully that'll work out well and the fans will be pleased.
5921000	5928000	And I did allude to this earlier in the show, but let me mention this about Blaster Master Zero officially.
5928000	5930000	I think this is really rad.
5930000	5932000	New DLC that's available in the game.
5932000	5941000	You know, Gunvolt and Galgun were already added as characters in the game previously and I'm so mad because I missed the free period for Galgun.
5941000	5944000	Stupid me forgot to check the game and I missed the period.
5944000	5950000	But I have some chances to get some other characters because they just announced two more characters.
5950000	5955000	I think they announced this at Anime Expo, two more characters that are going to be joining the lineup for Blaster Master Zero.
5955000	5962000	Shantae, you stay, in Blaster Master Zero, but obviously Shantae from The Pirate's Curse and all that.
5962000	5969000	She is the character that just went live a couple days ago and then Shovel Knight is being added into Blaster Master Zero 2.
5969000	5971000	That's awesome.
5971000	5978000	So what's cool about it is that they bring their abilities into the Blaster Master format so it feels like you're playing a crossover game.
5978000	5979000	So it's pretty rad.
5979000	5987000	And again, the other thing I really love about the way Blaster Master Zero has been doing the DLC is that for the first two weeks, the DLC is free.
5987000	5992000	Now granted, stupid me, I missed it, but that's my own fault on Galgun.
5992000	5996000	But you know I grabbed Shantae the minute she went up.
5996000	6001000	I think it's really cool because that means if you're loyal, you already bought the game when it first came out.
6001000	6007000	You have a chance to stock up on this DLC whereas people who come late to the party, they're going to have to buy it.
6007000	6011000	So I think that's a really cool thing to do for the early supporters of the game.
6011000	6015000	So props to the team behind this game.
6015000	6021000	I'm that gif right now of, who is that, Tajari P. Henson with the cell phone going,
6021000	6024000	You're doing great, sweetie. You're doing great, sweetie.
6024000	6026000	That's me right now with this game.
6026000	6032000	Alright, moving on to Dark Sakura.
6032000	6036000	Well, we brought up the Night Trap 25th Edition.
6036000	6046000	Well, there is another, and I'm using Cody Fingers mode in it, which is a survivor feature, which is really just the regular game.
6046000	6056000	That you have enemies running all over the place and you have to decrease their number until you save everybody.
6056000	6062000	It's the same thing, but at least they're trying to do things with it, so whatever.
6062000	6065000	Isn't that supposed to be without all the other cutscenes or something like that?
6065000	6073000	Yeah, something like that, but you're supposed to just see the proper scenes anyway when you go through all the monitors, so whatever.
6073000	6083000	And then for Mass Effect Andromeda, the last patch that came out removed the Denuvo anti-tamper protection,
6083000	6088000	which has already been proven to be pretty easy to break.
6088000	6093000	There was a challenge that was put out for people to break it and they did it in a few days.
6093000	6096000	They just found out no one wanted to steal the game.
6096000	6098000	Stop it.
6098000	6109000	I honestly look at that as the last sign of giving up, so I'm still angry. Anger.
6109000	6117000	No, I already mentioned this to you last week. I had that moment last week where it finally clicked for me and I get it.
6117000	6119000	It's frustrating.
6119000	6125000	Alright, let's move on to happier things, like games that are coming out in stores this week.
6125000	6127000	I know we already talked about we have a couple big ones, right, Loki?
6127000	6141000	That's correct. This week we've got Final Fantasy XII The Zodiac Age on PlayStation 4, Fable Fortune, that's a card game based off Fable that's coming out on Xbox One and Windows PC,
6141000	6150000	and Derelict Fleet on PC and PlayStation 4, and finally Energy Balance on the Vita. That's it.
6150000	6159000	Traveling to Japan, briefly. Final Fantasy XII The Zodiac Age also getting a Japanese release on the PlayStation 4 this week on July 13th.
6159000	6165000	There's another game also coming out on the PlayStation 4. It's called Hakoniwa Company Works is the name of this game.
6165000	6172000	I'm not sure what this is. It looks like it might be a little bit Minecraft-y, but kind of anime mixed in.
6172000	6178000	But I'm getting a very Minecraft vibe from the graphics, like maybe it's kind of building on the success of something like Dragon Quest Heroes or something.
6178000	6185000	But that is a game that's out on the PlayStation 4 this week. Those are the two really big releases.
6185000	6193000	Nothing really to note on the Nintendo Switch, but the 3DS, there's actually new 2DS-LL, that's what they call it in Japan.
6193000	6199000	The black and turquoise and the white and orange, those are actually hitting Japan this week on July 13th.
6199000	6202000	And so there are a ton of accessories that go with that as well.
6202000	6209000	But as far as games go, you can check out Hey! Pikmin comes out in Japan this week, along with a new figure to go with that.
6209000	6219000	There's also Ever Oasis has another entry in the game. Ever Oasis, Seirei To Tanibito no Miraje comes out this week.
6219000	6222000	So there you go, Japanese releases. How about the UK, DarkSakura?
6222000	6232000	A few things. We have Minecraft Story Mode Season 2 for everything. That's on the 11th, and on the 12th we have The End is Nigh for PC.
6232000	6241000	Alright, there it is. To answer this question in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Kasan in chat says,
6241000	6249000	So is Final Fantasy XII a remake? Pretty much, but it's not the international version.
6249000	6254000	Because they gave it a different name, because they went in and tweaked some stuff with the game.
6254000	6261000	So it's like, you're getting the final edition of the game that had come out in Japan before, but it never came out here before.
6261000	6265000	And what they had tweaked with it is that they kind of redid the job system.
6265000	6273000	Like in Final Fantasy XII you have job boards, and so my understanding is that in the Zodiac Age, you can kind of pick,
6273000	6278000	I think in this one you get to do two different jobs at once. I think originally it was one, now it's two.
6278000	6285000	But it's like you're a little more limited in how you kind of craft your characters once you pick what job types you want them to be.
6285000	6291000	But that also ensures that you don't fuck them up. So it's kind of a double-edged thing there.
6291000	6298000	So it's a little bit, I guess you could say it's like the definitive version of the game of sorts.
6298000	6306000	Because yes, they're also going back and doing the little tweaks here and there similar to what they did with Final Fantasy X to put this on the Playstation 4.
6306000	6312000	Alright, anyhow, let's get to the mailbag. Every week you guys send us emails.
6312000	6318000	Participate at orangeloungeradio.com and we read your emails here live on the show.
6318000	6322000	And yet again, I don't have the damn music to put in the background here.
6322000	6330000	So, oh wait, I found it. I found the song. We finally return to the regular mailbag music.
6330000	6332000	Yay!
6332000	6338000	Dark Sakura, dive in head first and find the email at participate at orangeloungeradio.com.
6338000	6340000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
6340000	6341000	Just one.
6341000	6346000	Hey guys and gal, just wanted to respond to your topic from last week. I love my trophies.
6346000	6347000	Good.
6347000	6351000	I take great pride in my trophies and my trophy count and my 10 platinums.
6351000	6357000	Yeah, I could have gotten more but there are so many games to play. I don't buy a game and say, yes, I'm a platinum this one.
6357000	6364000	For me, it's a show of accomplishment. I could have several friends on PSN that have the same game and maybe they'll have trophies that I don't.
6364000	6370000	I'll investigate to see if it's obtainable and I think that hunting and gathering is more important than the count.
6370000	6373000	Dude, you got that trophy? I've been working on that bitch for a minute.
6373000	6380000	Seeing that someone loved the game so much that they felt compelled to acquire all the trophies isn't always a display of ego fapping.
6380000	6386000	It's a challenge. Hey, we both have the same game. I got this trophy. Can you? It also extends to the gameplay.
6386000	6393000	I can beat a game in no time but to get all the trophies and earn a platinum means that this was one of the best ever.
6393000	6398000	Some games, like The Walking Dead, will dish out a plat just for completing it.
6398000	6403000	Most games will pit you against severe challenges or even optional bosses.
6403000	6408000	I personally won't add someone to my friends list with less than 900 trophies.
6408000	6416000	It's not an ego thing. It's just saying that I take my gaming very seriously and expect that the friends on my console of choice do the same.
6416000	6423000	And I won't buy a game without trophies anymore. I spent $230 in the last few weeks on PSN because of their incredible sales.
6423000	6429000	I didn't buy a single game to earn trophies and I won't buy one without any. That is all.
6429000	6435000	Some people like to beat games on the hardest difficulty just for the street cred. With trophies, I have receipts with dates and times.
6435000	6437000	Thank you for the great show, Recimo.
6439000	6448000	Okay, that's good. I'm glad that you like doing it that way. It's still completely inconsequential to me. I don't think the trophies are at all important.
6448000	6462000	Yeah, I respect this guy's ego and I get the whole, like, when achievements are hard to get, they can really be signs of dedication to the game or whatever.
6462000	6468000	Like, you know, I did work at getting the platinum trophy on Diablo 3 and that was a big accomplishment for me.
6468000	6473000	And why did I do it? Because I liked the game enough and it was a goal for me to go after. Cool!
6473000	6482000	The thing for me is that it's so arbitrary. I'd rather have some kind of big reward for it. Other than that, I'm just doing it because I want to do it.
6482000	6491000	Right. And I seem to remember you did bring up the World of Warcraft you kind of liked because you got mounts and shit for doing things.
6491000	6501000	Yeah, it's like sometimes I would do things like if I was bored, like, supremely bored. But I more play the game for the enjoyment of the game.
6501000	6513000	I'm not... I'm competitive when it counts to be competitive. And when I am playing something that is for fun, unless it's a versus game, I'm not in any sort of competition.
6513000	6522000	I don't need to look at what other people have accomplished to gain a self... a feeling of enjoyment of it.
6522000	6529000	I don't have to look at, oh, well, this person's done this well. I have to do the same. That's not important to me.
6529000	6530000	Right.
6530000	6538000	I... my enjoyment of a game has nothing to do with what other people think of it. Or what other people have done in it. You know.
6538000	6547000	I would have been curious though, you know, because remember this whole conversation started last week because we had that game on the... maybe I missed it in the email, but I don't think I heard it.
6547000	6553000	We had that game on the marketplace last week that was like, what, it was the 99 cent slide puzzle game that was like...
6553000	6554000	Yeah.
6554000	6566000	You get a trophy for pressing X and that whole thing. Like, that's kind of the thing. Remember, because that kind of started the whole conversation was, do trophies mean that much to you that you're going to pay 99 cents to just get trophies?
6566000	6575000	And I don't get that sense from this email, but don't forget that was also kind of part of what started that whole discussion was like, are trophies like that important where it's like you will pay to get them?
6575000	6588000	And I think we all kind of agree that was a little ridiculous. But I'm curious, would this guy have paid a dollar to get those trophies? I'm thinking no based on the email because there's no challenge. There's no reward there.
6588000	6598000	The thing that stuck out to me, and I'm really trying not to be my usual judgmental bitchy self over this, but picking your friends based on their accomplishments.
6599000	6612000	I'm a little worried about that too. That part kind of struck me as, ooh, now maybe if it's like randos on PlayStation 4 and you know if you want to add them or not, I get that. But like, what if it's somebody you know in real life?
6612000	6624000	Like, I'm not sure. Like, I'm kind of just hoping I'm misunderstanding that. Like, would you really like not, would you not put me on your friends list because I don't have 200 trophies? Well, I think I do, but...
6624000	6629000	I'm sure I've got, I don't even care how many I have. I could look.
6629000	6638000	After all this time, I'm sure I have plenty of trophies. But let me, let me challenge this. I don't want to belabor this point too much, but let me challenge this.
6638000	6647000	What if you had a friend who couldn't afford a PlayStation until just now? So they haven't had the time to build up those trophies.
6647000	6654000	But they want to team up with you so they can try to get some. Because there are a lot of trophies for cooperative stuff.
6654000	6659000	I kind of don't think this guy would turn their back on that, but I don't know.
6659000	6662000	You're not my friend anymore. You should have been on board with the...
6662000	6674000	I don't want to put words in dude's mouth either, but I just, you know, when I read that or when I saw that or heard that part of the email, I was a little bit like, ooh, but aren't there exceptions to every rule?
6674000	6683000	Well, it's just, I don't believe that there should be a condition like that unless it is like for random people.
6683000	6692000	But if it's the people that you know, you know, I would think that the point of being friends with them is to be friends with them and to play and enjoy games and talk to them.
6692000	6705000	I really, I hate this whole expectation that these achievements have had. It's a participation award. I mean, yeah, you can participate harder, I guess, and get new ones.
6705000	6715000	But I respect people who enjoy it. More power to you. But don't let that be the only reason for enjoying a game.
6715000	6726000	Yeah. And this, just to be fair to all angles, because that's what I try to do here on this show where every gamer has a voice, to be fair to this guy's angle and going back to World of Warcraft for a minute.
6726000	6740000	I used to see this all the time in World of Warcraft where it was, we are going to do a farming run of X boss, but you need to link me your achievement to prove that you've done it because this isn't a learning group type of thing.
6740000	6753000	I've seen that before. And so maybe if that's kind of like the approach here is that like, I don't want to play ranked matches in Overwatch with you unless you've kind of proven you've gotten certain landmarks in that game.
6753000	6765000	Like to that end, that's not unheard of. That isn't how I choose to do MMOs. I like to do learning stuff and all that, but that's cool if that's what you want to do.
6765000	6771000	I'm certainly not going to tell you how to play your stinking games. So, all right. Good email. Good discussion.
6771000	6783000	JD in chat over at live.vognetware.com says, that must be why I love achievements. It's because I'm a millennial and I want my participation trophies. But he puts a little sarcastic face after that. He's not serious.
6783000	6785000	I want avocado toast.
6786000	6797000	Don't you? Sounds amazing. Actually, do you want to hear like the moment when it's like, am I really from California? I don't really care for avocados.
6797000	6799000	I just like avocados.
6799000	6802000	I like avocados and I'm not from California.
6803000	6817000	Is it one of those things like In-N-Out where the people not from here like it way more than the people who live here do? Although In-N-Out's not bad, but it's just, I'm always blown away how like anybody from out of the area is like, we have to go to In-N-Out. Oh my God.
6817000	6823000	But then again, I used to be the exact same way about Dunkin Donuts until we finally got one here. So who am I to fucking talk, right?
6823000	6825000	Yeah, maybe donuts are kind of eh.
6825000	6835000	But I will say this. I don't hate, I don't have the raging hatred for avocado because I certainly don't dislike it. Like that's mayonnaise. Mayonnaise I fucking hate. Do not get that shit anywhere near me.
6835000	6841000	But like a California roll has avocado in it. I'll eat that. That's fine. I don't care.
6841000	6844000	So what's your opinion on Miracle Whip then?
6846000	6850000	Straight from the seventh circle of hell and the innards of Satan's butthole.
6850000	6852000	But it's not mayonnaise really.
6852000	6855000	But it's worse. It's imitation mayonnaise.
6856000	6859000	It's salad dressing and not even good.
6860000	6867000	I will say this. I only eat one brand of mayonnaise if it's not handmade. Just saying.
6867000	6871000	Oh yeah. I've heard of that too. Like there's like certain brands that people only have.
6871000	6878000	I grew up on Hellmann's, which out here is best foods. And I've had like the olive oil one and it's okay.
6878000	6882000	But if it's not made by hand then it has to be that one brand.
6882000	6887000	But isn't that weird? You can still get Hellmann's at Target even though it's all best foods here.
6887000	6889000	Well yeah you can get it at a grocery outlet too.
6889000	6890000	It's weird.
6890000	6896000	Actually when I see a Hellmann's one I have to buy it because it's that little bit of homesickness you know.
6896000	6901000	And to be clear since now I've got everybody in chat talking about donuts. It's the coffee.
6901000	6905000	It was never about the donuts. Like don't get me wrong. I can't pass up one of those filled donuts.
6905000	6912000	But usually like here in California where Dunkin' is not nearly as prolific. We have like two in the entire Sacramento area.
6912000	6916000	It's the Ma and Pa donut shops are like everywhere and they're great.
6916000	6922000	Yeah the Dunkin' Donuts that's nearby to me. They're dead all the time.
6922000	6923000	Oh really?
6923000	6924000	I want one now.
6926000	6932000	Alright. Moving on. And then in chat. Crazy Chocobonator hands Rob Roberts a mayo and miracle whip sandwich.
6933000	6939000	If you want to wear that sandwich then that would be a smart thing to do. But if you don't I would advise against that.
6939000	6944000	Like I always have friends that are like oh I'm going to get you a jar of mayonnaise for birthday as a joke.
6944000	6949000	I'm like okay first of all jokes are funny. Second of all do you want to wear that?
6949000	6954000	Like I fucking hate mayonnaise. It is gross.
6954000	6956000	I also like Kewpie mayonnaise.
6956000	6957000	Really?
6957000	6958000	The Japanese one.
6958000	6960000	But I like it for a topping on things.
6960000	6965000	And oh my god. Here's my biggest pet peeve. I went into a restaurant once. I'm like does this have mayonnaise on it?
6965000	6968000	And they're like no it's a garlic aioli. And I'm like that's fucking mayonnaise.
6968000	6973000	I know your fucking code languages to make basic ingredients sound fancy.
6975000	6976000	Anyway.
6978000	6979000	Garlic mayolis.
6980000	6984000	Bobby Black Wolf in chat says I actually don't get mayo on my stuff when I'm around Rob.
6984000	6989000	I don't care. Other people can have it on a sandwich or whatever you want to do.
6989000	6993000	Alan likes it. He fucking makes me watch him buy it at the store.
6993000	6999000	But love makes you do crazy things so I allow him to buy the mayonnaise.
6999000	7002000	I just say put it in the little part in the fridge where I don't have to look at it.
7002000	7003000	Alright.
7004000	7008000	Let's move on. It's a video game show. Not a what food do I hate show. Loki.
7009000	7014000	So there's a game that's called Intelligent Design and Evolutionary Sandbox.
7014000	7019000	And apparently there's still one achievement that no one has been able to crack yet.
7019000	7024000	That one trophy. So the final Steam achievement is called Code Breaker.
7024000	7032000	And what Code Breaker is it's basically a code that they have to solve in order to get this last achievement.
7032000	7035000	And if they get the last achievement what do they get as a reward?
7035000	7040000	Not just the trophy but they get the source code released for the game.
7040000	7045000	So the game itself is more of like kind of designing your own ecosystem on a barren planet.
7045000	7051000	And what the creator said is now the source code is not going to necessarily allow them to,
7051000	7055000	you know, it won't answer all the questions on how to build the perfect ecosystem.
7055000	7062000	But it will give them something else to explore which is what my game is all about.
7063000	7070000	And so, you know, basically kind of hinting at, you know, here's how you might be able to get some tips to make it better.
7070000	7071000	I don't know.
7071000	7074000	But I think it's kind of neat though that they're offering up the source code.
7074000	7076000	But yeah, no one's really figured it out yet.
7076000	7079000	There's little bits of hints coming through different parts of the game.
7079000	7088000	So they have like these kind of like wormhole portal things that are kind of spitting out some characters that are part of this.
7088000	7090000	But no one's seen the crack yet.
7091000	7092000	It's neat.
7093000	7096000	Good way to kind of get that viral buzz on the game, I guess.
7096000	7099000	Especially when sometimes it's hard to be noticed on Steam.
7099000	7101000	Like this might be a good way to do it.
7101000	7106000	I mean, it's probably not incentive for you, Loki, because you're not playing this game.
7106000	7109000	But do you kind of get where people might find incentive in that?
7109000	7110000	Yeah, I mean, definitely.
7110000	7118000	I mean, there was like I remember the whole Chiliad stuff with Grand Theft Auto that people were kind of searching for Easter eggs with that and all sorts of cryptography stuff with that.
7118000	7127000	And then come to find out there's really nothing there and their Easter egg mission that they have now is kind of crap.
7127000	7130000	Which, by the way, they finally figured out how to actually unlock that mission.
7130000	7137000	So you have to do 600 gun running missions and then you trigger a gun running mission at night.
7137000	7141000	And if you do it at the right time, you get that Easter egg one.
7141000	7143000	But that's kind of lame.
7143000	7145000	It's not a jet pack.
7146000	7149000	Alright, well let's talk about Rayman.
7149000	7151000	But not a new Rayman game.
7151000	7153000	An old Rayman game.
7153000	7154000	A very old Rayman game.
7154000	7160000	There was actually a Rayman Super Nintendo version that was under development and there was even a prototype demo.
7160000	7164000	That was put online by a developer at Lizardcube.
7164000	7167000	And you can actually download this.
7167000	7168000	So it was pretty cool.
7168000	7170000	Twitter user Oakornut.
7170000	7171000	I hope I said that right.
7172000	7173000	Actually put that up.
7173000	7177000	He's the developer at Lizardcube that put that up on Dropbox and you can check that out.
7177000	7181000	Because, you know, this is years old and it's not like anybody's going to lose money off this.
7181000	7182000	So there you go.
7182000	7187000	Previously there were images on Twitter posted when the prototype was found to still be working.
7187000	7189000	So if you want to check that out, you can.
7189000	7193000	Although keep in mind because it is a prototype, it's not going to be perfect.
7193000	7196000	If it was perfect, they would have released the damn thing.
7196000	7197000	But they didn't.
7197000	7200000	JD in chat says, Rayman for Super Nintendo Mini.
7201000	7202000	Wouldn't that be something?
7202000	7207000	But I guess one unfinished game that they actually went back and finished still blows my mind.
7207000	7208000	I guess that's enough.
7209000	7210000	Alright, moving on.
7210000	7211000	Dark Sakura.
7212000	7221000	Well, there is a book coming out that is honoring a phenomenon that we don't really see so much anymore.
7222000	7228000	But it's the bad video game translation book.
7230000	7234000	It's called This Be Book Bad Translation Video Games.
7234000	7235000	That's awesome.
7236000	7241000	And like one of the pictures in there is like, you are a sucking baby.
7243000	7249000	And of course we're going to have, you know, probably the all your base and all that.
7249000	7251000	But it feels like it's inspired by that.
7251000	7253000	Here is a graveyard of you.
7254000	7259000	So I don't know. I kind of have to have this book now.
7261000	7265000	Yeah, I was looking at some of the little screenshots that, you know, the demo pages they have out there.
7265000	7266000	It looks pretty funny.
7266000	7267000	Apparently it's $15.
7267000	7270000	That's a fun little coffee table book for a nerd.
7271000	7272000	I like it.
7272000	7275000	I think it would be fun. Yeah, I might have to pick this up.
7276000	7278000	Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
7278000	7279000	I'll link it in the chat room.
7279000	7283000	Kasa Ninchat says, please tell me they have Harvest Moon screenshots.
7283000	7286000	I'm sure any of the legendary stuff is in there.
7287000	7290000	S2100 Matt says, all your base are belong to us has to be in it.
7291000	7293000	Oh yeah, that's one of the big pictures.
7294000	7295000	All right.
7296000	7298000	Moving on, just a couple more stories for you guys.
7298000	7299000	Then we're going to open up the Skype line.
7299000	7300000	See if you guys have anything to say.
7300000	7303000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
7303000	7304000	But first, Loki.
7304000	7311000	All right, so this is a pretty cool follow up to something we had talked about just a few weeks ago.
7311000	7319000	So remember the whole thing with Rockstar Games kind of banning modding tools for the single player and stuff like that?
7319000	7320000	I do.
7320000	7321000	I do.
7321000	7322000	With Open 4?
7322000	7323000	Well, Open 4 is back.
7323000	7325000	So they re-enabled the downloads on it.
7325000	7329000	They did put out a release talking about, you know, kind of what's going on.
7330000	7345000	The only thing that isn't going to be released though is the fact that they were working on that kind of total conversion where they were adding the Liberty City map into the Grand Theft Auto 5 map.
7345000	7353000	And of course because that does violate their modding policy now, that unfortunately is not something that they're going to be continuing forward with.
7353000	7355000	But the development of Open 4 will continue though.
7355000	7358000	So that is good to finally get this whole thing resolved.
7358000	7360000	So we've kind of met halfway I guess.
7360000	7361000	Yes.
7361000	7362000	Which is fine.
7362000	7363000	All right.
7363000	7365000	How about Grand Theft Auto 6?
7365000	7367000	Is it time to start talking Grand Theft Auto 6?
7367000	7368000	Not yet, probably.
7368000	7369000	No?
7369000	7371000	I guess we've got to get past Red Dead Redemption 2 first, huh?
7371000	7373000	Before we can talk about that.
7373000	7374000	All right.
7374000	7379000	Well, one more story for you guys tonight, our last official story tonight before we get to the Skype line.
7379000	7385000	There is a brand new rhythm and dance arcade game being released by Konami.
7385000	7386000	That's right.
7386000	7392000	Apparently is being location tested or demoed at a round one in Senashime.
7392000	7394000	I hope I said that right.
7394000	7403000	That is apparently also a location where a lot of dance evolution players, which was, what was that Kinect game that came out that was Konami.
7403000	7405000	It's almost just like that in the arcade.
7405000	7407000	Somebody in the chat will remember.
7407000	7410000	But anyway, Stepstar is the new game.
7411000	7416000	And Stepstar is, it's interesting because the dance pad is like just one big mat.
7416000	7418000	It's almost like one big kind of pad on the ground.
7418000	7420000	It's not split up like DDR was.
7420000	7423000	But in this game, there are four types of notes or steps.
7423000	7428000	There's step, long, jump, and crouch squat down.
7428000	7434000	Because I guess this measures you not just by the dance pad but also by a camera that is watching you.
7434000	7436000	Thank you MXC Dance Masters.
7436000	7437000	I think that was it.
7437000	7439000	That is the name of that game I was thinking of.
7439000	7444000	Anyway, the interesting thing about this game though, it's not a Bamani title.
7444000	7447000	The Bamani logo is not on the flyers.
7447000	7449000	It's not showing up on the cabinet either.
7449000	7452000	So apparently, even though it's a dance game, it's not a Bamani game.
7452000	7457000	So after all these years everybody, confirmed, Bamani is dead.
7457000	7459000	Thank you, goodnight.
7459000	7462000	Alright, I'm just teasing.
7462000	7464000	Put down your pitchforks and torches.
7464000	7466000	Alright, but anyway.
7466000	7467000	I just sighed, that's all.
7467000	7475000	Part of what I think is interesting about this game is that you can actually, I guess the game will actually make a YouTube for you.
7475000	7481000	So you can automatically upload it to YouTube because social sharing is the big thing we do now, right?
7481000	7489000	So the gameplay is recorded and then you can upload it to YouTube via the game's website and a four digit pin that you use.
7489000	7493000	And just so you get a sense of what the songs in the game sound like, you have these guys.
7493000	7498000	This is a cute song.
7498000	7502000	It sounds a little like something out of Hatsune Miku, but I like it.
7502000	7506000	These guys are getting into it too.
7506000	7511000	Alright, anyway, this makes for horrible radio, but that's one of the songs there is in Stepstar on the location test.
7511000	7513000	So there you go.
7513000	7517000	You can check that out if you live in Japan, otherwise you'll have to wait.
7517000	7525000	But the good news is if it's being tested at a round one, maybe it'll make the round ones over here for those of you guys that happen to live near one.
7525000	7528000	Which it seems like there are more and more of those round ones popping up.
7528000	7532000	So that hopefully will be good news for you music game fans.
7532000	7535000	But not Bimani fans because remember, this isn't a Bimani game.
7535000	7536000	Alright.
7536000	7537000	Bimani is dead.
7537000	7539000	Long live Bimani.
7539000	7542000	Alright, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
7542000	7546000	If you want to give us a call, the Skype line is open now.
7546000	7550000	And while we wait for some calls, Loki, I want to check in and see if you have any last minute stories.
7550000	7555000	Well, one thing we didn't talk about this week, which is it's drama, unfortunately.
7555000	7562000	So there is this whole controversy going on around this woman named Alex Mauer.
7562000	7567000	And she was someone that worked on a game called Star Maser.
7567000	7574000	And she's been DMCA copyright claiming a bunch of videos that have Star Maser music in them because...
7574000	7578000	This has been going on for a couple of weeks. Somebody tweeted this at me.
7578000	7581000	Because you know we had those Star Maser guys on the show a while ago.
7581000	7582000	So anyway, sorry.
7582000	7584000	But yeah, this has been going on for a few weeks now.
7584000	7586000	But go ahead. I don't want to cut you off.
7586000	7590000	Anyways, so basically there's a whole...
7590000	7597000	Lawsuit is being filed against her now because she was a contractor and they had it in their contract.
7597000	7601000	I mean, as it is when you're doing contract work, anything you produce in that contract,
7601000	7607000	unless it's specifically stated there, is whoever you're working for, that's their copyright.
7607000	7610000	So you don't own that anymore. But she feels that she does.
7610000	7612000	And so she's claiming against them.
7612000	7619000	And now even other companies like Adult Swim Games, Turner Broadcasting, she filed a claim against them.
7619000	7623000	Like all sorts of crazy shit. And it's just not going to work out too well for her.
7623000	7630000	Here's the thing. This is a really tricky issue and it's one that I don't want to really stick my nose in too far.
7630000	7638000	But I also kind of get, like it sounds like the StarMazer team kind of did a spinoff or like a side game that was...
7638000	7642000	And I forget the name of it or whatever, but apparently some of this stuff was used there too.
7642000	7643000	And so that's...
7643000	7645000	No, it wasn't even that because...
7645000	7646000	That's what it was.
7646000	7650000	No, it's a bunch of stuff. And she felt that she was due some money regarding this.
7650000	7653000	But she doesn't have the rights to this stuff.
7653000	7657000	And now thankfully a lot of the videos are coming back from their claim status on there.
7657000	7660000	Like I said, there is a lawsuit now being filed against her.
7660000	7667000	She's filed death threats, or she's made death threats against people, sent emails, threatened to kill herself.
7667000	7673000	It's just a big, huge mess. It's just... it's bad.
7673000	7675000	But hopefully...
7675000	7677000	They thought that she was getting the help that she needed.
7677000	7679000	I hope that she gets some guidance with that.
7679000	7681000	But she's just kind of doubling down.
7681000	7685000	Going after the users, there's not going to... like the YouTubers and stuff, there's not...
7685000	7687000	If she has an issue with Starbazer, I'm not going to...
7687000	7688000	Well, it wasn't even because...
7688000	7691000	I don't know if she... I don't know all sides of the story.
7691000	7693000	So again, I'm not going to try to stick my nose in it.
7693000	7695000	But if she has a legitimate claim against her...
7695000	7699000	Because at face value, if she was told this is going to be for one game,
7699000	7701000	and then all of a sudden now it's two games,
7701000	7704000	I can sort of see where there is concern.
7704000	7707000	But that's between her and those guys,
7707000	7709000	and they need to work it out with their lives and all this stuff.
7709000	7712000	Dragging all these other fucking people on YouTube and stuff, no winners there.
7712000	7715000	The whole reason she was doing that is because she was trying to get, you know,
7715000	7720000	basically taking it on the YouTubers so that the company gets attention from it.
7720000	7722000	You know, like the YouTubers are supposed to get mad.
7722000	7725000	Well that backfired spectacularly on her, didn't it?
7725000	7726000	It was ridiculous.
7726000	7732000	But at the same time, the psychological stuff that can come with that can really...
7732000	7734000	Like the Internet's a fucking savage place sometimes.
7734000	7736000	Right, and then she basically doesn't own this music,
7736000	7741000	and she's literally sometimes claiming three... making three claims against a channel.
7741000	7743000	That knocks a channel. That's bi. Your channel's gone.
7743000	7745000	Yeah, at that point.
7745000	7748000	But this is also something where, again, I blame YouTube.
7748000	7754000	This is also on YouTube for not being content creator friendly.
7754000	7758000	Yet, it continues to be one of the only options out there.
7758000	7760000	Anyway, this issue's a fucking mess.
7760000	7762000	That's all I have to say.
7762000	7764000	Dungeon Buster's been educated on this issue,
7764000	7767000	so I just want to read this in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
7767000	7768000	Dungeon Buster says,
7768000	7769000	Dungeon Buster says,
7769000	7771000	Star Maser the game is still being made,
7771000	7773000	but there's a spin-off game called Star Maser DSP.
7773000	7774000	That was it.
7774000	7776000	That some backers are upset about because they're asking,
7776000	7778000	why are they working on that instead of the main game?
7778000	7782000	The devs have also been bad at communicating updates to the main project.
7782000	7784000	The last huge update was last November.
7784000	7787000	And then, you know, I have to admit,
7787000	7791000	I really get irked at some of these stories
7791000	7794000	because then I go, well, you know, we had them on our show,
7794000	7796000	and we backed the project and all that stuff,
7796000	7799000	so I really, I'm rooting for them, and I want to see them succeed,
7799000	7802000	but it also kind of doesn't look great on us
7802000	7804000	when we brought on these projects and hyped them up,
7804000	7805000	and they're not...
7805000	7806000	But how are we supposed to know?
7806000	7807000	Yeah, we don't.
7807000	7809000	But it, unfortunately, it also,
7809000	7811000	it just makes me leery of Kickstarters in the future.
7811000	7812000	You know what I mean?
7812000	7813000	Yeah.
7813000	7815000	So it's kind of, I don't know.
7815000	7816000	Anyway, just throwing that out there.
7816000	7819000	Anyway, if anyone from that team happens to be listening,
7819000	7821000	or if this composer happens to be listening,
7821000	7824000	open door, if y'all want to come on the show and talk about it.
7824000	7825000	Open door.
7825000	7826000	Every gamer gets a voice.
7826000	7828000	So, all right.
7828000	7829000	Yeah, and Dutch Ambassador says it's not your fault.
7829000	7830000	There's no way to tell.
7830000	7832000	No, I know that, but at the same time.
7832000	7833000	At the same time, you know.
7833000	7835000	All right, let's go to the phones.
7835000	7836000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
7836000	7837000	Who's this?
7837000	7839000	Hey, this is Raging Nader.
7839000	7840000	Hey, Raging Nader.
7840000	7841000	What's on your mind, buddy?
7841000	7843000	Not a whole lot.
7843000	7850000	This call is semi-related to the email that I sent in last week.
7850000	7851000	Wait a minute.
7851000	7853000	I have to ask a question because you're on video on Skype,
7853000	7854000	and I know this isn't great radio,
7854000	7857000	but are we being projected on a screen behind you?
7857000	7860000	Is that like your computer on a projector?
7860000	7862000	Yeah, yeah.
7862000	7865000	But you watch a lot of movies on Steam and all that stuff,
7865000	7867000	so that makes sense.
7867000	7869000	You might have a projector set up for that.
7869000	7873000	Yeah, well, I play a lot of my DVDs and whatnot,
7873000	7878000	and my projector, and my iTunes content, so on and so forth, so.
7878000	7879000	All right.
7879000	7880000	Sorry, I had to be nosy and ask,
7880000	7882000	but you said you had to follow up to last week's email.
7882000	7883000	Yeah.
7883000	7887000	Now, just to refresh everyone's memory,
7887000	7892000	one thing I brought up was the Super Nintendo Mini,
7892000	7895000	or whatever the official name is,
7895000	7904000	and I gave an anecdote as to my buying the Super Nintendo way back in the day,
7904000	7908000	so on and so forth, and on that note,
7908000	7911000	I want to ask you two related questions.
7911000	7918000	Now, whenever the three of you bought your systems,
7918000	7920000	especially way back in the day,
7920000	7925000	with your limited funds through babysitting or paper routes or whatever,
7925000	7929000	and considering how expensive some of the games could be,
7929000	7932000	especially for 20 years ago or plus,
7933000	7942000	what kind of, for lack of a better term, research did the three of you do,
7942000	7949000	especially considering that they really have the internet as we know it today?
7949000	7950000	Okay.
7950000	7951000	I like this question.
7951000	7955000	So, 20 years ago, what influenced your game buying decisions,
7955000	7959000	because there was no internet, there was no Metacritic.
7959000	7962000	What was it 20 years ago?
7962000	7965000	Well, I'd subscribe to magazines and see what looks nice,
7965000	7969000	and then, of course, 20 years ago, we had the whole video and game rental scene,
7969000	7971000	so we didn't have to make a purchase.
7971000	7973000	You could just rent it and see if it's something you like,
7973000	7975000	or play it at a friend's house.
7975000	7976000	Jamie?
7976000	7980000	It was, oh, I like this in the arcade.
7980000	7981000	Oh, it's coming out.
7981000	7984000	When it was Street Fighter II and Mortal Kombat?
7984000	7985000	Absolutely.
7985000	7987000	Well, and pretty much all I played was RPG and fighting games,
7987000	7990000	and lots and lots and lots of Kirby's Avalanche.
7990000	7994000	Yeah, I would say it's kind of like half what Loki said
7994000	8000000	and half like magazines like GamePro, EGM, and all that.
8000000	8003000	That was kind of what we had instead of the internet then,
8003000	8005000	so that was definitely what went into it.
8005000	8006000	Yeah.
8006000	8014000	At least for me, it's a lot of what you're saying, in my case.
8014000	8019000	I read, for a number of years, I did read Nintendo Power,
8019000	8025000	but I kind of put that, by the way, because I kind of figured,
8025000	8028000	hey, this magazine is put up on Nintendo themselves.
8028000	8031000	This magazine is basically over-glorified ads.
8031000	8035000	Obviously, they're not going to say, hey, our games suck.
8035000	8041000	So I started reading other magazines like GamePro, like you mentioned, and whatnot.
8042000	8045000	Then on top of that, I don't know if you remember,
8045000	8052000	there was a GamePro TV that had a brief run on there.
8052000	8054000	I saw the VOs on there.
8054000	8058000	That's how I discovered Castlevania IV.
8058000	8066000	And then, of course, some other kids in the neighborhood had such-and-such games on such-and-such systems.
8066000	8068000	That's how I checked it out.
8069000	8073000	And that's how I beat a lot of my decisions.
8073000	8079000	Yeah. A lot of times, TV footage and video stuff, like what little did get to TV,
8079000	8083000	was huge influencers on the decision, for sure.
8083000	8084000	Yeah.
8084000	8091000	As for my second question, which kind of relates to my previous question,
8092000	8099000	for the longest time, I personally can say that I was a diehard Nintendo fanboy.
8099000	8105000	You know, I had the original Nintendo, the Super Nintendo,
8105000	8111000	and I even got the N64 in the spring of 1997.
8111000	8119000	And right around the time that I was going to my local Toys R Us to buy the N64,
8119000	8127000	I saw the PlayStation 1 at a demo kiosk with one of those jam packs that they had.
8127000	8134000	Now, I honestly, at the time when Nintendo Fanboy was a little conflicted,
8134000	8137000	because on one hand, I said to myself,
8137000	8142000	wow, these games out there on the jam pack look awesome.
8142000	8148000	I want to play them, you know, but at the same time as being a Nintendo fanboy,
8148000	8153000	I felt almost like, you know, for lack of a better term, traitorous.
8153000	8162000	You know, hey, oh my God, am I actually considered by a competitor's system?
8162000	8168000	Yeah, but that's a lot of ridiculous shit that the advertising campaigns put on our head and all that stuff, you know.
8168000	8177000	Yeah. So that being said, well, ultimately, yeah, I did get the PlayStation 1 a few weeks later,
8177000	8191000	but all that being said, I would like to ask, have you ever had conflicting emotions about buying such a system for similar reasons?
8191000	8195000	No, not me. I'll open this up to the co-host. No, never me.
8195000	8200000	But it was just the reality was I didn't, you know, if I had had the money, I would have bought them all.
8200000	8204000	But I never had that kind of money, so you had to make a choice.
8204000	8211000	And usually those choices were heavily influenced by, you know, what did my friends have and, you know, what was available in that regard.
8211000	8220000	But I, no, no, I really wouldn't buy stuff out of loyalty. Shit, I wish at a young age I'd been able to afford a Neo Geo.
8220000	8228000	I remember renting a Neo Geo. You could rent the whole damn system in like a game or two for like 15 bucks for a few days.
8228000	8233000	And I remember renting Fatal Fury Special so I could play that on Neo Geo.
8233000	8238000	Because, yeah, oh man, that was, I was like, I was like, I had the fucking arcade in my house. It was awesome.
8238000	8240000	We might be selling ours.
8240000	8241000	Really?
8241000	8245000	Yep. We haven't played it a whole lot and that'd give us a few grand.
8245000	8248000	No, yeah, I guess so. I guess, yeah, those things are worth a lot.
8248000	8250000	So, all right.
8250000	8251000	Yeah.
8251000	8254000	Rage Nator, I'm gonna let you go so we can try to squeeze some more calls, but good questions tonight. Take care, buddy.
8254000	8255000	Sure.
8255000	8256000	All right.
8256000	8257000	All right, have a nice night.
8257000	8258000	Bye.
8258000	8264000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype. If you want to give us a call, we'll leave it open for just a couple more minutes here.
8264000	8270000	But if you are on the fence on if you should call or not, you should probably call right now because we might close it up soon.
8270000	8274000	Let me check in with Loki. Any other last minute stories that we have?
8274000	8278000	No, not really.
8278000	8279000	Well, gee.
8279000	8280000	All right.
8280000	8282000	Sorry.
8282000	8284000	What do you want? I mean.
8284000	8289000	Yeah, I know. I know. Well, I'm just trying to buy some time. We wait for another call here.
8289000	8293000	Any games y'all are planning to play this week?
8293000	8295000	Fives of 12 for me.
8295000	8302000	I'm still working on actually starting programming this game.
8302000	8306000	But it's not for, you know, it hasn't been completely a waste of time.
8306000	8312000	So I like I've been gathering other things. I've been trying to figure out like the storyline or whatever for the game.
8312000	8319000	I'm going to be working on and also finding music and that they're like stylistic assets and stuff that I kind of want to base.
8319000	8325000	You know, like kind of like I guess like a board, if you will, of like, OK, I kind of like the way this looks.
8325000	8328000	I want to kind of use as like an inspiration board.
8328000	8333000	There you go. And so, yeah, we just kind of do that stuff.
8333000	8335000	What about you, Jimmy?
8335000	8341000	I I actually finished up writing. I was considering starting my book.
8341000	8347000	Oh, I've been world building so much. I might just get it going. But talking shit, naming names by Jamie.
8347000	8354000	No. But other than that, I'm I still got Ultra Despair Girls to get started on.
8354000	8358000	And I've been enjoying Xenoverse two so much. I don't really want to play anything else.
8358000	8362000	All right. Well, the phone lines look like they're slowing down.
8362000	8368000	So I think that means it's time to close them up. But thank you, guys, who did call in.
8368000	8372000	Thanks, Regenator. Thanks for the emails, of course, and all the chat comments tonight.
8372000	8377000	If you think of something after the fact, you can always give us a shout on Twitter at OLR.
8377000	8380000	You can leave us a comment over at VOG Network dot com or talk to us throughout the week,
8380000	8385000	either in our IRC channel at VOG Network or on the new Discord.
8385000	8390000	Either way would be fantastic. But I think it is that part of the show where we're going to wrap things up.
8390000	8393000	So I want to thank you guys, as always, for listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
8393000	8395000	And if you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio,
8395000	8401000	please remember to leave a five star review where you found this show either on iTunes or Google Play.
8401000	8406000	And of course, we also say tell a friend about the show. Help us spread the word where every gamer has a voice.
8406000	8411000	We got to have all the gamer voices here to air them. So word of mouth goes a very, very, very long way.
8411000	8416000	We always appreciate it. So I guess we will close it up tonight by getting everybody's final thoughts.
8416000	8421000	Loki, your final thought tonight. So I was looking in chat and they were talking about the Oton.
8421000	8426000	I haven't even figured. I didn't remember if they even launched the campaign for that,
8426000	8430000	because I know that dude was talking about the Oton for like the longest time.
8430000	8437000	And they were like bouncing between like Kickstarter and Indie.
8437000	8442000	Was it IndieGoGo or whatever it was? I don't remember. But like.
8442000	8447000	Yeah, that was a shit show. There was no way that was going to happen.
8447000	8453000	That's it. And Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight. I wish I had a quesadilla.
8453000	8459000	Mmm. Cheese and tortillas. I just want the cheese, really. It's the melted cheese that's the best part.
8459000	8463000	The tortilla is just a vehicle for deliverance of said cheese.
8463000	8470000	And that reminds me, I did see, was it that the tease video that Oton Brown's bringing good eats back, which is fantastic.
8470000	8475000	OK. How about unwrapped with Mark Summers? That was my favorite. No.
8475000	8479000	Yeah, I'd go for that. All right. All right.
8479000	8482000	That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
8482000	8486000	My final thought tonight would be I want to get to my coloring book this week.
8486000	8489000	I saw my Golden Girls coloring book. I need to get to this week. Your pencils arrived at my house.
8489000	8493000	Yeah. I forgot to bring them. All right. That's OK. That means you have to come over.
8493000	8498000	Well, isn't it a nice thing that I have to go drop you off anyway? So that's right.
8498000	8502000	OK. There we go. All right. So that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
8502000	8505000	Have a great night, everybody. We'll see you next time. Bye.
8528000	8535000	Radio or Vogue Network, but you know, they were all still true.
8535000	8538000	See you next week.
8558000	8560000	You
