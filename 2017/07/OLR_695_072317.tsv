0	17160	This week, the next era of video games and non-interactive media is here on the heels
17160	21120	of a critically successful and renewed Castlevania series comes announcements of additional series,
21120	22120	movies and more.
22120	24700	Tonight, the next episode of Orange Island Radio is here, chock full of the week's gaming
24700	31700	news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
31700	35100	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
35100	36780	where every gamer has a voice.
36780	39780	It is Orange Lounge Radio.
39780	46500	Live tonight, episode number 695 for this July the 23rd of 2017.
46500	51420	We of course are three folks here based out of Sacramento, California to talk about video
51420	53580	games, gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle.
53580	54920	I am Rob Roberts.
54920	55920	She is DarkSakura.
55920	56920	Hi.
56920	57920	Hi.
57920	58920	How are you?
58920	59920	I'm okay.
59920	62500	So this is the last Sunday with Das Boot on your foot, right?
62500	63500	Yes.
63500	67700	So I'm going to decorate it with stars on Tuesday so that when they cut it off, it'll
67700	70500	be sparkly and my foot will be free.
70500	73800	And what's going to happen is I'm going for a pedicure.
73800	77660	Right when it's done, right after my doctor's appointment, I'm going to have a pedicure.
77660	79440	I don't care how gross my foot is.
79440	83180	As a lady should treat herself once in a while or a gentleman actually.
83180	84180	I had a pedicure once.
84180	86180	I was like, my toenails never looked better.
86180	88860	Well, it's really relaxing though to have someone scrub your feet.
88860	90820	Well, also there's that chair that.
90820	91820	Right.
91820	92820	Yeah.
92820	99500	And the other thing too is that I like that it's, well, the tips of my toes are actually
99500	101900	because I haven't been able to wear anything over my toes.
101900	105600	So the tips of my toes are actually really kind of scuffed up.
105600	107780	So it'll be nice to have like human feet again.
107780	112900	I'm kind of surprised no one has thought of a way to sell like bro-dicures or like target
112900	114660	men in that market somehow.
114660	115660	Like that.
115660	116660	Just call it metricures.
116660	120660	Look, I'm all for, you know, screw your gender norms and all that stuff.
120660	125220	But I understand the reality is most men view it as a girly thing.
125220	128220	But like, what if, what if like you fragile masculine?
128220	129220	I know.
129220	130220	I know.
130220	131220	I know.
131220	132220	Look, that's a whole nother issue.
132220	133220	But the reality is the society we live in.
133220	134220	Right.
134220	138060	So I mean, could, could there be a thing where like you could go like play games, video,
138060	141160	you're like playing Xbox while getting your feet scrubbed?
141160	142160	I don't know.
142160	143160	Yes.
143160	145160	Well, having, you know, a pedicure.
145160	148080	So how many people do text messages when they do it?
148080	149080	Right.
149080	150080	I don't know.
150080	151080	I could just do Pokemon go.
151080	152080	Like I'm doing right now.
152080	153080	All right.
153080	154540	I'm trying to get to level 29.
154540	155540	Tech master.
155540	156540	Loki is here.
156540	157540	Loki, would you get a bro-dicure?
157540	158540	No, no.
158540	159540	Why not?
159540	160540	It's expensive.
160540	166560	I accidentally, I accidentally wandered into like during like jury duty one year, I wandered
166560	174460	into a barbershop that was like a, a men's spa cause me like 40 bucks for a fucking
174460	175460	haircut.
175460	176460	So no thank you.
176460	184240	I just said the only men's spas I know ever the hookup joints, like an upscale, like get
184240	189480	your hair cut, get, you know, your, you know, face shade and stuff like fuck that.
189480	192520	I can just go to the bowling alley that has a barbershop in there and they'll charge you
192520	195360	like $20 for that.
195640	199600	Just as a rule of thumb, Loki, if a men's club is offering a steam room and they're
199600	202840	charging you 40 bucks to get in there, Loki, I don't think it's your cup of tea.
202840	205200	You don't want to go in there.
205200	206200	Duly noted.
206200	207280	All right.
207280	208360	Just a public service.
208360	213400	The advertisements are going to be pretty obvious what, Hey, you never know.
213400	214400	All right.
214400	215400	Going to our chat.
215400	216400	We do tape live.
216400	219120	Of course, believe it or not, it's a video game show and we do tape live every Sunday
219120	223280	night at the voice of geeks network vog network.com six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern
223320	227040	right after the Bobby black Wolf show, although not tonight, he's going through the whole
227040	228040	home transition.
228040	229480	He's talked about on his show.
229480	232280	So he wasn't able to join us tonight, but usually he's there and you can of course check
232280	236280	out his podcast feed or the podcast feed of many of the great shows that we share the
236280	237280	network with.
237280	240320	Like as far as gaming shows go, we have girls gone, wow.
240320	242040	Game buoy electric sisterhood.
242040	246000	And that's just, that's just some of many shows that we have that are great at the voice
246000	247000	of geeks network.
247000	248200	So check that out.
248200	253720	Going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, uh, JD and chat says gender is a construct
253720	254720	tear it apart.
254720	255720	Yes.
255720	256720	There you go.
256720	257720	There you go.
257720	258720	Darcy.
258720	259720	Oh, it's not just tearing it apart.
259720	260720	It's disintegration time.
260720	263200	Um, let's see, which was also a great album by the cure.
263200	269800	Speaking of defying gender norms, that was disintegration.
269800	270800	It wasn't disintegration time.
270800	274000	It was, I thought that was an album was disintegration in time.
274000	275800	Oh, I'll look it up now.
275800	276800	All right.
277400	278920	What are you thinking of fascination street?
278920	279920	Am I, I don't know.
279920	284440	Anyway, I'm also looking at an SSG100 Matt who says I had a pedicure once also my toenails
284440	285680	were never cut so well.
285680	286680	Yeah.
286680	287740	It just happens sometimes.
287740	289800	It was just called disintegration.
289800	291400	Athletes get pedicures all the time.
291400	294040	It's better on their feet to have someone work on them regularly.
294040	299120	And yeah, I think, um, certain types of diabetics have to get kind of pro feet treatment.
299120	301360	Also I am too ticklish for any of that.
301360	302360	Are you really?
302360	303360	Yeah, I can't.
303360	306360	That's kind of cute in an awkward way.
306920	308200	So the album was disintegration.
308200	309760	I know my cure albums.
309760	312360	Well I do too, but I knew I had my phase in high school.
312360	314760	I had said disintegration time and that wasn't it.
314760	315760	All right.
315760	316760	Fair enough.
316760	317760	All right.
317760	319560	So anyway, uh, we want to get to the kickoff topic tonight.
319560	320760	Look, it is a video game show.
320760	324440	I want to get to video games because we actually, we have a little bit of a cameo tonight.
324440	326160	I'm going to talk about that in a minute.
326160	327960	And yes, we'll talk about Comic-Con as well.
327960	332040	I know some of y'all are at Comic-Con so there was a few festivals going on this weekend.
332040	336840	So one of them was the Pokemon go festival that was happening in Chicago.
336840	342040	The very first time Niantic was doing an event live based on Pokemon go, but not the first
342040	343040	live Niantic event.
343040	348100	In fact, I feel like maybe I need to get a shirt made that says I survived a successful
348100	349360	Niantic event in Chicago.
349360	352400	You might be confused that this isn't their first event, but yeah.
352400	353400	All right.
353400	357880	Loki from the media perspective, from the news, what's been going on, what's being reported
357880	359400	on out there in the bloggy world.
359400	362400	It was a fucking shit show.
362400	365480	Is that the, is that the official Tom Brokaw line?
365480	367120	Yeah, basically.
367120	371640	So they had problems with it being very unplayable.
371640	378200	Apparently they did not have enough server space available for the players in the area
378200	384080	and it caused them not to be able to catch different Pokemon that were in there or to
384080	390480	battle some of these, you know, legendary Pokemon that they had.
390480	393160	So it was just, it was bad.
393160	397520	I mean, people were chanting, you know, fix the game, you know, that type of stuff.
397520	402600	So did you watch any of the feed on Twitch as it was going on?
402600	407160	I had logged into that like early and they hadn't actually shown anything yet.
407160	410840	And I was like, fuck, this ain't sitting here all day to watch this shit.
410840	411840	Yeah.
411880	416000	It was weird to me how the live stream was on and off, like it was like they would show
416000	419040	something for 10 minutes and then they'd be like, we're just going to show this static
419040	423520	image and you can hear the noises of the festival, but you can't see anything.
423520	427160	Now I had, I probably can't stream it with all the bandwidth.
427160	431960	I guess, I guess now I had always planned on Saturday because they did this whole thing
431960	436200	where they were like, okay, the people at Grant Park are going to be catching Pokemon
436200	441320	and the types of Pokemon that they catch are going to drive these bonuses.
441360	445560	And if everybody else in the world can catch a ton of Pokemon, although they never gave
445560	449240	numbers, if every everybody in the world catches these Pokemon, we're going to roll out these
449240	454280	bonuses for 24, 48 hours and who knows a mystery challenge, which we all fucking know was going
454280	455960	to be legendaries, right?
455960	461280	So I had always planned to go out with a pal downtown and we were going to go catch Pokemon.
461280	466760	And honestly, Saturday when we were out doing Pokemon during the measurement windows of
466760	472200	the event, which was our time, 9 AM to 9 30, then it was like 11, 11 31 to one 30.
472200	474280	So we went to, we didn't really know where to go.
474280	476120	So we were like, let's just go to the Capitol.
476120	479560	Cause that's a really crowded area and it has a ton of pokey stops, right?
479560	483640	So we went down there and there was, there was like a lot of people there playing the
483640	484640	game.
484640	490220	And for all those people that are like, Pokemon go is dead, which I'm sorry, but if you go
490220	494760	to a news site and they're running a headline that says Pokemon go is dead and I'm not going
494760	495760	to name names.
495760	496760	Okay.
496760	497760	I will.
497760	498760	It's Forbes.
498760	500800	But if you're going to go to a site like that, that runs those types of headlines, like you
500800	506800	need to be skeptical about how much this website, um, how would you say it?
506800	507800	Games exaggerates.
507800	512120	I think the gamers that like to exaggerate, when you're looking for your video game news,
512120	515640	do you think first, man, I got to go to Forbes and see what they've had with that.
515640	519600	Well, but Forbes is great at writing real fucking clickbait headlines and I'm, I'm in
519600	524680	a mood today, so I'm calling people out this week and I'm starting with Forbes because
524680	525680	I'm sick.
525680	526680	Yes.
526680	527680	Let the hatred fill.
527680	529820	No, I'm just, I'm fucking sick at the clickbait on that website.
529820	531600	It's not as bad as Motley fool.
531600	533180	That's the fucking worst.
533180	539080	But Forbes has some of the most clickbaity Nintendo hate boner things that they published
539080	541420	just to get Nintendo fans to click on their website.
541420	543200	So I'm just, I'm calling it like it is tonight.
543200	544360	I don't care.
544360	551940	So anyway, so if I see another Forbes article with a link that says Pokemon go is dead,
551940	554740	my eyes are going to roll so far back in my head, I can see my brain.
554740	557260	My point is people are still playing this game.
557260	562460	Is it as many as we're playing it when we had this cultural event back in July of last
562460	563460	year?
563460	568100	No, but is it pretty strong right now, especially compared to maybe three months ago when there
568100	569900	was, you know, not as much going on.
569900	570900	Yeah.
570900	571900	Yeah.
571900	574940	I mean, I think there's a lot of mobile games out there that would love to have what Niantic
574940	575940	has.
575940	576940	Right.
577740	582140	You know, from that perspective of what we were doing downtown, like it was actually
582140	583140	a lot of fun.
583140	587920	The game was running mostly fine except for the fact that the game has a tendency to crash
587920	592780	a lot on my iPhone, which is, I don't know if that's an Niantic issue or a phone issue
592780	593780	or like a phone issue.
593780	594780	I don't know.
594780	598040	Cause my other friends, like it crashes a lot.
598040	599720	Even an Allen, Allen has Android.
599720	603580	I have, I don't play it long enough for the crash maybe, or you don't use the Pogo plus,
603580	604580	which could be one of it.
604580	605580	I don't know.
606220	611340	But anyway, my point is, is that yes, there are still quite a few people playing the game,
611340	612340	right?
612340	614400	So of course there was a great interest in this event.
614400	615780	It sold out very quickly.
615780	619040	They had 20,000 people, some odd that were going to this event.
619040	622940	And so to hear that it turned out like, Oh, I don't know that fire festival that happened
622940	626140	in the Bahamas in some ways was, was pretty disappointing.
626140	629580	At least so unlike that fire festival, they got their money back.
629580	631700	Well, they also weren't trapped on a desert island.
631700	632700	Right.
632700	634420	So, I mean, there's that to be thankful for.
634460	638500	So anyway, here's my thing I could sit here and continue to theorize, well, based on what
638500	641300	I saw or based on what did, this is what must be happening at the festival.
641300	646100	Then I was like, wait a minute, Rob, wait a minute, Rob, you idiot, you know, somebody
646100	649580	that went to Chicago Pokemon go Fest.
649580	653720	Why don't you invite him on the show to talk about what it was really like at Pokemon go
653720	654720	Fest?
654720	659300	Cause you know, there's all this stuff in these publications that tend to games, exaggerate
659300	662860	things or focus on just the worst of it.
663620	665740	There may be some good that went with the bad.
665740	671820	So I reached out to my buddy Charles, also known as rock god of podcast or rock god of
671820	673080	pod on Twitter.
673080	677420	He is one of the hosts of the Pokemon go podcast, which is a show I plugged here a couple weeks
677420	679780	ago cause they were good enough to have me on it.
679780	684540	So I reached out to Charles, unfortunately he had another paying gig tonight so he could
684540	686440	not be here on the show live.
686440	688120	So we had to kind of work real fast.
688120	695560	He sent us a really lengthy audio clip explaining like his time at the festival.
695560	699080	Unfortunately I wanted to scale it back a little bit cause it was, you know, it is only
699080	700080	a three hour show here.
700080	701360	So I wanted to scale it back a little bit.
701360	705760	So I kind of cut out some of these parts that I want you guys to hear here.
705760	710600	So let's check in with, Oh, but if the audio is a little weird, it's because I edited it
710600	711700	like an hour ago.
711700	714540	So if there's any sloppiness, it's on my part.
714540	717360	So I apologize to Charles and to listeners for that.
717520	721720	Let's check in with Charles and check and see how his day kind of started over there
721720	722720	in Chicago.
722720	726680	Hey Rob, Jamie and Loki at Orange Lounge Radio.
726680	731200	It's the rock out of podcasting Charles Mcfall from Pokemon Go podcast.
731200	734640	And let me tell you what it was really like being there at Pokemon Go Fest.
734640	740800	Now line started at 6 AM and there were people out there, I'm sure at 6 AM, lined up.
740800	745240	Myself and the people I was traveling with, we walked from the hood that was about two
745240	747000	blocks away from the park.
747000	753240	And so we were walking down and as we came up on the park, there's this massive line
753240	756600	stretched out and we're like, Oh crap.
756600	759500	Because a lot of people, we had somebody standing in line for us for the early entry.
759500	765140	We did have early entry badges, which were supposed to get you in starting at 9 AM.
765140	768200	The general public started at 10 AM.
768200	772900	And the line, basically the short version is, that line was not for early entry.
772900	777000	That was for the regular entry people and it was already super long.
777000	784180	We got in, say 9.30, it took us about 30-ish minutes to make it around the fence and into
784180	785180	the entranceway.
785180	788740	And they were checking bags in, but it was honestly, they weren't checking them that
788740	789740	much.
789740	790740	They were just kind of moving people through.
790740	796740	Got in and everybody, we're all hyped, everybody's excited and you get this envelope, as you
796740	800940	walk in the door, you're handed an envelope and it has a real world patch that is the
800940	806600	exact same thing that you get in the game that's the medal in the game for being there
806600	808460	is a patch version of the medal.
808460	813500	And on the other side is a QR code and you had to go to any stop inside the park that
813500	819700	had a lot of temporary cool stops, which, and gyms, which tells us they can absolutely
819700	826100	do the stop slash gym for pay idea that we've been talking about on our show forever.
826100	829700	Anyway, and right down the middle as you come in is all the concessions and everything.
829700	834940	It was really actually, I'm going to say from a functional human being standpoint,
834940	837100	they did an amazing job setting this up.
837100	841720	It was easy to find the food, they had water stations, they had at least two if not three
841720	844900	water stations around to get you free water.
844900	848700	So you brought your own bottle, you can bring in two bottles of water sealed or empty pouches
848700	853140	or, and they actually didn't really think that strict about it.
853140	859260	The price is, I expected eight to ten dollars per person to eat and I'm talking about, you
859300	863820	know, you go to a festival and you're talking about, hey, pizza, pizza is ten bucks, water
863820	871300	is five dollars, don't you, no, my pizza, my honest to God, real Chicago restaurant,
871300	874620	you know, they made it in the restaurant and brought it to the park very quickly.
874620	877140	It was still hot when it got there.
877140	883180	Real Chicago slice pizza, now hold up my fingers like you can see me, but a big huge triangle,
883180	886500	five bucks, five bucks, a bottle of water was like two dollars.
886500	888860	It was insanely cheap to be there.
888860	890060	That was really cool.
890060	894220	Let me jump, let me, let me jump in here for a minute to talk about some of what Charles
894220	895740	said there.
895740	898380	And obviously, sorry about some of the audio there.
898380	902200	There's some tearing effects in audio and the audio that we got sent.
902200	906760	But my understanding is that Charles like actually recorded that in a car in a parking
906760	908680	lot on the way to one of his gigs.
908680	911800	So really appreciate him taking the time out to do that.
911800	915720	But some of the audio was a little shaky, I didn't have time to clean it, clean it up.
916520	919260	On that note, I noticed there was some bad and there was some good in there.
919260	920600	So it sounds like Charles was fortunate.
920600	922780	He had this early entry thing and a buddy.
922780	924860	So he got into this thing early.
924860	928720	But there was this huge line, you guys all saw this on the media and some of the Twitter,
928720	929720	right?
929720	934960	There was this huge line, sorry, this huge line going around the whole place that was
934960	937040	it was hard for people to get in and stuff, right?
937040	940960	So I mean, it was taking like forever for people to get into this place.
940960	944400	And what blew my mind about it is that it sounded like from what Charles is saying there,
944400	945520	they really weren't doing much.
945520	949480	They weren't really like scanning the bags that deeply or whatever.
949480	950600	So what was taking so long?
950600	952400	And here's the other thing.
952400	955900	So now comparing Charles's experience to my experience a little bit when I went to Niantic's
955900	960520	Ingress anomaly over Veterans Day weekend last year when I missed the show.
960520	961520	That's where I was at.
961520	963600	I was at a Niantic event in Chicago.
963600	969240	They did check ins the night before for the Ingress event, you were able to go to a bar
969240	974320	that was in the downtown area and you could check in at the bar the night before and get
974320	975320	your stuff.
975320	977200	And then, you know, we all went to the anomaly.
977200	982000	Now granted, I understand there was maybe 1,500 people that did the Ingress event compared
982000	983320	to what, 20,000.
983320	985320	So I obviously understand the size.
985320	988560	Which I think would be all the more reason they have to check in the night before.
988560	992120	That's what blew my mind is I was like, why didn't they do check ins the night before?
992120	996320	Were they that concerned about resales, spoofers?
996320	1000600	I don't know what it was, but it really blew my mind that like for this smaller event Niantic
1000600	1004240	did something, but then for this larger event they didn't.
1004240	1007800	But then Charles does point out there is some good stuff that you're not hearing about in
1007800	1008800	these news stories.
1008800	1013480	It sounds like from a functional standpoint, you know, the vendors were reasonable and
1013480	1016560	they weren't trying to price gouge people or any of that stuff.
1016560	1021320	And that, you know, as far as like a, am I going to get food and water situation?
1021320	1022320	It was fine.
1022320	1025600	Unlike, you know, even though we're joking about Fire Festival, those people that were
1025600	1029180	trapped in the Bahamas were having a food and water situation as well, which is a lot
1029180	1030180	more serious.
1030220	1035540	But it sounds like that was never an issue with the Pokemon Go Fest and that that was
1035540	1036720	doing very well.
1036720	1039140	So let me continue on with another clip from Charles.
1039140	1044540	And so we get over this all at 930 in the morning and we get over there and I'm spending
1044540	1047100	some stuff and the game starts kind of getting clunky.
1047100	1051060	I'm trying to go into a raid and I'm like, well, I'm going to fight this Pikachu raid.
1051060	1053820	Raid battles were free all day long.
1053820	1056020	Did not take any passes at all.
1056020	1060220	Raid battles inside the park, 100% free.
1060220	1061220	And they were doing them.
1061220	1066500	They would be a 10 minute warning time, like a regular start in 10 minutes and then pop
1066500	1069580	into 14 minute uptime.
1069580	1071700	And they had gyms.
1071700	1074260	I think they had eight gyms in there.
1074260	1078340	So there's plenty of places for people to play and get to.
1078340	1081900	And I started to do the Pikachu raid and I hit the thing and put me in a room and it
1081900	1085180	kind of locked and didn't do anything and the game crashed.
1085180	1087460	And somebody else was like, I can't get the QR code work.
1087460	1091060	They were having issues and they finally got theirs to work.
1091060	1092980	And that's at 930 in the morning.
1092980	1098880	So already it's like, hmm, at 10 o'clock, I don't know when they actually started the
1098880	1100860	actual public coming in.
1100860	1104760	They had a big enough gate that you could funnel both lines in easily.
1104760	1109900	But the thing is that nine o'clock early band, they gave out way too many of those bands
1109900	1117820	because at 1030, almost 11 on the backside of the park, I mean, the line would be super,
1117820	1118820	super long.
1118820	1123220	People were still there and we didn't go up and ask, are you in the early entry line?
1123220	1129860	But this is, this is at 11 o'clock almost, no, it is about 1030, I guess it's about 1030.
1129860	1133940	And the early entry quotey fingers people seem to be still lined up and trying to come
1133940	1135300	in.
1135300	1139020	I've heard that it took three hours of standing in line.
1139140	1144980	I'm not talking about the early guy here at 6 a.m. people from the time 10 o'clock hit,
1144980	1150300	it took three hours to get through the general public line and get into the park.
1150300	1152940	But that's, that was frustrating for a lot of people.
1152940	1155700	And I was tweeting that we had some friends who did not get early passes that were in
1155700	1159380	the general and they were tweeting, they spoke among their radio.
1159380	1163460	And we're telling them, you're not missing anything, we can't play, nothing's connecting
1163460	1164460	here.
1164900	1168220	1030, 11, maybe it's closer to 11.
1168220	1171580	They said, all right, everybody come to the main stage, we're gonna kick this thing off.
1171580	1174660	And I'm looking around the house like, there's only maybe a thousand people in the park right
1174660	1175660	now.
1175660	1176660	Maybe two.
1176660	1177660	I mean, it's always a huge open space.
1177660	1181660	It's hard to kind of gauge how many people are in, but like, of the 20,000 people supposed
1181660	1185100	to be here, you haven't gotten very many in the park yet.
1185100	1190100	What's interesting about that is that watching the live feed, I would not have guessed that
1190100	1192140	they had not filled the park yet.
1192140	1196380	In fact, my thought was, I'm hearing all this stuff on Twitter about all these people stuck
1196380	1198260	in line, which Charles talks about there.
1198260	1203500	Can you imagine you travel from California, and some people came further, you travel from
1203500	1208220	California to Chicago to go to the first Pokemon Go event only to stand in line for three hours
1208220	1212980	and know that you're missing the first event inside the park, even though punchline, no
1212980	1217140	one in the park can play either, but the people outside may not actually know that.
1217140	1219860	So can you imagine how frustrated like people are gonna be at this event?
1219860	1223820	And this is why things started to get ugly, which we're gonna hear about in a little bit.
1223820	1229180	But with the whole, you know, what Charles is talking about with the lines and everything,
1229180	1235380	I mean, again, I'm blown away that Niantic did not have line management for 20,000 people,
1235380	1240260	and then it took three hours for people to get into this event, which was part of the
1240260	1241920	ugliness to begin with, right?
1241920	1245780	So again, why didn't they do check-ins the day before for some people, and why didn't
1245780	1248700	they have more staff, more points of entry?
1248700	1250340	It should be simple math, right?
1250340	1252340	How long it's gonna take one person to process...
1252340	1254340	They know how many tickets they sold.
1254340	1258420	Well, yeah, they know exactly how many tickets they sold, and so they should know how long
1258420	1260180	it's gonna take to process those people.
1260180	1261180	That blows me away.
1261180	1265220	I mean, I know a lot of anime conventions and stuff have long waits sometimes, but,
1265220	1267180	you know, again, a lot of rookie mistakes.
1267180	1268580	Cough Cough Anime Expo.
1268580	1272700	Well, a lot of rookie mistakes sometimes with this stuff.
1272700	1279100	I remember Square Enix's first Final Fantasy Fan Fest in 2014 was a huge problem because
1279100	1283840	they had a printer break, and they didn't have a backup printer.
1283840	1287300	So all those people had to wait while somebody, like, ran to Office Depot to get a printer
1287300	1288300	or something like that.
1288300	1289380	It was crazy.
1289380	1294100	So anyway, I don't know if there was more stuff like that at Pokemon Go Fest or what.
1294100	1299100	Anyway, I did cut some stuff here about, Charles was talking about some of the, like, shirts
1299100	1302760	and things they were selling in the park were not a great quality.
1302760	1306420	Like they just weren't even selling Team Valor or anything.
1306420	1310060	Apparently the bootleggers outside, because you know there's always bootleggers, bootleggers
1310060	1313140	had better stuff from what Charles was saying.
1313140	1317020	But I want to get to this next clip because Charles says something here that I think is
1317020	1321500	really damning for the whole excuse Niantic is giving us.
1321500	1322500	So listen up.
1322500	1328100	If people start chanting, we can't log in, we can't connect, or something like that.
1328100	1330140	I forget what the chant was.
1330140	1333900	But they're yelling at her, and she's ignoring it, and the first person she introduced is
1333900	1334900	John Hanke.
1334900	1335900	And people are, boo!
1335900	1341460	They're like, no, no, we understand, things are, you know, we're working on it.
1341460	1346980	He handled it well, but I mean there was somebody so loud up front yelling at him that was coming
1346980	1350700	through the microphone a little bit and back out to the PA so we could kind of hear it.
1350700	1355740	And he handled it like a pro, I mean he took his punches, but they were like, you know,
1355740	1356740	but he did.
1356740	1358580	And that was a major mistake to me.
1358580	1364260	Oh no, we're contacting the cell places, and I'm going, in my mind, I'm going, okay, and
1364260	1367860	actually I said this to the people around me, here's the bottom line on the cell service,
1367860	1374380	you'll hear all kinds of rumors about contract obligations, blah, blah, bullshit.
1374380	1381740	Here's the thing, now in the real world there are absolutely coverage areas, right?
1381740	1386700	So some parts of the park had much better service with Verizon than in other parts of
1386740	1387740	the park.
1387740	1391300	But that was true for AT&T, you know, it all kind of covered a little differently.
1391300	1396140	But here was the thing, even at that point, there's maybe, like I said, maybe 2,000 people
1396140	1402860	at the most, which would not overload any cell tower anywhere.
1402860	1407340	And they're like, yeah, we're working with them, you can see that, notice your servers,
1407340	1411740	because I can livestream, which I did, I did some livestreams right there from the park,
1411740	1416580	I can Twitter, I can get my messages, I can get on Discord, I can open up another game
1416580	1422020	and play it, I can do all kinds of stuff on my phone that touches the internet, but
1422020	1424540	I cannot play your game.
1424540	1430820	I can Twitter, I can Discord, I can livestream, do you know how much bandwidth it takes to
1430820	1434020	livestream but I can't play your game?
1434020	1441260	And you're going to go blame the cell towers as the issue, but I can livestream, huh, isn't
1441260	1442260	that funny?
1442460	1448100	Maybe if he wasn't livestreaming, they'd have enough bandwidth for the game.
1448100	1451300	Damn it, Charles, you broke the whole damn thing.
1451300	1453300	You single-handedly broke Go Fest with your livestream.
1453300	1457220	No, I'm not surprised that their servers are crap.
1457220	1461020	But I mean, and I think Charles brings this up, and I think it's in something that I cut
1461020	1465560	out, but he brings up that, you know, Dragon Con, 80,000 people, people play this game
1465560	1469180	at Disneyland every day, they don't have problems.
1469180	1473180	It was something about what they were doing with this event and the restrictions they
1473180	1478460	were putting on this event, some of the graphical issues of the game, and just the poor optimization
1478460	1483560	I guess all around of the game, really, in some ways, it kind of all contributed to this.
1483560	1489020	But to blame the cell networks when people are able to be on Twitter, livestream, tell
1489020	1492700	the rest of the internet what a shitty time they're having, that's a little disingenuous.
1492700	1497980	Yeah, I can understand if they couldn't, if internet access was a problem, that would
1497980	1502740	make more sense, but that's not the case, especially when it's only your game, that's
1502740	1503820	not working.
1503820	1507100	So here was the first thing I thought of, the first thing I thought of when I heard
1507100	1512780	all of this was going down yesterday was, why didn't they just have Wi-Fi?
1512780	1518220	And granted, 20,000 people is probably a lot to have on Wi-Fi, but they do it at airports
1518220	1523500	somehow, and you know, I'm sure at least even if they, let's say they could only get, maybe
1523500	1527720	the VIP people that got in early also got the Wi-Fi, I don't know.
1527720	1533320	So maybe 2,000 people get on Wi-Fi, well that's still 10% off the rest of this if you're
1533320	1537180	going to blame the networks, which I'm not so sure, obviously based off the livestreaming
1537180	1538440	comment that it really is.
1538440	1541440	But still, I think that question, why wasn't there Wi-Fi?
1541440	1543240	Well, Charles has an answer.
1543240	1548040	They did not have the Wi-Fi as promised, but there was, I heard, again, these are quote
1548040	1552480	rumors, they didn't announce this, but I heard that because of the massive rainstorms that
1552480	1556640	came through on Friday, and there were massive rainstorms on Friday, I guess so, a little
1556680	1561040	bit Friday night, they weren't able to set up the Wi-Fi stuff, and it was even raining
1561040	1565760	a little bit Saturday morning, but then the sun came out by 9 o'clock and it was gorgeous
1565760	1567240	all day.
1567240	1573040	Anyway, so they did the hunt, and most people can't do it, so then they call everybody back
1573040	1581040	to the stage, and now it's worse, people are booing and yelling, and finally she just stopped
1581240	1586640	talking and just left the stage, that was it, she basically got booed off the stage.
1586640	1590520	And so we started milling around, so the rest of the day is much shorter than that first
1590520	1595920	part of the story, the rest of the day, things got better, I ended up, I couldn't play at
1595920	1601720	all until, I mean, like I said, I was there at 9.30, couldn't play at all until 12.30,
1601720	1604640	and the only way I could play there, I call it the filthy casual mode, right, you just
1604640	1610640	turn on your plus, or for me the gotcha, which is even more filthy casual, because it's automatic,
1610640	1613200	and that's it, you don't play the game, you just let it run in the background and see
1613200	1615440	what it spins, what it catches.
1615440	1619440	That became the only way for me to play, I could get my game to come up just long enough
1619440	1624840	to connect it to my gotcha and then close the screen, and it would start throwing regular
1624840	1626840	pokeballs at whatever was around me.
1626840	1629520	A lot of things were getting better, people were getting pissed, but here's the thing,
1629520	1635800	the line to get out, so they had an in and out policy, and you had to do your wristband,
1635800	1641240	you boop it out, as I say, you just boop, and you're out, and they stamped you too apparently,
1641240	1644920	but then you can come back in, and you boop back in.
1644920	1652800	The line to leave was so long, people were just staying out of frustration, because it
1652800	1656920	was taking you an hour to try to even get out of the park, you might as well just stay,
1656920	1660240	but some of the experience, the dream that we were sold, right, of everybody playing
1660240	1665000	together and doing this, some of that absolutely was present, because I'm standing on the sidewalk
1665000	1673680	and all of a sudden the crowd politely, some kind of run, nobody's pushing, nobody's, but
1673680	1677400	nobody's pushing, everybody's polite, and they move en masse to this area, and they're
1677400	1678440	like, what's going on?
1678440	1683760	There's a Heracross over here, and you get to hear people are trying to get, oh yeah,
1683760	1688320	oh my god, I got it, oh no, oh no, oh no, wait, you know, that experience was absolutely
1688320	1691440	in small droves there.
1691440	1696720	And you know, I've been feeling a lot of that this weekend, too, throughout Pokemon Go,
1696720	1701120	because now that they've unleashed those legendaries, you know, if you didn't already hear, you
1701120	1706240	can get Lugia and Articuno, but I might be saying that wrong, because I thought it was
1706240	1710760	Arctic, anyway, but those legendaries are out there, and you can go catch them now,
1710760	1714720	and I got to tell you, I've had some really rad experiences, like, you know, I got at
1714720	1720480	a Discord and an Articuno spawn year here, and met up with some other people, people
1720520	1726360	I didn't know, but other nerds from all, all types of people, men, women, all different
1726360	1730960	shapes, sizes, colors, all that, just wanting to get their damn legendary in their Pokedex,
1730960	1734680	and that was really cool, to kind of like come together and do that, and then we played
1734680	1738720	some more, in fact, I almost, I almost killed myself playing Pokemon Go today, because I
1738720	1742160	was an idiot, and they've been doing all these bonuses all weekend, like the double, well
1742160	1745080	not all weekend, but since the event, the double Stardust and everything, I thought
1745080	1749120	it would be a good idea to go play Pokemon Go in the 100 degree heat today, even though
1749160	1752800	yes, I had sunblock, yes, I was hydrating myself, but it was still maybe a little bit
1752800	1757960	much, but anyway, I'm okay, I didn't pass out, like I thought I was going to for a minute,
1757960	1763200	but we, I was even able to do the Lusia fight, we won it, and there was like, there was 40
1763200	1767680	people there, in the middle of downtown Roseville, doing this Lusia fight, when these things
1767680	1773520	are spawning everywhere right now, 40 people in the middle of a suburb, just there to do
1773520	1778240	this stupid game, so I mean, some of that that's been happening is, is really awesome,
1778240	1783480	so it's, it's kind of a bummer that Niantic is still like, I guess too small of a company
1783480	1788880	or something to figure out some of these technical issues, because the game they've got is fucking
1788880	1796160	great, when it works, which unfortunately is only about half the time, and I gotta say
1796160	1802320	too, because some of our folks in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, let's see, over at
1802320	1807200	live.vognetwork.com, they're talking about the host, I guess her name is Rachel Seltzer,
1807200	1813200	I don't know her, but vidpower in chat says she's an esports commentator, and probably
1813200	1816840	what Charles doesn't know, being on the ground, if he was a little far back from the stage,
1816840	1820200	but what you could see on the live stream, I think she left the stage because someone
1820200	1823680	threw a shoe at her, or a bottle or something at her, and it wasn't safe to be out there,
1823680	1829920	and I think that's the real reason she left, which, you know, I understand people are pissed,
1829920	1833480	but that's a shitty thing to do, and if you threw that, you should feel bad, because you're
1833480	1838840	a bad person, you know, because do you think she's the one that, like, went and unplugged
1838840	1840040	the AT&T van?
1840040	1841040	Do you think that was her idea?
1841040	1842040	No.
1842040	1843960	Especially if it's a shoe, because now you're missing a shoe.
1843960	1847200	I think it was a bottle, I don't think, I always assume a rock concert or something
1847200	1851080	is a shoe, but whatever it was, whatever they fucking threw at her, it's not okay, it's
1851080	1857360	not cool, and look, I get that she was a little cheesy, I understand that, I did feel a little
1857360	1860440	bit like, wow, tone it down, honey, but...
1860440	1863160	Can we stop having influencers at these events, please?
1863160	1867080	I think it's part that, it's part influencers, but then I also have to remember, there are
1867080	1871520	a lot of children that play Pokemon Go, and if you ever turn on Nickelodeon, you see a
1871520	1875760	lot of people that are like her, so I kind of have to, like, go, okay, maybe, maybe she's
1875760	1881180	not for me, she's for the kids, and, you know, whatever, but I also kind of agree that influencers
1881180	1886080	as hosts, I don't know about that, but anyway, that's, that's another debate for another
1886080	1887080	time.
1888080	1892120	I want to get to the final thought here, I do want to caution, this last clip does have
1892120	1895000	a little bit of audio tearing in it, but I did think it was important for Charles to
1895000	1898840	get his final thoughts out here in this clip from being on the ground at Pokemon Go Fest.
1898840	1905240	But this is the last thing I'll say, is, how do they not understand the effing tech that
1905240	1906240	goes into this?
1906240	1910720	How do you understand, I get on launch, you never anticipated this, but you know at this
1910720	1916560	point, what happens when you go into a new country, all of a sudden, damn, you're flooded,
1917040	1921240	you launch a brand new thing like the gym revamp, bam, things kind of break, and that's
1921240	1926720	tech, I get that, but when you're doing a festival, you had to have had this stuff launched
1926720	1929800	two weeks ago in the code.
1929800	1936920	I don't care if it's, I don't care about data miners, you had to have this launched two
1936920	1941960	weeks ago, so you could have beta tested it in your office, just made your office a special
1941960	1947640	playground, you know, with that geo-locking, worked it out, got triple the amount of servers
1947640	1953600	you're going to need, paid whatever you had to pay to all the cell providers to make sure
1953600	1958800	they were boosting signal or whatever, it just was frustrating that they don't seem
1958800	1963840	to ever understand how this tech works, and how it affects the community, but lots of
1963840	1967400	people were happy, met a lot of strangers, talked to a lot of people, and it was a lot
1967400	1968400	of fun.
1968400	1972960	I really do, I left there, especially with getting, knowing I was going to get the lugia
1972960	1981960	anyway, leaving there, I left feeling good, and I feel like this year's going to be a
1981960	1986200	hard learning curve for them, but if they really are committed to doing this again,
1986200	1991960	doing more, they're really going to have to hire some massive event planners that do outside
1991960	1992960	events.
1992960	1995880	I mean, I'm talking about big companies that are going to cost you some money, but they
1995880	2000120	know exactly what to do, and then really get their servers right.
2000120	2001120	So that's it.
2001120	2007400	I'm Charles with Polymer, I've got a podcast, and check out Pokemon Go Podcast at PokemonGoPodcast.com,
2007400	2010760	and we're here, and we're honored to have Rob on a couple of weeks ago, got lots of
2010760	2015800	great feedback from you, man, everybody's loved you, so definitely come back again.
2015800	2018680	I absolutely will, Charles, and thank you so much for leaving that.
2018680	2024140	Again, I had to edit down a 27-minute message down to the 10 or 11 minutes we played here,
2024140	2027180	but Charles took time out of his day to leave that for us, and I really, really appreciate
2027180	2030540	that, especially with such a fast turnaround, because I literally messaged him last night,
2030540	2033780	like, we should really get you on OLR this week since you were there, and I want to know
2033780	2034820	what it was like on the ground.
2034820	2036580	So thank you, Charles, for leaving that message for us.
2036580	2039080	Everybody check out Pokemon Go Podcast.
2039080	2043900	He will tell much more about a lot more of the details on that program, but I want to
2043900	2048260	thank him for giving us a little preview here.
2048260	2052740	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Land Radio at vognetwork.com,
2052740	2055420	use the passphrase, bread.
2082740	2087380	I've got to come a point where I have to give Niantic a little tough love, and it's time
2087380	2091220	for Niantic to grow the fuck up or sell.
2091220	2095780	Like this, from my perspective, this is the crossroads, Niantic is that, and this festival
2095780	2097660	kind of only proves that for me.
2097660	2101900	They either need to grow the fuck up, meaning they're going to have to get the bodies in
2101900	2106620	there, they're going to have to get the investors or the people, or somehow raise the funds
2106620	2111860	to get the staffing and be the large company that a game like Pokemon Go needs, or sell
2111860	2113900	to a company who can do it.
2113900	2117660	Because after this whole thing happened, my honest to God first reaction, I heard they
2117660	2120580	went up on stage and said, everybody's getting a refund and we're going to give out a hundred
2120580	2121980	dollars in pokey coins.
2121980	2125620	My honest to God reaction was, they're going to be sold next week.
2125620	2130300	Niantic's going to be forced to sell to somebody next week to a company who can handle the
2130300	2131300	infrastructure.
2131300	2132860	God, please don't sell the Nintendo.
2132860	2135060	They can't handle the infrastructure.
2135060	2138540	Here's the weird thing, Niantic was a Google company.
2138540	2142620	The only reason Niantic is no longer a Google company is because Google did that whole alphabet
2142620	2146300	split that they did a couple years ago, and Niantic was kind of left out of that, but
2146300	2150220	that was because they had the backing from Nintendo now.
2150220	2152220	But we didn't know that at the time, we know it now.
2152220	2155460	They had the backing from Nintendo, and Google is still a major backer in this.
2155460	2160900	So I sort of think it would make a lot of sense for Google to kind of bring them back,
2160900	2166220	but at the same time, there's a lot of business elements there that I will fully admit I don't
2166220	2172900	understand, but I just feel like after the disaster that happened in Chicago, something's
2172900	2174000	got to give.
2174000	2179540	This game has got to grow the fuck up, because there's a lot of potential in this game that
2179540	2187340	keeps getting ruined by technical things that can't be handled, and again, I think one of
2187340	2192060	the most damning things is what Charles pointed out there, the whole fact that Niantic is
2192060	2196500	trying to blame the cell phone companies, yet I was live streaming.
2196500	2197500	I was tweeting.
2197500	2200600	I was on Discord.
2200600	2202180	It's not the cell phone companies.
2202180	2205180	It's your game.
2205180	2206180	Any thoughts, Loki?
2206180	2209300	I know you're a Pokemon, Dark Soccer, anything you guys want to add based on what Charles
2209300	2211380	said and your thoughts on the event?
2211380	2212380	I don't know.
2212380	2219820	I played a little bit this weekend while I was at a park with my kids, and I was expecting
2219820	2221740	some different spawns.
2221740	2227460	I got a Poliwag or whatever that is, which I thought was a water Pokemon, so it was kind
2227460	2231620	of weird that it was spawning that park.
2231620	2235180	But yeah, other than that, I was like, eh, I don't want to play this anymore.
2235180	2238380	Let me get to some comments from our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, because of course
2238380	2242100	we do tape live Sunday nights at 6 Pacific 9 Eastern at vognetwork.com.
2242100	2247420	JD over in chat says, how many chances are we going to continue to give Niantic to get
2247420	2248420	their shit together?
2248420	2252500	They have clearly demonstrated that they learned absolutely nothing from the past year
2252500	2253500	of running the game.
2253500	2258420	Sj100Matt says, if you, Niantic, didn't expect this outcome, then you didn't learn from the
2258420	2261420	disaster when the game first came out.
2261420	2265180	Let's see, JD wonders, who would Niantic even sell to?
2265180	2269980	Like I mean, I don't think Google would take them back, Sj100Matt proposes Amazon.
2269980	2276820	Come on, Noel Gus says, Niantic is that X that you can't quit, but should.
2276820	2280140	That's kind of how I feel about Ingress once in a while, it's like, I really need to break
2280140	2281140	up with you.
2281140	2282140	I did play a little bit of Ingress.
2282140	2285420	Yeah, it's like, once in a while, the sex is kind of good, you know?
2285420	2287940	Well, it was just like, okay, here's why I played Ingress.
2287940	2290740	Blowing up a portal feels real good once in a while.
2290740	2294540	Here's why I played Ingress this weekend, because I was playing Pokemon Go and I caught
2294540	2298300	all the Pokemon in the area that I was sitting in and nothing was spawning.
2298300	2299900	I was like, okay, fuck this shit.
2299900	2300900	Went to Ingress.
2300900	2302380	Oh, hey, there's an unclaimed portal.
2302380	2303380	Captured it.
2303380	2304380	Hacked it.
2304380	2308420	Shut it off.
2308420	2312820	Stoppy in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says about Charles's clip, this is like listening
2312820	2314100	to a police confession.
2314100	2315100	Maybe he was wearing a wire.
2315100	2318340	It was, it was a little bit like that, but as we know, Charles live streaming may have
2318340	2320100	brought down the entire event.
2320100	2321500	We heard that.
2321500	2327340	Let's see, act deft in chat says, I won't ever go back to Ingress, Sj100Matt says, I
2327340	2332020	would buy it if they came out and said people were spoofing location or DDoSing to mess
2332020	2333020	up the event.
2333020	2335940	I mean, that's a gimme excuse, but the game was working everywhere else.
2335940	2340540	And again, I want to point out, it's not all necessary, necessarily bad news.
2340540	2345420	And that's why I'm not willing to say, because that would be a game's adoration.
2345420	2349880	That would be a Forbes headline to say this game is shit, write it off as the shit it
2349880	2355180	is and stop playing that shit because Pokemon Go isn't shit.
2355180	2362180	It's just some of the tech behind it and some of the support the game is getting is shit.
2362180	2363180	I don't know about that.
2363180	2365980	There's still no game to it yet, other than collecting Pokemon.
2365980	2371260	I think the gym, I think the gym thing really, really revitalized, it gave the game a kick
2371260	2377820	in the ass that it needed, but there's still no scoring, no game, no like, you know, teams.
2377820	2379380	It doesn't fucking matter.
2379380	2384820	I still think for the folks that are collecting, there's a lot there to do and the team bonuses.
2384820	2387960	Trust me, you need those extra balls when you're catching those legendaries.
2387960	2390580	So you know, there's, is it perfect?
2390580	2391580	No.
2391580	2395060	Any mobile game that wants to stay relevant should continue to invent itself every few
2395060	2396060	months.
2396060	2398100	But anyway, I know this topic's gone on a long time.
2398100	2402020	Again, I really want to thank Charles for leaving us that message and being kind of
2402020	2405800	a guest correspondent tonight on the show and I want to encourage anybody who does love
2405800	2411260	Pokemon Go like I still do, but even you still get frustrated with people that you love once
2411260	2415880	in a while, check out Pokemon Go podcast because there's a lot of great discussion there and
2415880	2420780	I'm sure he'll tell us much more that we didn't get here on the show tonight.
2420780	2425560	But yeah, I mean, it's going to be an interesting next couple weeks to see what the fallout
2425560	2426800	truly is from this.
2426800	2430480	And if Niantic really does try to do this again in 2018, you know, John Hanke teased
2430480	2435120	on stage a Pokemon Go 2018 and this was before the refund chat.
2435120	2438160	So we'll see, we'll see.
2438160	2439160	All right.
2439160	2440600	Anyhow, let's move on.
2440600	2443640	We got to get to some more stories because there's a lot of gaming stories that happened
2443640	2448260	this week, but of course, uh, it would not be a show unless we talked about our own gaming
2448260	2450640	weeks and the types of video games that you've been playing this week.
2450640	2452320	So Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
2452320	2458300	Uh, I finally beat the main story of Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2, um, while streaming with
2458300	2460720	all of three people watching at 3 AM.
2460720	2462800	Um, it was fun.
2462800	2463800	It's cute.
2463800	2470000	I will go back and replay all the scenarios, um, in order for anyone who wants to see them.
2470000	2474800	Um, that's kind of it other than the cell phone games.
2474800	2478960	Uh, and so you are streaming again, so if people aren't following you on Twitch, they
2478960	2479960	can follow you at...
2479960	2485080	Basically stream me when I'm bored, but it's DarkSakura underscore O-L-R.
2485080	2486080	Okay, awesome.
2486080	2490300	Um, and you are hosted, I double checked the VoG network, uh, or the VoG network on Twitch
2490300	2491300	hosts you automatically.
2491300	2495920	So, all right, I'll set up all the hosting stuff, but like I spent like an hour or so
2495920	2498680	putting together my offline banner and whatnot, which is...
2498680	2499680	It's important.
2499680	2505960	It's a combination of the style for the Danganronpa things and then my Dragon Ball character.
2505960	2508720	Are you going to continue to Dragon Ball or is there other games you're looking at doing?
2508720	2509960	Are you going to do Dream Daddy?
2509960	2511760	Because that's the one everybody's doing right now.
2511760	2516960	I haven't bought Dream Daddy yet, so I'm not going to play that one since everyone else
2516960	2517960	is.
2517960	2518960	Yeah.
2518960	2524860	But I'm probably going to do, um, uh, Danganronpa, Ultra Despair Girls, and, uh, How to Fool
2524860	2527200	Boyfriend and Holiday Star down the line.
2527200	2528200	Nice.
2528200	2533160	Um, I don't know, I'll find something else kind of weird and interesting to stream.
2533160	2534160	All right.
2534160	2535920	Loki, how was your gaming week?
2535920	2537360	I didn't really play anything, honestly.
2537360	2542800	I played very little of, um, the Office Space Clicker game.
2542800	2544400	I'm kind of getting bored of it.
2544400	2551240	Um, and then Pokémon GO, I really, I haven't really played that much this week, maybe once
2551240	2556720	or twice at the most, and Ingress, like I said, I touched it for like maybe two minutes
2556720	2558160	and that was it.
2558160	2564480	I meant to play Superhot VR, because I have that now, but, um, I just hadn't gotten around
2564480	2565880	to setting it up.
2565880	2570640	I still want to get one of those Oculus Rift, but $400 is a lot of money right now.
2570640	2571640	Yeah, it is.
2571640	2576680	I still want it, but yeah, it's hard to like, if I'd known that like a couple months ago,
2576680	2580800	I could have budgeted better, but yeah, it's not working out right now.
2580800	2581800	All right.
2581800	2582800	Uh, my gaming week.
2582800	2585880	Obviously, I played a lot of Pokémon GO, as I've talked about earlier.
2585880	2590560	Continuing to play the Final Fantasy XII HD remaster, um, I've now passed the point
2590560	2594040	in this one than I did when I originally played the game on PlayStation 2, so that's really
2594040	2595040	cool.
2595040	2598320	Um, so I've been playing more of that and I love the remaster.
2598320	2603080	Unfortunately, I keep getting distracted by groups for Final Fantasy XIV, because I'm
2603080	2604320	still trying to run my characters in that.
2604320	2605320	I got it.
2605320	2609320	This is a story that we didn't, I don't think it was in our show role, but I saw this somewhere
2609320	2610360	because they were complaining about it.
2610360	2611360	I haven't read on it.
2611360	2612360	Okay.
2612360	2613360	Oh, is it?
2613360	2614360	I'm sorry.
2614360	2615360	It was in other territories is what it was.
2615840	2621120	They had raised the cost, the monthly fee for other territories outside of the US to
2621120	2622760	get in line.
2622760	2627240	So like in other areas, like it was equivalent of like $45 a month.
2627240	2628240	Wow.
2628240	2629240	Yeah.
2629240	2630240	It's ridiculous.
2630240	2631240	That's weird.
2631240	2632240	For Final Fantasy XIV?
2632240	2633240	Well, yeah.
2633240	2636520	It's for like other territories that don't like, economically, they're not up to our
2636520	2637520	level.
2637520	2638520	Okay.
2638520	2640120	So like that was like, you know, quite a bit of money.
2640120	2641120	Interesting.
2641120	2643800	But I'd like to know what is World of Warcraft costs in those countries?
2644240	2645240	Is that a competitive price?
2645240	2646240	I don't know.
2646240	2647240	Yeah.
2647240	2648240	Who knows?
2648240	2649240	Interesting.
2649240	2653160	Well, anyway, here, the game's still running great and I'm having a good time.
2653160	2656080	They did a little patch this week.
2656080	2659240	They put out the raids not that long ago and now you can get the more advanced tomes.
2659240	2660240	There's more stuff to explore.
2660240	2661240	So I've been doing that.
2661240	2665060	I think I did a live stream earlier this week of Final Fantasy XIV.
2665060	2668440	And then this weekend I've been playing a bit of Splatoon 2 just came out.
2668440	2672160	So I did pick up Splatoon 2 on the Switch and I've been playing that.
2672160	2678120	And I'm, you know, it is, there are a lot of similarities to Splatoon 1, obviously.
2678120	2682740	The multiplayer feels very, very similar, but Splatoon 1's multiplayer wasn't exactly
2682740	2685300	broken in the formula of how the game works.
2685300	2686600	So they didn't change a lot.
2686600	2687960	So I think that's good.
2687960	2693880	I do love it on the Switch because of the fact that you can do the portable as well.
2693880	2697520	So I can kind of play it while I'm in bed and do the multiplayer, you know, stuff that
2697520	2698520	way.
2698520	2703720	Or, you know, I can play it on the TV and I can use, you know, the dog ear controller
2703720	2704720	if I want.
2704720	2709280	I've been trying to force myself to learn motion controls, but one thing I'm finding
2709280	2714120	is that I just can't do it if I'm playing a paint roller, which I tend to do in multiplayer
2714120	2715120	mode.
2715120	2717920	Like I just don't see how motion control benefits the paint roller thing.
2717920	2721480	Somebody was trying to tell me, oh, well for the splashing and that it was like, I can't
2721480	2722480	do it.
2722480	2723920	It just, it throws me off so much.
2723920	2728760	And I was enjoying, like, there's like a gun that kind of like, it fires a lot of paint
2728760	2729880	in a straight line.
2729880	2732320	It's supposed to be like a sniper rifle basically.
2732320	2735480	So I was, I was really enjoying like how that weapon was functioning.
2735480	2737220	So I was like trying to play with it.
2737220	2742820	And I did find that using motion controls for that is a little more like mouse.
2742820	2747800	It feels, you know, it feels a lot better than say like the, even, you know, the Wii
2747800	2751160	U or the Wii or whatever, because obviously motion controls have progressed a lot now
2751160	2752560	that we're here on the Switch.
2752560	2758400	So the motion controls, like they feel nice, but yet my scores in those matches were atrocious.
2758400	2762560	So I must not know what the fuck I'm doing with the sniper rifle, but like, I'm trying
2762560	2766320	to learn the motion control, but when I play single, single player mode, I'm kind of like
2766320	2770520	forcing myself to use motion control and I'm, I'm, I'm doing okay.
2770520	2774040	So you know, it has a lot of the same stuff from Splatoon 1, but it's just different now
2774040	2776180	because they have a new single player mode.
2776180	2779640	There is a co-op mode, but admittedly I've done nothing other than the tutorial.
2779640	2781400	So I don't have a lot to say about that yet.
2781440	2784760	I've just been trying to focus on the multiplayer when I have been playing it.
2784760	2787800	I've been losing a lot of matches, but I've been winning a few.
2787800	2792520	So I do feel like the game might be waiting because I noticed there's this little icon
2792520	2796920	where this number changes and I'm like, is that like my streak balance or something where
2796920	2799600	like if I'm winning a lot of matches, it's going to give me harder opponents.
2799600	2801720	If I'm losing a lot, it's going to give me easier ones.
2801720	2805960	I think that might be what it's doing because it does feel like I don't lose a lot in a
2805960	2807720	row until I finally win one.
2807720	2811360	So, you know, props to the matchmaking in that regard.
2811360	2815320	I know it's coming up later in the show about Nintendo's whole app and all that stuff.
2815320	2820520	Admittedly, I haven't even tried the online, like trying to find to play with a friend
2820520	2823920	or I haven't even done, I haven't touched it because everybody and everything on the
2823920	2825360	internet is just, it's garbage.
2825360	2828960	So I'm like, I'm not going to touch it yet.
2828960	2834200	Anyway, is there other ways to like, you know, set up games without the app?
2834200	2835040	Yeah, oh yeah.
2835040	2837320	You could just go into join a friend in progress.
2837320	2840920	And I think some people did that for me because I saw a Twitter handle that follows me on
2840960	2844880	Twitter and I was like, I think that person's a Twitter, but I don't know because the game
2844880	2848720	doesn't tell you, oh, this is your friend or you know, whatever.
2848720	2853800	It doesn't tell you anything about who's joining your match or when or guaranteeing putting
2853800	2855760	you on the same team or anything like that.
2855760	2859520	Anyway, I do plan to do Splatoon 2 after the show tonight.
2859520	2864600	So maybe I'll learn a little bit more about the multiplayer then, but it definitely is
2864600	2867300	not, it's not Overwatch.
2867300	2868560	Let's put it that way.
2868560	2873520	It is not the matchmaking capabilities of a game like Overwatch or Call of Duty or one
2873520	2874520	of those things.
2874520	2877960	And I think we all know that based on what we're hearing of the app, which we'll hear
2877960	2880200	a little more about later on in the show.
2880200	2885840	But I've just accepted the fact that I'm playing mostly with randoms and it's fine.
2885840	2890200	But like, you know, if somebody joins my game and it says, let's say, cause the name that
2890200	2892760	shows up is just the name you play with on the Wii.
2892760	2895840	So let's say somebody joins my game and it's Shane.
2895880	2899640	Is it the Shane I know from Ranger Pride that comes on this show occasionally?
2899640	2903200	Or is it just some other guy that happens to be named Shane?
2903200	2904200	I don't know.
2904200	2905720	Cause the game doesn't tell me.
2905720	2910240	So there's just, there's a lot of weird shit when it comes to the online support that I
2910240	2912200	feel like they still have to figure out.
2912200	2915720	And I feel like maybe the team has one vision, but then it's like Nintendo's infrastructure
2915720	2917320	might limit them on some things.
2917320	2922720	So I'm hoping through patches, they're able to make some more of this make sense.
2923360	2927200	As far as the game itself, I'm fine.
2927200	2931640	Like, you know, I feel like I might even be having a little more fun with it this time
2931640	2934760	than I was when I first played it on Wii U, just because I feel like I understand the
2934760	2938480	game a little better just from watching other people play it and live streams and stuff.
2938480	2940760	So I mean, you know, that part's cool.
2940760	2945000	I do feel like when I do the paint roller, I am learning how to do things like how to
2945000	2946680	sneak up on people.
2946680	2951120	Like you know, I got an ability that makes, when I swim, I'm more like a Ninja.
2951120	2952640	I'm a lot harder to spot.
2952640	2956480	So I'm getting really good at swimming up behind people and splat them with the roller.
2956480	2957800	So like, I'm learning little tricks like that.
2957800	2960560	And that does feel really good that like, oh, I'm progressing this time.
2960560	2961640	That's nice.
2961640	2963600	So there you go.
2963600	2969040	Anyway, let's see, I'm trying to look in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
2969040	2971960	It sounds like ActDeft had some real issues getting the game.
2971960	2974320	I guess Amazon strikes again.
2974320	2977120	ActDeft says I'll have to wait until Tuesday.
2977120	2981640	And that's because, oh, it's UPS or USPS's fault, which I think are the vendors that
2981640	2985880	Amazon uses, question mark, anyway.
2985880	2991400	Let's see, other comments in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
2991400	2998320	Let's see, yeah, oh no, ActDeft is definitely blaming Amazon as I scroll up there.
2998320	2999320	What's happening there?
2999320	3002800	I don't see a lot of other people that have been playing Splatoon commenting on that.
3002800	3004280	But maybe we'll get some more there.
3004280	3008520	So yeah, again, I've been enjoying the game.
3008520	3013920	I will probably enjoy it more when they can make the friends and joining people seamless.
3013920	3018040	And this whole fact that co-op mode is only available some of the time, which is so fucking
3018040	3019040	weird to me.
3019040	3023400	Yeah, I saw your post and I was like, so it's like up for 24 hours and then down for 24
3023400	3024400	hours?
3024400	3025760	Well, that's what I heard it was supposed to be.
3025760	3029960	But then this weekend, it's been mostly up, except it will be down for random ass two
3029960	3030960	hour periods.
3030960	3035320	Like it does, it just, it doesn't make sense.
3035320	3038880	Like a lot of Nintendo online things, it doesn't make sense.
3038880	3044160	And this continues the trend, which is unfortunate because the game is a lot of fun when you
3044160	3045480	know you can play it.
3045480	3049560	So anyway, all right, let's move on.
3049560	3052800	I want to get into some gaming news because I know we're going to talk about this Nintendo
3052800	3054840	online thing in a little bit.
3054840	3056360	Just some quick announcements.
3056360	3059120	First off, we will not be here over Labor Day weekend.
3059120	3061280	I will be in Atlanta at Dragon Con.
3061280	3066560	So if you are in the Southeast area, anywhere near Atlanta, you should come to Dragon Con
3066560	3067840	and have fun.
3067840	3068840	Party with us.
3068840	3071840	I should know a little more about panels, appearances, things like that a little closer
3071840	3073040	to the show.
3073040	3075760	So I'll be plugging those again.
3075760	3077280	You can find me at Dragon Con.
3077280	3078280	I'll be there.
3078280	3079280	Bobby Blackolf would be there.
3079280	3080840	I think John from Critical Myth is there.
3080840	3082520	I know some other folks from VOG Network.
3082520	3084920	I don't know the full roll call, but I know some other folks will be there too.
3084920	3085920	So it'll be a lot of fun.
3085920	3091320	All right, let's get into some gaming news for tonight's Loki starting us off.
3091320	3095400	So in like, I will never ask for this news.
3095400	3099160	Atari has announced that they're releasing a new console.
3099160	3101440	The Atari box.
3101440	3105160	It's a PC based system that's going to play old and current games.
3105160	3106760	They haven't announced the price point.
3106760	3110240	They've released a picture though that looks kind of neat, like the faux wood green on
3110240	3113240	the front there and the glowing Atari logo.
3113240	3117360	And then they also have one I think that resembles the 7800 maybe?
3117360	3121600	With the red logo in all black.
3121600	3126120	So that's literally all we know about it right now, other than I guess they said they're
3126120	3131600	going to be funding the console via crowdfunding, hooray!
3131600	3134360	And we'll be listening closely to community feedback.
3134360	3144520	Although it reminds me so much of like the Coleco chameleon, you know?
3144520	3145520	Yeah.
3145520	3150600	I don't think you're supposed to put water in that.
3150600	3158080	I think that the crowdsourcing on there is probably more of a desperate attempt for them
3158080	3162160	to try to make sure they can get the money on it.
3162160	3167040	But I don't get why.
3167040	3169960	I looked at it and I just was like, why?
3169960	3172800	Well, I mean it depends.
3172800	3175240	Some of Atari's games are interesting.
3175240	3176840	I don't know.
3176840	3181920	They've had so many Atari consoles come out, like the whole flashback consoles.
3181920	3187120	I don't know if I'd really want to play more like 2600 games or anything like that.
3187120	3193600	But I'd be interested to see like, you know, other Atari games that like maybe Hellesu
3193600	3194600	Arcade.
3194600	3199880	Imagine like arcade titles, like if they had like good emulation of arcade titles like
3199880	3202360	San Francisco Rush.
3202360	3206280	But I think that their whole thing that they're going for is the classic Atari.
3206280	3208680	Well everything's classic now for Atari.
3208680	3215280	I mean the real classic Atari, the 2600, the 5200, and the 7800.
3215280	3216280	I don't know.
3216280	3219680	I hope that there's more to it than just that because I don't see why I would need to get
3219680	3221640	a console for that.
3221640	3222640	Okay, sorry guys.
3222640	3226000	Loki made the offhanded comment about the water because I just spilled water all over
3226000	3227000	the keyboard.
3227000	3230160	So I'm going to pray that I still have a working keyboard or trying to finish tonight's show.
3230160	3232040	It's going to be interesting.
3232040	3235160	But in the meantime, that's why I got real quiet there for a minute.
3235160	3240000	It might understand that this thing is like if the Ouya and an Atari flashback console
3240000	3241000	had a baby.
3241000	3242000	Is that basically what this is?
3242000	3245800	Well, as far as we know right now, because all we know is that it's a box and that it's
3245800	3247920	going to have some sort of components inside of it.
3247920	3251560	As far as what it's going to do and how powerful it is and how much it costs and how they're
3251560	3254480	going to fund it and how can I buy one.
3254480	3255920	We don't know any of that.
3255920	3263080	But now am I wrong in thinking they just announced the Atari flashback eight, seven or eight
3263080	3264080	if I'm not...
3264080	3265080	Eight.
3265080	3266080	Yeah.
3266080	3267080	They just announced that either this week.
3267080	3270200	I don't know if somebody else holds the license for that or what have you, but I know they're
3270200	3271920	getting Activision games this time.
3271920	3274360	Yeah, Activision games and HDMI out.
3274360	3275680	It's going to do 720p.
3275680	3280640	So honestly, right now I'm more jazzed about that flashback console because it's going
3280640	3284760	to have kaboom capers and pitfall and some of the Activision classics.
3284760	3287440	I don't know that I would want to play them in 1080p.
3287440	3290760	So when I say kaboom, I ran two games together.
3290760	3293280	Kaboom and Keystone capers are going to be in there anyway.
3293280	3296680	I don't know that I would want to play them in 1080p because I'll be honest when we do
3296680	3302240	Atari party, we have ours hooked up to some pretty nice high res monitors and it just
3302240	3303240	doesn't look the same.
3303240	3304360	I like my flicker.
3304360	3305360	It's all good.
3306040	3312000	It'll just be one like fuzzy mess, but that's what, I mean, to be fair, I mean, most people
3312000	3316120	that buy these flashback consoles, aren't, uh, I don't know what the word would be classic
3316120	3322920	gaming purists, I guess for lack of a better term, um, that, well, the reality is most
3322920	3326080	people don't have those TVs anymore.
3326080	3329400	So if they're going to buy a console like this, they have to have HDMI, right?
3329400	3331740	Even though it might not look quite right.
3331740	3336440	But anyway, my point is as, as cool as these Atari flashback console sound, it sounds like
3336440	3342380	this thing that's coming out is just one of those mashed with some type of open-ended
3342380	3343380	question mark.
3343380	3348060	I mean, I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt until if it's crowdfunded, if
3348060	3350700	it's crowdfunded, I'm not, well, right.
3350700	3352300	I who said I'm going to back it.
3352300	3354300	I'm not backing that shit.
3354300	3356820	I mean, I'm just curious to see what it is.
3356820	3357940	Like I'm not pulling it.
3357940	3360060	I learned my lesson with OUYA.
3360060	3361540	That's enough.
3361540	3362540	Don't get me wrong.
3362540	3363540	That shell looks awesome.
3363540	3368220	Like if anything, the very least, I'd love one of those, you know, Atari, the Atari box
3368220	3372420	with the wood grain on the front as a shell for like a raspberry pie or something like
3372420	3373420	that.
3373420	3374460	Cause that shit looks nice.
3374460	3377220	But I mean, other than that, yeah, who knows?
3377220	3378220	I don't know.
3378220	3382060	It'd be interesting to see, and it's kind of just out of nowhere.
3382060	3383060	It's like, okay.
3383060	3384060	It was very random.
3384060	3385060	Right.
3385060	3387060	Um, you know, it's got SD card support as well.
3387060	3389820	I don't know.
3389820	3393940	Going to live.vognetwork.com, Hitstun says, wait, we know what's, we know what's in the
3393940	3394940	Atari box.
3394940	3396460	I was hoping for Jaguar games.
3396460	3399140	Uh, well they haven't ruled it out.
3399140	3404020	So tempest 2000 could still be a reality, but don't count on it.
3404020	3406300	I just hope it's not their new new Atari games.
3406300	3408620	Cause apparently their new new Atari games are really shit.
3408620	3414180	Like there was a roller coaster tycoon world apparently not so good.
3414180	3418900	And the last alone, the dark game that they put out was shit.
3418900	3422260	Doomplague in chat says we're talking about a company that filed bankruptcy and sold all
3422260	3426500	of its modern franchises, then said they would focus on casino games.
3426500	3431380	Uh, dungeon buster says, I'm curious to see what it is, but my expectations are set way
3431380	3432860	low for this thing.
3432860	3436620	Uh, and that's probably the boat I'm in is I'm like, Ooh, I kind of want to get where
3436620	3441420	those Atari flashback consoles, Atari box crowdfunding.
3441420	3442860	Good luck guys.
3442860	3446060	We'll see when you get all the details at the very least, you know, one of those is
3446060	3447060	going to come out.
3447060	3448660	The other one on the other hand, you have no idea.
3449420	3452820	Cause they could, they say, Oh yeah, we're going to release this, it's grand crowdfunded
3452820	3455420	and no one gives a shit and then it doesn't get crowdfunded.
3455420	3456420	All right.
3456420	3459780	Well, another thing that's been going on this weekend is San Diego comic con.
3459780	3462900	And I know a lot of you guys been watching for what's been coming out of that because
3462900	3467340	there's, you know, there's always some announcements and things that can directly affect video
3467340	3468340	games.
3468340	3472060	For example, more characters being announced for Marvel versus Capcom infinite.
3472060	3478420	Uh, some of the confirmations we got at, uh, uh, San Diego comic con include, uh, Frank
3478420	3482300	West, Mike Hagar and nemesis.
3482300	3485700	So we got to see some of those, uh, uh, in the game.
3485700	3486700	And that's pretty cool.
3486700	3490740	Cause obviously Frank West from dead rising, very popular character, Mike Hagar final fight.
3490740	3494220	So, you know, uh, some good Capcom stars to be in that game.
3494220	3499100	Uh, which I think even though a lot of people are kind of like, I don't know, they're all
3499100	3501420	in the roster that leaked out a while ago.
3501420	3505820	So, uh, but dark soccer, you, you still want to give this game a chance, right?
3505820	3506820	Yeah.
3506820	3507820	We'll see.
3507820	3508820	I do.
3508820	3513460	Do you look, will you be playing as Frank West or Mike Hagar nemesis?
3513460	3514460	We'll see.
3514460	3515460	We'll see.
3515460	3517800	Uh, Oh, here's a, okay.
3517800	3521580	So they released this on, uh, mobile phones this week.
3521580	3525000	It is a crossover between hello kitty and Pac-Man.
3525000	3526000	That's right.
3526000	3527000	It's hello kitty and Pac-Man.
3527000	3531440	Uh, and uh, it's in the regular Pac-Man mobile game, which is available on the Google play
3531440	3533280	store in the Apple app store.
3533280	3537280	And uh, what they did at comic con though is that there's actually crossover themed
3537280	3538680	merchandise.
3538680	3544040	And that part might be really cool, but let me tell you this, uh, Alan saw the thing about
3544040	3546560	hello kitty and Pac-Man and said, Oh Rob, you got to download the game.
3546560	3552000	So I did fucking garbage.
3552000	3555600	And I like a lot of retro stuff and I like Pac-Man.
3555600	3558000	I fucking have streamed championship edition two.
3558000	3564240	I think championship edition DX is great mobile phone game ass.
3564240	3565960	Like it's just, it's not good guys.
3565960	3566960	It's not good.
3566960	3567960	I'm sorry.
3567960	3568960	There's no nice way for me to put it.
3568960	3570480	It just doesn't translate well to a mobile phone.
3570480	3574320	Again, the lack of a tactile controller does not do it any favors.
3574320	3579800	And these whole, like, it's a freemium game where you have to either buy the coins or
3579800	3584640	earn the coins in these really basic mazes or just, it's just, it's silly.
3584680	3587360	They just do look kind of cute though.
3587360	3588360	That's not it.
3588360	3589360	Hard pass.
3589360	3590560	All right.
3590560	3594640	But something that I'm really curious to see if Loki is going to give a hard pass or a,
3594640	3599200	uh, I'm going out to get in line right now is of course a lot of gamers are taking great
3599200	3602960	interest in the upcoming movie for ready player one.
3602960	3609480	And as Loki was hoping, the first teaser was indeed released at San Diego comic con and
3609480	3612800	Loki I'm dying to know what you think.
3612800	3613880	It was fucking awesome.
3613880	3614880	Yeah.
3614880	3618760	Like it's, it's seriously, I've watched that trailer like 75 times already.
3618760	3619760	75 times?
3619760	3620760	Yeah.
3620760	3623800	It's, it's, it's so like, don't get me wrong.
3623800	3628760	Like my wife read the book as well and she said it was just garbage.
3628760	3635280	I mean it is a lot of it's just like listing off shit from the eighties.
3635280	3636280	That's fine.
3636280	3640300	But along with that, if you just ignore the bad writing, because a lot of people ignore
3640300	3643480	bad writing and both like the 50 shades of gray fucking twilight.
3643480	3644480	Yeah.
3644480	3645480	Yeah.
3645480	3646480	You know all that shit.
3646480	3647480	So they ignore the Harry Potter.
3647480	3648480	Just kidding.
3648480	3649480	Just kidding.
3649480	3651200	We're not seeing, this is like fucking literally, this isn't like a literary masterpiece or
3651200	3652200	anything like that.
3652200	3653480	I'm not going to fucking say that at all.
3653480	3660720	It's it's schlock, but it's got some awesome, you know, the story's pretty cool.
3660720	3664600	And like the set pieces and like action that are described in there, it's just fucking
3664600	3665600	amazing.
3665600	3669000	Like you read that and you're like, there's no way they can make this into a movie because
3669000	3672320	it'd be fucking expensive with all the licensing they would have to do.
3672320	3676720	And just looking at the trailer, cause a lot of this stuff in the trailer, like half the
3676720	3678660	trailer is not in the book.
3678660	3680880	The whole racing thing is not part of the book.
3680880	3681880	It's new.
3681880	3687920	Um, so it's good that they're deviating from that, but it looks so fucking cool.
3687920	3692700	I even, I noticed I was just like, it's so goddamn awesome.
3692700	3694000	Like a big CG Fest.
3694000	3695000	I don't care.
3695000	3697960	I'm in, it's, it's in the future.
3697960	3701340	I guess CG Fest is a lot, but even I noticed, I was like, is that Freddy Krueger?
3701340	3702740	Is that the Iron Giant?
3702740	3704860	Like what the fuck?
3704860	3709700	Fucking Freddy Krueger, the Iron Giant, they had Duke Nukem in there at one point, Deathstroke,
3709700	3714740	Harley Quinn, you know, um, I mean there's like tons of references to all sorts of stuff.
3714740	3717080	If it's in a Warner Brothers movie, it's probably in here somewhere.
3717080	3720700	And even like something that's, you know, maybe not Warner Brothers as well.
3720700	3723840	I mean, so it, it looks really awesome.
3723840	3731020	So I'm very down to see what this is going to be like and yeah, I'll be there day one.
3731020	3732020	Absolutely.
3732020	3735580	I mean, it's just, and then also like the, like the musical tones with it.
3735580	3738620	I mean, it's just like, so I did enjoy the rush.
3738620	3739620	See, I watched the trailer.
3739620	3741620	I don't know shit about the book other than Loki's.
3741620	3742620	You gotta read the book.
3742620	3743620	I have the book.
3743620	3744620	You can read the book.
3744620	3746980	Uh, Loki's always very excited about it.
3746980	3749340	Uh, here's, here's just a plot twist.
3749340	3753940	It'll have a lot more chance of actually getting read if I get an audio book just because for
3753940	3755140	commutes and things like that.
3755140	3757660	Like I just, the audio book is narrated by Wil Wheaton.
3757660	3758660	So that's cool.
3758660	3759660	All right.
3759660	3764420	Uh, even I noticed with the trailer, I was like, all right, this looks like it could
3764420	3765700	be, I don't read books.
3765700	3766700	Okay.
3766700	3769100	I don't like reading books, but this book, I couldn't put it down.
3769100	3771540	Um, I noticed rush was in the trailer.
3771540	3777740	That's a big part of in, in, in the, the spoiler for the book, I guess in the book, there's
3777740	3783700	a guitar hero type thing that he has to do that he has to play Tom Sawyer, I think, or
3783700	3784700	I think that's what it was.
3784700	3787380	I, yeah, it's been a while since I read the book, but which I think that song was actually
3787380	3788380	in guitar heroes.
3788420	3790860	I think he has to play that song or something like rock.
3790860	3793100	He has to do a guitar hero type thing in there.
3793100	3799020	But um, yeah, I mean it, it definitely, it's all the, um, the people that were in the race
3799020	3803260	or they call them the Sixers, they're part of this, um, internet company that's evil
3803260	3804740	and shit.
3804740	3808740	And so of course they're out to find, you know, the hidden Easter egg as well.
3808740	3812240	So I mean they, they're using the power of money to be able to do all that.
3812240	3815940	But yeah, I mean it's got like, you know, Artemis, one of the characters in the book,
3815980	3822380	she's got a, um, a cross between Canada's bike from Akira and I'll Tron light cycle
3822380	3828020	and, you know, and of course, um, the main character, Wade, he's got, it's supposed to
3828020	3833620	be a cross between the Ecto one, the, uh, back to the future DeLorean and the Knight
3833620	3836540	Rider, um, kit car.
3836540	3840340	This sounds like internet fanfic gone crazy.
3840340	3843420	Come on, Noel, Gus and chat says, Loki's body is ready.
3843420	3845140	Oh yeah, I'm, I wasn't ready.
3845140	3848780	I've been waiting for this trailer and I, I was like, I was checking the internet and
3848780	3851380	checking Twitter and shit like all day long on Saturday.
3851380	3852500	I'm like, okay, when's this thing?
3852500	3853500	When is it?
3853500	3854500	When is it?
3854500	3855500	And I saw it.
3855500	3856500	I'm like, fuck yes.
3856500	3857500	I'm watching that.
3857500	3858860	And I was at depth and chat says, can you really tell what the story's about with that
3858860	3859860	trailer?
3859860	3862820	Well, it, to be fair, it's a teaser, not a trailer, but it's a teaser.
3862820	3867460	It's still, I mean, um, no, probably not from that.
3867460	3870820	They didn't really explain what it was if it was just a teaser.
3870820	3874260	But I mean, being that I've read the book, I know what the story's about.
3874580	3879140	Um, did you see now just quickly, some of the other stuff like Dar Sakra, I know, uh,
3879140	3880380	aren't you a fan of Ms. Marvel?
3880380	3882420	Didn't we get the first look at her today or yesterday?
3882420	3883420	I hadn't looked yet.
3883420	3885900	Oh, you should look, let me know what you think.
3885900	3887540	I'd be curious.
3887540	3893660	I watched, um, a few of the other trailers, but I didn't really watch very many.
3893660	3896740	I'm kind of waiting for the hype to die down and then I'll make my own decision.
3896740	3899520	I just so rarely get out to movies anymore.
3899520	3900700	It's just a bummer.
3900700	3902900	I need to see more, but I just never do.
3902900	3903900	Oh, well.
3903940	3905580	I did watch an odd trailer.
3905580	3906580	What'd you see?
3906580	3911020	For, I don't even know if the movie's already out or not, but it's called Cooties.
3911020	3914420	I really liked the trailer for what's the Oprah movie.
3914420	3915420	The Oprah-
3915420	3916420	Oh, Wrinkle in Time.
3916420	3917420	Yes, the Wrinkle in Time.
3917420	3918420	The Oprah movie.
3918420	3919420	Oprah's in it.
3919420	3923780	And it had the Eurythmics cover in the trailer that I actually, I had to go find it on Spotify
3923780	3924780	because I was like, all right.
3924780	3925780	I couldn't find it.
3925780	3926780	I tried.
3926780	3929060	It is, it is on the soundtrack to the movie Sucker Punch, believe it or not.
3929060	3930060	It's a different one.
3930060	3932140	The one that they have in that trailer is not the same.
3932140	3934260	Everyone says it is that one, but it's different.
3934260	3935260	Oh, I thought it was the-
3935260	3936660	No, I've listened to both of them.
3936660	3937780	It's a completely different-
3937780	3940060	Maybe she remade it again.
3940060	3941060	It's different.
3941060	3942060	Yeah.
3942060	3943060	Interesting.
3943060	3944060	But this Cooties movie is weird.
3944060	3949500	It has Elijah Wood in it and it's about child zombies that apparently-
3949500	3951060	Not another zombie movie.
3951060	3955420	They're apparently only susceptible to whatever it is if you haven't gone through puberty.
3955420	3956420	Oh, my bad.
3956420	3957420	That's right.
3957420	3958420	Act F says it was D23.
3958420	3959420	Sorry, that was last week's news.
3959420	3960420	My bad.
3960420	3961420	My bad.
3961420	3962420	We'll allow it.
3962420	3963420	We'll allow it.
3963420	3964420	We'll allow it.
3964420	3965420	We'll allow it.
3965420	3966420	Blow us together.
3966420	3967420	All right.
3967420	3968420	I did watch all the Marvel trailers and I watched the DC trailers as well.
3968420	3969420	I'm still not hyped about Justice League.
3969420	3970420	I'm sorry.
3970420	3974740	I'm just, maybe I'm not, well, I am not a DC fan, but like, but you know what, though?
3974740	3979180	If they're smart and when Joss Whedon took over, he just made it Wonder Woman too, but
3979180	3980180	we'll see.
3980180	3983180	No, Wonder Woman had a great part in it and that stuff looked neat.
3983180	3986700	It's just, I'm not still just on board with like, it wasn't the same as like the Avengers
3986700	3987700	like this.
3987700	3989300	I'm just like, I don't fucking care.
3989300	3990600	It's kind of what it is.
3990600	3994760	But like, holy shit, the Lego movies though, they're fucking knocking that shit out of
3994760	3998200	the park because they had a new trailer for the Ninjago movie.
3998200	3999200	Fucking hilarious.
3999200	4003720	Just the humor that they have in those movies, they're just fantastic.
4003720	4004720	So they have that.
4004720	4008480	And of course the new Thor Ragnarok trailer looks awesome.
4008480	4015220	And then I watched the bootleg of the Avengers infinity war trailer, which looks pretty cool.
4015220	4016220	Hope they release that adventure.
4016220	4017540	I don't know why they do that.
4017540	4018540	Like hold it back.
4018540	4024060	They're waiting for Thor Ragnarok to come out or some weird, but, um, yeah, it all looks
4024060	4025060	good.
4025060	4027580	Um, trying to win else defenders though.
4027580	4028580	That's another one too.
4028580	4032620	I don't give a shit about like, I didn't, I've never gotten into the Netflix stuff,
4032620	4035280	but I'm just like, yeah, I really don't want to see that.
4035280	4038780	But stranger things too is, I'm on board for that.
4038780	4040260	I was already on board for that.
4040260	4044000	So, all right, well we could talk about more movies and TVs, but we need to get back to
4044000	4045000	games.
4045000	4047140	Uh, dark soccer has some shakeup and gaming, right?
4047140	4048140	Yep.
4048740	4053380	And I'm honestly not terribly surprised by it, but, um, BioWare's, uh, general manager,
4053380	4058420	Aaron Flynn, who's been there for 17 years is leaving.
4058420	4065840	And to replace him is another former BioWare employee who went off to Microsoft and is
4065840	4074000	now coming back, uh, Casey Hudson, which basically it was Hudson's interest in returning that
4074000	4075820	led to Flynn making the final decision.
4075820	4080840	Of course, that's what it says, but you know, everybody's reading into this.
4080840	4085360	Was Mass Effect Andromeda that bad?
4085360	4087900	Perhaps that unsupported.
4087900	4094120	And if it were me on a project that, you know, that I had hoped would be treated better,
4094120	4097660	I'd probably leave too, cause you know, that's just gotta be a blow.
4097660	4103920	I mean, this guy was also, uh, if I'm right, like the lead programmer for Dragon Age Origins
4103920	4104920	and Mass Effect 2.
4105020	4107340	No, he was the director of programming.
4107340	4114420	So, you know, two series, you know, and he was also a general manager, of course, while
4114420	4116940	Dragon Age Inquisition was going on in Mass Effect 3.
4116940	4122440	So I mean, he's had his fingers in the pie for a long time.
4122440	4126700	Dungeon Buster in chat says, as one comment I read about on the BioWare news went, someone
4126700	4128380	had to fall on their sword.
4128380	4129380	Okay.
4129380	4130380	But here's my question.
4130380	4132660	Who at EA is taking a hit?
4132660	4137840	Because I'm sorry, EA needs blame in that what happened with Andromeda needs some big
4137840	4141840	time blame, but that's, that's just my thoughts.
4141840	4142840	Yeah.
4142840	4144640	It is what it is.
4144640	4145640	All right.
4145640	4148880	Well, let's hope the Mass Effect series can maybe recover and maybe with Casey Hudson
4148880	4152940	at the helm, maybe he's willing to give this series a shot and maybe we'll really advocate
4152940	4153940	for it.
4153940	4156040	Cause it is something he was heavily involved in the original trilogy.
4156040	4157040	Who knows?
4157040	4158040	Who knows?
4158040	4159040	We'll see.
4159040	4160040	All right.
4160040	4161040	Well, moving on.
4161040	4162040	Uh, we got some more news.
4162620	4168760	So Nintendo released their app, um, just before the launch of Splatoon 2 to basically handle
4168760	4171700	their online portion of the Switch.
4171700	4175660	So they have the Nintendo Switch online app and you can use it for a bunch of things for
4175660	4180300	Splatoon 2, for example, like, uh, matchmaking, uh, game invites.
4180300	4184300	They're even having some sort of, uh, voice chat system.
4184300	4191460	However, the voice chat, of course, as we've seen the setup before with the headsets that
4191460	4194840	were coming out is not necessarily the most elegant solution.
4194840	4199640	You have to basically hook your Switch and your phone up to a splitter and hook that
4199640	4202680	up to a headset and hope that all works.
4202680	4208480	On top of that though, their app has some really funky issues with it.
4208480	4215860	So for example, when you're on voice chat, you'll disconnect if, you know, for example,
4215860	4220920	another application comes up or it'll restart in the same room.
4220920	4226000	If you open, um, I guess it'll restart once you open it up again.
4226000	4230940	But I guess if it's, the app is in the background, it just disconnects unlike a lot of other
4230940	4231940	things.
4231940	4234220	The other thing too is the app won't work if your phone goes in the power saving sleep
4234220	4235220	mode.
4235220	4239140	So if your screen is inactive, it will shut off, which is fantastic because then now you
4239140	4242180	have to have your phone charging all the time in order for it to work.
4242180	4246220	In my opinion, that is the biggest, dumbest oversight in the whole thing is the fact that
4246220	4248500	when you go into sleep mode, the thing kicks you off.
4248500	4254160	I mean, come on, it's, it's weird.
4254160	4260760	I mean, I don't understand why, why they can't just allow it to shut the screen or better
4260760	4264720	yet, like if you're in chat mode or something like that, have the screen black out.
4264720	4268760	Like Pokemon go does that where like you can leave your phone open, but if you turn your
4268760	4273120	phone upside down, it blacks the whole screen and yeah, saves a little power.
4273120	4275280	Yeah, it's just, it's stupid.
4275280	4281540	Uh, yeah, and I just, again, the app, I tried using the app at least for some of the other
4281540	4285220	stuff cause you can go into the splat net or whatever and you can see like, here's my
4285220	4288460	last few scores and you can, this is the weird thing.
4288460	4293540	You can buy things on the app that are different from the rotations that are in the game live.
4293540	4296620	So I guess like a little perk to using the app or something.
4296620	4297620	I don't know.
4297620	4301060	I shouldn't have to, well, shouldn't have to use the app in the first place.
4301060	4302740	It's a little weird, but it's there.
4302740	4309520	But I mean, other than that stuff, like what is, what is stopping me from using discord
4309520	4310520	or Skype?
4310520	4311520	There's really nothing.
4311520	4312520	It's actually probably better.
4312520	4314020	Oh my God.
4314020	4315640	Discord should be having a field day right now.
4315640	4320800	That that system is blowing up, which by the way, cheap plug, vog network discord is also
4320800	4324360	where actually the next person to join is going to be our 50th member on discord.
4324360	4325500	So I'm pretty excited about that.
4325500	4328000	So it's over a vog network.com slash discord.
4328860	4332820	But anyway, I mean, discord's really blowing up all over the place.
4332820	4336980	And now, you know, now it's going to be a possible solution for a lot of people for
4336980	4342200	Nintendo's failure to produce a competent app when it comes to voice chatting, which
4342200	4345780	I guess, you know, they can always update it and try to make it better, but good Lord.
4345780	4347900	Like, okay, I get it.
4347900	4349140	Here's my, my problem.
4349140	4354300	Like I thought the whole idea of having to have an app for online was stupid, but if
4354300	4357860	they can make it work, then cool.
4357860	4362240	And it sounds like they're just, it's like, this is like rookie shit that they're fucking
4362240	4367400	didn't think, Oh, Hey, maybe we should get it to work when the phone goes to sleep or
4367400	4368400	have it run in the background.
4368400	4369400	Or I don't know.
4369400	4372480	It's like, do they not know how to, do they outsource this shit?
4372480	4375000	I mean, do they not know how to fix this?
4375000	4376520	I mean, I ding, ding, ding.
4376520	4379880	I think we have a winner, but anyway, I would think that they'd be able to patch this in,
4379880	4383540	so hopefully they can fix it, but it's just stupid.
4383540	4389520	It's not, when people aren't very confident in your ability to handle online and you pull
4389520	4393720	this shit, it doesn't help the argument for you.
4393720	4398120	Dungeon buster and chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, Nintendo friend code team.
4398120	4401160	We made things a little difficult for players to get together.
4401160	4406200	Nintendo mobile team, hold our beer.
4406200	4407840	And the friend code thing, let's be honest.
4407840	4409520	I still don't get that.
4409520	4416060	I mean, can we get to the point now where we understand that like, there's, is that
4416060	4418540	really preventing anything with friend codes?
4418540	4423220	I mean, like I, there's for what it, for what it's worth, which isn't much, but for what
4423220	4427260	it's worth, it's not what it used to be in on the Nintendo Wii.
4427260	4431020	Like when you find somebody's friend code, you send them a friend request.
4431020	4433820	Like it's not one of those, like you both have to add each other or you'll never know
4433820	4434820	that.
4434820	4442480	It sends a traditional request and you can pull in friends from the Wii U, the 3DS, the
4442480	4445000	Miitomo and like other mobile stuff.
4445000	4451360	You can pull in your friends list from those games, but it is weird how the mobile games,
4451360	4455560	those mobile games like Miitomo will go to your Twitter and Facebook lists, but your
4455560	4457200	Switch will not.
4457200	4461240	And I think that just goes to show there's some type of teams not talking to each other
4461240	4463200	or outsource stuff going on here.
4463200	4465820	Like why is it possible over here, but not possible over here?
4465820	4469060	It's weird, but it's not as bad.
4469060	4473500	Like, you know, I know Nintendo gets a lot of shit for friend codes as they should, but
4473500	4475540	uh, it's not what it was on the Nintendo Wii.
4475540	4476540	It's come a long way since then.
4476540	4480460	I just think people don't care because like you have, once again, parents let their kids
4480460	4482300	play fucking Call of Duty and shit.
4482300	4485300	Do you think they really care who their child is online?
4485300	4486740	I mean, I don't know.
4486740	4488380	Well they, or they should, they should pay attention.
4488380	4489380	I don't know.
4489380	4492940	Well, anyway, I guess you could always go back to the classic days of the SNES, which
4492940	4496480	a lot of people are trying to do because of the Super Nintendo classic.
4496480	4501600	And uh, turns out my phone blew up with notifications the other night because Walmart put those
4501600	4502600	fuckers up for pre-order.
4502600	4507200	Uh, the Super NES classic supposed to be released on September 29th, it's going to cost 80 bucks
4507200	4511600	and Walmart put them up for pre-order and of course they're gone.
4511600	4513200	But I would, I will give them this credit.
4513200	4515000	It took a good 20 minutes or so.
4515000	4520800	Yeah, I had set up notifications for that, but I didn't see my phone in time and my phone
4520800	4521800	was charging.
4521860	4527140	I was out at dinner and I know shock and awe you guys, sometimes at dinner, I turn my phone
4527140	4528620	over and I don't look at it.
4528620	4529620	Sometimes.
4529620	4530620	Casp.
4530620	4531620	I don't know.
4531620	4534440	This was one of those times where I was like, you know, if they're going to make it so difficult
4534440	4537300	for me to buy one of those systems, I'm just not going to get one.
4537300	4541100	And that is exactly, if Nintendo wants me to buy one, I will.
4541100	4542820	And I said that a few weeks ago and I'm sticking to it.
4542820	4548340	Cause honestly this, this product to me seems like, like the, um, you know, Atari flashbacks
4548340	4550040	and new stuff of that sort.
4550060	4551900	It's more of like an impulse buy.
4551900	4555780	I think, I mean, a lot of people really want it, but I think, you know, if they weren't
4555780	4559340	so hard to get, people wouldn't be clamoring as much.
4559340	4560340	I don't know.
4560340	4565100	Uh, well over at Target, uh, which I didn't really want to buy anything at Walmart anyway.
4565100	4568940	So when I hear about their competitor Target, I'm like, okay, well target I can handle.
4568940	4570780	Uh, somebody actually tweeted target.
4570780	4573260	When can I get a SNES classic?
4573260	4577480	Target did reply saying we expect to carry SNES in stores and online, but we don't have
4577480	4579300	any info regarding pre-orders.
4579320	4584440	So they may or may not be taking pre-orders and I guess this was a follow up to an earlier
4584440	4588120	tweet they said, where they said, good news, we'll have this item and it will be available
4588120	4591440	for pre-orders, but it sounds like Target and their support team there that's working
4591440	4593960	on Twitter and doesn't really have a consistent answer for that.
4593960	4600640	And conspiracy theorists myself, um, I would like to say that I noticed that, Hmm, well
4600640	4605080	this bad news about your online app sucking, let's let out some of those pre-orders.
4605080	4608540	So we get the websites covering that instead.
4608600	4610240	And that, Oh, Hey, the SNES classic was out there.
4610240	4611560	It's got the positive spin out there.
4611560	4612560	Interesting.
4612560	4616060	And now no one's talking about the online app sucking.
4616060	4621000	I don't think, I think there it's, it's too much of a negative and a positive.
4621000	4624720	You've seen the reviews for that online app in the stores, like on iTunes and on Google
4624720	4631400	play, people are, people are not nice, but at the same time, it's not a nice app.
4631400	4638320	So I can't, you know, there's appropriate ways to take out your anger, throwing a shoe
4638340	4641740	at a stage to some woman who's just contracted to be there.
4641740	4643860	That's probably not one of the ways you should do it.
4643860	4649300	Um, but I suppose a review on a site like iTunes, um, may be effective.
4649300	4656300	You know, Nintendo's got to look at that two star rating and go, Hmm, that doesn't, we
4656300	4657900	got two stars.
4657900	4658900	Wow.
4658900	4659900	All right.
4659900	4662940	Anyhow, let's move on dark soccer.
4663160	4672580	Well, um, we were at one time World of Warcraft players and have played other, I would say
4672580	4677000	Blizzard games, but this one is a little bit surprising.
4677000	4682640	Um, Blizzard actually laid off, uh, Russell Brower, I guess that's how you say his last
4682640	4683640	name.
4683640	4690640	Um, who was, uh, the senior audio director and composer who's worked on a World of Warcraft,
4690660	4697020	Overwatch, Starcraft two, Diablo three, Hearthstone, and all kinds of things he put on his Facebook
4697020	4706020	that, um, and would there being some adjustments within the company that his position was made,
4706020	4714620	uh, redundant, it, it was eliminated, um, which I suppose is a big shock.
4714620	4718380	I mean, for a lot of people, he's had his, you know, his fingers in a lot of Blizzard
4718380	4726560	projects and, um, I mean, I would, they might have him freelance, I don't know, but still
4726560	4729720	that's just kind of crappy.
4729720	4730720	Actually it's a lot crappy.
4730720	4731720	Yeah.
4731720	4734600	I mean, it's kind of, it's kind of painful to hear that when you think about like what
4734600	4738240	great music World of Warcraft had, like I will still always love like the Grizzly Hills,
4738240	4741240	like when you go into that zone for the first time, that's an amazing song.
4741240	4744160	And, you know, obviously there's a lot of, you know, big, big stuff for World of Warcraft.
4744160	4748180	So it's, it's sad to hear about that, but I mean, it kind of sounds like the door is
4748180	4751520	open where it's like, well, he's not a full time employee, but he can still, it doesn't
4751520	4757640	mean that like, it doesn't sound like it ended ugly, like, um, like the halo, the guy who
4757640	4761280	did the halo song for Bungie, it sounds like that didn't end so well.
4761280	4764700	But this one sounds a little more like, well, the door's open, so maybe there's freelance
4764700	4771560	in the future, but maybe be nice and we'll give you a big parting bonus or it's in like
4771560	4773360	some work disclosure.
4773660	4778500	Uh, Slykic from Game Buoy is in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com saying, Blizzard
4778500	4782900	did a Heroes of the Storm themed employee outing at Medieval Times in Buena Park.
4782900	4784620	They put on a special show for them.
4784620	4785620	Did you hear that?
4785620	4787420	Yeah, I heard, I saw that on Twitter actually.
4787420	4790020	So Blizzard does things like that for the employees sometimes.
4790020	4793780	They also did, they, one night they did, um, this is a couple of years ago, but I remember
4793780	4799100	hearing after BlizzCon, they rented the World of Color thing at Disney California Venture
4799100	4801420	and they did like a Blizzard World of Color.
4801480	4807200	But it was just like, it wasn't anything, it was like their trailers on the water screen.
4807200	4809560	It wasn't like they didn't go out of their way to do a bunch of effects.
4809560	4812360	But still, for employees, it's got to be really exciting.
4812360	4814400	It is pretty crazy.
4814400	4815400	Thank you, RageNator.
4815400	4816400	Martin O'Donnell is a Halo composer.
4816400	4818040	Yeah, I heard it didn't end well between him and Bungie.
4818040	4822000	I remember that came up on the show a while ago, but, um, yeah, or actually it was Activision
4822000	4824000	more, but anyway.
4824000	4825000	All right.
4825000	4828400	Uh, let's, uh, let's move on.
4828400	4831900	Just got a couple more stories for you guys before we get to the classic game of the week,
4831900	4832900	Loki.
4832900	4833900	I don't get this.
4833900	4839100	This is kind of stupid, but, um, you know, there's this whole Overwatch league, um, that,
4839100	4843660	you know, it's their esports league that they were trying to trademark their logo, which
4843660	4849740	has Tracer and it's kind of like, you know, the multicolored logos you see for like several
4849740	4850740	sports franchises.
4850740	4856340	And well, one of those sports franchises, Major League Baseball, is saying, hey, it's
4856340	4858440	too similar to our logo.
4858440	4860320	You can't trademark this.
4860320	4864800	So they filed an appeal, but they haven't, they filed an extension on their appeal, but
4864800	4867840	they haven't yet filed an appeal for it and the deadline's actually coming up in about
4867840	4868840	three days.
4868840	4873420	But it doesn't look anything like the fucking Major League Baseball logo and besides on
4873420	4879080	top of that, I think if you have any qualms against any sort of logo like that, then what
4879080	4880640	about Major League Gaming?
4880640	4882760	I mean, come on.
4882760	4884600	That's more of a rip off of that than anything.
4884600	4887460	And they're like, what about the NBA has the same type of thing or NHL?
4887460	4891660	I mean, there's like a ton of fucking logos out there that look all the same.
4891660	4898380	It is also pretty clear to me that in one logo, the person is holding a baseball bat
4898380	4901460	and the other logo, the person is holding a gun.
4901460	4903100	It's also different colors.
4903100	4904740	It's also different fonts.
4904740	4909220	Also the, the way the words are lined up is different.
4909220	4912620	It's just sounds like, hmm, up and coming popular.
4912640	4914160	Is MLB afraid of something?
4914160	4916360	Yeah, I think so.
4916360	4917360	Sounds like it.
4917360	4922760	After all, we had Evo on ESPN on Sunday night.
4922760	4924920	They're pulling higher numbers in some of their games.
4924920	4928120	So just, I don't know, just, just theorize.
4928120	4930640	I guess we'll have to follow and see what happens with this.
4930640	4935480	Hopefully they won't file any sort of, um, appeal.
4935480	4939900	So they're, like I said, the deadline for their submission has to be the 26th.
4939900	4944780	And so if they don't file anything, then there's no opposition and they're going to basically
4944780	4946960	just allow them to have that.
4946960	4947960	All right.
4947960	4952000	Well, a little more for you here before we get to the classic game of the week, but this
4952000	4955800	is about a classic game and this all seems to be happening all at once.
4955800	4960520	I don't know if this is because of the Castlevania and how well that's been doing on Netflix,
4960520	4963160	but Jason mentioned at the intro at the top of the show tonight, there's been kind of
4963160	4965000	a flood of this media stuff this week.
4965000	4966620	And yeah, there has been.
4966620	4970340	Get this, Galaga of all things.
4970340	4971340	That's right.
4971340	4975720	The old 80s Namco game, Galaga, supposed to be made into a animated series.
4975720	4976720	That's right.
4976720	4981420	Sweden, uh, an LA based production company, the Nuttery Entertainment, the Nuttery, send
4981420	4982420	them to the Nuttery.
4982420	4986800	Uh, they're developing an animated series and other extensions of the Galaga brand.
4986800	4990840	They've signed an agreement with bound by Namco, uh, which, uh, you know, obviously
4990840	4993140	made Galaga and Galaxian and all that.
4993140	4996120	They're trying to develop new characters and stories based on Galaga, including an
4996120	5000720	animated series titled Galaga Chronicles, huh?
5000720	5005420	So yeah, a quote there, we're incredibly honored to be able to work on such an amazing legacy
5005420	5008440	property and help launch it into the animated space.
5008440	5010440	So it could be interesting.
5010440	5014200	Um, Dar Sakura, I know you're a fan of Namco stuff.
5014200	5016400	Uh, would you watch a Galaga cartoon?
5016400	5017400	Sure.
5017400	5018640	I watched a Salamander anime.
5018640	5019640	Hmm.
5019640	5020640	All right.
5021640	5024660	Would you watch one based on Splatoon?
5024660	5027020	Because Splatoon is going to get one too.
5027020	5028020	What's that?
5028020	5029020	I haven't played any Splatoon.
5029020	5030020	It's cute.
5030020	5032660	I think, I think, I think Splatoon would make a good anime.
5032660	5034520	I think it's a good like kid thing.
5034520	5039740	Like I know we always taunt Nintendo at being like the kiddie company, but let's be real.
5039740	5042440	Like they made a first person, well, you know what I mean?
5042440	5044460	Over the shoulder shooter or whatever you want to call it.
5044460	5046800	That isn't really a shooter, but it is.
5046800	5051480	And it's a game that's like really fun for adults and kids can get into it.
5051480	5055080	So it's not overly violent and I don't see any faults there now.
5055080	5058260	No, I mean, so like, yeah, Nintendo kind of hit the money on this.
5058260	5062040	So it makes a lot of sense that Splatoon is going to get an anime spinoff.
5062040	5067080	Uh, it is being reported by Korokoro that the series will premiere on the Korokoro YouTube
5067080	5069720	page on August 12th.
5069720	5073280	There already is a Splatoon manga in magazine form.
5073280	5076760	So it just makes sense that the anime is going to follow suit.
5076760	5078480	There had been one for Metroid back in the day.
5078480	5082520	Oh, they made a manga for Metroid.
5082520	5086800	That a lot of the story points from the manga ended up in like super Metroid and some of
5086800	5088840	the other Metroid games.
5088840	5092800	Well then it could be interesting to see what develops with, uh, especially with how popular
5092800	5095080	some of those Splatoon characters are really popular.
5095080	5097960	Like seriously, just look up Pearl and Marina.
5097960	5104600	Well, the, the NES version of Strider was based off of a manga based off the arcade
5104600	5105600	version.
5105600	5106600	Right.
5106640	5110680	Because that's why the Sega and Nintendo ones, even though they're both Strider are so different.
5110680	5111680	Exactly.
5111680	5112680	Excellent.
5112680	5118760	Uh, anyhow, uh, well it may not be Metroid, but another classic game, uh, again, sounds
5118760	5121920	like it's moving forward, is a Mega Man movie.
5121920	5125800	Now, we first heard about this two years ago, but some movement happened.
5125800	5127360	It's not in development hell anymore.
5127360	5130260	It's in the final stages of negotiations to write and direct.
5130260	5134280	Sharon in entertainment, I hope I'm saying that right, is the producer behind this.
5134280	5142880	The directors of the catfish film, we'll be heading up the project, but heroes actor
5142880	5147360	Masi Oka, who played like that, uh, what was his name in heroes?
5147360	5148360	Hero.
5148360	5149360	Hero.
5149360	5150360	Okay.
5150360	5151360	Thank you.
5151360	5153120	I just remember he was the guy in the trailer in Times Square going, I did it.
5153120	5156040	Honestly, he was one of the best parts of George Takei played his dad.
5156040	5157040	Yeah.
5157040	5158040	Yeah.
5158040	5161320	Like the key was, he was the hero in that show, literally.
5161320	5165360	But anyway, uh, so he's involved with that, which I remember that was because he had done,
5165360	5166720	he wasn't always an actor.
5166720	5170640	Well, I guess that was always something he kind of did, but he was like a sci-fi, uh,
5170640	5172280	FX guy before that.
5172280	5173280	Wasn't he?
5173280	5174280	I still remember reading about that.
5174280	5175280	Yeah.
5175280	5178360	I think he made that transition from that to like doing the acting in that show.
5178360	5180520	And then obviously he was very popular in that show.
5180520	5185400	Anyway, no idea when the film itself will be coming out, but I'm sure plenty more information
5185400	5186400	will be out there.
5186400	5190480	Uh, so it doesn't suck like the cartoon looks cause that cartoon looks like shit.
5190480	5192200	Is that cartoon even come out yet?
5192200	5197480	I thought we saw trailers, but why don't we have seen trailers for, but I thought it was
5197480	5198480	early 2018 for that.
5198480	5199480	I don't know.
5199480	5200480	All right.
5200480	5201480	All right.
5201480	5202480	Well, anyhow.
5202480	5203480	Well, it looks weird.
5203480	5204480	I was just like, sorry.
5204480	5205480	Just interrupt again.
5205480	5215160	Um, we have all these like, oh yeah, movies and cartoon game, game, anywhere it's like
5215160	5217080	fucking hot topic in invader Zim.
5217080	5220160	Oh, let's put out all the fucking invaders in merchandise, but fuck you.
5220160	5224920	We're not giving you another show until of course new Nintendo Rocko's modern life fucking
5224920	5231720	trailer for that looks awesome, but yeah, I mean the movie is nice.
5231720	5234780	I guess it's good to test the waters to see if it's something to bring back.
5234780	5237440	I think Mark Rocco's modern life would be good in invader Zim.
5237440	5238880	I'm all for that.
5238880	5239880	Come on.
5239880	5240880	No Gus.
5240880	5243920	In our chat over at live.vognetware.com says I want to kid Icarus reboot so that I can
5243920	5246120	cosplay as eggplant wizard.
5246120	5249240	A you can already cosplay as eggplant wizard if you want.
5249240	5251080	I think the eggplant wizard was iconic enough.
5251080	5252080	Okay.
5252080	5253080	Eggplant wizard was in captain in, right?
5253080	5254080	If I remember, right?
5254080	5255080	Uh, yes.
5255080	5256080	I think so.
5256080	5257080	Yes.
5257080	5258080	It also was iconic enough for the game and was also terrible.
5258080	5261720	But B I just want to remind you the eggplant wizard and the eggplant emoji have nothing
5261720	5262720	in common.
5262720	5265600	So just if that's where you're going with that, just, just, just a little word of caution
5265600	5269600	for the eggplant wizard to be a perfect character for another smash game.
5269600	5270600	I think so.
5270600	5273760	I think the eggplant wizard would be, I think, I think, I think that the eggplant wizard
5273800	5274800	is a good character.
5274800	5275800	And the dude from Actraiser.
5275800	5276800	Do, do for a comeback.
5276800	5277800	Yes.
5277800	5278800	Dude from Actraiser.
5278800	5280520	Uh, eggplant wizard.
5280520	5283680	We need to, maybe this is a list list we need to do in the future.
5283680	5287360	The, the character that's due for a fucking comeback.
5287360	5289640	Just like we had Duck Hunt, right?
5289640	5292360	We had that fucking dog came back in smash.
5292360	5293680	Character due for a comeback via smash.
5293680	5295240	How about another Duck Hunt game?
5295240	5298160	There's all these properties they can bring back.
5298160	5299280	Yeah.
5299280	5300840	I like that.
5300840	5303080	We're going to do that on a future show I think.
5303080	5304080	Character due for a comeback.
5304080	5308320	In fact, if you're going to see NES classic edition two, I would be happy, I mean, I don't
5308320	5312360	know how they would do a light gun game, but it would be cool to see with the zapper in
5312360	5314160	there and have all the light gun games in there.
5314160	5315160	All right.
5315160	5319120	Let's travel back to a simpler time when we were playing games that featured eggplants
5319120	5321040	and there was nothing wrong with that.
5321040	5324000	The classic game of the week.
5324000	5328960	Dark soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey,
5328960	5334440	brat, play this game or I'll turn you into an eggplant.
5334440	5335440	Sorry, Sakura.
5335440	5336440	What is it?
5336440	5338000	Eggplants are kind of good though, actually.
5338000	5340840	I actually make eggplant parmesan really nicely.
5340840	5345440	My grandmother used to make it for me, so believe it or not, I have a lot of fond memories
5345440	5346440	attached to eggplants.
5346440	5347440	You know what I'm saying?
5347440	5348440	It's one of those things...
5348440	5350120	Sorry, I can't help it.
5350120	5351120	It's one of those things that people...
5351120	5352120	Not those kind of memories.
5352120	5357520	It's one of those things that people love or they hate, but I find that I really like
5357520	5358520	eggplant.
5359080	5360080	Go figure.
5360080	5363080	Okay, eggplant emoji.
5363080	5364080	Classic game of the week.
5364080	5365080	Dark Sakura.
5365080	5367080	What should the kids be playing this week?
5367080	5373920	Senkoku or as it was in Japan, Senkoku Densho, which was a legacy of the Warring States to
5373920	5374920	translate.
5374920	5376200	Oh, it's a Neo Geo game.
5376200	5378560	I love the Neo Geo startup logo.
5378560	5379560	That's right.
5379560	5380560	Let's have a moment.
5380560	5381560	Rob, start it over.
5381560	5382560	We just heard it.
5382560	5383560	Do it.
5383560	5384560	Fine.
5384560	5385560	Jamie made me.
5388520	5394160	I hear that every time I turn on my Neo Geo.
5394160	5397560	Everybody now.
5397560	5399120	Sweet relief.
5399120	5406880	Anyways, Senkoku actually was a series of games that were put out by SNK.
5406880	5412480	It had several different ports and releases that came out.
5412480	5417560	The original, of course, was for the Neo Geo arcade system.
5417600	5419880	And that also means that we had...
5419880	5431280	So then that was also the Neo Geo AVS, MVS, Neo Geo CD, Mega CD, and Super Famicom versions
5431280	5434200	that apparently were...
5434200	5436840	Some of them were canceled in North America.
5436840	5442280	The arcade version was rereleased as SNK Arcade Classics Volume 1 in part of it.
5442280	5447720	And the Neo Geo version was rereleased for Virtual Console in 2001 with the sequels also
5447720	5454480	coming to Virtual Console, Senkoku 2, Senkoku 3 for US and PAL regions.
5454480	5459200	And then in 2009 for PS2 and Windows, there was Senkoku Anthology.
5459200	5468640	So basically, I like this game and I had forgotten about it until I watched a video review yesterday.
5468640	5473200	It almost kind of makes me think of Samurai Troopers.
5473200	5475200	You remember that anime?
5475200	5478880	Over here we got it as Ronin Warriors.
5478880	5487880	It kind of makes me think a little bit of it because you have this dark undead dimension
5487880	5497960	that's still based in feudal Japan, or at least the mythology around it is, who come
5497960	5501200	to the modern world or the dimension train at crossover.
5501200	5510840	And your two heroes are a ninja named Dave, in the US version, or in the Neo Geo version,
5510840	5517680	and a cowboy named Keld, although in the SNES one, they were Dan and Bill respectively,
5517680	5526880	who were descendants of the original samurai who banished the asshole warlord back when.
5526880	5534320	So you start off with six health points, and then after you beat certain enemies, you
5534320	5540640	get these powerful forms that you can transform into, that you can toggle which one you go
5540640	5544880	into, although in the SNES one you can't.
5544880	5551240	You've got a wolf form, you have a ninja form, you have a samurai form, and they've got their
5551240	5554440	own special power-ups that go on along with the game.
5554440	5562880	But the neat thing about this game is that you can hit these warp areas that take you
5562880	5570920	from a modern day, or by modern I mean 1991 setting, and send you into this mythical feudal
5570920	5575360	Japanese setting.
5575360	5580320	Banners broken in the background, and even the music changes, and the music in this game
5580320	5581600	is freaking great.
5581600	5586760	It actually has one of my favorite game soundtracks.
5586760	5590520	And on top of that, one of the things in the arcade version is that there is a reference
5590520	5596600	to the game Athena, where- Neo Geo has a lot of subtle references to that game, it really
5596600	5597600	do.
5597600	5598600	Well, it was another SNK game.
5598600	5599960	Yeah, no, I know, I know, it was like one of their first, yeah.
5599960	5605560	But it even has dress shop Athena, and it's in the Athena font, with a schoolgirl dressed
5605560	5609360	on a mannequin in the background, it's pretty cool.
5609360	5614240	So anyway, as you go through the game, you have to survive being attacked by the enemies
5614240	5615960	and collect your power-ups.
5615960	5622600	Five green orbs will heal one health point, and a red orb will give you a single sword,
5622600	5628640	a cyan one will give you a double sword, and the purple one gives you a two-handed holy
5628640	5636440	sword, and a yellow one will give you a magic attack.
5636440	5644800	And now here's the bad thing, as much as I would love to love on the SNES one, it actually
5644800	5651000	suffers from a lot of the limitations of having a slower processor.
5651000	5655640	On top of that, the music really isn't all that great, although the SNES can do a pretty
5655640	5658320	decent shakuhachi sound.
5658320	5664160	Anyway, of course the Neo Geo version is perfect, the Neo CD version is perfect.
5664160	5673320	The only thing that I remembered as being a problem with the arcade one is that it played
5673320	5679240	kind of sluggishly anyway, and of course the Super Famicom one was even worse.
5679240	5682860	Now the Mega Drive one, because I had never played the Mega Drive one, but I was watching
5682860	5691840	the review of it, and the same company that did the port of it had done plenty of other
5691840	5696200	games, and it looks like it plays fine, the music is there, the music is the arcade music
5696200	5703160	because it's Mega CD, it just doesn't have as beautiful as a color palette.
5703160	5711040	But I think the music in this game is absolutely wonderful, and the game itself, it has a lot
5711040	5716000	of good things going on for it, it just needs to be a little bit more fun to play.
5716000	5722400	But for one of those, it was really I think ambitious in terms of story, and the design
5722400	5729040	of the game, and the way that it played, and as you went through various different settings,
5729040	5731680	it's just very fascinating.
5731680	5734320	Shame it just wasn't more fun to play, that's all.
5734320	5737080	But that's the game, Sengoku Densho.
5737080	5743880	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, a Neo Geo classic, Sengoku.
5743880	5747160	Let's hear it one more time, Darkstalker, one more time, one more time.
5747160	5748160	Okay.
5748160	5761360	We just need a collection of those for bumpers, like that remixed with the old Capcom Q sound.
5761360	5764680	Yeah, all the old start-up noises, the GameCube, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.
5764680	5768360	And old Konami, dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun

5781360	5792280	with more of orange lounge radio right after this
5792280	5797360	welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio live tonight on this sunday night with episode
5797360	5805680	number 695 of our show we're just a few episodes away from 700 if you can believe it uh if
5805680	5809160	you are just joining us here live you've missed a lot of chat like earlier in the show
5809160	5813480	we were talking about the pokemon go fest and our buddy charles from the pokemon go
5813480	5817600	podcast was actually here and uh i've been talking to him a little bit on twitter even
5817600	5821520	though i obviously couldn't be here live tonight but he did want to mention that uh he did
5821520	5824800	have some videos that he took the event if you want to check that out it's over on their
5824800	5829280	facebook page so just check it out over at facebook.com slash pokemon go podcast you
5829280	5833960	can check out those videos uh in the meantime we're gonna get back into some rapid fire
5833960	5843720	news loki so here's some new fodder for nintendo to dmca um smit there's a smash brothers fan
5843720	5849520	game called super clash brothers it basically takes the characters in smash brothers and
5849520	5854720	puts them in their wonderful 8 and 16 bit iterations and then of course there's a whole
5854720	5858840	game based on that so this one they've only got a few characters so far you've got mario
5858840	5866760	luigi princess peach link sonic tales knuckles and mega man and of course you know every
5866760	5871480	character looks just like their you know sprite versions and i think even operates sort of
5871480	5877440	like their sprite versions as well so it's available to check out online until of course
5877440	5883520	it is um you know taken down by nintendo eventually so that would be terrible um the other fun
5883520	5890720	thing there's a new mod for link to the past allows two people to share items online so
5890720	5896640	i guess it's somehow it it adds some some special code to allow a couple players to
5896640	5904040	actually coordinate items through the progress of the game and can change each other's inventory
5904040	5911160	that's kind of kind of weird um and they're saying that even i guess you can communicate
5911160	5917920	with your teams over skype and stuff um that's definitely a unique mod for that too bad it's
5917920	5924080	not like co-op though in zelda that'd be pretty cool yeah it's kind of a bummer they don't
5924080	5927360	like officially release something like that that's like when they like put multiplayer
5927360	5931320	in skyrim with a mod you know something that people kind of wanted but bethesda didn't
5931320	5936920	i guess think the balance would work right but at modders to the rescue right yeah so
5937160	5943160	neat well uh maybe uh maybe ubisoft will be looking at a zelda-like game on the nintendo
5943160	5947320	switch who knows what they're working on we don't know but ubisoft has said that they are working
5947320	5951800	on more titles for nintendo switch this is during a recent earnings call but of course no more
5951800	5956440	details just that the games will be announced soon we don't know if they're ports we don't know if
5956440	5961080	they're new games all together or like you know new uh platforms for games that are scheduled
5961080	5965800	to come out like maybe the south park game but that's you know obviously i'm i'm totally making
5965800	5970520	shit up right now um but we'll see we'll find out i would imagine gamescom might be a good time in
5970520	5975000	the near future to announce that stuff obviously i would imagine yeah ubisoft has a lot of operations
5975000	5980440	in france uh so that's only a few weeks away yeah so that'll be a good time but we'll see we'll see
5980440	5986440	uh but that would make a lot of sense uh also could the end of me verse be coming um i guess
5986440	5990280	it would make a lot of sense after all since the wii u has kind of been kicked to the curb at this
5990280	5996360	point nintendo did do an update to the wii u this update contains text now keep in mind this text
5996360	6000200	is not displayed on the screen somebody's gone through the files and found this that says the
6000200	6004680	me verse service has ended me verse and any software features that make use of me verse
6004680	6009080	are now unavailable again nintendo has announced anything official yet it's just it seems like the
6009080	6013560	wording is in there in their most recent software updates that's really all we know right now
6013560	6019800	but again i mean it kind of makes sense that it would go away except it's it's on the 3ds as well
6019800	6024600	and the 3ds is still supported by me just you know break it for the wii u i want to know what
6024600	6028680	this breaks so when they get rid of this what's this going to break everything is it going to
6028680	6032440	break like mario maker i mean how does that work yeah i don't know if it breaks mario maker and
6032440	6039480	splatoon or what happens with that um and how far out is it it could be maybe this is the last major
6039480	6043400	system patch for the wii u or something and so they're putting that text in there preemptively
6043400	6052360	i don't know but again this is all still really premature so all right uh moving on dark sakura
6053400	6060280	well um we know we uh all enjoy our super mario maker at least we some of us are still giving it
6060280	6064680	the time of day yeah i did uh i did the post show stream last week was mario maker we had a lot of
6064680	6074680	fun well now um a fan has made a mario 64 maker basically um you use your camera perspective and
6074680	6080520	put things where you want and you would play them through emulation or through you know like
6080520	6090680	a rom writer or something so pretty neat um it is available um online um you just have to look it up
6091480	6099080	um and you know before someone takes it down so and in other news for folks who are fans of
6099080	6105400	ultra street fighter 2 they have released now or figured out how to play as shin akuma
6106200	6114040	or as he was in japan goki so to do this you choose you highlight color one press cancel
6114040	6118200	then choose ken highlight number uh color nine then press cancel
6118200	6124200	choose sagat highlight color eight then press cancel choose m bison highlight color seven
6124200	6129800	press cancel highlight the random select then press l and r simultaneously good lord you have
6129800	6137080	to do that each time you want to play oh oh that's fucking hell that's stupid so well it's an arcade
6137080	6141800	ish thing to do i guess no it's stupid it's an arcade thing arcade ish thing to do in an arcade
6141880	6147400	that has no sort of like static memory to know that it's updated you know an unlock or something
6147400	6155560	like that that's on capcom not nintendo that is just stupid all right well anyhow i do want to
6155560	6159480	go to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com because some interesting uh insight the me verse thing
6159480	6163800	really struck a chord with a lot of people in chat uh when we were talking about that uh jd
6163800	6169160	and chat says the my nintendo thing still gives weekly me verse check-ins i don't expect them to
6169160	6174840	disable that until they roll out switch rewards on my nintendo uh act dev points out there's a me
6174840	6183160	verse stage in smash wii u so uh let's see uh also in chat at live.vognetwork.com dark tetsuya
6183160	6188040	theorizes maybe it'll tie into nintendo's new online maybe have a me verse style service on
6188040	6192920	switch well what's interesting to see if you haven't already seen splatoon 2 kind of built
6192920	6197160	its own me verse within the game and that's where you're seeing a lot of these pictures that look a
6197160	6202200	lot like me verse show up but they're just kind of embedded in splatoon 2 so that's kind of weird
6202200	6207560	but anyway uh dark tetsuya saying about the code by the way what i thought really neat about this
6207560	6214920	code this is the street fighter code is the color numbers spell out 1987 get it and hey to be fair
6214920	6219400	you have to do the same type of thing to unlock akuma in street fight excuse me street fighter
6219400	6225640	originally so i remember all the drama you had to go through to unlock roll it is it is it is
6225640	6229080	one of those things that once you do it once it should kind of be permanent but whatever all right
6229080	6235240	anyway enough of that let's talk about what is out in stores this week starting with the us loki so we
6235240	6240280	have a few things coming out this week um starting off with avon colony that's coming out on pc
6240280	6247160	playstation 4 and xbox one fable fortune on xbox one and pc i guess they got held back a little bit

6535720	6542040	hello humanoids there's a link to a twitter thing on friday nintendo announced the next
6542120	6548120	platoon 2 splatfest battle will be team mayo versus team ketchup to which sky remarked
6550360	6557240	fuck off this is disgusting and an attack and i stand by my statement personally i just think
6557240	6562920	it's fucking stupid can you agree of any other fucking stupid splatfest battles they could do
6562920	6569320	how about team pinot noir versus team savignon block uh stable stay black writer dude i would
6569320	6574440	participate i i think a good splatfest would be team red wines versus white wines i think that's
6574440	6577880	a decent one worth having except that this is supposed to be a kids game but they can find a
6577880	6581880	creative way to word it like what's your favorite grape you like red grapes or white grapes that's
6581880	6587720	how you do it it would be and i think it's team box wine versus team bottle wine i it's all
6587720	6592840	delicious i just want to remind people the reason why i feel so strongly about this is i really
6592840	6598440	fucking hate mayonnaise and what what drives me bonkers about it is that it's not this well it
6598440	6605720	isn't it isn't splatfest itself this is an excuse for people to tag me on twitter talking about team
6605720	6612440	mayo and i'm just like shut up it's not fun i don't know if i'd be comfortable with a lot of
6612440	6619080	squid shooting substances that are similar to mayo around in that game you know what i hate ketchup
6619080	6624360	well here here's here's the thing i'm i i don't even really like ketchup i guess i'm team ketchup
6624360	6630680	by default but i am with the emailer i am team this is just ridiculous in general but i i'm only
6630680	6638040	team ketchup because i have to be but in the reality i'm going to california extreme this
6638040	6645080	weekend anyway right preach splatfest can kind of kiss my submarine sandwich guess what what
6645080	6649400	i'm not going to be in the cast at california extreme we can play ddr that'll be fun wait

6687560	6693160	just to be fair jd is pointing out splatfest his first weekend of august it's not next weekend well
6693160	6699480	i'm gonna fucking make plans the first weekend of august i am doing something other than splatfest
6699480	6706600	what let's go to a museum i would i team art team art let's go to the rosa crucial museum read a
6706600	6710280	book we're going to sit we're going to san jose and we're going to go to the rosa crucial team
6710360	6715080	science win that time oh that's right they did an art versus science thing didn't they god damn it
6715080	6720600	all right anyway hi olr it's reginator again with another seemingly random question thank you for
6720600	6729640	saving us he said semen you know is it seemingly why don't they just do team tits and team ass
6729640	6734040	why don't they just do that is uh team i want to see the shirts to come along with that one
6734040	6739000	why can't you have both can we get like the like the boob like hats you know that they have
6739640	6743880	so what would it be team dick versus team ass no why not team tits and ass
6743880	6750760	team no no we need team dick too there are plenty of women that would still pick tits
6750760	6757240	there are not many men who have boobs like that all right team we'll do uh team eggplant emoji
6757240	6763400	versus team peach emoji okay okay okay okay so we'll have one week of team tits and ass and one
6763400	6767880	tea tea week of peach emoji and i'll just i'll just set them all up i'll set them all up okay
6767880	6772680	because nintendo can't possibly handle the i love this idea what we should do on the show
6773320	6777160	if we i'm sorry to derail the email but you know what this is far more important than whatever sale
6777160	6783720	he's going to talk about so love your agent here so here's the thing i think when splatfest is lame
6784280	6793400	we replace it and we say these are the new teams we overrule nintendo and their inferior online
6793400	6799160	system and we are officially overruling this week's team mayo like they could have done
6799160	6807000	instead of mayo and ketchup they could have done alfredo and marinara okay oh and i would still
6807000	6811880	i would still be team marinara so anyway so but i think we should overthrow with team peach emoji
6811880	6816440	and team uh eggplant emoji that's a good one pesto versus marinara that even better anyway
6817320	6824040	i was just gonna break it but but but but i also will go out and and say there are men with nice
6824040	6831320	racks sure but i'm just saying it's not exactly and there's men with great asses just saying
6831960	6838360	it's all about the hip groove that's it okay so reginator talking about sales um
6839240	6844440	obviously most of us within the vog community enjoy video games to one extent or another
6844440	6851880	be it on console handheld or pc can't stand them but obviously we all don't have the time and or
6851880	6857080	energy to play games nearly as much as we would probably like and for various reasons that being
6857080	6863160	said is there any gaming specific gaming related media that you all like and make use of to fill
6863160	6872600	the void and what specifically um my iphone gaming related media i guess podcasts just
6872600	6878760	will pop yeah that goes without saying i just have my iphone yeah iphone is awfully convenient
6878760	6885080	i catch the pokemans at my desk gaming in your pocket and twitter and all that uh social media
6885080	6890840	i think is huge it's it's good and it's bad you know obviously there's a lot of good that comes
6890840	6895480	from social media and there's a lot of garbage so it's just kind of one of those depending on what
6895480	6899480	color glasses you're wearing on twitter i found a youtube channel that i absolutely fall in love
6899480	6905320	with and it's relaxing nintendo music which has like our tracks of nothing but the most relaxing
6905320	6910760	tracks from different games i like that i like three hour youtubes of people dissecting a two
6910760	6915560	minute pokemon trailer that was something shane introduced me to i was like wow this is uh this
6915560	6922200	is something i just discovered and i'm like it's our it's basically our show i discovered a channel
6922200	6927960	i think it's called like totally not jake who does like this dragon ball power level thing
6927960	6932200	and just listening that someone had the time to break down all the episodes and the manga and
6932200	6939880	try to figure it out i'm like dude i'm completely listening to this fascinated wrapped even and i
6939880	6946120	don't know why it's like well then usually i'm playing xenoverse at the same time so it's like
6946120	6950360	it's like when you eat food and watch cartoon network not cartoon network food network why
6950360	6956040	they say cartoon network or when you're like for people of that persuasion doing it while watching
6956040	6961800	important sure so i kind of miss g4 tv in that sense i mean not the later years but the earlier
6961800	6967560	years i missed tech and all that stuff i kind of missed that when that was more in its heyday both
6967560	6972360	those channels because you know that would be like i'm gonna zone out watch food network or i'm gonna
6972360	6977000	you know zone out watch uh cartoon network is like oh i can zone out watch the video game channel but
6977000	6983480	now it's i suppose it's twitch is kind of that now so i mean twitch is a decent answer and if
6983480	6987960	when i say twitch i mean mixer i mean youtube and all of it in one big bucket but the video game
6987960	6993560	social streaming is is huge obviously twitch is a generic yeah i like kleenex like clean yeah
6993560	7000200	exactly uh loki really real quick gaming media i watched him i will even during work like as i'm
7000200	7004760	working stuff he watches the ready player one trailer over and over and over again no i already
7004760	7011560	did that today um so uh no i watch um well funny enough it's not really game really i watch a lot
7011560	7017320	of red letter media because they do funny reviews of movies and i like that um but like gaming
7017320	7023640	related stuff usually at home i'll watch a few different uh youtube channels so like ollie43
7023640	7029080	does a lot of grants without a mod videos and just like silly shit that's just like small um i'll
7029080	7036040	watch some of the replays of um awesome games on quick because those are pretty fun and then uh
7036040	7043320	helix snake because of his uh skate 3 glitch videos are just fucking hilarious and um you
7043320	7050920	occasionally i'll watch reviews from um oh what is it uh angry joe show although sometimes he
7050920	7057240	gets on my nerves um and then i've been listening i don't know uh jim sterling the jimquisition
7057800	7061560	you know i just like listening to a lot of i guess those are almost like podcasts well
7062440	7066440	especially uh jim sterling show and stuff is more like a podcast but
7067000	7070680	i don't know i like their like opinions on stuff and it's entertaining to listen to
7070680	7073720	i don't listen to a whole time podcast occasionally i'll listen to the
7073720	7078520	uh completely unnecessary podcast with pat the nes punk and he talks about like stuff
7078520	7082440	and retro games and things i like the one where he talks to his neighbor
7084680	7088360	yeah they do that sometimes by the way it's totally not mark is the channel
7088440	7092200	so i linked one of them in the chat so that people know who i was talking about
7092200	7095400	i'm just going to chat because i noticed people in chat are also talking about
7095400	7101480	non-gaming things they zone out to dr tsuya says i think my non-gaming thing is dead malls lol
7101480	7106440	a dude abandoned theme parks i've watched a few videos of those those are pretty fun um or for
7106440	7114200	me for me wow presents oh honey or the ben heck show i like the ben heck show a lot honey oh
7114200	7123880	honey honey honey honey contact anyway i will not jody foster this behavior i need to watch
7123880	7130120	contact so i get katya's references you haven't seen contact yet no i haven't okay i'm not gonna
7130120	7134760	suggest to you there's a joke like there's a youtube series i still need to see always
7134760	7140200	reference the other the other movie that was like that um it wasn't a nolan film or something like
7140200	7145000	that it just came out not too long it's interstellar oh yeah i did see that it was
7145000	7150360	interesting anyway oh yes reginator yes for me i enjoy reading books be it physical ebooks or
7150360	7156280	audiobooks based on games listen to game soundtracks and read the comics when i find them
7156280	7162840	or watch twitch or reruns of old school gaming based tv shows you know i did actually read a lot
7162840	7169800	of comics based on i i had the first series of street fighter comics that came out before udon
7169800	7179480	was a thing the the publisher so those were pretty cool anyway i'm gonna go back and read
7179480	7185880	really clear one again probably maybe good good all right that's it for our uh our mailbag tonight
7185880	7190520	participate at orange laundry.com if you would like to send us an email in the future for us to
7190520	7197880	read here so all right uh let's move on with some more gaming news loki so nintendo has filed a
7197960	7207400	trademark application in the eu for a graphical representation of nintendo controllers including
7207400	7214920	the nintendo 64 the previous time that they had done this was for the nes and the snes which
7215480	7223240	you may remember have now mini systems for them so the thought is hey they're gonna release a mini
7223240	7230200	n64 classic edition that you won't be able to buy maybe in 2018 or something to that effect
7230840	7234600	so that might be something to look forward to what can print money next
7234600	7239720	although how i mean not to be too shady but how many nintendo 64 games are going to be
7241000	7245880	worthy of a collection are they going to cut it down to 15 games because i'm not i i mean how
7245880	7252600	many games are worth revisiting i'm sorry it sounds so shady but there's probably not quite
7252600	7258360	as rich of a collection as nintendo maybe they'll put the was it animal woods or whatever the fuck
7258360	7264040	that animal crossing game was originally yeah don't worry forest or whatever don't don't worry
7264040	7269480	is a type of food all right eat though what you're saying that it can't be a force of it
7269560	7277880	so i was close i had like two of the four syllables i don't know maybe they could put like
7277880	7288360	um you know mario 64 star mark mario kart mario kart superman yeah it's all superman 64 60 30
7288360	7292840	versions of it or something um i'm sure there's games that they could find on it it'd be golden
7292840	7296680	eye okay come on noga says golden eye if they can get the rights for it because was it was
7296680	7302920	it a nintendo that's a rare game yeah oh that might be get complicated but okay well if the
7302920	7307640	rights work out yeah golden i would be that that's all they it doesn't even need anything besides
7307640	7314760	banjo kazooie then and then people will fucking buy it if donkey kong 64 don't count country 64
7314760	7322680	um i don't know there's lots of games all right and folks in chat rock this should be a list list
7322680	7329000	maybe what god that's like three listless ideas from tonight but yeah i mean so i mean i'm curious
7329000	7334760	to see what kind of hardware the super nintendo ones running on because the nes classic one could
7334760	7341080	play snes games genesis all that stuff and i want to say it did 64 games as well it wouldn't be
7341080	7346280	surprised it's the same hardware they just keep popping in the new shells pokemon puzzle league
7346920	7356200	hey you pikachu and um pokemon snap pokemon snap done but isn't hey pikachu need like a require a
7356200	7361640	microphone okay if nintendo can't fucking put a two dollar microphone into these things then
7361640	7367880	what's the point if i can't play hey you pikachu if nintendo can't put a voice app in their system
7367880	7372440	that has you know yeah why doesn't hey you pikachu just run through an app that they're
7372520	7377640	brilliant problem solved i think we need to go to a new story let's let's talk about a game that
7377640	7381800	came out recently that's uh really awesome actually since i now have i don't know i've
7381800	7386200	talked a lot about this on the show i finally bought a 4k monitor during the amazon prime
7386200	7391800	i don't have the video card yet that can quite pump out the 4k smooth visuals but i am getting
7391800	7396520	well i can do 4k video and i'm getting the 2k like i can play like that next level that's kind
7396520	7401880	of in between and so i've been playing doom a little bit with that and making myself barf
7401880	7405240	because that game moves so fast but it's awesome but i'm actually really happy to
7405240	7414200	hear that uh bethesda is going to be doing a doom 6.66 update which will unlock all the dlc
7414200	7419000	for free that's right all players are going to get all the dlc for free at least the multiplayer
7419000	7424440	uh dlc which i think is all there was uh it'll also change up the progression system big time
7424440	7428920	because this time uh used to unlock random stuff kind of like you do in overwatch now
7428920	7433800	specific items and customizations will go for different levels so you can check that out my
7433800	7438600	question to you guys into our chat room is how do you feel though about that whereas i'm happy that
7438600	7444360	this is going free because i never touched the dlc how do you guys feel about if you go and buy dlc
7444360	7449720	for a game and then six months a year later it's free for everybody do you feel burned a little bit
7449720	7457880	or a little bit i guess but whatever they've done it in other games i suppose has xbox gold
7457880	7463880	or playstation the their rewards program if they ever done like dlc as a reward i don't think no
7463880	7469640	but like i've seen discounts i guess i've seen them do that before though i it's not a new thing
7470680	7475960	it's a rare thing because you know usually those companies are like oh let's make some money we
7475960	7485240	still want money money money money right um so um i don't know it's uncommon well i want to go
7485240	7488680	revisit this game now especially with all the multiplayer stuff i didn't play multiplayer
7488680	7492280	enough i kind of want to try it again see if i get it looks like getting mad at like a game of
7492280	7495880	the year edition comes out for something that you know it's cheaper anyways it's like you've been
7495880	7502040	playing it for a while now right right whatever you can't be too bad in our shape i thought this
7502040	7510600	next thing was really cool dark sakura what do you have for us well um the uh nbc uh it's actually
7510600	7518920	for nbc left field uh has decided to talk about who owns the moon and they did a video using
7518920	7525960	minecraft to explain who owns the moon it's actually really good the the things up on the
7525960	7534360	twitter channel um uh at nbc left field and i thought it actually was pretty informative there
7534360	7540120	were things that i knew but also a few things that i didn't know and it was really something
7540200	7546520	that i think could be understood by all ages but uh definitely something worth a watch um
7546520	7553480	for anyone in our chat room i would be more than happy to link it to you so um but it was really
7553480	7561640	cute and you know the other thing is that it goes to show that um that minecraft can be an
7561640	7567640	educational tool as well not just you know digging holes for stress relief like i do
7567640	7574600	so i only use it for programming they've got whole classes based on minecraft for programming
7574600	7577640	you know well now they have the minecraft education edition i mean this yeah this is
7577640	7582120	what kids are playing in school now as opposed to oregon trail which a number munchers like we all
7582120	7589080	kind of grew up with so my son this week got into roblox that thing is like weird what's that
7589080	7595000	roblox is like this um knockoff it's not really a knockoff minecraft i mean it's similar graphically
7595000	7599640	to like a minecraft but it's basically imagine you know how they have like the different games
7599640	7603560	that people can make in minecraft like the little i don't know what you call them but the hunger
7603560	7609080	games mod yeah like some like mods but like imagine that that's all it is it's just these
7609080	7613160	mods that you go and play different rooms and they have different games that i mean they can
7613160	7617320	do the hunger games or whatever he did one that was called an ordinary elevator it had like a
7617320	7624520	bunch of weird shit and it like internet meme shit like he you know first time experiencing was it you
7624680	7629080	i'm a cat i'm a kitty cat and that's that sense and then says you know he's like and he thought
7629080	7634920	that was hilarious i'm like wow that's super old wait so your kids are just your kids are
7634920	7639080	discovering memes for the first time yeah he's discovering memes oh boy grow up so fast look out
7639080	7645800	then don't go to the dancing hamster site careful because roblox has also been uh notorious for
7645800	7655400	advertising via adware and for a number of numbers i'll just say be careful i'm sure he
7655400	7662280	has shit already has spam on it well like it yeah it has pop-ups if he's been exposed to dank memes
7662280	7667400	at such a young age it's already ruined it's already downhill from here but they have it at
7667400	7673000	the library you can play roblox at the library that's where he first played it oh wow so i mean
7673000	7679080	if it's good enough for the public library system oh i'm sure that i'm sure nobody ever downloads
7679080	7685720	garbage the public library all right uh a few more stories for you guys then we're gonna get to
7685720	7691560	your calls at orange launch radio on skype but first loki so the next big marathon for twitch
7691560	7698520	what could it possibly be another pbs show no we'll actually have something gaming related to it
7698600	7705000	yes they're gonna be doing starcade awesome yes so they're gonna be marathoning starcade
7705000	7711640	and it's gonna be awesome they say why just because we can they said that their page is
7711640	7718840	not gonna fucking load so is it because sometimes these events are for like charities like they did
7718840	7723880	the mr rogers thing because they were trying to like actually raise money for uh uh pbs i think
7723880	7728760	but uh did your period okay i got it um so they basically said this is a collaboration with the
7728760	7734280	blu-ray publisher shout factory who picked up the rights and i guess maybe it's to promote the
7734280	7741640	blu-rays that are gonna be coming out yeah um yes but yeah so they're gonna be running that's 130
7741640	7748360	episodes it's supposed to begin on august 22nd that's awesome and i guess it's gonna be broadcast
7748360	7753560	on shout factories twitch channel and i once again want to just throw my name in consideration
7753560	7758520	i know i'm a nobody zero on the internet but if starcade were to ever come back i would be the
7758520	7763720	best host ever of that show i'm just saying that would be my fucking dream so if anybody anybody
7763720	7768120	who is anybody is out there listening please consider rob roberts starcade 2017 because i
7768120	7771960	heard they were gonna bring try to bring this yeah that's what i heard too yeah so maybe this
7771960	7776120	is something to kind of gauge the interest for that i don't know so i'm sure i'm sure a lot of
7776120	7781880	people will be uh watching uh on twitch because i'm interested yeah me too i fucking love starcade
7781880	7786200	i grew up oh man i used that was the best part of g4 like in the afternoon you know i used to
7786200	7794360	come home for lunch watch an episode of starcade on g4 and eat whatever food ahead there you go
7795560	7799960	all right well uh hey if you can't watch the starcade marathon maybe this is something you
7799960	7805720	can listen to instead it's uh the adventures of bayou billy soundtrack that's right going back to
7805720	7810760	the 8-bit nes days the adventures of bayou billy was a konami game uh that was on the nes it was
7810760	7816200	actually it was actually kind of fucking terrible but it's still you know classic games are classic
7816200	7820920	games and some people still remember remember some things fondly even if they weren't necessarily
7820920	7826120	very good uh here's the crazy thing ship to shore photo company is hoping that fans of the original
7826120	7829640	game because you know it did have a it did have one of those cool konami soundtracks and a lot
7829640	7833960	of those 8-bit soundtracks uh from konami and back in the day were really cool the soundtrack

7961720	7966040	all right again orange lounge radio all one word on skype if you want to give us a call
7966040	7971560	uh while we wait loki any quick last minute stories you want to get out yes uh so there is
7971560	7977240	a game that was uh kickstarted called 90s arcade racer that is not coming to wii u anymore instead
7977240	7983800	it's going to nintendo switch as 90 super gp nice yep it looks awesome all right let's see if it'll
7983800	7988040	work this time hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hey there's that death it worked hi
7988040	7993880	act after what's on your mind buddy uh pokemon go ah yeah how was your weekend for pokemon go
7995000	8005160	uh it was uh kind of good i tried to uh catch uh arthacona today uh had really really bad luck
8006120	8009640	oh no you didn't catch him or you weren't able to get a group together or what
8010120	8016280	uh no we act i actually saw lots of people that i was kind of surprised about that and
8017240	8024840	we actually did uh of the three arthacunas i participated in the race today uh we can't uh
8024840	8031320	we could uh sorry we defeated two uh one of them we just couldn't because we weren't enough
8032280	8039240	uh but at the time of the capture well that's just pretty tough i'll just say that um you're
8039240	8042360	cutting in a little in and out so you might want to check your mic i don't know it's getting like
8042360	8046680	loud and soft and loud and soft but that's always the joy of live radio is trying to fix things as
8046680	8052760	we go um but yeah yeah i mean i found part of like capturing the legendary stuff um over this
8052760	8057240	weekend it's just you know kind of neat how like all the people are coming together um you know it
8057240	8061720	is it is tricky because you're not guaranteed to get that legendary in fact they are very hard to
8061720	8066760	catch um and that makes some people kind of salty but at the same time i'm not i mean they would be
8066760	8072200	legendary if they're total gimmies you know what i mean so you gotta work a little bit for it a
8072200	8076360	little bit i mean you know if you've done it like nine times and still aren't catching it then
8076360	8080840	that's a little much especially you know and you're paying for those raid passes but if it
8080840	8086840	takes you two or three tries then that's okay i think oh yeah definitely it's uh something that
8087560	8094040	that's it shouldn't be free at least and it's gonna be tough i hopefully i can still do uh
8094840	8101160	this raids or that they don't uh stop showing up because that's that's something that Niantic
8101160	8109880	didn't clear up since they only said oh we're going to do the double xp the the egg thing and
8109880	8116120	all that stuff until monday but they didn't clarify if that also applies to uh to these
8116120	8122120	raids but hopefully not yeah i don't know it would be so dumb of them to just end the legendary
8122120	8126840	thing especially when we know that moltres and zapatos they're gonna happen it's just a matter
8126840	8131080	of whenever niantic wants to push the button but the rules of their little challenge were never
8131080	8135720	really that clear and obviously they threw it all out the window ever anyway and i kind of think we
8135720	8140200	got the conclusion that was already foregone is that everything was going to get unlocked anyway
8140200	8144040	but they never really made that clear which was kind of another issue with that whole event
8144040	8149320	but um by the way your mic sounded much better whenever you did fix it um so i want to ask you
8149320	8152200	real quick though what you think of all the stuff i don't know if you were here at the very beginning
8152200	8155080	of the show when charles is here what you think of all that stuff that was going on in chicago
8155720	8161960	uh i only uh well first of all i changed mics because uh i'm testing a new one but sorry about
8161960	8169560	that uh i i only caught the last part of that uh because i was outside uh trying to catch an article
8170360	8180120	fair excuse but yeah um i i think and i kind of agree that niantic does need to step up because
8180120	8186520	yeah the game has been out for a year and i do think that they have done a lot to change the
8186520	8193720	game and to fix it and to make it uh enjoyable but they do need to to step up they need to
8194280	8200920	work on a lot of things uh uh like people that still have the the problems with pokemon the the
8200920	8209560	plus uh uh watch i i i have heard of mine that cannot use uh her pokemon go plus because it won't
8209560	8217800	connect at all and it's kind of weird and and again uh the uh some people uh there weren't many
8217800	8224440	but some people today with uh on the raids were having problems uh like trying to get in the game
8224440	8230680	trying to get uh getting the uh the game running all that stuff and not to mention the the people
8231480	8239400	that went to the fest that that was a complete failure on their part but i did uh at least i'm
8239400	8245000	kind of optimistic on this and i think that diantic can learn from from this experience
8245880	8254440	and speaking of uh if should niantic uh sell or or give up pokemon go to another company
8255080	8264600	uh i was looking up a phrase about this that says it's uh sorry sorry
8266920	8270120	it's better the devil you know than the angel you don't
8270280	8278680	i like that so so yeah you uh we uh niantic can get rid of pokemon go i they would make
8278680	8284920	tons of money without selling it but i don't know if i would prefer another company handled
8284920	8293640	and uh handling pokemon go uh since niantic and despite uh my probably dislike for ingress because
8293720	8298680	that game i really don't don't see the appeal of playing it right now
8299560	8308600	at least they know how the stuff works it's even if if niantic screws uh lots of things up i i
8308600	8315240	think they at least they know their their core and they can and they can improve it and i hope
8315240	8320600	they do yeah i i do you know despite my criticisms in the beginning of the show i am rooting for
8320600	8325560	niantic this was just this was just a face plant of pretty epic proportions that that really should
8325560	8330520	have been avoided and i get i think you're kind of right in a way is that um you know heaven forbid
8330520	8335400	ea buys niantic i mean you know obviously i'm making i'm making up these completely crazy
8335400	8340840	scenarios but i'm just saying you know i don't know if niantic necessarily lost money i mean
8340840	8344760	yes they had to refund and so basically they had to front all the money for the park and all that
8344760	8350600	but they're making money on people buying all these raid passes to do the new legendary raids
8350600	8355960	so i don't know if niantic necessarily lost money on this event but there was a huge blown
8355960	8361480	opportunity in that regard and uh you know somebody's got to answer for that one way or another
8361480	8367800	so anyway yeah yeah definitely they're making tons of money so i i don't think there was that was uh
8367800	8373560	like complete loss yeah but yeah all right well acta thank you so much for your perspective and
8373560	8378040	good luck uh catching the continued legendaries when they roll out uh zapados and uh multerase
8378040	8384600	and all that stuff it'll be fun thank you all right take care my friend all right uh zach
8384600	8388600	deft here on the show if you want to give us a call orange lounge radio all one word on skype
8388600	8392360	i don't know if we have any other last minute stories i want to get actually just slipped
8392360	8395400	through there was another call that was coming in i was going to grab but it just slipped through
8395400	8400520	uh do you have another story you want to mention lonky yeah they've got a new level i guess this
8400520	8405560	is a loss level from the crash bandicoot series that they're putting out is free dlc
8405560	8411400	until august 19th called stormy ascent cool let's get to another call hi you're on orange
8411400	8416040	lounge radio who's this what's up guys it's kai judo hey kai judo what's on your mind buddy
8416920	8421400	not much i'm just gonna make this quick because i'm on my tablet and the connection's kind of
8421400	8426520	funky but um i know you guys were talking about uh g4 earlier i kind of missed what the email
8426520	8433080	was about but um did you know that disney disney they have a network it's called a disney xd px
8433640	8440280	and i think yeah xd yeah that's what's called so they they switched that now over to what disney
8440280	8444360	b xp and i think it's uh i think it's for the entire weekend i think it's from like
8445320	8450120	from like friday to sunday they just do like a block a video game show from like nine and nine
8450120	8454680	at night to like three in the morning really somebody shows awful but um they have some good
8454680	8460440	ones in there no i want to see like is an ign show on there now or something i thought i read
8460440	8465320	yeah yeah that's about to come on in a like i think in another 30 minutes they got a four
8465320	8469320	ign episodes that are coming up i don't know what that show is i haven't watched it yet but um
8470360	8474360	the show that i did like that did impress me a little bit even though it's still for kids
8474360	8479240	and people with add there's a show called a polarized primetime and that's pretty good
8479240	8484280	like basically what that is is like um what's that show that the uh the woman does she's from
8484280	8490440	um she's from glee remember she did like a a game show where she's supposed to be in the living room
8490440	8495560	what do you call that show oh hollywood game night yeah it's almost like that you can kind
8495560	8499720	of say like they have like two celebrity guests then they have like the host and like they're
8499720	8503240	all supposed to be in their living room it's supposed to be like you're having a game party
8503240	8507640	or something you know like they have to guess it okay different games but um it's pretty fun and
8507640	8511880	interesting the only problem with it is since it's for kids it's really hard to keep up with
8511880	8515960	everything like everyone's yelling and screaming you know there's like these quick cuts and you
8515960	8523160	know you're like what the fuck it's like playing mario party in my house um that's i that sounds
8523160	8528040	neat i'll have to check that out i had no idea it was actually i did know of disney xd because
8528040	8533800	that's where the tron phineas and ferb well there's that too but the tron um what was the
8533800	8540200	tron not trom legacy tron something was the the anime yeah it was on disney xd but they aired it
8540200	8544200	like friday nights or something and i don't think i got the greatest ratings on there so that's why
8544200	8549400	they never did a second season but that's i was aware of tronic uh disney xd tron uprising thank
8549400	8554840	you that was it so but that's neat that they do like so so kind of like how cartoon network has
8554840	8560200	adult swim disney xd or whatever does a video game block late at night for the people who are up
8560200	8565640	that's interesting i like that the worst show on there uh to not get into names confusing with
8565640	8574680	a good show is called a polarized primetime the awful show is the polarized uh pick this player
8574680	8578920	or something like that where it's just like um it's just a bunch of youtube clips uh clips all
8578920	8583320	streamed together like what like they have like a box they have like a a little box with like
8583320	8587960	different youtubers in it and the box just jumps around randomly picks a youtube player and you
8587960	8592520	just watch like this nonsensical video that you can't even make heads or tails out of so it's
8592520	8600280	you're not the right age it's a tv show all about influencers sounds like a delight right yeah
8601160	8607880	yeah just terrible another great show um they uh they have like uh a fighting show i guess
8607880	8611880	it's going to be like their reality show and uh each week when some i think they're playing
8611880	8615640	street fighter each week when someone wins they become like the the king or something like that
8615640	8620760	they sit on the throne and then the next week they have they have to uh battle um the winner
8620760	8624680	out of the the next two people that play each other so they got they got a good thing going
8624680	8628440	with the network you need to check that out all right i like it i like it all right kaijuto

8860360	8865560	i'd like money i'm laughing at it as a student 100 mad in chat says accordion multi-ball
8866520	8870600	you know what that would happen i could see that polka polka ball it would be called the
8870600	8876520	polka ball i love it i love it design the table by the way um i i was telling you earlier i'm
8876520	8883800	going to be putting this up on youtube but right now it's on my tumblr which is kurotsubasa.tumblr.com
8883800	8894040	like yeah spell it slowly k-u-r-o-u-t-s-u-b-a-s-a okay dot tumblr.com okay um i have video um we're
8894040	8898680	borrowing cactus canyon right now which was a limited release pinball table toward the end of
8898680	8905160	the williams you know pinball um and there's mods out for it that could make it uh into what's
8905160	8910040	called cactus canyon continued that has like special skill shots and different multi-ball
8910040	8914680	modes in it so we've got one in our garage right now that we're borrowing from a friend and i have
8914680	8921960	video up of cowboys versus aliens multi-ball which basically goes from this crazy old west
8921960	8928920	theme with you know western you know theme song type background music into freaking dubstep with
8928920	8934920	shooting it is exactly that it's a skrillex song it's a remix but it's the best thing ever because
8934920	8942360	it changes the whole feel of the table and it is the most fun to play so most extra it is very
