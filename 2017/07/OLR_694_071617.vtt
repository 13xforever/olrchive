This week it's Christmas in July with the reveal of new and ported games for VR and the Kingdom Hearts 3 train finally

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
disembarked with the content reveal at Disney's D23. We have plenty more from the week's gaming news and it all starts

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice

00:37.000 --> 00:42.000
it's Orange Lounge Radio live tonight on July the 16th of 2017

00:42.000 --> 00:48.000
episode number 694 of our show. My name is Rob Roberts

00:48.000 --> 00:54.000
here with you every week with my co-hosts right over there say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Sommers

00:54.000 --> 00:59.000
Hello, hi. Hi, how are you? I'm very full. Yes, do you have a little lunch for the show?

00:59.000 --> 01:06.000
It's more like a dinner with the time of this show. I had my frappuccino

01:06.000 --> 01:11.000
and my something's been upset since last night. So because Dan took me to Chevy's and

01:11.000 --> 01:16.000
Peppers. Oh, nice. Yeah. So yeah,

01:16.000 --> 01:21.000
otherwise okay. Otherwise hanging in there. That's good. I saw you're still in the boot with

01:21.000 --> 01:26.000
your cast but you said something about this is your third boot. This is my third boot. The second one

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000
because not this past Friday but the one before that I got my second change and

01:31.000 --> 01:36.000
they made it way too thin and it started to apparently I kick a lot in my sleep

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
and the thing split because I can apparently kick

01:41.000 --> 01:46.000
fiberglass apart. Wow. So they made it triple thick and

01:46.000 --> 01:51.000
this one's lasting and it's harder to walk in but it'll only

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
it's coming off on the 25th. So is that a sugar thing? Like if you have sugar before bed because

01:56.000 --> 02:01.000
because Alan says it on the is so embarrassing but I'm going to tell it anyway. So

02:01.000 --> 02:06.000
like sometimes we'll have like Slurpees for 7-Eleven because we live right in Iran and Slurpees are really good and

02:06.000 --> 02:11.000
they have this cotton candy Slurpee right now. So like maybe we don't do it every day but maybe like once a week I'll have a Slurpee and sometimes I'm

02:11.000 --> 02:16.000
stupid and I have it right before bed and Alan says if I do that it's like I will kick

02:16.000 --> 02:21.000
kick kick kick like in my sleep. Like it's really bad and he says it's the sugar's fault. I just

02:21.000 --> 02:26.000
do that anyway. Oh. Are you doing Kung Fu in your sleep? I'm a very active

02:26.000 --> 02:31.000
dreamer apparently. I see. I see. So kicking lots of MRAs in your sleep. I've fallen out of bed

02:31.000 --> 02:36.000
twice with this on. I wish I were kidding but I'm not. I hit my head pretty

02:36.000 --> 02:41.000
hard the first time. Yikes. Well I'm glad you're okay. All things considered. Thank you. All right. But yeah the boot.

02:41.000 --> 02:46.000
I'm ready for it to go. All right. How much longer? 25th. Oh that's not too bad.

02:46.000 --> 02:51.000
So next Sunday will be my last Sunday with it on. Nice. All right. Cool cool. Well also say hello to tech master

02:51.000 --> 02:56.000
Loki. Hello. Hi Loki. How are you? I'm also full. Yeah. Are you doing your whole

02:56.000 --> 03:01.000
dozen breadsticks and all that? Yeah it's just because of the breadsticks size

03:02.000 --> 03:07.000
whoever's making these breadsticks needs a lesson. They're doing it wrong because I see I used to make these

03:07.000 --> 03:12.000
breadsticks and they're not supposed to be this large because it's too much dough. The ratio

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
of the dough to everything else is way off and I can tell just by

03:17.000 --> 03:22.000
looking at it it's like okay some dumbass is using the wrong dough for this shit.

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
But whatever. So that's why like because the one time I get six

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
is when they're going to fuck it make it right and it's going to be too little. So whatever

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
this way I can share. So she's had three three

03:36.000 --> 03:41.000
new boots boots put on. So I guess this is a reboot.

03:41.000 --> 03:46.000
Did you did you think of that joke in all the minutes before our tonight. No just like a few seconds.

03:46.000 --> 03:51.000
I see. And I'm pretty sure that you know you're not like you know kicking because the sugar you're just chasing

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
the mailman. So it's fine. I'm chasing what the mailman

03:57.000 --> 04:02.000
makes sense. You think when I when I'm asleep I dream I'm a dog. Well if I

04:02.000 --> 04:07.000
did dream I was a dog I'd be a corgi because they're so cute and I want to belong to the queen of England.

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
I saw it was at Flocko Jones the other day. Yeah he was talking about like I was telling him like the other day I

04:12.000 --> 04:17.000
was so tired I was falling asleep in my dream like in my dream I'm like man I want to just like fall

04:17.000 --> 04:22.000
asleep right now. You dreamt about taking a nap. I dreamt about taking a nap like I'm like I want to take another nap.

04:22.000 --> 04:27.000
It's like sleep ception there. But he's like yeah the other day I had a dream where I was a cat and I was laying on the bed.

04:27.000 --> 04:33.000
I'm like was it like from your perspective as a cat or were you just like looking at a cat on a bed.

04:33.000 --> 04:38.000
And it was like I don't know. It was just a funny conversation. Dreams are weird man.

04:38.000 --> 04:45.000
They are. All right. Games right. It is a video game show believe it or not. You know but I'm gonna be real with you all this week.

04:45.000 --> 04:50.000
It was a slow. It was a slow news week this week. I mean there's some things about this. It's kind of a slower week.

04:50.000 --> 04:57.000
I guess with it being summertime and people taking their summer vacations and it's relatively E3 after E3.

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
Yeah E3 you know everybody kind of said everything they had to say a month ago so it's slowing down a bit.

05:01.000 --> 05:09.000
So tangents they're inevitable. But talking about games a little bit. Obviously we have this ongoing saga here on OLR about Loki develops his own game.

05:09.000 --> 05:15.000
And there's been a few weeks where you're kind of like yeah I've been too busy. Yeah I have ideas but you said you worked on your game this week.

05:15.000 --> 05:19.000
A little bit yeah. This is not the car game though. No this is not the car game. We need to let the car go.

05:19.000 --> 05:24.000
This is casually. Well I haven't given up on that. It's just I want to do something different with it.

05:24.000 --> 05:29.000
And even my son the other day he's like are you going to work on the car game anymore? I'm like god damn it.

05:29.000 --> 05:37.000
Aww good job. We need to get the dark soccer. We need to get that kid a cookie. Now the kids getting on Loki about the game.

05:38.000 --> 05:43.000
Well no I'm not working on it right now. I'm working on something else you know.

05:43.000 --> 05:56.000
But anyways so like I you know I was working on this like I don't even know if I'm like really entering the game jam because like I've been like I said I've been really tired like as I mentioned I've had a dream where I was dream about sleeping some more.

05:56.000 --> 06:06.000
So I've been like exhausted and I've tried working on it and actually I've had a few days where it's been like I had a moment and I'm able to just like kind of focus and actually work on stuff and so I did.

06:06.000 --> 06:27.000
I have I've been trying to you know build out the basic stuff for like a clicker game. So I have like the thing that I worked on a little bit was actually getting the amounts to display correctly because you know you're clicking on stuff and you can't really just have a number increment up.

06:27.000 --> 06:42.000
You know you have to actually do some formatting otherwise get that weird scientific notation at the end. Yeah which some people might not want. So you have to like specify formatting and stuff to put all the weird names and stuff after it or the abbreviations everything so I actually built that.

06:42.000 --> 06:55.000
And then I'm building something else to read an Internet clock so that I can do that. And then you know just some basic button stuff for like OK you can purchase this and the increments up each level.

06:55.000 --> 07:24.000
You say but stuff. Oh button button button stuff. Yeah. But in stuff. Button stuff. Yes. So what kind of game like the framework in place and then I can work on the actual theme I want to do with it afterwards I have ideas but it's like I've been really busy at work so I don't have time to like sit there like in downtime to just kind of think of stuff and you know mock stuff outside and work on it at home.

07:24.000 --> 07:43.000
And so when I get home it's like OK what do I need to make. And like you know it takes me a while to get there but I've been trying just I'm very tired. The problem is I stay up too late because I'm tired and I want to work on something and I get frustrated so I end up staying up too late which makes me tired the next day. It's an endless cycle.

07:44.000 --> 07:56.000
I see. Yeah. No I know how it is. I stay up until two in the morning and then the next day I'm like boy I'm tired. I should take a nap. So I take a nap and then I can't get to sleep when I should be going to sleep so I stay up till two in the morning. I totally get it. It's a cycle. Yeah it is a cycle. I understand.

07:57.000 --> 08:07.000
Hey we've got a live chat room of course. We do tape live every Sunday night at the voice geek network of vog network dot com six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

08:07.000 --> 08:23.000
And if you want to join us live live dot vog network dot com and MXC unfortunately in chat reminding us RIP George Romero. Yeah that that just happened earlier today. George Romero who made Night of the Living Dead all those you know super famous zombie movies passed away today.

08:23.000 --> 08:36.000
And I know a lot of my friends are bummed about that because you know I work a lot with the horror film fest here in SAC because they do the cult movie extension with Rocky or and everything. So I know a lot of people are really sad about that and obviously the guy you know I may not be super into scary horror movies.

08:36.000 --> 08:49.000
But I I recognize this guy for making all those awesome movies. But yeah well and and to be fair it's it's a gaming show tying it to games a little bit a game like Dead Rising was straight up Night of the Living Dead.

08:50.000 --> 09:02.000
Yeah. I mean like there's so many games that his movies have inspired. You know I mean it is huge. It is horrible now that he's passed. Who's going to make the zombie movies and or games now. I mean there literally is no one filling that void.

09:02.000 --> 09:14.000
Well he obviously beg to differ. Have you seen Train to Busan. I think that's the joke. It was a joke. Yes I don't know the end saying that there's a lot of zombie movies and or games out there in the market.

09:14.000 --> 09:28.000
Loki you don't understand George Romero now becomes a zombie. We can only hope and he ironically starts a zombie apocalypse. I mean it's the irony and I'm not trying to be an asshole I promise but sometimes you have to see the light hearted things.

09:28.000 --> 09:40.000
I think he would be proud if he was actually proud. I think he'd be excited that people were talking about how to turn him into a zombie. I think so. Also also passed away today.

09:40.000 --> 09:55.000
Martin Landau which I must admit was one of those things where when I heard that I was like didn't that happen two years ago. I felt horrible but that was another best supporting actor Oscar winner that I remember from years ago that passed away a couple years ago.

09:55.000 --> 10:07.000
But no Martin Landau actually he passed today. So that's a bummer too. I can't think of anything directly involving games with him. I think he's more of like a character actor from a lot of movies and people remember Ed Wood was probably one of his more famous roles.

10:07.000 --> 10:19.000
He got nominated for all those Oscars for so yeah kind of kind of feeling feeling some loss in Hollywood today and of course do y'all buy into that superstition that things come in threes.

10:19.000 --> 10:28.000
Well Stan Lee's getting old. No no bite your tongue. Actually that is kind of bad because his wife just died. Shame on you Loki shame.

10:29.000 --> 10:41.000
Did Zsa Zsa Gabor finally pass. Did that finally happen an age ago. Oh really. Because that's that's why I would always throw out there when it's like we're looking for a third. That was kind of like your safe non offensive answer was Zsa Zsa Gabor.

10:41.000 --> 10:46.000
But now. Shit I need somebody new now. Take a Kardashian.

10:46.000 --> 10:58.000
I mean they've got a lot of them. Come on. They're not going to miss one of them. Who's she died on December 18th last year. Who's who's like who's like ninety nine in Hollywood right now.

10:58.000 --> 11:05.000
Stanley. No no no Stanley's early 90s and he's he's he's the national treasure. I'm not even going to joke about it.

11:05.000 --> 11:15.000
Dick Van Dyke. As Sasha Velour says don't joke about that. Dick Van. Dick Van Dyke is in his late 90s. Oh oh what about Jerry Lewis.

11:15.000 --> 11:25.000
Is Jerry Lewis still alive. We're looking at that right now. Oh how Jerry Lewis is still alive. OK Jerry I would be ninety nine.

11:25.000 --> 11:34.000
OK. There it is. Jerry sorry. Ninety one. Oh speaking to me. I just had my answer. Everyone's seen Betty White which house. No no.

11:34.000 --> 11:43.000
First of all this is a scolding for me to the chat room. You don't you don't see me right now but I'm wagging my finger you how dare you utter Betty White's name in this topic.

11:43.000 --> 11:53.000
How dare you. How very dare. OK. So actors in their their 90s. Yes. And I'm trying to pick names that people like today would know.

11:53.000 --> 12:09.000
Olivia de Havilland. OK. Is 100. Wow. Which is you know she sued for her likeness used in the feud. Yes. I heard about that. Yes. And they're just you know Douglas is 100. OK. Kirk Kirk Douglas. Oh my gosh. I thought Kirk Douglas had passed.

12:09.000 --> 12:23.000
No. OK. I'm again. Carol Channing ninety six. Peter Salas ninety six. Carol Channing is kind of immortal though. Betty White is ninety five. Carl Reiner is ninety five. Doris Day is ninety five.

12:23.000 --> 12:39.000
S.S. this is a morbid topic you guys. S.S. you 100 Matt links us to a Web site called is a pagoda dead dot com. He finally did pass last year that I know that one I know. Jean Porter ninety four. All right. I remember the Conan O'Brien tribute to him because he had you know been on the show.

12:39.000 --> 12:53.000
So I'm sure. Sure. All right. I'm going with Kirk Douglas if Kirk Douglas is 100. Like that's a that's a good long solid life. It's still alive. That's my news. Don't worry. There'll be plenty of people killed tonight in the new episode of Game of Thrones.

12:53.000 --> 13:04.000
It'll offset everything right. Don't tell people about the competition. Don't tell people. Oh no. I didn't realize that Angela Lansbury is ninety one. Oh my gosh really. Dick Van Dyke is also ninety one.

13:04.000 --> 13:17.000
All right. Close that page Jamie. We need to talk about video games. No more no more old celebrities. All right. Mel Brooks is ninety one. Jamie stop. All right. Mel Brooks also needs to protect. I am coming over there to close the lid to your computer.

13:17.000 --> 13:29.000
Last one. Sidney Poitier. Fine. All right. Moving on. Let's talk about video games. Speaking of bands. That's the kickoff topic I want to get into tonight. So Jamie's just banned old celebrities from our show.

13:30.000 --> 13:41.000
So let's talk a little bit about video game bands because there's been some chat in some various news stories and I have like a little bit of a personal anecdote as well about bands in video games.

13:41.000 --> 13:55.000
So Splatoon 2 had it's kind of it's pre kickoff event. I don't know what else to call it was splat fast is what it was but it was kind of like a pre kickoff to Splatoon because the game isn't really out until next Friday because Nintendo games are Friday right.

13:55.000 --> 14:17.000
So it's not on Friday but they did a pre splat fest thing with a special download and you got to participate in the first splat fest which was team cake versus team ice cream one team ice cream one which was the wrong answer because I'm team cake and I'm hearing this whole they actually had dialogue in the game that had this whole like ice cream is now better than cake.

14:17.000 --> 14:33.000
That's the law. Well I'm sorry then I'm a law breaker because ever since I had my gallbladder out. I don't need ice cream because those of you that had a gallbladder out know what happens with certain foods and ice cream is the one for me so that the dot I don't need ice cream anymore.

14:33.000 --> 14:37.000
So you know what I will be a law breaker cake is fine I can eat all the cake in the world.

14:38.000 --> 15:05.000
So until ice cream stops making me physically sick. I'm always going to be team cake and you're going to have to deal with it. But anyway, that's not I did not bring that up to have a cake versus ice cream argument argument all fucking night because Lord knows we're only a couple weeks away from another splat fest and a whole nother thing to get mad at our friends about my point was is that we got to see a little bit of the game in action with this whole and I got to play a little bit of it during my gaming week.

15:06.000 --> 15:21.000
Is my mic cutting out. I can't tell or is it just sorry guys. I couldn't tell my mic was cutting out. They are hearing it cut out in there. So sorry I need to do shopping. Yeah I know right. I might be out of backup mics. This is bad and backup cables.

15:21.000 --> 15:29.000
All right. Well I'm just going to do my best to keep it running. That's the joy of live radio everybody doesn't we have duct tape. That's the way you fix everything right. All right.

15:29.000 --> 15:47.000
Anyway. So where was I. OK. So yes cake versus ice cream. And my point was get the thing. The thing is this is the second cable. This isn't even maybe it's the mixing board. I don't know. Anyway well well it's money and money more money I could spend on the studio.

15:47.000 --> 16:05.000
Anyway where was I going. Yeah where was I going with this. Oh yes. So you got to see a preview of Splatoon 2 in action right. So they were doing the whole Splatfest you actually got to play some stages in the game. You got to do some multiplayer no single player action or any of that or the co-op mode if you want to see that you're gonna have to buy Splatoon 2 when it comes out.

16:05.000 --> 16:17.000
But one thing that people were noticing is that if you were disconnecting from matches purposefully Splatoon was warning you that you were about to get the smackdown.

16:17.000 --> 16:28.000
A Twitter user got a screenshot that said and this is a message that popped up in the game your previous online play session didn't end naturally which is pretty suspicious.

16:28.000 --> 16:43.000
If this keeps happening we're gonna have to block you from playing online for a while. Make sure your Internet isn't busted and try again. So kind of an interesting little disclaimer there from Nintendo that's like we don't care if this is your Internet's fault.

16:43.000 --> 16:53.000
If your Internet is busted don't don't be doing this right now. So I thought that was kind of interesting. What do you guys think of Nintendo's rule there.

16:53.000 --> 17:03.000
I don't have a problem with their people are disconnecting me. It's going to be hard to find out if it's legitimately someone unplugging their Internet or just their Internet going out.

17:03.000 --> 17:15.000
Yeah that's fair because if it's legitimately your Internet that's giving you that much problems then you're probably not going to play online anyways. If you're not consistently able to stay in a game then maybe another game is better for you.

17:15.000 --> 17:27.000
Yeah yeah that's that's kind of my thought too is that you have to know a little bit about your Internet connection and you know your Internet connection being bad could be you know it can have an impact on the other people playing the game.

17:27.000 --> 17:36.000
So you need to call your Internet provider and yell at them a little bit right. I guess but I'm kind of curious I'm sure there's some people out there that are like I can't help that my Internet is cheap.

17:36.000 --> 17:48.000
And so it's like I don't want to like I don't want to sound like oh these people aren't allowed to have a good time but at the same time it's like if you keep disconnecting from matches especially these team based competitions that has an impact on everybody.

17:48.000 --> 17:57.000
If you're finding that you're dropping from a lot of different games and I'm sorry I mean that's just you're going to have to get better Internet or not play online.

17:57.000 --> 18:09.000
Yeah. Here's a stopping in our chat over at live dot com says hey it's on the switch. Take your switch over to your friend's house who has better Internet and play it there.

18:09.000 --> 18:17.000
There you go. That's one stopping in chat says that sucks. I know you have to keep on top of cheaters but last year I was in a place with really shitty Wi-Fi.

18:17.000 --> 18:32.000
I was getting disconnected all the time. Would you be able to switch to wired if it's your Wi-Fi. Could you or I guess does the switch allow you to put a LAN cable in it. I'm not sure if I don't know if it has a physical LAN thing in there but you probably have a they could use the USB.

18:33.000 --> 18:49.000
Oh yeah. That whole thing I guess there's other ways to do that. All right. So there's that. So there's another story going on here that valve band 40 thousand steam users after the steam sale.

18:49.000 --> 19:04.000
So I guess they're saying it's the biggest band wave that steam has ever done eclipsing a record of 15000 in October 2016. Apparently these are back bands and you lose access to playing online in any game that supports back.

19:04.000 --> 19:20.000
That would mean dota to counter strike global offensive. They did the ban for this on this particular day because it prevents them from using the games that they got at a discount during the sale on another account to continue cheating.

19:20.000 --> 19:34.000
So the cheaters lost the money that they spent during the sale. Kind of an interesting little way that I find with that. Yeah. That we have here. And honestly though honestly it's not going to really stop them anyways because they're just going to buy another.

19:34.000 --> 19:47.000
You know another game or another there just start up another account and do it that way. Yeah they're really just cheating all the time. So you know you've seen valve you know try to combat the cheating thing and all this.

19:47.000 --> 19:58.000
So now here's my personal anecdote and then I'm going to get to my question what all these kind of things have in common with the banning. So yesterday Alan and I went out we decided to go play Pokemon go because sometimes we needed to get out of the house.

19:58.000 --> 20:12.000
We have a lot going on yesterday was actually kind of a slower weekend for me. So we went to one of the nearby parks and we were playing Pokemon go and we started taking some of the gyms that were there because there were a lot of red gyms because I play I play mystic and there were a lot of valor gyms only have one Pokemon on them.

20:12.000 --> 20:23.000
So we're like oh this will be easy with two of us take down. So sure enough we take one down. So we take down a gym and then we start walking to the next gym and we see our first gym is already under attack. You guys probably know where this is going.

20:23.000 --> 20:36.000
So we attack another gym and we walk to it and sure enough our first gym gets taken back by the same valor player that was on it. And we're like oh that person was like actually be here. Let's let's watch him go take the other gym that we just took.

20:36.000 --> 20:50.000
So we were going to a third gym. This is a big part. We're going to a third gym and we were taking that one down and we're watching the second gym which is in a tree grove. Right. So you can kind of see if there's anybody in there or around. Nobody's there.

20:50.000 --> 21:05.000
But the second gym is being fought. And then the third gym we kind of like just kind of hang out there for a little bit. We're literally standing right there. The third gym was in an open baseball field. We could see everything if if a person had moved from the second gym to the third gym we'd be able to see it.

21:05.000 --> 21:21.000
Nope. Can't see it. So I reported his ass to Niantic and I hope all of you that see these cheaters in Pokemon Go do it. You need to be like 99.99 percent sure you've got a cheater. But hell yeah I'm going to report it.

21:21.000 --> 21:30.000
I reported the cheating in Ingress and I'm going to report it in Pokemon Go. Fuck cheaters and fuck spoofers. Seriously. It's the worst thing you can do in one of these location based games in my opinion.

21:30.000 --> 21:45.000
So here's the question I have for all you guys with these stories like Splatoon and Valve and all this stuff. What is a game company's responsibility to weeding out the cheaters of their game?

21:45.000 --> 21:58.000
What do you think a game company's responsibility is in weeding out the cheaters of their game? Do you think that you know because the reason why I put it this way is that I think there's a lot of people that when Pokemon Go first came out they were like well nothing's going to get done about spoofers.

21:58.000 --> 22:05.000
Because Niantic doesn't have the staff to handle it. Well the question would be should Niantic have had the foresight to have those game masters.

22:05.000 --> 22:20.000
That's not true though. Niantic could handle it. They could just examine the data that they have like the GPS data because a lot of these spoofing programs that are out there they'll spoof the X and Y but not the Z.

22:20.000 --> 22:30.000
So they're always at the same altitude never changing despite the fact that the landscape might be different. So that's one way to kind of catch people.

22:30.000 --> 22:45.000
And then also reading that extra data like the cell towers that are nearby because they capture all those wifi access points so which wifi networks are nearby? Can you triangulate? Does that match up with what we're showing to be in this area? That type of stuff.

22:46.000 --> 22:51.000
They could do it. It's just are they doing it? Nah.

22:51.000 --> 23:00.000
Kaijuto in chat says something over at live.vognetwork.com that I want to respond to. Kaijuto says if you're going to report a cheat it has to be 100% no doubt not 99%.

23:00.000 --> 23:10.000
Here's why I phrased it the way I did because well for all I know there's an underground tunnel system or this guy's a ninja turtle that lives in the sewers.

23:10.000 --> 23:20.000
I don't know maybe there is a reasonable explanation but all I know is that I am looking all around me there's no cars there's no people like as far as I can see to the eye this guy ain't there.

23:20.000 --> 23:28.000
So the reason why I say that is that I am 99% certain when I record it but Niantic should be 100% when they ban it.

23:29.000 --> 23:40.000
And whatever game it is I'm using Pokemon Go in this case but whatever game it is the game maker should be 100% sure when they do the ban but they have access to logs records and things that I can't see.

23:40.000 --> 23:50.000
They can see this guy's full activity. So yes I think I'm okay saying I'm 99% sure when I report because maybe there's more than meets the eye here I don't fucking know.

23:50.000 --> 23:59.000
But Niantic should be 100% when they pull the trigger and actually ban but that's what you're doing you're filing a request to investigate basically right.

23:59.000 --> 24:10.000
They're not going to just ban because oh Rob reported and one player reported this guy so we're going to ban him like that actually would not be okay because I could get I could just file bans on people I don't like and that's not okay.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
And there's some people that do that but I'm sure.

24:12.000 --> 24:15.000
Yeah I'm sure especially in the other game Jesus Christ.

24:15.000 --> 24:25.000
Well it's like the court system you know you have to weigh the facts and come up with a decision with something that's not going beyond your reasonable doubt.

24:25.000 --> 24:35.000
So I mean you can you've basically looking at the situation sure there could be some weird thing like yeah you could be in a helicopter or something ridiculous.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
There was no helicopter.

24:36.000 --> 24:51.000
Which is not the case but like just say you know that could maybe be a thing or something whatever you know for if you're just making it's not your job to be 100% it's your job to say okay hey I think this person's cheating.

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
It's for them to figure out if this person is cheating right.

24:54.000 --> 24:59.000
And I've you know as yet I have a I have a more than reasonable suspicion this person's cheating.

24:59.000 --> 25:10.000
And it didn't just another thing that made me do it was it didn't just happen once it happened three actually four times because then we went back and took the second note again and we're like let's make this guy burn a bunch of equipment haha.

25:10.000 --> 25:21.000
But then we kind of thought it through and we're like if this guy's a spoofer he's just going to spoof right on over to downtown and load up on pokey stops it's not even going to matter like we actually have to travel to get the equipment.

25:21.000 --> 25:25.000
Anyway, let's see.

25:25.000 --> 25:38.000
Going to our chat over at live.vog network.com stopping and chat says, I think the company has a lot of responsibility if it's in single player no biggie, but multiplayer cheating has a severe effect on the enjoyment of others.

25:38.000 --> 25:46.000
It affects their multiplayer community. If the game goes to shit because multiplayer becomes shit. It's their fault for not clamping down on that.

25:46.000 --> 25:58.000
And I guess it's not as bad as Ingress because Ingress there's at least actual like gaming and score and stuff like that. And so that really matters where it's taking a gym. Who cares? They took a gym.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
It's my coins. That's what matters.

26:01.000 --> 26:16.000
Okay, big deal. It's just a gym. There's no score in the game or really any game yet. It's just very early. But when there are points and stuff worldwide. Yeah, that's going to be a problem. You better fix that shit before that happens.

26:17.000 --> 26:28.000
I want to ask Jamie about this too, what your thoughts are. Not just necessarily Pokemon Go, but bans and the company's responsibility to it in general.

26:28.000 --> 26:32.000
But some other comments in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

26:32.000 --> 26:40.000
SSJ100Matt says, I've had this happen. I was in an open field and nobody was nearby. But this happened when the game came out. Who knows?

26:40.000 --> 26:53.000
SSJ100Matt also says, if Niantic had YouTube rules, they would auto ban people. That's true. So anyway, Jamie, what are your thoughts? What is the company's responsibility to the banning of the players?

26:54.000 --> 27:09.000
It is their responsibility to remove anything that negates the way the game is meant to be played. So if it is creating a disadvantage for the people who are following the rules and they have an obligation to ban those who are not playing by the rules.

27:09.000 --> 27:29.000
So if they don't have the staff available, then they owe it to themselves to dedicate people to it, either by hiring or outsourcing people to manage those certain functions. End of story. There's nothing to argue about it.

27:29.000 --> 27:39.000
As far as cheating in games and how I feel about it, I think I've mentioned this before and I think you guys feel similar, but feel free to jump in with your own opinions.

27:39.000 --> 27:48.000
In single player games, I don't give a crap what you do when it comes to cheating. That's a single player experience. In fact, sometimes cheating is really fucking funny in single player games.

27:48.000 --> 28:00.000
Sometimes I remember, especially in older games, especially older PC games, it was encouraged like, you know, typing in some of those cheat codes, right? IDBFG would give you the gun. All that stuff is like DLC.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
That's a programmed part into the game now.

28:02.000 --> 28:15.000
I guess. Yeah, I guess that's true. That's true. But I mean, with single player games doesn't matter. And I think about like, if you think about it, awesome games done quick in a way is kind of like, it's all about cheating in a way exploiting. It's a great line.

28:15.000 --> 28:19.000
They're not multiplayer. They don't expect other people playing the game.

28:19.000 --> 28:32.000
Exactly. And that's the key difference is that multiplayer. I have a big problem if people want to cheat a multiplayer unless they have set up a server on their own cheater island or whatever to do this.

28:32.000 --> 28:50.000
And I'll even put it this way. And this is in anything, not just gaming in real life. The moment that you do something that puts another party at or a group of people at a disadvantage, you have lost your right to participate. End of story.

28:50.000 --> 29:02.000
Any, you know, and I understand there's, you know, non purpose, purposeful, negative things, but the point that you do it for your own personal game at the gain at the expense of other people. No.

29:03.000 --> 29:11.000
And that's what kind of pisses me off about the Pokemon go stuff is there's a lot of spoofers who really take pride in what they're doing and the whole like deal with it type of stuff.

29:12.000 --> 29:24.000
Exactly. And like, that's like, but like, seriously, you know, that's not fucking fair that the rest of us are actually traveling these spots and actually out there in the real world.

29:24.000 --> 29:36.000
And you feel some sense of pride in having all these gyms that you didn't have to work for. You know what that means? Nothing. It means you're shit. You're a shit player because you have to fucking cheat to get things done.

29:36.000 --> 29:48.000
That's what it means. If you are cheating in these games, you are shit. Get off the internet or get your own fucking, like if you want to cheat and Pokemon go, I'm assuming go, go find a way to set up your own server.

29:48.000 --> 29:57.000
I'm sure hackers going to hack, right? I'm sure there's a way to set up your own fucking Pokemon, go server, have a fucking blast, but don't affect the game that the rest of us are playing.

29:57.000 --> 30:05.000
That's the whole thing. Same thing with MMOs, like World of Warcraft. If you have your own private World of Warcraft servers, if you want to cheat, go.

30:05.000 --> 30:15.000
Man, that Final Fantasy XI server that was on where like the leveling is like, oh, it's 10 times faster. You can run four times faster and you get tons more drops and stuff. That was fun.

30:15.000 --> 30:19.000
But that was also completely separate and it's also shut down and I'm sad that.

30:19.000 --> 30:28.000
And the other point about those private servers is that they are built with the intent of having them played that way. Like all the free Ragnarok servers I was on.

30:28.000 --> 30:36.000
It was made, it doesn't affect anyone else playing on the ones created and maintained by the owners.

30:36.000 --> 30:45.000
So it doesn't matter if you're playing it the way it's not intended to be played. You're not affecting the people who are paying for the service. So.

30:45.000 --> 30:54.000
And I want to mention this in chat over at live.vognetware.com. Bobby Black Wolf, who's before us here on Sunday night says, some people love being trolls.

30:54.000 --> 31:04.000
They like hearing you get upset and call them shit. They just won. Here's the thing. I'm not going to lose sleep over it in a way. I kind of go like, I'm trolling trolls.

31:04.000 --> 31:13.000
But at the end of the day, I'm not going to like, the way Pokemon Go goes is not going to like better or worse in my life. It's a fucking video game.

31:13.000 --> 31:21.000
That's the thing. I'm not going to let the trolls have power over me in that sense. But I am going to make it my mission to end their fun.

31:21.000 --> 31:29.000
Two can play at this game, bitch. And that's my response.

31:30.000 --> 31:41.000
Anyway, anything else on bans before we get into our gaming weeks and the types of video games that hopefully we didn't cheat on? I don't know.

31:41.000 --> 31:47.000
Ban whiny man baby cunts. Ban everything. Ban everything enjoyable. Alright.

31:47.000 --> 31:55.000
No, I'm just talking about the whiny man babies. This is all I'm going to say about it. You don't own Doctor Who. Get the fuck over it.

31:55.000 --> 32:06.000
Here's the thing with all that. And maybe this is just a testament to the people I follow on Twitter or the accounts I mute and so forth.

32:06.000 --> 32:14.000
Like, I'm not seeing people upset about it. I'm just seeing people saying, well, I mean, are you seeking it out?

32:14.000 --> 32:24.000
No. Trust me. I just choose. Block. Move on. Mute. Move on. I just don't follow those people.

32:24.000 --> 32:30.000
I'm going to say this. There are things that women are exposed more to on the internet and in real life than men know to look for.

32:30.000 --> 32:42.000
Because you don't have to look for it. It doesn't affect you. For me all the time, I have seen, even from people that I trusted to be more progressive than apparently how they are,

32:42.000 --> 32:54.000
whining about a very talented actress with a very talented writer going with it, too, being the doctor. And I'm like, what the fuck is your problem?

32:54.000 --> 33:02.000
I thought that you were a better person than this. And I've seen way too many man babies crying over it. And I'm sorry, they're fucking man babies. Get over it.

33:02.000 --> 33:05.000
The world doesn't revolve around you. We're heading toward equality. Thank you.

33:05.000 --> 33:13.000
Let me ask a tough question that needs to be asked. And this whole thing. And again, you're right. I'm going to dial it back a bit.

33:13.000 --> 33:21.000
Because you're right. As a guy, I don't necessarily always get exposed to the same type of bullshit on Twitter and stuff that women do. And I'll admit that.

33:21.000 --> 33:31.000
But let me ask this. Isn't this a natural cycle of Doctor Who is that any time they announce a new date, like when they announced Matt Smith, it was like, he's too fucking young.

33:32.000 --> 33:41.000
And when they announced Peter Capaldi, he's too fucking old. And then it's like, everybody always fucking comes around once the show is on air. And it's like, it really wasn't that bad.

33:41.000 --> 33:49.000
Would it be okay? And I'm not asking this for myself, but I'm asking this as the person who does interviews on the show.

33:49.000 --> 34:02.000
Is it okay to be criticizing the new Doctor Who based on the writing, the show's creative direction, the things that other doctors in the past are criticized on? Is that an okay criticism?

34:02.000 --> 34:07.000
Well, absolutely. You know, I'm perfect. I'm super happy that Moffat's out of the picture now.

34:08.000 --> 34:12.000
I felt weird because I'm like, actually, most people I see are really happy about Moffat being gone.

34:12.000 --> 34:23.000
Because, well, he was another one of those, you know, stupid man babies who can't write a woman to save his life other than failing every aspect of the Bechdel test.

34:23.000 --> 34:32.000
But the thing I'm getting more on is just people fully attacking having a woman as the doctor.

34:32.000 --> 34:43.000
Yeah, and please do not get me wrong. Don't fucking misunderstand my line of questioning here because like the whole, and I saw the quotes about the whole, the TARDIS full of bras and stuff where I just like, like, it's laughably stupid.

34:43.000 --> 34:58.000
Like, it's just like, wow, people are really stupid. And you know, there's just like comment sections on the internet and stuff. But I also kind of recognize you, there's a line, like if you're criticizing the new Doctor Who just because Doctor Who's a woman, like, get over it. Bye.

34:58.000 --> 35:07.000
There's this meme going around that's the Doctor Who announcement bingo. Every single one of those comments on there I've seen. I could have had a full card by now.

35:07.000 --> 35:19.000
And it's like, I don't even, I don't even care about their opinions anymore. The moment that they bring it up just as a factor of gender, their opinion is immediately invalid. End of story.

35:19.000 --> 35:26.000
I don't even entertain it. I don't talk to them about it. They're instantly one of those people. And they're not worth my time.

35:26.000 --> 35:34.000
And I, maybe I just kind of also feel removed a little bit from this because I just, I don't watch a lot of TV. I haven't watched Doctor Who since Eccleston was the Doctor.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
That was a long time ago.

35:36.000 --> 35:42.000
I was sad when David Tennant left, but I supported his decision to leave and I was looking forward to seeing what the new one would be like.

35:42.000 --> 35:49.000
Yeah, people, Sean Connery wasn't James Bond forever and you know, actors move on from roles. They don't want to get typecast or any of that stuff.

35:49.000 --> 35:54.000
I was perfectly happy when the Master was a woman, although I'd really like for them to bring back the Ronnie because he was awesome.

35:54.000 --> 35:59.000
But I don't know what any of that means. I'm sorry. I just, I really don't.

35:59.000 --> 36:08.000
The Master is like a long term, not really so much rival, just like the, what's the word I'm thinking of?

36:08.000 --> 36:18.000
I guess enemy, but a little bit more personal than that. But it's just stupid. It's stupid. So stupid.

36:18.000 --> 36:27.000
Why are people so hung up about what's between someone's fucking legs? Get over it. Just fucking get over people.

36:27.000 --> 36:35.000
You people who believe that a person's gender is what determines their quality of an individual, you are a relic.

36:35.000 --> 36:43.000
You are going the way of the fucking dinosaur, which by the way, we were wrong about the fucking dinosaurs, but we're not wrong about you because dinosaurs had feathers.

36:44.000 --> 36:56.000
All of these people, they're relics. Their time has passed. They're holding on to something that they're never going to recapture again because they're being left behind.

36:56.000 --> 37:01.000
People are learning that their way of thinking is wrong and people don't like being proven wrong.

37:01.000 --> 37:15.000
And don't get me wrong, I also want to make crystal clear, despite some of my tough questions, representation absolutely matters, you know, and not everybody out there necessarily gets it who's been represented very well for years and years and years.

37:15.000 --> 37:28.000
But like, I think it says a lot when you see that clip, and I don't know if you guys have seen this on Twitter, there's like a little girl who's watching the reveal the Doctor Who thing and just the way her face lights up at the end when she goes, Doctor, who's a girl?

37:28.000 --> 37:42.000
Like, you know, that shit matters, you know, and representation is important. Absolutely. So I just want to make that clear, because some people may take issue with some of those questions I was asking, but I just kind of what I wanted to draw just like a very clear line between the two types of criticisms.

37:42.000 --> 37:56.000
If it's something about writing a direction that I don't mind. Yeah. But if it's just based on if it's just how can Doctor Who be a woman, it's like, watch the first couple episodes and find out or my understanding is they've already set the framework for this.

37:56.000 --> 38:12.000
Most people were like, we saw this coming. Yeah. Yeah. We didn't talk about it for years. Yeah. So you see women can go to medical school as well. And then get out. Yes. Oh my god, because my primary care physician hasn't been a woman for like 15 years.

38:12.000 --> 38:27.000
Meaning that my primary care physician is a woman and has been for like 15 years. And the other thing, too, people need to get used to this kind of discussion happening, because it's not fucking going away until people get over this antiquated idea of gender role.

38:27.000 --> 38:32.000
Until women get paid an equal wage. We're going to keep talking about it. Yeah.

38:33.000 --> 38:43.000
All right, let's move on, shall we? Let's talk about back to video games. But I understand that there's there's a lot of people talk about that today. So I understand.

38:43.000 --> 39:00.000
And yeah, there's a lot of and just because I don't watch Doctor Who I know there's a lot of great shows on the voice geeks network. They do watch Doctor Who and they talk a lot about the different episodes. And that's, that's part of the reason why we built this network because, you know, I can't be an expert in everything geek.

39:00.000 --> 39:16.000
I know games. I know a lot about the games when it comes to television and stuff. That's why we got that's why we got critical myth and British invaders and pod culture like that. That's that's days, days department. So I'll be tuning into those shows to see what they think about all this.

39:16.000 --> 39:26.000
Meanwhile, though, let's talk about video games, since that's what we do here, usually, and talk about our gaming weeks. What types of video games have you been playing this week? Dark Sakura?

39:27.000 --> 39:41.000
I've been playing lots of Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2, because it's really freaking fun. And it's almost as much fun as watching the show, which includes a lot of just screaming. Just screaming. It's great. Really good stress relief, too.

39:41.000 --> 39:57.000
And I've been playing Dragon Ball Dokkan Battle on iOS and Miitomo, Pokemon Go, and not much of anything else. I've really been very busy.

39:58.000 --> 40:01.000
Okie dokie. No DDR while you got the foot in the boot.

40:02.000 --> 40:15.000
Actually, I'm I'm going to be when this comes off. I need to find a good machine locally so I can use that to because I'm so restless with this fucking thing on that. Like, I just want to go out and play.

40:16.000 --> 40:24.000
I wouldn't call it local, but I really especially when you live in the south of here. But when an elk south of here, it's Elk Grove.

40:25.000 --> 40:35.000
I don't like to totally give away personal information. You're right. It's a big there's like 90,000 people live there. I know. But anyway, but like strikes is up in Rocklin.

40:36.000 --> 40:44.000
It's the fuck far away. No, but it's it's kind of worth it, though, because they got they got a lot of cool stuff there. But you're right for you. It's probably just as fast to go to like Concord.

40:45.000 --> 40:51.000
I'd rather get around one. Yeah, I don't blame you. I don't blame you. All right. Anyway, let's go to Loki. How was your gaming week?

40:52.000 --> 41:01.000
I didn't play anything. I just played me while I played basically just a stupid idle clicker office space game. I actually stopped playing Pokemon Go. I just I don't care enough anymore.

41:02.000 --> 41:06.000
And like I was doing my dailies like I forgot it. Well, I guess I don't do that anymore.

41:07.000 --> 41:13.000
I'm not beholden to this game anymore. Exactly. So I was like, well, it's like, OK, I can go spin the pokestops to get more pokeballs.

41:14.000 --> 41:19.000
I have too many. I have like one hundred and seventy two and I'm not catching anything. And where's my Slurpee?

41:20.000 --> 41:24.000
Alan just walked in and brought me. So you want to sit? No, I'm good. I have cooties.

41:25.000 --> 41:30.000
So, yeah, it was just I didn't play anything, but mainly because I want to work on actually making games.

41:31.000 --> 41:34.000
And then on top of that, I was tired. So that's it.

41:36.000 --> 41:42.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Andrade with VOG Network dot com, use the passphrase input.

41:44.000 --> 41:51.000
Hello. Hi Alan. I grabbed or Rob handed me his mic before he could properly introduce me.

41:52.000 --> 41:59.000
I have a breaking news for from Orange Lounge Foodio. We went to Dutch Brothers yesterday and I wanted to find those Dunkin Donut Oreos.

42:00.000 --> 42:07.000
So I went to Wal-Mart in Rancho Cordova. The website said they had them. I downloaded the app on in-store Wi-Fi and because they weren't there.

42:07.000 --> 42:13.000
Neither were the jelly donut ones. So JD will appreciate this if you're listening. I wanted Oreos.

42:14.000 --> 42:18.000
So you went on a food trip that ended up being a complete bust and you had to willingly go to Wal-Mart to do it.

42:19.000 --> 42:25.000
Yes, I did get, though, the Dunkin Donuts Pop Tarts so you can eat those tomorrow. Yay. Bye.

42:26.000 --> 42:30.000
All right. Thank you for that very important food update. I appreciate it. All right.

42:31.000 --> 42:34.000
Well, that's it for Loki's Gaming Week. I'll talk about my gaming week a little bit.

42:34.000 --> 42:41.000
And, let's see, I already talked about Splatoon 2 and doing the little pre-event there. I only played a couple rounds of it.

42:42.000 --> 42:47.000
And then I was like, oh, well, nothing in this carries over to the main game. Wow, I'm still really terrible at this.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
I'm going to wait and try the single player in Splatoon 2 when it comes out.

42:51.000 --> 42:56.000
But it was fine. It was set up really well. The presentation of this Splatfest was really well done. I will give it that.

42:57.000 --> 43:01.000
Let's see, what else did I play this week? I played Pokemon Go as well, which I already talked about earlier.

43:01.000 --> 43:07.000
And the game that's been taking up the most of my time, well, besides Final Fantasy XIV, which continues to be a thing.

43:08.000 --> 43:16.000
But now I have been playing a lot of Final Fantasy XII, the Zodiac Age, which just came out on Tuesday.

43:17.000 --> 43:23.000
But I got my copy on Friday because I waited to get the Steel Book Edition because I was really stupid and I didn't pre-order.

43:24.000 --> 43:27.000
I thought I had this whole time. Then Tuesday came around and I'm like, where's my shipping notice?

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
Oh, I never bought it. I see, that's what happened.

43:30.000 --> 43:38.000
So I had to wait until Friday to get my Steel Book Edition, but I got the game and I got to say, oh my gosh, Final Fantasy XII has really aged well.

43:39.000 --> 43:45.000
Like, just as a game. Like, wow. I'm having more fun with it now, I think, even the one who was on PlayStation 2 originally.

43:46.000 --> 43:53.000
I really like some of the quality of life changes they've made, how you can kind of have the transparent map that's on your screen by clicking L3.

43:54.000 --> 44:04.000
How you can speed the game up is amazing. You can do double or quadruple time, even, to just make, like, I'm in that area right now.

44:05.000 --> 44:10.000
What do they call it? The Yirba Sands or something, where you're in those big oil towers that are like the giant circles.

44:11.000 --> 44:17.000
And it's not the most pleasant map in the world, but man, when you put that thing on double speed, it's so much easier to grind through.

44:18.000 --> 44:23.000
And yes, man, the speed alone is like a huge quality of life improvement there with that.

44:24.000 --> 44:31.000
But yeah, it's making me really love this game all over again. Like, I love how, you know, XII was the game that came after XI.

44:32.000 --> 44:39.000
So there's MMO-esque elements of it, like multiplayer elements, I would say, but it's not a multiplayer game.

44:40.000 --> 44:47.000
You know, it's definitely a single-player experience, but you program the other people in your party through the Gambit system to be able to do the things you want them to do.

44:48.000 --> 44:52.000
And I just, yeah, I love it. And the battle system is a lot of fun, and I'm really enjoying my way through the game.

44:53.000 --> 45:00.000
If I had any criticisms whatsoever, my real minor complaint would probably be the voice acting, but not what you think.

45:00.000 --> 45:05.000
The voice actors themselves are great, and especially Gideon Emery as Balthier.

45:06.000 --> 45:12.000
I mean, let's be real, Final Fantasy XII is the Balthier and Fran show, and all these other people too.

45:13.000 --> 45:19.000
That's not my complaint. My complaint is the actual quality of the voice acting clips.

45:20.000 --> 45:29.000
That hasn't changed since the PlayStation 2 era, and I think over the orchestrated soundtrack, I can actually hear in some places a little bit of the distortion and a little bit of popping.

45:30.000 --> 45:40.000
And some of the lower quality of the sound bits probably being compressed for PlayStation 2 and now coming over to PlayStation 4, because they certainly didn't have everybody re-record their lines or anything like that.

45:41.000 --> 45:47.000
At the end of the day, that is an extremely minor complaint, but I did tease that I had one minor issue on Twitter, so there it is.

45:48.000 --> 45:59.000
That one relic quality from PlayStation 2 I don't think aged as well, but you can kind of get used to it and tune it out, and that's something you kind of get over at some point.

46:00.000 --> 46:06.000
Oh my gosh, I'm just really enjoying the game and the story. I'm into the story way more than I was the first time, even.

46:07.000 --> 46:12.000
Yeah, so if you're a fan of role-playing games or a fan of Final Fantasy, you really should check this out.

46:13.000 --> 46:19.000
And I know we talked about last week a little bit about accessibility. I don't remember if this was on our phone call with Bobby or if we got into it on our show a little bit.

46:20.000 --> 46:24.000
But I kind of mentioned that Final Fantasy XII may not be the best Final Fantasy game to start with.

46:24.000 --> 46:33.000
I still think maybe Final Fantasy X as far as traditional Final Fantasy games go, but I don't think XII is as hard to get into as I remember.

46:34.000 --> 46:39.000
Or it's something about this game and those quality of life improvements in the year 2017 that make it easier to play.

46:40.000 --> 46:46.000
But I think I'm going to take back a little bit what I said last week. I think if you want to start with Final Fantasy XII, you can.

46:46.000 --> 46:55.000
Just realize that it was the beginning of a newer direction for the series, and it doesn't really reflect the older games prior to it as well.

46:56.000 --> 47:07.000
Again, when Final Fantasy had XI that went MMO, that changed a lot of things about the franchise that even carried on into XII, XIII, and the way Act of Time Battle plays out in XIII.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
And XV, certainly, a lot of that you see as well.

47:10.000 --> 47:21.000
Speaking of XV, by the way, I really think as far as a Final Fantasy experience on Playstation 4 worth waiting for, XII has given it to me in a way XV didn't.

47:22.000 --> 47:30.000
I almost feel like Final Fantasy XII is Final Fantasy XV, which makes no sense at all, but that's how it is in my head.

47:31.000 --> 47:35.000
I'm like, this is the Final Fantasy game I've been waiting for, so that's honestly where I'm at.

47:35.000 --> 47:39.000
I hope you guys that have been playing it are enjoying it as well.

47:40.000 --> 47:43.000
None of you guys have checked it out yet? Any plans to check out the Zodiac gauge?

47:44.000 --> 47:47.000
No? At some point you should. It's a great Final Fantasy title.

47:48.000 --> 47:49.000
Maybe if it's on sale for like 10 bucks or something.

47:50.000 --> 47:51.000
That'll probably happen eventually, who knows.

47:52.000 --> 47:56.000
Let's get into some housekeeping real quick, and then I'm going to get into gaming news.

47:57.000 --> 48:02.000
As far as housekeeping goes tonight, I do want to mention our new Discord server, if you're not already there.

48:03.000 --> 48:12.000
Just go to vognetwork.com slash Discord and you can join our new Discord server, which we have been using to talk about when people are live streaming,

48:13.000 --> 48:18.000
throw article ideas back and forth, tell you when new podcasts go up from all the shows on the network, and it's great.

48:19.000 --> 48:22.000
We have over 40 people on the Discord already, which is awesome.

48:22.000 --> 48:29.000
It's been growing. Welcome to those of you guys that want to join with us over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

48:30.000 --> 48:33.000
We're also on Twitter, Twitter.com slash O-L-R, and we're on Facebook as well.

48:34.000 --> 48:39.000
Now I think it's time we get into some gaming news. Loki, tell us about what's been going on in gaming news this week.

48:40.000 --> 48:46.000
There's a brand new subscription service for indie games called JUMP, which is coming out very soon.

48:46.000 --> 48:55.000
They're going to be running a closed beta for it until July 24th. They're planning on launching the service with 60 to 100 indie games,

48:56.000 --> 49:01.000
and for $10 a month you get access to play those games, so that's kind of neat.

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
$10 isn't very expensive either.

49:05.000 --> 49:13.000
No, it's not. Basically, they're saying the way indie developers will be paid out on that will be based on how much time subscribers play their games.

49:13.000 --> 49:24.000
So that's kind of neat. I like this a little bit better than, say, the humble indie, the humble monthly that they do.

49:25.000 --> 49:35.000
Because it's humble monthly, you don't know what you're getting, and with someone with 500 Steam games, you're likely to run into duplicates sometimes.

49:36.000 --> 49:45.000
So this is kind of cool that you get to play all that, but once again, because I do have so many games in my backlog, I probably wouldn't actually want to pay for a service like this,

49:46.000 --> 49:50.000
because, you know, I just would not have time to play any of this.

49:51.000 --> 49:52.000
But it's cool, though.

49:53.000 --> 49:56.000
I love that something like it exists. It really reminds me of GameTap.

49:56.000 --> 49:57.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

49:58.000 --> 50:02.000
How many years ago was GameTap? That feels like forever ago now. That was at least...

50:03.000 --> 50:06.000
That had to be like almost 10 years ago at this point, when GameTap was kind of...

50:07.000 --> 50:14.000
Here's the other cool thing, though, with that. They have it broken down, so with that, you get a library of PC, Mac, Vive, and Oculus Rift games.

50:15.000 --> 50:20.000
So not only are you getting traditional PC games, but you're also getting VR games, which is kind of cool.

50:21.000 --> 50:24.000
Wasn't that supposed to be the concept behind the Phantom console, too? Remember that?

50:24.000 --> 50:28.000
I don't think there was a concept. It was just a console that you were going to download.

50:29.000 --> 50:33.000
No, they had an E3 booth one year, remember? They had a whole console.

50:34.000 --> 50:42.000
I remember they got made fun of a lot for that, but I think it was the fact that it was a console dedicated to all this stuff. I don't even remember.

50:43.000 --> 50:48.000
Can somebody remind me, why did we hate the Phantom? Or did we? It's been so many years.

50:49.000 --> 50:50.000
It's just so ephemeral.

50:51.000 --> 50:56.000
I think it was because that system was a couple hundred dollars, and you still had to pay a monthly fee on top of it.

50:57.000 --> 51:03.000
Because it was like a PC that you would download games to, and it's like, but I have a PC. Why do I need another PC to do this?

51:04.000 --> 51:08.000
I guess that's true. Going to chat over at live.vog.network.com, MXC says,

51:09.000 --> 51:14.000
It takes like 10 to 20 seconds to launch the games within JMP's client. Once in, they run pretty well, though.

51:15.000 --> 51:21.000
I noticed some occasional lag, at least on my internet, lol. So, some people in chat are already using the service, it sounds like.

51:22.000 --> 51:23.000
Very cool. That's kind of neat.

51:24.000 --> 51:29.000
Yeah, in fact, if you are interested in checking it out, they're saying the service is going to be coming later this summer.

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
And if you want to check it out, playonjump.com.

51:33.000 --> 51:39.000
Oh, so they must, because one of our members is saying they're in there, so they're having like a beta trial or something?

51:40.000 --> 51:41.000
Yeah, they're doing a beta right now until the 24th.

51:42.000 --> 51:43.000
Oh, that's cool. So you can jump into the beta.

51:44.000 --> 51:51.000
Nice. I might have to check that out, just to see what all's there. You never know what cool little indie game you might find on there.

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
Yeah, there might be some stuff that's kind of ehhh.

51:55.000 --> 51:56.000
They said it's highly curated.

51:57.000 --> 52:02.000
Really? So they don't just let anybody come on the service, they seek stuff out?

52:03.000 --> 52:08.000
I don't really know how it works. You can submit your game if you want to, so you can send them a submission.

52:09.000 --> 52:15.000
But like, I'm just trying to see some of the stuff they have in the background here. It looks like Moleman must die.

52:16.000 --> 52:20.000
They're trying to screen out like Fart Simulator 2017.

52:21.000 --> 52:22.000
Right, it's not going to be any of that bullshit.

52:23.000 --> 52:24.000
I gotcha, I gotcha. That's good.

52:25.000 --> 52:32.000
MXC says the beta only has about 8 games so far, but the official launch will have 20 or so, at least that's the plan.

52:33.000 --> 52:36.000
MXC continues they have some great games like A Wizard's Lizard.

52:37.000 --> 52:42.000
I think I saw a Grinder Profile titled that once. A Wizard's Lizard and The Bridge.

52:43.000 --> 52:47.000
There you go. Are some of the games that are, I shouldn't make, I don't even know what this game is.

52:48.000 --> 52:52.000
I'm sorry to the creator of Wizard's Lizard, but you have to admit that's a pretty fucking funny title.

52:53.000 --> 52:54.000
Dark Saga's trying not to laugh over there.

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
Are you a fan of the Wizard Lizard?

52:57.000 --> 53:03.000
Alright, I'm curious, here's my curiosity.

53:04.000 --> 53:08.000
Raginator is like the deals guy here at pretty much VOG.

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
I would say OLR, he calls in a Bobby show all the time too.

53:12.000 --> 53:15.000
If Game Buoy and Electric Sisterhood took calls he'd probably call in to them too.

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
To talk about what video games are on sale.

53:19.000 --> 53:22.000
So my question to Raginator is, is this a deal for you?

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
Because you're saying in chat, enough games, enough games, dude there's no such thing.

53:25.000 --> 53:31.000
So Raginator, like $10 a month to play all the, well not all the games.

53:32.000 --> 53:33.000
Like 80 to 100 games.

53:34.000 --> 53:38.000
A buffet, a Las Vegas buffet of indie games, is that a deal?

53:39.000 --> 53:44.000
And I'm pinpointing Raginator, but I really open that up to everybody. Is that a deal?

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
And here's what they said about the internet speed too since we were talking about earlier.

53:48.000 --> 53:53.000
You know, how your internet speed may affect playing games like Splatoon 2.

53:53.000 --> 53:56.000
And how you might now be able to play online because you get banned because you're dropping out.

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
They said the internet, and what internet speed do I need?

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
Don't worry, any old broadband connection speed will do.

54:03.000 --> 54:04.000
That only affects the initial loading of games.

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
So while it may take longer to using dial up at grandma's house.

54:08.000 --> 54:11.000
After loading the game, plays locally on your desktop.

54:12.000 --> 54:13.000
No need for super fast connection.

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
Although it will make your initial game loads super fast.

54:17.000 --> 54:20.000
Most games load in under 60 seconds on a 15 megabit connection.

54:20.000 --> 54:23.000
So it's downloading the entire game. It's not streaming the whole thing.

54:24.000 --> 54:25.000
That makes sense.

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
And MXC is clarifying to be fair to the creators of a wizard's lizard.

54:29.000 --> 54:30.000
It is Zelda inspired.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
Now you have my attention.

54:34.000 --> 54:37.000
I'm assuming that means old school Zelda, not like 3D Zelda.

54:38.000 --> 54:41.000
It's dangerous to go alone. Take my wizard's lizard.

54:51.000 --> 54:52.000
Good night everybody.

54:53.000 --> 54:54.000
You've been listening to Orange...

54:55.000 --> 54:56.000
Alright, I'm kidding. Alright.

54:57.000 --> 55:01.000
Let's see, going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

55:02.000 --> 55:06.000
Raginator says, I'm not really into reading games. I want to outright own the games.

55:07.000 --> 55:11.000
Oh, a little difference there. I want to amass that collection of these are mine.

55:12.000 --> 55:13.000
That's what it seems for.

55:14.000 --> 55:15.000
That's what it seems for.

55:15.000 --> 55:19.000
I mean, see him and like, hey, if you want cheap games and what they had like today,

55:20.000 --> 55:21.000
I want to say, I think it was bundle stars.

55:22.000 --> 55:25.000
They had, what was it? Skullgirls with the DLC for a dollar.

55:26.000 --> 55:27.000
Can't beat that.

55:30.000 --> 55:31.000
Alright, moving on.

55:32.000 --> 55:33.000
Let's go to some more stories.

55:34.000 --> 55:35.000
Let's talk about Nintendo Switch.

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
I have my own little buffet of Nintendo Switch updates, actually.

55:39.000 --> 55:43.000
A few things to note about the Nintendo Switch as the library of games is growing and growing.

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
I think it's really nice and relieving to see.

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
It looks like the Switch is not facing the curse of the Wii U.

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
We still have a steady stream of games coming out for the Switch.

55:52.000 --> 55:56.000
And good news, the Jackbox Party Pack 3, which was already released on the Nintendo Switch,

55:57.000 --> 56:02.000
I'm imagining must be doing well enough that it was announced by Jackbox Games.

56:03.000 --> 56:04.000
We've only had them on the show twice.

56:05.000 --> 56:11.000
Jackbox Games on Twitter mention that the Jackbox Party Pack 1 and 2 are also coming to the Nintendo Switch.

56:11.000 --> 56:18.000
So, whereas, yeah, okay, if you have PlayStation 4 or Xbox One or even Steam, you've probably already picked these up.

56:19.000 --> 56:25.000
But, there is something awfully convenient about the Switch, being able to put that on the tabletop and instant party.

56:26.000 --> 56:29.000
So, these games are kind of getting a second life of sorts all through the Nintendo Switch.

56:30.000 --> 56:33.000
So, those games are coming out on Nintendo Switch, so that's pretty cool.

56:34.000 --> 56:40.000
They didn't say when, but I'm assuming before the holiday or the good old fashioned soon.

56:41.000 --> 56:46.000
I don't know if you guys have checked out Cave Story Plus, but that recently came out on the Nintendo Switch.

56:47.000 --> 56:51.000
And, in August, they are going to be patching in a classic graphics mode.

56:52.000 --> 56:56.000
So, in August, you will be able to switch between the new graphics and the classic graphics.

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
So, that's pretty cool. A little perk for people that own that game.

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
I'm loving how much, have you noticed this?

57:03.000 --> 57:08.000
A lot of the Nintendo Switch games have really been getting, like, really strong post-release support.

57:08.000 --> 57:12.000
And, I think that's important too. Like, we talked about Blaster Master Zero last week.

57:13.000 --> 57:18.000
The Bomberman game, even though I didn't like it, you know, they have Pyramid Head Bomberman in there now.

57:19.000 --> 57:20.000
Like, they have all this crazy stuff in there.

57:21.000 --> 57:22.000
And, now you see the Cave Story is getting stuff.

57:23.000 --> 57:27.000
I really like that these games are getting well supported past their launch. That's pretty cool.

57:28.000 --> 57:31.000
And, I love this. A little follow up to something we talked about last week.

57:32.000 --> 57:35.000
Pac-Man Versus is coming out on Nintendo Switch. We already talked about that last week.

57:35.000 --> 57:41.000
But, what if you only have one copy of the game, but you still want to be able to play the game?

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
Because you're going to need two Switches to really play the game to its full potential.

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
Where one Switch is Pac-Man, the other Switch is the ghost.

57:48.000 --> 57:49.000
Well, here's what's pretty cool about it.

57:50.000 --> 57:54.000
Even though there's no download play on the Nintendo Switch, like you have on the 3DS,

57:55.000 --> 58:03.000
Bandai Namco, their solution for Namco Museum is to release a new title on the eShop called Pac-Man Versus

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
Free Multiplayer Only Version.

58:06.000 --> 58:10.000
And, with this app on your Switch, it will talk to the game on somebody else's Switch

58:11.000 --> 58:14.000
and allow you to have one copy of the game playable on two Switches.

58:15.000 --> 58:19.000
So, it is a little bit of a work around, but hey, you know, good guy Bandai Namco in this case

58:20.000 --> 58:24.000
putting this together so that you wouldn't have to have two copies of the game in order to play Pac-Man Versus

58:25.000 --> 58:29.000
the way it's really intended. So, lots of exciting stuff on the Steam front. Very, very cool.

58:29.000 --> 58:32.000
Alright, let's move on. Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

58:33.000 --> 58:40.000
Kingdom Hearts 3. Yes, because Squenix can count to three, unlike some other companies out there.

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
Well, to be fair, it hasn't been released yet.

58:44.000 --> 58:49.000
And, to be fair, they also use a little weird number system that has all these weird fractions and shit.

58:50.000 --> 58:53.000
2.8, 2.5 Final HD. Alright, sorry Jamie.

58:54.000 --> 59:01.000
Anyway, so we have, though, some new world announcements, including a couple of gameplay trailers.

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
So, the one I'm really excited about is the Toy Story one.

59:05.000 --> 59:13.000
Because, how, we haven't had any Pixar presence, I think, in any of the Kingdom Hearts games to my memory.

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
I don't recall either. I don't think so.

59:16.000 --> 59:23.000
I'm about as giddy as this, almost as I was giddy for Tron World, which was based off of the original Tron.

59:24.000 --> 59:29.000
Right. I think they did Tron Legacy in the DS game, the 3DS game. Dream Drop Distance, I think they did.

59:30.000 --> 59:39.000
But, with all that, the way it looked, the way the characters looked in that trailer was as good as they did in the first Toy Story movie. It's crazy.

59:39.000 --> 59:43.000
Well, I was also noticing some of the other background elements, too.

59:44.000 --> 59:50.000
Like, first of all, the environment felt like it wasn't just background. They felt like part of the background.

59:51.000 --> 59:56.000
And, even outside, the grass looked freaking real. Everything, the light sourcing was amazing.

59:57.000 --> 01:00:01.000
I was really, really pleased. Of course, the voice acting was all in Japanese.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:11.000
I always loved the Japanese Donald voice actor, because he just sounds so perfect. He sounds identical either way. It's great listening to it.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:24.000
But, I'm really, really, really pleased by it. Apparently, they're also going to have Hercules, Big Hero 6, and Tangled in some of these worlds, which I'm also equally happy about.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:30.000
So, really, really pleased with it. And, that and I like that they come out looking like toys.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:36.000
You know, their little outfits are toy bodies. I think that's cute.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Yeah, I have to admit. I had heard about, they announced, I think the Toy Story was new this week. They talked about Big Hero 6 before. They didn't say a lot.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.000
But, that was still, they're going to explore, I guess, a Marvel property with that.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:59.000
It's weird that they're recycling Hercules. And, fuck James Woods, after this week, seriously. Fuck him. So, I'm not excited about that.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:03.000
But, as far as, you know, the rest of those announcements, it's pretty cool.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.000
I'm pretty pleased.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Yeah, yeah. And then, oh, did you see at the end of the trailer, Jamie, at the very end, at the very, very, very end, it says, coming in 2018.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Right. I saw that.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:22.000
To which a lot of skeptical gamers are saying, hahaha, that's a good one.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Well, the other game I want is coming out next year too.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000
What's that?

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000
The Dragon Ball FighterZ?

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Oh, yeah, that will actually happen. That hasn't been in development for like 18 years.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Or, what's that gift from Titanic? It's been 84 years, or whatever it is she says in that movie.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
It's how long it's been waiting for Kingdom Hearts 3.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:45.000
And, here's the thing, I've also seen other people that are like, why are people so cynical about the 2018 release date?

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.000
It's like, come on.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Because it's a square we're talking about.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:53.000
It's not even just that it's square. It's that it's square and it's a video game.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:58.000
I mean, hello, every week on this show, every week on this show we have news about some game getting delayed.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000
In fact, I'm pretty sure we have some this week.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.000
I know we do. I know we have one during Rapid Fire News, at least.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
So, it just, it happens in this industry.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.000
And I'm not saying, oh, I'm not saying like Kingdom Hearts 3 is gonna suck, because actually that's fine.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000
If they have to delay the game to make a great game, then it's fine.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
But I just, I don't get excited over timeframes anymore.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Anybody remember that Persona 5 trailer that said it was gonna be on the PS3 in like 2014?

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Remember that? I mean, games don't always make their dates and it happens.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.000
So, anyway, hopefully Kingdom Hearts will be awesome when it finally does come out.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.000
So, I'm excited about that.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
But there's lots of awesome stuff at D23.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.000
There was.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Yeah, the Tron ride coming to Orlando. Excited about that.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Very excited to check that out.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Was there any other gaming stuff?

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Yeah, they showed off Battlefront 2, because I actually caught some of it.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:58.000
They showed off Battlefront 2, they showed off, what else, a little bit more of Spider-Man.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:07.000
They talked about, they had like a reveal of another character that you can play on Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2 game,

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:12.000
which is the homemade Spider-Man suit from the new movie.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Which I'm like, who cares? I mean, I kind of figured that would be in there anyways, but whatever.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:30.000
And much like E3, it was chock full of influencers, if you will.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Disney has influencers?

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:34.000
No, YouTube personalities.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Oh, God. Alright.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:45.000
So, it was hosted, they had Jacksepticeye doing hosting and then they had Markiplier in there later on and a whole bunch of other people I don't give a shit about.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:49.000
But, it was cringey at moments.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.000
I'm going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com. I have to address this comment.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
So, sta100matt in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:03.000
So, Mighty No. 9 gets tons of shit for delays, is a great game, but Kingdom Hearts 3 gets delayed and we have to gloss over it?

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Nobody should be, except from, I think it's exempt from getting shit on for multiple delays.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
Was Mighty No. 9 a good game? I don't remember hearing that part of it.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.000
The juries, I think that's the whole opinion. There's an opinion there.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.000
But, that's not even it for me. I'm going to tell you the difference there, Matt.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:27.000
The Mighty No. 9 team took your money up front telling you the game was going to be out in a certain time frame.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:32.000
I haven't paid a dollar for Kingdom Hearts yet, just like I haven't paid a dollar for Smash Brothers or any of that other stuff yet.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:40.000
And, I think in the case of Mighty No. 9, it isn't just the fact that it got delayed, but it just seems like that Kickstarter.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Again, I didn't donate money to it, so I haven't been on the forefront of this. Although, I will say this, I did finally buy the game.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:52.000
I just haven't played it yet. It's in my Steam backlog. I bought Mighty No. 9 in that recent Steam sale because I was like, I just want to see.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:57.000
I want to make my own judgment on this. At least I can say that. I'm going to make my own damn judgment on this.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
And, I'm not going to necessarily believe the internet one way or the other.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:08.000
But, my understanding is those Kickstarter guys still fulfilling rewards. How long has that game been out now?

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:12.000
And, I'm hearing the last of the physical rewards just now going out.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Because it came out last July?

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:24.000
So, I think there's a little bit of apples and oranges going on there. And, the biggest part of it is that, again, they took your money up front promising a certain time frame.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:33.000
But, to be fair, so did Bloodstained. So did a lot of Kickstarters out there. But, I think this is why you're seeing a trend.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:43.000
I think more and more Kickstarters are having difficulty now if they aren't somebody with an established presence because of what these Kickstarters before have done.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Now, when Mighty No. 9 was a thing, nobody knew what to expect from Kickstarters.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:56.000
But, now, it's almost like it's the same, and I'm using my quotey fingers, joke with Kickstarters. It's going to get delayed 100 times.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Here's the thing, and let's be fair here. We only hear about these Kickstarters when they're a shit show like this.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
We don't hear about all the stuff that is successfully gone through.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:14.000
And, I'm sure there's lots and lots of games that don't really hit the spotlight that have been Kickstarted and released just fine.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:18.000
And, nobody's really talking about it because they weren't asking for a ton of money up front.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:25.000
They released a good game or a decent game on time, and probably people playing it now don't even realize it was a Kickstarted game.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:32.000
So, I don't want to say that all projects like that, but we can't take just, okay, this person's pedigree.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:42.000
They made good games in the past with the publisher, and now they're releasing their own game that they're going to know what the fuck they're doing because that's been proven wrong a lot so far.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:52.000
So, we just can't take that for granted, and you just have to see, in the end, is it something that you feel like putting your money towards the development on? Do you have confidence?

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.000
And, I mean, sometimes you're wrong.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Lizard Wizard in chat over at live.fognetwork.com says,

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
OLR never talked about the failure of Project Rap Rabbit.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Actually, I think the day before the campaign ended, I talked a little bit about it on the show.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.000
They didn't show anything from it.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:18.000
They finally, towards the end of the campaign, they finally had like a concept reel that I think was in-game footage, but maybe not. It might have been rendered. I'm not sure.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Anyway, here's my whole thing with that. Since you brought it up, I was actually going to bring that up anyway, but I would actually say Project Rap Rabbit is probably the first big victim, I would say, of a Kickstarter burnout that's happening, I think, in the gaming community.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:43.000
I think if they did Project Rap Rabbit two years ago, before Amplitude ever happened, I think if they had tried to do it then, I think it would have succeeded.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:47.000
I think I might have backed it. I don't know. It's hard to say in retrospect.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:08:00.000
But I think a large reason why that game failed, A, they had an expectation because of all these, I still think, and I think some of the big fans of that game are going to really not agree with what I'm saying,

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:10.000
but you just, you really feel it in the sense of how long they held off on certain things and how they ran that whole Kickstarter. There was an arrogance around that Kickstarter.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:19.000
I can't think of a better word. There was an arrogance around that Kickstarter that they were going to make their money, and I think that showed a little bit, which is why I'm using that word.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.000
And I think that's part of the reason why they didn't make their money.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Shenmue 3, have we seen anything from that yet?

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:34.000
No. Oh, no. You know, and I think because of all of this, Mighty No. 9, Shenmue, Bloodstained, you name it, a lot of these high-profile Kickstarters that...

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.000
They didn't show footage at E3 of Bloodstained, and it apparently looked really good, but...

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Yeah, I'm still... I did back Bloodstained. Would I do it again? I don't know, but I did back it, and it is looking good. I'm hoping maybe this is one that can kind of buck the trend and maybe make Kickstarters great again.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Like, there's a game, one that I've been seeing a lot on channels when they're talking about other stuff, so Fight Night was one. It's a game that's kind of got that old...

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Like a retro first-person shooter-type game, but you're playing as a knight that all you do is you punch things. And it's got a really cool aesthetic to it, and it went through Kickstarter, and I think it's been doing pretty well.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:20.000
And games like that, they release a demo along with the Kickstarter, so you kind of at least get to try it out and see if it's something that you want to...

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Does this look good? Is this something you're going to be wanting in the backing instead of just basing it off of video? Pictures?

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:43.000
So anyway, yeah. The Rap Rabbit thing was just... It's a bummer, but I think there was a lot in there about how not to do your Kickstarter. Sorry.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:51.000
But releasing gameplay concepts more than halfway in your campaign, that was a big no-no. That should have been a day-one thing.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:10:01.000
And I think more people are going to have success on Kickstarter, like, okay, so talking about successful Kickstarters and things, and to be fair, let's talk about some good.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:11.000
So we had that guy on the show a couple months ago from... Tangle Deep was the name of the game, and he is from OC Remix, right?

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Yes, we had him on the show, right? And I actually backed that game, and I'm getting a lot of updates for it, and it seems like that game is on target.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:29.000
But if you remember, when he was on the show, he talked about his game was pretty much already done, and it was coming out no matter what, but this was helping him do that final push.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:37.000
It was the extra stuff he wanted to put in the game, and it was kind of like the distribution stuff. I think that was, in many ways, the right way to do a Kickstarter.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:41.000
You already have your product ready to go. This is just now that final push.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:49.000
And here's the best part about Kickstarter, though. If your project fails on Kickstarter, learn from your mistakes and do another one.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:58.000
If, for example, Project Rap Rabbit, the problem was that there was no gameplay, there was nothing there, it was just kind of concepts at the 11th hour,

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:07.000
then maybe put some more stuff into your game, show some of what you have, and then do it again. I mean, no harm, no foul, I guess.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:13.000
It's just when you make a game and you get funded and you don't release the game, then that's the problem.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:19.000
SSJ100Matt says, Shovel Knight is the best case scenario and should be the standard of video game Kickstarter campaigns.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:25.000
And that's a good news thing we can talk about, I think, when it comes to Kickstarter. It doesn't all have to be bad news, for sure.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:28.000
And I think Yooka-Laylee was not so bad, from what I hear.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:34.000
Yeah, I didn't pick that up myself, but I'm not hearing a lot of complaints about it. I think the people who funded it are enjoying it.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:40.000
So, anyway. Alright, let's move on, though. We got plenty more to talk about than just what's going on on Kickstarter. Loki.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Alright, so there's a lot of VR news this week, especially Oculus.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Oculus announced that they're going to be creating a standalone Oculus headset that's going to release next year.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:03.000
And it's going to be about $200. They're saying that the tech in it is going to be kind of similar to maybe a Gear VR.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:09.000
So, I mean, I don't know. For $200, I would assume it's going to be like a Gear VR type thing.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:15.000
But it's basically, it's not going to require a phone or anything like that. It's just going to be its own deal.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:21.000
So that's going to be kind of neat. And especially $200, I mean, that's a pretty nice entry point.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
So we'll have to see what that looks like coming next year.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:28.000
The other stuff, though, in the meantime, this is a really good deal.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:34.000
I mean, honestly, I'm thinking about jumping in on this. I just have to see if I have enough spare money to afford it right now.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:46.000
But right now, between now and I think it's going to be running for six weeks, the Oculus Rift bundle on PC platforms is running $399.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:51.000
So that's an Oculus Rift headset as well as two of the touch controllers.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:55.000
And they're even including several games as well. That's $200 off the regular price.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Nice.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Fucking awesome. And on top of that, when the deal is up, they are going to be dropping the price down to $500 instead of the, what is it, I think it's $599 right now.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:14.000
So they're going to be dropping in $100 permanently after the whole thing's done.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:21.000
But, I mean, dude, that's, just seeing this, and we're going to kind of get into some more stories later.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:28.000
A lot of companies are jumping on board VR, and I think it's really going to start taking off this year, probably next year.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:36.000
Yeah, but I'm still worried about everybody trying to do VR their own way, and that we have a real, diluted pool here.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:38.000
I don't have room for 10 headsets in my house.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:43.000
Right. I think right now it's kind of between the Oculus, obviously the Oculus and the Vive.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:54.000
I don't know, I know Lenovo's been doing, they have some other Lenovo headsets and stuff, and Microsoft is supposed to be partnering different people for different headsets, but I think, I don't have a problem.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:56.000
PlayStation VR, of course.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:08.000
Well, yeah, PlayStation VR. I think, though, this is good, though, that they're dropping the price like this, and it's helping push sales, because if they see those higher sales with this price point, it's only going to help, competition will bring that price down.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:19.000
And that, I think, especially when this headset comes out standalone for $200, it may not be as cutting edge as this, which is okay, because not everybody's PC can run VR stuff as is.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:31.000
And so, if this lower price headset isn't as demanding as other things, then maybe that's a good thing to get people really introduced into VR.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:39.000
Because it's one of those things, like, once you try it, you kind of become a believer of it. So, I don't know, I'm interested to see where it's going to go.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:53.000
Yeah, I think this is a nice, like, we knew eventually the price of the technology would start to come down a little bit, it would allow the price to come back a little bit, and now it's getting a little more like, okay, now this is something that, you know, more and more people might start adopting, so this is pretty exciting.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:15:00.000
I am seriously, though, thinking about that bundle, because, like, now that my laptop can do VR, it's like, ooh.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Well, maybe this is something maybe to sway you, and surely you've seen stuff on this, Loki. Something else that was announced at the D23 Expo was Marvel Powers United VR, and this is actually a partnership, I guess, between Oculus and Disney Marvel.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:30.000
So, I guess this is something where you get to, it's a four-player action game, you take on the role of your favorite Marvel hero, and you work together to complete missions, and you face off against bad guys and all that good stuff.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.000
Yeah, it looked kind of cool.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:38.000
Sanzaru Games is building it, they were behind VR Sports Challenge and Ripcoil, if you've played those games.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:54.000
There's 12 playable characters, I guess they're supposed to be in the game, and so far you've seen Captain Marvel, Rocket Raccoon, and I guess the Hulk, sounds like was also there, so already a better roster than Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:59.000
I think they're actually all in Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Alright, alright, bad joke. But anyway, no X-Men yet, that's a problem. Anyway, all that joking aside though, the VR stuff, yeah, looks like it would be pretty cool. This is something that I definitely want to play.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:20.000
Dark Soccer, would you check out a game, oh maybe not, maybe because I know you're not big on the VR stuff because of the motion and everything, but you could be Rocket Raccoon.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:22.000
That's okay.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
You actually see his nose, which is kind of annoying, but you do have that.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:31.000
No, I really don't care if it's VR, I'm not really going to play it every time of day.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:35.000
But I remember at Gamer X you played a VR game you liked, so there's some stuff.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
It was good, I liked it, but I couldn't.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
But it was also not high intensity, something like this is high intensity, something like that.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:51.000
Well this is high intensity, but it's not moving around a lot, it's more of just kind of standing there and shooting things. Like if you've ever played, you might like, what was that, Robot Recall thing.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:55.000
Where there's not really a lot of movement, it's teleporting different spots.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:59.000
I still don't think I would like it very much, I don't like to be without my glasses.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:01.000
Well you could wear your glasses though.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:03.000
I thought these headsets allowed you to wear your glasses.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.000
I'm really not into VR.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:07.000
Yeah, I don't know.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:11.000
The teleport thing is how they're doing Doom and some of the...

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:20.000
I don't like it honestly, I don't mind, I don't get motion sick from that stuff and I don't really care for the teleporting, I would rather just be able to move.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:22.000
Give me the option.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:28.000
As long as I do it in little doses, I'm fine. I can't do a VR game for like an hour, but I can do it for like 20 minutes.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:30.000
But I'm good.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:37.000
I would like a sequel to, what was it, Until Dawn Rush of Blood, please, because that game is awesome.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:46.000
I'll just keep playing that. I'm looking for more games, in fact actually one of the stories we'll have later on is a game I'm picking up and one I've been waiting for for PlayStation VR.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
Alright, well let's move on so we can get there. But first, Dark Sakura.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:18:04.000
Well, there is something that I don't know quite to think about it, but for anyone who is a fan of River City Ransom, the game River City Ransom Underground was taken off of Steam because of a DMCA claim.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:20.000
And just trying to get a little bit more going on is that, basically, I'm not quite sure why because I think it was also involved in a YouTube thing. There's been some updates since I read this originally.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
This actually follows something up from last week.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:29.000
Yeah. I'm actually trying to find out because, like I said, it's been updated since I read it.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:37.000
But basically, they're trying to get the DMCA retracted so that they can get it back on Steam.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:46.000
And now there's something about a restraining order going on? Yeah, I'm like way behind on this one since I read it.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:54.000
I was going to say, do you remember last week when we had the story about the composer who was taking stuff out? It's the same person.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:56.000
Oh, is it?

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:59.000
Yes. There's the click, click, ding.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:13.000
If I may jump in. So the whole restraining order thing they're talking about. So this is actually the whole litigation between Alex Mauer and Imago Software is actually heading to court now. There's already a court case going.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:23.000
And so the first bit, they filed a restraining order against Alex Mauer in regards to filing copyright claims.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:37.000
So she cannot file any copyright claims pertaining to the case that's in place right now because until that has been decided, who the owners are of the copyright, she can't issue takedowns anymore because she was doing it.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:48.000
And in a really vicious manner, too, because normally now if you file multiple DMCA requests against a YouTube channel at once, it'll give you just one strike.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:58.000
She was waiting enough time so that they would get individual strikes and take the channel down because she's just so vindictive against them. So on top of that.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
Was she doing it all herself? She was doing it herself.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:14.000
Well, there's also a little bit more you're saying now that they were, of course, getting more death threats from this individual and that they're not just being sent to the company, it's being sent to people associated with them as well.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:24.000
And pretty much going now through as many different channels as to threaten people to leave her music alone.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
Well, I had heard she was getting death threats, too.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:29.000
She's making death threats.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:30.000
What a mess.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:36.000
First off, death threats on the Internet need to fucking stop. No matter who it is, fucking quit.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:40.000
Right. So this is the Internet. People, when they're upset about something, do stupid shit.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:57.000
And I mean, that's from the get go, both, you know, at the some of the YouTubers have been covering like Sid Alpha and then Leonard French, the plaintiff's lawyer is basically said, listen, stop making death threats against Alex.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:03.000
You know, she is a person, you know, leave her alone, that type of stuff. So they have all basically come out and said, no, that's a bad thing.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:09.000
Right. But she's been making death threats against them. She's doxed her own lawyer after firing her lawyer.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:14.000
So she doxed her own lawyer. She doxed her parents for some reason. I'm not really sure where that comes into play.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:16.000
Where's this all come from?

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:18.000
Mental insanity?

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:22.000
No, no, no, no, no, no. Not that. Like where what where is she doing this?

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:26.000
She's doing Twitter. She's doing a bunch of places. And here's the weird stuff, though.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:32.000
The reason that we know this is because she's keeping email correspondence with these YouTubers like Sid Alpha, for example.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:40.000
She keeps sending him emails telling him what she's doing and like he keeps responding back like, listen, if I can leave me alone, stop making.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:44.000
I'm not taking your side. You've made death threats against me. You know, leave me the fuck alone.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:49.000
So, I mean, it's just it's a really weird situation that's going on.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:58.000
But the reason why she's going after the River City Ransom now is because she can't go after Starmazer or Starmazer DSP anymore because of this whole thing.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:04.000
And she's doing that against River City Ransom and she was doing it against there's another game as well that she was trying to do takedowns on.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:10.000
This is big, though, because if she if she ends up being in the wrong on this like this is this is now lost sales for this.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:16.000
They've already shown the contract that she has. She is clearly in the wrong, but it's just.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:23.000
I mean, it's just going to have to go through this whole court case and she's going to get in some pretty deep shit because of all this.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:29.000
You know, they're going to. Does she have representation, a manager? She had she had representation.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:35.000
She had a lawyer. They because they've been saying, listen, you should get a lawyer because she was going to represent herself.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:39.000
They're like, you should get a lawyer. And so they got a lawyer. And that's where they went through this whole restraint or thing.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:44.000
Apparently, she didn't like that. She fired the lawyer. And now she's on her own again.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:52.000
It's it's a goddamn mess. Hmm. But like, yeah, it's I don't I don't want to assume nothing about people.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Oh, yeah. She's taken down like about seven. She's she's going to create a nightmare for herself if she is in the wrong.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:11.000
She's already said that she's filed. She's given numbers and shown lists. She's filed 70 over 70 DMCA takedown requests against YouTubers, 50 different requests against Twitch streamers.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:17.000
And just like causing all sorts of damage and bullshit. And it's not even because like she's trying to get after them.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:24.000
It's because she was hoping that they will complain against, you know, the people that make the game to try to like kind of signal boost her shit.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:45.000
And there is another thing to do into the article that I was getting a lot of the information from that really brought up some of it to me was written by Jonathan Holmes, who apparently has violated certain aspects of journalistic integrity by by commenting and reporting on things is specifically asked not to to basically more sensationalize the story.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:54.000
I had to go in and issue a couple of retractions. That's what got me thrown off in the article, because the whole first part of it now is nothing but retractions and apologies.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:24:02.000
OK, OK. Clearly, there are many things that everybody in this situation just needs to back away from.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:09.000
So the reporters need to be back, which is ironic, but we're we're just three kids in a basement.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:19.000
She needs to back away from the DMCAs. The companies need to back away from using her music.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:26.000
I think we all just need to back away because there's no winners in the scenario. This is fucking nuts. Wow.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:32.000
Yeah. Oh, boy. All right. Well, we're I think I think it's probably best we move on.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:37.000
But that's it just kind of sucks that, you know, we were talking about this last week and now it's tied to, you know, a franchise.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:46.000
I mean, Star Mazer, an indie developed thing. That's one thing. But now we're tied to River City Ransom, a, you know, franchise that a lot of people.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:58.000
Some adult swims game or something like that, that she was because I remember she'd filed a DMC, a takedown nose against Turner broadcasting, which I'm sure I'm surprised that hasn't been in the ass yet.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:04.000
But apparently it was for some adult swim game. I just don't remember what it was. Well, let me try to let me try to network.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:09.000
Let me try to make a lemonade out of lemons in this whole thing. Maybe vodka.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:25.000
OK, it's one way to do it. Maybe all this shit will finally have that conversation on YouTube and Twitch and all these places about when is it appropriate for somebody to send a takedown request, because I think this is also the conversation we need to be having.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:38.000
And I think last time we brought this whole article up, I said, OK, well, she may be in the wrong, but who is who is pointing out that YouTube is in the wrong for issuing these strikes in the first place and letting her do it?

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:43.000
I'm using my quoting fingers, letting her do it. Where's where's YouTube's accountability?

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:50.000
And why aren't we why aren't we saying YouTube knock this shit off and stop being, you know, against your own content creators?

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
And this is something I was saying last week.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:26:02.000
They can't do anything more than that because then the system is hot. It's impossible to police that much content and they can't.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:07.000
I do think I would do it. They have to abide by these notices because they have to take them down.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:23.000
That's the whole DMC law thing. But yeah, I think it's stupid that this system has been clearly abused by a lot of people, not necessarily just for, you know, by big studios who think they own everything, but also by people that I just don't like what you're saying in that video.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:29.000
So I'm going to take it down. Right. And then then and then they purposefully know they're not going to go to the corridor on it.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:36.000
They purposely hold it for the maximum amount of time that they can and release it, because fuck you, you just don't get paid for that many weeks.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:44.000
It's stupid. All right. Let's move on. Some other news. I want to spend three hours on this. Loki.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:52.000
All right. So Steam is working or should I say Valve is working on Steam's recommendation system.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:27:02.000
So they're kind of revamping it. I remember I think this is kind of talking about how, you know, previously they talked about why things are getting recommended to you.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:14.000
So you kind of have a little bit more details. But one of the things that they're working on instead of just basically saying, you know, yes, I want to like this title or no, I don't like this title or hey, you know, add that to my wish list.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:19.000
They'll be able to choose games. They said based off of, you know, ones that they personally enjoy.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:33.000
So they're hoping that with that and expanding their curators program will kind of make things a little bit nicer looking, especially that since it's kind of getting quite crowded in there now.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:38.000
Yeah. Steam in general kind of just needs a makeover, I think.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:47.000
Well, yeah. I mean, this is all stuff that they're talking about. I think it was like several weeks ago that they kind of talked about what changes they were going to be making to the platform.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:58.000
Right. And I remember one was this whole recommendation system. Like they were going to basically say, okay, you know, okay, I have, you know, genital jousting in my, you know, hey, maybe you should check this out list.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:06.000
Why am I getting this recommended to me? And it's like, okay, you've played several games with penises in them lately. So this is why.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.000
You seem to be a fan of penis.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
We see Age of Conan in there, you know.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:21.000
Penis simulator 40, you know, 2017. So this is why you have that game.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:31.000
Oh, Lordy. All right. Uh, moving on. Let's talk about some updates that have come to Xbox live. Uh, there's a update that is a hit.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:39.000
I think that went off to all the users this week. I don't think it was just, um, or no, this, they will, they will be getting these updates soon.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:51.000
Uh, some new things coming to Xbox include a custom gamer pics. So now if you don't like your gamer pic or your OLR icon that you downloaded in 2006 or whenever that was actually on the marketplace, you can't get it anymore.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:29:00.000
Sadly. Um, but you can create your own custom gamer pic, which is pretty awesome. And what is also cool now, you can stream games with other people.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:07.000
Cause you know how mixer added this whole, and it was a big part of their recent update. Now you can do the co-op streaming with other people.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:15.000
Um, also, uh, you can actually tie a controller to your login. I guess that's kind of neat cause you can, uh, sign in a little easier and get things, uh, into it that way.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:27.000
So, uh, yeah, that is all, uh, that is all coming out soon. I guess that's probably in the beta preview program right now. Um, but I am not sure when it's actually rolling out to the, uh, Xbox one itself.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:32.000
Uh, mobile Xbox app also getting updates, which is kind of cool. So check that out.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Alright, let's go, let's go back to a simpler time in gaming though. Back, back when you didn't have, you didn't have firmware updates regularly.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:50.000
You had the system that came in the box from when you bought it at Sears. And if you didn't like it that way, tough shit. You had to wait, you had to wait for the top loader NES.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:52.000
So you didn't have to blow on cartridges anymore.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:30:05.000
It's a segment on the show we call the classic game of the week, but plot twist in 2017 Dark Sakura takes a system every month and says, Hey, you know what? One game ain't enough for you.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
Well, here's a whole damn system you should be spending some time with.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:12.000
Yeah. Dark Sakura. What is the classic system of the month?

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:27.000
The ZX Spectrum, which is an eight bit home computer that came out in the UK released by Sinclair in 1982, manufactured in Dundee, Scotland in a former Timex factory.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:45.000
At any rate, during development was called the ZX81 color and ZX82 and it came out as a ZX Spectrum because of its color display as opposed to the black and white that came out with the ZX81.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:31:00.000
It had eight different models with the entry level being 16 kilobyte ram up to 128 kilobyte rams and a floppy disk drive in 1987.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:12.000
And they sold roughly over 5 million units around the world, not counting clones of the hardware.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:18.000
It was among the first mainstream audience home computers.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:22.000
It was comparable to the Commodore 64 in the US.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:37.000
And in fact, among its competitors were the Commodore 64, the Dragon 32, the Orac One, Atmos, BBC Microcomputer and the Amstrad CPC.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:44.000
That was all over the 80s. It had over 24,000 software titles that came out.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:51.000
And in 2014 there was a Bluetooth keyboard modeled after the Spectrum keyboard that came out.

01:31:51.000 --> 01:32:09.000
And also after licensing deals and clones and the way that it boosted the UK IT industry, Clive Sinclair, I reckon the creator behind it, was awarded knighthood for services to the British industry.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:20.000
So, among the varying versions that came out, like I said, the very first one came out with 16 kilobytes of ram.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:36.000
It could be updated to 48 and the hardware was designed by Richard Altswasser of Sinclair Research and designed by Rick Dickinson.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:44.000
It was RF video and it could use any type of television or a simple color display.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:54.000
It was, I do believe, 32 by 24. Sorry, image resolution, I don't know what that was, that's text column.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:33:01.000
Image resolution was 256 by 192 with the usual 8-bit color limitations.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:05.000
But the pixel grid on it was 32 by 24.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:11.000
And of course there were several other peripherals that had for it.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:18.000
Sound was output through a beeper on the machine, as we can hear the bleep bleep sounds in the background.

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:25.000
Software could use the internal M-Play 2 channel sound.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:34.000
It had an expansion bus edge connector. It also had headphone and mic ports as well.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:41.000
And it used Sinclair Basic for most of the programming on the device.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:52.000
There were, for all of the versions that came out, we had the ZX Spectrum 16K and 48K, the Spectrum Plus, Spectrum 128.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:34:01.000
There were the Amstrad models, which was the Spectrum Plus 2, Plus 2A, Plus 3, just a number of them.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:09.000
And then of course there were a ton of clones that came out because the hardware was licensed, including a few done by Timex of Portugal.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:23.000
So it is considered, I would say, among the, I would probably say among one of the core of that 8-bit computer era.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:31.000
I'd put it right up there on the pedestal with the Commodore 64, with the Atari 800 and later computers.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
Of course, depending on your country, certainly.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:40.000
Because, you know, here in the U.S. it really didn't make that same wave, just like the MSX didn't here either, you know.

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:42.000
I honestly would like one.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
I mean, if someone wanted to just give me one, that's fine.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:56.000
But amongst the other peripherals that came out with it, there were a number of branded items that came out in a few third-party things.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:02.000
There was the ZX Printer, there was the ZX Interface, which looks like a cartridge attachment.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
Interface 2, which is another cartridge attachment.

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:09.000
The Micro Drive, which looks like it is a floppy drive of some sort.

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:11.000
And the Chemston Joystick Interface.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:18.000
A good number of different things that came out, but as far as software that came out, there were a number of...

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:28.000
I mean, not just, you know, doing database and programming and, you know, spreadsheets and even some early 3D rendering software that came out for it.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:33.000
But there were just a good number of games.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:39.000
Some of which, like in the video that I put, there was a Robocop game.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:41.000
There were a number of them.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:45.000
It also did have a cassette drive to load.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:53.000
Now, I have a love-hate relationship with computers with cassette drives, because I had a Coleco Atom as a kid.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:58.000
Power Surge Friar Tapes. Bye-bye, all magnetization.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:02.000
I didn't realize that. That's crappy.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
Yeah, no, it makes total sense, but crappy.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:13.000
I have actually some Coleco Atom tapes that I'm fairly sure are also already wiped, but they're in the package.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
Anyway, though, back to this one.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:26.000
Software was distributed, you know, you could buy items. It could also be distributed through magazines and books, where you would just type the basic program and boom, there you'd go.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
You know, kind of like in the old TI computer days.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:34.000
There were problems, of course, with copying.

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:42.000
You could copy what they called the floppy ROMs, Flexesoft and Disco Flex. I just think Disco Flex sounds cool.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
Don't copy that floppy. Disco.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:47.000
Disco Flex.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:55.000
But there were a number, of course, you know, piracy is nothing new.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:04.000
There were also a good number of developers who went through some major game developers.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:09.000
Several of whom went on to join Nintendo and Microsoft.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:19.000
So we've got some really, really good talent that's programmed for it, although I'd say that not all of the games, you know, looked as great.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
There were certainly better things that came out over time.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:24.000
But, you know, there's a lot of love for it.

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:33.000
Also, some more recent things. In 2012, on April 23rd, the Google Doodle was the 30th anniversary of the Spectrum.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:35.000
I don't need it.

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:40.000
And it was also on St. George's Day, so the logo of St. George fighting a dragon and the style of the Spectrum was the loading screen.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:55.000
And then, January 2014, Elite Systems announced that Bluetooth keyboard that looks like the Spectrum keyboard to go with the iPad and other tablet devices.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:38:06.000
And it was also announced, I'm trying to see, that there was going to be a Spectrum collection, but it was pulled.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
So, sadness on there.

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:21.000
And then there was, through Indiegogo, a 100-pound Sinclair ZX Spectrum Vega retro video game console was announced.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:26.000
But without a full keyboard and on a very limited manufacturing.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:30.000
So, there you go. The ZX Spectrum.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:36.000
All right. There it is. Your classic system of the month. The, if you want to say it the American way, the ZX Spectrum.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
If you want to say it the old kingdom way, the ZX Spectrum.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
Since it never came out over here, it only has one name.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:46.000
Ah, okay. Fair enough. All right. There it is. And some rockin' music there.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:51.000
Yeah, it sounds a lot like the Commodore 64 era stuff. Like, right, you know, same type of stuff.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:39:00.000
The thing I like is that one of my favorite channels on YouTube, Battle of the Ports, will often include Spectrum versions when comparing port versions.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:06.000
Evens done Amiga, Amstrad, Towns, a lot of those other systems that you don't hear from that much.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:12.000
All right. Well, we're going to take a break, you guys. But when we come back, there's plenty more Orange Lounge Radio.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:14.000
Orange Liquor Radio.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:22.000
There's plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come, including rapid-fire news, some more news stories, your emails, and phone calls at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:27.000
When we come back after this break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:37.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio Live tonight.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:48.000
Episode number 694 of our show already in progress for July the 16th of 2017. I can't believe this month is already halfway over. Crazy.

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:58.000
Anyway, we got some rapid-fire news to get into so we can get to release dates, your emails, some longer news, and phone calls at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
First, though, Loki with some rapid-fire news.

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:21.000
Yes. So the recently created real game of a mythical game, if you will, Polybius, is featured now in a new music video by Trent Reznor for his song Less Than.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:32.000
They actually have footage of the game that was supposed to be this arcade game reportedly that was going to cause like nausea and headaches and anyone that played here or something like that.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:39.000
But neat that it's getting featured now. That's supposed to be coming out in PlayStation VR pretty soon, so I don't know.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:47.000
Yeah, I feel like Jamie did that as a classic game of the week once. Obviously not this envisioned version, but the legend or whatever. It was a while ago.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:49.000
It's part of gaming history. Why not?

01:40:49.000 --> 01:41:01.000
It is. Why not? Why not? Was that the same song they did on Twin Peaks? Because Nine Inch Nails was in an episode of Twin Peaks recently and I don't want to spoil anything, but that was a batshit, crazy episode of Twin Peaks.

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:13.000
That's all I have to say. I don't watch a lot of TV, but that is like the one show. I'm watching that and I'm watching a little bit of Riverdale when I can. So that's like it for my TV right now. But anyway.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:15.000
Don't know.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:22.000
And then of course the game I've been looking forward to coming to PlayStation VR is coming out actually next week.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:36.000
So Superhot and Superhot VR coming to PlayStation 4 next week. And of course if you're not familiar with Superhot, Superhot is a first person shooter game where time doesn't move until you move.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:49.000
So you basically have to kind of figure your way through the scenarios and kill all the people in very elaborate ways. All while, you know, taking time to account there.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:58.000
So it's pretty cool. And the PlayStation VR version looks pretty awesome as well. You've watched the whole speedrun for during the Summer Games done quick.

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:02.000
So yeah, I am very interested. It's going to be coming out this week.

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:12.000
All right. Well, we were joking earlier this episode about game delays and how inevitable they are. And guess what? Another game got delayed this week. It's Ni No Kuni 2.

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
Oh my God. I'm sure Bobby is completely sad about this.

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:28.000
I think there was already some Twitter joke about it, but I just I overlooked it because Ni No Kuni 2, it was originally going to come out on November 10th of this year, already bumped back to January 19th, 2018.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:35.000
But what's funny about that to me is that the original Ni No Kuni was a January release. Now I want to say it was like third week of January, just like this.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:46.000
So it's kind of funny to me that this game is just following like the exact same footsteps of the first game in that regard. I just hope it has a better demo if they decide to release one.

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:51.000
Yes, Bobby says in chat, you know, the demo wasn't terrible enough, so they had to delay it.

01:42:51.000 --> 01:43:02.000
Yeah, I was like, if they would just release a good demo for this game, then maybe I could fucking stop hearing it from Bobby about this series, but I'm not going to hold my breath. They're probably just not going to do any demo at all.

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:14.000
But this game is supposed to release on PC as well, right? They did announce in that video, yeah, the little subtitle there says PlayStation 4 and PC delayed to January 19th.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:22.000
So that's kind of interesting that it's being released on both platforms at the same time, unlike the first game, which I don't think ever got released on PC.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:24.000
No, it did not.

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
I still haven't watched that Castlevania thing on Netflix.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:29.000
It was so good.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:31.000
Oh, you finally watched it.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:33.000
We watched it that night after the show last week.

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:35.000
Funny. So you liked it?

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:37.000
It was really good. I'm looking forward to there being more.

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:52.000
Well, how would you feel? Adish Shankar, I believe is how you say this name. He was the producer of the Castlevania animated series, and he was talking with Nintendo Life in an interview, and he was asked what other game series would he like to adapt?

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
Did you hear the answer to this already? You know the punchline that's coming?

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:57.000
Metroid.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:02.000
Yeah, it's Metroid. Metroid is what he says he wants to adapt next. He'd love to do a Metroid adaptation in a similar anime style as Castlevania's.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:09.000
He said Dark Metroid in the same anime style. So he didn't just say Metroid. He said Dark Metroid.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:14.000
So Metroid Prime 4 is Dark Metroid confirmed. No, I'm kidding.

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:22.000
What do you think of that though, Dark Sakura? Hearing that and having seen the original Castlevania series, do you think a Metroid thing could be done like that?

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:24.000
Totally. Totally do.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:26.000
That's a pretty high recommendation.

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:28.000
Yeah.

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:30.000
How about a Chrono Trigger adaptation?

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:31.000
No.

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:36.000
Chrono Trigger would have to be done by whatever studio Toriyama would work with.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:38.000
Fair enough.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:46.000
Or whoever is... I know the person's name and I forgot, but he's got a few people who have taken over the various Dragon Ball manga.

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
So it would be whoever his people work with.

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:55.000
Any other video games that you would like to see adapted as a Netflix series by Adi?

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:57.000
No.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
No? Whatever he wants to do. Let us know.

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:01.000
Strider.

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:05.000
Oh, there you go. Strider. I like that. Okay. Nice.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:09.000
Oh my god, you guys totally didn't pick the obvious one.

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:11.000
What?

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:13.000
The Guardian Legends.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:21.000
I want a new game before they're allowed to do a TV show. Like look, Castlevania had like at least eight games.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:23.000
What about Zelda? Let's do...

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
A Zelda anime though?

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:31.000
So we can like forget about the whole excuse me princess debacle.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
But do I want to forget about that? Maybe I don't want to forget about that.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:36.000
I want an HBO Zelda movie.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
Oh, you want that? And how? HBO Zelda, why not?

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:41.000
Because tits and ass, that's why.

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:45.000
Is it Zelda like 16? What's wrong with you?

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:47.000
Oh, come on.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:49.000
Who's gonna get naked? Impa?

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:55.000
It's like her 18. I mean that doesn't fucking matter. It's HBO. Don't introduce new characters.

01:45:56.000 --> 01:46:03.000
It's not because of the plot. It's not because of the artistic direction. No, Loki just wants tits and ass.

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
There's fairies. They'll be naked.

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:11.000
No they won't. They'll be dressed like drag queens at Zelda. Hello.

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:15.000
Haven't you seen those fairies popping out of the fountains now?

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:17.000
They're queens.

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
Which drag queen should play a Zelda fairy?

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:24.000
Judging by the looks... Bob the drag queen, done. No, no, no, no, no.

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:37.000
If it was gonna be though dead on for the ones in Breath of the Wild, we're needing the level of over the top that can only be accomplished by Miss Alyssa Edwards.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
She's gonna come out of that with a tongue pop.

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:44.000
And this is a weapon upgrade.

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:46.000
Exactly.

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
I can't pop loud enough.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:59.000
Okay. There's a portion of our fan base that just doesn't understand when the show delves into this talk.

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
And then there's another portion of our fan base that goes, yes!

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
Yes, work! Right?

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:09.000
Alright, moving on. Dark Sakura, what do you have for rapid fire dude?

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
Oh lord. Not queens.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:23.000
In news regarding BlazBlue, Jubay is coming. And it is apparently, I'm trying to see which Jubay it is.

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
Because there are many, many, many Jubay.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:32.000
My mind went straight to Fatal Fury because there was a Jubay in that game, but it's not that Jubay.

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:38.000
It's not. It is the one from Persona 4 Arena, according to what I see here.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:47.000
And also Ruby Rose from Ruby is going to be in the game too. So that's neat.

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:56.000
And then Jetta, who is like my favorite in Vampire Savior, is going to be in Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite.

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:58.000
That makes me so happy.

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
Yeah, but nothing else about Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite makes me happy.

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
Jetta and Shredder here, you make me happy.

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:14.000
No, no, seriously. I love Marvel vs. Capcom 3. I mean, that was awesome. Deadpool was in it. I mean, they had a really good cast of characters.

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
I'm going to wait for the game to come out.

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:19.000
I played the demo. Did you play the demo?

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:21.000
No, I didn't. To be fair.

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
And then Wallow in your disappointment.

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:26.000
So it's like a Ni No Kuni thing going on with the demo?

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
It's a bad demo. It's like, wow, this is crap.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:36.000
By the way, Dark Sakura, I'm going to inject this here because we're talking about new characters in fighting games.

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:43.000
This came out after the show role was done, but before the show aired. Tekken 7 is getting a new character. Did you hear this?

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:49.000
Yes, it's Geese Howard. And then Dan started walking around the house going, predictable!

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:58.000
I'm like, okay, that makes more sense now that I saw that like a thread that was announced and I was like, that must be like an in game thing, you know?

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:05.000
It's one of his like attack quotes, you know, when he does his final or when he like counters a move.

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:11.000
Why that character from Fatal Fury though? I guess so. Why fucking not? I guess he does fit into the lore.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
The intro was pretty mind blowing.

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:20.000
How can you do a Fatal Fury crossover and it not a Bogard or Joe or Mai?

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:29.000
The battle of the egos. Well, this is also listed as a second DLC. So I'd assume there would be more, but just the battle of the egos.

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:34.000
Because the whole intro was basically Geese Howard going, telling Heihachi he was an idiot.

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:36.000
That's true. It was.

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:38.000
What's wrong about that?

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:43.000
Dark Tetsuya thrown out there too in our chat. Also, I guess because Evo is obviously going on right now.

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
That's why we haven't been able to talk a lot about it because it's going on as the show is going on.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:51.000
But I guess this just happened too before the show. Dark Tetsuya says Abigail was confirmed for Street Fighter 5.

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:57.000
So, I don't, I was hoping Jamie would know what game she's from. Is she a new character?

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
I haven't played hardly any Tekken since Tekken 4.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:02.000
Street Fighter. Abigail.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:04.000
In Street Fighter 5?

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
Fuck if I remember who that is.

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:09.000
I don't think she's from the Street Fighter franchise.

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
Is she a crossover character? I seriously don't know.

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:17.000
There's just too many cooks on the Street Fighter 4.

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:22.000
My mind keeps going back to Street Fighter 4 Ultra Edition where it's like there's a hundred characters to choose from.

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:24.000
It's an episode of too many cooks.

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:28.000
Oh, Abigail was Final Fight and Abigail's actually a dude.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:30.000
Oh, really?

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
Yeah. An extremely large man with a flat top.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
Oh, is that the picture I've been seeing?

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:37.000
Oh!

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:39.000
Wearing white pants and a chain.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:41.000
Oh.

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
Yeah, now that I see the character, I just never realized that was the character's name.

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:50.000
Now that you described, oh yeah, that's right. It was a dude, a model that was Abigail.

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
I just never remembered that that was what the character was named.

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:55.000
Yeah, I just never remembered that either.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:57.000
I always just paid attention to like, Poison.

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:03.000
Well, I never knew that her name was Poison either. I was just like the leather lady with the handcuffs.

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:05.000
Poison and Roxy who were...

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:10.000
Roxy and Foxy. I didn't know all the names in those games sometimes.

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:16.000
There's a big difference between that and like Chun-Li where the name is like huge on the screen as you're choosing it and all that stuff.

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
Alright. Thank you for helping us sort that all out here.

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:21.000
Fighting games. Lots of news.

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:25.000
Let's talk about some games that are in stores this week.

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:29.000
Things that you can pick up. Maybe some other fighting games this week being released, Loki?

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:34.000
Let's see. So, I don't know about any fighting games necessarily this week,

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:39.000
but there is some stuff coming out which, you know, usually this time of year is pretty next to nothing.

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:43.000
So, with this week we've got, and I have no idea what these games are,

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:52.000
but actually Children of the Zodiarcs. That's on PC, Mac, and Playstation 4.

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
Fallen Legion on Vita and Playstation 4.

01:51:56.000 --> 01:52:00.000
Yonder, The Cloud Catcher Chronicles on PC and Playstation 4.

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:04.000
And then we've got Lone Echo on PC.

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:09.000
And then, of course, on Friday, Splatoon 2 on the Switch. That's it.

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:14.000
I'll be picking that up. Even if I only played like two rounds of Splatfest, I still want to pick up the phone.

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:21.000
And as I mentioned, of course, this week as well, you know, in our rapid fire news, Superhot and Superhot VR on Playstation 4 and Playstation VR.

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:28.000
Nice. Let's go to Japan right now. Let's get a plane. Go to Japan right now. What do you say, DarkSakura?

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:29.000
Japan.

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:34.000
Alright. Speaking of fighting games.

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:46.000
Let's see. Not a lot of releases this week on the Playstation 4, but you do have Under Night, In Birth, X, Late Street comes out this week in Japan.

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
That's on the Playstation 4. The Vita has some more stuff.

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:55.000
Rabbit Cross Labyrinth, Puzzle Out Stories, Farming Simulator 18. I know you're all hype about that.

01:52:56.000 --> 01:53:02.000
And Dragon Ball Z, Battle of Z gets a price reduction. It goes into the Welcome Price edition from Bandai Namco.

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:04.000
So there is that.

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:06.000
I welcome that price.

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
I always welcome a good sale. The Switch gets some releases in Japan this week.

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:14.000
Cars 3 gets its release on the Switch, but also Fate Xtella.

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:20.000
That is also in a multi-language edition, so theoretically you could import that if you want.

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:29.000
Something you can't import unless you have a Japanese 3DS are some of these releases, including Yokai Watch 3, Tempura, and Sushi also getting price reductions.

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:31.000
Those games have been out, but they're getting a price reduction this week.

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:39.000
That's only going to cost you $24 to import them, so I think those are down to probably $18 right now, so that's a pretty good deal.

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:43.000
Farming Simulator 18 also getting its release on 3DS this week, however.

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:45.000
What about the UK, DarkSakura?

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:54.000
In the UK, we have a few things. On the 18th, we have Strike Vector EX and Yonder, the Cloud Catcher Chronicles.

01:53:55.000 --> 01:54:00.000
Those are only on PlayStation 4 and PC. Strike Vector EX is PC only.

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:05.000
On the 19th, we have What Remains of Edith Finch for Xbox One.

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:10.000
And on the 20th, Fate Xtelle, the Umbral Star for Switch.

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:12.000
That is it.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:17.000
Alright, let's go to the mailbag. Every week you guys send us emails.

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:21.000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send us emails.

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:28.000
And we dive into the mailbag and pull out our favorite emails to read here on the show.

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:35.000
When I say favorite, we really do. We read them all. Unless it's like spam or it says don't read this on air at the top.

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
Then we read it extra loudly, twice.

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:40.000
Here in studio amongst ourselves.

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:41.000
Yes, and they laugh.

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:46.000
Alright, let's get to it. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com. What's in the mailbag, DarkSakura?

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:48.000
Hello, LR.

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:53.000
Hi, YYR. I just have a few short responses to last week's episode.

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:57.000
Rob, your desire to voice a character in a game someday has been heard.

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:01.000
I have nothing further to announce at this time, but please stay tuned. Insert evil after here.

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:03.000
Yay!

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:05.000
And no, Rob, you're not getting too old for conventions.

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:09.000
If you start to feel that you are, though, just do what I do and act approximately half your age.

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
I do that on a daily, so...

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:14.000
You do that when you do dailies.

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:16.000
That's right.

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:18.000
That's it. Have a great week. Keep on smiling, Aaron, YYR.

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:20.000
Wow, that really was a short email from YYR.

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:28.000
But YYR, like, makes dreams come true. I think YYR should be, like, he's the genie. He's the official genie of OLR.

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:30.000
He makes our wishes come true.

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000
Oh my lord, Ranma. What's with this long email?

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000
He made a game out of poop for you, Dark Sakura.

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:37.000
Yes, he did.

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
Tell us that's not the OLR genie right there.

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:42.000
That was my dream game.

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:46.000
Hey, now, we've got the new genie, of course. That's gonna be Will Smith.

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000
That's right. I heard that. The movie...

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:54.000
Here's the only thing I don't like. I don't really give a crap about the casting and all that stuff, although, you know, that's great.

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:58.000
I want that new trailer! I want that new Marvel trailer, dammit! Next week, I guess.

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:05.000
What? Every single movie from the 90s that Disney did, and animation, they're going back and doing live.

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:07.000
We've run out of ideas!

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:13.000
Except The Little Mermaid. The Little Mermaid is the one movie they haven't done, committed to yet.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:21.000
But Aladdin, Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, like, they're doing them all, like, they're doing them all live now.

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:26.000
Because Beauty and the Beast made them money, and they're like, cha-ching, we're done.

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:32.000
And Bobby Blackwolf in chat, pointing out, you voiced Flappy Vog with a sad face.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:37.000
But I didn't play a character in that game, I was myself.

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:42.000
And I recorded my lines in the rain in my car, far away from my office building, so no one could hear me making those voices.

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:51.000
And then on top of that, I was gonna say that the, what was it, what was the other Disney trailer that they had?

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
The Oprah Winfrey one. Nothing else matters.

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
That looked fucking awesome, and I love that song in the trailer.

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000
Oh, the Sweet Dreams cover, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
What was that, A Wrinkle in Time? Was that the movie?

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:07.000
Yeah, that looks awesome. I remember that book being creepy, and the trailer was creepy, so I'm gonna assume it's creepy.

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
If you didn't see that trailer for Wrinkle in Time, and I never get out to movies either.

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:14.000
I hardly watch any TV, I hardly ever see movies, I wanna go see that Wrinkle in Time.

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:20.000
But the only, I wanna point out, sorry, I know you got an email to get to, the only movie that fucking matters next year.

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:25.000
Mark a calendar, circle it. Mamma Mia 2. In July.

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
Yeah, it's really happened. They cast Young Meryl Streep and everything.

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:30.000
Is there a sequel to the play?

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:32.000
No. How about I read the next email?

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:34.000
Who cares? Abba. End.

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:39.000
Evening Rob, Jamie, and Loki. First of all, let me say Happy 15th. By the way, this is from Rama.

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:45.000
This email I have been meaning to send to y'all a couple weeks ago, but life came first. Don't you just hate that?

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:50.000
But anywho, there's a few things I do want to say. This email is kinda long, meaningful, but long.

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:52.000
Thanks, Rama.

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:59.000
Hearts. First of all, if it wasn't for OLR, there would not be an anime jam session. Truthfully, I hate writing.

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:04.000
I feel that writing, I am not able to get my thoughts down well. It's either too long or too short.

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:10.000
Podcasting allows me to get my thoughts out verbally, and I feel like it works out so well, uh, so well better.

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:12.000
Okay. Podcasting-

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:19.000
Clearly not a good writer. I'm sorry. I couldn't resist. No, no, no. And you know what? I'm joking because I'm right there with you, Rama.

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:26.000
I feel this exact same way. I do not like reading what I write, yet in a corporate environment, I'm okay.

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:28.000
I like writing much better than talking.

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:30.000
But even then, I always feel like I'm a better talker.

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:35.000
That's why my blog hasn't been put up yet. It's GoDaddy's fault. Anyway.

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:41.000
Podcasting has given, he said, men an extended life.

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:46.000
On going to conventions. As much as I love cosplaying, I've kind of burned out on it.

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:59.000
I worked as a vendor, and it wasn't for me. Now going to cons, cosplaying for a few, but then wearing my Vogue Network t-shirt, taking pictures, watching cosplayers smile when I take their pictures, and coming in on Tuesday nights to talk about my experiences.

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:05.000
Secondly, if it wasn't for y'all and Travis, I would not be able to teach others I know on podcasting.

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:15.000
I tell people that you don't need expensive, top of the line equipment. It surprises some people when I show off my equipment that it does not say Razor or some other fancy name.

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:22.000
To be fair, I do have a pair of Astro A40s I use, but I've been using, when I have been using for the past three to four years.

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:31.000
I've told people that this podcast is a labor of love. Everyone that works with me gives up some of their free time to help do the show, write articles and other great things for us.

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:38.000
I don't even know how much I've spent on doing this podcast. If I could take a guess, it would have to be over five grand.

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:47.000
I do not regret a single penny of it, because this is a labor of love. I really don't look at my numbers to see how popular the show is unless I need it for a press application.

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:57.000
And Rob, bless and testify. It makes my blood boil when I see other independent podcasts slash media outlets going to Kickstarter, Indiegogo, Patreon to raise funds.

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:05.000
You don't need a lot of money to have the best hardware or software, because truthfully, one could have that and it could still come up short.

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:16.000
Also, my staff has full-time jobs, so if make tiers to cover these conventions, there's no promise that my staffers can get that time off.

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:29.000
I have enough funds to cover said Con, let alone interview people at that convention. My Google FU is weak, so I can't look up that show you were talking about, but I agree with your thoughts on it.

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
Ask me off air. I'm not starting a fight on air.

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:39.000
There's another podcasting site that does something similar every year on Kickstarter, I'm not going to say it either, for BlizzCon and it burns me.

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:45.000
If my fans want to send me to a Con, great, but I will never ask them for a handout to do it. I will, just saying.

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:49.000
Okay, can I address a couple things here real quick? Sorry, it gives you a break in the email.

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:57.000
The Blizzard thing that he linked, I actually looked at, and it is actually, there's a difference here, and this is why I wanted to call it out.

02:00:57.000 --> 02:01:02.000
At least the particular thing that he linked in the email was actually a Kickstarter I've donated to a couple years ago.

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:12.000
Because this Kickstarter was not about send XYZ person to said expo, but it was about let's do a pre-party, basically, for the expo.

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:23.000
I recognize that shit does cost money to do, they have to rent the ballroom and all this stuff, and so I think when it comes to those types of Kickstarters and stuff, that's fine.

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:32.000
And even at the end of the day, you know what, I understand that some people want to have a goal be to like, I want to get to, we'll say PAX.

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:39.000
I want to go to PAX, Penny Arcade Expo, and so, you know, if my listeners will help me collect the money, then I can actually go.

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:43.000
And at the end of the day, whatever you want to spend your money on is your business.

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:51.000
And I kind of feel that same way with the Patreon and stuff. I'm not, if podcasters want to go on Patreon, cool.

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:59.000
That's a choice for you, the podcaster, and your audience, ultimately, what they want to spend their money on. Cool. Like, that's fine.

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:09.000
Where my feathers got ruffled with that Kickstarter was because they set a number that, in my humble opinion from all the years of doing this, was way too fucking high.

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:15.000
And the way it kind of came off was that without this money, we can't do a podcast.

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:22.000
And that is specifically what ticked me off about that whole thing. Because I'm like, you can do a podcast for nothing.

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:32.000
You want this money because you want nice studio equipment. You want the nice to haves, not the need to haves.

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:43.000
That was the difference. But if somebody wants to do a Patreon, a Kickstarter, a Twitch tip bucket for the nice to haves, well, who am I to complain?

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:50.000
But here's the thing with the Patreon again. And I, even with Twitch, I'm starting to feel it a little bit.

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:57.000
Like, you know, my Twitch channel recently opened up so that people can subscribe. And I think I have four or five subscribers right now, which is awesome.

02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:00.000
The fact that even one person wanted to subscribe is fucking awesome.

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:11.000
But I haven't been able to do much streaming in the past two weeks because of, you guys know I'm going through some real serious personal stuff right now with my mom and my family and stuff.

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:16.000
And it's not getting better. And that's all I'm going to say on it right now.

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:25.000
But I almost feel, like, guilty that I'm not streaming more because I'm thinking in my mind, like, fuck, I have subscribers.

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:33.000
Like, they're paying money and using their Twitch Prime to do it. And I know at the end of the day, these people, I know they're not, like, they totally understand.

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:38.000
I know reasonably everybody knows why I haven't been doing as much of that stuff recently.

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:50.000
It's just this weird, like, I can't explain it, you guys, it's just this weird mental block I have that it's like, when you are giving me money, I feel a bit of liability to produce content for said money.

02:03:51.000 --> 02:04:06.000
Does that make sense? And that's what's held me back personally from the Patreon thing for a long time, is that if we were to start to take money for doing OLR, but then let's say some life circumstance happens and we have to end OLR in two weeks.

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:15.000
I don't know about you guys, but I would feel real guilty about taking that money. Because then OLR would be over. Does that make sense? Where my head is at with that?

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:26.000
Anyway, that's my whole thing. But if somebody wants to raise the money to go on a trip, I don't know if I want to put myself out there like that, but if somebody else wants to do it, and you want to give them money?

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:31.000
Alright, y'all know what you're buying, y'all know what you're funding? Cool. That's on y'all.

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:35.000
Anyway, I just wanted to clarify that. Jamie, sorry. Thank you for letting me.

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:39.000
Well, I was halfway through the paragraph and he did comment on what you already commented on.

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:41.000
Oh, my bad.

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:46.000
I know that these people are more than just BlizzCon. They host a party and much, much more.

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:55.000
Oh, come on. We all know where half that money goes. Hell, I see cosplayers doing this too, just to get new costumes or to do exotic shoots, etc.

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:59.000
I don't like it, but if they want to do this, these people want to give them money. Let them.

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:07.000
I'm going to be over here doing it my way. It's one thing where fans give you a few dollars to support you. It's another thing when you beg for it.

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000
And, yeah, this one's to me.

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:14.000
And yes, Jamie, I do agree that it's hard when one of us aren't around for Tuesday night.

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:20.000
Ari has mentioned for how much of our show is a part of him and us not being here throws him off.

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:34.000
For me, it's ingrained in my Tuesday night routine. After work, I get Buffalo Wild Wings, do a little shopping at Target slash Stop and Shop, go home, watch NCIS or SmackDown Live for an hour, hop on Skype, quick prep and go.

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:43.000
Thank you for playing our little anniversary clip. I would have put it in Dropbox, but I didn't think Rob would check it before the show. My bad.

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:48.000
I've said it once. I've said it again. OLR is more than a podcast. We're a family.

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:57.000
There has been many times that you, Rob, have brought important topics to the table that we should be in the know about. And that's an amazing thing.

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:04.000
You have been there for me a couple of times when I needed it. And Jamie can tell you that she's been there for me a few times.

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:10.000
And on that same token, I am there for y'all. I will defend Rob, Jamie and Matt until my last breath because y'all's family.

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:20.000
Oh, and like I said before, I love doing this. I love investing all the time, money, effort, hard work into it, just so that other people see and enjoy the fruits of our labor.

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:28.000
And when I wake up one day and say it's time to wrap it up, so be it. I've had fun doing this for eight or so years. I think I've got another eight in me.

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:36.000
I think that's all I have to say about that. Love always. I don't know if you want us to use your first name, so I'll just say Ronma.

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:41.000
That was a really great email. Thank you. And that's really all I can say succinctly.

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:43.000
I have a lot of feelings about this.

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:55.000
Emails like that are worth way more than a few biddies. Not that I'm going to complain about the biddies. Don't get me wrong. I'm just saying emails like that. That's all the kickstart I need.

02:06:56.000 --> 02:07:00.000
But I'm still waiting for a taco. I just want a taco.

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:11.000
Alright, last email. This comes from MXC. Hi MXC in chat. Do you folks have any thoughts about that upcoming Dream Daddy dad dating simulator game?

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000
It looks funny. I hear it got delayed though, I think.

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:24.000
For me personally, it really bugs me how the marketing of the game attempts to sell the concept as utterly wacky a la Hataful Boyfriend and the idea of dating pigeons.

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:34.000
Then there's the Game Grumps Association, which also worries me, given they aren't necessarily known for being great LGBT advocates historically.

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:49.000
With that said, the developers have stated Dream Daddy is actually a serious story of a single father looking for love, which could be a great story for an individual novel to tell if treated with all respect.

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:55.000
Just curious what you think about it. We'll see if Dream Daddy is any good when it launches next week, regards to MXC.

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:57.000
Oh, I guess it didn't get delayed. I thought it already got delayed.

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:01.000
It was supposed to come out earlier this week and then they bumped it to Wednesday.

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000
Oh, well that's not much of a delay, but no.

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:12.000
It's really hard for me to tell. I've certainly heard a lot about it. There's a lot of talk on Twitter about it and certainly the Game Grumps Association.

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:24.000
I must admit, I've actually never seen, but I know it's very popular with the kids, so I know that association is getting more increased visibility and so forth.

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:40.000
Certainly, I have some slight reservations because I don't want it to be a joke. I'm pushing 40 years old. I may not have kids, but I got a kitty, so I might be one of the Dream Daddies in this scenario and my life isn't a fucking joke.

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:50.000
But that being said, my understanding is that they have LGBT folks actually working on the game, that they are getting the consultation with that and all that.

02:08:51.000 --> 02:09:00.000
I'm keeping an open mind that it can be done respectfully and if that's the case, then cool. That actually might end up being really fucking awesome.

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:13.000
That a group that's very popular with the YouTube generation and all this stuff kind of uses that power for representation and as we said at the beginning of the show, representation matters.

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:21.000
But just not when it's a joke. So as long as the game isn't a joke, which I'm not getting that vibe from a lot of the things I'm seeing from it.

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:28.000
So we'll see. I'll wait until the game's out and then I'll let y'all know how I felt.

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:35.000
Well, we did also have one more email that I had missed the first time around, so if we've got time for me to read it.

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:37.000
Of course.

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:41.000
Hey, OLR. Hope all is well. I wanted to talk about the EVO reveals for a bit.

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:48.000
Summary Showdown 5 Special for PS4 Vita. Sick! This seems to be the uncut version and hopefully the port is good.

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:58.000
I haven't seen any EVO footage of it yet, but I'll definitely get it as it's one of the very few fighting games I'm actually competent in and I am stuck with the damn boot. Hold on.

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:05.000
Dar Sakura's having to rearrange her positioning a little bit because her boot got stuck between the table and the chair.

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:12.000
Well, I have the table moved forward so that I can prop up the boot on it. It's just hard to move the thing around.

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:13.000
That's alright.

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:29.000
BlazBlue Cross Tag Battle. Um, yes, Lord, count me in. Not often that you get BlazBlue Ruby Persona 4 and especially Under Night In-Birth EXE late characters into one game for Slugfest. I'm pumped.

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:35.000
I haven't played anime fighters in quite some time, but shit, take my money and let's rock.

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000
Geese Howard in Tekken 7. Predictable!

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:53.000
I expected Wei Wulong, but Geese is a great addition. Bandai Namco did say they were going to add more guest characters and they made a good impression so far. Can't imagine who the next character will be.

02:10:54.000 --> 02:11:06.000
EX Fighting Lair. Well, it's definitely not a hoax. Slated to come out next year with a beta at the end of 2017. Wasn't too big into the Street Fighter EX series, but this looks pretty good. At least Skullomania is in it. I love Skullomania.

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
So they're remaking the 3D fighting game?

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:10.000
I reckon.

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:12.000
Cool.

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:27.000
But I also liked playing, um, Hokuto. MVC Infinite. It was good to see Jetta in action, but I feel more needs to be shown from the game. It's out in two months and we haven't received any official demonstration about the last two Infinity Gems, Mind and Soul.

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:41.000
I don't know that your Mind Gem Infinity Surge creates a copy of your character that mimics your attacks. The Soul Gem Infinity Surge revives your knocked out character. That makes sense since your knocked out character doesn't fade away.

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:55.000
Dragon Ball FighterZ. Future Trunks? Fuck yes! Just sign me up. More info for beta is coming on July 26th. Okay, you know what I want for this? If they put in Future Trunks, I want him to have his music from the other games.

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:59.000
It has to be there, because that would make me super happy.

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:13.000
I feel that 2018 will be a great year for fighters. The lineup is pretty diverse and there's something for everyone. What are your thoughts? Also, DarkSakura, I'd like to play you some time in some fighters. Feel free to add me on PSN, Steam or Xbox Live.

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:26.000
I will probably add you, but I'm going to let you know right now, I cannot play like I used to play. Not since having three surgeries on my right hand. So fair warning, you'll probably kick my butt.

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:39.000
But I would love to play some time. I'll just have to get back into practice. Although usually, because I just don't bother signing Dan out anymore, I'm usually logged in on PS4 under Dan's name.

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:43.000
Rob, I hope your mom gets better. She's in my thoughts and prayers.

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:49.000
Loki, I love your rants by the way. If I'm ever in NorCal, I'll buy you three a beer.

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:54.000
Thanks for taking the time to read my email and have a great week. Needle crash. Thank you, needle crash.

02:12:55.000 --> 02:13:06.000
To respond to the question about the fighting, you know, how 2018 looks for fighters. I must admit, I feel like somewhere along the way I kind of slipped out of playing as many fighting games as I used to.

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:13.000
I'm still hoping for that Smash Brothers on Switch. That's the thing I really want more than anything right now.

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:22.000
But I do want to check out Tekken 7. And the Geese Howard thing even kind of made me perk up and go, oh yeah, I never did get Tekken 7 when it first came out.

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:30.000
I've got to keep my eye on that. So I might pick that up at some point, especially if I catch it on another sale. I think it was just on sale on PlayStation and I missed it.

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:39.000
But I do want to check out Tekken 7 at some point. So yeah, I just, I don't know. I don't do as well with the 3D stuff, but I know there's some good 2D fighters out there still too.

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:46.000
You know, especially what, BlazBlue is still 2D and all that stuff, right? So I just need to play more.

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:54.000
I'm probably still looking forward to Dragon Ball FighterZ. That's going to be the big one.

02:13:54.000 --> 02:14:01.000
I just look at, every time I watch the videos of people playing it, I'm like, what? Give.

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:11.000
I'm going to crack and get Street Fighter V at some point. It's just a matter of time. It's kind of surprising I've gone this long without buying it, but I just haven't.

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
So at some point I'm going to finally get Street Fighter V.

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:16.000
When the Game of the Year edition comes out.

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:20.000
Exactly. With the final edition with all the crap. That's kind of what I'm waiting for.

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:28.000
Anyway, thank you guys for the emails. Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send your emails if you want to have an email read in the future.

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:32.000
In the meantime, we have a few more stories for you guys before we get to calls at Orange Lounge Radio. Loki.

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:39.000
Hey, more talk about VR. Actually, this is a little bit talk about Unity as well because Unity just rolled out.

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:48.000
They showed off, I want to say it was during one of their Unite conferences, but they had a, it's now Unity 2017.

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:57.000
So they dropped the whole 4.5 moniker for that and now they have this whole 2017 thing which includes a lot of cool stuff.

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:07.000
Their new cinematic content, timeline features, as well as adding support for Nvidia VR works to render VR more efficiently.

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:21.000
So what does that do exactly? So they have, for example, support for multi res shading, which is a technique that renders basically the main parts of your display.

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:30.000
So everything that you're kind of looking at in a higher resolution than say the outside edges where the distortion would kind of make it look a little bit messed up anyway.

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:38.000
So they render that less with a less resolution so that it's not as noticeable, I guess, a little bit faster.

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:50.000
They said lens matching shading, also single pass stereo or in the new simultaneous multi projection architecture and VR SLI.

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:55.000
So performance when there's multiple GPUs or better performance.

02:15:55.000 --> 02:16:02.000
Neat. A lot of stuff I probably won't end up using unless I someday decide to develop a VR game.

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:06.000
But yeah, I download it, of course.

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:12.000
It kind of still ties into the whole fact that VR is just growing and growing as it gets more accessible to make for in Unity.

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:19.000
Well, they sell most of the, like I would say like a vast majority of the content out there is made with Unity for VR.

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:23.000
So it's, I don't know, it's definitely out there.

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:32.000
All right. Well, there's a fan made project out there that I can't believe hasn't already been cease and desisted by the time we're doing this show, but it hasn't.

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:35.000
It's out there. So you want to go grab a load it now. Yeah, exactly.

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:43.000
Anyhow, this is a, I guess you could say it's been inspired a little bit by Mario maker, but this is a game featuring mega man.

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:48.000
That's right. It's mega maker. Actually, I don't think the game is out. It's just a trailer that's out right now.

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:50.000
And that's how you not do it. Exactly.

02:16:50.000 --> 02:17:01.000
Mega maker is using assets for mega man, one through six, I guess over a hundred different tile sets, uh, 12 robot masters, original chiptune inspired soundtracks, uh, made by cosmic gem.

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:09.000
That's pretty cool. The game itself will be free. Uh, and I guess they're trying to do that. So actually it is available for download.

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:16.000
If they charge for it, they're going to, uh, they're going to get screwed on that. So, uh, this has been development since September of 2016.

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:25.000
Um, so there you go. You say, Oh yeah. Cause it was set to launch on July 15th, which uh, yeah, mega dash maker.com and you can check it out.

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:35.000
And I would grab that now before, I mean, granted cap calm isn't Nintendo, but I don't know y'all when, when somebody does mega man universe,

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:41.000
the way we all thought mega man universe was going to happen when somebody just kind of like did that. I don't know.

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:50.000
It may not last very long through the lawyers, so be careful or who knows, maybe, maybe, um, that one gal that's doing all the cease and desisting will cease and desist this too.

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:56.000
Cause somehow she'll think that she owns somebody did a chip tune to one of her songs in the game and then that then it'll all be over.

02:17:57.000 --> 02:18:04.000
So just, uh, I go grab that as soon as you can. No, I see. I was trying to read a little bit more about this here. Um, it doesn't really show a whole ton.

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:12.000
However, I did see that there's a part here, like other things you can download that come with it, a warp world, which is for Twitch integration.

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:18.000
So I'm wondering if that's some sort of like where they have a Twitch chat integration or something.

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:25.000
Oh, maybe. Cause that's a big thing on Mario maker is that people will like play my level and here's my code. And then, you know, they go play the levels.

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:34.000
So, which by the way, I'm going to be doing on tonight's, uh, OLR poster. I haven't done the poster myself in like a month, so I'm doing it tonight.

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:43.000
Uh, and I'm going to play Mario maker. So, and I am willing to play some of y'all's levels. So get the codes. However, I am not interested in hell levels.

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:52.000
You don't want to play a castle of carnage. If the whole point of your level is me dying 500 times, just don't bother.

02:18:52.000 --> 02:19:00.000
It's not impossible when you compare it to like some of the other levels. I did pass it a few times. Um, but yeah, that's very hard.

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:10.000
All right. So anyhow, but I'm willing to play your standard difficulty or lower Mario Kart or Mario Kart, Mario maker levels, but we'll get into that after the show.

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:16.000
In the meantime, we have some more news to get to, uh, including a little, a little callback, right? Dark Sakura.

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:19.000
I guess.

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:23.000
Yes. A callback. Yeah. Something cause you already brought this up earlier in the show. Sorta.

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:29.000
Yes I did. Yeah, absolutely. Oh, is it my turn? Yeah. Sorry. I was yelling at someone on the internet.

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.000
Sometimes it has to be done.

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:45.000
Well, I was bringing up the ZX spectrum earlier. Now, another thing that people may or may not know about me, I'm a fucking big Radiohead fan and Radiohead did something really, really cool.

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:54.000
Um, with their re-release of Okay Computer, which was a great album by the way, and this re-release costs, um, a hundred pounds.

02:19:55.000 --> 02:20:11.000
Um, they have, uh, an art book, a collection of notes that were penned by Tom York, who is a very interesting individual to read his blog, um, a limited edition vinyl of the album and a C90 cassette.

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:19.000
Now, the C90 cassette has a bunch of Radiohead demos, but the last two minutes of it is computer screeching.

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:27.000
You know, when they tell you, this is a PlayStation black disc. Do not play the first track. Thank you, Alucard.

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:39.000
Anyway, um, people ran it through a ZX Spectrum emulator and found out that it's messages from, uh, the, uh, from the band.

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:45.000
Congratulations, you found the secret message of Sidli-, is it Sid Lives or Sid Lives? Uh, hmm.

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:58.000
And, um, then it says we should get out more. So there you go. It is a, uh, a little Easter egg for those who were fans of the ZX Spectrum.

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:10.000
I love that. I would love to do, I, you know, don't be surprised if in the future at the end of an OLR episode, there's some screeching and it'll end up being a Commodore 64 tape.

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:13.000
And just be me complaining.

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:23.000
Yes, it'll be, it'll be a typed Loki rant, or I'll just insert, you know, I ain't never had a sugar daddy, but if I wanted a sugar daddy, I could get one because I am what, bitch? Sickening.

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:27.000
I think I'll just put that at the end of one of the episodes in a Commodore 64 format.

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:29.000
I would just be incoherently screaming.

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:35.000
But that's, you don't have to put the tape in a Commodore 64 to hear that, Darcira.

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000
Alright. What, what's on my fan?

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:42.000
Uh, two owls.

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:44.000
Owls will kill a bitch.

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:46.000
No, hearts, love, love forever.

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:51.000
I know. What's on my, my fan? I have a big middle finger with a political statement underneath it.

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:53.000
Mine's cute because it has owls on it.

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:55.000
Alright. Uh, moving on. Loki, what do you have?

02:21:56.000 --> 02:22:02.000
So of course, um, Pokemon Go is going to be having its first event pretty soon actually in Chicago.

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:04.000
Saturday. Yep. Yep.

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:08.000
Um, so with that, of course, not everybody can make it to Chicago to play Pokemon Go.

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:12.000
So they have stuff going on, um, in case you're not nearby.

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:24.000
So if, um, you are in Chicago, of course, you'll be able to that day, I guess they're going to have different time challenges and you'll have to collect certain types of Pokemon.

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:30.000
And apparently if they catch enough during those windows, they can unlock perks for players globally.

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:41.000
And during those periods, players who aren't in the area can extend the length of those unlocked bonuses by catching their own Pokemon during those times.

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:52.000
And I guess if you catch enough, um, monsters worldwide, another secret challenge will be unveiled in Chicago, which could unlock an extra special bonus across the globe.

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:55.000
It's going to be another fucking hat. I know it. Fucking Pikachu hat.

02:22:55.000 --> 02:23:04.000
I think it's going to be a legendary monster will show up at gyms around the world. That's what I think it'll be.

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:14.000
There was a, there was a leak of something from the iTunes India store or something that was an ad that said, now featuring raids and first legendary Pokemon.

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:18.000
So let the legendaries are fucking happening on Saturday. It's just a matter of how they roll out.

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:20.000
And they'll be in all the gyms.

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:22.000
Yeah, that's, that's what they'll do.

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:31.000
Yeah. You know, I don't know if it'll necessarily be like Artuno and the, and the three, it might be Mewtwo though. I think Mewtwo is a good candidate for who's going to get unleashed, but we'll see.

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:41.000
I mean, who knows anything can happen, but all I have to say, if you are lucky enough to be going to the Chicago event, if you're going to Grant Park on Saturday, you need to fucking unlock the Stardust bonus.

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:45.000
That should be your number one priority. That's the one fucking thing we don't get enough of in the game.

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:50.000
Stardust, Stardust, Stardust. You better be fucking getting us the Stardust bonus. That's all I have to say.

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:52.000
So what bonuses are they supposed to have?

02:23:53.000 --> 02:24:00.000
Uh, there's a little mini poster out there somewhere and I don't have it in front of me, but one, like, it's like if they catch grass Pokemon, it's a Stardust bonus.

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:08.000
Another one is like walking, like reduces the distance for walking. Another one is like, I don't know, there's just a bunch of stuff.

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:13.000
Pretty much all of them have been in a holiday event previously, except the Stardust thing.

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:19.000
That's why I'm like, you need to get the fucking Stardust because that you cannot have enough Stardust ever.

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:24.000
So yeah, and it's, it's harder to even get it now. I mean, you can kind of get.

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:28.000
Okay, so if you do fire types, it's a candy bonus.

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:31.000
Not you, Chicago. Chicago has to do this.

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:39.000
Fire types is a candy bonus. Water types is an XP bonus. Grass type is a Stardust bonus.

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000
Get all the grass. Get all the grass. It's a part.

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:54.000
Electric is egg distance bonus. Rock is buddy distance bonus. And whatever the hell that is, I guess that's normal, is encounter rate bonus.

02:24:55.000 --> 02:25:02.000
And then they're saying that rewards, bronze is increased bonus duration by 24 hours. Silver, 48 hours. And gold mystery challenge unlocked.

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:11.000
And I'm going to go out on Saturday and play just to kind of contribute to this. And, you know, it's a good, good excuse to go out for a walk.

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:17.000
So there you go. Help contribute. Yeah. Yeah.

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:22.000
So 200 Matt says I'm tired of saving two months worth of Stardust and spending it on leveling up a Pokemon twice. Exactly.

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:26.000
We need a Stardust bonus. Bad. So make that happen.

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:33.000
All right. One more story for you guys. Then we're going to open up the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:43.000
And it has to do with, okay, so have y'all been to the gas station? Like, I don't know. It's not, I don't think it's a particular, like, I don't know if it's like Chevron or something or whatever.

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:49.000
But you go in the gas station and let's say you buy something at the store and when they ring you up, it makes the sonic ring noise.

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:51.000
Yes, I've noticed that.

02:25:51.000 --> 02:26:02.000
Because like the, I love that. Like whenever I'm in the gas station, I hear that. And apparently the reason why that happens, I never knew this, but apparently the reason why that happens, this has to do with Sega's ties to pachinko.

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:11.000
And so through the pachinko mechanisms, this got licensed to some of those systems. Okay. Now there's a new one that's hitting gas stations.

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:19.000
It's not the sonic noise, but what it is, it's the song of time from Zelda.

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:20.000
What?

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:32.000
Yeah, I know, right? It's not at their cash register. It's apparently at a car wash. Somebody posted this to Reddit and check this out. I'll play the video here. It's not the best quality, but if we listen carefully, you can hear it.

02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:42.000
Oh, it's not even playing. That's why. If the video will play on my end, we can hear it.

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:48.000
Except this is gonna hang up on me live on air. Let me try this one more time. I'm gonna reload the page.

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:49.000
Reload!

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:58.000
And try to play that for you. But yeah, you can actually, and this video is floating around the internet. It's over on Reddit. It's actually somebody pulled up at a car wash, and the car wash is actually playing the song of time.

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:06.000
Let's see if I can get it to go one more time here. And maybe they took down the video? I don't know. But yeah, it's not playing for me now.

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:07.000
It's probably your computer.

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:15.000
Yeah, it's probably this old, old computer I used to broadcast the show. Well, you'll just have to believe me. It's playing from the little car wash thing.

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:24.000
It's funny, but I don't think Nintendo would ever license their stuff like that, so it's so weird that something like that showed up in one of those car wash things.

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:32.000
SSJ100map points out a song of storms would have made sense, but I'll take it. When you go in that car wash...

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:35.000
Oh, there it goes. I was gonna say, to be fair, it's not playing on mine either.

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:44.000
It finally started. Well, all it is is somebody playing. They're holding up their cell phone as they're at the car wash. It's not the best quality.

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:53.000
But somebody posted a link in our chat. I just thought it was funny. I thought it was funny. It's on Reddit, in the Zelda Reddit, if you want to see it for yourself.

02:27:54.000 --> 02:28:01.000
Anyway, fine. I just want an excuse to talk about the sonic ring noise at gas stations, because, come on, video games IRL.

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:06.000
Skype line is open. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype if you want to give us a call.

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:12.000
And talk about whatever you'd like. Something you saw that's been going on in gaming news this week, or something else that tickles your fancy.

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:16.000
In the meantime, I'm gonna check in with Loki to see if there's any last minute stories.

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:18.000
I don't know, but I...

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:23.000
I thought there was one thing I didn't put on show roll that I thought you might cover. The Star Wars AR. I guess you addressed that so much.

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:24.000
Oh, yeah, yeah. I guess I'll talk about that.

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:34.000
So, yeah, one of the weird things that they showed during D23 is that Lenovo and Disney are making an AR headset.

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:40.000
Which is like, what the hell? So they're making almost like a hololens in one of the games...

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:43.000
So Disney Infinity didn't work out, so let's put out another peripheral.

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:44.000
So let's put out, yeah, this.

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:48.000
And so what, of course, the first thing that they're gonna use with it is Star Wars.

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:55.000
And so they actually, it comes with like a light saber with like a, imagine like a stubby, you know, beam on it.

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:58.000
And I guess in the game it adds all the extra stuff in there.

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:08.000
And it's supposed to be, from what I gathered, the training thing that Luke did with the blast shield and how he's fighting the little drone robot thing.

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:09.000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:11.000
So it's supposed to be like training that and stuff.

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:18.000
I'm just always, you know, don't get me wrong, like, AR sounds cool and I hope this is cheap and I hope it's good.

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:25.000
But after Kinect Star Wars, I'm always wary when it comes to motion Star Wars games.

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:27.000
I'm like, ah, I don't know.

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:29.000
After Star Wars Kinect?

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:33.000
After Star Wars Kinect, I'm like, ah, man, you were willing to put your name on that.

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:35.000
Chewbacca dancing on him.

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:40.000
To be fair, I think that was before LucasArts was purchased by Disney, so hopefully...

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:42.000
That was before LucasArts was purchased.

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:44.000
Hopefully their standards are much higher.

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:46.000
Making better decisions, let's say.

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:53.000
But I'm interested to see what it is. I know Lenovo's getting into, I think they're doing VR headsets too for like Windows holographic and stuff.

02:29:53.000 --> 02:30:03.000
So I'm curious to see how expensive it is, what software is on there, because I'm not buying a platform if it's just like one game or some shit.

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:06.000
You know, I need this to have some actual games with it.

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:13.000
Let me do another shoutout for our Skypline. Orange Lounge Radio, it's open right now if you want to give us a call.

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:20.000
The other thing too is they showed off some actual videos, so one of the other things they had was Star Wars, there was a battle going on in your living room.

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:29.000
And it did look kind of janky, so I'm guessing that was real footage that they're showing, and not like this hololens footage that looks way better.

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:31.000
The original Pokemon Go trailer.

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:37.000
It looked like real footage, so definitely go check it out if you're interested in finding out more about that.

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:41.000
The footage that they showed us is interesting, I guess. It's kind of gimmicky.

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:49.000
Kaijuto in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says it would be cool if they made a FaceTime app in AR that shows your friends as Star Wars holograms.

02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:52.000
Well, if Snapchat can do all that stupid shit.

02:30:52.000 --> 02:31:00.000
That was one of the things they were talking about. With Star Wars, we've had holograms and stuff in Star Wars, and we wanted to make that into your house.

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:08.000
Actually, one of the games that they announced was that 4D chess thing that they had. It's in Star Wars.

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:09.000
Oh yeah, in the cantina, yeah.

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:12.000
Yeah, so you're supposed to be playing AR chess and stuff, you can do that.

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:13.000
Nice.

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:22.000
I mean, I don't know, it's alright. I didn't get too excited about that. I wasn't like, oh shit, I gotta buy that. I was like, wow, they're making a headset? That's weird.

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:25.000
And then the Marvel thing is kind of like, that's neat.

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:35.000
Alright, one more call out for calls. Orange Launch Radio, all one word, on Skype. I guess everybody's watching the chairs of swords and all that stuff, so there you go.

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:38.000
Anything else, Loki?

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:43.000
No, but Mega Maker looks pretty cool.

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:44.000
Did you already download it and fire it up?

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:48.000
I downloaded it, I'm looking at the screenshots though. I'm curious to see how the level sharing works in that.

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:50.000
Yeah, I wanna check that out.

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:53.000
But I mean, I can see this as something that streamers will be playing around with.

02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:59.000
I'm sure. Well, but can Twitch make a category for it? I don't think they can. I guess they probably have to be in like, other.

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:09.000
Because it's not, I think Capcom's gonna take issue to it. I mean, we'll see. Maybe Capcom will embrace it. Maybe they'll say, oh, this is publicity.

02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:12.000
Can you put an ad for Mega Man Legacy in the beginning of it?

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:15.000
Honestly, I'm surprised that they didn't put out something like this.

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:19.000
Missed opportunity, I know, I know.

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:21.000
I mean, they still have the license for Mega Man.

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:26.000
Well, Mega Man Universe kind of looked like that's what it was gonna be. We'll never know.

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:34.000
And you know, not really gaming related necessarily, but they did release the first shot of Ready Player One, the movie.

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:35.000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:41.000
And of course, San Diego Comic Con, they're gonna have a Ready Player One movie panel with Steven Spielberg. I'm hoping for a trailer.

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:42.000
Ah, there'll be a trailer, you gotta get shot.

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:46.000
But yeah, it is coming out next March, so I am very excited by that.

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:47.000
Nice.

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:58.000
It was pretty cool. They showed, like, he's got his, you know, trailer that he's in with his headset and the haptic gloves, and he's got, like, an omnidirectional treadmill thing in the fucking suite.

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:06.000
Alright, we'll see. Comic Con, yeah, so what, we had D23 this week. Comic Con's next week. I mean, there's a lot of conventions.

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:15.000
I should have mentioned this in Housekeeping, but I'll mention it now. Dragon Con is only, like, six weeks away, and of course, if you're anywhere near Atlanta, you should be going to this event,

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:21.000
because certainly Bobby Blackwolf and I will be there. I think there will be some other VOG folks there as well, I'm pretty sure.

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:27.000
John's coming, and I think Brian from British Invaders is coming this year, I think I saw on Facebook.

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:31.000
So, but don't hold me to that, because I have a bad memory sometimes.

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:35.000
But there will certainly be some other VOG personalities there, and yeah, I'm very excited.

02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:43.000
I don't know what panels, but I know there will be at least a panel. There should be at least one panel, and hopefully a few more, so that'll be fun.

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:53.000
And just hanging out. No par six this year, which is unfortunate, they've moved that to virtual, but that just means another night, I don't have to be sober.

02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:55.000
Because for the par six, I had to be sober.

02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:57.000
No you didn't.

02:33:57.000 --> 02:34:01.000
Well, that's true, I didn't have to. But I'm a professional, Loki, I'm a professional.

02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:05.000
He just called out the wrong name, that's what they do in the major, like, award ceremonies anyways.

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:11.000
I wanted to be asked back in future years, but now I don't have to worry about that. So there you go.

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:20.000
Alright, well, our phones aren't lighting up, I guess y'all are being shy, or you're multitasking, doing your TV, and your HBOs and all that.

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:24.000
They put out the trailer for Dragon Ball FighterZ, showing Future Trunks.

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:26.000
Oh yeah? Oh, from EVO?

02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:28.000
Yeah, it's pretty nice.

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:35.000
S2100 Matt, also pointing out, speaking of conventions, MAGFest registration, including hotels, will be going up soon.

02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:40.000
Seems like August, yes, I love what they're doing with MAGFest hotels, they needed to do this years ago.

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:48.000
They are now going to require a one-night deposit on the Gaylord up front, and they're only sending the link for hotel reservations,

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:52.000
which everybody has a unique one, so you can't just, like, send the link to all your friends.

02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:56.000
They're sending the link for hotel registration when you buy a ticket.

02:34:56.000 --> 02:35:02.000
So, none of this, like, everybody mass trying to reserve on day one, just to hold it and then cancel it the day of.

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:07.000
So, I love what they're doing there for MAGFest, that's great, and so I'm excited.

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:14.000
MAGFest isn't guaranteed for me, y'all. It is not a guarantee right now, it just depends on a lot of factors.

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:18.000
I want to make it happen, but right now it's not a guarantee, but it's definitely on my list.

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:20.000
But I'll let you know as things develop.

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:23.000
So, it is a long way for me, though, remember guys.

02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:25.000
About that trailer, by the way.

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:26.000
Yeah.

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:28.000
I reposted it to my Facebook fan page.

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:29.000
Fun.

02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:30.000
So, I'll link it in the chat.

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:31.000
Awesome.

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:36.000
Alright, well, I think we are going to wrap things up here at Orange Lawn's Radio.

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:42.000
I know it's a little bit of a shorter show tonight, but we mentioned it was going to be lighter on the news and those things happen.

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:43.000
So, we're going to wrap it up, though.

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:48.000
We'll be back in seven days to talk about whatever gaming news might kind of come out of Comic Con or whatever happens.

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:49.000
There should be something.

02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:50.000
There should be something.

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:51.000
Whatever happens during the week.

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:59.000
I hope we find out something, like, I mean, it's been, we haven't heard anything yet, but remember that whole Square Enix Marvel thing.

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:05.000
I imagine that's still kind of early in development and that may be hiding out until E3 next year still.

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:06.000
Yeah, maybe.

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:07.000
We'll see.

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:10.000
I'm not going to get my hopes up too much on that, but yeah, don't get me wrong, I'd love to see that.

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:11.000
We'll see.

02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:13.000
Alright, that's it.

02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:14.000
We're done.

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:17.000
Thank you guys so much for listening to this week's episode of Orange Lawn's Radio.

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:21.000
As we always say here at Orange Lawn's Radio, if you enjoyed what you heard, I'm not going to ask for your money.

02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:28.000
I mean, if you want to send money, I have a Twitch channel and I think other folks have ways so you can contact them as well.

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:29.000
I have money.

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:30.000
There you go.

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:35.000
However, all we really ask is that you tell a friend or five about the show.

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:44.000
Spread the word because we're the show where every gamer has a voice, but if we got more people, maybe there'd be people that want to call in instead of watching Game of Thrones or whatever.

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:46.000
So yeah, just help us spread the word.

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:51.000
A nice five star review on a site like iTunes or Google Play or wherever it is you found this show.

02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:54.000
That goes a long way as well, so we really appreciate those.

02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:57.000
That's going to do it though, but first, final thoughts.

02:36:57.000 --> 02:37:04.000
I'd like to add, if people do want to give anything less than five, feel free to do so, but let us know why.

02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:07.000
If you're going to leave feedback, be constructive.

02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:09.000
Oh yeah, that's yeah.

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:13.000
And you know, well, I always say five star reviews because those are the ones that help.

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:15.000
But if you're going to leave something less, that's fine.

02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:17.000
But not like because they suck.

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:19.000
Like that doesn't do anything.

02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:21.000
That's why I said leave constructive feedback.

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:24.000
Or the one there, I don't think it was on this show.

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:26.000
I think it was on a Hoard House and that was still around.

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:29.000
Somebody left a one star review saying another show was better.

02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:35.000
And then I looked on that guy's reviews and it was all one star reviews on different Warcraft shows that this other show is better.

02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:39.000
And I was just like, wow, you just made that other show look like a shithole.

02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:41.000
And that's how you want to promote it.

02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:43.000
Don't you ever do that in the name of OLR.

02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:46.000
I swear to God, I say support indie podcasts, all of them.

02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:50.000
If you, if this isn't a five star show for you, there's no shortage.

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:52.000
The guys on the show was better.

02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:54.000
There's no shortage of video game shows out there for you to check out.

02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:59.000
But my point is that if you're going to leave a review of any kind, leave feedback on it.

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:01.000
Or leave what you like, what you don't like.

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:07.000
Because no, on any show out there, no one is going to know how to improve unless you leave your feedback.

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:10.000
And make sure that you're not a shithole about it.

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:12.000
Make sure that you are not a dick.

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:16.000
And if it is going to be one star feedback, you could always just email it to us.

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:20.000
Participate at OrangeNonsRater.com. You don't have to post it on iTunes for everybody to see.

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:22.000
All right. All right.

02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:25.000
But you can, I'm just saying, you can email us directly to our soccer with that feedback.

02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:27.000
You don't have to post it.

02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:29.000
Anyway, that's really going to do it though.

02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:31.000
It's time to get everybody's final thoughts.

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:33.000
Loki, your final thought.

02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:35.000
I'm going to try to work on my game some more.

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:37.000
I'm going to try.

02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:39.000
No guarantees because...

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:41.000
We all know better.

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:47.000
My capacity for being able to program late at night, it varies greatly.

02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:55.000
My final thought is I'm just about to the point in Final Fantasy XII where I'm going to pass how far I went on PlayStation 2.

02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:57.000
So I'm really excited about that.

02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:59.000
And I'm going to keep playing more of that this week.

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:04.000
So don't be surprised if next week's How Is Your Gaming Week was all about Final Fantasy as well.

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:06.000
Dark Sakura, last but not least, your final thought.

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:09.000
I'm going to dedicate a song to a mutual friend of ours.

02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:14.000
Listen to The Gambler by Kenny Rogers and take it to fucking heart.

02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:16.000
Alright.

02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:19.000
That's going to do it then for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:22.000
Goodnight everybody. We'll see you in seven days. Bye.

02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:25.000
