00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,160
This week, the next era of video games and non-interactive media is here on the heels

2
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,120
of a critically successful and renewed Castlevania series comes announcements of additional series,

3
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,120
movies and more.

4
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,700
Tonight, the next episode of Orange Island Radio is here, chock full of the week's gaming

5
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:31,700
news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

6
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:35,100
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

7
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,780
where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,780
It is Orange Lounge Radio.

9
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:46,500
Live tonight, episode number 695 for this July the 23rd of 2017.

10
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,420
We of course are three folks here based out of Sacramento, California to talk about video

11
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,580
games, gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle.

12
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:54,920
I am Rob Roberts.

13
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,920
She is DarkSakura.

14
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,920
Hi.

15
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,920
Hi.

16
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,920
How are you?

17
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,920
I'm okay.

18
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,500
So this is the last Sunday with Das Boot on your foot, right?

19
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,500
Yes.

20
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,700
So I'm going to decorate it with stars on Tuesday so that when they cut it off, it'll

21
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,500
be sparkly and my foot will be free.

22
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,800
And what's going to happen is I'm going for a pedicure.

23
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,660
Right when it's done, right after my doctor's appointment, I'm going to have a pedicure.

24
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,440
I don't care how gross my foot is.

25
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,180
As a lady should treat herself once in a while or a gentleman actually.

26
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,180
I had a pedicure once.

27
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,180
I was like, my toenails never looked better.

28
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,860
Well, it's really relaxing though to have someone scrub your feet.

29
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,820
Well, also there's that chair that.

30
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:31,820
Right.

31
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:32,820
Yeah.

32
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:39,500
And the other thing too is that I like that it's, well, the tips of my toes are actually

33
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,900
because I haven't been able to wear anything over my toes.

34
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:45,600
So the tips of my toes are actually really kind of scuffed up.

35
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,780
So it'll be nice to have like human feet again.

36
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:52,900
I'm kind of surprised no one has thought of a way to sell like bro-dicures or like target

37
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,660
men in that market somehow.

38
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,660
Like that.

39
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,660
Just call it metricures.

40
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:00,660
Look, I'm all for, you know, screw your gender norms and all that stuff.

41
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:05,220
But I understand the reality is most men view it as a girly thing.

42
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:08,220
But like, what if, what if like you fragile masculine?

43
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,220
I know.

44
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,220
I know.

45
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,220
I know.

46
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,220
Look, that's a whole nother issue.

47
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,220
But the reality is the society we live in.

48
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,220
Right.

49
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:18,060
So I mean, could, could there be a thing where like you could go like play games, video,

50
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,160
you're like playing Xbox while getting your feet scrubbed?

51
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,160
I don't know.

52
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,160
Yes.

53
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,160
Well, having, you know, a pedicure.

54
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,080
So how many people do text messages when they do it?

55
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,080
Right.

56
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,080
I don't know.

57
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,080
I could just do Pokemon go.

58
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,080
Like I'm doing right now.

59
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,080
All right.

60
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,540
I'm trying to get to level 29.

61
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,540
Tech master.

62
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,540
Loki is here.

63
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,540
Loki, would you get a bro-dicure?

64
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,540
No, no.

65
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,540
Why not?

66
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,540
It's expensive.

67
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:46,560
I accidentally, I accidentally wandered into like during like jury duty one year, I wandered

68
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:54,460
into a barbershop that was like a, a men's spa cause me like 40 bucks for a fucking

69
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,460
haircut.

70
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,460
So no thank you.

71
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:04,240
I just said the only men's spas I know ever the hookup joints, like an upscale, like get

72
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:09,480
your hair cut, get, you know, your, you know, face shade and stuff like fuck that.

73
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,520
I can just go to the bowling alley that has a barbershop in there and they'll charge you

74
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,360
like $20 for that.

75
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:19,600
Just as a rule of thumb, Loki, if a men's club is offering a steam room and they're

76
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,840
charging you 40 bucks to get in there, Loki, I don't think it's your cup of tea.

77
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,200
You don't want to go in there.

78
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,200
Duly noted.

79
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,280
All right.

80
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,360
Just a public service.

81
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,400
The advertisements are going to be pretty obvious what, Hey, you never know.

82
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,400
All right.

83
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,400
Going to our chat.

84
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,400
We do tape live.

85
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,120
Of course, believe it or not, it's a video game show and we do tape live every Sunday

86
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,280
night at the voice of geeks network vog network.com six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern

87
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,040
right after the Bobby black Wolf show, although not tonight, he's going through the whole

88
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,040
home transition.

89
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,480
He's talked about on his show.

90
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,280
So he wasn't able to join us tonight, but usually he's there and you can of course check

91
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,280
out his podcast feed or the podcast feed of many of the great shows that we share the

92
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,280
network with.

93
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,320
Like as far as gaming shows go, we have girls gone, wow.

94
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,040
Game buoy electric sisterhood.

95
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:06,000
And that's just, that's just some of many shows that we have that are great at the voice

96
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
of geeks network.

97
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,200
So check that out.

98
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:13,720
Going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, uh, JD and chat says gender is a construct

99
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,720
tear it apart.

100
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,720
Yes.

101
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,720
There you go.

102
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,720
There you go.

103
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,720
Darcy.

104
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,720
Oh, it's not just tearing it apart.

105
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,720
It's disintegration time.

106
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,200
Um, let's see, which was also a great album by the cure.

107
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:29,800
Speaking of defying gender norms, that was disintegration.

108
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,800
It wasn't disintegration time.

109
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,000
It was, I thought that was an album was disintegration in time.

110
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,800
Oh, I'll look it up now.

111
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,800
All right.

112
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,920
What are you thinking of fascination street?

113
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,920
Am I, I don't know.

114
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:44,440
Anyway, I'm also looking at an SSG100 Matt who says I had a pedicure once also my toenails

115
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,680
were never cut so well.

116
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,680
Yeah.

117
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,740
It just happens sometimes.

118
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,800
It was just called disintegration.

119
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,400
Athletes get pedicures all the time.

120
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,040
It's better on their feet to have someone work on them regularly.

121
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:59,120
And yeah, I think, um, certain types of diabetics have to get kind of pro feet treatment.

122
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,360
Also I am too ticklish for any of that.

123
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,360
Are you really?

124
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,360
Yeah, I can't.

125
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,360
That's kind of cute in an awkward way.

126
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,200
So the album was disintegration.

127
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,760
I know my cure albums.

128
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,360
Well I do too, but I knew I had my phase in high school.

129
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,760
I had said disintegration time and that wasn't it.

130
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,760
All right.

131
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,760
Fair enough.

132
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,760
All right.

133
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,560
So anyway, uh, we want to get to the kickoff topic tonight.

134
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,760
Look, it is a video game show.

135
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:24,440
I want to get to video games because we actually, we have a little bit of a cameo tonight.

136
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,160
I'm going to talk about that in a minute.

137
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,960
And yes, we'll talk about Comic-Con as well.

138
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,040
I know some of y'all are at Comic-Con so there was a few festivals going on this weekend.

139
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:36,840
So one of them was the Pokemon go festival that was happening in Chicago.

140
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:42,040
The very first time Niantic was doing an event live based on Pokemon go, but not the first

141
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,040
live Niantic event.

142
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:48,100
In fact, I feel like maybe I need to get a shirt made that says I survived a successful

143
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,360
Niantic event in Chicago.

144
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,400
You might be confused that this isn't their first event, but yeah.

145
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,400
All right.

146
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,880
Loki from the media perspective, from the news, what's been going on, what's being reported

147
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,400
on out there in the bloggy world.

148
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,400
It was a fucking shit show.

149
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,480
Is that the, is that the official Tom Brokaw line?

150
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,120
Yeah, basically.

151
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,640
So they had problems with it being very unplayable.

152
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:18,200
Apparently they did not have enough server space available for the players in the area

153
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:24,080
and it caused them not to be able to catch different Pokemon that were in there or to

154
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:30,480
battle some of these, you know, legendary Pokemon that they had.

155
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,160
So it was just, it was bad.

156
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,520
I mean, people were chanting, you know, fix the game, you know, that type of stuff.

157
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,600
So did you watch any of the feed on Twitch as it was going on?

158
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,160
I had logged into that like early and they hadn't actually shown anything yet.

159
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,840
And I was like, fuck, this ain't sitting here all day to watch this shit.

160
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,840
Yeah.

161
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:56,000
It was weird to me how the live stream was on and off, like it was like they would show

162
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,040
something for 10 minutes and then they'd be like, we're just going to show this static

163
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:03,520
image and you can hear the noises of the festival, but you can't see anything.

164
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,160
Now I had, I probably can't stream it with all the bandwidth.

165
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,960
I guess, I guess now I had always planned on Saturday because they did this whole thing

166
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:16,200
where they were like, okay, the people at Grant Park are going to be catching Pokemon

167
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:21,320
and the types of Pokemon that they catch are going to drive these bonuses.

168
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,560
And if everybody else in the world can catch a ton of Pokemon, although they never gave

169
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,240
numbers, if every everybody in the world catches these Pokemon, we're going to roll out these

170
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:34,280
bonuses for 24, 48 hours and who knows a mystery challenge, which we all fucking know was going

171
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,960
to be legendaries, right?

172
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:41,280
So I had always planned to go out with a pal downtown and we were going to go catch Pokemon.

173
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:46,760
And honestly, Saturday when we were out doing Pokemon during the measurement windows of

174
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:52,200
the event, which was our time, 9 AM to 9 30, then it was like 11, 11 31 to one 30.

175
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,280
So we went to, we didn't really know where to go.

176
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,120
So we were like, let's just go to the Capitol.

177
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,560
Cause that's a really crowded area and it has a ton of pokey stops, right?

178
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,640
So we went down there and there was, there was like a lot of people there playing the

179
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,640
game.

180
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:10,220
And for all those people that are like, Pokemon go is dead, which I'm sorry, but if you go

181
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:14,760
to a news site and they're running a headline that says Pokemon go is dead and I'm not going

182
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,760
to name names.

183
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,760
Okay.

184
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,760
I will.

185
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,760
It's Forbes.

186
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,800
But if you're going to go to a site like that, that runs those types of headlines, like you

187
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,800
need to be skeptical about how much this website, um, how would you say it?

188
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,800
Games exaggerates.

189
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,120
I think the gamers that like to exaggerate, when you're looking for your video game news,

190
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,640
do you think first, man, I got to go to Forbes and see what they've had with that.

191
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,600
Well, but Forbes is great at writing real fucking clickbait headlines and I'm, I'm in

192
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:44,680
a mood today, so I'm calling people out this week and I'm starting with Forbes because

193
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,680
I'm sick.

194
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,680
Yes.

195
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,680
Let the hatred fill.

196
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,820
No, I'm just, I'm fucking sick at the clickbait on that website.

197
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,600
It's not as bad as Motley fool.

198
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,180
That's the fucking worst.

199
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:59,080
But Forbes has some of the most clickbaity Nintendo hate boner things that they published

200
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,420
just to get Nintendo fans to click on their website.

201
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,200
So I'm just, I'm calling it like it is tonight.

202
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,360
I don't care.

203
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:11,940
So anyway, so if I see another Forbes article with a link that says Pokemon go is dead,

204
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,740
my eyes are going to roll so far back in my head, I can see my brain.

205
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:17,260
My point is people are still playing this game.

206
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:22,460
Is it as many as we're playing it when we had this cultural event back in July of last

207
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,460
year?

208
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:28,100
No, but is it pretty strong right now, especially compared to maybe three months ago when there

209
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,900
was, you know, not as much going on.

210
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:30,900
Yeah.

211
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:31,900
Yeah.

212
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,940
I mean, I think there's a lot of mobile games out there that would love to have what Niantic

213
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:35,940
has.

214
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:36,940
Right.

215
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:42,140
You know, from that perspective of what we were doing downtown, like it was actually

216
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,140
a lot of fun.

217
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:47,920
The game was running mostly fine except for the fact that the game has a tendency to crash

218
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,780
a lot on my iPhone, which is, I don't know if that's an Niantic issue or a phone issue

219
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:53,780
or like a phone issue.

220
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:54,780
I don't know.

221
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:58,040
Cause my other friends, like it crashes a lot.

222
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,720
Even an Allen, Allen has Android.

223
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,580
I have, I don't play it long enough for the crash maybe, or you don't use the Pogo plus,

224
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,580
which could be one of it.

225
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,580
I don't know.

226
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:11,340
But anyway, my point is, is that yes, there are still quite a few people playing the game,

227
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,340
right?

228
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,400
So of course there was a great interest in this event.

229
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,780
It sold out very quickly.

230
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:19,040
They had 20,000 people, some odd that were going to this event.

231
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,940
And so to hear that it turned out like, Oh, I don't know that fire festival that happened

232
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:26,140
in the Bahamas in some ways was, was pretty disappointing.

233
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:29,580
At least so unlike that fire festival, they got their money back.

234
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,700
Well, they also weren't trapped on a desert island.

235
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,700
Right.

236
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,420
So, I mean, there's that to be thankful for.

237
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:38,500
So anyway, here's my thing I could sit here and continue to theorize, well, based on what

238
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,300
I saw or based on what did, this is what must be happening at the festival.

239
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:46,100
Then I was like, wait a minute, Rob, wait a minute, Rob, you idiot, you know, somebody

240
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,580
that went to Chicago Pokemon go Fest.

241
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:53,720
Why don't you invite him on the show to talk about what it was really like at Pokemon go

242
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,720
Fest?

243
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,300
Cause you know, there's all this stuff in these publications that tend to games, exaggerate

244
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,860
things or focus on just the worst of it.

245
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,740
There may be some good that went with the bad.

246
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:11,820
So I reached out to my buddy Charles, also known as rock god of podcast or rock god of

247
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,080
pod on Twitter.

248
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:17,420
He is one of the hosts of the Pokemon go podcast, which is a show I plugged here a couple weeks

249
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,780
ago cause they were good enough to have me on it.

250
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:24,540
So I reached out to Charles, unfortunately he had another paying gig tonight so he could

251
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,440
not be here on the show live.

252
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,120
So we had to kind of work real fast.

253
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:35,560
He sent us a really lengthy audio clip explaining like his time at the festival.

254
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:39,080
Unfortunately I wanted to scale it back a little bit cause it was, you know, it is only

255
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,080
a three hour show here.

256
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,360
So I wanted to scale it back a little bit.

257
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,760
So I kind of cut out some of these parts that I want you guys to hear here.

258
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,600
So let's check in with, Oh, but if the audio is a little weird, it's because I edited it

259
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,700
like an hour ago.

260
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,540
So if there's any sloppiness, it's on my part.

261
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:57,360
So I apologize to Charles and to listeners for that.

262
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:01,720
Let's check in with Charles and check and see how his day kind of started over there

263
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,720
in Chicago.

264
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,680
Hey Rob, Jamie and Loki at Orange Lounge Radio.

265
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:11,200
It's the rock out of podcasting Charles Mcfall from Pokemon Go podcast.

266
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,640
And let me tell you what it was really like being there at Pokemon Go Fest.

267
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:20,800
Now line started at 6 AM and there were people out there, I'm sure at 6 AM, lined up.

268
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,240
Myself and the people I was traveling with, we walked from the hood that was about two

269
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,000
blocks away from the park.

270
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,240
And so we were walking down and as we came up on the park, there's this massive line

271
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,600
stretched out and we're like, Oh crap.

272
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,500
Because a lot of people, we had somebody standing in line for us for the early entry.

273
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:45,140
We did have early entry badges, which were supposed to get you in starting at 9 AM.

274
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:48,200
The general public started at 10 AM.

275
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:52,900
And the line, basically the short version is, that line was not for early entry.

276
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:57,000
That was for the regular entry people and it was already super long.

277
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:04,180
We got in, say 9.30, it took us about 30-ish minutes to make it around the fence and into

278
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,180
the entranceway.

279
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:08,740
And they were checking bags in, but it was honestly, they weren't checking them that

280
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:09,740
much.

281
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,740
They were just kind of moving people through.

282
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:16,740
Got in and everybody, we're all hyped, everybody's excited and you get this envelope, as you

283
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,940
walk in the door, you're handed an envelope and it has a real world patch that is the

284
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:26,600
exact same thing that you get in the game that's the medal in the game for being there

285
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,460
is a patch version of the medal.

286
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:33,500
And on the other side is a QR code and you had to go to any stop inside the park that

287
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:39,700
had a lot of temporary cool stops, which, and gyms, which tells us they can absolutely

288
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:46,100
do the stop slash gym for pay idea that we've been talking about on our show forever.

289
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,700
Anyway, and right down the middle as you come in is all the concessions and everything.

290
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:54,940
It was really actually, I'm going to say from a functional human being standpoint,

291
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:57,100
they did an amazing job setting this up.

292
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:01,720
It was easy to find the food, they had water stations, they had at least two if not three

293
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,900
water stations around to get you free water.

294
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:08,700
So you brought your own bottle, you can bring in two bottles of water sealed or empty pouches

295
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:13,140
or, and they actually didn't really think that strict about it.

296
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:19,260
The price is, I expected eight to ten dollars per person to eat and I'm talking about, you

297
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:23,820
know, you go to a festival and you're talking about, hey, pizza, pizza is ten bucks, water

298
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:31,300
is five dollars, don't you, no, my pizza, my honest to God, real Chicago restaurant,

299
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,620
you know, they made it in the restaurant and brought it to the park very quickly.

300
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,140
It was still hot when it got there.

301
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:43,180
Real Chicago slice pizza, now hold up my fingers like you can see me, but a big huge triangle,

302
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:46,500
five bucks, five bucks, a bottle of water was like two dollars.

303
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,860
It was insanely cheap to be there.

304
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,060
That was really cool.

305
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:54,220
Let me jump, let me, let me jump in here for a minute to talk about some of what Charles

306
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,740
said there.

307
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,380
And obviously, sorry about some of the audio there.

308
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:02,200
There's some tearing effects in audio and the audio that we got sent.

309
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:06,760
But my understanding is that Charles like actually recorded that in a car in a parking

310
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,680
lot on the way to one of his gigs.

311
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,800
So really appreciate him taking the time out to do that.

312
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,720
But some of the audio was a little shaky, I didn't have time to clean it, clean it up.

313
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,260
On that note, I noticed there was some bad and there was some good in there.

314
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,600
So it sounds like Charles was fortunate.

315
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,780
He had this early entry thing and a buddy.

316
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,860
So he got into this thing early.

317
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:28,720
But there was this huge line, you guys all saw this on the media and some of the Twitter,

318
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,720
right?

319
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:34,960
There was this huge line, sorry, this huge line going around the whole place that was

320
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,040
it was hard for people to get in and stuff, right?

321
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,960
So I mean, it was taking like forever for people to get into this place.

322
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,400
And what blew my mind about it is that it sounded like from what Charles is saying there,

323
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,520
they really weren't doing much.

324
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:49,480
They weren't really like scanning the bags that deeply or whatever.

325
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,600
So what was taking so long?

326
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,400
And here's the other thing.

327
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,900
So now comparing Charles's experience to my experience a little bit when I went to Niantic's

328
00:15:55,900 --> 00:16:00,520
Ingress anomaly over Veterans Day weekend last year when I missed the show.

329
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,520
That's where I was at.

330
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,600
I was at a Niantic event in Chicago.

331
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:09,240
They did check ins the night before for the Ingress event, you were able to go to a bar

332
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:14,320
that was in the downtown area and you could check in at the bar the night before and get

333
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,320
your stuff.

334
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,200
And then, you know, we all went to the anomaly.

335
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:22,000
Now granted, I understand there was maybe 1,500 people that did the Ingress event compared

336
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,320
to what, 20,000.

337
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,320
So I obviously understand the size.

338
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,560
Which I think would be all the more reason they have to check in the night before.

339
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,120
That's what blew my mind is I was like, why didn't they do check ins the night before?

340
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,320
Were they that concerned about resales, spoofers?

341
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,600
I don't know what it was, but it really blew my mind that like for this smaller event Niantic

342
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,240
did something, but then for this larger event they didn't.

343
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,800
But then Charles does point out there is some good stuff that you're not hearing about in

344
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,800
these news stories.

345
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,480
It sounds like from a functional standpoint, you know, the vendors were reasonable and

346
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,560
they weren't trying to price gouge people or any of that stuff.

347
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:01,320
And that, you know, as far as like a, am I going to get food and water situation?

348
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,320
It was fine.

349
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,600
Unlike, you know, even though we're joking about Fire Festival, those people that were

350
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,180
trapped in the Bahamas were having a food and water situation as well, which is a lot

351
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,180
more serious.

352
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:15,540
But it sounds like that was never an issue with the Pokemon Go Fest and that that was

353
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,720
doing very well.

354
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,140
So let me continue on with another clip from Charles.

355
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:24,540
And so we get over this all at 930 in the morning and we get over there and I'm spending

356
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:27,100
some stuff and the game starts kind of getting clunky.

357
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:31,060
I'm trying to go into a raid and I'm like, well, I'm going to fight this Pikachu raid.

358
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,820
Raid battles were free all day long.

359
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,020
Did not take any passes at all.

360
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:40,220
Raid battles inside the park, 100% free.

361
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,220
And they were doing them.

362
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:46,500
They would be a 10 minute warning time, like a regular start in 10 minutes and then pop

363
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,580
into 14 minute uptime.

364
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,700
And they had gyms.

365
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,260
I think they had eight gyms in there.

366
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:58,340
So there's plenty of places for people to play and get to.

367
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:01,900
And I started to do the Pikachu raid and I hit the thing and put me in a room and it

368
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:05,180
kind of locked and didn't do anything and the game crashed.

369
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,460
And somebody else was like, I can't get the QR code work.

370
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:11,060
They were having issues and they finally got theirs to work.

371
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,980
And that's at 930 in the morning.

372
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:18,880
So already it's like, hmm, at 10 o'clock, I don't know when they actually started the

373
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,860
actual public coming in.

374
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:24,760
They had a big enough gate that you could funnel both lines in easily.

375
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:29,900
But the thing is that nine o'clock early band, they gave out way too many of those bands

376
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:37,820
because at 1030, almost 11 on the backside of the park, I mean, the line would be super,

377
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:38,820
super long.

378
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:43,220
People were still there and we didn't go up and ask, are you in the early entry line?

379
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:49,860
But this is, this is at 11 o'clock almost, no, it is about 1030, I guess it's about 1030.

380
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:53,940
And the early entry quotey fingers people seem to be still lined up and trying to come

381
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,300
in.

382
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:59,020
I've heard that it took three hours of standing in line.

383
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:04,980
I'm not talking about the early guy here at 6 a.m. people from the time 10 o'clock hit,

384
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:10,300
it took three hours to get through the general public line and get into the park.

385
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,940
But that's, that was frustrating for a lot of people.

386
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:15,700
And I was tweeting that we had some friends who did not get early passes that were in

387
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:19,380
the general and they were tweeting, they spoke among their radio.

388
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:23,460
And we're telling them, you're not missing anything, we can't play, nothing's connecting

389
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,460
here.

390
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,220
1030, 11, maybe it's closer to 11.

391
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:31,580
They said, all right, everybody come to the main stage, we're gonna kick this thing off.

392
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:34,660
And I'm looking around the house like, there's only maybe a thousand people in the park right

393
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,660
now.

394
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,660
Maybe two.

395
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,660
I mean, it's always a huge open space.

396
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:41,660
It's hard to kind of gauge how many people are in, but like, of the 20,000 people supposed

397
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:45,100
to be here, you haven't gotten very many in the park yet.

398
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:50,100
What's interesting about that is that watching the live feed, I would not have guessed that

399
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,140
they had not filled the park yet.

400
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:56,380
In fact, my thought was, I'm hearing all this stuff on Twitter about all these people stuck

401
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,260
in line, which Charles talks about there.

402
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:03,500
Can you imagine you travel from California, and some people came further, you travel from

403
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:08,220
California to Chicago to go to the first Pokemon Go event only to stand in line for three hours

404
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:12,980
and know that you're missing the first event inside the park, even though punchline, no

405
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:17,140
one in the park can play either, but the people outside may not actually know that.

406
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,860
So can you imagine how frustrated like people are gonna be at this event?

407
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:23,820
And this is why things started to get ugly, which we're gonna hear about in a little bit.

408
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:29,180
But with the whole, you know, what Charles is talking about with the lines and everything,

409
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:35,380
I mean, again, I'm blown away that Niantic did not have line management for 20,000 people,

410
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:40,260
and then it took three hours for people to get into this event, which was part of the

411
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,920
ugliness to begin with, right?

412
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:45,780
So again, why didn't they do check-ins the day before for some people, and why didn't

413
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,700
they have more staff, more points of entry?

414
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,340
It should be simple math, right?

415
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,340
How long it's gonna take one person to process...

416
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,340
They know how many tickets they sold.

417
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:58,420
Well, yeah, they know exactly how many tickets they sold, and so they should know how long

418
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,180
it's gonna take to process those people.

419
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,180
That blows me away.

420
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:05,220
I mean, I know a lot of anime conventions and stuff have long waits sometimes, but,

421
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,180
you know, again, a lot of rookie mistakes.

422
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,580
Cough Cough Anime Expo.

423
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:12,700
Well, a lot of rookie mistakes sometimes with this stuff.

424
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:19,100
I remember Square Enix's first Final Fantasy Fan Fest in 2014 was a huge problem because

425
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:23,840
they had a printer break, and they didn't have a backup printer.

426
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,300
So all those people had to wait while somebody, like, ran to Office Depot to get a printer

427
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,300
or something like that.

428
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,380
It was crazy.

429
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:34,100
So anyway, I don't know if there was more stuff like that at Pokemon Go Fest or what.

430
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:39,100
Anyway, I did cut some stuff here about, Charles was talking about some of the, like, shirts

431
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:42,760
and things they were selling in the park were not a great quality.

432
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:46,420
Like they just weren't even selling Team Valor or anything.

433
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:50,060
Apparently the bootleggers outside, because you know there's always bootleggers, bootleggers

434
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:53,140
had better stuff from what Charles was saying.

435
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:57,020
But I want to get to this next clip because Charles says something here that I think is

436
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:01,500
really damning for the whole excuse Niantic is giving us.

437
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,500
So listen up.

438
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:08,100
If people start chanting, we can't log in, we can't connect, or something like that.

439
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,140
I forget what the chant was.

440
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:13,900
But they're yelling at her, and she's ignoring it, and the first person she introduced is

441
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,900
John Hanke.

442
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:15,900
And people are, boo!

443
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:21,460
They're like, no, no, we understand, things are, you know, we're working on it.

444
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:26,980
He handled it well, but I mean there was somebody so loud up front yelling at him that was coming

445
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:30,700
through the microphone a little bit and back out to the PA so we could kind of hear it.

446
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:35,740
And he handled it like a pro, I mean he took his punches, but they were like, you know,

447
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,740
but he did.

448
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,580
And that was a major mistake to me.

449
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:44,260
Oh no, we're contacting the cell places, and I'm going, in my mind, I'm going, okay, and

450
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:47,860
actually I said this to the people around me, here's the bottom line on the cell service,

451
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:54,380
you'll hear all kinds of rumors about contract obligations, blah, blah, bullshit.

452
00:22:54,380 --> 00:23:01,740
Here's the thing, now in the real world there are absolutely coverage areas, right?

453
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:06,700
So some parts of the park had much better service with Verizon than in other parts of

454
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,740
the park.

455
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:11,300
But that was true for AT&T, you know, it all kind of covered a little differently.

456
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:16,140
But here was the thing, even at that point, there's maybe, like I said, maybe 2,000 people

457
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:22,860
at the most, which would not overload any cell tower anywhere.

458
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:27,340
And they're like, yeah, we're working with them, you can see that, notice your servers,

459
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:31,740
because I can livestream, which I did, I did some livestreams right there from the park,

460
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:36,580
I can Twitter, I can get my messages, I can get on Discord, I can open up another game

461
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:42,020
and play it, I can do all kinds of stuff on my phone that touches the internet, but

462
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,540
I cannot play your game.

463
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:50,820
I can Twitter, I can Discord, I can livestream, do you know how much bandwidth it takes to

464
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:54,020
livestream but I can't play your game?

465
00:23:54,020 --> 00:24:01,260
And you're going to go blame the cell towers as the issue, but I can livestream, huh, isn't

466
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,260
that funny?

467
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:08,100
Maybe if he wasn't livestreaming, they'd have enough bandwidth for the game.

468
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:11,300
Damn it, Charles, you broke the whole damn thing.

469
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,300
You single-handedly broke Go Fest with your livestream.

470
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:17,220
No, I'm not surprised that their servers are crap.

471
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:21,020
But I mean, and I think Charles brings this up, and I think it's in something that I cut

472
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:25,560
out, but he brings up that, you know, Dragon Con, 80,000 people, people play this game

473
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:29,180
at Disneyland every day, they don't have problems.

474
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:33,180
It was something about what they were doing with this event and the restrictions they

475
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:38,460
were putting on this event, some of the graphical issues of the game, and just the poor optimization

476
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:43,560
I guess all around of the game, really, in some ways, it kind of all contributed to this.

477
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:49,020
But to blame the cell networks when people are able to be on Twitter, livestream, tell

478
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:52,700
the rest of the internet what a shitty time they're having, that's a little disingenuous.

479
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:57,980
Yeah, I can understand if they couldn't, if internet access was a problem, that would

480
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:02,740
make more sense, but that's not the case, especially when it's only your game, that's

481
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,820
not working.

482
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:07,100
So here was the first thing I thought of, the first thing I thought of when I heard

483
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:12,780
all of this was going down yesterday was, why didn't they just have Wi-Fi?

484
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:18,220
And granted, 20,000 people is probably a lot to have on Wi-Fi, but they do it at airports

485
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:23,500
somehow, and you know, I'm sure at least even if they, let's say they could only get, maybe

486
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:27,720
the VIP people that got in early also got the Wi-Fi, I don't know.

487
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:33,320
So maybe 2,000 people get on Wi-Fi, well that's still 10% off the rest of this if you're

488
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:37,180
going to blame the networks, which I'm not so sure, obviously based off the livestreaming

489
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,440
comment that it really is.

490
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,440
But still, I think that question, why wasn't there Wi-Fi?

491
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,240
Well, Charles has an answer.

492
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:48,040
They did not have the Wi-Fi as promised, but there was, I heard, again, these are quote

493
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:52,480
rumors, they didn't announce this, but I heard that because of the massive rainstorms that

494
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,640
came through on Friday, and there were massive rainstorms on Friday, I guess so, a little

495
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:01,040
bit Friday night, they weren't able to set up the Wi-Fi stuff, and it was even raining

496
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:05,760
a little bit Saturday morning, but then the sun came out by 9 o'clock and it was gorgeous

497
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,240
all day.

498
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:13,040
Anyway, so they did the hunt, and most people can't do it, so then they call everybody back

499
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:21,040
to the stage, and now it's worse, people are booing and yelling, and finally she just stopped

500
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:26,640
talking and just left the stage, that was it, she basically got booed off the stage.

501
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,520
And so we started milling around, so the rest of the day is much shorter than that first

502
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:35,920
part of the story, the rest of the day, things got better, I ended up, I couldn't play at

503
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:41,720
all until, I mean, like I said, I was there at 9.30, couldn't play at all until 12.30,

504
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,640
and the only way I could play there, I call it the filthy casual mode, right, you just

505
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:50,640
turn on your plus, or for me the gotcha, which is even more filthy casual, because it's automatic,

506
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,200
and that's it, you don't play the game, you just let it run in the background and see

507
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,440
what it spins, what it catches.

508
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,440
That became the only way for me to play, I could get my game to come up just long enough

509
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:04,840
to connect it to my gotcha and then close the screen, and it would start throwing regular

510
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,840
pokeballs at whatever was around me.

511
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,520
A lot of things were getting better, people were getting pissed, but here's the thing,

512
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:15,800
the line to get out, so they had an in and out policy, and you had to do your wristband,

513
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:21,240
you boop it out, as I say, you just boop, and you're out, and they stamped you too apparently,

514
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,920
but then you can come back in, and you boop back in.

515
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:32,800
The line to leave was so long, people were just staying out of frustration, because it

516
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:36,920
was taking you an hour to try to even get out of the park, you might as well just stay,

517
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:40,240
but some of the experience, the dream that we were sold, right, of everybody playing

518
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,000
together and doing this, some of that absolutely was present, because I'm standing on the sidewalk

519
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:53,680
and all of a sudden the crowd politely, some kind of run, nobody's pushing, nobody's, but

520
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:57,400
nobody's pushing, everybody's polite, and they move en masse to this area, and they're

521
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,440
like, what's going on?

522
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:03,760
There's a Heracross over here, and you get to hear people are trying to get, oh yeah,

523
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:08,320
oh my god, I got it, oh no, oh no, oh no, wait, you know, that experience was absolutely

524
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,440
in small droves there.

525
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:16,720
And you know, I've been feeling a lot of that this weekend, too, throughout Pokemon Go,

526
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:21,120
because now that they've unleashed those legendaries, you know, if you didn't already hear, you

527
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:26,240
can get Lugia and Articuno, but I might be saying that wrong, because I thought it was

528
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,760
Arctic, anyway, but those legendaries are out there, and you can go catch them now,

529
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:34,720
and I got to tell you, I've had some really rad experiences, like, you know, I got at

530
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:40,480
a Discord and an Articuno spawn year here, and met up with some other people, people

531
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:46,360
I didn't know, but other nerds from all, all types of people, men, women, all different

532
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:50,960
shapes, sizes, colors, all that, just wanting to get their damn legendary in their Pokedex,

533
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,680
and that was really cool, to kind of like come together and do that, and then we played

534
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:58,720
some more, in fact, I almost, I almost killed myself playing Pokemon Go today, because I

535
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,160
was an idiot, and they've been doing all these bonuses all weekend, like the double, well

536
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:05,080
not all weekend, but since the event, the double Stardust and everything, I thought

537
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:09,120
it would be a good idea to go play Pokemon Go in the 100 degree heat today, even though

538
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:12,800
yes, I had sunblock, yes, I was hydrating myself, but it was still maybe a little bit

539
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:17,960
much, but anyway, I'm okay, I didn't pass out, like I thought I was going to for a minute,

540
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:23,200
but we, I was even able to do the Lusia fight, we won it, and there was like, there was 40

541
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,680
people there, in the middle of downtown Roseville, doing this Lusia fight, when these things

542
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:33,520
are spawning everywhere right now, 40 people in the middle of a suburb, just there to do

543
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:38,240
this stupid game, so I mean, some of that that's been happening is, is really awesome,

544
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:43,480
so it's, it's kind of a bummer that Niantic is still like, I guess too small of a company

545
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:48,880
or something to figure out some of these technical issues, because the game they've got is fucking

546
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:56,160
great, when it works, which unfortunately is only about half the time, and I gotta say

547
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:02,320
too, because some of our folks in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, let's see, over at

548
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:07,200
live.vognetwork.com, they're talking about the host, I guess her name is Rachel Seltzer,

549
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:13,200
I don't know her, but vidpower in chat says she's an esports commentator, and probably

550
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,840
what Charles doesn't know, being on the ground, if he was a little far back from the stage,

551
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:20,200
but what you could see on the live stream, I think she left the stage because someone

552
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,680
threw a shoe at her, or a bottle or something at her, and it wasn't safe to be out there,

553
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:29,920
and I think that's the real reason she left, which, you know, I understand people are pissed,

554
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:33,480
but that's a shitty thing to do, and if you threw that, you should feel bad, because you're

555
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:38,840
a bad person, you know, because do you think she's the one that, like, went and unplugged

556
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,040
the AT&T van?

557
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,040
Do you think that was her idea?

558
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,040
No.

559
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,960
Especially if it's a shoe, because now you're missing a shoe.

560
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:47,200
I think it was a bottle, I don't think, I always assume a rock concert or something

561
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,080
is a shoe, but whatever it was, whatever they fucking threw at her, it's not okay, it's

562
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:57,360
not cool, and look, I get that she was a little cheesy, I understand that, I did feel a little

563
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,440
bit like, wow, tone it down, honey, but...

564
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:03,160
Can we stop having influencers at these events, please?

565
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:07,080
I think it's part that, it's part influencers, but then I also have to remember, there are

566
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:11,520
a lot of children that play Pokemon Go, and if you ever turn on Nickelodeon, you see a

567
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:15,760
lot of people that are like her, so I kind of have to, like, go, okay, maybe, maybe she's

568
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:21,180
not for me, she's for the kids, and, you know, whatever, but I also kind of agree that influencers

569
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:26,080
as hosts, I don't know about that, but anyway, that's, that's another debate for another

570
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,080
time.

571
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,120
I want to get to the final thought here, I do want to caution, this last clip does have

572
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:35,000
a little bit of audio tearing in it, but I did think it was important for Charles to

573
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,840
get his final thoughts out here in this clip from being on the ground at Pokemon Go Fest.

574
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:45,240
But this is the last thing I'll say, is, how do they not understand the effing tech that

575
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,240
goes into this?

576
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,720
How do you understand, I get on launch, you never anticipated this, but you know at this

577
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:56,560
point, what happens when you go into a new country, all of a sudden, damn, you're flooded,

578
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:01,240
you launch a brand new thing like the gym revamp, bam, things kind of break, and that's

579
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:06,720
tech, I get that, but when you're doing a festival, you had to have had this stuff launched

580
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,800
two weeks ago in the code.

581
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:16,920
I don't care if it's, I don't care about data miners, you had to have this launched two

582
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:21,960
weeks ago, so you could have beta tested it in your office, just made your office a special

583
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:27,640
playground, you know, with that geo-locking, worked it out, got triple the amount of servers

584
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:33,600
you're going to need, paid whatever you had to pay to all the cell providers to make sure

585
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:38,800
they were boosting signal or whatever, it just was frustrating that they don't seem

586
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:43,840
to ever understand how this tech works, and how it affects the community, but lots of

587
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:47,400
people were happy, met a lot of strangers, talked to a lot of people, and it was a lot

588
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,400
of fun.

589
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:52,960
I really do, I left there, especially with getting, knowing I was going to get the lugia

590
00:32:52,960 --> 00:33:01,960
anyway, leaving there, I left feeling good, and I feel like this year's going to be a

591
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:06,200
hard learning curve for them, but if they really are committed to doing this again,

592
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:11,960
doing more, they're really going to have to hire some massive event planners that do outside

593
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,960
events.

594
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,880
I mean, I'm talking about big companies that are going to cost you some money, but they

595
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:20,120
know exactly what to do, and then really get their servers right.

596
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,120
So that's it.

597
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:27,400
I'm Charles with Polymer, I've got a podcast, and check out Pokemon Go Podcast at PokemonGoPodcast.com,

598
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,760
and we're here, and we're honored to have Rob on a couple of weeks ago, got lots of

599
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:35,800
great feedback from you, man, everybody's loved you, so definitely come back again.

600
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,680
I absolutely will, Charles, and thank you so much for leaving that.

601
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:44,140
Again, I had to edit down a 27-minute message down to the 10 or 11 minutes we played here,

602
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:47,180
but Charles took time out of his day to leave that for us, and I really, really appreciate

603
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:50,540
that, especially with such a fast turnaround, because I literally messaged him last night,

604
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:53,780
like, we should really get you on OLR this week since you were there, and I want to know

605
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:54,820
what it was like on the ground.

606
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:56,580
So thank you, Charles, for leaving that message for us.

607
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:59,080
Everybody check out Pokemon Go Podcast.

608
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:03,900
He will tell much more about a lot more of the details on that program, but I want to

609
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:08,260
thank him for giving us a little preview here.

610
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:12,740
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Land Radio at vognetwork.com,

611
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:15,420
use the passphrase, bread.

612
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:47,380
I've got to come a point where I have to give Niantic a little tough love, and it's time

613
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:51,220
for Niantic to grow the fuck up or sell.

614
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:55,780
Like this, from my perspective, this is the crossroads, Niantic is that, and this festival

615
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,660
kind of only proves that for me.

616
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:01,900
They either need to grow the fuck up, meaning they're going to have to get the bodies in

617
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:06,620
there, they're going to have to get the investors or the people, or somehow raise the funds

618
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:11,860
to get the staffing and be the large company that a game like Pokemon Go needs, or sell

619
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,900
to a company who can do it.

620
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:17,660
Because after this whole thing happened, my honest to God first reaction, I heard they

621
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:20,580
went up on stage and said, everybody's getting a refund and we're going to give out a hundred

622
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,980
dollars in pokey coins.

623
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:25,620
My honest to God reaction was, they're going to be sold next week.

624
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:30,300
Niantic's going to be forced to sell to somebody next week to a company who can handle the

625
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,300
infrastructure.

626
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,860
God, please don't sell the Nintendo.

627
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:35,060
They can't handle the infrastructure.

628
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:38,540
Here's the weird thing, Niantic was a Google company.

629
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:42,620
The only reason Niantic is no longer a Google company is because Google did that whole alphabet

630
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:46,300
split that they did a couple years ago, and Niantic was kind of left out of that, but

631
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:50,220
that was because they had the backing from Nintendo now.

632
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:52,220
But we didn't know that at the time, we know it now.

633
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:55,460
They had the backing from Nintendo, and Google is still a major backer in this.

634
00:35:55,460 --> 00:36:00,900
So I sort of think it would make a lot of sense for Google to kind of bring them back,

635
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:06,220
but at the same time, there's a lot of business elements there that I will fully admit I don't

636
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:12,900
understand, but I just feel like after the disaster that happened in Chicago, something's

637
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,000
got to give.

638
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,540
This game has got to grow the fuck up, because there's a lot of potential in this game that

639
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:27,340
keeps getting ruined by technical things that can't be handled, and again, I think one of

640
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:32,060
the most damning things is what Charles pointed out there, the whole fact that Niantic is

641
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:36,500
trying to blame the cell phone companies, yet I was live streaming.

642
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,500
I was tweeting.

643
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,600
I was on Discord.

644
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,180
It's not the cell phone companies.

645
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:45,180
It's your game.

646
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,180
Any thoughts, Loki?

647
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:49,300
I know you're a Pokemon, Dark Soccer, anything you guys want to add based on what Charles

648
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,380
said and your thoughts on the event?

649
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,380
I don't know.

650
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:59,820
I played a little bit this weekend while I was at a park with my kids, and I was expecting

651
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,740
some different spawns.

652
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:07,460
I got a Poliwag or whatever that is, which I thought was a water Pokemon, so it was kind

653
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:11,620
of weird that it was spawning that park.

654
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:15,180
But yeah, other than that, I was like, eh, I don't want to play this anymore.

655
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:18,380
Let me get to some comments from our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, because of course

656
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:22,100
we do tape live Sunday nights at 6 Pacific 9 Eastern at vognetwork.com.

657
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:27,420
JD over in chat says, how many chances are we going to continue to give Niantic to get

658
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,420
their shit together?

659
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:32,500
They have clearly demonstrated that they learned absolutely nothing from the past year

660
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,500
of running the game.

661
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:38,420
Sj100Matt says, if you, Niantic, didn't expect this outcome, then you didn't learn from the

662
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:41,420
disaster when the game first came out.

663
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:45,180
Let's see, JD wonders, who would Niantic even sell to?

664
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:49,980
Like I mean, I don't think Google would take them back, Sj100Matt proposes Amazon.

665
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:56,820
Come on, Noel Gus says, Niantic is that X that you can't quit, but should.

666
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:00,140
That's kind of how I feel about Ingress once in a while, it's like, I really need to break

667
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,140
up with you.

668
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,140
I did play a little bit of Ingress.

669
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:05,420
Yeah, it's like, once in a while, the sex is kind of good, you know?

670
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:07,940
Well, it was just like, okay, here's why I played Ingress.

671
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:10,740
Blowing up a portal feels real good once in a while.

672
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:14,540
Here's why I played Ingress this weekend, because I was playing Pokemon Go and I caught

673
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:18,300
all the Pokemon in the area that I was sitting in and nothing was spawning.

674
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,900
I was like, okay, fuck this shit.

675
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:20,900
Went to Ingress.

676
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,380
Oh, hey, there's an unclaimed portal.

677
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,380
Captured it.

678
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,380
Hacked it.

679
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:28,420
Shut it off.

680
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:32,820
Stoppy in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says about Charles's clip, this is like listening

681
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,100
to a police confession.

682
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,100
Maybe he was wearing a wire.

683
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:38,340
It was, it was a little bit like that, but as we know, Charles live streaming may have

684
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:40,100
brought down the entire event.

685
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,500
We heard that.

686
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:47,340
Let's see, act deft in chat says, I won't ever go back to Ingress, Sj100Matt says, I

687
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:52,020
would buy it if they came out and said people were spoofing location or DDoSing to mess

688
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,020
up the event.

689
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:55,940
I mean, that's a gimme excuse, but the game was working everywhere else.

690
00:38:55,940 --> 00:39:00,540
And again, I want to point out, it's not all necessary, necessarily bad news.

691
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:05,420
And that's why I'm not willing to say, because that would be a game's adoration.

692
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:09,880
That would be a Forbes headline to say this game is shit, write it off as the shit it

693
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:15,180
is and stop playing that shit because Pokemon Go isn't shit.

694
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:22,180
It's just some of the tech behind it and some of the support the game is getting is shit.

695
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,180
I don't know about that.

696
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:25,980
There's still no game to it yet, other than collecting Pokemon.

697
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:31,260
I think the gym, I think the gym thing really, really revitalized, it gave the game a kick

698
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:37,820
in the ass that it needed, but there's still no scoring, no game, no like, you know, teams.

699
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:39,380
It doesn't fucking matter.

700
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:44,820
I still think for the folks that are collecting, there's a lot there to do and the team bonuses.

701
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:47,960
Trust me, you need those extra balls when you're catching those legendaries.

702
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,580
So you know, there's, is it perfect?

703
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:51,580
No.

704
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:55,060
Any mobile game that wants to stay relevant should continue to invent itself every few

705
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,060
months.

706
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,100
But anyway, I know this topic's gone on a long time.

707
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:02,020
Again, I really want to thank Charles for leaving us that message and being kind of

708
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:05,800
a guest correspondent tonight on the show and I want to encourage anybody who does love

709
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:11,260
Pokemon Go like I still do, but even you still get frustrated with people that you love once

710
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:15,880
in a while, check out Pokemon Go podcast because there's a lot of great discussion there and

711
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:20,780
I'm sure he'll tell us much more that we didn't get here on the show tonight.

712
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:25,560
But yeah, I mean, it's going to be an interesting next couple weeks to see what the fallout

713
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,800
truly is from this.

714
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,480
And if Niantic really does try to do this again in 2018, you know, John Hanke teased

715
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:35,120
on stage a Pokemon Go 2018 and this was before the refund chat.

716
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:38,160
So we'll see, we'll see.

717
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,160
All right.

718
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,600
Anyhow, let's move on.

719
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,640
We got to get to some more stories because there's a lot of gaming stories that happened

720
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:48,260
this week, but of course, uh, it would not be a show unless we talked about our own gaming

721
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:50,640
weeks and the types of video games that you've been playing this week.

722
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,320
So Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

723
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:58,300
Uh, I finally beat the main story of Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2, um, while streaming with

724
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,720
all of three people watching at 3 AM.

725
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,800
Um, it was fun.

726
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,800
It's cute.

727
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:10,000
I will go back and replay all the scenarios, um, in order for anyone who wants to see them.

728
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,800
Um, that's kind of it other than the cell phone games.

729
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,960
Uh, and so you are streaming again, so if people aren't following you on Twitch, they

730
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:19,960
can follow you at...

731
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:25,080
Basically stream me when I'm bored, but it's DarkSakura underscore O-L-R.

732
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,080
Okay, awesome.

733
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:30,300
Um, and you are hosted, I double checked the VoG network, uh, or the VoG network on Twitch

734
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,300
hosts you automatically.

735
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:35,920
So, all right, I'll set up all the hosting stuff, but like I spent like an hour or so

736
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,680
putting together my offline banner and whatnot, which is...

737
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:39,680
It's important.

738
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:45,960
It's a combination of the style for the Danganronpa things and then my Dragon Ball character.

739
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:48,720
Are you going to continue to Dragon Ball or is there other games you're looking at doing?

740
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,960
Are you going to do Dream Daddy?

741
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,760
Because that's the one everybody's doing right now.

742
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:56,960
I haven't bought Dream Daddy yet, so I'm not going to play that one since everyone else

743
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,960
is.

744
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:58,960
Yeah.

745
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:04,860
But I'm probably going to do, um, uh, Danganronpa, Ultra Despair Girls, and, uh, How to Fool

746
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:07,200
Boyfriend and Holiday Star down the line.

747
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,200
Nice.

748
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:13,160
Um, I don't know, I'll find something else kind of weird and interesting to stream.

749
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,160
All right.

750
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,920
Loki, how was your gaming week?

751
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,360
I didn't really play anything, honestly.

752
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:22,800
I played very little of, um, the Office Space Clicker game.

753
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,400
I'm kind of getting bored of it.

754
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:31,240
Um, and then Pokémon GO, I really, I haven't really played that much this week, maybe once

755
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:36,720
or twice at the most, and Ingress, like I said, I touched it for like maybe two minutes

756
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,160
and that was it.

757
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:44,480
I meant to play Superhot VR, because I have that now, but, um, I just hadn't gotten around

758
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,880
to setting it up.

759
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:50,640
I still want to get one of those Oculus Rift, but $400 is a lot of money right now.

760
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,640
Yeah, it is.

761
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:56,680
I still want it, but yeah, it's hard to like, if I'd known that like a couple months ago,

762
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:00,800
I could have budgeted better, but yeah, it's not working out right now.

763
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:01,800
All right.

764
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:02,800
Uh, my gaming week.

765
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,880
Obviously, I played a lot of Pokémon GO, as I've talked about earlier.

766
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:10,560
Continuing to play the Final Fantasy XII HD remaster, um, I've now passed the point

767
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:14,040
in this one than I did when I originally played the game on PlayStation 2, so that's really

768
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,040
cool.

769
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:18,320
Um, so I've been playing more of that and I love the remaster.

770
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:23,080
Unfortunately, I keep getting distracted by groups for Final Fantasy XIV, because I'm

771
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,320
still trying to run my characters in that.

772
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,320
I got it.

773
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:29,320
This is a story that we didn't, I don't think it was in our show role, but I saw this somewhere

774
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:30,360
because they were complaining about it.

775
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,360
I haven't read on it.

776
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,360
Okay.

777
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,360
Oh, is it?

778
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,360
I'm sorry.

779
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:35,360
It was in other territories is what it was.

780
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:41,120
They had raised the cost, the monthly fee for other territories outside of the US to

781
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,760
get in line.

782
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:47,240
So like in other areas, like it was equivalent of like $45 a month.

783
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:48,240
Wow.

784
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,240
Yeah.

785
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,240
It's ridiculous.

786
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,240
That's weird.

787
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,240
For Final Fantasy XIV?

788
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,240
Well, yeah.

789
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:56,520
It's for like other territories that don't like, economically, they're not up to our

790
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:57,520
level.

791
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:58,520
Okay.

792
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:00,120
So like that was like, you know, quite a bit of money.

793
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,120
Interesting.

794
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,800
But I'd like to know what is World of Warcraft costs in those countries?

795
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,240
Is that a competitive price?

796
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:06,240
I don't know.

797
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,240
Yeah.

798
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,240
Who knows?

799
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,240
Interesting.

800
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:13,160
Well, anyway, here, the game's still running great and I'm having a good time.

801
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:16,080
They did a little patch this week.

802
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:19,240
They put out the raids not that long ago and now you can get the more advanced tomes.

803
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,240
There's more stuff to explore.

804
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,240
So I've been doing that.

805
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:25,060
I think I did a live stream earlier this week of Final Fantasy XIV.

806
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:28,440
And then this weekend I've been playing a bit of Splatoon 2 just came out.

807
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:32,160
So I did pick up Splatoon 2 on the Switch and I've been playing that.

808
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:38,120
And I'm, you know, it is, there are a lot of similarities to Splatoon 1, obviously.

809
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:42,740
The multiplayer feels very, very similar, but Splatoon 1's multiplayer wasn't exactly

810
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:45,300
broken in the formula of how the game works.

811
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:46,600
So they didn't change a lot.

812
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:47,960
So I think that's good.

813
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:53,880
I do love it on the Switch because of the fact that you can do the portable as well.

814
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:57,520
So I can kind of play it while I'm in bed and do the multiplayer, you know, stuff that

815
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:58,520
way.

816
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:03,720
Or, you know, I can play it on the TV and I can use, you know, the dog ear controller

817
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:04,720
if I want.

818
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:09,280
I've been trying to force myself to learn motion controls, but one thing I'm finding

819
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:14,120
is that I just can't do it if I'm playing a paint roller, which I tend to do in multiplayer

820
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,120
mode.

821
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:17,920
Like I just don't see how motion control benefits the paint roller thing.

822
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:21,480
Somebody was trying to tell me, oh, well for the splashing and that it was like, I can't

823
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,480
do it.

824
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,920
It just, it throws me off so much.

825
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:28,760
And I was enjoying, like, there's like a gun that kind of like, it fires a lot of paint

826
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:29,880
in a straight line.

827
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:32,320
It's supposed to be like a sniper rifle basically.

828
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:35,480
So I was, I was really enjoying like how that weapon was functioning.

829
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,220
So I was like trying to play with it.

830
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:42,820
And I did find that using motion controls for that is a little more like mouse.

831
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:47,800
It feels, you know, it feels a lot better than say like the, even, you know, the Wii

832
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:51,160
U or the Wii or whatever, because obviously motion controls have progressed a lot now

833
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:52,560
that we're here on the Switch.

834
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:58,400
So the motion controls, like they feel nice, but yet my scores in those matches were atrocious.

835
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:02,560
So I must not know what the fuck I'm doing with the sniper rifle, but like, I'm trying

836
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:06,320
to learn the motion control, but when I play single, single player mode, I'm kind of like

837
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:10,520
forcing myself to use motion control and I'm, I'm, I'm doing okay.

838
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:14,040
So you know, it has a lot of the same stuff from Splatoon 1, but it's just different now

839
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,180
because they have a new single player mode.

840
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:19,640
There is a co-op mode, but admittedly I've done nothing other than the tutorial.

841
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,400
So I don't have a lot to say about that yet.

842
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,760
I've just been trying to focus on the multiplayer when I have been playing it.

843
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:27,800
I've been losing a lot of matches, but I've been winning a few.

844
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:32,520
So I do feel like the game might be waiting because I noticed there's this little icon

845
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:36,920
where this number changes and I'm like, is that like my streak balance or something where

846
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:39,600
like if I'm winning a lot of matches, it's going to give me harder opponents.

847
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,720
If I'm losing a lot, it's going to give me easier ones.

848
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:45,960
I think that might be what it's doing because it does feel like I don't lose a lot in a

849
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:47,720
row until I finally win one.

850
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:51,360
So, you know, props to the matchmaking in that regard.

851
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:55,320
I know it's coming up later in the show about Nintendo's whole app and all that stuff.

852
00:46:55,320 --> 00:47:00,520
Admittedly, I haven't even tried the online, like trying to find to play with a friend

853
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:03,920
or I haven't even done, I haven't touched it because everybody and everything on the

854
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,360
internet is just, it's garbage.

855
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:08,960
So I'm like, I'm not going to touch it yet.

856
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:14,200
Anyway, is there other ways to like, you know, set up games without the app?

857
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:15,040
Yeah, oh yeah.

858
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,320
You could just go into join a friend in progress.

859
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:20,920
And I think some people did that for me because I saw a Twitter handle that follows me on

860
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,880
Twitter and I was like, I think that person's a Twitter, but I don't know because the game

861
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:28,720
doesn't tell you, oh, this is your friend or you know, whatever.

862
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:33,800
It doesn't tell you anything about who's joining your match or when or guaranteeing putting

863
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,760
you on the same team or anything like that.

864
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:39,520
Anyway, I do plan to do Splatoon 2 after the show tonight.

865
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:44,600
So maybe I'll learn a little bit more about the multiplayer then, but it definitely is

866
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:47,300
not, it's not Overwatch.

867
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:48,560
Let's put it that way.

868
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:53,520
It is not the matchmaking capabilities of a game like Overwatch or Call of Duty or one

869
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:54,520
of those things.

870
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:57,960
And I think we all know that based on what we're hearing of the app, which we'll hear

871
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:00,200
a little more about later on in the show.

872
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:05,840
But I've just accepted the fact that I'm playing mostly with randoms and it's fine.

873
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:10,200
But like, you know, if somebody joins my game and it says, let's say, cause the name that

874
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,760
shows up is just the name you play with on the Wii.

875
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:15,840
So let's say somebody joins my game and it's Shane.

876
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:19,640
Is it the Shane I know from Ranger Pride that comes on this show occasionally?

877
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:23,200
Or is it just some other guy that happens to be named Shane?

878
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,200
I don't know.

879
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:25,720
Cause the game doesn't tell me.

880
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:30,240
So there's just, there's a lot of weird shit when it comes to the online support that I

881
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,200
feel like they still have to figure out.

882
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:35,720
And I feel like maybe the team has one vision, but then it's like Nintendo's infrastructure

883
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:37,320
might limit them on some things.

884
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:42,720
So I'm hoping through patches, they're able to make some more of this make sense.

885
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:47,200
As far as the game itself, I'm fine.

886
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:51,640
Like, you know, I feel like I might even be having a little more fun with it this time

887
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:54,760
than I was when I first played it on Wii U, just because I feel like I understand the

888
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:58,480
game a little better just from watching other people play it and live streams and stuff.

889
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,760
So I mean, you know, that part's cool.

890
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:05,000
I do feel like when I do the paint roller, I am learning how to do things like how to

891
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,680
sneak up on people.

892
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:11,120
Like you know, I got an ability that makes, when I swim, I'm more like a Ninja.

893
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:12,640
I'm a lot harder to spot.

894
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:16,480
So I'm getting really good at swimming up behind people and splat them with the roller.

895
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:17,800
So like, I'm learning little tricks like that.

896
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:20,560
And that does feel really good that like, oh, I'm progressing this time.

897
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:21,640
That's nice.

898
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:23,600
So there you go.

899
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:29,040
Anyway, let's see, I'm trying to look in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

900
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,960
It sounds like ActDeft had some real issues getting the game.

901
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:34,320
I guess Amazon strikes again.

902
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:37,120
ActDeft says I'll have to wait until Tuesday.

903
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:41,640
And that's because, oh, it's UPS or USPS's fault, which I think are the vendors that

904
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:45,880
Amazon uses, question mark, anyway.

905
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:51,400
Let's see, other comments in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

906
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:58,320
Let's see, yeah, oh no, ActDeft is definitely blaming Amazon as I scroll up there.

907
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:59,320
What's happening there?

908
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:02,800
I don't see a lot of other people that have been playing Splatoon commenting on that.

909
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,280
But maybe we'll get some more there.

910
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:08,520
So yeah, again, I've been enjoying the game.

911
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:13,920
I will probably enjoy it more when they can make the friends and joining people seamless.

912
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:18,040
And this whole fact that co-op mode is only available some of the time, which is so fucking

913
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,040
weird to me.

914
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:23,400
Yeah, I saw your post and I was like, so it's like up for 24 hours and then down for 24

915
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:24,400
hours?

916
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:25,760
Well, that's what I heard it was supposed to be.

917
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:29,960
But then this weekend, it's been mostly up, except it will be down for random ass two

918
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:30,960
hour periods.

919
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:35,320
Like it does, it just, it doesn't make sense.

920
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:38,880
Like a lot of Nintendo online things, it doesn't make sense.

921
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:44,160
And this continues the trend, which is unfortunate because the game is a lot of fun when you

922
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,480
know you can play it.

923
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:49,560
So anyway, all right, let's move on.

924
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:52,800
I want to get into some gaming news because I know we're going to talk about this Nintendo

925
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,840
online thing in a little bit.

926
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:56,360
Just some quick announcements.

927
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:59,120
First off, we will not be here over Labor Day weekend.

928
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:01,280
I will be in Atlanta at Dragon Con.

929
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:06,560
So if you are in the Southeast area, anywhere near Atlanta, you should come to Dragon Con

930
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:07,840
and have fun.

931
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:08,840
Party with us.

932
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:11,840
I should know a little more about panels, appearances, things like that a little closer

933
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:13,040
to the show.

934
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,760
So I'll be plugging those again.

935
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,280
You can find me at Dragon Con.

936
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,280
I'll be there.

937
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:19,280
Bobby Blackolf would be there.

938
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,840
I think John from Critical Myth is there.

939
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,520
I know some other folks from VOG Network.

940
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:24,920
I don't know the full roll call, but I know some other folks will be there too.

941
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:25,920
So it'll be a lot of fun.

942
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:31,320
All right, let's get into some gaming news for tonight's Loki starting us off.

943
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:35,400
So in like, I will never ask for this news.

944
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:39,160
Atari has announced that they're releasing a new console.

945
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:41,440
The Atari box.

946
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:45,160
It's a PC based system that's going to play old and current games.

947
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:46,760
They haven't announced the price point.

948
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:50,240
They've released a picture though that looks kind of neat, like the faux wood green on

949
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:53,240
the front there and the glowing Atari logo.

950
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:57,360
And then they also have one I think that resembles the 7800 maybe?

951
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:01,600
With the red logo in all black.

952
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:06,120
So that's literally all we know about it right now, other than I guess they said they're

953
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:11,600
going to be funding the console via crowdfunding, hooray!

954
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:14,360
And we'll be listening closely to community feedback.

955
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:24,520
Although it reminds me so much of like the Coleco chameleon, you know?

956
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:25,520
Yeah.

957
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:30,600
I don't think you're supposed to put water in that.

958
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:38,080
I think that the crowdsourcing on there is probably more of a desperate attempt for them

959
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:42,160
to try to make sure they can get the money on it.

960
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:47,040
But I don't get why.

961
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,960
I looked at it and I just was like, why?

962
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:52,800
Well, I mean it depends.

963
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:55,240
Some of Atari's games are interesting.

964
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:56,840
I don't know.

965
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:01,920
They've had so many Atari consoles come out, like the whole flashback consoles.

966
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:07,120
I don't know if I'd really want to play more like 2600 games or anything like that.

967
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:13,600
But I'd be interested to see like, you know, other Atari games that like maybe Hellesu

968
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:14,600
Arcade.

969
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:19,880
Imagine like arcade titles, like if they had like good emulation of arcade titles like

970
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:22,360
San Francisco Rush.

971
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:26,280
But I think that their whole thing that they're going for is the classic Atari.

972
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:28,680
Well everything's classic now for Atari.

973
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:35,280
I mean the real classic Atari, the 2600, the 5200, and the 7800.

974
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:36,280
I don't know.

975
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:39,680
I hope that there's more to it than just that because I don't see why I would need to get

976
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,640
a console for that.

977
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:42,640
Okay, sorry guys.

978
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:46,000
Loki made the offhanded comment about the water because I just spilled water all over

979
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
the keyboard.

980
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,160
So I'm going to pray that I still have a working keyboard or trying to finish tonight's show.

981
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,040
It's going to be interesting.

982
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:55,160
But in the meantime, that's why I got real quiet there for a minute.

983
00:53:55,160 --> 00:54:00,000
It might understand that this thing is like if the Ouya and an Atari flashback console

984
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
had a baby.

985
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Is that basically what this is?

986
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,800
Well, as far as we know right now, because all we know is that it's a box and that it's

987
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:07,920
going to have some sort of components inside of it.

988
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:11,560
As far as what it's going to do and how powerful it is and how much it costs and how they're

989
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:14,480
going to fund it and how can I buy one.

990
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:15,920
We don't know any of that.

991
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:23,080
But now am I wrong in thinking they just announced the Atari flashback eight, seven or eight

992
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:24,080
if I'm not...

993
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:25,080
Eight.

994
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:26,080
Yeah.

995
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:27,080
They just announced that either this week.

996
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:30,200
I don't know if somebody else holds the license for that or what have you, but I know they're

997
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,920
getting Activision games this time.

998
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,360
Yeah, Activision games and HDMI out.

999
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:35,680
It's going to do 720p.

1000
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:40,640
So honestly, right now I'm more jazzed about that flashback console because it's going

1001
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:44,760
to have kaboom capers and pitfall and some of the Activision classics.

1002
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:47,440
I don't know that I would want to play them in 1080p.

1003
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:50,760
So when I say kaboom, I ran two games together.

1004
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:53,280
Kaboom and Keystone capers are going to be in there anyway.

1005
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,680
I don't know that I would want to play them in 1080p because I'll be honest when we do

1006
00:54:56,680 --> 00:55:02,240
Atari party, we have ours hooked up to some pretty nice high res monitors and it just

1007
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:03,240
doesn't look the same.

1008
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:04,360
I like my flicker.

1009
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:05,360
It's all good.

1010
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:12,000
It'll just be one like fuzzy mess, but that's what, I mean, to be fair, I mean, most people

1011
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,120
that buy these flashback consoles, aren't, uh, I don't know what the word would be classic

1012
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:22,920
gaming purists, I guess for lack of a better term, um, that, well, the reality is most

1013
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:26,080
people don't have those TVs anymore.

1014
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:29,400
So if they're going to buy a console like this, they have to have HDMI, right?

1015
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:31,740
Even though it might not look quite right.

1016
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:36,440
But anyway, my point is as, as cool as these Atari flashback console sound, it sounds like

1017
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:42,380
this thing that's coming out is just one of those mashed with some type of open-ended

1018
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:43,380
question mark.

1019
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:48,060
I mean, I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt until if it's crowdfunded, if

1020
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:50,700
it's crowdfunded, I'm not, well, right.

1021
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:52,300
I who said I'm going to back it.

1022
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:54,300
I'm not backing that shit.

1023
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:56,820
I mean, I'm just curious to see what it is.

1024
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:57,940
Like I'm not pulling it.

1025
00:55:57,940 --> 00:56:00,060
I learned my lesson with OUYA.

1026
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:01,540
That's enough.

1027
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:02,540
Don't get me wrong.

1028
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:03,540
That shell looks awesome.

1029
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:08,220
Like if anything, the very least, I'd love one of those, you know, Atari, the Atari box

1030
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:12,420
with the wood grain on the front as a shell for like a raspberry pie or something like

1031
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:13,420
that.

1032
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:14,460
Cause that shit looks nice.

1033
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:17,220
But I mean, other than that, yeah, who knows?

1034
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:18,220
I don't know.

1035
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:22,060
It'd be interesting to see, and it's kind of just out of nowhere.

1036
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:23,060
It's like, okay.

1037
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:24,060
It was very random.

1038
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:25,060
Right.

1039
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:27,060
Um, you know, it's got SD card support as well.

1040
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:29,820
I don't know.

1041
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:33,940
Going to live.vognetwork.com, Hitstun says, wait, we know what's, we know what's in the

1042
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:34,940
Atari box.

1043
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:36,460
I was hoping for Jaguar games.

1044
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:39,140
Uh, well they haven't ruled it out.

1045
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:44,020
So tempest 2000 could still be a reality, but don't count on it.

1046
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:46,300
I just hope it's not their new new Atari games.

1047
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:48,620
Cause apparently their new new Atari games are really shit.

1048
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:54,180
Like there was a roller coaster tycoon world apparently not so good.

1049
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:58,900
And the last alone, the dark game that they put out was shit.

1050
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:02,260
Doomplague in chat says we're talking about a company that filed bankruptcy and sold all

1051
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:06,500
of its modern franchises, then said they would focus on casino games.

1052
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:11,380
Uh, dungeon buster says, I'm curious to see what it is, but my expectations are set way

1053
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:12,860
low for this thing.

1054
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:16,620
Uh, and that's probably the boat I'm in is I'm like, Ooh, I kind of want to get where

1055
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:21,420
those Atari flashback consoles, Atari box crowdfunding.

1056
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:22,860
Good luck guys.

1057
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:26,060
We'll see when you get all the details at the very least, you know, one of those is

1058
00:57:26,060 --> 00:57:27,060
going to come out.

1059
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:28,660
The other one on the other hand, you have no idea.

1060
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:32,820
Cause they could, they say, Oh yeah, we're going to release this, it's grand crowdfunded

1061
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:35,420
and no one gives a shit and then it doesn't get crowdfunded.

1062
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:36,420
All right.

1063
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:39,780
Well, another thing that's been going on this weekend is San Diego comic con.

1064
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:42,900
And I know a lot of you guys been watching for what's been coming out of that because

1065
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:47,340
there's, you know, there's always some announcements and things that can directly affect video

1066
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:48,340
games.

1067
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:52,060
For example, more characters being announced for Marvel versus Capcom infinite.

1068
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:58,420
Uh, some of the confirmations we got at, uh, uh, San Diego comic con include, uh, Frank

1069
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:02,300
West, Mike Hagar and nemesis.

1070
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:05,700
So we got to see some of those, uh, uh, in the game.

1071
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:06,700
And that's pretty cool.

1072
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:10,740
Cause obviously Frank West from dead rising, very popular character, Mike Hagar final fight.

1073
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:14,220
So, you know, uh, some good Capcom stars to be in that game.

1074
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:19,100
Uh, which I think even though a lot of people are kind of like, I don't know, they're all

1075
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:21,420
in the roster that leaked out a while ago.

1076
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:25,820
So, uh, but dark soccer, you, you still want to give this game a chance, right?

1077
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:26,820
Yeah.

1078
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:27,820
We'll see.

1079
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:28,820
I do.

1080
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:33,460
Do you look, will you be playing as Frank West or Mike Hagar nemesis?

1081
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:34,460
We'll see.

1082
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:35,460
We'll see.

1083
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:37,800
Uh, Oh, here's a, okay.

1084
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:41,580
So they released this on, uh, mobile phones this week.

1085
00:58:41,580 --> 00:58:45,000
It is a crossover between hello kitty and Pac-Man.

1086
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
That's right.

1087
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
It's hello kitty and Pac-Man.

1088
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:51,440
Uh, and uh, it's in the regular Pac-Man mobile game, which is available on the Google play

1089
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:53,280
store in the Apple app store.

1090
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:57,280
And uh, what they did at comic con though is that there's actually crossover themed

1091
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:58,680
merchandise.

1092
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:04,040
And that part might be really cool, but let me tell you this, uh, Alan saw the thing about

1093
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,560
hello kitty and Pac-Man and said, Oh Rob, you got to download the game.

1094
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:12,000
So I did fucking garbage.

1095
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,600
And I like a lot of retro stuff and I like Pac-Man.

1096
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:18,000
I fucking have streamed championship edition two.

1097
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:24,240
I think championship edition DX is great mobile phone game ass.

1098
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:25,960
Like it's just, it's not good guys.

1099
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:26,960
It's not good.

1100
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:27,960
I'm sorry.

1101
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:28,960
There's no nice way for me to put it.

1102
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:30,480
It just doesn't translate well to a mobile phone.

1103
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:34,320
Again, the lack of a tactile controller does not do it any favors.

1104
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:39,800
And these whole, like, it's a freemium game where you have to either buy the coins or

1105
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:44,640
earn the coins in these really basic mazes or just, it's just, it's silly.

1106
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:47,360
They just do look kind of cute though.

1107
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:48,360
That's not it.

1108
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:49,360
Hard pass.

1109
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:50,560
All right.

1110
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:54,640
But something that I'm really curious to see if Loki is going to give a hard pass or a,

1111
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:59,200
uh, I'm going out to get in line right now is of course a lot of gamers are taking great

1112
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:02,960
interest in the upcoming movie for ready player one.

1113
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:09,480
And as Loki was hoping, the first teaser was indeed released at San Diego comic con and

1114
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:12,800
Loki I'm dying to know what you think.

1115
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:13,880
It was fucking awesome.

1116
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:14,880
Yeah.

1117
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:18,760
Like it's, it's seriously, I've watched that trailer like 75 times already.

1118
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:19,760
75 times?

1119
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:20,760
Yeah.

1120
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:23,800
It's, it's, it's so like, don't get me wrong.

1121
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:28,760
Like my wife read the book as well and she said it was just garbage.

1122
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:35,280
I mean it is a lot of it's just like listing off shit from the eighties.

1123
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:36,280
That's fine.

1124
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:40,300
But along with that, if you just ignore the bad writing, because a lot of people ignore

1125
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:43,480
bad writing and both like the 50 shades of gray fucking twilight.

1126
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:44,480
Yeah.

1127
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:45,480
Yeah.

1128
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:46,480
You know all that shit.

1129
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:47,480
So they ignore the Harry Potter.

1130
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:48,480
Just kidding.

1131
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:49,480
Just kidding.

1132
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:51,200
We're not seeing, this is like fucking literally, this isn't like a literary masterpiece or

1133
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:52,200
anything like that.

1134
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:53,480
I'm not going to fucking say that at all.

1135
01:00:53,480 --> 01:01:00,720
It's it's schlock, but it's got some awesome, you know, the story's pretty cool.

1136
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:04,600
And like the set pieces and like action that are described in there, it's just fucking

1137
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:05,600
amazing.

1138
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:09,000
Like you read that and you're like, there's no way they can make this into a movie because

1139
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,320
it'd be fucking expensive with all the licensing they would have to do.

1140
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:16,720
And just looking at the trailer, cause a lot of this stuff in the trailer, like half the

1141
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,660
trailer is not in the book.

1142
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:20,880
The whole racing thing is not part of the book.

1143
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:21,880
It's new.

1144
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:27,920
Um, so it's good that they're deviating from that, but it looks so fucking cool.

1145
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:32,700
I even, I noticed I was just like, it's so goddamn awesome.

1146
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:34,000
Like a big CG Fest.

1147
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,000
I don't care.

1148
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,960
I'm in, it's, it's in the future.

1149
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:41,340
I guess CG Fest is a lot, but even I noticed, I was like, is that Freddy Krueger?

1150
01:01:41,340 --> 01:01:42,740
Is that the Iron Giant?

1151
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:44,860
Like what the fuck?

1152
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:49,700
Fucking Freddy Krueger, the Iron Giant, they had Duke Nukem in there at one point, Deathstroke,

1153
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:54,740
Harley Quinn, you know, um, I mean there's like tons of references to all sorts of stuff.

1154
01:01:54,740 --> 01:01:57,080
If it's in a Warner Brothers movie, it's probably in here somewhere.

1155
01:01:57,080 --> 01:02:00,700
And even like something that's, you know, maybe not Warner Brothers as well.

1156
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:03,840
I mean, so it, it looks really awesome.

1157
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:11,020
So I'm very down to see what this is going to be like and yeah, I'll be there day one.

1158
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:12,020
Absolutely.

1159
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:15,580
I mean, it's just, and then also like the, like the musical tones with it.

1160
01:02:15,580 --> 01:02:18,620
I mean, it's just like, so I did enjoy the rush.

1161
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:19,620
See, I watched the trailer.

1162
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:21,620
I don't know shit about the book other than Loki's.

1163
01:02:21,620 --> 01:02:22,620
You gotta read the book.

1164
01:02:22,620 --> 01:02:23,620
I have the book.

1165
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:24,620
You can read the book.

1166
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:26,980
Uh, Loki's always very excited about it.

1167
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:29,340
Uh, here's, here's just a plot twist.

1168
01:02:29,340 --> 01:02:33,940
It'll have a lot more chance of actually getting read if I get an audio book just because for

1169
01:02:33,940 --> 01:02:35,140
commutes and things like that.

1170
01:02:35,140 --> 01:02:37,660
Like I just, the audio book is narrated by Wil Wheaton.

1171
01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:38,660
So that's cool.

1172
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:39,660
All right.

1173
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:44,420
Uh, even I noticed with the trailer, I was like, all right, this looks like it could

1174
01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:45,700
be, I don't read books.

1175
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:46,700
Okay.

1176
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:49,100
I don't like reading books, but this book, I couldn't put it down.

1177
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:51,540
Um, I noticed rush was in the trailer.

1178
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:57,740
That's a big part of in, in, in the, the spoiler for the book, I guess in the book, there's

1179
01:02:57,740 --> 01:03:03,700
a guitar hero type thing that he has to do that he has to play Tom Sawyer, I think, or

1180
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:04,700
I think that's what it was.

1181
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:07,380
I, yeah, it's been a while since I read the book, but which I think that song was actually

1182
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:08,380
in guitar heroes.

1183
01:03:08,420 --> 01:03:10,860
I think he has to play that song or something like rock.

1184
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:13,100
He has to do a guitar hero type thing in there.

1185
01:03:13,100 --> 01:03:19,020
But um, yeah, I mean it, it definitely, it's all the, um, the people that were in the race

1186
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:23,260
or they call them the Sixers, they're part of this, um, internet company that's evil

1187
01:03:23,260 --> 01:03:24,740
and shit.

1188
01:03:24,740 --> 01:03:28,740
And so of course they're out to find, you know, the hidden Easter egg as well.

1189
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:32,240
So I mean they, they're using the power of money to be able to do all that.

1190
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:35,940
But yeah, I mean it's got like, you know, Artemis, one of the characters in the book,

1191
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:42,380
she's got a, um, a cross between Canada's bike from Akira and I'll Tron light cycle

1192
01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:48,020
and, you know, and of course, um, the main character, Wade, he's got, it's supposed to

1193
01:03:48,020 --> 01:03:53,620
be a cross between the Ecto one, the, uh, back to the future DeLorean and the Knight

1194
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:56,540
Rider, um, kit car.

1195
01:03:56,540 --> 01:04:00,340
This sounds like internet fanfic gone crazy.

1196
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:03,420
Come on, Noel, Gus and chat says, Loki's body is ready.

1197
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:05,140
Oh yeah, I'm, I wasn't ready.

1198
01:04:05,140 --> 01:04:08,780
I've been waiting for this trailer and I, I was like, I was checking the internet and

1199
01:04:08,780 --> 01:04:11,380
checking Twitter and shit like all day long on Saturday.

1200
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:12,500
I'm like, okay, when's this thing?

1201
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:13,500
When is it?

1202
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:14,500
When is it?

1203
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:15,500
And I saw it.

1204
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:16,500
I'm like, fuck yes.

1205
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:17,500
I'm watching that.

1206
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:18,860
And I was at depth and chat says, can you really tell what the story's about with that

1207
01:04:18,860 --> 01:04:19,860
trailer?

1208
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:22,820
Well, it, to be fair, it's a teaser, not a trailer, but it's a teaser.

1209
01:04:22,820 --> 01:04:27,460
It's still, I mean, um, no, probably not from that.

1210
01:04:27,460 --> 01:04:30,820
They didn't really explain what it was if it was just a teaser.

1211
01:04:30,820 --> 01:04:34,260
But I mean, being that I've read the book, I know what the story's about.

1212
01:04:34,580 --> 01:04:39,140
Um, did you see now just quickly, some of the other stuff like Dar Sakra, I know, uh,

1213
01:04:39,140 --> 01:04:40,380
aren't you a fan of Ms. Marvel?

1214
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:42,420
Didn't we get the first look at her today or yesterday?

1215
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:43,420
I hadn't looked yet.

1216
01:04:43,420 --> 01:04:45,900
Oh, you should look, let me know what you think.

1217
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:47,540
I'd be curious.

1218
01:04:47,540 --> 01:04:53,660
I watched, um, a few of the other trailers, but I didn't really watch very many.

1219
01:04:53,660 --> 01:04:56,740
I'm kind of waiting for the hype to die down and then I'll make my own decision.

1220
01:04:56,740 --> 01:04:59,520
I just so rarely get out to movies anymore.

1221
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:00,700
It's just a bummer.

1222
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:02,900
I need to see more, but I just never do.

1223
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:03,900
Oh, well.

1224
01:05:03,940 --> 01:05:05,580
I did watch an odd trailer.

1225
01:05:05,580 --> 01:05:06,580
What'd you see?

1226
01:05:06,580 --> 01:05:11,020
For, I don't even know if the movie's already out or not, but it's called Cooties.

1227
01:05:11,020 --> 01:05:14,420
I really liked the trailer for what's the Oprah movie.

1228
01:05:14,420 --> 01:05:15,420
The Oprah-

1229
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:16,420
Oh, Wrinkle in Time.

1230
01:05:16,420 --> 01:05:17,420
Yes, the Wrinkle in Time.

1231
01:05:17,420 --> 01:05:18,420
The Oprah movie.

1232
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:19,420
Oprah's in it.

1233
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:23,780
And it had the Eurythmics cover in the trailer that I actually, I had to go find it on Spotify

1234
01:05:23,780 --> 01:05:24,780
because I was like, all right.

1235
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:25,780
I couldn't find it.

1236
01:05:25,780 --> 01:05:26,780
I tried.

1237
01:05:26,780 --> 01:05:29,060
It is, it is on the soundtrack to the movie Sucker Punch, believe it or not.

1238
01:05:29,060 --> 01:05:30,060
It's a different one.

1239
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:32,140
The one that they have in that trailer is not the same.

1240
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:34,260
Everyone says it is that one, but it's different.

1241
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:35,260
Oh, I thought it was the-

1242
01:05:35,260 --> 01:05:36,660
No, I've listened to both of them.

1243
01:05:36,660 --> 01:05:37,780
It's a completely different-

1244
01:05:37,780 --> 01:05:40,060
Maybe she remade it again.

1245
01:05:40,060 --> 01:05:41,060
It's different.

1246
01:05:41,060 --> 01:05:42,060
Yeah.

1247
01:05:42,060 --> 01:05:43,060
Interesting.

1248
01:05:43,060 --> 01:05:44,060
But this Cooties movie is weird.

1249
01:05:44,060 --> 01:05:49,500
It has Elijah Wood in it and it's about child zombies that apparently-

1250
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:51,060
Not another zombie movie.

1251
01:05:51,060 --> 01:05:55,420
They're apparently only susceptible to whatever it is if you haven't gone through puberty.

1252
01:05:55,420 --> 01:05:56,420
Oh, my bad.

1253
01:05:56,420 --> 01:05:57,420
That's right.

1254
01:05:57,420 --> 01:05:58,420
Act F says it was D23.

1255
01:05:58,420 --> 01:05:59,420
Sorry, that was last week's news.

1256
01:05:59,420 --> 01:06:00,420
My bad.

1257
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:01,420
My bad.

1258
01:06:01,420 --> 01:06:02,420
We'll allow it.

1259
01:06:02,420 --> 01:06:03,420
We'll allow it.

1260
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:04,420
We'll allow it.

1261
01:06:04,420 --> 01:06:05,420
We'll allow it.

1262
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:06,420
Blow us together.

1263
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:07,420
All right.

1264
01:06:07,420 --> 01:06:08,420
I did watch all the Marvel trailers and I watched the DC trailers as well.

1265
01:06:08,420 --> 01:06:09,420
I'm still not hyped about Justice League.

1266
01:06:09,420 --> 01:06:10,420
I'm sorry.

1267
01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:14,740
I'm just, maybe I'm not, well, I am not a DC fan, but like, but you know what, though?

1268
01:06:14,740 --> 01:06:19,180
If they're smart and when Joss Whedon took over, he just made it Wonder Woman too, but

1269
01:06:19,180 --> 01:06:20,180
we'll see.

1270
01:06:20,180 --> 01:06:23,180
No, Wonder Woman had a great part in it and that stuff looked neat.

1271
01:06:23,180 --> 01:06:26,700
It's just, I'm not still just on board with like, it wasn't the same as like the Avengers

1272
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:27,700
like this.

1273
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:29,300
I'm just like, I don't fucking care.

1274
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:30,600
It's kind of what it is.

1275
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:34,760
But like, holy shit, the Lego movies though, they're fucking knocking that shit out of

1276
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:38,200
the park because they had a new trailer for the Ninjago movie.

1277
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:39,200
Fucking hilarious.

1278
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:43,720
Just the humor that they have in those movies, they're just fantastic.

1279
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:44,720
So they have that.

1280
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:48,480
And of course the new Thor Ragnarok trailer looks awesome.

1281
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:55,220
And then I watched the bootleg of the Avengers infinity war trailer, which looks pretty cool.

1282
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:56,220
Hope they release that adventure.

1283
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:57,540
I don't know why they do that.

1284
01:06:57,540 --> 01:06:58,540
Like hold it back.

1285
01:06:58,540 --> 01:07:04,060
They're waiting for Thor Ragnarok to come out or some weird, but, um, yeah, it all looks

1286
01:07:04,060 --> 01:07:05,060
good.

1287
01:07:05,060 --> 01:07:07,580
Um, trying to win else defenders though.

1288
01:07:07,580 --> 01:07:08,580
That's another one too.

1289
01:07:08,580 --> 01:07:12,620
I don't give a shit about like, I didn't, I've never gotten into the Netflix stuff,

1290
01:07:12,620 --> 01:07:15,280
but I'm just like, yeah, I really don't want to see that.

1291
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:18,780
But stranger things too is, I'm on board for that.

1292
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:20,260
I was already on board for that.

1293
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:24,000
So, all right, well we could talk about more movies and TVs, but we need to get back to

1294
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,000
games.

1295
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,140
Uh, dark soccer has some shakeup and gaming, right?

1296
01:07:27,140 --> 01:07:28,140
Yep.

1297
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:33,380
And I'm honestly not terribly surprised by it, but, um, BioWare's, uh, general manager,

1298
01:07:33,380 --> 01:07:38,420
Aaron Flynn, who's been there for 17 years is leaving.

1299
01:07:38,420 --> 01:07:45,840
And to replace him is another former BioWare employee who went off to Microsoft and is

1300
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:54,000
now coming back, uh, Casey Hudson, which basically it was Hudson's interest in returning that

1301
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,820
led to Flynn making the final decision.

1302
01:07:55,820 --> 01:08:00,840
Of course, that's what it says, but you know, everybody's reading into this.

1303
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:05,360
Was Mass Effect Andromeda that bad?

1304
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:07,900
Perhaps that unsupported.

1305
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:14,120
And if it were me on a project that, you know, that I had hoped would be treated better,

1306
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:17,660
I'd probably leave too, cause you know, that's just gotta be a blow.

1307
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:23,920
I mean, this guy was also, uh, if I'm right, like the lead programmer for Dragon Age Origins

1308
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:24,920
and Mass Effect 2.

1309
01:08:25,020 --> 01:08:27,340
No, he was the director of programming.

1310
01:08:27,340 --> 01:08:34,420
So, you know, two series, you know, and he was also a general manager, of course, while

1311
01:08:34,420 --> 01:08:36,940
Dragon Age Inquisition was going on in Mass Effect 3.

1312
01:08:36,940 --> 01:08:42,440
So I mean, he's had his fingers in the pie for a long time.

1313
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:46,700
Dungeon Buster in chat says, as one comment I read about on the BioWare news went, someone

1314
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:48,380
had to fall on their sword.

1315
01:08:48,380 --> 01:08:49,380
Okay.

1316
01:08:49,380 --> 01:08:50,380
But here's my question.

1317
01:08:50,380 --> 01:08:52,660
Who at EA is taking a hit?

1318
01:08:52,660 --> 01:08:57,840
Because I'm sorry, EA needs blame in that what happened with Andromeda needs some big

1319
01:08:57,840 --> 01:09:01,840
time blame, but that's, that's just my thoughts.

1320
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:02,840
Yeah.

1321
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:04,640
It is what it is.

1322
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:05,640
All right.

1323
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:08,880
Well, let's hope the Mass Effect series can maybe recover and maybe with Casey Hudson

1324
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:12,940
at the helm, maybe he's willing to give this series a shot and maybe we'll really advocate

1325
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:13,940
for it.

1326
01:09:13,940 --> 01:09:16,040
Cause it is something he was heavily involved in the original trilogy.

1327
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:17,040
Who knows?

1328
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:18,040
Who knows?

1329
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:19,040
We'll see.

1330
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:20,040
All right.

1331
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:21,040
Well, moving on.

1332
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:22,040
Uh, we got some more news.

1333
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:28,760
So Nintendo released their app, um, just before the launch of Splatoon 2 to basically handle

1334
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:31,700
their online portion of the Switch.

1335
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:35,660
So they have the Nintendo Switch online app and you can use it for a bunch of things for

1336
01:09:35,660 --> 01:09:40,300
Splatoon 2, for example, like, uh, matchmaking, uh, game invites.

1337
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:44,300
They're even having some sort of, uh, voice chat system.

1338
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:51,460
However, the voice chat, of course, as we've seen the setup before with the headsets that

1339
01:09:51,460 --> 01:09:54,840
were coming out is not necessarily the most elegant solution.

1340
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:59,640
You have to basically hook your Switch and your phone up to a splitter and hook that

1341
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:02,680
up to a headset and hope that all works.

1342
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:08,480
On top of that though, their app has some really funky issues with it.

1343
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:15,860
So for example, when you're on voice chat, you'll disconnect if, you know, for example,

1344
01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:20,920
another application comes up or it'll restart in the same room.

1345
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:26,000
If you open, um, I guess it'll restart once you open it up again.

1346
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:30,940
But I guess if it's, the app is in the background, it just disconnects unlike a lot of other

1347
01:10:30,940 --> 01:10:31,940
things.

1348
01:10:31,940 --> 01:10:34,220
The other thing too is the app won't work if your phone goes in the power saving sleep

1349
01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:35,220
mode.

1350
01:10:35,220 --> 01:10:39,140
So if your screen is inactive, it will shut off, which is fantastic because then now you

1351
01:10:39,140 --> 01:10:42,180
have to have your phone charging all the time in order for it to work.

1352
01:10:42,180 --> 01:10:46,220
In my opinion, that is the biggest, dumbest oversight in the whole thing is the fact that

1353
01:10:46,220 --> 01:10:48,500
when you go into sleep mode, the thing kicks you off.

1354
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:54,160
I mean, come on, it's, it's weird.

1355
01:10:54,160 --> 01:11:00,760
I mean, I don't understand why, why they can't just allow it to shut the screen or better

1356
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:04,720
yet, like if you're in chat mode or something like that, have the screen black out.

1357
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:08,760
Like Pokemon go does that where like you can leave your phone open, but if you turn your

1358
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:13,120
phone upside down, it blacks the whole screen and yeah, saves a little power.

1359
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:15,280
Yeah, it's just, it's stupid.

1360
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:21,540
Uh, yeah, and I just, again, the app, I tried using the app at least for some of the other

1361
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:25,220
stuff cause you can go into the splat net or whatever and you can see like, here's my

1362
01:11:25,220 --> 01:11:28,460
last few scores and you can, this is the weird thing.

1363
01:11:28,460 --> 01:11:33,540
You can buy things on the app that are different from the rotations that are in the game live.

1364
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:36,620
So I guess like a little perk to using the app or something.

1365
01:11:36,620 --> 01:11:37,620
I don't know.

1366
01:11:37,620 --> 01:11:41,060
I shouldn't have to, well, shouldn't have to use the app in the first place.

1367
01:11:41,060 --> 01:11:42,740
It's a little weird, but it's there.

1368
01:11:42,740 --> 01:11:49,520
But I mean, other than that stuff, like what is, what is stopping me from using discord

1369
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:50,520
or Skype?

1370
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:51,520
There's really nothing.

1371
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:52,520
It's actually probably better.

1372
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:54,020
Oh my God.

1373
01:11:54,020 --> 01:11:55,640
Discord should be having a field day right now.

1374
01:11:55,640 --> 01:12:00,800
That that system is blowing up, which by the way, cheap plug, vog network discord is also

1375
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:04,360
where actually the next person to join is going to be our 50th member on discord.

1376
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:05,500
So I'm pretty excited about that.

1377
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:08,000
So it's over a vog network.com slash discord.

1378
01:12:08,860 --> 01:12:12,820
But anyway, I mean, discord's really blowing up all over the place.

1379
01:12:12,820 --> 01:12:16,980
And now, you know, now it's going to be a possible solution for a lot of people for

1380
01:12:16,980 --> 01:12:22,200
Nintendo's failure to produce a competent app when it comes to voice chatting, which

1381
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:25,780
I guess, you know, they can always update it and try to make it better, but good Lord.

1382
01:12:25,780 --> 01:12:27,900
Like, okay, I get it.

1383
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:29,140
Here's my, my problem.

1384
01:12:29,140 --> 01:12:34,300
Like I thought the whole idea of having to have an app for online was stupid, but if

1385
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:37,860
they can make it work, then cool.

1386
01:12:37,860 --> 01:12:42,240
And it sounds like they're just, it's like, this is like rookie shit that they're fucking

1387
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:47,400
didn't think, Oh, Hey, maybe we should get it to work when the phone goes to sleep or

1388
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:48,400
have it run in the background.

1389
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:49,400
Or I don't know.

1390
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:52,480
It's like, do they not know how to, do they outsource this shit?

1391
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:55,000
I mean, do they not know how to fix this?

1392
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,520
I mean, I ding, ding, ding.

1393
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:59,880
I think we have a winner, but anyway, I would think that they'd be able to patch this in,

1394
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:03,540
so hopefully they can fix it, but it's just stupid.

1395
01:13:03,540 --> 01:13:09,520
It's not, when people aren't very confident in your ability to handle online and you pull

1396
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:13,720
this shit, it doesn't help the argument for you.

1397
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:18,120
Dungeon buster and chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, Nintendo friend code team.

1398
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:21,160
We made things a little difficult for players to get together.

1399
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:26,200
Nintendo mobile team, hold our beer.

1400
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:27,840
And the friend code thing, let's be honest.

1401
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:29,520
I still don't get that.

1402
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:36,060
I mean, can we get to the point now where we understand that like, there's, is that

1403
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:38,540
really preventing anything with friend codes?

1404
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:43,220
I mean, like I, there's for what it, for what it's worth, which isn't much, but for what

1405
01:13:43,220 --> 01:13:47,260
it's worth, it's not what it used to be in on the Nintendo Wii.

1406
01:13:47,260 --> 01:13:51,020
Like when you find somebody's friend code, you send them a friend request.

1407
01:13:51,020 --> 01:13:53,820
Like it's not one of those, like you both have to add each other or you'll never know

1408
01:13:53,820 --> 01:13:54,820
that.

1409
01:13:54,820 --> 01:14:02,480
It sends a traditional request and you can pull in friends from the Wii U, the 3DS, the

1410
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:05,000
Miitomo and like other mobile stuff.

1411
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:11,360
You can pull in your friends list from those games, but it is weird how the mobile games,

1412
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:15,560
those mobile games like Miitomo will go to your Twitter and Facebook lists, but your

1413
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:17,200
Switch will not.

1414
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:21,240
And I think that just goes to show there's some type of teams not talking to each other

1415
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:23,200
or outsource stuff going on here.

1416
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:25,820
Like why is it possible over here, but not possible over here?

1417
01:14:25,820 --> 01:14:29,060
It's weird, but it's not as bad.

1418
01:14:29,060 --> 01:14:33,500
Like, you know, I know Nintendo gets a lot of shit for friend codes as they should, but

1419
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:35,540
uh, it's not what it was on the Nintendo Wii.

1420
01:14:35,540 --> 01:14:36,540
It's come a long way since then.

1421
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:40,460
I just think people don't care because like you have, once again, parents let their kids

1422
01:14:40,460 --> 01:14:42,300
play fucking Call of Duty and shit.

1423
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:45,300
Do you think they really care who their child is online?

1424
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:46,740
I mean, I don't know.

1425
01:14:46,740 --> 01:14:48,380
Well they, or they should, they should pay attention.

1426
01:14:48,380 --> 01:14:49,380
I don't know.

1427
01:14:49,380 --> 01:14:52,940
Well, anyway, I guess you could always go back to the classic days of the SNES, which

1428
01:14:52,940 --> 01:14:56,480
a lot of people are trying to do because of the Super Nintendo classic.

1429
01:14:56,480 --> 01:15:01,600
And uh, turns out my phone blew up with notifications the other night because Walmart put those

1430
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:02,600
fuckers up for pre-order.

1431
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:07,200
Uh, the Super NES classic supposed to be released on September 29th, it's going to cost 80 bucks

1432
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:11,600
and Walmart put them up for pre-order and of course they're gone.

1433
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:13,200
But I would, I will give them this credit.

1434
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:15,000
It took a good 20 minutes or so.

1435
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:20,800
Yeah, I had set up notifications for that, but I didn't see my phone in time and my phone

1436
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:21,800
was charging.

1437
01:15:21,860 --> 01:15:27,140
I was out at dinner and I know shock and awe you guys, sometimes at dinner, I turn my phone

1438
01:15:27,140 --> 01:15:28,620
over and I don't look at it.

1439
01:15:28,620 --> 01:15:29,620
Sometimes.

1440
01:15:29,620 --> 01:15:30,620
Casp.

1441
01:15:30,620 --> 01:15:31,620
I don't know.

1442
01:15:31,620 --> 01:15:34,440
This was one of those times where I was like, you know, if they're going to make it so difficult

1443
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:37,300
for me to buy one of those systems, I'm just not going to get one.

1444
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:41,100
And that is exactly, if Nintendo wants me to buy one, I will.

1445
01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:42,820
And I said that a few weeks ago and I'm sticking to it.

1446
01:15:42,820 --> 01:15:48,340
Cause honestly this, this product to me seems like, like the, um, you know, Atari flashbacks

1447
01:15:48,340 --> 01:15:50,040
and new stuff of that sort.

1448
01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:51,900
It's more of like an impulse buy.

1449
01:15:51,900 --> 01:15:55,780
I think, I mean, a lot of people really want it, but I think, you know, if they weren't

1450
01:15:55,780 --> 01:15:59,340
so hard to get, people wouldn't be clamoring as much.

1451
01:15:59,340 --> 01:16:00,340
I don't know.

1452
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:05,100
Uh, well over at Target, uh, which I didn't really want to buy anything at Walmart anyway.

1453
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:08,940
So when I hear about their competitor Target, I'm like, okay, well target I can handle.

1454
01:16:08,940 --> 01:16:10,780
Uh, somebody actually tweeted target.

1455
01:16:10,780 --> 01:16:13,260
When can I get a SNES classic?

1456
01:16:13,260 --> 01:16:17,480
Target did reply saying we expect to carry SNES in stores and online, but we don't have

1457
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:19,300
any info regarding pre-orders.

1458
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:24,440
So they may or may not be taking pre-orders and I guess this was a follow up to an earlier

1459
01:16:24,440 --> 01:16:28,120
tweet they said, where they said, good news, we'll have this item and it will be available

1460
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:31,440
for pre-orders, but it sounds like Target and their support team there that's working

1461
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:33,960
on Twitter and doesn't really have a consistent answer for that.

1462
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:40,640
And conspiracy theorists myself, um, I would like to say that I noticed that, Hmm, well

1463
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:45,080
this bad news about your online app sucking, let's let out some of those pre-orders.

1464
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:48,540
So we get the websites covering that instead.

1465
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:50,240
And that, Oh, Hey, the SNES classic was out there.

1466
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:51,560
It's got the positive spin out there.

1467
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:52,560
Interesting.

1468
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:56,060
And now no one's talking about the online app sucking.

1469
01:16:56,060 --> 01:17:01,000
I don't think, I think there it's, it's too much of a negative and a positive.

1470
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:04,720
You've seen the reviews for that online app in the stores, like on iTunes and on Google

1471
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:11,400
play, people are, people are not nice, but at the same time, it's not a nice app.

1472
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:18,320
So I can't, you know, there's appropriate ways to take out your anger, throwing a shoe

1473
01:17:18,340 --> 01:17:21,740
at a stage to some woman who's just contracted to be there.

1474
01:17:21,740 --> 01:17:23,860
That's probably not one of the ways you should do it.

1475
01:17:23,860 --> 01:17:29,300
Um, but I suppose a review on a site like iTunes, um, may be effective.

1476
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:36,300
You know, Nintendo's got to look at that two star rating and go, Hmm, that doesn't, we

1477
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:37,900
got two stars.

1478
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:38,900
Wow.

1479
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:39,900
All right.

1480
01:17:39,900 --> 01:17:42,940
Anyhow, let's move on dark soccer.

1481
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:52,580
Well, um, we were at one time World of Warcraft players and have played other, I would say

1482
01:17:52,580 --> 01:17:57,000
Blizzard games, but this one is a little bit surprising.

1483
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:02,640
Um, Blizzard actually laid off, uh, Russell Brower, I guess that's how you say his last

1484
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:03,640
name.

1485
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:10,640
Um, who was, uh, the senior audio director and composer who's worked on a World of Warcraft,

1486
01:18:10,660 --> 01:18:17,020
Overwatch, Starcraft two, Diablo three, Hearthstone, and all kinds of things he put on his Facebook

1487
01:18:17,020 --> 01:18:26,020
that, um, and would there being some adjustments within the company that his position was made,

1488
01:18:26,020 --> 01:18:34,620
uh, redundant, it, it was eliminated, um, which I suppose is a big shock.

1489
01:18:34,620 --> 01:18:38,380
I mean, for a lot of people, he's had his, you know, his fingers in a lot of Blizzard

1490
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:46,560
projects and, um, I mean, I would, they might have him freelance, I don't know, but still

1491
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:49,720
that's just kind of crappy.

1492
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:50,720
Actually it's a lot crappy.

1493
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:51,720
Yeah.

1494
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:54,600
I mean, it's kind of, it's kind of painful to hear that when you think about like what

1495
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:58,240
great music World of Warcraft had, like I will still always love like the Grizzly Hills,

1496
01:18:58,240 --> 01:19:01,240
like when you go into that zone for the first time, that's an amazing song.

1497
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:04,160
And, you know, obviously there's a lot of, you know, big, big stuff for World of Warcraft.

1498
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:08,180
So it's, it's sad to hear about that, but I mean, it kind of sounds like the door is

1499
01:19:08,180 --> 01:19:11,520
open where it's like, well, he's not a full time employee, but he can still, it doesn't

1500
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:17,640
mean that like, it doesn't sound like it ended ugly, like, um, like the halo, the guy who

1501
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:21,280
did the halo song for Bungie, it sounds like that didn't end so well.

1502
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:24,700
But this one sounds a little more like, well, the door's open, so maybe there's freelance

1503
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:31,560
in the future, but maybe be nice and we'll give you a big parting bonus or it's in like

1504
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:33,360
some work disclosure.

1505
01:19:33,660 --> 01:19:38,500
Uh, Slykic from Game Buoy is in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com saying, Blizzard

1506
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:42,900
did a Heroes of the Storm themed employee outing at Medieval Times in Buena Park.

1507
01:19:42,900 --> 01:19:44,620
They put on a special show for them.

1508
01:19:44,620 --> 01:19:45,620
Did you hear that?

1509
01:19:45,620 --> 01:19:47,420
Yeah, I heard, I saw that on Twitter actually.

1510
01:19:47,420 --> 01:19:50,020
So Blizzard does things like that for the employees sometimes.

1511
01:19:50,020 --> 01:19:53,780
They also did, they, one night they did, um, this is a couple of years ago, but I remember

1512
01:19:53,780 --> 01:19:59,100
hearing after BlizzCon, they rented the World of Color thing at Disney California Venture

1513
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:01,420
and they did like a Blizzard World of Color.

1514
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:07,200
But it was just like, it wasn't anything, it was like their trailers on the water screen.

1515
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:09,560
It wasn't like they didn't go out of their way to do a bunch of effects.

1516
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:12,360
But still, for employees, it's got to be really exciting.

1517
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:14,400
It is pretty crazy.

1518
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:15,400
Thank you, RageNator.

1519
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:16,400
Martin O'Donnell is a Halo composer.

1520
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:18,040
Yeah, I heard it didn't end well between him and Bungie.

1521
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:22,000
I remember that came up on the show a while ago, but, um, yeah, or actually it was Activision

1522
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
more, but anyway.

1523
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,000
All right.

1524
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:28,400
Uh, let's, uh, let's move on.

1525
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:31,900
Just got a couple more stories for you guys before we get to the classic game of the week,

1526
01:20:31,900 --> 01:20:32,900
Loki.

1527
01:20:32,900 --> 01:20:33,900
I don't get this.

1528
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:39,100
This is kind of stupid, but, um, you know, there's this whole Overwatch league, um, that,

1529
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:43,660
you know, it's their esports league that they were trying to trademark their logo, which

1530
01:20:43,660 --> 01:20:49,740
has Tracer and it's kind of like, you know, the multicolored logos you see for like several

1531
01:20:49,740 --> 01:20:50,740
sports franchises.

1532
01:20:50,740 --> 01:20:56,340
And well, one of those sports franchises, Major League Baseball, is saying, hey, it's

1533
01:20:56,340 --> 01:20:58,440
too similar to our logo.

1534
01:20:58,440 --> 01:21:00,320
You can't trademark this.

1535
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:04,800
So they filed an appeal, but they haven't, they filed an extension on their appeal, but

1536
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:07,840
they haven't yet filed an appeal for it and the deadline's actually coming up in about

1537
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:08,840
three days.

1538
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:13,420
But it doesn't look anything like the fucking Major League Baseball logo and besides on

1539
01:21:13,420 --> 01:21:19,080
top of that, I think if you have any qualms against any sort of logo like that, then what

1540
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:20,640
about Major League Gaming?

1541
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:22,760
I mean, come on.

1542
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:24,600
That's more of a rip off of that than anything.

1543
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:27,460
And they're like, what about the NBA has the same type of thing or NHL?

1544
01:21:27,460 --> 01:21:31,660
I mean, there's like a ton of fucking logos out there that look all the same.

1545
01:21:31,660 --> 01:21:38,380
It is also pretty clear to me that in one logo, the person is holding a baseball bat

1546
01:21:38,380 --> 01:21:41,460
and the other logo, the person is holding a gun.

1547
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:43,100
It's also different colors.

1548
01:21:43,100 --> 01:21:44,740
It's also different fonts.

1549
01:21:44,740 --> 01:21:49,220
Also the, the way the words are lined up is different.

1550
01:21:49,220 --> 01:21:52,620
It's just sounds like, hmm, up and coming popular.

1551
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:54,160
Is MLB afraid of something?

1552
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:56,360
Yeah, I think so.

1553
01:21:56,360 --> 01:21:57,360
Sounds like it.

1554
01:21:57,360 --> 01:22:02,760
After all, we had Evo on ESPN on Sunday night.

1555
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:04,920
They're pulling higher numbers in some of their games.

1556
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:08,120
So just, I don't know, just, just theorize.

1557
01:22:08,120 --> 01:22:10,640
I guess we'll have to follow and see what happens with this.

1558
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:15,480
Hopefully they won't file any sort of, um, appeal.

1559
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:19,900
So they're, like I said, the deadline for their submission has to be the 26th.

1560
01:22:19,900 --> 01:22:24,780
And so if they don't file anything, then there's no opposition and they're going to basically

1561
01:22:24,780 --> 01:22:26,960
just allow them to have that.

1562
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:27,960
All right.

1563
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:32,000
Well, a little more for you here before we get to the classic game of the week, but this

1564
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:35,800
is about a classic game and this all seems to be happening all at once.

1565
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:40,520
I don't know if this is because of the Castlevania and how well that's been doing on Netflix,

1566
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:43,160
but Jason mentioned at the intro at the top of the show tonight, there's been kind of

1567
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:45,000
a flood of this media stuff this week.

1568
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,620
And yeah, there has been.

1569
01:22:46,620 --> 01:22:50,340
Get this, Galaga of all things.

1570
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:51,340
That's right.

1571
01:22:51,340 --> 01:22:55,720
The old 80s Namco game, Galaga, supposed to be made into a animated series.

1572
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:56,720
That's right.

1573
01:22:56,720 --> 01:23:01,420
Sweden, uh, an LA based production company, the Nuttery Entertainment, the Nuttery, send

1574
01:23:01,420 --> 01:23:02,420
them to the Nuttery.

1575
01:23:02,420 --> 01:23:06,800
Uh, they're developing an animated series and other extensions of the Galaga brand.

1576
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:10,840
They've signed an agreement with bound by Namco, uh, which, uh, you know, obviously

1577
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:13,140
made Galaga and Galaxian and all that.

1578
01:23:13,140 --> 01:23:16,120
They're trying to develop new characters and stories based on Galaga, including an

1579
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:20,720
animated series titled Galaga Chronicles, huh?

1580
01:23:20,720 --> 01:23:25,420
So yeah, a quote there, we're incredibly honored to be able to work on such an amazing legacy

1581
01:23:25,420 --> 01:23:28,440
property and help launch it into the animated space.

1582
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:30,440
So it could be interesting.

1583
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:34,200
Um, Dar Sakura, I know you're a fan of Namco stuff.

1584
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:36,400
Uh, would you watch a Galaga cartoon?

1585
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:37,400
Sure.

1586
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:38,640
I watched a Salamander anime.

1587
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:39,640
Hmm.

1588
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:40,640
All right.

1589
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:44,660
Would you watch one based on Splatoon?

1590
01:23:44,660 --> 01:23:47,020
Because Splatoon is going to get one too.

1591
01:23:47,020 --> 01:23:48,020
What's that?

1592
01:23:48,020 --> 01:23:49,020
I haven't played any Splatoon.

1593
01:23:49,020 --> 01:23:50,020
It's cute.

1594
01:23:50,020 --> 01:23:52,660
I think, I think, I think Splatoon would make a good anime.

1595
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:54,520
I think it's a good like kid thing.

1596
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:59,740
Like I know we always taunt Nintendo at being like the kiddie company, but let's be real.

1597
01:23:59,740 --> 01:24:02,440
Like they made a first person, well, you know what I mean?

1598
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:04,460
Over the shoulder shooter or whatever you want to call it.

1599
01:24:04,460 --> 01:24:06,800
That isn't really a shooter, but it is.

1600
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:11,480
And it's a game that's like really fun for adults and kids can get into it.

1601
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:15,080
So it's not overly violent and I don't see any faults there now.

1602
01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:18,260
No, I mean, so like, yeah, Nintendo kind of hit the money on this.

1603
01:24:18,260 --> 01:24:22,040
So it makes a lot of sense that Splatoon is going to get an anime spinoff.

1604
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:27,080
Uh, it is being reported by Korokoro that the series will premiere on the Korokoro YouTube

1605
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:29,720
page on August 12th.

1606
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:33,280
There already is a Splatoon manga in magazine form.

1607
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:36,760
So it just makes sense that the anime is going to follow suit.

1608
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:38,480
There had been one for Metroid back in the day.

1609
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:42,520
Oh, they made a manga for Metroid.

1610
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:46,800
That a lot of the story points from the manga ended up in like super Metroid and some of

1611
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:48,840
the other Metroid games.

1612
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:52,800
Well then it could be interesting to see what develops with, uh, especially with how popular

1613
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:55,080
some of those Splatoon characters are really popular.

1614
01:24:55,080 --> 01:24:57,960
Like seriously, just look up Pearl and Marina.

1615
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:04,600
Well, the, the NES version of Strider was based off of a manga based off the arcade

1616
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:05,600
version.

1617
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:06,600
Right.

1618
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:10,680
Because that's why the Sega and Nintendo ones, even though they're both Strider are so different.

1619
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:11,680
Exactly.

1620
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:12,680
Excellent.

1621
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:18,760
Uh, anyhow, uh, well it may not be Metroid, but another classic game, uh, again, sounds

1622
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:21,920
like it's moving forward, is a Mega Man movie.

1623
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:25,800
Now, we first heard about this two years ago, but some movement happened.

1624
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:27,360
It's not in development hell anymore.

1625
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:30,260
It's in the final stages of negotiations to write and direct.

1626
01:25:30,260 --> 01:25:34,280
Sharon in entertainment, I hope I'm saying that right, is the producer behind this.

1627
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:42,880
The directors of the catfish film, we'll be heading up the project, but heroes actor

1628
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:47,360
Masi Oka, who played like that, uh, what was his name in heroes?

1629
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:48,360
Hero.

1630
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:49,360
Hero.

1631
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:50,360
Okay.

1632
01:25:50,360 --> 01:25:51,360
Thank you.

1633
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:53,120
I just remember he was the guy in the trailer in Times Square going, I did it.

1634
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:56,040
Honestly, he was one of the best parts of George Takei played his dad.

1635
01:25:56,040 --> 01:25:57,040
Yeah.

1636
01:25:57,040 --> 01:25:58,040
Yeah.

1637
01:25:58,040 --> 01:26:01,320
Like the key was, he was the hero in that show, literally.

1638
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:05,360
But anyway, uh, so he's involved with that, which I remember that was because he had done,

1639
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:06,720
he wasn't always an actor.

1640
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:10,640
Well, I guess that was always something he kind of did, but he was like a sci-fi, uh,

1641
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:12,280
FX guy before that.

1642
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:13,280
Wasn't he?

1643
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:14,280
I still remember reading about that.

1644
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:15,280
Yeah.

1645
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:18,360
I think he made that transition from that to like doing the acting in that show.

1646
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:20,520
And then obviously he was very popular in that show.

1647
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:25,400
Anyway, no idea when the film itself will be coming out, but I'm sure plenty more information

1648
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:26,400
will be out there.

1649
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:30,480
Uh, so it doesn't suck like the cartoon looks cause that cartoon looks like shit.

1650
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:32,200
Is that cartoon even come out yet?

1651
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:37,480
I thought we saw trailers, but why don't we have seen trailers for, but I thought it was

1652
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:38,480
early 2018 for that.

1653
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:39,480
I don't know.

1654
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:40,480
All right.

1655
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:41,480
All right.

1656
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:42,480
Well, anyhow.

1657
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:43,480
Well, it looks weird.

1658
01:26:43,480 --> 01:26:44,480
I was just like, sorry.

1659
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:45,480
Just interrupt again.

1660
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:55,160
Um, we have all these like, oh yeah, movies and cartoon game, game, anywhere it's like

1661
01:26:55,160 --> 01:26:57,080
fucking hot topic in invader Zim.

1662
01:26:57,080 --> 01:27:00,160
Oh, let's put out all the fucking invaders in merchandise, but fuck you.

1663
01:27:00,160 --> 01:27:04,920
We're not giving you another show until of course new Nintendo Rocko's modern life fucking

1664
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:11,720
trailer for that looks awesome, but yeah, I mean the movie is nice.

1665
01:27:11,720 --> 01:27:14,780
I guess it's good to test the waters to see if it's something to bring back.

1666
01:27:14,780 --> 01:27:17,440
I think Mark Rocco's modern life would be good in invader Zim.

1667
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:18,880
I'm all for that.

1668
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:19,880
Come on.

1669
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:20,880
No Gus.

1670
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:23,920
In our chat over at live.vognetware.com says I want to kid Icarus reboot so that I can

1671
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:26,120
cosplay as eggplant wizard.

1672
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:29,240
A you can already cosplay as eggplant wizard if you want.

1673
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:31,080
I think the eggplant wizard was iconic enough.

1674
01:27:31,080 --> 01:27:32,080
Okay.

1675
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:33,080
Eggplant wizard was in captain in, right?

1676
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:34,080
If I remember, right?

1677
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:35,080
Uh, yes.

1678
01:27:35,080 --> 01:27:36,080
I think so.

1679
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:37,080
Yes.

1680
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:38,080
It also was iconic enough for the game and was also terrible.

1681
01:27:38,080 --> 01:27:41,720
But B I just want to remind you the eggplant wizard and the eggplant emoji have nothing

1682
01:27:41,720 --> 01:27:42,720
in common.

1683
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:45,600
So just if that's where you're going with that, just, just, just a little word of caution

1684
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:49,600
for the eggplant wizard to be a perfect character for another smash game.

1685
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:50,600
I think so.

1686
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:53,760
I think the eggplant wizard would be, I think, I think, I think that the eggplant wizard

1687
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:54,800
is a good character.

1688
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:55,800
And the dude from Actraiser.

1689
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:56,800
Do, do for a comeback.

1690
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:57,800
Yes.

1691
01:27:57,800 --> 01:27:58,800
Dude from Actraiser.

1692
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:00,520
Uh, eggplant wizard.

1693
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:03,680
We need to, maybe this is a list list we need to do in the future.

1694
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:07,360
The, the character that's due for a fucking comeback.

1695
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:09,640
Just like we had Duck Hunt, right?

1696
01:28:09,640 --> 01:28:12,360
We had that fucking dog came back in smash.

1697
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:13,680
Character due for a comeback via smash.

1698
01:28:13,680 --> 01:28:15,240
How about another Duck Hunt game?

1699
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:18,160
There's all these properties they can bring back.

1700
01:28:18,160 --> 01:28:19,280
Yeah.

1701
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:20,840
I like that.

1702
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:23,080
We're going to do that on a future show I think.

1703
01:28:23,080 --> 01:28:24,080
Character due for a comeback.

1704
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:28,320
In fact, if you're going to see NES classic edition two, I would be happy, I mean, I don't

1705
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:32,360
know how they would do a light gun game, but it would be cool to see with the zapper in

1706
01:28:32,360 --> 01:28:34,160
there and have all the light gun games in there.

1707
01:28:34,160 --> 01:28:35,160
All right.

1708
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:39,120
Let's travel back to a simpler time when we were playing games that featured eggplants

1709
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:41,040
and there was nothing wrong with that.

1710
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:44,000
The classic game of the week.

1711
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:48,960
Dark soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey,

1712
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:54,440
brat, play this game or I'll turn you into an eggplant.

1713
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:55,440
Sorry, Sakura.

1714
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:56,440
What is it?

1715
01:28:56,440 --> 01:28:58,000
Eggplants are kind of good though, actually.

1716
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,840
I actually make eggplant parmesan really nicely.

1717
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:05,440
My grandmother used to make it for me, so believe it or not, I have a lot of fond memories

1718
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:06,440
attached to eggplants.

1719
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:07,440
You know what I'm saying?

1720
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:08,440
It's one of those things...

1721
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:10,120
Sorry, I can't help it.

1722
01:29:10,120 --> 01:29:11,120
It's one of those things that people...

1723
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:12,120
Not those kind of memories.

1724
01:29:12,120 --> 01:29:17,520
It's one of those things that people love or they hate, but I find that I really like

1725
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:18,520
eggplant.

1726
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:20,080
Go figure.

1727
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:23,080
Okay, eggplant emoji.

1728
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:24,080
Classic game of the week.

1729
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:25,080
Dark Sakura.

1730
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:27,080
What should the kids be playing this week?

1731
01:29:27,080 --> 01:29:33,920
Senkoku or as it was in Japan, Senkoku Densho, which was a legacy of the Warring States to

1732
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:34,920
translate.

1733
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:36,200
Oh, it's a Neo Geo game.

1734
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:38,560
I love the Neo Geo startup logo.

1735
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:39,560
That's right.

1736
01:29:39,560 --> 01:29:40,560
Let's have a moment.

1737
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:41,560
Rob, start it over.

1738
01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:42,560
We just heard it.

1739
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:43,560
Do it.

1740
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:44,560
Fine.

1741
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:45,560
Jamie made me.

1742
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:54,160
I hear that every time I turn on my Neo Geo.

1743
01:29:54,160 --> 01:29:57,560
Everybody now.

1744
01:29:57,560 --> 01:29:59,120
Sweet relief.

1745
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:06,880
Anyways, Senkoku actually was a series of games that were put out by SNK.

1746
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:12,480
It had several different ports and releases that came out.

1747
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:17,560
The original, of course, was for the Neo Geo arcade system.

1748
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:19,880
And that also means that we had...

1749
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:31,280
So then that was also the Neo Geo AVS, MVS, Neo Geo CD, Mega CD, and Super Famicom versions

1750
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:34,200
that apparently were...

1751
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:36,840
Some of them were canceled in North America.

1752
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:42,280
The arcade version was rereleased as SNK Arcade Classics Volume 1 in part of it.

1753
01:30:42,280 --> 01:30:47,720
And the Neo Geo version was rereleased for Virtual Console in 2001 with the sequels also

1754
01:30:47,720 --> 01:30:54,480
coming to Virtual Console, Senkoku 2, Senkoku 3 for US and PAL regions.

1755
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:59,200
And then in 2009 for PS2 and Windows, there was Senkoku Anthology.

1756
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:08,640
So basically, I like this game and I had forgotten about it until I watched a video review yesterday.

1757
01:31:08,640 --> 01:31:13,200
It almost kind of makes me think of Samurai Troopers.

1758
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:15,200
You remember that anime?

1759
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:18,880
Over here we got it as Ronin Warriors.

1760
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:27,880
It kind of makes me think a little bit of it because you have this dark undead dimension

1761
01:31:27,880 --> 01:31:37,960
that's still based in feudal Japan, or at least the mythology around it is, who come

1762
01:31:37,960 --> 01:31:41,200
to the modern world or the dimension train at crossover.

1763
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:50,840
And your two heroes are a ninja named Dave, in the US version, or in the Neo Geo version,

1764
01:31:50,840 --> 01:31:57,680
and a cowboy named Keld, although in the SNES one, they were Dan and Bill respectively,

1765
01:31:57,680 --> 01:32:06,880
who were descendants of the original samurai who banished the asshole warlord back when.

1766
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:14,320
So you start off with six health points, and then after you beat certain enemies, you

1767
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:20,640
get these powerful forms that you can transform into, that you can toggle which one you go

1768
01:32:20,640 --> 01:32:24,880
into, although in the SNES one you can't.

1769
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:31,240
You've got a wolf form, you have a ninja form, you have a samurai form, and they've got their

1770
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:34,440
own special power-ups that go on along with the game.

1771
01:32:34,440 --> 01:32:42,880
But the neat thing about this game is that you can hit these warp areas that take you

1772
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:50,920
from a modern day, or by modern I mean 1991 setting, and send you into this mythical feudal

1773
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:55,360
Japanese setting.

1774
01:32:55,360 --> 01:33:00,320
Banners broken in the background, and even the music changes, and the music in this game

1775
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:01,600
is freaking great.

1776
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:06,760
It actually has one of my favorite game soundtracks.

1777
01:33:06,760 --> 01:33:10,520
And on top of that, one of the things in the arcade version is that there is a reference

1778
01:33:10,520 --> 01:33:16,600
to the game Athena, where- Neo Geo has a lot of subtle references to that game, it really

1779
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:17,600
do.

1780
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:18,600
Well, it was another SNK game.

1781
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:19,960
Yeah, no, I know, I know, it was like one of their first, yeah.

1782
01:33:19,960 --> 01:33:25,560
But it even has dress shop Athena, and it's in the Athena font, with a schoolgirl dressed

1783
01:33:25,560 --> 01:33:29,360
on a mannequin in the background, it's pretty cool.

1784
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:34,240
So anyway, as you go through the game, you have to survive being attacked by the enemies

1785
01:33:34,240 --> 01:33:35,960
and collect your power-ups.

1786
01:33:35,960 --> 01:33:42,600
Five green orbs will heal one health point, and a red orb will give you a single sword,

1787
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:48,640
a cyan one will give you a double sword, and the purple one gives you a two-handed holy

1788
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:56,440
sword, and a yellow one will give you a magic attack.

1789
01:33:56,440 --> 01:34:04,800
And now here's the bad thing, as much as I would love to love on the SNES one, it actually

1790
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:11,000
suffers from a lot of the limitations of having a slower processor.

1791
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:15,640
On top of that, the music really isn't all that great, although the SNES can do a pretty

1792
01:34:15,640 --> 01:34:18,320
decent shakuhachi sound.

1793
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:24,160
Anyway, of course the Neo Geo version is perfect, the Neo CD version is perfect.

1794
01:34:24,160 --> 01:34:33,320
The only thing that I remembered as being a problem with the arcade one is that it played

1795
01:34:33,320 --> 01:34:39,240
kind of sluggishly anyway, and of course the Super Famicom one was even worse.

1796
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:42,860
Now the Mega Drive one, because I had never played the Mega Drive one, but I was watching

1797
01:34:42,860 --> 01:34:51,840
the review of it, and the same company that did the port of it had done plenty of other

1798
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:56,200
games, and it looks like it plays fine, the music is there, the music is the arcade music

1799
01:34:56,200 --> 01:35:03,160
because it's Mega CD, it just doesn't have as beautiful as a color palette.

1800
01:35:03,160 --> 01:35:11,040
But I think the music in this game is absolutely wonderful, and the game itself, it has a lot

1801
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:16,000
of good things going on for it, it just needs to be a little bit more fun to play.

1802
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:22,400
But for one of those, it was really I think ambitious in terms of story, and the design

1803
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:29,040
of the game, and the way that it played, and as you went through various different settings,

1804
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:31,680
it's just very fascinating.

1805
01:35:31,680 --> 01:35:34,320
Shame it just wasn't more fun to play, that's all.

1806
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:37,080
But that's the game, Sengoku Densho.

1807
01:35:37,080 --> 01:35:43,880
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, a Neo Geo classic, Sengoku.

1808
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:47,160
Let's hear it one more time, Darkstalker, one more time, one more time.

1809
01:35:47,160 --> 01:35:48,160
Okay.

1810
01:35:48,160 --> 01:36:01,360
We just need a collection of those for bumpers, like that remixed with the old Capcom Q sound.

1811
01:36:01,360 --> 01:36:04,680
Yeah, all the old start-up noises, the GameCube, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio live tonight on this sunday night with episode

1828
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:45,680
number 695 of our show we're just a few episodes away from 700 if you can believe it uh if

1829
01:36:45,680 --> 01:36:49,160
you are just joining us here live you've missed a lot of chat like earlier in the show

1830
01:36:49,160 --> 01:36:53,480
we were talking about the pokemon go fest and our buddy charles from the pokemon go

1831
01:36:53,480 --> 01:36:57,600
podcast was actually here and uh i've been talking to him a little bit on twitter even

1832
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:01,520
though i obviously couldn't be here live tonight but he did want to mention that uh he did

1833
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:04,800
have some videos that he took the event if you want to check that out it's over on their

1834
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:09,280
facebook page so just check it out over at facebook.com slash pokemon go podcast you

1835
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:13,960
can check out those videos uh in the meantime we're gonna get back into some rapid fire

1836
01:37:13,960 --> 01:37:23,720
news loki so here's some new fodder for nintendo to dmca um smit there's a smash brothers fan

1837
01:37:23,720 --> 01:37:29,520
game called super clash brothers it basically takes the characters in smash brothers and

1838
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:34,720
puts them in their wonderful 8 and 16 bit iterations and then of course there's a whole

1839
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:38,840
game based on that so this one they've only got a few characters so far you've got mario

1840
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:46,760
luigi princess peach link sonic tales knuckles and mega man and of course you know every

1841
01:37:46,760 --> 01:37:51,480
character looks just like their you know sprite versions and i think even operates sort of

1842
01:37:51,480 --> 01:37:57,440
like their sprite versions as well so it's available to check out online until of course

1843
01:37:57,440 --> 01:38:03,520
it is um you know taken down by nintendo eventually so that would be terrible um the other fun

1844
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:10,720
thing there's a new mod for link to the past allows two people to share items online so

1845
01:38:10,720 --> 01:38:16,640
i guess it's somehow it it adds some some special code to allow a couple players to

1846
01:38:16,640 --> 01:38:24,040
actually coordinate items through the progress of the game and can change each other's inventory

1847
01:38:24,040 --> 01:38:31,160
that's kind of kind of weird um and they're saying that even i guess you can communicate

1848
01:38:31,160 --> 01:38:37,920
with your teams over skype and stuff um that's definitely a unique mod for that too bad it's

1849
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:44,080
not like co-op though in zelda that'd be pretty cool yeah it's kind of a bummer they don't

1850
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:47,360
like officially release something like that that's like when they like put multiplayer

1851
01:38:47,360 --> 01:38:51,320
in skyrim with a mod you know something that people kind of wanted but bethesda didn't

1852
01:38:51,320 --> 01:38:56,920
i guess think the balance would work right but at modders to the rescue right yeah so

1853
01:38:57,160 --> 01:39:03,160
neat well uh maybe uh maybe ubisoft will be looking at a zelda-like game on the nintendo

1854
01:39:03,160 --> 01:39:07,320
switch who knows what they're working on we don't know but ubisoft has said that they are working

1855
01:39:07,320 --> 01:39:11,800
on more titles for nintendo switch this is during a recent earnings call but of course no more

1856
01:39:11,800 --> 01:39:16,440
details just that the games will be announced soon we don't know if they're ports we don't know if

1857
01:39:16,440 --> 01:39:21,080
they're new games all together or like you know new uh platforms for games that are scheduled

1858
01:39:21,080 --> 01:39:25,800
to come out like maybe the south park game but that's you know obviously i'm i'm totally making

1859
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:30,520
shit up right now um but we'll see we'll find out i would imagine gamescom might be a good time in

1860
01:39:30,520 --> 01:39:35,000
the near future to announce that stuff obviously i would imagine yeah ubisoft has a lot of operations

1861
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:40,440
in france uh so that's only a few weeks away yeah so that'll be a good time but we'll see we'll see

1862
01:39:40,440 --> 01:39:46,440
uh but that would make a lot of sense uh also could the end of me verse be coming um i guess

1863
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:50,280
it would make a lot of sense after all since the wii u has kind of been kicked to the curb at this

1864
01:39:50,280 --> 01:39:56,360
point nintendo did do an update to the wii u this update contains text now keep in mind this text

1865
01:39:56,360 --> 01:40:00,200
is not displayed on the screen somebody's gone through the files and found this that says the

1866
01:40:00,200 --> 01:40:04,680
me verse service has ended me verse and any software features that make use of me verse

1867
01:40:04,680 --> 01:40:09,080
are now unavailable again nintendo has announced anything official yet it's just it seems like the

1868
01:40:09,080 --> 01:40:13,560
wording is in there in their most recent software updates that's really all we know right now

1869
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:19,800
but again i mean it kind of makes sense that it would go away except it's it's on the 3ds as well

1870
01:40:19,800 --> 01:40:24,600
and the 3ds is still supported by me just you know break it for the wii u i want to know what

1871
01:40:24,600 --> 01:40:28,680
this breaks so when they get rid of this what's this going to break everything is it going to

1872
01:40:28,680 --> 01:40:32,440
break like mario maker i mean how does that work yeah i don't know if it breaks mario maker and

1873
01:40:32,440 --> 01:40:39,480
splatoon or what happens with that um and how far out is it it could be maybe this is the last major

1874
01:40:39,480 --> 01:40:43,400
system patch for the wii u or something and so they're putting that text in there preemptively

1875
01:40:43,400 --> 01:40:52,360
i don't know but again this is all still really premature so all right uh moving on dark sakura

1876
01:40:53,400 --> 01:41:00,280
well um we know we uh all enjoy our super mario maker at least we some of us are still giving it

1877
01:41:00,280 --> 01:41:04,680
the time of day yeah i did uh i did the post show stream last week was mario maker we had a lot of

1878
01:41:04,680 --> 01:41:14,680
fun well now um a fan has made a mario 64 maker basically um you use your camera perspective and

1879
01:41:14,680 --> 01:41:20,520
put things where you want and you would play them through emulation or through you know like

1880
01:41:20,520 --> 01:41:30,680
a rom writer or something so pretty neat um it is available um online um you just have to look it up

1881
01:41:31,480 --> 01:41:39,080
um and you know before someone takes it down so and in other news for folks who are fans of

1882
01:41:39,080 --> 01:41:45,400
ultra street fighter 2 they have released now or figured out how to play as shin akuma

1883
01:41:46,200 --> 01:41:54,040
or as he was in japan goki so to do this you choose you highlight color one press cancel

1884
01:41:54,040 --> 01:41:58,200
then choose ken highlight number uh color nine then press cancel

1885
01:41:58,200 --> 01:42:04,200
choose sagat highlight color eight then press cancel choose m bison highlight color seven

1886
01:42:04,200 --> 01:42:09,800
press cancel highlight the random select then press l and r simultaneously good lord you have

1887
01:42:09,800 --> 01:42:17,080
to do that each time you want to play oh oh that's fucking hell that's stupid so well it's an arcade

1888
01:42:17,080 --> 01:42:21,800
ish thing to do i guess no it's stupid it's an arcade thing arcade ish thing to do in an arcade

1889
01:42:21,880 --> 01:42:27,400
that has no sort of like static memory to know that it's updated you know an unlock or something

1890
01:42:27,400 --> 01:42:35,560
like that that's on capcom not nintendo that is just stupid all right well anyhow i do want to

1891
01:42:35,560 --> 01:42:39,480
go to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com because some interesting uh insight the me verse thing

1892
01:42:39,480 --> 01:42:43,800
really struck a chord with a lot of people in chat uh when we were talking about that uh jd

1893
01:42:43,800 --> 01:42:49,160
and chat says the my nintendo thing still gives weekly me verse check-ins i don't expect them to

1894
01:42:49,160 --> 01:42:54,840
disable that until they roll out switch rewards on my nintendo uh act dev points out there's a me

1895
01:42:54,840 --> 01:43:03,160
verse stage in smash wii u so uh let's see uh also in chat at live.vognetwork.com dark tetsuya

1896
01:43:03,160 --> 01:43:08,040
theorizes maybe it'll tie into nintendo's new online maybe have a me verse style service on

1897
01:43:08,040 --> 01:43:12,920
switch well what's interesting to see if you haven't already seen splatoon 2 kind of built

1898
01:43:12,920 --> 01:43:17,160
its own me verse within the game and that's where you're seeing a lot of these pictures that look a

1899
01:43:17,160 --> 01:43:22,200
lot like me verse show up but they're just kind of embedded in splatoon 2 so that's kind of weird

1900
01:43:22,200 --> 01:43:27,560
but anyway uh dark tetsuya saying about the code by the way what i thought really neat about this

1901
01:43:27,560 --> 01:43:34,920
code this is the street fighter code is the color numbers spell out 1987 get it and hey to be fair

1902
01:43:34,920 --> 01:43:39,400
you have to do the same type of thing to unlock akuma in street fight excuse me street fighter

1903
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:45,640
originally so i remember all the drama you had to go through to unlock roll it is it is it is

1904
01:43:45,640 --> 01:43:49,080
one of those things that once you do it once it should kind of be permanent but whatever all right

1937
01:47:13,880 --> 01:47:20,680
a later date on it i don't know mailbox shenanigans because that other one i know when

1938
01:47:20,680 --> 01:47:27,480

1939
01:47:27,480 --> 01:47:36,600
after okay well sorry rama well we complemented his email a lot last week so yeah but this seems

1940
01:47:36,600 --> 01:47:44,520
to be different oh well maybe he sent a revised version with an attachment i meant none of that

1941
01:47:45,240 --> 01:47:49,880
hell with all you i meant it all i didn't mean any of it i'll move forward that's fine

1950
01:48:43,960 --> 01:48:50,840
this is called fucking stupid splatfest battles oh i already know what this is gonna be about i

1951
01:48:50,840 --> 01:48:55,720
know this is gonna be about somebody is trying to get me to fucking rant tonight read it okay

1952
01:48:55,720 --> 01:49:02,040
hello humanoids there's a link to a twitter thing on friday nintendo announced the next

1953
01:49:02,120 --> 01:49:08,120
platoon 2 splatfest battle will be team mayo versus team ketchup to which sky remarked

1954
01:49:10,360 --> 01:49:17,240
fuck off this is disgusting and an attack and i stand by my statement personally i just think

1955
01:49:17,240 --> 01:49:22,920
it's fucking stupid can you agree of any other fucking stupid splatfest battles they could do

1956
01:49:22,920 --> 01:49:29,320
how about team pinot noir versus team savignon block uh stable stay black writer dude i would

1957
01:49:29,320 --> 01:49:34,440
participate i i think a good splatfest would be team red wines versus white wines i think that's

1958
01:49:34,440 --> 01:49:37,880
a decent one worth having except that this is supposed to be a kids game but they can find a

1959
01:49:37,880 --> 01:49:41,880
creative way to word it like what's your favorite grape you like red grapes or white grapes that's

1960
01:49:41,880 --> 01:49:47,720
how you do it it would be and i think it's team box wine versus team bottle wine i it's all

1961
01:49:47,720 --> 01:49:52,840
delicious i just want to remind people the reason why i feel so strongly about this is i really

1962
01:49:52,840 --> 01:49:58,440
fucking hate mayonnaise and what what drives me bonkers about it is that it's not this well it

1963
01:49:58,440 --> 01:50:05,720
isn't it isn't splatfest itself this is an excuse for people to tag me on twitter talking about team

1964
01:50:05,720 --> 01:50:12,440
mayo and i'm just like shut up it's not fun i don't know if i'd be comfortable with a lot of

1965
01:50:12,440 --> 01:50:19,080
squid shooting substances that are similar to mayo around in that game you know what i hate ketchup

1966
01:50:19,080 --> 01:50:24,360
well here here's here's the thing i'm i i don't even really like ketchup i guess i'm team ketchup

1967
01:50:24,360 --> 01:50:30,680
by default but i am with the emailer i am team this is just ridiculous in general but i i'm only

1968
01:50:30,680 --> 01:50:38,040
team ketchup because i have to be but in the reality i'm going to california extreme this

1969
01:50:38,040 --> 01:50:45,080
weekend anyway right preach splatfest can kind of kiss my submarine sandwich guess what what

1970
01:50:45,080 --> 01:50:49,400
i'm not going to be in the cast at california extreme we can play ddr that'll be fun wait

1973
01:51:01,240 --> 01:51:07,560

1978
01:51:33,160 --> 01:51:39,480
i'm gonna fucking make plans the first weekend of august i am doing something other than splatfest

1979
01:51:39,480 --> 01:51:46,600
what let's go to a museum i would i team art team art let's go to the rosa crucial museum read a

1980
01:51:46,600 --> 01:51:50,280
book we're going to sit we're going to san jose and we're going to go to the rosa crucial team

1981
01:51:50,360 --> 01:51:55,080
science win that time oh that's right they did an art versus science thing didn't they god damn it

1982
01:51:55,080 --> 01:52:00,600
all right anyway hi olr it's reginator again with another seemingly random question thank you for

1983
01:52:00,600 --> 01:52:09,640
saving us he said semen you know is it seemingly why don't they just do team tits and team ass

1984
01:52:09,640 --> 01:52:14,040
why don't they just do that is uh team i want to see the shirts to come along with that one

1985
01:52:14,040 --> 01:52:19,000
why can't you have both can we get like the like the boob like hats you know that they have

1986
01:52:19,640 --> 01:52:23,880
so what would it be team dick versus team ass no why not team tits and ass

1987
01:52:23,880 --> 01:52:30,760
team no no we need team dick too there are plenty of women that would still pick tits

1988
01:52:30,760 --> 01:52:37,240
there are not many men who have boobs like that all right team we'll do uh team eggplant emoji

1989
01:52:37,240 --> 01:52:43,400
versus team peach emoji okay okay okay okay so we'll have one week of team tits and ass and one

1990
01:52:43,400 --> 01:52:47,880
tea tea week of peach emoji and i'll just i'll just set them all up i'll set them all up okay

1991
01:52:47,880 --> 01:52:52,680
because nintendo can't possibly handle the i love this idea what we should do on the show

1992
01:52:53,320 --> 01:52:57,160
if we i'm sorry to derail the email but you know what this is far more important than whatever sale

1993
01:52:57,160 --> 01:53:03,720
he's going to talk about so love your agent here so here's the thing i think when splatfest is lame

1994
01:53:04,280 --> 01:53:13,400
we replace it and we say these are the new teams we overrule nintendo and their inferior online

1995
01:53:13,400 --> 01:53:19,160
system and we are officially overruling this week's team mayo like they could have done

1996
01:53:19,160 --> 01:53:27,000
instead of mayo and ketchup they could have done alfredo and marinara okay oh and i would still

1997
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:31,880
i would still be team marinara so anyway so but i think we should overthrow with team peach emoji

1998
01:53:31,880 --> 01:53:36,440
and team uh eggplant emoji that's a good one pesto versus marinara that even better anyway

1999
01:53:37,320 --> 01:53:44,040
i was just gonna break it but but but but i also will go out and and say there are men with nice

2000
01:53:44,040 --> 01:53:51,320
racks sure but i'm just saying it's not exactly and there's men with great asses just saying

2001
01:53:51,960 --> 01:53:58,360
it's all about the hip groove that's it okay so reginator talking about sales um

2002
01:53:59,240 --> 01:54:04,440
obviously most of us within the vog community enjoy video games to one extent or another

2003
01:54:04,440 --> 01:54:11,880
be it on console handheld or pc can't stand them but obviously we all don't have the time and or

2004
01:54:11,880 --> 01:54:17,080
energy to play games nearly as much as we would probably like and for various reasons that being

2005
01:54:17,080 --> 01:54:23,160
said is there any gaming specific gaming related media that you all like and make use of to fill

2006
01:54:23,160 --> 01:54:32,600
the void and what specifically um my iphone gaming related media i guess podcasts just

2007
01:54:32,600 --> 01:54:38,760
will pop yeah that goes without saying i just have my iphone yeah iphone is awfully convenient

2008
01:54:38,760 --> 01:54:45,080
i catch the pokemans at my desk gaming in your pocket and twitter and all that uh social media

2009
01:54:45,080 --> 01:54:50,840
i think is huge it's it's good and it's bad you know obviously there's a lot of good that comes

2010
01:54:50,840 --> 01:54:55,480
from social media and there's a lot of garbage so it's just kind of one of those depending on what

2011
01:54:55,480 --> 01:54:59,480
color glasses you're wearing on twitter i found a youtube channel that i absolutely fall in love

2012
01:54:59,480 --> 01:55:05,320
with and it's relaxing nintendo music which has like our tracks of nothing but the most relaxing

2013
01:55:05,320 --> 01:55:10,760
tracks from different games i like that i like three hour youtubes of people dissecting a two

2014
01:55:10,760 --> 01:55:15,560
minute pokemon trailer that was something shane introduced me to i was like wow this is uh this

2015
01:55:15,560 --> 01:55:22,200
is something i just discovered and i'm like it's our it's basically our show i discovered a channel

2016
01:55:22,200 --> 01:55:27,960
i think it's called like totally not jake who does like this dragon ball power level thing

2017
01:55:27,960 --> 01:55:32,200
and just listening that someone had the time to break down all the episodes and the manga and

2018
01:55:32,200 --> 01:55:39,880
try to figure it out i'm like dude i'm completely listening to this fascinated wrapped even and i

2019
01:55:39,880 --> 01:55:46,120
don't know why it's like well then usually i'm playing xenoverse at the same time so it's like

2020
01:55:46,120 --> 01:55:50,360
it's like when you eat food and watch cartoon network not cartoon network food network why

2021
01:55:50,360 --> 01:55:56,040
they say cartoon network or when you're like for people of that persuasion doing it while watching

2022
01:55:56,040 --> 01:56:01,800
important sure so i kind of miss g4 tv in that sense i mean not the later years but the earlier

2023
01:56:01,800 --> 01:56:07,560
years i missed tech and all that stuff i kind of missed that when that was more in its heyday both

2024
01:56:07,560 --> 01:56:12,360
those channels because you know that would be like i'm gonna zone out watch food network or i'm gonna

2025
01:56:12,360 --> 01:56:17,000
you know zone out watch uh cartoon network is like oh i can zone out watch the video game channel but

2026
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:23,480
now it's i suppose it's twitch is kind of that now so i mean twitch is a decent answer and if

2027
01:56:23,480 --> 01:56:27,960
when i say twitch i mean mixer i mean youtube and all of it in one big bucket but the video game

2028
01:56:27,960 --> 01:56:33,560
social streaming is is huge obviously twitch is a generic yeah i like kleenex like clean yeah

2029
01:56:33,560 --> 01:56:40,200
exactly uh loki really real quick gaming media i watched him i will even during work like as i'm

2030
01:56:40,200 --> 01:56:44,760
working stuff he watches the ready player one trailer over and over and over again no i already

2031
01:56:44,760 --> 01:56:51,560
did that today um so uh no i watch um well funny enough it's not really game really i watch a lot

2032
01:56:51,560 --> 01:56:57,320
of red letter media because they do funny reviews of movies and i like that um but like gaming

2033
01:56:57,320 --> 01:57:03,640
related stuff usually at home i'll watch a few different uh youtube channels so like ollie43

2034
01:57:03,640 --> 01:57:09,080
does a lot of grants without a mod videos and just like silly shit that's just like small um i'll

2035
01:57:09,080 --> 01:57:16,040
watch some of the replays of um awesome games on quick because those are pretty fun and then uh

2036
01:57:16,040 --> 01:57:23,320
helix snake because of his uh skate 3 glitch videos are just fucking hilarious and um you

2037
01:57:23,320 --> 01:57:30,920
occasionally i'll watch reviews from um oh what is it uh angry joe show although sometimes he

2038
01:57:30,920 --> 01:57:37,240
gets on my nerves um and then i've been listening i don't know uh jim sterling the jimquisition

2039
01:57:37,800 --> 01:57:41,560
you know i just like listening to a lot of i guess those are almost like podcasts well

2040
01:57:42,440 --> 01:57:46,440
especially uh jim sterling show and stuff is more like a podcast but

2041
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:50,680
i don't know i like their like opinions on stuff and it's entertaining to listen to

2042
01:57:50,680 --> 01:57:53,720
i don't listen to a whole time podcast occasionally i'll listen to the

2043
01:57:53,720 --> 01:57:58,520
uh completely unnecessary podcast with pat the nes punk and he talks about like stuff

2044
01:57:58,520 --> 01:58:02,440
and retro games and things i like the one where he talks to his neighbor

2045
01:58:04,680 --> 01:58:08,360
yeah they do that sometimes by the way it's totally not mark is the channel

2046
01:58:08,440 --> 01:58:12,200
so i linked one of them in the chat so that people know who i was talking about

2047
01:58:12,200 --> 01:58:15,400
i'm just going to chat because i noticed people in chat are also talking about

2048
01:58:15,400 --> 01:58:21,480
non-gaming things they zone out to dr tsuya says i think my non-gaming thing is dead malls lol

audiobooks based on games listen to game soundtracks and read the comics when i find them

2058

or watch twitch or reruns of old school gaming based tv shows you know i did actually read a lot

2059
01:59:22,840 --> 01:59:29,800
of comics based on i i had the first series of street fighter comics that came out before udon

2063
01:59:50,520 --> 01:59:57,880
read here so all right uh let's move on with some more gaming news loki so nintendo has filed a

2064
01:59:57,960 --> 02:00:07,400
trademark application in the eu for a graphical representation of nintendo controllers including

2065
02:00:07,400 --> 02:00:14,920
the nintendo 64 the previous time that they had done this was for the nes and the snes which

2066
02:00:15,480 --> 02:00:23,240
you may remember have now mini systems for them so the thought is hey they're gonna release a mini

2067
02:00:23,240 --> 02:00:30,200
n64 classic edition that you won't be able to buy maybe in 2018 or something to that effect

2068
02:00:30,840 --> 02:00:34,600
so that might be something to look forward to what can print money next

2069
02:00:34,600 --> 02:00:39,720
although how i mean not to be too shady but how many nintendo 64 games are going to be

2070
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:45,880
worthy of a collection are they going to cut it down to 15 games because i'm not i i mean how

2071
02:00:45,880 --> 02:00:52,600
many games are worth revisiting i'm sorry it sounds so shady but there's probably not quite

2072
02:00:52,600 --> 02:00:58,360
as rich of a collection as nintendo maybe they'll put the was it animal woods or whatever the fuck

2073
02:00:58,360 --> 02:01:04,040
that animal crossing game was originally yeah don't worry forest or whatever don't don't worry

2074
02:01:04,040 --> 02:01:09,480
is a type of food all right eat though what you're saying that it can't be a force of it

2075
02:01:09,560 --> 02:01:17,880
so i was close i had like two of the four syllables i don't know maybe they could put like

2076
02:01:17,880 --> 02:01:28,360
um you know mario 64 star mark mario kart mario kart superman yeah it's all superman 64 60 30

2077
02:01:28,360 --> 02:01:32,840
versions of it or something um i'm sure there's games that they could find on it it'd be golden

2078
02:01:32,840 --> 02:01:36,680
eye okay come on noga says golden eye if they can get the rights for it because was it was

2079
02:01:36,680 --> 02:01:42,920
it a nintendo that's a rare game yeah oh that might be get complicated but okay well if the

2080
02:01:42,920 --> 02:01:47,640
rights work out yeah golden i would be that that's all they it doesn't even need anything besides

2081
02:01:47,640 --> 02:01:54,760
banjo kazooie then and then people will fucking buy it if donkey kong 64 don't count country 64

2082
02:01:54,760 --> 02:02:02,680
um i don't know there's lots of games all right and folks in chat rock this should be a list list

2083
02:02:02,680 --> 02:02:09,000
maybe what god that's like three listless ideas from tonight but yeah i mean so i mean i'm curious

2084
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:14,760
to see what kind of hardware the super nintendo ones running on because the nes classic one could

2085
02:02:14,760 --> 02:02:21,080
play snes games genesis all that stuff and i want to say it did 64 games as well it wouldn't be

2086
02:02:21,080 --> 02:02:26,280
surprised it's the same hardware they just keep popping in the new shells pokemon puzzle league

2087
02:02:26,920 --> 02:02:36,200
hey you pikachu and um pokemon snap pokemon snap done but isn't hey pikachu need like a require a

2088
02:02:36,200 --> 02:02:41,640
microphone okay if nintendo can't fucking put a two dollar microphone into these things then

2089
02:02:41,640 --> 02:02:47,880
what's the point if i can't play hey you pikachu if nintendo can't put a voice app in their system

2090
02:02:47,880 --> 02:02:52,440
that has you know yeah why doesn't hey you pikachu just run through an app that they're

2091
02:02:52,520 --> 02:02:57,640
brilliant problem solved i think we need to go to a new story let's let's talk about a game that

2092
02:02:57,640 --> 02:03:01,800
came out recently that's uh really awesome actually since i now have i don't know i've

2093
02:03:01,800 --> 02:03:06,200
talked a lot about this on the show i finally bought a 4k monitor during the amazon prime

2094
02:03:06,200 --> 02:03:11,800
i don't have the video card yet that can quite pump out the 4k smooth visuals but i am getting

2095
02:03:11,800 --> 02:03:16,520
well i can do 4k video and i'm getting the 2k like i can play like that next level that's kind

2096
02:03:16,520 --> 02:03:21,880
of in between and so i've been playing doom a little bit with that and making myself barf

2097
02:03:21,880 --> 02:03:25,240
because that game moves so fast but it's awesome but i'm actually really happy to

2098
02:03:25,240 --> 02:03:34,200
hear that uh bethesda is going to be doing a doom 6.66 update which will unlock all the dlc

2099
02:03:34,200 --> 02:03:39,000
for free that's right all players are going to get all the dlc for free at least the multiplayer

2100
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:44,440
uh dlc which i think is all there was uh it'll also change up the progression system big time

2101
02:03:44,440 --> 02:03:48,920
because this time uh used to unlock random stuff kind of like you do in overwatch now

2102
02:03:48,920 --> 02:03:53,800
specific items and customizations will go for different levels so you can check that out my

2103
02:03:53,800 --> 02:03:58,600
question to you guys into our chat room is how do you feel though about that whereas i'm happy that

2104
02:03:58,600 --> 02:04:04,360
this is going free because i never touched the dlc how do you guys feel about if you go and buy dlc

2105
02:04:04,360 --> 02:04:09,720
for a game and then six months a year later it's free for everybody do you feel burned a little bit

2106
02:04:09,720 --> 02:04:17,880
or a little bit i guess but whatever they've done it in other games i suppose has xbox gold

2107
02:04:17,880 --> 02:04:23,880
or playstation the their rewards program if they ever done like dlc as a reward i don't think no

2108
02:04:23,880 --> 02:04:29,640
but like i've seen discounts i guess i've seen them do that before though i it's not a new thing

2109
02:04:30,680 --> 02:04:35,960
it's a rare thing because you know usually those companies are like oh let's make some money we

2110
02:04:35,960 --> 02:04:45,240
still want money money money money right um so um i don't know it's uncommon well i want to go

2111
02:04:45,240 --> 02:04:48,680
revisit this game now especially with all the multiplayer stuff i didn't play multiplayer

2112
02:04:48,680 --> 02:04:52,280
enough i kind of want to try it again see if i get it looks like getting mad at like a game of

2113
02:04:52,280 --> 02:04:55,880
the year edition comes out for something that you know it's cheaper anyways it's like you've been

2114
02:04:55,880 --> 02:05:02,040
playing it for a while now right right whatever you can't be too bad in our shape i thought this

2115
02:05:02,040 --> 02:05:10,600
next thing was really cool dark sakura what do you have for us well um the uh nbc uh it's actually

2116
02:05:10,600 --> 02:05:18,920
for nbc left field uh has decided to talk about who owns the moon and they did a video using

2117
02:05:18,920 --> 02:05:25,960
minecraft to explain who owns the moon it's actually really good the the things up on the

2118
02:05:25,960 --> 02:05:34,360
twitter channel um uh at nbc left field and i thought it actually was pretty informative there

2119
02:05:34,360 --> 02:05:40,120
were things that i knew but also a few things that i didn't know and it was really something

2120
02:05:40,200 --> 02:05:46,520
that i think could be understood by all ages but uh definitely something worth a watch um

2121
02:05:46,520 --> 02:05:53,480
for anyone in our chat room i would be more than happy to link it to you so um but it was really

2122
02:05:53,480 --> 02:06:01,640
cute and you know the other thing is that it goes to show that um that minecraft can be an

2123
02:06:01,640 --> 02:06:07,640
educational tool as well not just you know digging holes for stress relief like i do

2124
02:06:07,640 --> 02:06:14,600
so i only use it for programming they've got whole classes based on minecraft for programming

2125
02:06:14,600 --> 02:06:17,640
you know well now they have the minecraft education edition i mean this yeah this is

2126
02:06:17,640 --> 02:06:22,120
what kids are playing in school now as opposed to oregon trail which a number munchers like we all

2127
02:06:22,120 --> 02:06:29,080
kind of grew up with so my son this week got into roblox that thing is like weird what's that

2128
02:06:29,080 --> 02:06:35,000
roblox is like this um knockoff it's not really a knockoff minecraft i mean it's similar graphically

2129
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:39,640
to like a minecraft but it's basically imagine you know how they have like the different games

2130
02:06:39,640 --> 02:06:43,560
that people can make in minecraft like the little i don't know what you call them but the hunger

2131
02:06:43,560 --> 02:06:49,080
games mod yeah like some like mods but like imagine that that's all it is it's just these

2132
02:06:49,080 --> 02:06:53,160
mods that you go and play different rooms and they have different games that i mean they can

2133
02:06:53,160 --> 02:06:57,320
do the hunger games or whatever he did one that was called an ordinary elevator it had like a

2134
02:06:57,320 --> 02:07:04,520
bunch of weird shit and it like internet meme shit like he you know first time experiencing was it you

2135
02:07:04,680 --> 02:07:09,080
i'm a cat i'm a kitty cat and that's that sense and then says you know he's like and he thought

2136
02:07:09,080 --> 02:07:14,920
that was hilarious i'm like wow that's super old wait so your kids are just your kids are

2137
02:07:14,920 --> 02:07:19,080
discovering memes for the first time yeah he's discovering memes oh boy grow up so fast look out

2138
02:07:19,080 --> 02:07:25,800
then don't go to the dancing hamster site careful because roblox has also been uh notorious for

2139
02:07:25,800 --> 02:07:35,400
advertising via adware and for a number of numbers i'll just say be careful i'm sure he

2140
02:07:35,400 --> 02:07:42,280
has shit already has spam on it well like it yeah it has pop-ups if he's been exposed to dank memes

2141
02:07:42,280 --> 02:07:47,400
at such a young age it's already ruined it's already downhill from here but they have it at

2142
02:07:47,400 --> 02:07:53,000
the library you can play roblox at the library that's where he first played it oh wow so i mean

2143
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:59,080
if it's good enough for the public library system oh i'm sure that i'm sure nobody ever downloads

2144
02:07:59,080 --> 02:08:05,720
garbage the public library all right uh a few more stories for you guys then we're gonna get to

2145
02:08:05,720 --> 02:08:11,560
your calls at orange launch radio on skype but first loki so the next big marathon for twitch

2146
02:08:11,560 --> 02:08:18,520
what could it possibly be another pbs show no we'll actually have something gaming related to it

2147
02:08:18,600 --> 02:08:25,000
yes they're gonna be doing starcade awesome yes so they're gonna be marathoning starcade

2148
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:31,640
and it's gonna be awesome they say why just because we can they said that their page is

2149
02:08:31,640 --> 02:08:38,840
not gonna fucking load so is it because sometimes these events are for like charities like they did

2150
02:08:38,840 --> 02:08:43,880
the mr rogers thing because they were trying to like actually raise money for uh uh pbs i think

2151
02:08:43,880 --> 02:08:48,760
but uh did your period okay i got it um so they basically said this is a collaboration with the

2152
02:08:48,760 --> 02:08:54,280
blu-ray publisher shout factory who picked up the rights and i guess maybe it's to promote the

2153
02:08:54,280 --> 02:09:01,640
blu-rays that are gonna be coming out yeah um yes but yeah so they're gonna be running that's 130

2154
02:09:01,640 --> 02:09:08,360
episodes it's supposed to begin on august 22nd that's awesome and i guess it's gonna be broadcast

2155
02:09:08,360 --> 02:09:13,560
on shout factories twitch channel and i once again want to just throw my name in consideration

2156
02:09:13,560 --> 02:09:18,520
i know i'm a nobody zero on the internet but if starcade were to ever come back i would be the

2157
02:09:18,520 --> 02:09:23,720
best host ever of that show i'm just saying that would be my fucking dream so if anybody anybody

2158
02:09:23,720 --> 02:09:28,120
who is anybody is out there listening please consider rob roberts starcade 2017 because i

2159
02:09:28,120 --> 02:09:31,960
heard they were gonna bring try to bring this yeah that's what i heard too yeah so maybe this

2160
02:09:31,960 --> 02:09:36,120
is something to kind of gauge the interest for that i don't know so i'm sure i'm sure a lot of

2161
02:09:36,120 --> 02:09:41,880
people will be uh watching uh on twitch because i'm interested yeah me too i fucking love starcade

2162
02:09:41,880 --> 02:09:46,200
i grew up oh man i used that was the best part of g4 like in the afternoon you know i used to

2163
02:09:46,200 --> 02:09:54,360
come home for lunch watch an episode of starcade on g4 and eat whatever food ahead there you go

2164
02:09:55,560 --> 02:09:59,960
all right well uh hey if you can't watch the starcade marathon maybe this is something you

2165
02:09:59,960 --> 02:10:05,720
can listen to instead it's uh the adventures of bayou billy soundtrack that's right going back to

2166
02:10:05,720 --> 02:10:10,760
the 8-bit nes days the adventures of bayou billy was a konami game uh that was on the nes it was

2167
02:10:10,760 --> 02:10:16,200
actually it was actually kind of fucking terrible but it's still you know classic games are classic

2168
02:10:16,200 --> 02:10:20,920
games and some people still remember remember some things fondly even if they weren't necessarily

2169
02:10:20,920 --> 02:10:26,120
very good uh here's the crazy thing ship to shore photo company is hoping that fans of the original

2170
02:10:26,120 --> 02:10:29,640
game because you know it did have a it did have one of those cool konami soundtracks and a lot

2171
02:10:29,640 --> 02:10:33,960
of those 8-bit soundtracks uh from konami and back in the day were really cool the soundtrack

2172
02:10:33,960 --> 02:10:39,240
is going to be coming out on a vinyl album it will have the original nes famicom soundtrack

2173
02:10:39,240 --> 02:10:44,440
it's been remastered for vinyl it's going to have new cover art new linear notes and a special 11

2174
02:10:44,440 --> 02:10:51,880
by 17 poster um so that's cool for fans of uh bayou billy that's awesome even if i did not really

2175
02:10:51,880 --> 02:10:57,240
care for the game to which dark tetsuya and chat says shut your whore mouth it was fun part beat

2176
02:10:57,240 --> 02:11:01,400

2198

2200
02:13:03,800 --> 02:13:08,040
work this time hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hey there's that death it worked hi

2201
02:13:08,040 --> 02:13:13,880
act after what's on your mind buddy uh pokemon go ah yeah how was your weekend for pokemon go

2202
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:25,160
uh it was uh kind of good i tried to uh catch uh arthacona today uh had really really bad luck

2203
02:13:26,120 --> 02:13:29,640
oh no you didn't catch him or you weren't able to get a group together or what

2204
02:13:30,120 --> 02:13:36,280
uh no we act i actually saw lots of people that i was kind of surprised about that and

2205
02:13:37,240 --> 02:13:44,840
we actually did uh of the three arthacunas i participated in the race today uh we can't uh

2206
02:13:44,840 --> 02:13:51,320
we could uh sorry we defeated two uh one of them we just couldn't because we weren't enough

2207
02:13:52,280 --> 02:13:59,240
uh but at the time of the capture well that's just pretty tough i'll just say that um you're

2208
02:13:59,240 --> 02:14:02,360
cutting in a little in and out so you might want to check your mic i don't know it's getting like

2209
02:14:02,360 --> 02:14:06,680
loud and soft and loud and soft but that's always the joy of live radio is trying to fix things as

2210
02:14:06,680 --> 02:14:12,760
we go um but yeah yeah i mean i found part of like capturing the legendary stuff um over this

2211
02:14:12,760 --> 02:14:17,240
weekend it's just you know kind of neat how like all the people are coming together um you know it

2212
02:14:17,240 --> 02:14:21,720
is it is tricky because you're not guaranteed to get that legendary in fact they are very hard to

2213
02:14:21,720 --> 02:14:26,760
catch um and that makes some people kind of salty but at the same time i'm not i mean they would be

2214
02:14:26,760 --> 02:14:32,200
legendary if they're total gimmies you know what i mean so you gotta work a little bit for it a

2215
02:14:32,200 --> 02:14:36,360
little bit i mean you know if you've done it like nine times and still aren't catching it then

2216
02:14:36,360 --> 02:14:40,840
that's a little much especially you know and you're paying for those raid passes but if it

2217
02:14:40,840 --> 02:14:46,840
takes you two or three tries then that's okay i think oh yeah definitely it's uh something that

2218
02:14:47,560 --> 02:14:54,040
that's it shouldn't be free at least and it's gonna be tough i hopefully i can still do uh

2219
02:14:54,840 --> 02:15:01,160
this raids or that they don't uh stop showing up because that's that's something that Niantic

2220
02:15:01,160 --> 02:15:09,880
didn't clear up since they only said oh we're going to do the double xp the the egg thing and

2221
02:15:09,880 --> 02:15:16,120
all that stuff until monday but they didn't clarify if that also applies to uh to these

2222
02:15:16,120 --> 02:15:22,120
raids but hopefully not yeah i don't know it would be so dumb of them to just end the legendary

2223
02:15:22,120 --> 02:15:26,840
thing especially when we know that moltres and zapatos they're gonna happen it's just a matter

2224
02:15:26,840 --> 02:15:31,080
of whenever niantic wants to push the button but the rules of their little challenge were never

2225
02:15:31,080 --> 02:15:35,720
really that clear and obviously they threw it all out the window ever anyway and i kind of think we

2226
02:15:35,720 --> 02:15:40,200
got the conclusion that was already foregone is that everything was going to get unlocked anyway

2227
02:15:40,200 --> 02:15:44,040
but they never really made that clear which was kind of another issue with that whole event

2228
02:15:44,040 --> 02:15:49,320
but um by the way your mic sounded much better whenever you did fix it um so i want to ask you

2229
02:15:49,320 --> 02:15:52,200
real quick though what you think of all the stuff i don't know if you were here at the very beginning

2230
02:15:52,200 --> 02:15:55,080
of the show when charles is here what you think of all that stuff that was going on in chicago

2231
02:15:55,720 --> 02:16:01,960
uh i only uh well first of all i changed mics because uh i'm testing a new one but sorry about

2232
02:16:01,960 --> 02:16:09,560
that uh i i only caught the last part of that uh because i was outside uh trying to catch an article

2233
02:16:10,360 --> 02:16:20,120
fair excuse but yeah um i i think and i kind of agree that niantic does need to step up because

2234
02:16:20,120 --> 02:16:26,520
yeah the game has been out for a year and i do think that they have done a lot to change the

2235
02:16:26,520 --> 02:16:33,720
game and to fix it and to make it uh enjoyable but they do need to to step up they need to

2236
02:16:34,280 --> 02:16:40,920
work on a lot of things uh uh like people that still have the the problems with pokemon the the

2237
02:16:40,920 --> 02:16:49,560
plus uh uh watch i i i have heard of mine that cannot use uh her pokemon go plus because it won't

2238
02:16:49,560 --> 02:16:57,800
connect at all and it's kind of weird and and again uh the uh some people uh there weren't many

2239
02:16:57,800 --> 02:17:04,440
but some people today with uh on the raids were having problems uh like trying to get in the game

2240
02:17:04,440 --> 02:17:10,680
trying to get uh getting the uh the game running all that stuff and not to mention the the people

2241
02:17:11,480 --> 02:17:19,400
that went to the fest that that was a complete failure on their part but i did uh at least i'm

2242
02:17:19,400 --> 02:17:25,000
kind of optimistic on this and i think that diantic can learn from from this experience

2243
02:17:25,880 --> 02:17:34,440
and speaking of uh if should niantic uh sell or or give up pokemon go to another company

2244
02:17:35,080 --> 02:17:44,600
uh i was looking up a phrase about this that says it's uh sorry sorry

2245
02:17:46,920 --> 02:17:50,120
it's better the devil you know than the angel you don't

2246
02:17:50,280 --> 02:17:58,680
i like that so so yeah you uh we uh niantic can get rid of pokemon go i they would make

2247
02:17:58,680 --> 02:18:04,920
tons of money without selling it but i don't know if i would prefer another company handled

2248
02:18:04,920 --> 02:18:13,640
and uh handling pokemon go uh since niantic and despite uh my probably dislike for ingress because

2249
02:18:13,720 --> 02:18:18,680
that game i really don't don't see the appeal of playing it right now

2250
02:18:19,560 --> 02:18:28,600
at least they know how the stuff works it's even if if niantic screws uh lots of things up i i

2251
02:18:28,600 --> 02:18:35,240
think they at least they know their their core and they can and they can improve it and i hope

2252
02:18:35,240 --> 02:18:40,600
they do yeah i i do you know despite my criticisms in the beginning of the show i am rooting for

2253
02:18:40,600 --> 02:18:45,560
niantic this was just this was just a face plant of pretty epic proportions that that really should

2254
02:18:45,560 --> 02:18:50,520
have been avoided and i get i think you're kind of right in a way is that um you know heaven forbid

2255
02:18:50,520 --> 02:18:55,400
ea buys niantic i mean you know obviously i'm making i'm making up these completely crazy

2256
02:18:55,400 --> 02:19:00,840
scenarios but i'm just saying you know i don't know if niantic necessarily lost money i mean

2257
02:19:00,840 --> 02:19:04,760
yes they had to refund and so basically they had to front all the money for the park and all that

2258
02:19:04,760 --> 02:19:10,600
but they're making money on people buying all these raid passes to do the new legendary raids

2259
02:19:10,600 --> 02:19:15,960
so i don't know if niantic necessarily lost money on this event but there was a huge blown

2260
02:19:15,960 --> 02:19:21,480
opportunity in that regard and uh you know somebody's got to answer for that one way or another

2261
02:19:21,480 --> 02:19:27,800
so anyway yeah yeah definitely they're making tons of money so i i don't think there was that was uh

2262
02:19:27,800 --> 02:19:33,560
like complete loss yeah but yeah all right well acta thank you so much for your perspective and

2263
02:19:33,560 --> 02:19:38,040
good luck uh catching the continued legendaries when they roll out uh zapados and uh multerase

2264
02:19:38,040 --> 02:19:44,600
and all that stuff it'll be fun thank you all right take care my friend all right uh zach

2273
02:20:21,400 --> 02:20:26,520
funky but um i know you guys were talking about uh g4 earlier i kind of missed what the email

2274
02:20:26,520 --> 02:20:33,080
was about but um did you know that disney disney they have a network it's called a disney xd px

2275
02:20:33,640 --> 02:20:40,280
and i think yeah xd yeah that's what's called so they they switched that now over to what disney

2276
02:20:40,280 --> 02:20:44,360
b xp and i think it's uh i think it's for the entire weekend i think it's from like

2277
02:20:45,320 --> 02:20:50,120
from like friday to sunday they just do like a block a video game show from like nine and nine

2278
02:20:50,120 --> 02:20:54,680
at night to like three in the morning really somebody shows awful but um they have some good

2279
02:20:54,680 --> 02:21:00,440
ones in there no i want to see like is an ign show on there now or something i thought i read

2280
02:21:00,440 --> 02:21:05,320
yeah yeah that's about to come on in a like i think in another 30 minutes they got a four

2281
02:21:05,320 --> 02:21:09,320
ign episodes that are coming up i don't know what that show is i haven't watched it yet but um

2282
02:21:10,360 --> 02:21:14,360
the show that i did like that did impress me a little bit even though it's still for kids

2283
02:21:14,360 --> 02:21:19,240
and people with add there's a show called a polarized primetime and that's pretty good

2284
02:21:19,240 --> 02:21:24,280
like basically what that is is like um what's that show that the uh the woman does she's from

2285
02:21:24,280 --> 02:21:30,440
um she's from glee remember she did like a a game show where she's supposed to be in the living room

2286
02:21:30,440 --> 02:21:35,560
what do you call that show oh hollywood game night yeah it's almost like that you can kind

2287
02:21:35,560 --> 02:21:39,720
of say like they have like two celebrity guests then they have like the host and like they're

2288
02:21:39,720 --> 02:21:43,240
all supposed to be in their living room it's supposed to be like you're having a game party

2289
02:21:43,240 --> 02:21:47,640
or something you know like they have to guess it okay different games but um it's pretty fun and

2290
02:21:47,640 --> 02:21:51,880
interesting the only problem with it is since it's for kids it's really hard to keep up with

2291
02:21:51,880 --> 02:21:55,960
everything like everyone's yelling and screaming you know there's like these quick cuts and you

2292
02:21:55,960 --> 02:22:03,160
know you're like what the fuck it's like playing mario party in my house um that's i that sounds

2293
02:22:03,160 --> 02:22:08,040
neat i'll have to check that out i had no idea it was actually i did know of disney xd because

2294
02:22:08,040 --> 02:22:13,800
that's where the tron phineas and ferb well there's that too but the tron um what was the

2295
02:22:13,800 --> 02:22:20,200
tron not trom legacy tron something was the the anime yeah it was on disney xd but they aired it

2296
02:22:20,200 --> 02:22:24,200
like friday nights or something and i don't think i got the greatest ratings on there so that's why

2297
02:22:24,200 --> 02:22:29,400
they never did a second season but that's i was aware of tronic uh disney xd tron uprising thank

2298
02:22:29,400 --> 02:22:34,840
you that was it so but that's neat that they do like so so kind of like how cartoon network has

2299
02:22:34,840 --> 02:22:40,200
adult swim disney xd or whatever does a video game block late at night for the people who are up

2300
02:22:40,200 --> 02:22:45,640
that's interesting i like that the worst show on there uh to not get into names confusing with

2301
02:22:45,640 --> 02:22:54,680
a good show is called a polarized primetime the awful show is the polarized uh pick this player

2302
02:22:54,680 --> 02:22:58,920
or something like that where it's just like um it's just a bunch of youtube clips uh clips all

2303
02:22:58,920 --> 02:23:03,320
streamed together like what like they have like a box they have like a a little box with like

2304
02:23:03,320 --> 02:23:07,960
different youtubers in it and the box just jumps around randomly picks a youtube player and you

2305
02:23:07,960 --> 02:23:12,520
just watch like this nonsensical video that you can't even make heads or tails out of so it's

2306
02:23:12,520 --> 02:23:20,280
you're not the right age it's a tv show all about influencers sounds like a delight right yeah

2307
02:23:21,160 --> 02:23:27,880
yeah just terrible another great show um they uh they have like uh a fighting show i guess

2308
02:23:27,880 --> 02:23:31,880
it's going to be like their reality show and uh each week when some i think they're playing

2309
02:23:31,880 --> 02:23:35,640
street fighter each week when someone wins they become like the the king or something like that

2310
02:23:35,640 --> 02:23:40,760
they sit on the throne and then the next week they have they have to uh battle um the winner

2311
02:23:40,760 --> 02:23:44,680
out of the the next two people that play each other so they got they got a good thing going

2312
02:23:44,680 --> 02:23:48,440
with the network you need to check that out all right i like it i like it all right kaijuto

like yeah spell it slowly k-u-r-o-u-t-s-u-b-a-s-a okay dot tumblr.com okay um i have video um we're

2362
02:28:14,040 --> 02:28:18,680
borrowing cactus canyon right now which was a limited release pinball table toward the end of

2363
02:28:18,680 --> 02:28:25,160
the williams you know pinball um and there's mods out for it that could make it uh into what's

2364
02:28:25,160 --> 02:28:30,040
called cactus canyon continued that has like special skill shots and different multi-ball

2365
02:28:30,040 --> 02:28:34,680
modes in it so we've got one in our garage right now that we're borrowing from a friend and i have

2366
02:28:34,680 --> 02:28:41,960
video up of cowboys versus aliens multi-ball which basically goes from this crazy old west

2367
02:28:41,960 --> 02:28:48,920
theme with you know western you know theme song type background music into freaking dubstep with

2368
02:28:48,920 --> 02:28:54,920
shooting it is exactly that it's a skrillex song it's a remix but it's the best thing ever because

2369
02:28:54,920 --> 02:29:02,360
it changes the whole feel of the table and it is the most fun to play so most extra it is very

2370
02:29:02,360 --> 02:29:08,920
extra but for just it's on my tumblr so to check it out you know it's it's really a lot of fun okay

2371
02:29:08,920 --> 02:29:12,920
cool cool all right uh i guess that's your final thought i was gonna go around and give everybody's

2372
02:29:12,920 --> 02:29:19,400
final thought but i guess that was it that is all right my final thought is double stardust yay i

2373
02:29:19,400 --> 02:29:23,800
need more of it because i've already spent all the stardust i got playing pokemon go today when

2374
02:29:23,800 --> 02:29:28,280
i almost died because i was stupid and played in the heat and i walked for like two miles get a

2375
02:29:28,280 --> 02:29:32,520
parasol i've seen a lot of pokemon go players actually do that you know what you know what you

2376
02:29:32,520 --> 02:29:37,800
know what you should get one shaped like a star so it can be a parasol star or get one with pikachu

2377
02:29:37,800 --> 02:29:42,760
ears on it i've seen that i know i get i get it bubble bobble parasol stars i get it okay all

2378
02:29:42,760 --> 02:29:49,880
right uh loki last but not least your final thought uh i will try to play some games this week

2379
02:29:49,960 --> 02:29:54,440
because i didn't play needle last week that's a good resolution to have here on this show
