00:00.000 --> 00:17.160
This week, the next era of video games and non-interactive media is here on the heels

00:17.160 --> 00:21.120
of a critically successful and renewed Castlevania series comes announcements of additional series,

00:21.120 --> 00:22.120
movies and more.

00:22.120 --> 00:24.700
Tonight, the next episode of Orange Island Radio is here, chock full of the week's gaming

00:24.700 --> 00:31.700
news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:31.700 --> 00:35.100
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:35.100 --> 00:36.780
where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.780 --> 00:39.780
It is Orange Lounge Radio.

00:39.780 --> 00:46.500
Live tonight, episode number 695 for this July the 23rd of 2017.

00:46.500 --> 00:51.420
We of course are three folks here based out of Sacramento, California to talk about video

00:51.420 --> 00:53.580
games, gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle.

00:53.580 --> 00:54.920
I am Rob Roberts.

00:54.920 --> 00:55.920
She is DarkSakura.

00:55.920 --> 00:56.920
Hi.

00:56.920 --> 00:57.920
Hi.

00:57.920 --> 00:58.920
How are you?

00:58.920 --> 00:59.920
I'm okay.

00:59.920 --> 01:02.500
So this is the last Sunday with Das Boot on your foot, right?

01:02.500 --> 01:03.500
Yes.

01:03.500 --> 01:07.700
So I'm going to decorate it with stars on Tuesday so that when they cut it off, it'll

01:07.700 --> 01:10.500
be sparkly and my foot will be free.

01:10.500 --> 01:13.800
And what's going to happen is I'm going for a pedicure.

01:13.800 --> 01:17.660
Right when it's done, right after my doctor's appointment, I'm going to have a pedicure.

01:17.660 --> 01:19.440
I don't care how gross my foot is.

01:19.440 --> 01:23.180
As a lady should treat herself once in a while or a gentleman actually.

01:23.180 --> 01:24.180
I had a pedicure once.

01:24.180 --> 01:26.180
I was like, my toenails never looked better.

01:26.180 --> 01:28.860
Well, it's really relaxing though to have someone scrub your feet.

01:28.860 --> 01:30.820
Well, also there's that chair that.

01:30.820 --> 01:31.820
Right.

01:31.820 --> 01:32.820
Yeah.

01:32.820 --> 01:39.500
And the other thing too is that I like that it's, well, the tips of my toes are actually

01:39.500 --> 01:41.900
because I haven't been able to wear anything over my toes.

01:41.900 --> 01:45.600
So the tips of my toes are actually really kind of scuffed up.

01:45.600 --> 01:47.780
So it'll be nice to have like human feet again.

01:47.780 --> 01:52.900
I'm kind of surprised no one has thought of a way to sell like bro-dicures or like target

01:52.900 --> 01:54.660
men in that market somehow.

01:54.660 --> 01:55.660
Like that.

01:55.660 --> 01:56.660
Just call it metricures.

01:56.660 --> 02:00.660
Look, I'm all for, you know, screw your gender norms and all that stuff.

02:00.660 --> 02:05.220
But I understand the reality is most men view it as a girly thing.

02:05.220 --> 02:08.220
But like, what if, what if like you fragile masculine?

02:08.220 --> 02:09.220
I know.

02:09.220 --> 02:10.220
I know.

02:10.220 --> 02:11.220
I know.

02:11.220 --> 02:12.220
Look, that's a whole nother issue.

02:12.220 --> 02:13.220
But the reality is the society we live in.

02:13.220 --> 02:14.220
Right.

02:14.220 --> 02:18.060
So I mean, could, could there be a thing where like you could go like play games, video,

02:18.060 --> 02:21.160
you're like playing Xbox while getting your feet scrubbed?

02:21.160 --> 02:22.160
I don't know.

02:22.160 --> 02:23.160
Yes.

02:23.160 --> 02:25.160
Well, having, you know, a pedicure.

02:25.160 --> 02:28.080
So how many people do text messages when they do it?

02:28.080 --> 02:29.080
Right.

02:29.080 --> 02:30.080
I don't know.

02:30.080 --> 02:31.080
I could just do Pokemon go.

02:31.080 --> 02:32.080
Like I'm doing right now.

02:32.080 --> 02:33.080
All right.

02:33.080 --> 02:34.540
I'm trying to get to level 29.

02:34.540 --> 02:35.540
Tech master.

02:35.540 --> 02:36.540
Loki is here.

02:36.540 --> 02:37.540
Loki, would you get a bro-dicure?

02:37.540 --> 02:38.540
No, no.

02:38.540 --> 02:39.540
Why not?

02:39.540 --> 02:40.540
It's expensive.

02:40.540 --> 02:46.560
I accidentally, I accidentally wandered into like during like jury duty one year, I wandered

02:46.560 --> 02:54.460
into a barbershop that was like a, a men's spa cause me like 40 bucks for a fucking

02:54.460 --> 02:55.460
haircut.

02:55.460 --> 02:56.460
So no thank you.

02:56.460 --> 03:04.240
I just said the only men's spas I know ever the hookup joints, like an upscale, like get

03:04.240 --> 03:09.480
your hair cut, get, you know, your, you know, face shade and stuff like fuck that.

03:09.480 --> 03:12.520
I can just go to the bowling alley that has a barbershop in there and they'll charge you

03:12.520 --> 03:15.360
like $20 for that.

03:15.640 --> 03:19.600
Just as a rule of thumb, Loki, if a men's club is offering a steam room and they're

03:19.600 --> 03:22.840
charging you 40 bucks to get in there, Loki, I don't think it's your cup of tea.

03:22.840 --> 03:25.200
You don't want to go in there.

03:25.200 --> 03:26.200
Duly noted.

03:26.200 --> 03:27.280
All right.

03:27.280 --> 03:28.360
Just a public service.

03:28.360 --> 03:33.400
The advertisements are going to be pretty obvious what, Hey, you never know.

03:33.400 --> 03:34.400
All right.

03:34.400 --> 03:35.400
Going to our chat.

03:35.400 --> 03:36.400
We do tape live.

03:36.400 --> 03:39.120
Of course, believe it or not, it's a video game show and we do tape live every Sunday

03:39.120 --> 03:43.280
night at the voice of geeks network vog network.com six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern

03:43.320 --> 03:47.040
right after the Bobby black Wolf show, although not tonight, he's going through the whole

03:47.040 --> 03:48.040
home transition.

03:48.040 --> 03:49.480
He's talked about on his show.

03:49.480 --> 03:52.280
So he wasn't able to join us tonight, but usually he's there and you can of course check

03:52.280 --> 03:56.280
out his podcast feed or the podcast feed of many of the great shows that we share the

03:56.280 --> 03:57.280
network with.

03:57.280 --> 04:00.320
Like as far as gaming shows go, we have girls gone, wow.

04:00.320 --> 04:02.040
Game buoy electric sisterhood.

04:02.040 --> 04:06.000
And that's just, that's just some of many shows that we have that are great at the voice

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
of geeks network.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.200
So check that out.

04:08.200 --> 04:13.720
Going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, uh, JD and chat says gender is a construct

04:13.720 --> 04:14.720
tear it apart.

04:14.720 --> 04:15.720
Yes.

04:15.720 --> 04:16.720
There you go.

04:16.720 --> 04:17.720
There you go.

04:17.720 --> 04:18.720
Darcy.

04:18.720 --> 04:19.720
Oh, it's not just tearing it apart.

04:19.720 --> 04:20.720
It's disintegration time.

04:20.720 --> 04:23.200
Um, let's see, which was also a great album by the cure.

04:23.200 --> 04:29.800
Speaking of defying gender norms, that was disintegration.

04:29.800 --> 04:30.800
It wasn't disintegration time.

04:30.800 --> 04:34.000
It was, I thought that was an album was disintegration in time.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.800
Oh, I'll look it up now.

04:35.800 --> 04:36.800
All right.

04:37.400 --> 04:38.920
What are you thinking of fascination street?

04:38.920 --> 04:39.920
Am I, I don't know.

04:39.920 --> 04:44.440
Anyway, I'm also looking at an SSG100 Matt who says I had a pedicure once also my toenails

04:44.440 --> 04:45.680
were never cut so well.

04:45.680 --> 04:46.680
Yeah.

04:46.680 --> 04:47.740
It just happens sometimes.

04:47.740 --> 04:49.800
It was just called disintegration.

04:49.800 --> 04:51.400
Athletes get pedicures all the time.

04:51.400 --> 04:54.040
It's better on their feet to have someone work on them regularly.

04:54.040 --> 04:59.120
And yeah, I think, um, certain types of diabetics have to get kind of pro feet treatment.

04:59.120 --> 05:01.360
Also I am too ticklish for any of that.

05:01.360 --> 05:02.360
Are you really?

05:02.360 --> 05:03.360
Yeah, I can't.

05:03.360 --> 05:06.360
That's kind of cute in an awkward way.

05:06.920 --> 05:08.200
So the album was disintegration.

05:08.200 --> 05:09.760
I know my cure albums.

05:09.760 --> 05:12.360
Well I do too, but I knew I had my phase in high school.

05:12.360 --> 05:14.760
I had said disintegration time and that wasn't it.

05:14.760 --> 05:15.760
All right.

05:15.760 --> 05:16.760
Fair enough.

05:16.760 --> 05:17.760
All right.

05:17.760 --> 05:19.560
So anyway, uh, we want to get to the kickoff topic tonight.

05:19.560 --> 05:20.760
Look, it is a video game show.

05:20.760 --> 05:24.440
I want to get to video games because we actually, we have a little bit of a cameo tonight.

05:24.440 --> 05:26.160
I'm going to talk about that in a minute.

05:26.160 --> 05:27.960
And yes, we'll talk about Comic-Con as well.

05:27.960 --> 05:32.040
I know some of y'all are at Comic-Con so there was a few festivals going on this weekend.

05:32.040 --> 05:36.840
So one of them was the Pokemon go festival that was happening in Chicago.

05:36.840 --> 05:42.040
The very first time Niantic was doing an event live based on Pokemon go, but not the first

05:42.040 --> 05:43.040
live Niantic event.

05:43.040 --> 05:48.100
In fact, I feel like maybe I need to get a shirt made that says I survived a successful

05:48.100 --> 05:49.360
Niantic event in Chicago.

05:49.360 --> 05:52.400
You might be confused that this isn't their first event, but yeah.

05:52.400 --> 05:53.400
All right.

05:53.400 --> 05:57.880
Loki from the media perspective, from the news, what's been going on, what's being reported

05:57.880 --> 05:59.400
on out there in the bloggy world.

05:59.400 --> 06:02.400
It was a fucking shit show.

06:02.400 --> 06:05.480
Is that the, is that the official Tom Brokaw line?

06:05.480 --> 06:07.120
Yeah, basically.

06:07.120 --> 06:11.640
So they had problems with it being very unplayable.

06:11.640 --> 06:18.200
Apparently they did not have enough server space available for the players in the area

06:18.200 --> 06:24.080
and it caused them not to be able to catch different Pokemon that were in there or to

06:24.080 --> 06:30.480
battle some of these, you know, legendary Pokemon that they had.

06:30.480 --> 06:33.160
So it was just, it was bad.

06:33.160 --> 06:37.520
I mean, people were chanting, you know, fix the game, you know, that type of stuff.

06:37.520 --> 06:42.600
So did you watch any of the feed on Twitch as it was going on?

06:42.600 --> 06:47.160
I had logged into that like early and they hadn't actually shown anything yet.

06:47.160 --> 06:50.840
And I was like, fuck, this ain't sitting here all day to watch this shit.

06:50.840 --> 06:51.840
Yeah.

06:51.880 --> 06:56.000
It was weird to me how the live stream was on and off, like it was like they would show

06:56.000 --> 06:59.040
something for 10 minutes and then they'd be like, we're just going to show this static

06:59.040 --> 07:03.520
image and you can hear the noises of the festival, but you can't see anything.

07:03.520 --> 07:07.160
Now I had, I probably can't stream it with all the bandwidth.

07:07.160 --> 07:11.960
I guess, I guess now I had always planned on Saturday because they did this whole thing

07:11.960 --> 07:16.200
where they were like, okay, the people at Grant Park are going to be catching Pokemon

07:16.200 --> 07:21.320
and the types of Pokemon that they catch are going to drive these bonuses.

07:21.360 --> 07:25.560
And if everybody else in the world can catch a ton of Pokemon, although they never gave

07:25.560 --> 07:29.240
numbers, if every everybody in the world catches these Pokemon, we're going to roll out these

07:29.240 --> 07:34.280
bonuses for 24, 48 hours and who knows a mystery challenge, which we all fucking know was going

07:34.280 --> 07:35.960
to be legendaries, right?

07:35.960 --> 07:41.280
So I had always planned to go out with a pal downtown and we were going to go catch Pokemon.

07:41.280 --> 07:46.760
And honestly, Saturday when we were out doing Pokemon during the measurement windows of

07:46.760 --> 07:52.200
the event, which was our time, 9 AM to 9 30, then it was like 11, 11 31 to one 30.

07:52.200 --> 07:54.280
So we went to, we didn't really know where to go.

07:54.280 --> 07:56.120
So we were like, let's just go to the Capitol.

07:56.120 --> 07:59.560
Cause that's a really crowded area and it has a ton of pokey stops, right?

07:59.560 --> 08:03.640
So we went down there and there was, there was like a lot of people there playing the

08:03.640 --> 08:04.640
game.

08:04.640 --> 08:10.220
And for all those people that are like, Pokemon go is dead, which I'm sorry, but if you go

08:10.220 --> 08:14.760
to a news site and they're running a headline that says Pokemon go is dead and I'm not going

08:14.760 --> 08:15.760
to name names.

08:15.760 --> 08:16.760
Okay.

08:16.760 --> 08:17.760
I will.

08:17.760 --> 08:18.760
It's Forbes.

08:18.760 --> 08:20.800
But if you're going to go to a site like that, that runs those types of headlines, like you

08:20.800 --> 08:26.800
need to be skeptical about how much this website, um, how would you say it?

08:26.800 --> 08:27.800
Games exaggerates.

08:27.800 --> 08:32.120
I think the gamers that like to exaggerate, when you're looking for your video game news,

08:32.120 --> 08:35.640
do you think first, man, I got to go to Forbes and see what they've had with that.

08:35.640 --> 08:39.600
Well, but Forbes is great at writing real fucking clickbait headlines and I'm, I'm in

08:39.600 --> 08:44.680
a mood today, so I'm calling people out this week and I'm starting with Forbes because

08:44.680 --> 08:45.680
I'm sick.

08:45.680 --> 08:46.680
Yes.

08:46.680 --> 08:47.680
Let the hatred fill.

08:47.680 --> 08:49.820
No, I'm just, I'm fucking sick at the clickbait on that website.

08:49.820 --> 08:51.600
It's not as bad as Motley fool.

08:51.600 --> 08:53.180
That's the fucking worst.

08:53.180 --> 08:59.080
But Forbes has some of the most clickbaity Nintendo hate boner things that they published

08:59.080 --> 09:01.420
just to get Nintendo fans to click on their website.

09:01.420 --> 09:03.200
So I'm just, I'm calling it like it is tonight.

09:03.200 --> 09:04.360
I don't care.

09:04.360 --> 09:11.940
So anyway, so if I see another Forbes article with a link that says Pokemon go is dead,

09:11.940 --> 09:14.740
my eyes are going to roll so far back in my head, I can see my brain.

09:14.740 --> 09:17.260
My point is people are still playing this game.

09:17.260 --> 09:22.460
Is it as many as we're playing it when we had this cultural event back in July of last

09:22.460 --> 09:23.460
year?

09:23.460 --> 09:28.100
No, but is it pretty strong right now, especially compared to maybe three months ago when there

09:28.100 --> 09:29.900
was, you know, not as much going on.

09:29.900 --> 09:30.900
Yeah.

09:30.900 --> 09:31.900
Yeah.

09:31.900 --> 09:34.940
I mean, I think there's a lot of mobile games out there that would love to have what Niantic

09:34.940 --> 09:35.940
has.

09:35.940 --> 09:36.940
Right.

09:37.740 --> 09:42.140
You know, from that perspective of what we were doing downtown, like it was actually

09:42.140 --> 09:43.140
a lot of fun.

09:43.140 --> 09:47.920
The game was running mostly fine except for the fact that the game has a tendency to crash

09:47.920 --> 09:52.780
a lot on my iPhone, which is, I don't know if that's an Niantic issue or a phone issue

09:52.780 --> 09:53.780
or like a phone issue.

09:53.780 --> 09:54.780
I don't know.

09:54.780 --> 09:58.040
Cause my other friends, like it crashes a lot.

09:58.040 --> 09:59.720
Even an Allen, Allen has Android.

09:59.720 --> 10:03.580
I have, I don't play it long enough for the crash maybe, or you don't use the Pogo plus,

10:03.580 --> 10:04.580
which could be one of it.

10:04.580 --> 10:05.580
I don't know.

10:06.220 --> 10:11.340
But anyway, my point is, is that yes, there are still quite a few people playing the game,

10:11.340 --> 10:12.340
right?

10:12.340 --> 10:14.400
So of course there was a great interest in this event.

10:14.400 --> 10:15.780
It sold out very quickly.

10:15.780 --> 10:19.040
They had 20,000 people, some odd that were going to this event.

10:19.040 --> 10:22.940
And so to hear that it turned out like, Oh, I don't know that fire festival that happened

10:22.940 --> 10:26.140
in the Bahamas in some ways was, was pretty disappointing.

10:26.140 --> 10:29.580
At least so unlike that fire festival, they got their money back.

10:29.580 --> 10:31.700
Well, they also weren't trapped on a desert island.

10:31.700 --> 10:32.700
Right.

10:32.700 --> 10:34.420
So, I mean, there's that to be thankful for.

10:34.460 --> 10:38.500
So anyway, here's my thing I could sit here and continue to theorize, well, based on what

10:38.500 --> 10:41.300
I saw or based on what did, this is what must be happening at the festival.

10:41.300 --> 10:46.100
Then I was like, wait a minute, Rob, wait a minute, Rob, you idiot, you know, somebody

10:46.100 --> 10:49.580
that went to Chicago Pokemon go Fest.

10:49.580 --> 10:53.720
Why don't you invite him on the show to talk about what it was really like at Pokemon go

10:53.720 --> 10:54.720
Fest?

10:54.720 --> 10:59.300
Cause you know, there's all this stuff in these publications that tend to games, exaggerate

10:59.300 --> 11:02.860
things or focus on just the worst of it.

11:03.620 --> 11:05.740
There may be some good that went with the bad.

11:05.740 --> 11:11.820
So I reached out to my buddy Charles, also known as rock god of podcast or rock god of

11:11.820 --> 11:13.080
pod on Twitter.

11:13.080 --> 11:17.420
He is one of the hosts of the Pokemon go podcast, which is a show I plugged here a couple weeks

11:17.420 --> 11:19.780
ago cause they were good enough to have me on it.

11:19.780 --> 11:24.540
So I reached out to Charles, unfortunately he had another paying gig tonight so he could

11:24.540 --> 11:26.440
not be here on the show live.

11:26.440 --> 11:28.120
So we had to kind of work real fast.

11:28.120 --> 11:35.560
He sent us a really lengthy audio clip explaining like his time at the festival.

11:35.560 --> 11:39.080
Unfortunately I wanted to scale it back a little bit cause it was, you know, it is only

11:39.080 --> 11:40.080
a three hour show here.

11:40.080 --> 11:41.360
So I wanted to scale it back a little bit.

11:41.360 --> 11:45.760
So I kind of cut out some of these parts that I want you guys to hear here.

11:45.760 --> 11:50.600
So let's check in with, Oh, but if the audio is a little weird, it's because I edited it

11:50.600 --> 11:51.700
like an hour ago.

11:51.700 --> 11:54.540
So if there's any sloppiness, it's on my part.

11:54.540 --> 11:57.360
So I apologize to Charles and to listeners for that.

11:57.520 --> 12:01.720
Let's check in with Charles and check and see how his day kind of started over there

12:01.720 --> 12:02.720
in Chicago.

12:02.720 --> 12:06.680
Hey Rob, Jamie and Loki at Orange Lounge Radio.

12:06.680 --> 12:11.200
It's the rock out of podcasting Charles Mcfall from Pokemon Go podcast.

12:11.200 --> 12:14.640
And let me tell you what it was really like being there at Pokemon Go Fest.

12:14.640 --> 12:20.800
Now line started at 6 AM and there were people out there, I'm sure at 6 AM, lined up.

12:20.800 --> 12:25.240
Myself and the people I was traveling with, we walked from the hood that was about two

12:25.240 --> 12:27.000
blocks away from the park.

12:27.000 --> 12:33.240
And so we were walking down and as we came up on the park, there's this massive line

12:33.240 --> 12:36.600
stretched out and we're like, Oh crap.

12:36.600 --> 12:39.500
Because a lot of people, we had somebody standing in line for us for the early entry.

12:39.500 --> 12:45.140
We did have early entry badges, which were supposed to get you in starting at 9 AM.

12:45.140 --> 12:48.200
The general public started at 10 AM.

12:48.200 --> 12:52.900
And the line, basically the short version is, that line was not for early entry.

12:52.900 --> 12:57.000
That was for the regular entry people and it was already super long.

12:57.000 --> 13:04.180
We got in, say 9.30, it took us about 30-ish minutes to make it around the fence and into

13:04.180 --> 13:05.180
the entranceway.

13:05.180 --> 13:08.740
And they were checking bags in, but it was honestly, they weren't checking them that

13:08.740 --> 13:09.740
much.

13:09.740 --> 13:10.740
They were just kind of moving people through.

13:10.740 --> 13:16.740
Got in and everybody, we're all hyped, everybody's excited and you get this envelope, as you

13:16.740 --> 13:20.940
walk in the door, you're handed an envelope and it has a real world patch that is the

13:20.940 --> 13:26.600
exact same thing that you get in the game that's the medal in the game for being there

13:26.600 --> 13:28.460
is a patch version of the medal.

13:28.460 --> 13:33.500
And on the other side is a QR code and you had to go to any stop inside the park that

13:33.500 --> 13:39.700
had a lot of temporary cool stops, which, and gyms, which tells us they can absolutely

13:39.700 --> 13:46.100
do the stop slash gym for pay idea that we've been talking about on our show forever.

13:46.100 --> 13:49.700
Anyway, and right down the middle as you come in is all the concessions and everything.

13:49.700 --> 13:54.940
It was really actually, I'm going to say from a functional human being standpoint,

13:54.940 --> 13:57.100
they did an amazing job setting this up.

13:57.100 --> 14:01.720
It was easy to find the food, they had water stations, they had at least two if not three

14:01.720 --> 14:04.900
water stations around to get you free water.

14:04.900 --> 14:08.700
So you brought your own bottle, you can bring in two bottles of water sealed or empty pouches

14:08.700 --> 14:13.140
or, and they actually didn't really think that strict about it.

14:13.140 --> 14:19.260
The price is, I expected eight to ten dollars per person to eat and I'm talking about, you

14:19.300 --> 14:23.820
know, you go to a festival and you're talking about, hey, pizza, pizza is ten bucks, water

14:23.820 --> 14:31.300
is five dollars, don't you, no, my pizza, my honest to God, real Chicago restaurant,

14:31.300 --> 14:34.620
you know, they made it in the restaurant and brought it to the park very quickly.

14:34.620 --> 14:37.140
It was still hot when it got there.

14:37.140 --> 14:43.180
Real Chicago slice pizza, now hold up my fingers like you can see me, but a big huge triangle,

14:43.180 --> 14:46.500
five bucks, five bucks, a bottle of water was like two dollars.

14:46.500 --> 14:48.860
It was insanely cheap to be there.

14:48.860 --> 14:50.060
That was really cool.

14:50.060 --> 14:54.220
Let me jump, let me, let me jump in here for a minute to talk about some of what Charles

14:54.220 --> 14:55.740
said there.

14:55.740 --> 14:58.380
And obviously, sorry about some of the audio there.

14:58.380 --> 15:02.200
There's some tearing effects in audio and the audio that we got sent.

15:02.200 --> 15:06.760
But my understanding is that Charles like actually recorded that in a car in a parking

15:06.760 --> 15:08.680
lot on the way to one of his gigs.

15:08.680 --> 15:11.800
So really appreciate him taking the time out to do that.

15:11.800 --> 15:15.720
But some of the audio was a little shaky, I didn't have time to clean it, clean it up.

15:16.520 --> 15:19.260
On that note, I noticed there was some bad and there was some good in there.

15:19.260 --> 15:20.600
So it sounds like Charles was fortunate.

15:20.600 --> 15:22.780
He had this early entry thing and a buddy.

15:22.780 --> 15:24.860
So he got into this thing early.

15:24.860 --> 15:28.720
But there was this huge line, you guys all saw this on the media and some of the Twitter,

15:28.720 --> 15:29.720
right?

15:29.720 --> 15:34.960
There was this huge line, sorry, this huge line going around the whole place that was

15:34.960 --> 15:37.040
it was hard for people to get in and stuff, right?

15:37.040 --> 15:40.960
So I mean, it was taking like forever for people to get into this place.

15:40.960 --> 15:44.400
And what blew my mind about it is that it sounded like from what Charles is saying there,

15:44.400 --> 15:45.520
they really weren't doing much.

15:45.520 --> 15:49.480
They weren't really like scanning the bags that deeply or whatever.

15:49.480 --> 15:50.600
So what was taking so long?

15:50.600 --> 15:52.400
And here's the other thing.

15:52.400 --> 15:55.900
So now comparing Charles's experience to my experience a little bit when I went to Niantic's

15:55.900 --> 16:00.520
Ingress anomaly over Veterans Day weekend last year when I missed the show.

16:00.520 --> 16:01.520
That's where I was at.

16:01.520 --> 16:03.600
I was at a Niantic event in Chicago.

16:03.600 --> 16:09.240
They did check ins the night before for the Ingress event, you were able to go to a bar

16:09.240 --> 16:14.320
that was in the downtown area and you could check in at the bar the night before and get

16:14.320 --> 16:15.320
your stuff.

16:15.320 --> 16:17.200
And then, you know, we all went to the anomaly.

16:17.200 --> 16:22.000
Now granted, I understand there was maybe 1,500 people that did the Ingress event compared

16:22.000 --> 16:23.320
to what, 20,000.

16:23.320 --> 16:25.320
So I obviously understand the size.

16:25.320 --> 16:28.560
Which I think would be all the more reason they have to check in the night before.

16:28.560 --> 16:32.120
That's what blew my mind is I was like, why didn't they do check ins the night before?

16:32.120 --> 16:36.320
Were they that concerned about resales, spoofers?

16:36.320 --> 16:40.600
I don't know what it was, but it really blew my mind that like for this smaller event Niantic

16:40.600 --> 16:44.240
did something, but then for this larger event they didn't.

16:44.240 --> 16:47.800
But then Charles does point out there is some good stuff that you're not hearing about in

16:47.800 --> 16:48.800
these news stories.

16:48.800 --> 16:53.480
It sounds like from a functional standpoint, you know, the vendors were reasonable and

16:53.480 --> 16:56.560
they weren't trying to price gouge people or any of that stuff.

16:56.560 --> 17:01.320
And that, you know, as far as like a, am I going to get food and water situation?

17:01.320 --> 17:02.320
It was fine.

17:02.320 --> 17:05.600
Unlike, you know, even though we're joking about Fire Festival, those people that were

17:05.600 --> 17:09.180
trapped in the Bahamas were having a food and water situation as well, which is a lot

17:09.180 --> 17:10.180
more serious.

17:10.220 --> 17:15.540
But it sounds like that was never an issue with the Pokemon Go Fest and that that was

17:15.540 --> 17:16.720
doing very well.

17:16.720 --> 17:19.140
So let me continue on with another clip from Charles.

17:19.140 --> 17:24.540
And so we get over this all at 930 in the morning and we get over there and I'm spending

17:24.540 --> 17:27.100
some stuff and the game starts kind of getting clunky.

17:27.100 --> 17:31.060
I'm trying to go into a raid and I'm like, well, I'm going to fight this Pikachu raid.

17:31.060 --> 17:33.820
Raid battles were free all day long.

17:33.820 --> 17:36.020
Did not take any passes at all.

17:36.020 --> 17:40.220
Raid battles inside the park, 100% free.

17:40.220 --> 17:41.220
And they were doing them.

17:41.220 --> 17:46.500
They would be a 10 minute warning time, like a regular start in 10 minutes and then pop

17:46.500 --> 17:49.580
into 14 minute uptime.

17:49.580 --> 17:51.700
And they had gyms.

17:51.700 --> 17:54.260
I think they had eight gyms in there.

17:54.260 --> 17:58.340
So there's plenty of places for people to play and get to.

17:58.340 --> 18:01.900
And I started to do the Pikachu raid and I hit the thing and put me in a room and it

18:01.900 --> 18:05.180
kind of locked and didn't do anything and the game crashed.

18:05.180 --> 18:07.460
And somebody else was like, I can't get the QR code work.

18:07.460 --> 18:11.060
They were having issues and they finally got theirs to work.

18:11.060 --> 18:12.980
And that's at 930 in the morning.

18:12.980 --> 18:18.880
So already it's like, hmm, at 10 o'clock, I don't know when they actually started the

18:18.880 --> 18:20.860
actual public coming in.

18:20.860 --> 18:24.760
They had a big enough gate that you could funnel both lines in easily.

18:24.760 --> 18:29.900
But the thing is that nine o'clock early band, they gave out way too many of those bands

18:29.900 --> 18:37.820
because at 1030, almost 11 on the backside of the park, I mean, the line would be super,

18:37.820 --> 18:38.820
super long.

18:38.820 --> 18:43.220
People were still there and we didn't go up and ask, are you in the early entry line?

18:43.220 --> 18:49.860
But this is, this is at 11 o'clock almost, no, it is about 1030, I guess it's about 1030.

18:49.860 --> 18:53.940
And the early entry quotey fingers people seem to be still lined up and trying to come

18:53.940 --> 18:55.300
in.

18:55.300 --> 18:59.020
I've heard that it took three hours of standing in line.

18:59.140 --> 19:04.980
I'm not talking about the early guy here at 6 a.m. people from the time 10 o'clock hit,

19:04.980 --> 19:10.300
it took three hours to get through the general public line and get into the park.

19:10.300 --> 19:12.940
But that's, that was frustrating for a lot of people.

19:12.940 --> 19:15.700
And I was tweeting that we had some friends who did not get early passes that were in

19:15.700 --> 19:19.380
the general and they were tweeting, they spoke among their radio.

19:19.380 --> 19:23.460
And we're telling them, you're not missing anything, we can't play, nothing's connecting

19:23.460 --> 19:24.460
here.

19:24.900 --> 19:28.220
1030, 11, maybe it's closer to 11.

19:28.220 --> 19:31.580
They said, all right, everybody come to the main stage, we're gonna kick this thing off.

19:31.580 --> 19:34.660
And I'm looking around the house like, there's only maybe a thousand people in the park right

19:34.660 --> 19:35.660
now.

19:35.660 --> 19:36.660
Maybe two.

19:36.660 --> 19:37.660
I mean, it's always a huge open space.

19:37.660 --> 19:41.660
It's hard to kind of gauge how many people are in, but like, of the 20,000 people supposed

19:41.660 --> 19:45.100
to be here, you haven't gotten very many in the park yet.

19:45.100 --> 19:50.100
What's interesting about that is that watching the live feed, I would not have guessed that

19:50.100 --> 19:52.140
they had not filled the park yet.

19:52.140 --> 19:56.380
In fact, my thought was, I'm hearing all this stuff on Twitter about all these people stuck

19:56.380 --> 19:58.260
in line, which Charles talks about there.

19:58.260 --> 20:03.500
Can you imagine you travel from California, and some people came further, you travel from

20:03.500 --> 20:08.220
California to Chicago to go to the first Pokemon Go event only to stand in line for three hours

20:08.220 --> 20:12.980
and know that you're missing the first event inside the park, even though punchline, no

20:12.980 --> 20:17.140
one in the park can play either, but the people outside may not actually know that.

20:17.140 --> 20:19.860
So can you imagine how frustrated like people are gonna be at this event?

20:19.860 --> 20:23.820
And this is why things started to get ugly, which we're gonna hear about in a little bit.

20:23.820 --> 20:29.180
But with the whole, you know, what Charles is talking about with the lines and everything,

20:29.180 --> 20:35.380
I mean, again, I'm blown away that Niantic did not have line management for 20,000 people,

20:35.380 --> 20:40.260
and then it took three hours for people to get into this event, which was part of the

20:40.260 --> 20:41.920
ugliness to begin with, right?

20:41.920 --> 20:45.780
So again, why didn't they do check-ins the day before for some people, and why didn't

20:45.780 --> 20:48.700
they have more staff, more points of entry?

20:48.700 --> 20:50.340
It should be simple math, right?

20:50.340 --> 20:52.340
How long it's gonna take one person to process...

20:52.340 --> 20:54.340
They know how many tickets they sold.

20:54.340 --> 20:58.420
Well, yeah, they know exactly how many tickets they sold, and so they should know how long

20:58.420 --> 21:00.180
it's gonna take to process those people.

21:00.180 --> 21:01.180
That blows me away.

21:01.180 --> 21:05.220
I mean, I know a lot of anime conventions and stuff have long waits sometimes, but,

21:05.220 --> 21:07.180
you know, again, a lot of rookie mistakes.

21:07.180 --> 21:08.580
Cough Cough Anime Expo.

21:08.580 --> 21:12.700
Well, a lot of rookie mistakes sometimes with this stuff.

21:12.700 --> 21:19.100
I remember Square Enix's first Final Fantasy Fan Fest in 2014 was a huge problem because

21:19.100 --> 21:23.840
they had a printer break, and they didn't have a backup printer.

21:23.840 --> 21:27.300
So all those people had to wait while somebody, like, ran to Office Depot to get a printer

21:27.300 --> 21:28.300
or something like that.

21:28.300 --> 21:29.380
It was crazy.

21:29.380 --> 21:34.100
So anyway, I don't know if there was more stuff like that at Pokemon Go Fest or what.

21:34.100 --> 21:39.100
Anyway, I did cut some stuff here about, Charles was talking about some of the, like, shirts

21:39.100 --> 21:42.760
and things they were selling in the park were not a great quality.

21:42.760 --> 21:46.420
Like they just weren't even selling Team Valor or anything.

21:46.420 --> 21:50.060
Apparently the bootleggers outside, because you know there's always bootleggers, bootleggers

21:50.060 --> 21:53.140
had better stuff from what Charles was saying.

21:53.140 --> 21:57.020
But I want to get to this next clip because Charles says something here that I think is

21:57.020 --> 22:01.500
really damning for the whole excuse Niantic is giving us.

22:01.500 --> 22:02.500
So listen up.

22:02.500 --> 22:08.100
If people start chanting, we can't log in, we can't connect, or something like that.

22:08.100 --> 22:10.140
I forget what the chant was.

22:10.140 --> 22:13.900
But they're yelling at her, and she's ignoring it, and the first person she introduced is

22:13.900 --> 22:14.900
John Hanke.

22:14.900 --> 22:15.900
And people are, boo!

22:15.900 --> 22:21.460
They're like, no, no, we understand, things are, you know, we're working on it.

22:21.460 --> 22:26.980
He handled it well, but I mean there was somebody so loud up front yelling at him that was coming

22:26.980 --> 22:30.700
through the microphone a little bit and back out to the PA so we could kind of hear it.

22:30.700 --> 22:35.740
And he handled it like a pro, I mean he took his punches, but they were like, you know,

22:35.740 --> 22:36.740
but he did.

22:36.740 --> 22:38.580
And that was a major mistake to me.

22:38.580 --> 22:44.260
Oh no, we're contacting the cell places, and I'm going, in my mind, I'm going, okay, and

22:44.260 --> 22:47.860
actually I said this to the people around me, here's the bottom line on the cell service,

22:47.860 --> 22:54.380
you'll hear all kinds of rumors about contract obligations, blah, blah, bullshit.

22:54.380 --> 23:01.740
Here's the thing, now in the real world there are absolutely coverage areas, right?

23:01.740 --> 23:06.700
So some parts of the park had much better service with Verizon than in other parts of

23:06.740 --> 23:07.740
the park.

23:07.740 --> 23:11.300
But that was true for AT&T, you know, it all kind of covered a little differently.

23:11.300 --> 23:16.140
But here was the thing, even at that point, there's maybe, like I said, maybe 2,000 people

23:16.140 --> 23:22.860
at the most, which would not overload any cell tower anywhere.

23:22.860 --> 23:27.340
And they're like, yeah, we're working with them, you can see that, notice your servers,

23:27.340 --> 23:31.740
because I can livestream, which I did, I did some livestreams right there from the park,

23:31.740 --> 23:36.580
I can Twitter, I can get my messages, I can get on Discord, I can open up another game

23:36.580 --> 23:42.020
and play it, I can do all kinds of stuff on my phone that touches the internet, but

23:42.020 --> 23:44.540
I cannot play your game.

23:44.540 --> 23:50.820
I can Twitter, I can Discord, I can livestream, do you know how much bandwidth it takes to

23:50.820 --> 23:54.020
livestream but I can't play your game?

23:54.020 --> 24:01.260
And you're going to go blame the cell towers as the issue, but I can livestream, huh, isn't

24:01.260 --> 24:02.260
that funny?

24:02.460 --> 24:08.100
Maybe if he wasn't livestreaming, they'd have enough bandwidth for the game.

24:08.100 --> 24:11.300
Damn it, Charles, you broke the whole damn thing.

24:11.300 --> 24:13.300
You single-handedly broke Go Fest with your livestream.

24:13.300 --> 24:17.220
No, I'm not surprised that their servers are crap.

24:17.220 --> 24:21.020
But I mean, and I think Charles brings this up, and I think it's in something that I cut

24:21.020 --> 24:25.560
out, but he brings up that, you know, Dragon Con, 80,000 people, people play this game

24:25.560 --> 24:29.180
at Disneyland every day, they don't have problems.

24:29.180 --> 24:33.180
It was something about what they were doing with this event and the restrictions they

24:33.180 --> 24:38.460
were putting on this event, some of the graphical issues of the game, and just the poor optimization

24:38.460 --> 24:43.560
I guess all around of the game, really, in some ways, it kind of all contributed to this.

24:43.560 --> 24:49.020
But to blame the cell networks when people are able to be on Twitter, livestream, tell

24:49.020 --> 24:52.700
the rest of the internet what a shitty time they're having, that's a little disingenuous.

24:52.700 --> 24:57.980
Yeah, I can understand if they couldn't, if internet access was a problem, that would

24:57.980 --> 25:02.740
make more sense, but that's not the case, especially when it's only your game, that's

25:02.740 --> 25:03.820
not working.

25:03.820 --> 25:07.100
So here was the first thing I thought of, the first thing I thought of when I heard

25:07.100 --> 25:12.780
all of this was going down yesterday was, why didn't they just have Wi-Fi?

25:12.780 --> 25:18.220
And granted, 20,000 people is probably a lot to have on Wi-Fi, but they do it at airports

25:18.220 --> 25:23.500
somehow, and you know, I'm sure at least even if they, let's say they could only get, maybe

25:23.500 --> 25:27.720
the VIP people that got in early also got the Wi-Fi, I don't know.

25:27.720 --> 25:33.320
So maybe 2,000 people get on Wi-Fi, well that's still 10% off the rest of this if you're

25:33.320 --> 25:37.180
going to blame the networks, which I'm not so sure, obviously based off the livestreaming

25:37.180 --> 25:38.440
comment that it really is.

25:38.440 --> 25:41.440
But still, I think that question, why wasn't there Wi-Fi?

25:41.440 --> 25:43.240
Well, Charles has an answer.

25:43.240 --> 25:48.040
They did not have the Wi-Fi as promised, but there was, I heard, again, these are quote

25:48.040 --> 25:52.480
rumors, they didn't announce this, but I heard that because of the massive rainstorms that

25:52.480 --> 25:56.640
came through on Friday, and there were massive rainstorms on Friday, I guess so, a little

25:56.680 --> 26:01.040
bit Friday night, they weren't able to set up the Wi-Fi stuff, and it was even raining

26:01.040 --> 26:05.760
a little bit Saturday morning, but then the sun came out by 9 o'clock and it was gorgeous

26:05.760 --> 26:07.240
all day.

26:07.240 --> 26:13.040
Anyway, so they did the hunt, and most people can't do it, so then they call everybody back

26:13.040 --> 26:21.040
to the stage, and now it's worse, people are booing and yelling, and finally she just stopped

26:21.240 --> 26:26.640
talking and just left the stage, that was it, she basically got booed off the stage.

26:26.640 --> 26:30.520
And so we started milling around, so the rest of the day is much shorter than that first

26:30.520 --> 26:35.920
part of the story, the rest of the day, things got better, I ended up, I couldn't play at

26:35.920 --> 26:41.720
all until, I mean, like I said, I was there at 9.30, couldn't play at all until 12.30,

26:41.720 --> 26:44.640
and the only way I could play there, I call it the filthy casual mode, right, you just

26:44.640 --> 26:50.640
turn on your plus, or for me the gotcha, which is even more filthy casual, because it's automatic,

26:50.640 --> 26:53.200
and that's it, you don't play the game, you just let it run in the background and see

26:53.200 --> 26:55.440
what it spins, what it catches.

26:55.440 --> 26:59.440
That became the only way for me to play, I could get my game to come up just long enough

26:59.440 --> 27:04.840
to connect it to my gotcha and then close the screen, and it would start throwing regular

27:04.840 --> 27:06.840
pokeballs at whatever was around me.

27:06.840 --> 27:09.520
A lot of things were getting better, people were getting pissed, but here's the thing,

27:09.520 --> 27:15.800
the line to get out, so they had an in and out policy, and you had to do your wristband,

27:15.800 --> 27:21.240
you boop it out, as I say, you just boop, and you're out, and they stamped you too apparently,

27:21.240 --> 27:24.920
but then you can come back in, and you boop back in.

27:24.920 --> 27:32.800
The line to leave was so long, people were just staying out of frustration, because it

27:32.800 --> 27:36.920
was taking you an hour to try to even get out of the park, you might as well just stay,

27:36.920 --> 27:40.240
but some of the experience, the dream that we were sold, right, of everybody playing

27:40.240 --> 27:45.000
together and doing this, some of that absolutely was present, because I'm standing on the sidewalk

27:45.000 --> 27:53.680
and all of a sudden the crowd politely, some kind of run, nobody's pushing, nobody's, but

27:53.680 --> 27:57.400
nobody's pushing, everybody's polite, and they move en masse to this area, and they're

27:57.400 --> 27:58.440
like, what's going on?

27:58.440 --> 28:03.760
There's a Heracross over here, and you get to hear people are trying to get, oh yeah,

28:03.760 --> 28:08.320
oh my god, I got it, oh no, oh no, oh no, wait, you know, that experience was absolutely

28:08.320 --> 28:11.440
in small droves there.

28:11.440 --> 28:16.720
And you know, I've been feeling a lot of that this weekend, too, throughout Pokemon Go,

28:16.720 --> 28:21.120
because now that they've unleashed those legendaries, you know, if you didn't already hear, you

28:21.120 --> 28:26.240
can get Lugia and Articuno, but I might be saying that wrong, because I thought it was

28:26.240 --> 28:30.760
Arctic, anyway, but those legendaries are out there, and you can go catch them now,

28:30.760 --> 28:34.720
and I got to tell you, I've had some really rad experiences, like, you know, I got at

28:34.720 --> 28:40.480
a Discord and an Articuno spawn year here, and met up with some other people, people

28:40.520 --> 28:46.360
I didn't know, but other nerds from all, all types of people, men, women, all different

28:46.360 --> 28:50.960
shapes, sizes, colors, all that, just wanting to get their damn legendary in their Pokedex,

28:50.960 --> 28:54.680
and that was really cool, to kind of like come together and do that, and then we played

28:54.680 --> 28:58.720
some more, in fact, I almost, I almost killed myself playing Pokemon Go today, because I

28:58.720 --> 29:02.160
was an idiot, and they've been doing all these bonuses all weekend, like the double, well

29:02.160 --> 29:05.080
not all weekend, but since the event, the double Stardust and everything, I thought

29:05.080 --> 29:09.120
it would be a good idea to go play Pokemon Go in the 100 degree heat today, even though

29:09.160 --> 29:12.800
yes, I had sunblock, yes, I was hydrating myself, but it was still maybe a little bit

29:12.800 --> 29:17.960
much, but anyway, I'm okay, I didn't pass out, like I thought I was going to for a minute,

29:17.960 --> 29:23.200
but we, I was even able to do the Lusia fight, we won it, and there was like, there was 40

29:23.200 --> 29:27.680
people there, in the middle of downtown Roseville, doing this Lusia fight, when these things

29:27.680 --> 29:33.520
are spawning everywhere right now, 40 people in the middle of a suburb, just there to do

29:33.520 --> 29:38.240
this stupid game, so I mean, some of that that's been happening is, is really awesome,

29:38.240 --> 29:43.480
so it's, it's kind of a bummer that Niantic is still like, I guess too small of a company

29:43.480 --> 29:48.880
or something to figure out some of these technical issues, because the game they've got is fucking

29:48.880 --> 29:56.160
great, when it works, which unfortunately is only about half the time, and I gotta say

29:56.160 --> 30:02.320
too, because some of our folks in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, let's see, over at

30:02.320 --> 30:07.200
live.vognetwork.com, they're talking about the host, I guess her name is Rachel Seltzer,

30:07.200 --> 30:13.200
I don't know her, but vidpower in chat says she's an esports commentator, and probably

30:13.200 --> 30:16.840
what Charles doesn't know, being on the ground, if he was a little far back from the stage,

30:16.840 --> 30:20.200
but what you could see on the live stream, I think she left the stage because someone

30:20.200 --> 30:23.680
threw a shoe at her, or a bottle or something at her, and it wasn't safe to be out there,

30:23.680 --> 30:29.920
and I think that's the real reason she left, which, you know, I understand people are pissed,

30:29.920 --> 30:33.480
but that's a shitty thing to do, and if you threw that, you should feel bad, because you're

30:33.480 --> 30:38.840
a bad person, you know, because do you think she's the one that, like, went and unplugged

30:38.840 --> 30:40.040
the AT&T van?

30:40.040 --> 30:41.040
Do you think that was her idea?

30:41.040 --> 30:42.040
No.

30:42.040 --> 30:43.960
Especially if it's a shoe, because now you're missing a shoe.

30:43.960 --> 30:47.200
I think it was a bottle, I don't think, I always assume a rock concert or something

30:47.200 --> 30:51.080
is a shoe, but whatever it was, whatever they fucking threw at her, it's not okay, it's

30:51.080 --> 30:57.360
not cool, and look, I get that she was a little cheesy, I understand that, I did feel a little

30:57.360 --> 31:00.440
bit like, wow, tone it down, honey, but...

31:00.440 --> 31:03.160
Can we stop having influencers at these events, please?

31:03.160 --> 31:07.080
I think it's part that, it's part influencers, but then I also have to remember, there are

31:07.080 --> 31:11.520
a lot of children that play Pokemon Go, and if you ever turn on Nickelodeon, you see a

31:11.520 --> 31:15.760
lot of people that are like her, so I kind of have to, like, go, okay, maybe, maybe she's

31:15.760 --> 31:21.180
not for me, she's for the kids, and, you know, whatever, but I also kind of agree that influencers

31:21.180 --> 31:26.080
as hosts, I don't know about that, but anyway, that's, that's another debate for another

31:26.080 --> 31:27.080
time.

31:28.080 --> 31:32.120
I want to get to the final thought here, I do want to caution, this last clip does have

31:32.120 --> 31:35.000
a little bit of audio tearing in it, but I did think it was important for Charles to

31:35.000 --> 31:38.840
get his final thoughts out here in this clip from being on the ground at Pokemon Go Fest.

31:38.840 --> 31:45.240
But this is the last thing I'll say, is, how do they not understand the effing tech that

31:45.240 --> 31:46.240
goes into this?

31:46.240 --> 31:50.720
How do you understand, I get on launch, you never anticipated this, but you know at this

31:50.720 --> 31:56.560
point, what happens when you go into a new country, all of a sudden, damn, you're flooded,

31:57.040 --> 32:01.240
you launch a brand new thing like the gym revamp, bam, things kind of break, and that's

32:01.240 --> 32:06.720
tech, I get that, but when you're doing a festival, you had to have had this stuff launched

32:06.720 --> 32:09.800
two weeks ago in the code.

32:09.800 --> 32:16.920
I don't care if it's, I don't care about data miners, you had to have this launched two

32:16.920 --> 32:21.960
weeks ago, so you could have beta tested it in your office, just made your office a special

32:21.960 --> 32:27.640
playground, you know, with that geo-locking, worked it out, got triple the amount of servers

32:27.640 --> 32:33.600
you're going to need, paid whatever you had to pay to all the cell providers to make sure

32:33.600 --> 32:38.800
they were boosting signal or whatever, it just was frustrating that they don't seem

32:38.800 --> 32:43.840
to ever understand how this tech works, and how it affects the community, but lots of

32:43.840 --> 32:47.400
people were happy, met a lot of strangers, talked to a lot of people, and it was a lot

32:47.400 --> 32:48.400
of fun.

32:48.400 --> 32:52.960
I really do, I left there, especially with getting, knowing I was going to get the lugia

32:52.960 --> 33:01.960
anyway, leaving there, I left feeling good, and I feel like this year's going to be a

33:01.960 --> 33:06.200
hard learning curve for them, but if they really are committed to doing this again,

33:06.200 --> 33:11.960
doing more, they're really going to have to hire some massive event planners that do outside

33:11.960 --> 33:12.960
events.

33:12.960 --> 33:15.880
I mean, I'm talking about big companies that are going to cost you some money, but they

33:15.880 --> 33:20.120
know exactly what to do, and then really get their servers right.

33:20.120 --> 33:21.120
So that's it.

33:21.120 --> 33:27.400
I'm Charles with Polymer, I've got a podcast, and check out Pokemon Go Podcast at PokemonGoPodcast.com,

33:27.400 --> 33:30.760
and we're here, and we're honored to have Rob on a couple of weeks ago, got lots of

33:30.760 --> 33:35.800
great feedback from you, man, everybody's loved you, so definitely come back again.

33:35.800 --> 33:38.680
I absolutely will, Charles, and thank you so much for leaving that.

33:38.680 --> 33:44.140
Again, I had to edit down a 27-minute message down to the 10 or 11 minutes we played here,

33:44.140 --> 33:47.180
but Charles took time out of his day to leave that for us, and I really, really appreciate

33:47.180 --> 33:50.540
that, especially with such a fast turnaround, because I literally messaged him last night,

33:50.540 --> 33:53.780
like, we should really get you on OLR this week since you were there, and I want to know

33:53.780 --> 33:54.820
what it was like on the ground.

33:54.820 --> 33:56.580
So thank you, Charles, for leaving that message for us.

33:56.580 --> 33:59.080
Everybody check out Pokemon Go Podcast.

33:59.080 --> 34:03.900
He will tell much more about a lot more of the details on that program, but I want to

34:03.900 --> 34:08.260
thank him for giving us a little preview here.

34:08.260 --> 34:12.740
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Land Radio at vognetwork.com,

34:12.740 --> 34:15.420
use the passphrase, bread.

34:42.740 --> 34:47.380
I've got to come a point where I have to give Niantic a little tough love, and it's time

34:47.380 --> 34:51.220
for Niantic to grow the fuck up or sell.

34:51.220 --> 34:55.780
Like this, from my perspective, this is the crossroads, Niantic is that, and this festival

34:55.780 --> 34:57.660
kind of only proves that for me.

34:57.660 --> 35:01.900
They either need to grow the fuck up, meaning they're going to have to get the bodies in

35:01.900 --> 35:06.620
there, they're going to have to get the investors or the people, or somehow raise the funds

35:06.620 --> 35:11.860
to get the staffing and be the large company that a game like Pokemon Go needs, or sell

35:11.860 --> 35:13.900
to a company who can do it.

35:13.900 --> 35:17.660
Because after this whole thing happened, my honest to God first reaction, I heard they

35:17.660 --> 35:20.580
went up on stage and said, everybody's getting a refund and we're going to give out a hundred

35:20.580 --> 35:21.980
dollars in pokey coins.

35:21.980 --> 35:25.620
My honest to God reaction was, they're going to be sold next week.

35:25.620 --> 35:30.300
Niantic's going to be forced to sell to somebody next week to a company who can handle the

35:30.300 --> 35:31.300
infrastructure.

35:31.300 --> 35:32.860
God, please don't sell the Nintendo.

35:32.860 --> 35:35.060
They can't handle the infrastructure.

35:35.060 --> 35:38.540
Here's the weird thing, Niantic was a Google company.

35:38.540 --> 35:42.620
The only reason Niantic is no longer a Google company is because Google did that whole alphabet

35:42.620 --> 35:46.300
split that they did a couple years ago, and Niantic was kind of left out of that, but

35:46.300 --> 35:50.220
that was because they had the backing from Nintendo now.

35:50.220 --> 35:52.220
But we didn't know that at the time, we know it now.

35:52.220 --> 35:55.460
They had the backing from Nintendo, and Google is still a major backer in this.

35:55.460 --> 36:00.900
So I sort of think it would make a lot of sense for Google to kind of bring them back,

36:00.900 --> 36:06.220
but at the same time, there's a lot of business elements there that I will fully admit I don't

36:06.220 --> 36:12.900
understand, but I just feel like after the disaster that happened in Chicago, something's

36:12.900 --> 36:14.000
got to give.

36:14.000 --> 36:19.540
This game has got to grow the fuck up, because there's a lot of potential in this game that

36:19.540 --> 36:27.340
keeps getting ruined by technical things that can't be handled, and again, I think one of

36:27.340 --> 36:32.060
the most damning things is what Charles pointed out there, the whole fact that Niantic is

36:32.060 --> 36:36.500
trying to blame the cell phone companies, yet I was live streaming.

36:36.500 --> 36:37.500
I was tweeting.

36:37.500 --> 36:40.600
I was on Discord.

36:40.600 --> 36:42.180
It's not the cell phone companies.

36:42.180 --> 36:45.180
It's your game.

36:45.180 --> 36:46.180
Any thoughts, Loki?

36:46.180 --> 36:49.300
I know you're a Pokemon, Dark Soccer, anything you guys want to add based on what Charles

36:49.300 --> 36:51.380
said and your thoughts on the event?

36:51.380 --> 36:52.380
I don't know.

36:52.380 --> 36:59.820
I played a little bit this weekend while I was at a park with my kids, and I was expecting

36:59.820 --> 37:01.740
some different spawns.

37:01.740 --> 37:07.460
I got a Poliwag or whatever that is, which I thought was a water Pokemon, so it was kind

37:07.460 --> 37:11.620
of weird that it was spawning that park.

37:11.620 --> 37:15.180
But yeah, other than that, I was like, eh, I don't want to play this anymore.

37:15.180 --> 37:18.380
Let me get to some comments from our chat over at live.vognetwork.com, because of course

37:18.380 --> 37:22.100
we do tape live Sunday nights at 6 Pacific 9 Eastern at vognetwork.com.

37:22.100 --> 37:27.420
JD over in chat says, how many chances are we going to continue to give Niantic to get

37:27.420 --> 37:28.420
their shit together?

37:28.420 --> 37:32.500
They have clearly demonstrated that they learned absolutely nothing from the past year

37:32.500 --> 37:33.500
of running the game.

37:33.500 --> 37:38.420
Sj100Matt says, if you, Niantic, didn't expect this outcome, then you didn't learn from the

37:38.420 --> 37:41.420
disaster when the game first came out.

37:41.420 --> 37:45.180
Let's see, JD wonders, who would Niantic even sell to?

37:45.180 --> 37:49.980
Like I mean, I don't think Google would take them back, Sj100Matt proposes Amazon.

37:49.980 --> 37:56.820
Come on, Noel Gus says, Niantic is that X that you can't quit, but should.

37:56.820 --> 38:00.140
That's kind of how I feel about Ingress once in a while, it's like, I really need to break

38:00.140 --> 38:01.140
up with you.

38:01.140 --> 38:02.140
I did play a little bit of Ingress.

38:02.140 --> 38:05.420
Yeah, it's like, once in a while, the sex is kind of good, you know?

38:05.420 --> 38:07.940
Well, it was just like, okay, here's why I played Ingress.

38:07.940 --> 38:10.740
Blowing up a portal feels real good once in a while.

38:10.740 --> 38:14.540
Here's why I played Ingress this weekend, because I was playing Pokemon Go and I caught

38:14.540 --> 38:18.300
all the Pokemon in the area that I was sitting in and nothing was spawning.

38:18.300 --> 38:19.900
I was like, okay, fuck this shit.

38:19.900 --> 38:20.900
Went to Ingress.

38:20.900 --> 38:22.380
Oh, hey, there's an unclaimed portal.

38:22.380 --> 38:23.380
Captured it.

38:23.380 --> 38:24.380
Hacked it.

38:24.380 --> 38:28.420
Shut it off.

38:28.420 --> 38:32.820
Stoppy in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says about Charles's clip, this is like listening

38:32.820 --> 38:34.100
to a police confession.

38:34.100 --> 38:35.100
Maybe he was wearing a wire.

38:35.100 --> 38:38.340
It was, it was a little bit like that, but as we know, Charles live streaming may have

38:38.340 --> 38:40.100
brought down the entire event.

38:40.100 --> 38:41.500
We heard that.

38:41.500 --> 38:47.340
Let's see, act deft in chat says, I won't ever go back to Ingress, Sj100Matt says, I

38:47.340 --> 38:52.020
would buy it if they came out and said people were spoofing location or DDoSing to mess

38:52.020 --> 38:53.020
up the event.

38:53.020 --> 38:55.940
I mean, that's a gimme excuse, but the game was working everywhere else.

38:55.940 --> 39:00.540
And again, I want to point out, it's not all necessary, necessarily bad news.

39:00.540 --> 39:05.420
And that's why I'm not willing to say, because that would be a game's adoration.

39:05.420 --> 39:09.880
That would be a Forbes headline to say this game is shit, write it off as the shit it

39:09.880 --> 39:15.180
is and stop playing that shit because Pokemon Go isn't shit.

39:15.180 --> 39:22.180
It's just some of the tech behind it and some of the support the game is getting is shit.

39:22.180 --> 39:23.180
I don't know about that.

39:23.180 --> 39:25.980
There's still no game to it yet, other than collecting Pokemon.

39:25.980 --> 39:31.260
I think the gym, I think the gym thing really, really revitalized, it gave the game a kick

39:31.260 --> 39:37.820
in the ass that it needed, but there's still no scoring, no game, no like, you know, teams.

39:37.820 --> 39:39.380
It doesn't fucking matter.

39:39.380 --> 39:44.820
I still think for the folks that are collecting, there's a lot there to do and the team bonuses.

39:44.820 --> 39:47.960
Trust me, you need those extra balls when you're catching those legendaries.

39:47.960 --> 39:50.580
So you know, there's, is it perfect?

39:50.580 --> 39:51.580
No.

39:51.580 --> 39:55.060
Any mobile game that wants to stay relevant should continue to invent itself every few

39:55.060 --> 39:56.060
months.

39:56.060 --> 39:58.100
But anyway, I know this topic's gone on a long time.

39:58.100 --> 40:02.020
Again, I really want to thank Charles for leaving us that message and being kind of

40:02.020 --> 40:05.800
a guest correspondent tonight on the show and I want to encourage anybody who does love

40:05.800 --> 40:11.260
Pokemon Go like I still do, but even you still get frustrated with people that you love once

40:11.260 --> 40:15.880
in a while, check out Pokemon Go podcast because there's a lot of great discussion there and

40:15.880 --> 40:20.780
I'm sure he'll tell us much more that we didn't get here on the show tonight.

40:20.780 --> 40:25.560
But yeah, I mean, it's going to be an interesting next couple weeks to see what the fallout

40:25.560 --> 40:26.800
truly is from this.

40:26.800 --> 40:30.480
And if Niantic really does try to do this again in 2018, you know, John Hanke teased

40:30.480 --> 40:35.120
on stage a Pokemon Go 2018 and this was before the refund chat.

40:35.120 --> 40:38.160
So we'll see, we'll see.

40:38.160 --> 40:39.160
All right.

40:39.160 --> 40:40.600
Anyhow, let's move on.

40:40.600 --> 40:43.640
We got to get to some more stories because there's a lot of gaming stories that happened

40:43.640 --> 40:48.260
this week, but of course, uh, it would not be a show unless we talked about our own gaming

40:48.260 --> 40:50.640
weeks and the types of video games that you've been playing this week.

40:50.640 --> 40:52.320
So Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

40:52.320 --> 40:58.300
Uh, I finally beat the main story of Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2, um, while streaming with

40:58.300 --> 41:00.720
all of three people watching at 3 AM.

41:00.720 --> 41:02.800
Um, it was fun.

41:02.800 --> 41:03.800
It's cute.

41:03.800 --> 41:10.000
I will go back and replay all the scenarios, um, in order for anyone who wants to see them.

41:10.000 --> 41:14.800
Um, that's kind of it other than the cell phone games.

41:14.800 --> 41:18.960
Uh, and so you are streaming again, so if people aren't following you on Twitch, they

41:18.960 --> 41:19.960
can follow you at...

41:19.960 --> 41:25.080
Basically stream me when I'm bored, but it's DarkSakura underscore O-L-R.

41:25.080 --> 41:26.080
Okay, awesome.

41:26.080 --> 41:30.300
Um, and you are hosted, I double checked the VoG network, uh, or the VoG network on Twitch

41:30.300 --> 41:31.300
hosts you automatically.

41:31.300 --> 41:35.920
So, all right, I'll set up all the hosting stuff, but like I spent like an hour or so

41:35.920 --> 41:38.680
putting together my offline banner and whatnot, which is...

41:38.680 --> 41:39.680
It's important.

41:39.680 --> 41:45.960
It's a combination of the style for the Danganronpa things and then my Dragon Ball character.

41:45.960 --> 41:48.720
Are you going to continue to Dragon Ball or is there other games you're looking at doing?

41:48.720 --> 41:49.960
Are you going to do Dream Daddy?

41:49.960 --> 41:51.760
Because that's the one everybody's doing right now.

41:51.760 --> 41:56.960
I haven't bought Dream Daddy yet, so I'm not going to play that one since everyone else

41:56.960 --> 41:57.960
is.

41:57.960 --> 41:58.960
Yeah.

41:58.960 --> 42:04.860
But I'm probably going to do, um, uh, Danganronpa, Ultra Despair Girls, and, uh, How to Fool

42:04.860 --> 42:07.200
Boyfriend and Holiday Star down the line.

42:07.200 --> 42:08.200
Nice.

42:08.200 --> 42:13.160
Um, I don't know, I'll find something else kind of weird and interesting to stream.

42:13.160 --> 42:14.160
All right.

42:14.160 --> 42:15.920
Loki, how was your gaming week?

42:15.920 --> 42:17.360
I didn't really play anything, honestly.

42:17.360 --> 42:22.800
I played very little of, um, the Office Space Clicker game.

42:22.800 --> 42:24.400
I'm kind of getting bored of it.

42:24.400 --> 42:31.240
Um, and then Pokémon GO, I really, I haven't really played that much this week, maybe once

42:31.240 --> 42:36.720
or twice at the most, and Ingress, like I said, I touched it for like maybe two minutes

42:36.720 --> 42:38.160
and that was it.

42:38.160 --> 42:44.480
I meant to play Superhot VR, because I have that now, but, um, I just hadn't gotten around

42:44.480 --> 42:45.880
to setting it up.

42:45.880 --> 42:50.640
I still want to get one of those Oculus Rift, but $400 is a lot of money right now.

42:50.640 --> 42:51.640
Yeah, it is.

42:51.640 --> 42:56.680
I still want it, but yeah, it's hard to like, if I'd known that like a couple months ago,

42:56.680 --> 43:00.800
I could have budgeted better, but yeah, it's not working out right now.

43:00.800 --> 43:01.800
All right.

43:01.800 --> 43:02.800
Uh, my gaming week.

43:02.800 --> 43:05.880
Obviously, I played a lot of Pokémon GO, as I've talked about earlier.

43:05.880 --> 43:10.560
Continuing to play the Final Fantasy XII HD remaster, um, I've now passed the point

43:10.560 --> 43:14.040
in this one than I did when I originally played the game on PlayStation 2, so that's really

43:14.040 --> 43:15.040
cool.

43:15.040 --> 43:18.320
Um, so I've been playing more of that and I love the remaster.

43:18.320 --> 43:23.080
Unfortunately, I keep getting distracted by groups for Final Fantasy XIV, because I'm

43:23.080 --> 43:24.320
still trying to run my characters in that.

43:24.320 --> 43:25.320
I got it.

43:25.320 --> 43:29.320
This is a story that we didn't, I don't think it was in our show role, but I saw this somewhere

43:29.320 --> 43:30.360
because they were complaining about it.

43:30.360 --> 43:31.360
I haven't read on it.

43:31.360 --> 43:32.360
Okay.

43:32.360 --> 43:33.360
Oh, is it?

43:33.360 --> 43:34.360
I'm sorry.

43:34.360 --> 43:35.360
It was in other territories is what it was.

43:35.840 --> 43:41.120
They had raised the cost, the monthly fee for other territories outside of the US to

43:41.120 --> 43:42.760
get in line.

43:42.760 --> 43:47.240
So like in other areas, like it was equivalent of like $45 a month.

43:47.240 --> 43:48.240
Wow.

43:48.240 --> 43:49.240
Yeah.

43:49.240 --> 43:50.240
It's ridiculous.

43:50.240 --> 43:51.240
That's weird.

43:51.240 --> 43:52.240
For Final Fantasy XIV?

43:52.240 --> 43:53.240
Well, yeah.

43:53.240 --> 43:56.520
It's for like other territories that don't like, economically, they're not up to our

43:56.520 --> 43:57.520
level.

43:57.520 --> 43:58.520
Okay.

43:58.520 --> 44:00.120
So like that was like, you know, quite a bit of money.

44:00.120 --> 44:01.120
Interesting.

44:01.120 --> 44:03.800
But I'd like to know what is World of Warcraft costs in those countries?

44:04.240 --> 44:05.240
Is that a competitive price?

44:05.240 --> 44:06.240
I don't know.

44:06.240 --> 44:07.240
Yeah.

44:07.240 --> 44:08.240
Who knows?

44:08.240 --> 44:09.240
Interesting.

44:09.240 --> 44:13.160
Well, anyway, here, the game's still running great and I'm having a good time.

44:13.160 --> 44:16.080
They did a little patch this week.

44:16.080 --> 44:19.240
They put out the raids not that long ago and now you can get the more advanced tomes.

44:19.240 --> 44:20.240
There's more stuff to explore.

44:20.240 --> 44:21.240
So I've been doing that.

44:21.240 --> 44:25.060
I think I did a live stream earlier this week of Final Fantasy XIV.

44:25.060 --> 44:28.440
And then this weekend I've been playing a bit of Splatoon 2 just came out.

44:28.440 --> 44:32.160
So I did pick up Splatoon 2 on the Switch and I've been playing that.

44:32.160 --> 44:38.120
And I'm, you know, it is, there are a lot of similarities to Splatoon 1, obviously.

44:38.120 --> 44:42.740
The multiplayer feels very, very similar, but Splatoon 1's multiplayer wasn't exactly

44:42.740 --> 44:45.300
broken in the formula of how the game works.

44:45.300 --> 44:46.600
So they didn't change a lot.

44:46.600 --> 44:47.960
So I think that's good.

44:47.960 --> 44:53.880
I do love it on the Switch because of the fact that you can do the portable as well.

44:53.880 --> 44:57.520
So I can kind of play it while I'm in bed and do the multiplayer, you know, stuff that

44:57.520 --> 44:58.520
way.

44:58.520 --> 45:03.720
Or, you know, I can play it on the TV and I can use, you know, the dog ear controller

45:03.720 --> 45:04.720
if I want.

45:04.720 --> 45:09.280
I've been trying to force myself to learn motion controls, but one thing I'm finding

45:09.280 --> 45:14.120
is that I just can't do it if I'm playing a paint roller, which I tend to do in multiplayer

45:14.120 --> 45:15.120
mode.

45:15.120 --> 45:17.920
Like I just don't see how motion control benefits the paint roller thing.

45:17.920 --> 45:21.480
Somebody was trying to tell me, oh, well for the splashing and that it was like, I can't

45:21.480 --> 45:22.480
do it.

45:22.480 --> 45:23.920
It just, it throws me off so much.

45:23.920 --> 45:28.760
And I was enjoying, like, there's like a gun that kind of like, it fires a lot of paint

45:28.760 --> 45:29.880
in a straight line.

45:29.880 --> 45:32.320
It's supposed to be like a sniper rifle basically.

45:32.320 --> 45:35.480
So I was, I was really enjoying like how that weapon was functioning.

45:35.480 --> 45:37.220
So I was like trying to play with it.

45:37.220 --> 45:42.820
And I did find that using motion controls for that is a little more like mouse.

45:42.820 --> 45:47.800
It feels, you know, it feels a lot better than say like the, even, you know, the Wii

45:47.800 --> 45:51.160
U or the Wii or whatever, because obviously motion controls have progressed a lot now

45:51.160 --> 45:52.560
that we're here on the Switch.

45:52.560 --> 45:58.400
So the motion controls, like they feel nice, but yet my scores in those matches were atrocious.

45:58.400 --> 46:02.560
So I must not know what the fuck I'm doing with the sniper rifle, but like, I'm trying

46:02.560 --> 46:06.320
to learn the motion control, but when I play single, single player mode, I'm kind of like

46:06.320 --> 46:10.520
forcing myself to use motion control and I'm, I'm, I'm doing okay.

46:10.520 --> 46:14.040
So you know, it has a lot of the same stuff from Splatoon 1, but it's just different now

46:14.040 --> 46:16.180
because they have a new single player mode.

46:16.180 --> 46:19.640
There is a co-op mode, but admittedly I've done nothing other than the tutorial.

46:19.640 --> 46:21.400
So I don't have a lot to say about that yet.

46:21.440 --> 46:24.760
I've just been trying to focus on the multiplayer when I have been playing it.

46:24.760 --> 46:27.800
I've been losing a lot of matches, but I've been winning a few.

46:27.800 --> 46:32.520
So I do feel like the game might be waiting because I noticed there's this little icon

46:32.520 --> 46:36.920
where this number changes and I'm like, is that like my streak balance or something where

46:36.920 --> 46:39.600
like if I'm winning a lot of matches, it's going to give me harder opponents.

46:39.600 --> 46:41.720
If I'm losing a lot, it's going to give me easier ones.

46:41.720 --> 46:45.960
I think that might be what it's doing because it does feel like I don't lose a lot in a

46:45.960 --> 46:47.720
row until I finally win one.

46:47.720 --> 46:51.360
So, you know, props to the matchmaking in that regard.

46:51.360 --> 46:55.320
I know it's coming up later in the show about Nintendo's whole app and all that stuff.

46:55.320 --> 47:00.520
Admittedly, I haven't even tried the online, like trying to find to play with a friend

47:00.520 --> 47:03.920
or I haven't even done, I haven't touched it because everybody and everything on the

47:03.920 --> 47:05.360
internet is just, it's garbage.

47:05.360 --> 47:08.960
So I'm like, I'm not going to touch it yet.

47:08.960 --> 47:14.200
Anyway, is there other ways to like, you know, set up games without the app?

47:14.200 --> 47:15.040
Yeah, oh yeah.

47:15.040 --> 47:17.320
You could just go into join a friend in progress.

47:17.320 --> 47:20.920
And I think some people did that for me because I saw a Twitter handle that follows me on

47:20.960 --> 47:24.880
Twitter and I was like, I think that person's a Twitter, but I don't know because the game

47:24.880 --> 47:28.720
doesn't tell you, oh, this is your friend or you know, whatever.

47:28.720 --> 47:33.800
It doesn't tell you anything about who's joining your match or when or guaranteeing putting

47:33.800 --> 47:35.760
you on the same team or anything like that.

47:35.760 --> 47:39.520
Anyway, I do plan to do Splatoon 2 after the show tonight.

47:39.520 --> 47:44.600
So maybe I'll learn a little bit more about the multiplayer then, but it definitely is

47:44.600 --> 47:47.300
not, it's not Overwatch.

47:47.300 --> 47:48.560
Let's put it that way.

47:48.560 --> 47:53.520
It is not the matchmaking capabilities of a game like Overwatch or Call of Duty or one

47:53.520 --> 47:54.520
of those things.

47:54.520 --> 47:57.960
And I think we all know that based on what we're hearing of the app, which we'll hear

47:57.960 --> 48:00.200
a little more about later on in the show.

48:00.200 --> 48:05.840
But I've just accepted the fact that I'm playing mostly with randoms and it's fine.

48:05.840 --> 48:10.200
But like, you know, if somebody joins my game and it says, let's say, cause the name that

48:10.200 --> 48:12.760
shows up is just the name you play with on the Wii.

48:12.760 --> 48:15.840
So let's say somebody joins my game and it's Shane.

48:15.880 --> 48:19.640
Is it the Shane I know from Ranger Pride that comes on this show occasionally?

48:19.640 --> 48:23.200
Or is it just some other guy that happens to be named Shane?

48:23.200 --> 48:24.200
I don't know.

48:24.200 --> 48:25.720
Cause the game doesn't tell me.

48:25.720 --> 48:30.240
So there's just, there's a lot of weird shit when it comes to the online support that I

48:30.240 --> 48:32.200
feel like they still have to figure out.

48:32.200 --> 48:35.720
And I feel like maybe the team has one vision, but then it's like Nintendo's infrastructure

48:35.720 --> 48:37.320
might limit them on some things.

48:37.320 --> 48:42.720
So I'm hoping through patches, they're able to make some more of this make sense.

48:43.360 --> 48:47.200
As far as the game itself, I'm fine.

48:47.200 --> 48:51.640
Like, you know, I feel like I might even be having a little more fun with it this time

48:51.640 --> 48:54.760
than I was when I first played it on Wii U, just because I feel like I understand the

48:54.760 --> 48:58.480
game a little better just from watching other people play it and live streams and stuff.

48:58.480 --> 49:00.760
So I mean, you know, that part's cool.

49:00.760 --> 49:05.000
I do feel like when I do the paint roller, I am learning how to do things like how to

49:05.000 --> 49:06.680
sneak up on people.

49:06.680 --> 49:11.120
Like you know, I got an ability that makes, when I swim, I'm more like a Ninja.

49:11.120 --> 49:12.640
I'm a lot harder to spot.

49:12.640 --> 49:16.480
So I'm getting really good at swimming up behind people and splat them with the roller.

49:16.480 --> 49:17.800
So like, I'm learning little tricks like that.

49:17.800 --> 49:20.560
And that does feel really good that like, oh, I'm progressing this time.

49:20.560 --> 49:21.640
That's nice.

49:21.640 --> 49:23.600
So there you go.

49:23.600 --> 49:29.040
Anyway, let's see, I'm trying to look in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

49:29.040 --> 49:31.960
It sounds like ActDeft had some real issues getting the game.

49:31.960 --> 49:34.320
I guess Amazon strikes again.

49:34.320 --> 49:37.120
ActDeft says I'll have to wait until Tuesday.

49:37.120 --> 49:41.640
And that's because, oh, it's UPS or USPS's fault, which I think are the vendors that

49:41.640 --> 49:45.880
Amazon uses, question mark, anyway.

49:45.880 --> 49:51.400
Let's see, other comments in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

49:51.400 --> 49:58.320
Let's see, yeah, oh no, ActDeft is definitely blaming Amazon as I scroll up there.

49:58.320 --> 49:59.320
What's happening there?

49:59.320 --> 50:02.800
I don't see a lot of other people that have been playing Splatoon commenting on that.

50:02.800 --> 50:04.280
But maybe we'll get some more there.

50:04.280 --> 50:08.520
So yeah, again, I've been enjoying the game.

50:08.520 --> 50:13.920
I will probably enjoy it more when they can make the friends and joining people seamless.

50:13.920 --> 50:18.040
And this whole fact that co-op mode is only available some of the time, which is so fucking

50:18.040 --> 50:19.040
weird to me.

50:19.040 --> 50:23.400
Yeah, I saw your post and I was like, so it's like up for 24 hours and then down for 24

50:23.400 --> 50:24.400
hours?

50:24.400 --> 50:25.760
Well, that's what I heard it was supposed to be.

50:25.760 --> 50:29.960
But then this weekend, it's been mostly up, except it will be down for random ass two

50:29.960 --> 50:30.960
hour periods.

50:30.960 --> 50:35.320
Like it does, it just, it doesn't make sense.

50:35.320 --> 50:38.880
Like a lot of Nintendo online things, it doesn't make sense.

50:38.880 --> 50:44.160
And this continues the trend, which is unfortunate because the game is a lot of fun when you

50:44.160 --> 50:45.480
know you can play it.

50:45.480 --> 50:49.560
So anyway, all right, let's move on.

50:49.560 --> 50:52.800
I want to get into some gaming news because I know we're going to talk about this Nintendo

50:52.800 --> 50:54.840
online thing in a little bit.

50:54.840 --> 50:56.360
Just some quick announcements.

50:56.360 --> 50:59.120
First off, we will not be here over Labor Day weekend.

50:59.120 --> 51:01.280
I will be in Atlanta at Dragon Con.

51:01.280 --> 51:06.560
So if you are in the Southeast area, anywhere near Atlanta, you should come to Dragon Con

51:06.560 --> 51:07.840
and have fun.

51:07.840 --> 51:08.840
Party with us.

51:08.840 --> 51:11.840
I should know a little more about panels, appearances, things like that a little closer

51:11.840 --> 51:13.040
to the show.

51:13.040 --> 51:15.760
So I'll be plugging those again.

51:15.760 --> 51:17.280
You can find me at Dragon Con.

51:17.280 --> 51:18.280
I'll be there.

51:18.280 --> 51:19.280
Bobby Blackolf would be there.

51:19.280 --> 51:20.840
I think John from Critical Myth is there.

51:20.840 --> 51:22.520
I know some other folks from VOG Network.

51:22.520 --> 51:24.920
I don't know the full roll call, but I know some other folks will be there too.

51:24.920 --> 51:25.920
So it'll be a lot of fun.

51:25.920 --> 51:31.320
All right, let's get into some gaming news for tonight's Loki starting us off.

51:31.320 --> 51:35.400
So in like, I will never ask for this news.

51:35.400 --> 51:39.160
Atari has announced that they're releasing a new console.

51:39.160 --> 51:41.440
The Atari box.

51:41.440 --> 51:45.160
It's a PC based system that's going to play old and current games.

51:45.160 --> 51:46.760
They haven't announced the price point.

51:46.760 --> 51:50.240
They've released a picture though that looks kind of neat, like the faux wood green on

51:50.240 --> 51:53.240
the front there and the glowing Atari logo.

51:53.240 --> 51:57.360
And then they also have one I think that resembles the 7800 maybe?

51:57.360 --> 52:01.600
With the red logo in all black.

52:01.600 --> 52:06.120
So that's literally all we know about it right now, other than I guess they said they're

52:06.120 --> 52:11.600
going to be funding the console via crowdfunding, hooray!

52:11.600 --> 52:14.360
And we'll be listening closely to community feedback.

52:14.360 --> 52:24.520
Although it reminds me so much of like the Coleco chameleon, you know?

52:24.520 --> 52:25.520
Yeah.

52:25.520 --> 52:30.600
I don't think you're supposed to put water in that.

52:30.600 --> 52:38.080
I think that the crowdsourcing on there is probably more of a desperate attempt for them

52:38.080 --> 52:42.160
to try to make sure they can get the money on it.

52:42.160 --> 52:47.040
But I don't get why.

52:47.040 --> 52:49.960
I looked at it and I just was like, why?

52:49.960 --> 52:52.800
Well, I mean it depends.

52:52.800 --> 52:55.240
Some of Atari's games are interesting.

52:55.240 --> 52:56.840
I don't know.

52:56.840 --> 53:01.920
They've had so many Atari consoles come out, like the whole flashback consoles.

53:01.920 --> 53:07.120
I don't know if I'd really want to play more like 2600 games or anything like that.

53:07.120 --> 53:13.600
But I'd be interested to see like, you know, other Atari games that like maybe Hellesu

53:13.600 --> 53:14.600
Arcade.

53:14.600 --> 53:19.880
Imagine like arcade titles, like if they had like good emulation of arcade titles like

53:19.880 --> 53:22.360
San Francisco Rush.

53:22.360 --> 53:26.280
But I think that their whole thing that they're going for is the classic Atari.

53:26.280 --> 53:28.680
Well everything's classic now for Atari.

53:28.680 --> 53:35.280
I mean the real classic Atari, the 2600, the 5200, and the 7800.

53:35.280 --> 53:36.280
I don't know.

53:36.280 --> 53:39.680
I hope that there's more to it than just that because I don't see why I would need to get

53:39.680 --> 53:41.640
a console for that.

53:41.640 --> 53:42.640
Okay, sorry guys.

53:42.640 --> 53:46.000
Loki made the offhanded comment about the water because I just spilled water all over

53:46.000 --> 53:47.000
the keyboard.

53:47.000 --> 53:50.160
So I'm going to pray that I still have a working keyboard or trying to finish tonight's show.

53:50.160 --> 53:52.040
It's going to be interesting.

53:52.040 --> 53:55.160
But in the meantime, that's why I got real quiet there for a minute.

53:55.160 --> 54:00.000
It might understand that this thing is like if the Ouya and an Atari flashback console

54:00.000 --> 54:01.000
had a baby.

54:01.000 --> 54:02.000
Is that basically what this is?

54:02.000 --> 54:05.800
Well, as far as we know right now, because all we know is that it's a box and that it's

54:05.800 --> 54:07.920
going to have some sort of components inside of it.

54:07.920 --> 54:11.560
As far as what it's going to do and how powerful it is and how much it costs and how they're

54:11.560 --> 54:14.480
going to fund it and how can I buy one.

54:14.480 --> 54:15.920
We don't know any of that.

54:15.920 --> 54:23.080
But now am I wrong in thinking they just announced the Atari flashback eight, seven or eight

54:23.080 --> 54:24.080
if I'm not...

54:24.080 --> 54:25.080
Eight.

54:25.080 --> 54:26.080
Yeah.

54:26.080 --> 54:27.080
They just announced that either this week.

54:27.080 --> 54:30.200
I don't know if somebody else holds the license for that or what have you, but I know they're

54:30.200 --> 54:31.920
getting Activision games this time.

54:31.920 --> 54:34.360
Yeah, Activision games and HDMI out.

54:34.360 --> 54:35.680
It's going to do 720p.

54:35.680 --> 54:40.640
So honestly, right now I'm more jazzed about that flashback console because it's going

54:40.640 --> 54:44.760
to have kaboom capers and pitfall and some of the Activision classics.

54:44.760 --> 54:47.440
I don't know that I would want to play them in 1080p.

54:47.440 --> 54:50.760
So when I say kaboom, I ran two games together.

54:50.760 --> 54:53.280
Kaboom and Keystone capers are going to be in there anyway.

54:53.280 --> 54:56.680
I don't know that I would want to play them in 1080p because I'll be honest when we do

54:56.680 --> 55:02.240
Atari party, we have ours hooked up to some pretty nice high res monitors and it just

55:02.240 --> 55:03.240
doesn't look the same.

55:03.240 --> 55:04.360
I like my flicker.

55:04.360 --> 55:05.360
It's all good.

55:06.040 --> 55:12.000
It'll just be one like fuzzy mess, but that's what, I mean, to be fair, I mean, most people

55:12.000 --> 55:16.120
that buy these flashback consoles, aren't, uh, I don't know what the word would be classic

55:16.120 --> 55:22.920
gaming purists, I guess for lack of a better term, um, that, well, the reality is most

55:22.920 --> 55:26.080
people don't have those TVs anymore.

55:26.080 --> 55:29.400
So if they're going to buy a console like this, they have to have HDMI, right?

55:29.400 --> 55:31.740
Even though it might not look quite right.

55:31.740 --> 55:36.440
But anyway, my point is as, as cool as these Atari flashback console sound, it sounds like

55:36.440 --> 55:42.380
this thing that's coming out is just one of those mashed with some type of open-ended

55:42.380 --> 55:43.380
question mark.

55:43.380 --> 55:48.060
I mean, I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt until if it's crowdfunded, if

55:48.060 --> 55:50.700
it's crowdfunded, I'm not, well, right.

55:50.700 --> 55:52.300
I who said I'm going to back it.

55:52.300 --> 55:54.300
I'm not backing that shit.

55:54.300 --> 55:56.820
I mean, I'm just curious to see what it is.

55:56.820 --> 55:57.940
Like I'm not pulling it.

55:57.940 --> 56:00.060
I learned my lesson with OUYA.

56:00.060 --> 56:01.540
That's enough.

56:01.540 --> 56:02.540
Don't get me wrong.

56:02.540 --> 56:03.540
That shell looks awesome.

56:03.540 --> 56:08.220
Like if anything, the very least, I'd love one of those, you know, Atari, the Atari box

56:08.220 --> 56:12.420
with the wood grain on the front as a shell for like a raspberry pie or something like

56:12.420 --> 56:13.420
that.

56:13.420 --> 56:14.460
Cause that shit looks nice.

56:14.460 --> 56:17.220
But I mean, other than that, yeah, who knows?

56:17.220 --> 56:18.220
I don't know.

56:18.220 --> 56:22.060
It'd be interesting to see, and it's kind of just out of nowhere.

56:22.060 --> 56:23.060
It's like, okay.

56:23.060 --> 56:24.060
It was very random.

56:24.060 --> 56:25.060
Right.

56:25.060 --> 56:27.060
Um, you know, it's got SD card support as well.

56:27.060 --> 56:29.820
I don't know.

56:29.820 --> 56:33.940
Going to live.vognetwork.com, Hitstun says, wait, we know what's, we know what's in the

56:33.940 --> 56:34.940
Atari box.

56:34.940 --> 56:36.460
I was hoping for Jaguar games.

56:36.460 --> 56:39.140
Uh, well they haven't ruled it out.

56:39.140 --> 56:44.020
So tempest 2000 could still be a reality, but don't count on it.

56:44.020 --> 56:46.300
I just hope it's not their new new Atari games.

56:46.300 --> 56:48.620
Cause apparently their new new Atari games are really shit.

56:48.620 --> 56:54.180
Like there was a roller coaster tycoon world apparently not so good.

56:54.180 --> 56:58.900
And the last alone, the dark game that they put out was shit.

56:58.900 --> 57:02.260
Doomplague in chat says we're talking about a company that filed bankruptcy and sold all

57:02.260 --> 57:06.500
of its modern franchises, then said they would focus on casino games.

57:06.500 --> 57:11.380
Uh, dungeon buster says, I'm curious to see what it is, but my expectations are set way

57:11.380 --> 57:12.860
low for this thing.

57:12.860 --> 57:16.620
Uh, and that's probably the boat I'm in is I'm like, Ooh, I kind of want to get where

57:16.620 --> 57:21.420
those Atari flashback consoles, Atari box crowdfunding.

57:21.420 --> 57:22.860
Good luck guys.

57:22.860 --> 57:26.060
We'll see when you get all the details at the very least, you know, one of those is

57:26.060 --> 57:27.060
going to come out.

57:27.060 --> 57:28.660
The other one on the other hand, you have no idea.

57:29.420 --> 57:32.820
Cause they could, they say, Oh yeah, we're going to release this, it's grand crowdfunded

57:32.820 --> 57:35.420
and no one gives a shit and then it doesn't get crowdfunded.

57:35.420 --> 57:36.420
All right.

57:36.420 --> 57:39.780
Well, another thing that's been going on this weekend is San Diego comic con.

57:39.780 --> 57:42.900
And I know a lot of you guys been watching for what's been coming out of that because

57:42.900 --> 57:47.340
there's, you know, there's always some announcements and things that can directly affect video

57:47.340 --> 57:48.340
games.

57:48.340 --> 57:52.060
For example, more characters being announced for Marvel versus Capcom infinite.

57:52.060 --> 57:58.420
Uh, some of the confirmations we got at, uh, uh, San Diego comic con include, uh, Frank

57:58.420 --> 58:02.300
West, Mike Hagar and nemesis.

58:02.300 --> 58:05.700
So we got to see some of those, uh, uh, in the game.

58:05.700 --> 58:06.700
And that's pretty cool.

58:06.700 --> 58:10.740
Cause obviously Frank West from dead rising, very popular character, Mike Hagar final fight.

58:10.740 --> 58:14.220
So, you know, uh, some good Capcom stars to be in that game.

58:14.220 --> 58:19.100
Uh, which I think even though a lot of people are kind of like, I don't know, they're all

58:19.100 --> 58:21.420
in the roster that leaked out a while ago.

58:21.420 --> 58:25.820
So, uh, but dark soccer, you, you still want to give this game a chance, right?

58:25.820 --> 58:26.820
Yeah.

58:26.820 --> 58:27.820
We'll see.

58:27.820 --> 58:28.820
I do.

58:28.820 --> 58:33.460
Do you look, will you be playing as Frank West or Mike Hagar nemesis?

58:33.460 --> 58:34.460
We'll see.

58:34.460 --> 58:35.460
We'll see.

58:35.460 --> 58:37.800
Uh, Oh, here's a, okay.

58:37.800 --> 58:41.580
So they released this on, uh, mobile phones this week.

58:41.580 --> 58:45.000
It is a crossover between hello kitty and Pac-Man.

58:45.000 --> 58:46.000
That's right.

58:46.000 --> 58:47.000
It's hello kitty and Pac-Man.

58:47.000 --> 58:51.440
Uh, and uh, it's in the regular Pac-Man mobile game, which is available on the Google play

58:51.440 --> 58:53.280
store in the Apple app store.

58:53.280 --> 58:57.280
And uh, what they did at comic con though is that there's actually crossover themed

58:57.280 --> 58:58.680
merchandise.

58:58.680 --> 59:04.040
And that part might be really cool, but let me tell you this, uh, Alan saw the thing about

59:04.040 --> 59:06.560
hello kitty and Pac-Man and said, Oh Rob, you got to download the game.

59:06.560 --> 59:12.000
So I did fucking garbage.

59:12.000 --> 59:15.600
And I like a lot of retro stuff and I like Pac-Man.

59:15.600 --> 59:18.000
I fucking have streamed championship edition two.

59:18.000 --> 59:24.240
I think championship edition DX is great mobile phone game ass.

59:24.240 --> 59:25.960
Like it's just, it's not good guys.

59:25.960 --> 59:26.960
It's not good.

59:26.960 --> 59:27.960
I'm sorry.

59:27.960 --> 59:28.960
There's no nice way for me to put it.

59:28.960 --> 59:30.480
It just doesn't translate well to a mobile phone.

59:30.480 --> 59:34.320
Again, the lack of a tactile controller does not do it any favors.

59:34.320 --> 59:39.800
And these whole, like, it's a freemium game where you have to either buy the coins or

59:39.800 --> 59:44.640
earn the coins in these really basic mazes or just, it's just, it's silly.

59:44.680 --> 59:47.360
They just do look kind of cute though.

59:47.360 --> 59:48.360
That's not it.

59:48.360 --> 59:49.360
Hard pass.

59:49.360 --> 59:50.560
All right.

59:50.560 --> 59:54.640
But something that I'm really curious to see if Loki is going to give a hard pass or a,

59:54.640 --> 59:59.200
uh, I'm going out to get in line right now is of course a lot of gamers are taking great

59:59.200 --> 01:00:02.960
interest in the upcoming movie for ready player one.

01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:09.480
And as Loki was hoping, the first teaser was indeed released at San Diego comic con and

01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:12.800
Loki I'm dying to know what you think.

01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:13.880
It was fucking awesome.

01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:14.880
Yeah.

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:18.760
Like it's, it's seriously, I've watched that trailer like 75 times already.

01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:19.760
75 times?

01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:20.760
Yeah.

01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:23.800
It's, it's, it's so like, don't get me wrong.

01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:28.760
Like my wife read the book as well and she said it was just garbage.

01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:35.280
I mean it is a lot of it's just like listing off shit from the eighties.

01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:36.280
That's fine.

01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:40.300
But along with that, if you just ignore the bad writing, because a lot of people ignore

01:00:40.300 --> 01:00:43.480
bad writing and both like the 50 shades of gray fucking twilight.

01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:44.480
Yeah.

01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:45.480
Yeah.

01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:46.480
You know all that shit.

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:47.480
So they ignore the Harry Potter.

01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:48.480
Just kidding.

01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:49.480
Just kidding.

01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:51.200
We're not seeing, this is like fucking literally, this isn't like a literary masterpiece or

01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:52.200
anything like that.

01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:53.480
I'm not going to fucking say that at all.

01:00:53.480 --> 01:01:00.720
It's it's schlock, but it's got some awesome, you know, the story's pretty cool.

01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:04.600
And like the set pieces and like action that are described in there, it's just fucking

01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:05.600
amazing.

01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:09.000
Like you read that and you're like, there's no way they can make this into a movie because

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:12.320
it'd be fucking expensive with all the licensing they would have to do.

01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:16.720
And just looking at the trailer, cause a lot of this stuff in the trailer, like half the

01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:18.660
trailer is not in the book.

01:01:18.660 --> 01:01:20.880
The whole racing thing is not part of the book.

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:21.880
It's new.

01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:27.920
Um, so it's good that they're deviating from that, but it looks so fucking cool.

01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:32.700
I even, I noticed I was just like, it's so goddamn awesome.

01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:34.000
Like a big CG Fest.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:35.000
I don't care.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.960
I'm in, it's, it's in the future.

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:41.340
I guess CG Fest is a lot, but even I noticed, I was like, is that Freddy Krueger?

01:01:41.340 --> 01:01:42.740
Is that the Iron Giant?

01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:44.860
Like what the fuck?

01:01:44.860 --> 01:01:49.700
Fucking Freddy Krueger, the Iron Giant, they had Duke Nukem in there at one point, Deathstroke,

01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:54.740
Harley Quinn, you know, um, I mean there's like tons of references to all sorts of stuff.

01:01:54.740 --> 01:01:57.080
If it's in a Warner Brothers movie, it's probably in here somewhere.

01:01:57.080 --> 01:02:00.700
And even like something that's, you know, maybe not Warner Brothers as well.

01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:03.840
I mean, so it, it looks really awesome.

01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:11.020
So I'm very down to see what this is going to be like and yeah, I'll be there day one.

01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:12.020
Absolutely.

01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:15.580
I mean, it's just, and then also like the, like the musical tones with it.

01:02:15.580 --> 01:02:18.620
I mean, it's just like, so I did enjoy the rush.

01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:19.620
See, I watched the trailer.

01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:21.620
I don't know shit about the book other than Loki's.

01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:22.620
You gotta read the book.

01:02:22.620 --> 01:02:23.620
I have the book.

01:02:23.620 --> 01:02:24.620
You can read the book.

01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:26.980
Uh, Loki's always very excited about it.

01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:29.340
Uh, here's, here's just a plot twist.

01:02:29.340 --> 01:02:33.940
It'll have a lot more chance of actually getting read if I get an audio book just because for

01:02:33.940 --> 01:02:35.140
commutes and things like that.

01:02:35.140 --> 01:02:37.660
Like I just, the audio book is narrated by Wil Wheaton.

01:02:37.660 --> 01:02:38.660
So that's cool.

01:02:38.660 --> 01:02:39.660
All right.

01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:44.420
Uh, even I noticed with the trailer, I was like, all right, this looks like it could

01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:45.700
be, I don't read books.

01:02:45.700 --> 01:02:46.700
Okay.

01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:49.100
I don't like reading books, but this book, I couldn't put it down.

01:02:49.100 --> 01:02:51.540
Um, I noticed rush was in the trailer.

01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:57.740
That's a big part of in, in, in the, the spoiler for the book, I guess in the book, there's

01:02:57.740 --> 01:03:03.700
a guitar hero type thing that he has to do that he has to play Tom Sawyer, I think, or

01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:04.700
I think that's what it was.

01:03:04.700 --> 01:03:07.380
I, yeah, it's been a while since I read the book, but which I think that song was actually

01:03:07.380 --> 01:03:08.380
in guitar heroes.

01:03:08.420 --> 01:03:10.860
I think he has to play that song or something like rock.

01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:13.100
He has to do a guitar hero type thing in there.

01:03:13.100 --> 01:03:19.020
But um, yeah, I mean it, it definitely, it's all the, um, the people that were in the race

01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:23.260
or they call them the Sixers, they're part of this, um, internet company that's evil

01:03:23.260 --> 01:03:24.740
and shit.

01:03:24.740 --> 01:03:28.740
And so of course they're out to find, you know, the hidden Easter egg as well.

01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:32.240
So I mean they, they're using the power of money to be able to do all that.

01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:35.940
But yeah, I mean it's got like, you know, Artemis, one of the characters in the book,

01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:42.380
she's got a, um, a cross between Canada's bike from Akira and I'll Tron light cycle

01:03:42.380 --> 01:03:48.020
and, you know, and of course, um, the main character, Wade, he's got, it's supposed to

01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:53.620
be a cross between the Ecto one, the, uh, back to the future DeLorean and the Knight

01:03:53.620 --> 01:03:56.540
Rider, um, kit car.

01:03:56.540 --> 01:04:00.340
This sounds like internet fanfic gone crazy.

01:04:00.340 --> 01:04:03.420
Come on, Noel, Gus and chat says, Loki's body is ready.

01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:05.140
Oh yeah, I'm, I wasn't ready.

01:04:05.140 --> 01:04:08.780
I've been waiting for this trailer and I, I was like, I was checking the internet and

01:04:08.780 --> 01:04:11.380
checking Twitter and shit like all day long on Saturday.

01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:12.500
I'm like, okay, when's this thing?

01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:13.500
When is it?

01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:14.500
When is it?

01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:15.500
And I saw it.

01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:16.500
I'm like, fuck yes.

01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:17.500
I'm watching that.

01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:18.860
And I was at depth and chat says, can you really tell what the story's about with that

01:04:18.860 --> 01:04:19.860
trailer?

01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:22.820
Well, it, to be fair, it's a teaser, not a trailer, but it's a teaser.

01:04:22.820 --> 01:04:27.460
It's still, I mean, um, no, probably not from that.

01:04:27.460 --> 01:04:30.820
They didn't really explain what it was if it was just a teaser.

01:04:30.820 --> 01:04:34.260
But I mean, being that I've read the book, I know what the story's about.

01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:39.140
Um, did you see now just quickly, some of the other stuff like Dar Sakra, I know, uh,

01:04:39.140 --> 01:04:40.380
aren't you a fan of Ms. Marvel?

01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:42.420
Didn't we get the first look at her today or yesterday?

01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:43.420
I hadn't looked yet.

01:04:43.420 --> 01:04:45.900
Oh, you should look, let me know what you think.

01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:47.540
I'd be curious.

01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:53.660
I watched, um, a few of the other trailers, but I didn't really watch very many.

01:04:53.660 --> 01:04:56.740
I'm kind of waiting for the hype to die down and then I'll make my own decision.

01:04:56.740 --> 01:04:59.520
I just so rarely get out to movies anymore.

01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:00.700
It's just a bummer.

01:05:00.700 --> 01:05:02.900
I need to see more, but I just never do.

01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:03.900
Oh, well.

01:05:03.940 --> 01:05:05.580
I did watch an odd trailer.

01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:06.580
What'd you see?

01:05:06.580 --> 01:05:11.020
For, I don't even know if the movie's already out or not, but it's called Cooties.

01:05:11.020 --> 01:05:14.420
I really liked the trailer for what's the Oprah movie.

01:05:14.420 --> 01:05:15.420
The Oprah-

01:05:15.420 --> 01:05:16.420
Oh, Wrinkle in Time.

01:05:16.420 --> 01:05:17.420
Yes, the Wrinkle in Time.

01:05:17.420 --> 01:05:18.420
The Oprah movie.

01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:19.420
Oprah's in it.

01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:23.780
And it had the Eurythmics cover in the trailer that I actually, I had to go find it on Spotify

01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:24.780
because I was like, all right.

01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:25.780
I couldn't find it.

01:05:25.780 --> 01:05:26.780
I tried.

01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:29.060
It is, it is on the soundtrack to the movie Sucker Punch, believe it or not.

01:05:29.060 --> 01:05:30.060
It's a different one.

01:05:30.060 --> 01:05:32.140
The one that they have in that trailer is not the same.

01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:34.260
Everyone says it is that one, but it's different.

01:05:34.260 --> 01:05:35.260
Oh, I thought it was the-

01:05:35.260 --> 01:05:36.660
No, I've listened to both of them.

01:05:36.660 --> 01:05:37.780
It's a completely different-

01:05:37.780 --> 01:05:40.060
Maybe she remade it again.

01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:41.060
It's different.

01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:42.060
Yeah.

01:05:42.060 --> 01:05:43.060
Interesting.

01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:44.060
But this Cooties movie is weird.

01:05:44.060 --> 01:05:49.500
It has Elijah Wood in it and it's about child zombies that apparently-

01:05:49.500 --> 01:05:51.060
Not another zombie movie.

01:05:51.060 --> 01:05:55.420
They're apparently only susceptible to whatever it is if you haven't gone through puberty.

01:05:55.420 --> 01:05:56.420
Oh, my bad.

01:05:56.420 --> 01:05:57.420
That's right.

01:05:57.420 --> 01:05:58.420
Act F says it was D23.

01:05:58.420 --> 01:05:59.420
Sorry, that was last week's news.

01:05:59.420 --> 01:06:00.420
My bad.

01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:01.420
My bad.

01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:02.420
We'll allow it.

01:06:02.420 --> 01:06:03.420
We'll allow it.

01:06:03.420 --> 01:06:04.420
We'll allow it.

01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:05.420
We'll allow it.

01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:06.420
Blow us together.

01:06:06.420 --> 01:06:07.420
All right.

01:06:07.420 --> 01:06:08.420
I did watch all the Marvel trailers and I watched the DC trailers as well.

01:06:08.420 --> 01:06:09.420
I'm still not hyped about Justice League.

01:06:09.420 --> 01:06:10.420
I'm sorry.

01:06:10.420 --> 01:06:14.740
I'm just, maybe I'm not, well, I am not a DC fan, but like, but you know what, though?

01:06:14.740 --> 01:06:19.180
If they're smart and when Joss Whedon took over, he just made it Wonder Woman too, but

01:06:19.180 --> 01:06:20.180
we'll see.

01:06:20.180 --> 01:06:23.180
No, Wonder Woman had a great part in it and that stuff looked neat.

01:06:23.180 --> 01:06:26.700
It's just, I'm not still just on board with like, it wasn't the same as like the Avengers

01:06:26.700 --> 01:06:27.700
like this.

01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:29.300
I'm just like, I don't fucking care.

01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:30.600
It's kind of what it is.

01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:34.760
But like, holy shit, the Lego movies though, they're fucking knocking that shit out of

01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:38.200
the park because they had a new trailer for the Ninjago movie.

01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:39.200
Fucking hilarious.

01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:43.720
Just the humor that they have in those movies, they're just fantastic.

01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:44.720
So they have that.

01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:48.480
And of course the new Thor Ragnarok trailer looks awesome.

01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:55.220
And then I watched the bootleg of the Avengers infinity war trailer, which looks pretty cool.

01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:56.220
Hope they release that adventure.

01:06:56.220 --> 01:06:57.540
I don't know why they do that.

01:06:57.540 --> 01:06:58.540
Like hold it back.

01:06:58.540 --> 01:07:04.060
They're waiting for Thor Ragnarok to come out or some weird, but, um, yeah, it all looks

01:07:04.060 --> 01:07:05.060
good.

01:07:05.060 --> 01:07:07.580
Um, trying to win else defenders though.

01:07:07.580 --> 01:07:08.580
That's another one too.

01:07:08.580 --> 01:07:12.620
I don't give a shit about like, I didn't, I've never gotten into the Netflix stuff,

01:07:12.620 --> 01:07:15.280
but I'm just like, yeah, I really don't want to see that.

01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:18.780
But stranger things too is, I'm on board for that.

01:07:18.780 --> 01:07:20.260
I was already on board for that.

01:07:20.260 --> 01:07:24.000
So, all right, well we could talk about more movies and TVs, but we need to get back to

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.000
games.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.140
Uh, dark soccer has some shakeup and gaming, right?

01:07:27.140 --> 01:07:28.140
Yep.

01:07:28.740 --> 01:07:33.380
And I'm honestly not terribly surprised by it, but, um, BioWare's, uh, general manager,

01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:38.420
Aaron Flynn, who's been there for 17 years is leaving.

01:07:38.420 --> 01:07:45.840
And to replace him is another former BioWare employee who went off to Microsoft and is

01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:54.000
now coming back, uh, Casey Hudson, which basically it was Hudson's interest in returning that

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.820
led to Flynn making the final decision.

01:07:55.820 --> 01:08:00.840
Of course, that's what it says, but you know, everybody's reading into this.

01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:05.360
Was Mass Effect Andromeda that bad?

01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:07.900
Perhaps that unsupported.

01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:14.120
And if it were me on a project that, you know, that I had hoped would be treated better,

01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:17.660
I'd probably leave too, cause you know, that's just gotta be a blow.

01:08:17.660 --> 01:08:23.920
I mean, this guy was also, uh, if I'm right, like the lead programmer for Dragon Age Origins

01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:24.920
and Mass Effect 2.

01:08:25.020 --> 01:08:27.340
No, he was the director of programming.

01:08:27.340 --> 01:08:34.420
So, you know, two series, you know, and he was also a general manager, of course, while

01:08:34.420 --> 01:08:36.940
Dragon Age Inquisition was going on in Mass Effect 3.

01:08:36.940 --> 01:08:42.440
So I mean, he's had his fingers in the pie for a long time.

01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:46.700
Dungeon Buster in chat says, as one comment I read about on the BioWare news went, someone

01:08:46.700 --> 01:08:48.380
had to fall on their sword.

01:08:48.380 --> 01:08:49.380
Okay.

01:08:49.380 --> 01:08:50.380
But here's my question.

01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:52.660
Who at EA is taking a hit?

01:08:52.660 --> 01:08:57.840
Because I'm sorry, EA needs blame in that what happened with Andromeda needs some big

01:08:57.840 --> 01:09:01.840
time blame, but that's, that's just my thoughts.

01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:02.840
Yeah.

01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:04.640
It is what it is.

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:05.640
All right.

01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:08.880
Well, let's hope the Mass Effect series can maybe recover and maybe with Casey Hudson

01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:12.940
at the helm, maybe he's willing to give this series a shot and maybe we'll really advocate

01:09:12.940 --> 01:09:13.940
for it.

01:09:13.940 --> 01:09:16.040
Cause it is something he was heavily involved in the original trilogy.

01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:17.040
Who knows?

01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:18.040
Who knows?

01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:19.040
We'll see.

01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:20.040
All right.

01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:21.040
Well, moving on.

01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:22.040
Uh, we got some more news.

01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:28.760
So Nintendo released their app, um, just before the launch of Splatoon 2 to basically handle

01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:31.700
their online portion of the Switch.

01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:35.660
So they have the Nintendo Switch online app and you can use it for a bunch of things for

01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:40.300
Splatoon 2, for example, like, uh, matchmaking, uh, game invites.

01:09:40.300 --> 01:09:44.300
They're even having some sort of, uh, voice chat system.

01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:51.460
However, the voice chat, of course, as we've seen the setup before with the headsets that

01:09:51.460 --> 01:09:54.840
were coming out is not necessarily the most elegant solution.

01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:59.640
You have to basically hook your Switch and your phone up to a splitter and hook that

01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:02.680
up to a headset and hope that all works.

01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:08.480
On top of that though, their app has some really funky issues with it.

01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:15.860
So for example, when you're on voice chat, you'll disconnect if, you know, for example,

01:10:15.860 --> 01:10:20.920
another application comes up or it'll restart in the same room.

01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:26.000
If you open, um, I guess it'll restart once you open it up again.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:30.940
But I guess if it's, the app is in the background, it just disconnects unlike a lot of other

01:10:30.940 --> 01:10:31.940
things.

01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:34.220
The other thing too is the app won't work if your phone goes in the power saving sleep

01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:35.220
mode.

01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:39.140
So if your screen is inactive, it will shut off, which is fantastic because then now you

01:10:39.140 --> 01:10:42.180
have to have your phone charging all the time in order for it to work.

01:10:42.180 --> 01:10:46.220
In my opinion, that is the biggest, dumbest oversight in the whole thing is the fact that

01:10:46.220 --> 01:10:48.500
when you go into sleep mode, the thing kicks you off.

01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:54.160
I mean, come on, it's, it's weird.

01:10:54.160 --> 01:11:00.760
I mean, I don't understand why, why they can't just allow it to shut the screen or better

01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:04.720
yet, like if you're in chat mode or something like that, have the screen black out.

01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:08.760
Like Pokemon go does that where like you can leave your phone open, but if you turn your

01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:13.120
phone upside down, it blacks the whole screen and yeah, saves a little power.

01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:15.280
Yeah, it's just, it's stupid.

01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:21.540
Uh, yeah, and I just, again, the app, I tried using the app at least for some of the other

01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:25.220
stuff cause you can go into the splat net or whatever and you can see like, here's my

01:11:25.220 --> 01:11:28.460
last few scores and you can, this is the weird thing.

01:11:28.460 --> 01:11:33.540
You can buy things on the app that are different from the rotations that are in the game live.

01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:36.620
So I guess like a little perk to using the app or something.

01:11:36.620 --> 01:11:37.620
I don't know.

01:11:37.620 --> 01:11:41.060
I shouldn't have to, well, shouldn't have to use the app in the first place.

01:11:41.060 --> 01:11:42.740
It's a little weird, but it's there.

01:11:42.740 --> 01:11:49.520
But I mean, other than that stuff, like what is, what is stopping me from using discord

01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:50.520
or Skype?

01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:51.520
There's really nothing.

01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:52.520
It's actually probably better.

01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:54.020
Oh my God.

01:11:54.020 --> 01:11:55.640
Discord should be having a field day right now.

01:11:55.640 --> 01:12:00.800
That that system is blowing up, which by the way, cheap plug, vog network discord is also

01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:04.360
where actually the next person to join is going to be our 50th member on discord.

01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:05.500
So I'm pretty excited about that.

01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:08.000
So it's over a vog network.com slash discord.

01:12:08.860 --> 01:12:12.820
But anyway, I mean, discord's really blowing up all over the place.

01:12:12.820 --> 01:12:16.980
And now, you know, now it's going to be a possible solution for a lot of people for

01:12:16.980 --> 01:12:22.200
Nintendo's failure to produce a competent app when it comes to voice chatting, which

01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:25.780
I guess, you know, they can always update it and try to make it better, but good Lord.

01:12:25.780 --> 01:12:27.900
Like, okay, I get it.

01:12:27.900 --> 01:12:29.140
Here's my, my problem.

01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:34.300
Like I thought the whole idea of having to have an app for online was stupid, but if

01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:37.860
they can make it work, then cool.

01:12:37.860 --> 01:12:42.240
And it sounds like they're just, it's like, this is like rookie shit that they're fucking

01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:47.400
didn't think, Oh, Hey, maybe we should get it to work when the phone goes to sleep or

01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:48.400
have it run in the background.

01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:49.400
Or I don't know.

01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:52.480
It's like, do they not know how to, do they outsource this shit?

01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:55.000
I mean, do they not know how to fix this?

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.520
I mean, I ding, ding, ding.

01:12:56.520 --> 01:12:59.880
I think we have a winner, but anyway, I would think that they'd be able to patch this in,

01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:03.540
so hopefully they can fix it, but it's just stupid.

01:13:03.540 --> 01:13:09.520
It's not, when people aren't very confident in your ability to handle online and you pull

01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:13.720
this shit, it doesn't help the argument for you.

01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:18.120
Dungeon buster and chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, Nintendo friend code team.

01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:21.160
We made things a little difficult for players to get together.

01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:26.200
Nintendo mobile team, hold our beer.

01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:27.840
And the friend code thing, let's be honest.

01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:29.520
I still don't get that.

01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:36.060
I mean, can we get to the point now where we understand that like, there's, is that

01:13:36.060 --> 01:13:38.540
really preventing anything with friend codes?

01:13:38.540 --> 01:13:43.220
I mean, like I, there's for what it, for what it's worth, which isn't much, but for what

01:13:43.220 --> 01:13:47.260
it's worth, it's not what it used to be in on the Nintendo Wii.

01:13:47.260 --> 01:13:51.020
Like when you find somebody's friend code, you send them a friend request.

01:13:51.020 --> 01:13:53.820
Like it's not one of those, like you both have to add each other or you'll never know

01:13:53.820 --> 01:13:54.820
that.

01:13:54.820 --> 01:14:02.480
It sends a traditional request and you can pull in friends from the Wii U, the 3DS, the

01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:05.000
Miitomo and like other mobile stuff.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:11.360
You can pull in your friends list from those games, but it is weird how the mobile games,

01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:15.560
those mobile games like Miitomo will go to your Twitter and Facebook lists, but your

01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:17.200
Switch will not.

01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:21.240
And I think that just goes to show there's some type of teams not talking to each other

01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:23.200
or outsource stuff going on here.

01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:25.820
Like why is it possible over here, but not possible over here?

01:14:25.820 --> 01:14:29.060
It's weird, but it's not as bad.

01:14:29.060 --> 01:14:33.500
Like, you know, I know Nintendo gets a lot of shit for friend codes as they should, but

01:14:33.500 --> 01:14:35.540
uh, it's not what it was on the Nintendo Wii.

01:14:35.540 --> 01:14:36.540
It's come a long way since then.

01:14:36.540 --> 01:14:40.460
I just think people don't care because like you have, once again, parents let their kids

01:14:40.460 --> 01:14:42.300
play fucking Call of Duty and shit.

01:14:42.300 --> 01:14:45.300
Do you think they really care who their child is online?

01:14:45.300 --> 01:14:46.740
I mean, I don't know.

01:14:46.740 --> 01:14:48.380
Well they, or they should, they should pay attention.

01:14:48.380 --> 01:14:49.380
I don't know.

01:14:49.380 --> 01:14:52.940
Well, anyway, I guess you could always go back to the classic days of the SNES, which

01:14:52.940 --> 01:14:56.480
a lot of people are trying to do because of the Super Nintendo classic.

01:14:56.480 --> 01:15:01.600
And uh, turns out my phone blew up with notifications the other night because Walmart put those

01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:02.600
fuckers up for pre-order.

01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:07.200
Uh, the Super NES classic supposed to be released on September 29th, it's going to cost 80 bucks

01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:11.600
and Walmart put them up for pre-order and of course they're gone.

01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:13.200
But I would, I will give them this credit.

01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:15.000
It took a good 20 minutes or so.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:20.800
Yeah, I had set up notifications for that, but I didn't see my phone in time and my phone

01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:21.800
was charging.

01:15:21.860 --> 01:15:27.140
I was out at dinner and I know shock and awe you guys, sometimes at dinner, I turn my phone

01:15:27.140 --> 01:15:28.620
over and I don't look at it.

01:15:28.620 --> 01:15:29.620
Sometimes.

01:15:29.620 --> 01:15:30.620
Casp.

01:15:30.620 --> 01:15:31.620
I don't know.

01:15:31.620 --> 01:15:34.440
This was one of those times where I was like, you know, if they're going to make it so difficult

01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:37.300
for me to buy one of those systems, I'm just not going to get one.

01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:41.100
And that is exactly, if Nintendo wants me to buy one, I will.

01:15:41.100 --> 01:15:42.820
And I said that a few weeks ago and I'm sticking to it.

01:15:42.820 --> 01:15:48.340
Cause honestly this, this product to me seems like, like the, um, you know, Atari flashbacks

01:15:48.340 --> 01:15:50.040
and new stuff of that sort.

01:15:50.060 --> 01:15:51.900
It's more of like an impulse buy.

01:15:51.900 --> 01:15:55.780
I think, I mean, a lot of people really want it, but I think, you know, if they weren't

01:15:55.780 --> 01:15:59.340
so hard to get, people wouldn't be clamoring as much.

01:15:59.340 --> 01:16:00.340
I don't know.

01:16:00.340 --> 01:16:05.100
Uh, well over at Target, uh, which I didn't really want to buy anything at Walmart anyway.

01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:08.940
So when I hear about their competitor Target, I'm like, okay, well target I can handle.

01:16:08.940 --> 01:16:10.780
Uh, somebody actually tweeted target.

01:16:10.780 --> 01:16:13.260
When can I get a SNES classic?

01:16:13.260 --> 01:16:17.480
Target did reply saying we expect to carry SNES in stores and online, but we don't have

01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:19.300
any info regarding pre-orders.

01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:24.440
So they may or may not be taking pre-orders and I guess this was a follow up to an earlier

01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:28.120
tweet they said, where they said, good news, we'll have this item and it will be available

01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:31.440
for pre-orders, but it sounds like Target and their support team there that's working

01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:33.960
on Twitter and doesn't really have a consistent answer for that.

01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:40.640
And conspiracy theorists myself, um, I would like to say that I noticed that, Hmm, well

01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:45.080
this bad news about your online app sucking, let's let out some of those pre-orders.

01:16:45.080 --> 01:16:48.540
So we get the websites covering that instead.

01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:50.240
And that, Oh, Hey, the SNES classic was out there.

01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:51.560
It's got the positive spin out there.

01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:52.560
Interesting.

01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:56.060
And now no one's talking about the online app sucking.

01:16:56.060 --> 01:17:01.000
I don't think, I think there it's, it's too much of a negative and a positive.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:04.720
You've seen the reviews for that online app in the stores, like on iTunes and on Google

01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:11.400
play, people are, people are not nice, but at the same time, it's not a nice app.

01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:18.320
So I can't, you know, there's appropriate ways to take out your anger, throwing a shoe

01:17:18.340 --> 01:17:21.740
at a stage to some woman who's just contracted to be there.

01:17:21.740 --> 01:17:23.860
That's probably not one of the ways you should do it.

01:17:23.860 --> 01:17:29.300
Um, but I suppose a review on a site like iTunes, um, may be effective.

01:17:29.300 --> 01:17:36.300
You know, Nintendo's got to look at that two star rating and go, Hmm, that doesn't, we

01:17:36.300 --> 01:17:37.900
got two stars.

01:17:37.900 --> 01:17:38.900
Wow.

01:17:38.900 --> 01:17:39.900
All right.

01:17:39.900 --> 01:17:42.940
Anyhow, let's move on dark soccer.

01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:52.580
Well, um, we were at one time World of Warcraft players and have played other, I would say

01:17:52.580 --> 01:17:57.000
Blizzard games, but this one is a little bit surprising.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:02.640
Um, Blizzard actually laid off, uh, Russell Brower, I guess that's how you say his last

01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:03.640
name.

01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:10.640
Um, who was, uh, the senior audio director and composer who's worked on a World of Warcraft,

01:18:10.660 --> 01:18:17.020
Overwatch, Starcraft two, Diablo three, Hearthstone, and all kinds of things he put on his Facebook

01:18:17.020 --> 01:18:26.020
that, um, and would there being some adjustments within the company that his position was made,

01:18:26.020 --> 01:18:34.620
uh, redundant, it, it was eliminated, um, which I suppose is a big shock.

01:18:34.620 --> 01:18:38.380
I mean, for a lot of people, he's had his, you know, his fingers in a lot of Blizzard

01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:46.560
projects and, um, I mean, I would, they might have him freelance, I don't know, but still

01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:49.720
that's just kind of crappy.

01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:50.720
Actually it's a lot crappy.

01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:51.720
Yeah.

01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:54.600
I mean, it's kind of, it's kind of painful to hear that when you think about like what

01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:58.240
great music World of Warcraft had, like I will still always love like the Grizzly Hills,

01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:01.240
like when you go into that zone for the first time, that's an amazing song.

01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:04.160
And, you know, obviously there's a lot of, you know, big, big stuff for World of Warcraft.

01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:08.180
So it's, it's sad to hear about that, but I mean, it kind of sounds like the door is

01:19:08.180 --> 01:19:11.520
open where it's like, well, he's not a full time employee, but he can still, it doesn't

01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:17.640
mean that like, it doesn't sound like it ended ugly, like, um, like the halo, the guy who

01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:21.280
did the halo song for Bungie, it sounds like that didn't end so well.

01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:24.700
But this one sounds a little more like, well, the door's open, so maybe there's freelance

01:19:24.700 --> 01:19:31.560
in the future, but maybe be nice and we'll give you a big parting bonus or it's in like

01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:33.360
some work disclosure.

01:19:33.660 --> 01:19:38.500
Uh, Slykic from Game Buoy is in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com saying, Blizzard

01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:42.900
did a Heroes of the Storm themed employee outing at Medieval Times in Buena Park.

01:19:42.900 --> 01:19:44.620
They put on a special show for them.

01:19:44.620 --> 01:19:45.620
Did you hear that?

01:19:45.620 --> 01:19:47.420
Yeah, I heard, I saw that on Twitter actually.

01:19:47.420 --> 01:19:50.020
So Blizzard does things like that for the employees sometimes.

01:19:50.020 --> 01:19:53.780
They also did, they, one night they did, um, this is a couple of years ago, but I remember

01:19:53.780 --> 01:19:59.100
hearing after BlizzCon, they rented the World of Color thing at Disney California Venture

01:19:59.100 --> 01:20:01.420
and they did like a Blizzard World of Color.

01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:07.200
But it was just like, it wasn't anything, it was like their trailers on the water screen.

01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:09.560
It wasn't like they didn't go out of their way to do a bunch of effects.

01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:12.360
But still, for employees, it's got to be really exciting.

01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:14.400
It is pretty crazy.

01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:15.400
Thank you, RageNator.

01:20:15.400 --> 01:20:16.400
Martin O'Donnell is a Halo composer.

01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:18.040
Yeah, I heard it didn't end well between him and Bungie.

01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:22.000
I remember that came up on the show a while ago, but, um, yeah, or actually it was Activision

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
more, but anyway.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:25.000
All right.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:28.400
Uh, let's, uh, let's move on.

01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:31.900
Just got a couple more stories for you guys before we get to the classic game of the week,

01:20:31.900 --> 01:20:32.900
Loki.

01:20:32.900 --> 01:20:33.900
I don't get this.

01:20:33.900 --> 01:20:39.100
This is kind of stupid, but, um, you know, there's this whole Overwatch league, um, that,

01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:43.660
you know, it's their esports league that they were trying to trademark their logo, which

01:20:43.660 --> 01:20:49.740
has Tracer and it's kind of like, you know, the multicolored logos you see for like several

01:20:49.740 --> 01:20:50.740
sports franchises.

01:20:50.740 --> 01:20:56.340
And well, one of those sports franchises, Major League Baseball, is saying, hey, it's

01:20:56.340 --> 01:20:58.440
too similar to our logo.

01:20:58.440 --> 01:21:00.320
You can't trademark this.

01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:04.800
So they filed an appeal, but they haven't, they filed an extension on their appeal, but

01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:07.840
they haven't yet filed an appeal for it and the deadline's actually coming up in about

01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:08.840
three days.

01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:13.420
But it doesn't look anything like the fucking Major League Baseball logo and besides on

01:21:13.420 --> 01:21:19.080
top of that, I think if you have any qualms against any sort of logo like that, then what

01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:20.640
about Major League Gaming?

01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:22.760
I mean, come on.

01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:24.600
That's more of a rip off of that than anything.

01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:27.460
And they're like, what about the NBA has the same type of thing or NHL?

01:21:27.460 --> 01:21:31.660
I mean, there's like a ton of fucking logos out there that look all the same.

01:21:31.660 --> 01:21:38.380
It is also pretty clear to me that in one logo, the person is holding a baseball bat

01:21:38.380 --> 01:21:41.460
and the other logo, the person is holding a gun.

01:21:41.460 --> 01:21:43.100
It's also different colors.

01:21:43.100 --> 01:21:44.740
It's also different fonts.

01:21:44.740 --> 01:21:49.220
Also the, the way the words are lined up is different.

01:21:49.220 --> 01:21:52.620
It's just sounds like, hmm, up and coming popular.

01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:54.160
Is MLB afraid of something?

01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:56.360
Yeah, I think so.

01:21:56.360 --> 01:21:57.360
Sounds like it.

01:21:57.360 --> 01:22:02.760
After all, we had Evo on ESPN on Sunday night.

01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:04.920
They're pulling higher numbers in some of their games.

01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:08.120
So just, I don't know, just, just theorize.

01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:10.640
I guess we'll have to follow and see what happens with this.

01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:15.480
Hopefully they won't file any sort of, um, appeal.

01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:19.900
So they're, like I said, the deadline for their submission has to be the 26th.

01:22:19.900 --> 01:22:24.780
And so if they don't file anything, then there's no opposition and they're going to basically

01:22:24.780 --> 01:22:26.960
just allow them to have that.

01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:27.960
All right.

01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:32.000
Well, a little more for you here before we get to the classic game of the week, but this

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:35.800
is about a classic game and this all seems to be happening all at once.

01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:40.520
I don't know if this is because of the Castlevania and how well that's been doing on Netflix,

01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:43.160
but Jason mentioned at the intro at the top of the show tonight, there's been kind of

01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:45.000
a flood of this media stuff this week.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:46.620
And yeah, there has been.

01:22:46.620 --> 01:22:50.340
Get this, Galaga of all things.

01:22:50.340 --> 01:22:51.340
That's right.

01:22:51.340 --> 01:22:55.720
The old 80s Namco game, Galaga, supposed to be made into a animated series.

01:22:55.720 --> 01:22:56.720
That's right.

01:22:56.720 --> 01:23:01.420
Sweden, uh, an LA based production company, the Nuttery Entertainment, the Nuttery, send

01:23:01.420 --> 01:23:02.420
them to the Nuttery.

01:23:02.420 --> 01:23:06.800
Uh, they're developing an animated series and other extensions of the Galaga brand.

01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:10.840
They've signed an agreement with bound by Namco, uh, which, uh, you know, obviously

01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:13.140
made Galaga and Galaxian and all that.

01:23:13.140 --> 01:23:16.120
They're trying to develop new characters and stories based on Galaga, including an

01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:20.720
animated series titled Galaga Chronicles, huh?

01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:25.420
So yeah, a quote there, we're incredibly honored to be able to work on such an amazing legacy

01:23:25.420 --> 01:23:28.440
property and help launch it into the animated space.

01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:30.440
So it could be interesting.

01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:34.200
Um, Dar Sakura, I know you're a fan of Namco stuff.

01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:36.400
Uh, would you watch a Galaga cartoon?

01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:37.400
Sure.

01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:38.640
I watched a Salamander anime.

01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:39.640
Hmm.

01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:40.640
All right.

01:23:41.640 --> 01:23:44.660
Would you watch one based on Splatoon?

01:23:44.660 --> 01:23:47.020
Because Splatoon is going to get one too.

01:23:47.020 --> 01:23:48.020
What's that?

01:23:48.020 --> 01:23:49.020
I haven't played any Splatoon.

01:23:49.020 --> 01:23:50.020
It's cute.

01:23:50.020 --> 01:23:52.660
I think, I think, I think Splatoon would make a good anime.

01:23:52.660 --> 01:23:54.520
I think it's a good like kid thing.

01:23:54.520 --> 01:23:59.740
Like I know we always taunt Nintendo at being like the kiddie company, but let's be real.

01:23:59.740 --> 01:24:02.440
Like they made a first person, well, you know what I mean?

01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:04.460
Over the shoulder shooter or whatever you want to call it.

01:24:04.460 --> 01:24:06.800
That isn't really a shooter, but it is.

01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:11.480
And it's a game that's like really fun for adults and kids can get into it.

01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:15.080
So it's not overly violent and I don't see any faults there now.

01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:18.260
No, I mean, so like, yeah, Nintendo kind of hit the money on this.

01:24:18.260 --> 01:24:22.040
So it makes a lot of sense that Splatoon is going to get an anime spinoff.

01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:27.080
Uh, it is being reported by Korokoro that the series will premiere on the Korokoro YouTube

01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:29.720
page on August 12th.

01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:33.280
There already is a Splatoon manga in magazine form.

01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:36.760
So it just makes sense that the anime is going to follow suit.

01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:38.480
There had been one for Metroid back in the day.

01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:42.520
Oh, they made a manga for Metroid.

01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:46.800
That a lot of the story points from the manga ended up in like super Metroid and some of

01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:48.840
the other Metroid games.

01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:52.800
Well then it could be interesting to see what develops with, uh, especially with how popular

01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:55.080
some of those Splatoon characters are really popular.

01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:57.960
Like seriously, just look up Pearl and Marina.

01:24:57.960 --> 01:25:04.600
Well, the, the NES version of Strider was based off of a manga based off the arcade

01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:05.600
version.

01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:06.600
Right.

01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:10.680
Because that's why the Sega and Nintendo ones, even though they're both Strider are so different.

01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:11.680
Exactly.

01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:12.680
Excellent.

01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:18.760
Uh, anyhow, uh, well it may not be Metroid, but another classic game, uh, again, sounds

01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:21.920
like it's moving forward, is a Mega Man movie.

01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:25.800
Now, we first heard about this two years ago, but some movement happened.

01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:27.360
It's not in development hell anymore.

01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:30.260
It's in the final stages of negotiations to write and direct.

01:25:30.260 --> 01:25:34.280
Sharon in entertainment, I hope I'm saying that right, is the producer behind this.

01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:42.880
The directors of the catfish film, we'll be heading up the project, but heroes actor

01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:47.360
Masi Oka, who played like that, uh, what was his name in heroes?

01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:48.360
Hero.

01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:49.360
Hero.

01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:50.360
Okay.

01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:51.360
Thank you.

01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:53.120
I just remember he was the guy in the trailer in Times Square going, I did it.

01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:56.040
Honestly, he was one of the best parts of George Takei played his dad.

01:25:56.040 --> 01:25:57.040
Yeah.

01:25:57.040 --> 01:25:58.040
Yeah.

01:25:58.040 --> 01:26:01.320
Like the key was, he was the hero in that show, literally.

01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:05.360
But anyway, uh, so he's involved with that, which I remember that was because he had done,

01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:06.720
he wasn't always an actor.

01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:10.640
Well, I guess that was always something he kind of did, but he was like a sci-fi, uh,

01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:12.280
FX guy before that.

01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:13.280
Wasn't he?

01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:14.280
I still remember reading about that.

01:26:14.280 --> 01:26:15.280
Yeah.

01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:18.360
I think he made that transition from that to like doing the acting in that show.

01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:20.520
And then obviously he was very popular in that show.

01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:25.400
Anyway, no idea when the film itself will be coming out, but I'm sure plenty more information

01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:26.400
will be out there.

01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:30.480
Uh, so it doesn't suck like the cartoon looks cause that cartoon looks like shit.

01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:32.200
Is that cartoon even come out yet?

01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:37.480
I thought we saw trailers, but why don't we have seen trailers for, but I thought it was

01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:38.480
early 2018 for that.

01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:39.480
I don't know.

01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:40.480
All right.

01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:41.480
All right.

01:26:41.480 --> 01:26:42.480
Well, anyhow.

01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:43.480
Well, it looks weird.

01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:44.480
I was just like, sorry.

01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:45.480
Just interrupt again.

01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:55.160
Um, we have all these like, oh yeah, movies and cartoon game, game, anywhere it's like

01:26:55.160 --> 01:26:57.080
fucking hot topic in invader Zim.

01:26:57.080 --> 01:27:00.160
Oh, let's put out all the fucking invaders in merchandise, but fuck you.

01:27:00.160 --> 01:27:04.920
We're not giving you another show until of course new Nintendo Rocko's modern life fucking

01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:11.720
trailer for that looks awesome, but yeah, I mean the movie is nice.

01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:14.780
I guess it's good to test the waters to see if it's something to bring back.

01:27:14.780 --> 01:27:17.440
I think Mark Rocco's modern life would be good in invader Zim.

01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:18.880
I'm all for that.

01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:19.880
Come on.

01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:20.880
No Gus.

01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:23.920
In our chat over at live.vognetware.com says I want to kid Icarus reboot so that I can

01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:26.120
cosplay as eggplant wizard.

01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:29.240
A you can already cosplay as eggplant wizard if you want.

01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:31.080
I think the eggplant wizard was iconic enough.

01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:32.080
Okay.

01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:33.080
Eggplant wizard was in captain in, right?

01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:34.080
If I remember, right?

01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:35.080
Uh, yes.

01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:36.080
I think so.

01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:37.080
Yes.

01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:38.080
It also was iconic enough for the game and was also terrible.

01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:41.720
But B I just want to remind you the eggplant wizard and the eggplant emoji have nothing

01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:42.720
in common.

01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:45.600
So just if that's where you're going with that, just, just, just a little word of caution

01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:49.600
for the eggplant wizard to be a perfect character for another smash game.

01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:50.600
I think so.

01:27:50.600 --> 01:27:53.760
I think the eggplant wizard would be, I think, I think, I think that the eggplant wizard

01:27:53.800 --> 01:27:54.800
is a good character.

01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:55.800
And the dude from Actraiser.

01:27:55.800 --> 01:27:56.800
Do, do for a comeback.

01:27:56.800 --> 01:27:57.800
Yes.

01:27:57.800 --> 01:27:58.800
Dude from Actraiser.

01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:00.520
Uh, eggplant wizard.

01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:03.680
We need to, maybe this is a list list we need to do in the future.

01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:07.360
The, the character that's due for a fucking comeback.

01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:09.640
Just like we had Duck Hunt, right?

01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:12.360
We had that fucking dog came back in smash.

01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:13.680
Character due for a comeback via smash.

01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:15.240
How about another Duck Hunt game?

01:28:15.240 --> 01:28:18.160
There's all these properties they can bring back.

01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:19.280
Yeah.

01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:20.840
I like that.

01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:23.080
We're going to do that on a future show I think.

01:28:23.080 --> 01:28:24.080
Character due for a comeback.

01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:28.320
In fact, if you're going to see NES classic edition two, I would be happy, I mean, I don't

01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:32.360
know how they would do a light gun game, but it would be cool to see with the zapper in

01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:34.160
there and have all the light gun games in there.

01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:35.160
All right.

01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:39.120
Let's travel back to a simpler time when we were playing games that featured eggplants

01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:41.040
and there was nothing wrong with that.

01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:44.000
The classic game of the week.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:48.960
Dark soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey,

01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:54.440
brat, play this game or I'll turn you into an eggplant.

01:28:54.440 --> 01:28:55.440
Sorry, Sakura.

01:28:55.440 --> 01:28:56.440
What is it?

01:28:56.440 --> 01:28:58.000
Eggplants are kind of good though, actually.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.840
I actually make eggplant parmesan really nicely.

01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:05.440
My grandmother used to make it for me, so believe it or not, I have a lot of fond memories

01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:06.440
attached to eggplants.

01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:07.440
You know what I'm saying?

01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:08.440
It's one of those things...

01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:10.120
Sorry, I can't help it.

01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:11.120
It's one of those things that people...

01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:12.120
Not those kind of memories.

01:29:12.120 --> 01:29:17.520
It's one of those things that people love or they hate, but I find that I really like

01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:18.520
eggplant.

01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:20.080
Go figure.

01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:23.080
Okay, eggplant emoji.

01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:24.080
Classic game of the week.

01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:25.080
Dark Sakura.

01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:27.080
What should the kids be playing this week?

01:29:27.080 --> 01:29:33.920
Senkoku or as it was in Japan, Senkoku Densho, which was a legacy of the Warring States to

01:29:33.920 --> 01:29:34.920
translate.

01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:36.200
Oh, it's a Neo Geo game.

01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:38.560
I love the Neo Geo startup logo.

01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:39.560
That's right.

01:29:39.560 --> 01:29:40.560
Let's have a moment.

01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:41.560
Rob, start it over.

01:29:41.560 --> 01:29:42.560
We just heard it.

01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:43.560
Do it.

01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:44.560
Fine.

01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:45.560
Jamie made me.

01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:54.160
I hear that every time I turn on my Neo Geo.

01:29:54.160 --> 01:29:57.560
Everybody now.

01:29:57.560 --> 01:29:59.120
Sweet relief.

01:29:59.120 --> 01:30:06.880
Anyways, Senkoku actually was a series of games that were put out by SNK.

01:30:06.880 --> 01:30:12.480
It had several different ports and releases that came out.

01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:17.560
The original, of course, was for the Neo Geo arcade system.

01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:19.880
And that also means that we had...

01:30:19.880 --> 01:30:31.280
So then that was also the Neo Geo AVS, MVS, Neo Geo CD, Mega CD, and Super Famicom versions

01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:34.200
that apparently were...

01:30:34.200 --> 01:30:36.840
Some of them were canceled in North America.

01:30:36.840 --> 01:30:42.280
The arcade version was rereleased as SNK Arcade Classics Volume 1 in part of it.

01:30:42.280 --> 01:30:47.720
And the Neo Geo version was rereleased for Virtual Console in 2001 with the sequels also

01:30:47.720 --> 01:30:54.480
coming to Virtual Console, Senkoku 2, Senkoku 3 for US and PAL regions.

01:30:54.480 --> 01:30:59.200
And then in 2009 for PS2 and Windows, there was Senkoku Anthology.

01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:08.640
So basically, I like this game and I had forgotten about it until I watched a video review yesterday.

01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:13.200
It almost kind of makes me think of Samurai Troopers.

01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:15.200
You remember that anime?

01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:18.880
Over here we got it as Ronin Warriors.

01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:27.880
It kind of makes me think a little bit of it because you have this dark undead dimension

01:31:27.880 --> 01:31:37.960
that's still based in feudal Japan, or at least the mythology around it is, who come

01:31:37.960 --> 01:31:41.200
to the modern world or the dimension train at crossover.

01:31:41.200 --> 01:31:50.840
And your two heroes are a ninja named Dave, in the US version, or in the Neo Geo version,

01:31:50.840 --> 01:31:57.680
and a cowboy named Keld, although in the SNES one, they were Dan and Bill respectively,

01:31:57.680 --> 01:32:06.880
who were descendants of the original samurai who banished the asshole warlord back when.

01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:14.320
So you start off with six health points, and then after you beat certain enemies, you

01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:20.640
get these powerful forms that you can transform into, that you can toggle which one you go

01:32:20.640 --> 01:32:24.880
into, although in the SNES one you can't.

01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:31.240
You've got a wolf form, you have a ninja form, you have a samurai form, and they've got their

01:32:31.240 --> 01:32:34.440
own special power-ups that go on along with the game.

01:32:34.440 --> 01:32:42.880
But the neat thing about this game is that you can hit these warp areas that take you

01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:50.920
from a modern day, or by modern I mean 1991 setting, and send you into this mythical feudal

01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:55.360
Japanese setting.

01:32:55.360 --> 01:33:00.320
Banners broken in the background, and even the music changes, and the music in this game

01:33:00.320 --> 01:33:01.600
is freaking great.

01:33:01.600 --> 01:33:06.760
It actually has one of my favorite game soundtracks.

01:33:06.760 --> 01:33:10.520
And on top of that, one of the things in the arcade version is that there is a reference

01:33:10.520 --> 01:33:16.600
to the game Athena, where- Neo Geo has a lot of subtle references to that game, it really

01:33:16.600 --> 01:33:17.600
do.

01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:18.600
Well, it was another SNK game.

01:33:18.600 --> 01:33:19.960
Yeah, no, I know, I know, it was like one of their first, yeah.

01:33:19.960 --> 01:33:25.560
But it even has dress shop Athena, and it's in the Athena font, with a schoolgirl dressed

01:33:25.560 --> 01:33:29.360
on a mannequin in the background, it's pretty cool.

01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:34.240
So anyway, as you go through the game, you have to survive being attacked by the enemies

01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:35.960
and collect your power-ups.

01:33:35.960 --> 01:33:42.600
Five green orbs will heal one health point, and a red orb will give you a single sword,

01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:48.640
a cyan one will give you a double sword, and the purple one gives you a two-handed holy

01:33:48.640 --> 01:33:56.440
sword, and a yellow one will give you a magic attack.

01:33:56.440 --> 01:34:04.800
And now here's the bad thing, as much as I would love to love on the SNES one, it actually

01:34:04.800 --> 01:34:11.000
suffers from a lot of the limitations of having a slower processor.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:15.640
On top of that, the music really isn't all that great, although the SNES can do a pretty

01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:18.320
decent shakuhachi sound.

01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:24.160
Anyway, of course the Neo Geo version is perfect, the Neo CD version is perfect.

01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:33.320
The only thing that I remembered as being a problem with the arcade one is that it played

01:34:33.320 --> 01:34:39.240
kind of sluggishly anyway, and of course the Super Famicom one was even worse.

01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:42.860
Now the Mega Drive one, because I had never played the Mega Drive one, but I was watching

01:34:42.860 --> 01:34:51.840
the review of it, and the same company that did the port of it had done plenty of other

01:34:51.840 --> 01:34:56.200
games, and it looks like it plays fine, the music is there, the music is the arcade music

01:34:56.200 --> 01:35:03.160
because it's Mega CD, it just doesn't have as beautiful as a color palette.

01:35:03.160 --> 01:35:11.040
But I think the music in this game is absolutely wonderful, and the game itself, it has a lot

01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:16.000
of good things going on for it, it just needs to be a little bit more fun to play.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:22.400
But for one of those, it was really I think ambitious in terms of story, and the design

01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:29.040
of the game, and the way that it played, and as you went through various different settings,

01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:31.680
it's just very fascinating.

01:35:31.680 --> 01:35:34.320
Shame it just wasn't more fun to play, that's all.

01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:37.080
But that's the game, Sengoku Densho.

01:35:37.080 --> 01:35:43.880
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, a Neo Geo classic, Sengoku.

01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:47.160
Let's hear it one more time, Darkstalker, one more time, one more time.

01:35:47.160 --> 01:35:48.160
Okay.

01:35:48.160 --> 01:36:01.360
We just need a collection of those for bumpers, like that remixed with the old Capcom Q sound.

01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:04.680
Yeah, all the old start-up noises, the GameCube, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

01:36:04.680 --> 01:36:08.360

with more of orange lounge radio right after this

01:36:32.280 --> 01:36:37.360
welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio live tonight on this sunday night with episode

01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:45.680
number 695 of our show we're just a few episodes away from 700 if you can believe it uh if

01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:49.160
you are just joining us here live you've missed a lot of chat like earlier in the show

01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:53.480
we were talking about the pokemon go fest and our buddy charles from the pokemon go

01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:57.600
podcast was actually here and uh i've been talking to him a little bit on twitter even

01:36:57.600 --> 01:37:01.520
though i obviously couldn't be here live tonight but he did want to mention that uh he did

01:37:01.520 --> 01:37:04.800
have some videos that he took the event if you want to check that out it's over on their

01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:09.280
facebook page so just check it out over at facebook.com slash pokemon go podcast you

01:37:09.280 --> 01:37:13.960
can check out those videos uh in the meantime we're gonna get back into some rapid fire

01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:23.720
news loki so here's some new fodder for nintendo to dmca um smit there's a smash brothers fan

01:37:23.720 --> 01:37:29.520
game called super clash brothers it basically takes the characters in smash brothers and

01:37:29.520 --> 01:37:34.720
puts them in their wonderful 8 and 16 bit iterations and then of course there's a whole

01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:38.840
game based on that so this one they've only got a few characters so far you've got mario

01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:46.760
luigi princess peach link sonic tales knuckles and mega man and of course you know every

01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:51.480
character looks just like their you know sprite versions and i think even operates sort of

01:37:51.480 --> 01:37:57.440
like their sprite versions as well so it's available to check out online until of course

01:37:57.440 --> 01:38:03.520
it is um you know taken down by nintendo eventually so that would be terrible um the other fun

01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:10.720
thing there's a new mod for link to the past allows two people to share items online so

01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:16.640
i guess it's somehow it it adds some some special code to allow a couple players to

01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:24.040
actually coordinate items through the progress of the game and can change each other's inventory

01:38:24.040 --> 01:38:31.160
that's kind of kind of weird um and they're saying that even i guess you can communicate

01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:37.920
with your teams over skype and stuff um that's definitely a unique mod for that too bad it's

01:38:37.920 --> 01:38:44.080
not like co-op though in zelda that'd be pretty cool yeah it's kind of a bummer they don't

01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:47.360
like officially release something like that that's like when they like put multiplayer

01:38:47.360 --> 01:38:51.320
in skyrim with a mod you know something that people kind of wanted but bethesda didn't

01:38:51.320 --> 01:38:56.920
i guess think the balance would work right but at modders to the rescue right yeah so

01:38:57.160 --> 01:39:03.160
neat well uh maybe uh maybe ubisoft will be looking at a zelda-like game on the nintendo

01:39:03.160 --> 01:39:07.320
switch who knows what they're working on we don't know but ubisoft has said that they are working

01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:11.800
on more titles for nintendo switch this is during a recent earnings call but of course no more

01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:16.440
details just that the games will be announced soon we don't know if they're ports we don't know if

01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:21.080
they're new games all together or like you know new uh platforms for games that are scheduled

01:39:21.080 --> 01:39:25.800
to come out like maybe the south park game but that's you know obviously i'm i'm totally making

01:39:25.800 --> 01:39:30.520
shit up right now um but we'll see we'll find out i would imagine gamescom might be a good time in

01:39:30.520 --> 01:39:35.000
the near future to announce that stuff obviously i would imagine yeah ubisoft has a lot of operations

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:40.440
in france uh so that's only a few weeks away yeah so that'll be a good time but we'll see we'll see

01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:46.440
uh but that would make a lot of sense uh also could the end of me verse be coming um i guess

01:39:46.440 --> 01:39:50.280
it would make a lot of sense after all since the wii u has kind of been kicked to the curb at this

01:39:50.280 --> 01:39:56.360
point nintendo did do an update to the wii u this update contains text now keep in mind this text

01:39:56.360 --> 01:40:00.200
is not displayed on the screen somebody's gone through the files and found this that says the

01:40:00.200 --> 01:40:04.680
me verse service has ended me verse and any software features that make use of me verse

01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:09.080
are now unavailable again nintendo has announced anything official yet it's just it seems like the

01:40:09.080 --> 01:40:13.560
wording is in there in their most recent software updates that's really all we know right now

01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:19.800
but again i mean it kind of makes sense that it would go away except it's it's on the 3ds as well

01:40:19.800 --> 01:40:24.600
and the 3ds is still supported by me just you know break it for the wii u i want to know what

01:40:24.600 --> 01:40:28.680
this breaks so when they get rid of this what's this going to break everything is it going to

01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:32.440
break like mario maker i mean how does that work yeah i don't know if it breaks mario maker and

01:40:32.440 --> 01:40:39.480
splatoon or what happens with that um and how far out is it it could be maybe this is the last major

01:40:39.480 --> 01:40:43.400
system patch for the wii u or something and so they're putting that text in there preemptively

01:40:43.400 --> 01:40:52.360
i don't know but again this is all still really premature so all right uh moving on dark sakura

01:40:53.400 --> 01:41:00.280
well um we know we uh all enjoy our super mario maker at least we some of us are still giving it

01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:04.680
the time of day yeah i did uh i did the post show stream last week was mario maker we had a lot of

01:41:04.680 --> 01:41:14.680
fun well now um a fan has made a mario 64 maker basically um you use your camera perspective and

01:41:14.680 --> 01:41:20.520
put things where you want and you would play them through emulation or through you know like

01:41:20.520 --> 01:41:30.680
a rom writer or something so pretty neat um it is available um online um you just have to look it up

01:41:31.480 --> 01:41:39.080
um and you know before someone takes it down so and in other news for folks who are fans of

01:41:39.080 --> 01:41:45.400
ultra street fighter 2 they have released now or figured out how to play as shin akuma

01:41:46.200 --> 01:41:54.040
or as he was in japan goki so to do this you choose you highlight color one press cancel

01:41:54.040 --> 01:41:58.200
then choose ken highlight number uh color nine then press cancel

01:41:58.200 --> 01:42:04.200
choose sagat highlight color eight then press cancel choose m bison highlight color seven

01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:09.800
press cancel highlight the random select then press l and r simultaneously good lord you have

01:42:09.800 --> 01:42:17.080
to do that each time you want to play oh oh that's fucking hell that's stupid so well it's an arcade

01:42:17.080 --> 01:42:21.800
ish thing to do i guess no it's stupid it's an arcade thing arcade ish thing to do in an arcade

01:42:21.880 --> 01:42:27.400
that has no sort of like static memory to know that it's updated you know an unlock or something

01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:35.560
like that that's on capcom not nintendo that is just stupid all right well anyhow i do want to

01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:39.480
go to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com because some interesting uh insight the me verse thing

01:42:39.480 --> 01:42:43.800
really struck a chord with a lot of people in chat uh when we were talking about that uh jd

01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:49.160
and chat says the my nintendo thing still gives weekly me verse check-ins i don't expect them to

01:42:49.160 --> 01:42:54.840
disable that until they roll out switch rewards on my nintendo uh act dev points out there's a me

01:42:54.840 --> 01:43:03.160
verse stage in smash wii u so uh let's see uh also in chat at live.vognetwork.com dark tetsuya

01:43:03.160 --> 01:43:08.040
theorizes maybe it'll tie into nintendo's new online maybe have a me verse style service on

01:43:08.040 --> 01:43:12.920
switch well what's interesting to see if you haven't already seen splatoon 2 kind of built

01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:17.160
its own me verse within the game and that's where you're seeing a lot of these pictures that look a

01:43:17.160 --> 01:43:22.200
lot like me verse show up but they're just kind of embedded in splatoon 2 so that's kind of weird

01:43:22.200 --> 01:43:27.560
but anyway uh dark tetsuya saying about the code by the way what i thought really neat about this

01:43:27.560 --> 01:43:34.920
code this is the street fighter code is the color numbers spell out 1987 get it and hey to be fair

01:43:34.920 --> 01:43:39.400
you have to do the same type of thing to unlock akuma in street fight excuse me street fighter

01:43:39.400 --> 01:43:45.640
originally so i remember all the drama you had to go through to unlock roll it is it is it is

01:43:45.640 --> 01:43:49.080
one of those things that once you do it once it should kind of be permanent but whatever all right

01:43:49.080 --> 01:43:55.240
anyway enough of that let's talk about what is out in stores this week starting with the us loki so we

01:43:55.240 --> 01:44:00.280
have a few things coming out this week um starting off with avon colony that's coming out on pc

know this is gonna be about somebody is trying to get me to fucking rant tonight read it okay

01:48:55.720 --> 01:49:02.040
hello humanoids there's a link to a twitter thing on friday nintendo announced the next

01:49:02.120 --> 01:49:08.120
platoon 2 splatfest battle will be team mayo versus team ketchup to which sky remarked

01:49:10.360 --> 01:49:17.240
fuck off this is disgusting and an attack and i stand by my statement personally i just think

01:49:17.240 --> 01:49:22.920
it's fucking stupid can you agree of any other fucking stupid splatfest battles they could do

01:49:22.920 --> 01:49:29.320
how about team pinot noir versus team savignon block uh stable stay black writer dude i would

01:49:29.320 --> 01:49:34.440
participate i i think a good splatfest would be team red wines versus white wines i think that's

01:49:34.440 --> 01:49:37.880
a decent one worth having except that this is supposed to be a kids game but they can find a

01:49:37.880 --> 01:49:41.880
creative way to word it like what's your favorite grape you like red grapes or white grapes that's

01:49:41.880 --> 01:49:47.720
how you do it it would be and i think it's team box wine versus team bottle wine i it's all

01:49:47.720 --> 01:49:52.840
delicious i just want to remind people the reason why i feel so strongly about this is i really

01:49:52.840 --> 01:49:58.440
fucking hate mayonnaise and what what drives me bonkers about it is that it's not this well it

01:49:58.440 --> 01:50:05.720
isn't it isn't splatfest itself this is an excuse for people to tag me on twitter talking about team

01:50:05.720 --> 01:50:12.440
mayo and i'm just like shut up it's not fun i don't know if i'd be comfortable with a lot of

01:50:12.440 --> 01:50:19.080
squid shooting substances that are similar to mayo around in that game you know what i hate ketchup

01:50:19.080 --> 01:50:24.360
well here here's here's the thing i'm i i don't even really like ketchup i guess i'm team ketchup

01:50:24.360 --> 01:50:30.680
by default but i am with the emailer i am team this is just ridiculous in general but i i'm only

01:50:30.680 --> 01:50:38.040

i'm gonna fucking make plans the first weekend of august i am doing something other than splatfest

01:51:39.480 --> 01:51:46.600
what let's go to a museum i would i team art team art let's go to the rosa crucial museum read a

01:51:46.600 --> 01:51:50.280
book we're going to sit we're going to san jose and we're going to go to the rosa crucial team

01:51:50.360 --> 01:51:55.080
science win that time oh that's right they did an art versus science thing didn't they god damn it

01:51:55.080 --> 01:52:00.600
all right anyway hi olr it's reginator again with another seemingly random question thank you for

01:52:00.600 --> 01:52:09.640
saving us he said semen you know is it seemingly why don't they just do team tits and team ass

01:52:09.640 --> 01:52:14.040
why don't they just do that is uh team i want to see the shirts to come along with that one

01:52:14.040 --> 01:52:19.000
why can't you have both can we get like the like the boob like hats you know that they have

01:52:19.640 --> 01:52:23.880
so what would it be team dick versus team ass no why not team tits and ass

01:52:23.880 --> 01:52:30.760
team no no we need team dick too there are plenty of women that would still pick tits

01:52:30.760 --> 01:52:37.240
there are not many men who have boobs like that all right team we'll do uh team eggplant emoji

01:52:37.240 --> 01:52:43.400
versus team peach emoji okay okay okay okay so we'll have one week of team tits and ass and one

01:52:43.400 --> 01:52:47.880
tea tea week of peach emoji and i'll just i'll just set them all up i'll set them all up okay

01:52:47.880 --> 01:52:52.680
because nintendo can't possibly handle the i love this idea what we should do on the show

01:52:53.320 --> 01:52:57.160
if we i'm sorry to derail the email but you know what this is far more important than whatever sale

01:52:57.160 --> 01:53:03.720
he's going to talk about so love your agent here so here's the thing i think when splatfest is lame

01:53:04.280 --> 01:53:13.400
we replace it and we say these are the new teams we overrule nintendo and their inferior online

01:53:13.400 --> 01:53:19.160
system and we are officially overruling this week's team mayo like they could have done

01:53:19.160 --> 01:53:27.000
instead of mayo and ketchup they could have done alfredo and marinara okay oh and i would still

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:31.880
i would still be team marinara so anyway so but i think we should overthrow with team peach emoji

01:53:31.880 --> 01:53:36.440
and team uh eggplant emoji that's a good one pesto versus marinara that even better anyway

01:53:37.320 --> 01:53:44.040
i was just gonna break it but but but but i also will go out and and say there are men with nice

01:53:44.040 --> 01:53:51.320
racks sure but i'm just saying it's not exactly and there's men with great asses just saying

01:53:51.960 --> 01:53:58.360
it's all about the hip groove that's it okay so reginator talking about sales um

01:53:59.240 --> 01:54:04.440
obviously most of us within the vog community enjoy video games to one extent or another

01:54:04.440 --> 01:54:11.880
be it on console handheld or pc can't stand them but obviously we all don't have the time and or

01:54:11.880 --> 01:54:17.080
energy to play games nearly as much as we would probably like and for various reasons that being

01:54:17.080 --> 01:54:23.160
said is there any gaming specific gaming related media that you all like and make use of to fill

01:54:23.160 --> 01:54:32.600
the void and what specifically um my iphone gaming related media i guess podcasts just

01:54:32.600 --> 01:54:38.760
will pop yeah that goes without saying i just have my iphone yeah iphone is awfully convenient

01:54:38.760 --> 01:54:45.080
i catch the pokemans at my desk gaming in your pocket and twitter and all that uh social media

01:54:45.080 --> 01:54:50.840
i think is huge it's it's good and it's bad you know obviously there's a lot of good that comes

01:54:50.840 --> 01:54:55.480
from social media and there's a lot of garbage so it's just kind of one of those depending on what

01:54:55.480 --> 01:54:59.480
color glasses you're wearing on twitter i found a youtube channel that i absolutely fall in love

01:54:59.480 --> 01:55:05.320
with and it's relaxing nintendo music which has like our tracks of nothing but the most relaxing

01:55:05.320 --> 01:55:10.760
tracks from different games i like that i like three hour youtubes of people dissecting a two

01:55:10.760 --> 01:55:15.560
minute pokemon trailer that was something shane introduced me to i was like wow this is uh this

01:55:15.560 --> 01:55:22.200
is something i just discovered and i'm like it's our it's basically our show i discovered a channel

01:55:22.200 --> 01:55:27.960
i think it's called like totally not jake who does like this dragon ball power level thing

01:55:27.960 --> 01:55:32.200
and just listening that someone had the time to break down all the episodes and the manga and

01:55:32.200 --> 01:55:39.880
try to figure it out i'm like dude i'm completely listening to this fascinated wrapped even and i

01:55:39.880 --> 01:55:46.120
don't know why it's like well then usually i'm playing xenoverse at the same time so it's like

01:55:46.120 --> 01:55:50.360
it's like when you eat food and watch cartoon network not cartoon network food network why

01:55:50.360 --> 01:55:56.040
they say cartoon network or when you're like for people of that persuasion doing it while watching

01:55:56.040 --> 01:56:01.800
important sure so i kind of miss g4 tv in that sense i mean not the later years but the earlier

01:56:01.800 --> 01:56:07.560
years i missed tech and all that stuff i kind of missed that when that was more in its heyday both

01:56:07.560 --> 01:56:12.360
those channels because you know that would be like i'm gonna zone out watch food network or i'm gonna

01:56:12.360 --> 01:56:17.000
you know zone out watch uh cartoon network is like oh i can zone out watch the video game channel but

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:23.480
now it's i suppose it's twitch is kind of that now so i mean twitch is a decent answer and if

01:56:23.480 --> 01:56:27.960
when i say twitch i mean mixer i mean youtube and all of it in one big bucket but the video game

01:56:27.960 --> 01:56:33.560
social streaming is is huge obviously twitch is a generic yeah i like kleenex like clean yeah

01:56:33.560 --> 01:56:40.200
exactly uh loki really real quick gaming media i watched him i will even during work like as i'm

01:56:40.200 --> 01:56:44.760
working stuff he watches the ready player one trailer over and over and over again no i already

01:56:44.760 --> 01:56:51.560
did that today um so uh no i watch um well funny enough it's not really game really i watch a lot

01:56:51.560 --> 01:56:57.320
of red letter media because they do funny reviews of movies and i like that um but like gaming

01:56:57.320 --> 01:57:03.640
related stuff usually at home i'll watch a few different uh youtube channels so like ollie43

01:57:03.640 --> 01:57:09.080
does a lot of grants without a mod videos and just like silly shit that's just like small um i'll

01:57:09.080 --> 01:57:16.040
watch some of the replays of um awesome games on quick because those are pretty fun and then uh

01:57:16.040 --> 01:57:23.320
helix snake because of his uh skate 3 glitch videos are just fucking hilarious and um you

01:57:23.320 --> 01:57:30.920
occasionally i'll watch reviews from um oh what is it uh angry joe show although sometimes he

01:57:30.920 --> 01:57:37.240
gets on my nerves um and then i've been listening i don't know uh jim sterling the jimquisition

01:57:37.800 --> 01:57:41.560
you know i just like listening to a lot of i guess those are almost like podcasts well

01:57:42.440 --> 01:57:46.440
especially uh jim sterling show and stuff is more like a podcast but

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:50.680
i don't know i like their like opinions on stuff and it's entertaining to listen to

01:57:50.680 --> 01:57:53.720
i don't listen to a whole time podcast occasionally i'll listen to the

01:57:53.720 --> 01:57:58.520
uh completely unnecessary podcast with pat the nes punk and he talks about like stuff

01:57:58.520 --> 01:58:02.440
and retro games and things i like the one where he talks to his neighbor

01:58:04.680 --> 01:58:08.360
yeah they do that sometimes by the way it's totally not mark is the channel

01:58:08.440 --> 01:58:12.200
so i linked one of them in the chat so that people know who i was talking about

01:58:12.200 --> 01:58:15.400
i'm just going to chat because i noticed people in chat are also talking about

01:58:15.400 --> 01:58:21.480
non-gaming things they zone out to dr tsuya says i think my non-gaming thing is dead malls lol

01:58:21.480 --> 01:58:26.440

that it just came out not too long it's interstellar oh yeah i did see that it was

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:10.360
interesting anyway oh yes reginator yes for me i enjoy reading books be it physical ebooks or

01:59:10.360 --> 01:59:16.280
audiobooks based on games listen to game soundtracks and read the comics when i find them

01:59:16.280 --> 01:59:22.840
or watch twitch or reruns of old school gaming based tv shows you know i did actually read a lot

01:59:22.840 --> 01:59:29.800
of comics based on i i had the first series of street fighter comics that came out before udon

01:59:29.800 --> 01:59:39.480
was a thing the the publisher so those were pretty cool anyway i'm gonna go back and read

01:59:39.480 --> 01:59:45.880
really clear one again probably maybe good good all right that's it for our uh our mailbag tonight

01:59:45.880 --> 01:59:50.520
participate at orange laundry.com if you would like to send us an email in the future for us to

01:59:50.520 --> 01:59:57.880
read here so all right uh let's move on with some more gaming news loki so nintendo has filed a

01:59:57.960 --> 02:00:07.400
trademark application in the eu for a graphical representation of nintendo controllers including

02:00:07.400 --> 02:00:14.920
the nintendo 64 the previous time that they had done this was for the nes and the snes which

02:00:15.480 --> 02:00:23.240
you may remember have now mini systems for them so the thought is hey they're gonna release a mini

02:00:23.240 --> 02:00:30.200
n64 classic edition that you won't be able to buy maybe in 2018 or something to that effect

02:00:30.840 --> 02:00:34.600
so that might be something to look forward to what can print money next

02:00:34.600 --> 02:00:39.720
although how i mean not to be too shady but how many nintendo 64 games are going to be

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:45.880
worthy of a collection are they going to cut it down to 15 games because i'm not i i mean how

02:00:45.880 --> 02:00:52.600
many games are worth revisiting i'm sorry it sounds so shady but there's probably not quite

02:00:52.600 --> 02:00:58.360
as rich of a collection as nintendo maybe they'll put the was it animal woods or whatever the fuck

02:00:58.360 --> 02:01:04.040
that animal crossing game was originally yeah don't worry forest or whatever don't don't worry

02:01:04.040 --> 02:01:09.480
is a type of food all right eat though what you're saying that it can't be a force of it

02:01:09.560 --> 02:01:17.880
so i was close i had like two of the four syllables i don't know maybe they could put like

02:01:17.880 --> 02:01:28.360
um you know mario 64 star mark mario kart mario kart superman yeah it's all superman 64 60 30

02:01:28.360 --> 02:01:32.840
versions of it or something um i'm sure there's games that they could find on it it'd be golden

02:01:32.840 --> 02:01:36.680
eye okay come on noga says golden eye if they can get the rights for it because was it was

02:01:36.680 --> 02:01:42.920
it a nintendo that's a rare game yeah oh that might be get complicated but okay well if the

02:01:42.920 --> 02:01:47.640
rights work out yeah golden i would be that that's all they it doesn't even need anything besides

02:01:47.640 --> 02:01:54.760
banjo kazooie then and then people will fucking buy it if donkey kong 64 don't count country 64

02:01:54.760 --> 02:02:02.680
um i don't know there's lots of games all right and folks in chat rock this should be a list list

02:02:02.680 --> 02:02:09.000
maybe what god that's like three listless ideas from tonight but yeah i mean so i mean i'm curious

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:14.760
to see what kind of hardware the super nintendo ones running on because the nes classic one could

02:02:14.760 --> 02:02:21.080
play snes games genesis all that stuff and i want to say it did 64 games as well it wouldn't be

02:02:21.080 --> 02:02:26.280
surprised it's the same hardware they just keep popping in the new shells pokemon puzzle league

02:02:26.920 --> 02:02:36.200
hey you pikachu and um pokemon snap pokemon snap done but isn't hey pikachu need like a require a

02:02:36.200 --> 02:02:41.640
microphone okay if nintendo can't fucking put a two dollar microphone into these things then

02:02:41.640 --> 02:02:47.880
what's the point if i can't play hey you pikachu if nintendo can't put a voice app in their system

02:02:47.880 --> 02:02:52.440
that has you know yeah why doesn't hey you pikachu just run through an app that they're

02:02:52.520 --> 02:02:57.640
brilliant problem solved i think we need to go to a new story let's let's talk about a game that

02:02:57.640 --> 02:03:01.800
came out recently that's uh really awesome actually since i now have i don't know i've

02:03:01.800 --> 02:03:06.200
talked a lot about this on the show i finally bought a 4k monitor during the amazon prime

02:03:06.200 --> 02:03:11.800
i don't have the video card yet that can quite pump out the 4k smooth visuals but i am getting

02:03:11.800 --> 02:03:16.520
well i can do 4k video and i'm getting the 2k like i can play like that next level that's kind

02:03:16.520 --> 02:03:21.880
of in between and so i've been playing doom a little bit with that and making myself barf

02:03:21.880 --> 02:03:25.240
because that game moves so fast but it's awesome but i'm actually really happy to

02:03:25.240 --> 02:03:34.200
hear that uh bethesda is going to be doing a doom 6.66 update which will unlock all the dlc

02:03:34.200 --> 02:03:39.000
for free that's right all players are going to get all the dlc for free at least the multiplayer

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:44.440
uh dlc which i think is all there was uh it'll also change up the progression system big time

02:03:44.440 --> 02:03:48.920
because this time uh used to unlock random stuff kind of like you do in overwatch now

02:03:48.920 --> 02:03:53.800
specific items and customizations will go for different levels so you can check that out my

02:03:53.800 --> 02:03:58.600
question to you guys into our chat room is how do you feel though about that whereas i'm happy that

02:03:58.600 --> 02:04:04.360
this is going free because i never touched the dlc how do you guys feel about if you go and buy dlc

02:04:04.360 --> 02:04:09.720
for a game and then six months a year later it's free for everybody do you feel burned a little bit

02:04:09.720 --> 02:04:17.880
or a little bit i guess but whatever they've done it in other games i suppose has xbox gold

02:04:17.880 --> 02:04:23.880
or playstation the their rewards program if they ever done like dlc as a reward i don't think no

02:04:23.880 --> 02:04:29.640
but like i've seen discounts i guess i've seen them do that before though i it's not a new thing

02:04:30.680 --> 02:04:35.960
it's a rare thing because you know usually those companies are like oh let's make some money we

02:04:35.960 --> 02:04:45.240
still want money money money money right um so um i don't know it's uncommon well i want to go

02:04:45.240 --> 02:04:48.680
revisit this game now especially with all the multiplayer stuff i didn't play multiplayer

02:04:48.680 --> 02:04:52.280
enough i kind of want to try it again see if i get it looks like getting mad at like a game of

02:04:52.280 --> 02:04:55.880
the year edition comes out for something that you know it's cheaper anyways it's like you've been

02:04:55.880 --> 02:05:02.040
playing it for a while now right right whatever you can't be too bad in our shape i thought this

02:05:02.040 --> 02:05:10.600
next thing was really cool dark sakura what do you have for us well um the uh nbc uh it's actually

02:05:10.600 --> 02:05:18.920
for nbc left field uh has decided to talk about who owns the moon and they did a video using

02:05:18.920 --> 02:05:25.960
minecraft to explain who owns the moon it's actually really good the the things up on the

02:05:25.960 --> 02:05:34.360
twitter channel um uh at nbc left field and i thought it actually was pretty informative there

02:05:34.360 --> 02:05:40.120
were things that i knew but also a few things that i didn't know and it was really something

02:05:40.200 --> 02:05:46.520
that i think could be understood by all ages but uh definitely something worth a watch um

02:05:46.520 --> 02:05:53.480
for anyone in our chat room i would be more than happy to link it to you so um but it was really

02:05:53.480 --> 02:06:01.640
cute and you know the other thing is that it goes to show that um that minecraft can be an

02:06:01.640 --> 02:06:07.640
educational tool as well not just you know digging holes for stress relief like i do

02:06:07.640 --> 02:06:14.600
so i only use it for programming they've got whole classes based on minecraft for programming

02:06:14.600 --> 02:06:17.640
you know well now they have the minecraft education edition i mean this yeah this is

02:06:17.640 --> 02:06:22.120
what kids are playing in school now as opposed to oregon trail which a number munchers like we all

02:06:22.120 --> 02:06:29.080
kind of grew up with so my son this week got into roblox that thing is like weird what's that

02:06:29.080 --> 02:06:35.000
roblox is like this um knockoff it's not really a knockoff minecraft i mean it's similar graphically

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:39.640
to like a minecraft but it's basically imagine you know how they have like the different games

02:06:39.640 --> 02:06:43.560
that people can make in minecraft like the little i don't know what you call them but the hunger

02:06:43.560 --> 02:06:49.080
games mod yeah like some like mods but like imagine that that's all it is it's just these

02:06:49.080 --> 02:06:53.160
mods that you go and play different rooms and they have different games that i mean they can

02:06:53.160 --> 02:06:57.320
do the hunger games or whatever he did one that was called an ordinary elevator it had like a

02:06:57.320 --> 02:07:04.520
bunch of weird shit and it like internet meme shit like he you know first time experiencing was it you

02:07:04.680 --> 02:07:09.080
i'm a cat i'm a kitty cat and that's that sense and then says you know he's like and he thought

02:07:09.080 --> 02:07:14.920
that was hilarious i'm like wow that's super old wait so your kids are just your kids are

02:07:14.920 --> 02:07:19.080
discovering memes for the first time yeah he's discovering memes oh boy grow up so fast look out

02:07:19.080 --> 02:07:25.800
then don't go to the dancing hamster site careful because roblox has also been uh notorious for

02:07:25.800 --> 02:07:35.400
advertising via adware and for a number of numbers i'll just say be careful i'm sure he

02:07:35.400 --> 02:07:42.280
has shit already has spam on it well like it yeah it has pop-ups if he's been exposed to dank memes

02:07:42.280 --> 02:07:47.400
at such a young age it's already ruined it's already downhill from here but they have it at

02:07:47.400 --> 02:07:53.000
the library you can play roblox at the library that's where he first played it oh wow so i mean

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:59.080
if it's good enough for the public library system oh i'm sure that i'm sure nobody ever downloads

02:07:59.080 --> 02:08:05.720
garbage the public library all right uh a few more stories for you guys then we're gonna get to

02:08:05.720 --> 02:08:11.560
your calls at orange launch radio on skype but first loki so the next big marathon for twitch

02:08:11.560 --> 02:08:18.520
what could it possibly be another pbs show no we'll actually have something gaming related to it

02:08:18.600 --> 02:08:25.000
yes they're gonna be doing starcade awesome yes so they're gonna be marathoning starcade

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:31.640
and it's gonna be awesome they say why just because we can they said that their page is

02:08:31.640 --> 02:08:38.840
not gonna fucking load so is it because sometimes these events are for like charities like they did

02:08:38.840 --> 02:08:43.880
the mr rogers thing because they were trying to like actually raise money for uh uh pbs i think

02:08:43.880 --> 02:08:48.760
but uh did your period okay i got it um so they basically said this is a collaboration with the

02:08:48.760 --> 02:08:54.280
blu-ray publisher shout factory who picked up the rights and i guess maybe it's to promote the

02:08:54.280 --> 02:09:01.640
blu-rays that are gonna be coming out yeah um yes but yeah so they're gonna be running that's 130

02:09:01.640 --> 02:09:08.360
episodes it's supposed to begin on august 22nd that's awesome and i guess it's gonna be broadcast

02:09:08.360 --> 02:09:13.560
on shout factories twitch channel and i once again want to just throw my name in consideration

02:09:13.560 --> 02:09:18.520
i know i'm a nobody zero on the internet but if starcade were to ever come back i would be the

02:09:18.520 --> 02:09:23.720
best host ever of that show i'm just saying that would be my fucking dream so if anybody anybody

02:09:23.720 --> 02:09:28.120
who is anybody is out there listening please consider rob roberts starcade 2017 because i

02:09:28.120 --> 02:09:31.960
heard they were gonna bring try to bring this yeah that's what i heard too yeah so maybe this

02:09:31.960 --> 02:09:36.120
is something to kind of gauge the interest for that i don't know so i'm sure i'm sure a lot of

02:09:36.120 --> 02:09:41.880
people will be uh watching uh on twitch because i'm interested yeah me too i fucking love starcade

02:09:41.880 --> 02:09:46.200
i grew up oh man i used that was the best part of g4 like in the afternoon you know i used to

02:09:46.200 --> 02:09:54.360
come home for lunch watch an episode of starcade on g4 and eat whatever food ahead there you go

02:09:55.560 --> 02:09:59.960
all right well uh hey if you can't watch the starcade marathon maybe this is something you

02:09:59.960 --> 02:10:05.720
can listen to instead it's uh the adventures of bayou billy soundtrack that's right going back to

02:10:05.720 --> 02:10:10.760
the 8-bit nes days the adventures of bayou billy was a konami game uh that was on the nes it was

02:10:10.760 --> 02:10:16.200
actually it was actually kind of fucking terrible but it's still you know classic games are classic

02:10:16.200 --> 02:10:20.920
games and some people still remember remember some things fondly even if they weren't necessarily

02:10:20.920 --> 02:10:26.120
very good uh here's the crazy thing ship to shore photo company is hoping that fans of the original

02:10:26.120 --> 02:10:29.640
game because you know it did have a it did have one of those cool konami soundtracks and a lot

02:10:29.640 --> 02:10:33.960
of those 8-bit soundtracks uh from konami and back in the day were really cool the soundtrack

02:10:33.960 --> 02:10:39.240
is going to be coming out on a vinyl album it will have the original nes famicom soundtrack

02:10:39.240 --> 02:10:44.440
it's been remastered for vinyl it's going to have new cover art new linear notes and a special 11

02:10:44.440 --> 02:10:51.880
by 17 poster um so that's cool for fans of uh bayou billy that's awesome even if i did not really

02:10:51.880 --> 02:10:57.240
care for the game to which dark tetsuya and chat says shut your whore mouth it was fun part beat

02:10:57.240 --> 02:11:01.400
him up part driving part shooting yeah but if you actually play it none of those parts are really any

02:11:01.400 --> 02:11:09.080
good but okay if you liked it as a kid that's cool have a good time with it i'm i am happy for you

02:11:09.240 --> 02:11:12.920
and you know what the music still was good because you know again those those old uh

02:11:12.920 --> 02:11:18.040
80s konami games did have really rad music so i will give you that uh tiger claw pointing out

02:11:18.040 --> 02:11:23.000
that by you billy was made to capitalize on the success of crocodile dun d oh yeah you can you

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:28.520
can definitely see that i never drew that comparison yeah really because that's a joke

02:11:28.520 --> 02:11:34.520
okay i was like because it's kind of obvious but anyway you call that a soundtrack now that's a

02:11:34.520 --> 02:11:39.640

uh while we wait loki any quick last minute stories you want to get out yes uh so there is

it's going to nintendo switch as 90 super gp nice yep it looks awesome all right let's see if it'll

02:13:03.800 --> 02:13:08.040
work this time hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hey there's that death it worked hi

02:13:08.040 --> 02:13:13.880
act after what's on your mind buddy uh pokemon go ah yeah how was your weekend for pokemon go

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:25.160
uh it was uh kind of good i tried to uh catch uh arthacona today uh had really really bad luck

02:13:26.120 --> 02:13:29.640
oh no you didn't catch him or you weren't able to get a group together or what

02:13:30.120 --> 02:13:36.280
uh no we act i actually saw lots of people that i was kind of surprised about that and

02:13:37.240 --> 02:13:44.840
we actually did uh of the three arthacunas i participated in the race today uh we can't uh

02:13:44.840 --> 02:13:51.320
we could uh sorry we defeated two uh one of them we just couldn't because we weren't enough

02:13:52.280 --> 02:13:59.240
uh but at the time of the capture well that's just pretty tough i'll just say that um you're

02:13:59.240 --> 02:14:02.360
cutting in a little in and out so you might want to check your mic i don't know it's getting like

02:14:02.360 --> 02:14:06.680
loud and soft and loud and soft but that's always the joy of live radio is trying to fix things as

02:14:06.680 --> 02:14:12.760
we go um but yeah yeah i mean i found part of like capturing the legendary stuff um over this

02:14:12.760 --> 02:14:17.240
weekend it's just you know kind of neat how like all the people are coming together um you know it

02:14:17.240 --> 02:14:21.720
is it is tricky because you're not guaranteed to get that legendary in fact they are very hard to

02:14:21.720 --> 02:14:26.760
catch um and that makes some people kind of salty but at the same time i'm not i mean they would be

02:14:26.760 --> 02:14:32.200
legendary if they're total gimmies you know what i mean so you gotta work a little bit for it a

02:14:32.200 --> 02:14:36.360
little bit i mean you know if you've done it like nine times and still aren't catching it then

02:14:36.360 --> 02:14:40.840
that's a little much especially you know and you're paying for those raid passes but if it

02:14:40.840 --> 02:14:46.840
takes you two or three tries then that's okay i think oh yeah definitely it's uh something that

02:14:47.560 --> 02:14:54.040
that's it shouldn't be free at least and it's gonna be tough i hopefully i can still do uh

02:14:54.840 --> 02:15:01.160
this raids or that they don't uh stop showing up because that's that's something that Niantic

02:15:01.160 --> 02:15:09.880
didn't clear up since they only said oh we're going to do the double xp the the egg thing and

02:15:09.880 --> 02:15:16.120
all that stuff until monday but they didn't clarify if that also applies to uh to these

02:15:16.120 --> 02:15:22.120
raids but hopefully not yeah i don't know it would be so dumb of them to just end the legendary

02:15:22.120 --> 02:15:26.840
thing especially when we know that moltres and zapatos they're gonna happen it's just a matter

02:15:26.840 --> 02:15:31.080
of whenever niantic wants to push the button but the rules of their little challenge were never

02:15:31.080 --> 02:15:35.720
really that clear and obviously they threw it all out the window ever anyway and i kind of think we

02:15:35.720 --> 02:15:40.200
got the conclusion that was already foregone is that everything was going to get unlocked anyway

02:15:40.200 --> 02:15:44.040
but they never really made that clear which was kind of another issue with that whole event

02:15:44.040 --> 02:15:49.320
but um by the way your mic sounded much better whenever you did fix it um so i want to ask you

02:15:49.320 --> 02:15:52.200
real quick though what you think of all the stuff i don't know if you were here at the very beginning

02:15:52.200 --> 02:15:55.080
of the show when charles is here what you think of all that stuff that was going on in chicago

02:15:55.720 --> 02:16:01.960
uh i only uh well first of all i changed mics because uh i'm testing a new one but sorry about

02:16:01.960 --> 02:16:09.560
that uh i i only caught the last part of that uh because i was outside uh trying to catch an article

02:16:10.360 --> 02:16:20.120
fair excuse but yeah um i i think and i kind of agree that niantic does need to step up because

02:16:20.120 --> 02:16:26.520
yeah the game has been out for a year and i do think that they have done a lot to change the

02:16:26.520 --> 02:16:33.720
game and to fix it and to make it uh enjoyable but they do need to to step up they need to

02:16:34.280 --> 02:16:40.920
work on a lot of things uh uh like people that still have the the problems with pokemon the the

02:16:40.920 --> 02:16:49.560
plus uh uh watch i i i have heard of mine that cannot use uh her pokemon go plus because it won't

02:16:49.560 --> 02:16:57.800
connect at all and it's kind of weird and and again uh the uh some people uh there weren't many

02:16:57.800 --> 02:17:04.440
but some people today with uh on the raids were having problems uh like trying to get in the game

02:17:04.440 --> 02:17:10.680
trying to get uh getting the uh the game running all that stuff and not to mention the the people

02:17:11.480 --> 02:17:19.400
that went to the fest that that was a complete failure on their part but i did uh at least i'm

02:17:19.400 --> 02:17:25.000
kind of optimistic on this and i think that diantic can learn from from this experience

02:17:25.880 --> 02:17:34.440
and speaking of uh if should niantic uh sell or or give up pokemon go to another company

02:17:35.080 --> 02:17:44.600
uh i was looking up a phrase about this that says it's uh sorry sorry

02:17:46.920 --> 02:17:50.120
it's better the devil you know than the angel you don't

02:17:50.280 --> 02:17:58.680
i like that so so yeah you uh we uh niantic can get rid of pokemon go i they would make

02:17:58.680 --> 02:18:04.920
tons of money without selling it but i don't know if i would prefer another company handled

02:18:04.920 --> 02:18:13.640
and uh handling pokemon go uh since niantic and despite uh my probably dislike for ingress because

02:18:13.720 --> 02:18:18.680
that game i really don't don't see the appeal of playing it right now

02:18:19.560 --> 02:18:28.600
at least they know how the stuff works it's even if if niantic screws uh lots of things up i i

02:18:28.600 --> 02:18:35.240
think they at least they know their their core and they can and they can improve it and i hope

02:18:35.240 --> 02:18:40.600
they do yeah i i do you know despite my criticisms in the beginning of the show i am rooting for

02:18:40.600 --> 02:18:45.560
niantic this was just this was just a face plant of pretty epic proportions that that really should

02:18:45.560 --> 02:18:50.520
have been avoided and i get i think you're kind of right in a way is that um you know heaven forbid

02:18:50.520 --> 02:18:55.400
ea buys niantic i mean you know obviously i'm making i'm making up these completely crazy

02:18:55.400 --> 02:19:00.840
scenarios but i'm just saying you know i don't know if niantic necessarily lost money i mean

02:19:00.840 --> 02:19:04.760
yes they had to refund and so basically they had to front all the money for the park and all that

02:19:04.760 --> 02:19:10.600
but they're making money on people buying all these raid passes to do the new legendary raids

02:19:10.600 --> 02:19:15.960
so i don't know if niantic necessarily lost money on this event but there was a huge blown

02:19:15.960 --> 02:19:21.480
opportunity in that regard and uh you know somebody's got to answer for that one way or another

02:19:21.480 --> 02:19:27.800
so anyway yeah yeah definitely they're making tons of money so i i don't think there was that was uh

02:19:27.800 --> 02:19:33.560
like complete loss yeah but yeah all right well acta thank you so much for your perspective and

02:20:16.920 --> 02:20:21.400
not much i'm just gonna make this quick because i'm on my tablet and the connection's kind of

02:20:21.400 --> 02:20:26.520
funky but um i know you guys were talking about uh g4 earlier i kind of missed what the email

02:20:26.520 --> 02:20:33.080
was about but um did you know that disney disney they have a network it's called a disney xd px

02:20:33.640 --> 02:20:40.280
and i think yeah xd yeah that's what's called so they they switched that now over to what disney

02:20:40.280 --> 02:20:44.360
b xp and i think it's uh i think it's for the entire weekend i think it's from like

02:20:45.320 --> 02:20:50.120
from like friday to sunday they just do like a block a video game show from like nine and nine

02:20:50.120 --> 02:20:54.680
at night to like three in the morning really somebody shows awful but um they have some good

02:20:54.680 --> 02:21:00.440
ones in there no i want to see like is an ign show on there now or something i thought i read

02:21:00.440 --> 02:21:05.320
yeah yeah that's about to come on in a like i think in another 30 minutes they got a four

02:21:05.320 --> 02:21:09.320
ign episodes that are coming up i don't know what that show is i haven't watched it yet but um

02:21:10.360 --> 02:21:14.360
the show that i did like that did impress me a little bit even though it's still for kids

02:21:14.360 --> 02:21:19.240
and people with add there's a show called a polarized primetime and that's pretty good

02:21:19.240 --> 02:21:24.280
like basically what that is is like um what's that show that the uh the woman does she's from

02:21:24.280 --> 02:21:30.440
um she's from glee remember she did like a a game show where she's supposed to be in the living room

02:21:30.440 --> 02:21:35.560
what do you call that show oh hollywood game night yeah it's almost like that you can kind

02:21:35.560 --> 02:21:39.720
of say like they have like two celebrity guests then they have like the host and like they're

02:21:39.720 --> 02:21:43.240
all supposed to be in their living room it's supposed to be like you're having a game party

02:21:43.240 --> 02:21:47.640
or something you know like they have to guess it okay different games but um it's pretty fun and

02:21:47.640 --> 02:21:51.880
interesting the only problem with it is since it's for kids it's really hard to keep up with

02:21:51.880 --> 02:21:55.960
everything like everyone's yelling and screaming you know there's like these quick cuts and you

02:21:55.960 --> 02:22:03.160
know you're like what the fuck it's like playing mario party in my house um that's i that sounds

02:22:03.160 --> 02:22:08.040
neat i'll have to check that out i had no idea it was actually i did know of disney xd because

02:22:08.040 --> 02:22:13.800
that's where the tron phineas and ferb well there's that too but the tron um what was the

02:22:13.800 --> 02:22:20.200
tron not trom legacy tron something was the the anime yeah it was on disney xd but they aired it

02:22:20.200 --> 02:22:24.200
like friday nights or something and i don't think i got the greatest ratings on there so that's why

02:22:24.200 --> 02:22:29.400
they never did a second season but that's i was aware of tronic uh disney xd tron uprising thank

02:22:29.400 --> 02:22:34.840
you that was it so but that's neat that they do like so so kind of like how cartoon network has

02:22:34.840 --> 02:22:40.200
adult swim disney xd or whatever does a video game block late at night for the people who are up

02:22:40.200 --> 02:22:45.640
that's interesting i like that the worst show on there uh to not get into names confusing with

02:22:45.640 --> 02:22:54.680
a good show is called a polarized primetime the awful show is the polarized uh pick this player

02:22:54.680 --> 02:22:58.920
or something like that where it's just like um it's just a bunch of youtube clips uh clips all

02:22:58.920 --> 02:23:03.320
streamed together like what like they have like a box they have like a a little box with like

02:23:03.320 --> 02:23:07.960
different youtubers in it and the box just jumps around randomly picks a youtube player and you

02:23:07.960 --> 02:23:12.520
just watch like this nonsensical video that you can't even make heads or tails out of so it's

02:23:12.520 --> 02:23:20.280
you're not the right age it's a tv show all about influencers sounds like a delight right yeah

02:23:21.160 --> 02:23:27.880
yeah just terrible another great show um they uh they have like uh a fighting show i guess

02:23:27.880 --> 02:23:31.880
it's going to be like their reality show and uh each week when some i think they're playing

02:23:31.880 --> 02:23:35.640
street fighter each week when someone wins they become like the the king or something like that

02:23:35.640 --> 02:23:40.760
they sit on the throne and then the next week they have they have to uh battle um the winner

02:23:40.760 --> 02:23:44.680
out of the the next two people that play each other so they got they got a good thing going

02:23:44.680 --> 02:23:48.440
with the network you need to check that out all right i like it i like it all right kaijuto

02:27:46.520 --> 02:27:50.600
you know what that would happen i could see that polka polka ball it would be called the

02:27:50.600 --> 02:27:56.520
polka ball i love it i love it design the table by the way um i i was telling you earlier i'm

02:27:56.520 --> 02:28:03.800
going to be putting this up on youtube but right now it's on my tumblr which is kurotsubasa.tumblr.com

02:28:03.800 --> 02:28:14.040
like yeah spell it slowly k-u-r-o-u-t-s-u-b-a-s-a okay dot tumblr.com okay um i have video um we're

02:28:14.040 --> 02:28:18.680
borrowing cactus canyon right now which was a limited release pinball table toward the end of

02:28:18.680 --> 02:28:25.160
the williams you know pinball um and there's mods out for it that could make it uh into what's

02:28:25.160 --> 02:28:30.040
called cactus canyon continued that has like special skill shots and different multi-ball

02:28:30.040 --> 02:28:34.680
modes in it so we've got one in our garage right now that we're borrowing from a friend and i have

02:28:34.680 --> 02:28:41.960
video up of cowboys versus aliens multi-ball which basically goes from this crazy old west

02:28:41.960 --> 02:28:48.920
theme with you know western you know theme song type background music into freaking dubstep with

02:28:48.920 --> 02:28:54.920
shooting it is exactly that it's a skrillex song it's a remix but it's the best thing ever because

02:28:54.920 --> 02:29:02.360
it changes the whole feel of the table and it is the most fun to play so most extra it is very

02:29:02.360 --> 02:29:08.920
extra but for just it's on my tumblr so to check it out you know it's it's really a lot of fun okay

02:29:08.920 --> 02:29:12.920
cool cool all right uh i guess that's your final thought i was gonna go around and give everybody's

02:29:12.920 --> 02:29:19.400
final thought but i guess that was it that is all right my final thought is double stardust yay i

02:29:19.400 --> 02:29:23.800
need more of it because i've already spent all the stardust i got playing pokemon go today when

02:29:23.800 --> 02:29:28.280
i almost died because i was stupid and played in the heat and i walked for like two miles get a

02:29:28.280 --> 02:29:32.520
parasol i've seen a lot of pokemon go players actually do that you know what you know what you

02:29:32.520 --> 02:29:37.800
know what you should get one shaped like a star so it can be a parasol star or get one with pikachu

02:29:37.800 --> 02:29:42.760
ears on it i've seen that i know i get i get it bubble bobble parasol stars i get it okay all

02:29:42.760 --> 02:29:49.880
right uh loki last but not least your final thought uh i will try to play some games this week

02:29:49.960 --> 02:29:54.440
because i didn't play needle last week that's a good resolution to have here on this show
