Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Tonight, Pokemon Go gets a gym makeover, but is it enough to get everyone interested in the game again?

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And will everyone be interested in a Nintendo GameCube party game being released on Nintendo Switch later this month?

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We find out tonight on the show where every gamer has a voice.

Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 692 for this July the 2nd of 2017.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:55,000
My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E, joining me here in studio N7 based out of Sacramento, California.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Please say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Welcome. You doing okay over there? You sound like an evil supervillain plotting.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I feel really good right now.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Why is that?

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Because you brought me chocolate.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I did. I brought her back chocolate from Chicago, which is what she wanted.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I don't know how to pronounce this place.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
She was kitty sitting, so I said she could have anything she wanted, so of course she wanted chocolate.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I think it's Vosges Hot Chocolate. I don't know. It's something...

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
But I have heard of this place, like, for the last year or so, for longer than that.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I was like, you know what? I have to have chocolate from this place.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So I was like, I have one request.

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
There it is.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And it is the orgasm of chocolate.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Well, we found one. They had one on the...

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I want to say the Miracle Mile, the Magic Mile, I think is what it's called in Chicago, where all the big stores are.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
We actually went to a Uniqlo store that sold...

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
They have Nintendo shirts right now, and I didn't...

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I've never been in one of those stores, but that was something Alan was looking at.

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So I actually got a shirt that's just a giant Mario sprite, but it's like red.

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I kind of... Yeah, it's really cool.

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So, you know, did some shopping in Chicago.

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So, real quick, I had a great time in Chicago, and yeah, that city's always very good to me.

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Had a great time at the Pride event there.

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
How was San Francisco? You did San Francisco Pride the week we were off, right?

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's very weird walking in a cast.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Oh, did you actually get to march in the parade?

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I didn't march.

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Oh, okay. Well, I thought you did.

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Because I couldn't do that.

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It was basically a lot of standing around, but I got to meet a few other of the local Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, which was great.

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Awesome.

42
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And then... But after a while, it was like too many people, just way too many people.

43
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So we ended up going to Japantown instead.

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Oh, fun.

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And JD was with us.

46
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Yeah, as I say, our pal JD lives in that area.

47
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
He hung out with us for most of the time.

48
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Yeah, great.

49
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And we met up with my friend Liz and her wife Skirt, who I'd never met her wife before, so it was a great meeting.

50
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
We hung around, we went to Kino Kunia, and of course I found a Danganronpa V3 book.

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So I had to say, Shane, do you want this?

52
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
We've already left the store, so then I get, is it this, is it this?

53
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I bet there's a spoiler on it.

54
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I do want it, tell JD to get it for me.

55
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And I was like, I'm not walking the fuck back there.

56
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Just so you know, he officially got the book yesterday, because we saw JD yesterday on another random trip.

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So there's been lots of random trips going on.

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Yeah, and I'll get into my gaming week on this one, but Shane sat me down to play the Danganronpa V3 demo in Japanese.

59
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Nice.

60
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And I'm actually pretty proud of how much of it I understood, so gay for me.

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Before I introduce our third here, I just want to make sure the listeners know, you've been talking about the boot tonight.

62
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You are, your foot is in a cast.

63
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Yes, it's in a cast.

64
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
But you're going to be okay, you didn't like break your leg or anything.

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
No, it's not broken.

66
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I've had, and I've got a problem actually with both of my feet, but my right foot is significantly worse.

67
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Where there, I have a bunion, you know, 50% of the population has them.

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Some people have them really severely, and I am one of the ones with a really severe bunion.

69
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I actually want to get my x-rays because my feet look fucking bizarre.

70
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
No, seriously.

71
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Well, to be fair, a lot of you looks fucking bizarre.

72
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Girl, mirror.

73
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You left the door wide open for that.

74
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I am going to finish this chocolate tonight, by the way, since it only has like a week left on its life expectancy.

75
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm going to eat it tonight.

76
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Good for you.

77
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
But anyway, I'm an achiever.

78
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
But anyway, I also have heel spurs forming and problems with my Achilles tendon.

79
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So I was supposed to be wearing a boot that I could take off, but it didn't help.

80
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So now I'm in a boot for a month, but the, they took mercy on me.

81
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I get to have it changed out next Friday.

82
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And so that it's not like completely gross and disgusting.

83
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
But no DDR for a little bit for you.

84
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
But I've learned to hobble around in it.

85
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So, and I told Dan, if he pisses me off too hard, I'm going to kick him so far up the ass with this boot that he's going to be spitting up fiberglass.

86
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
What a, what a great mental image.

87
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
That is true love.

88
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
All right.

89
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Let's say hello to, we can't continue to ignore.

90
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Of course, the one and only tech master, Loki, also here in studio.

91
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Hello.

92
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Hi, how are you, Loki?

93
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Fine.

94
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Did you have a good week off?

95
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I know you didn't travel like Jamie and I did, but.

96
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I tried finding stuff to do that day, but it just wasn't, nothing was lining up.

97
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
There's nothing good playing in the theater and the times just didn't line up.

98
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Yeah.

99
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Like the movies, like they were like is either transformers, which is or like Wonder Woman, which has been fine, but they're both like two and a half hours long.

100
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And it's like, it was just, I can't fit that in there.

101
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So I wandered around aimlessly.

102
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I tried to work on my, my programming stuff at like a Barnes and Noble, but it just wasn't happening.

103
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It wasn't happening because I was unable to plug in my laptop.

104
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And if I don't plug in this laptop, the battery just goes down super fast and it also throttles the CPU.

105
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So it just, it was not having it.

106
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Um, and then I thought about you though, because there was some game jam I was reading about the week we were gone.

107
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I forget, I forget which game jam it was, but it was about basically making clicker games.

108
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Yeah.

109
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Yeah.

110
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Did you participate?

111
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Cause I knew you were thinking about it, right?

112
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It's not, it's, it's more casual.

113
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's through the entire month of July.

114
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Oh, okay.

115
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
And so yeah, it's like, like click, click, clicker, clicker jam or something like that.

116
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Yeah.

117
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It's, it's basically.

118
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Not that we should ever be encouraging you to work on yet another project you won't finish.

119
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
However, I was like, all right, well if there's anything to divert his attention, a clicker game would be, would be it.

120
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I mean, so like I, I do want to participate.

121
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I am hesitant to see how much I did sign up.

122
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm hesitant to see how much, um, if I can get anything done.

123
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Um, because like if this weekend's any indicator, it's probably not very likely just, it's way too crazy.

124
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And just at the end of the day, it's like, fuck this.

125
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I have no brain power, but no, I've actually been thinking about it.

126
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Like I had to, I had an initial idea that was more along the lines of it's time to car where it's fucking crazy and weird.

127
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And then I kind of was looking for music to go along with that.

128
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Couldn't find any ran across something else, which totally threw it in a completely different direction.

129
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
That's not so goofy, weird.

130
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's just, you know, kind of cool stylistic, I guess.

131
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:12,000
But I, you know, at one point I was, you know, anticipating that there was going to be, you know, fart noises with clicks and stuff like that.

132
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So how mature I just haven't, you know, I, I don't know, maybe some, but no, I haven't,

133
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I haven't completely different direction with it.

134
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:29,000
So I'm still in the designing idea phase right now because I want to make sure I know what I'm making before I make it.

135
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
But I do want to make something.

136
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Well, good luck.

137
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I hope you, I hope you finish one so we can actually play it.

138
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
We'll see.

139
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I do want to give a big thank you.

140
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
My own birthday was, not everybody knows this, my own birthday was three days after OLR,

141
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,000
which is the whole reason why Alan and I went to Chicago in the first place was it was supposed to be a birthday trip.

142
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
But Loki just tonight surprised me with a little birthday gift here.

143
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And this is actually a coloring book based on the Golden Girls.

144
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And I thought this was fantastic.

145
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It goes along with the gentle little jousting I sent you.

146
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Yes, yes, I got that on Steam as well.

147
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Thank you for that.

148
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I haven't had a chance to play that yet, but I did see that.

149
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And I was like, it's a bummer this game is banned from Twitch.

150
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I could play that on Twitch.

151
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'll take you up some color pencils then as my gift.

152
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Well, yeah.

153
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And then my thought is, is that maybe I could actually do a Twitch feed because art is big on Twitch right now.

154
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
So I'll actually do a Twitch feed where I color my Golden Girls coloring book,

155
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
because that's about the only way you're going to get art out of me.

156
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
But I'll do a creative stream.

157
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
This thing I just put my mouth has curry in it.

158
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Curry, dark chocolate truffle.

159
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm going to be in trouble halfway through the show.

160
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Did you bring your EpiPen in case? Are you all right?

161
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I haven't had anything that I'm allergic to.

162
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Oh, I thought the Spicer.

163
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I gave you guys the paprika one.

164
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Okay, yeah, yeah.

165
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So we're good.

166
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Oh my God.

167
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
All right. Enjoy, enjoy the chocolates.

168
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
We're going to get the play by play over there of the exotic chocolates from Chicago.

169
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
All right.

170
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Tiger Claw in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

171
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Which by the way, of course, if you are listening live,

172
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
we do tape live Sunday nights at the Voice Geeks Network of vognetwork.com.

173
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

174
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And you can participate along with comments such as what Tiger Claw is saying to me right now.

175
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Rob Roberts, eventually you need to do one of those IRL streams on Twitch.

176
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I almost did yesterday because they built, I guess, the capability to do IRL streams right into the mobile app.

177
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Like I guess that was a big update the Twitch thing got this week.

178
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Which if you're not following me on Twitch, cheap plug, Rob Roberts.

179
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,000
But you could also follow the Vognetwork account on Twitch and it hosts everything as they go live.

180
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
But what was I going to say with that?

181
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Oh yes, I went to round one randomly yesterday.

182
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So I thought, oh, this would be fun maybe to do an IRL stream of me around the arcade.

183
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
But my cell signal in there was not so great.

184
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Because it is in like the middle of an older mall that I think has thick walls.

185
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Excuse me, so I don't think my cell signal was very great in there.

186
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So that didn't happen. Sorry.

187
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Maybe next time I'll find a Wi-Fi to tether to and we can do that.

188
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
But I've given the IRL thing some thought.

189
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I kind of think I'm kind of boring though.

190
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,000
So I hope you guys have some good questions or ideas to make it more entertaining if I do do an IRL thing at some point.

191
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
So we'll see.

192
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Anyway, yeah, I know it's funny because Tigerclaw also points out Twitch's IRL is what Justin.tv used to be.

193
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Yeah, it's funny how these things come full circle, isn't it?

194
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Totally is. Remember when OLR was on Justin.tv?

195
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Perhaps if they had marathon Pokemon, you know, Sesame, or what was it?

196
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Mr. Rogers, Bob Ross.

197
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Bob Ross, they wouldn't have gone under.

198
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Found that secret sauce a long time ago, right?

199
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Alright.

200
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Anyway, let's see.

201
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Going to chat over at live.fognetwork.com.

202
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Raginator says, genital jousting and a Golden Girls coloring book.

203
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Definitely has Rob Roberts' name written all over it.

204
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Now all he's missing is a personal visit from ABBA, the original cast of Rocky Horror Picture Show, and Cher.

205
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I've met two of the, well, three of the original cast of the movie, Rocky Horror.

206
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I don't know if I'll ever get a chance to be sure.

207
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
And plenty of them were in the stage production.

208
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Yes, two of the three were in the stage production.

209
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Let's see, a personal visit from ABBA.

210
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I would die.

211
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You can't even get ABBA all in one space anymore.

212
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:13,000
The last time ABBA all was in one space, there was the movie premiere of Mamma Mia, but there was one time after that.

213
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Not that long ago.

214
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Can you disguise yourself as a child with cancer?

215
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Because we can maybe work that.

216
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Okay, there's some things that you don't joke about, and I think that's one of them.

217
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
So, there's certain lengths I'm not going to go to.

218
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Let's see, and yeah, so, but we could do an IRL stream when I go to Rocky Horror sometime.

219
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I don't know if that would be appropriate for Twitch, but I guess there's one way to find out.

220
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
All right, anyway, all that stuff aside, we need to talk about video games.

221
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I want to get into tonight's kickoff topic.

222
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:48,000
So, tonight's kickoff topic has to do with a game that was recently pulled from the PlayStation Network and the PlayStation Store.

223
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I don't know if there's anything you want to say about this, Loki, because you're the one that brought this story to my attention,

224
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:01,000
but I guess there was a game on the store called Star Star Star, like five star, 1000 top rated was the name of the game.

225
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
As if that doesn't sound like one of those, like, trash games on Google Play or Apple Store.

226
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Ironically enough, because I do, you know, cheap plug, I've watched, you know, Jim Sterling religiously,

227
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
and he was the one that kind of brought this to attention.

228
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,000
He had a whole segment about, you know, a bit about it, and yeah, there's a lot of these guys,

229
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:30,000
and this is, I think, one of them that are kind of some of the ones that make the dynamic themes that are out there.

230
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
There's a bunch of them, they're ridiculous.

231
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
And I think all those ridiculous themes like, you know.

232
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Like anime girl themes and stuff like that.

233
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Lady with cleavage.

234
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I'm pretty sure, I think just based off the screenshots I've seen, I think this is the same one,

235
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
but there are some other ones that they released that was like, you know, big titty anime babes,

236
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
but like with this really shitty Arkanoid game that was over it and stuff.

237
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,000
And actually, this one is even worse, it's a slide puzzle game, and they have like, okay,

238
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
the guy on the website is like, yeah, you get a platinum trophy in 20 minutes,

239
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
there's a walkthrough on how to do it and stuff like that.

240
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Just like being completely blatant about it,

241
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
and just wanting, you know, people to purchase the game to get a platinum trophy.

242
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Like, like anyone would give a shit that you have a platinum trophy for star star star, you know, 1000 top rated.

243
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It's ridiculous, but it's kind of this garbage that was from, you know, that you would see it like on Steam,

244
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Greenlight almost, that's just-

245
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Well, there's actually a trailer that's linked here, and I don't know, oh my, oh, it's a minute long trailer here.

246
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,000
So, it's just 1000 4K images, and it's slide puzzles.

247
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
So, something that somebody would make in a second.

248
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
And they're showing that you get all these trophies.

249
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Oh, they're just advertising how easy it is to get all these trophies, including a platinum trophy as a part of that.

250
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
So, and this is a 98 cent game, and that's it, it's tile puzzles that are super easy to complete,

251
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
and you end up basically getting a platinum trophy as essentially a freebie, let's just call it that,

252
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
out of the game that you paid 98 cents for.

253
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Sony has apparently pulled the game, and asked the developer to rename it and remove any mention of the trophies.

254
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Oh, so they're gonna remove the advertisement for it, but they're gonna leave the game up there, it sounds like.

255
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Just rename the-

256
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Sony gets a percentage of those profits too, so.

257
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
That's pretty fucking lame.

258
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Okay, so it brings me to this question, this is the question I pose to all of you in our chat over at live.fognetwork.com,

259
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:32,000
as well as those of you in studio here is, so clearly this is essentially, let's call it what it is,

260
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
pay a dollar, get a platinum trophy.

261
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Yeah.

262
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Is that something you're willing to do? How important are trophies to you?

263
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
No, it's not, it's not worth this crap being cluttered up in my-

264
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It's like, it's not even earning it, it was just like garbage, why, who would even care?

265
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Is it like, what's that give you? Nothing. I mean, what, do you rank or something? Like, what do either of the ranks do?

266
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I'm like, nothing, I only pay attention to that.

267
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,000
On Sony they don't really do anything, in fact the only place I've really seen it tied to anything is on Steam,

268
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
as you level up on Steam, but that's not, that's not based on achievements, so that's based on trading cards.

269
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Seriously, like, watching through, um, like, some of these videos that Jim Sterling has,

270
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:21,000
not even necessarily just this game, there's other games, there's a lot of shit that's slipping through under the radar with Sony,

271
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
like broken ass games that are appearing on their storefront.

272
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It's like, where's the fucking oversight for this stuff? This is, it's gonna get as bad as it was on Steam,

273
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I mean, it's already pretty bad because, you know, all those games that were sitting there in, you know, Greenlight Limbo there,

274
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,000
they approved all of them before they shut that service down, so it's a big fucking flood of thousands of games.

275
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Okay, but let me, let me ask this, is this to say, now let's take this whole dollar for a platinum trophy thing out of the equation.

276
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Are trophies in general or achievements in that whole thing, do they mean anything to you?

277
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Because I feel like a lot of people read Nintendo, and I've been guilty of this too,

278
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Nintendo gets read a lot because they've ignored this whole trend.

279
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:12,000
They don't have achievements and trophies in their games unless sometimes, like Smash Brothers kind of has its own little meta system,

280
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
but there's nothing that overarches the entire system, is what I mean.

281
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
And Nintendo kind of gets crap for that sometimes.

282
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I mean, there's games that I'll keep playing that try to get all the trophies in them, like Skyrim is one,

283
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:34,000
where I may just quit otherwise, I mean, it's good like kind of goals, like to get to a certain, you know, do certain things to kind of see the full expanse of the game.

284
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Granted, developers can use it for really shitty purposes, and like, not only just this where it's super easy,

285
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,000
there's a ton of games that like, for example on Steam, where loading up the game gives you, you know, a trophy,

286
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
every bullet you fire gives you a fucking trophy, like ridiculous shit like that.

287
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:58,000
And it's just to kind of boost your levels up on their service, so it's, I don't know, it's just about using it in the right way.

288
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I just, I feel like we are, we have come so close to the edge of a really good idea, and Sony was kind of close to this,

289
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I think the closest idea that I always thought kind of like would benefit Nintendo very well, was when Sony had PlayStation Home, remember that?

290
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:20,000
And when you got trophies in certain games, you would unlock virtual loot in PlayStation Home,

291
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
either it was a shirt, or it was like an actual trophy for your house or whatever, in the PlayStation Home.

292
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Yeah, you're supposed to have a trophy group that never came.

293
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Right, that whole thing, right? So, I mean, you know, which, for the people that were super into PlayStation Home,

294
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
which I remember a few years ago on this show, we had some listeners that were like super into PlayStation Home,

295
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
we had an awesome little VOG clubhouse and all this stuff, and you know, a lot of it was rewards from games.

296
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Well, okay, the reason why I bring that up and say that in the same breath as Nintendo is that Nintendo has Miitomo, right?

297
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:54,000
So, and even some of this is with Tomodachi life, right? So they've had this idea of customize your outfits on your Mi,

298
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,000
have your room with your posters and all this, so I always kind of thought Nintendo was missing out on,

299
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:07,000
oh, well, what if there was like a Miitomo type thing on Switch where you could have your virtual rewards that showed,

300
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:17,000
hey, I beat, you know, Zelda Breath of the Wild, or even some day they have a virtual console thing and I beat Super Metroid,

301
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:23,000
or yes, Bobby Black Wolf, I beat Chrono Trigger, and I could have those little things on the wall,

302
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
like posters and shirts and things, and I could show that to my friends.

303
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Oh, God, what's the punchline? What's the punchline, Bobby?

304
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
We already have it, except they're doing exactly what this company's doing.

305
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
You're paying for those trophies. They're called amiibos.

306
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
You get your fucking trophy and you can re-team it in other games and you get your little skin saying,

307
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
hey, look at me, I'm super awesome because I bought the Link amiibo.

308
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:51,000
That's what it is. I mean, it's this fucking thing, except in actually having to earn it, you go to the store,

309
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
you earn that money at your day job, you go to the store, you buy your little trophy,

310
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
and then you share that trophy in game because they got to justify the cost of that trophy.

311
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
You didn't do anything besides fight people in a line at GameStop to get that amiibo.

312
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
That was the achievement.

313
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Well, nowadays with Nintendo's stock, you know, maybe that is an achievement.

314
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I just think it would be-

315
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
You got an SNES mini. The whole system should be a goddamn amiibo, okay?

316
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
You should be able to put the whole system onto stuff and have SNES stuff.

317
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I just think it would be great if you could unlock these types of things and then it's like your badge of honor.

318
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:33,000
But like, you know, if I have a poster or a reward I got from 5-star 1000 top rated, that wouldn't mean anything.

319
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Like, I would have friends that would see that and go, what the hell's that game? Well, whatever.

320
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Oh, Chrono Trigger.

321
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Why'd you waste some money on that?

322
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
No, why'd you waste money on that? Anyway, look at these.

323
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
And I just think that would be so cool.

324
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
You should do a livestream. Let it go really long. Just play that shitty ass game.

325
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
There's other good games that could be playing on the line.

326
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Okay, let me ask you. Dark Sakura, you have been a long time gamer through many classic games and so forth.

327
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
What's your stance on, in general, achievements and trophies?

328
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Do they mean anything to you? Do you use them as goals like Loki or what?

329
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Eh.

330
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Eh?

331
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Don't give a crap.

332
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Big mess that you don't really care about.

333
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I really don't care. I like achievements that are tangible.

334
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:16,000
That, you know, like, if I got an achievement in a game and suddenly it gave me one of these delicious chocolates.

335
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
That would be worthwhile. That would feel like a fucking reward.

336
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Or it's like, you've got the highest score in this game. You get a pedicure.

337
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Okay, that would be tangible. That would be something that-

338
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
You want real life rewards for things.

339
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
That would be something that adds value to my life.

340
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Yeah, that would be great.

341
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,000
You know, unlike where I get an award at work and I get, like, points to get work swag or something.

342
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Or, you know, kudos that make me hirable for another position.

343
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:53,000
A kudo in a game is like, okay, I did a thing that I was going to do anyway. I don't care.

344
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
The only time that I've ever been kind of antsy on doing one is one that-

345
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Actually, there is a game I was interested in achievements in for a while and that was WoW.

346
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah. World of Warcraft. Sure.

347
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Because I would- Eventually, for some of them, I'd get something from it.

348
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Like a mount.

349
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Like a mount.

350
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Okay.

351
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
You know, that dumb little pug dog.

352
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
For putting up with other people.

353
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
We need something like, maybe there could be a mobile phone app that would generate QR codes you could take to the store.

354
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
So, like, for example, you just beat Dead or Alive Xtreme Volleyball 2.

355
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Take this barcode to Rite Aid for a tub of KY and a pack of socks.

356
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Well-

357
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
There's little socks there?

358
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Yes.

359
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Yes, they do, actually.

360
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:47,000
But still, I would like a tangible reward for it. Something that enriches my life apart from just ego-fapping.

361
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Okay. I think that's a great idea, though, is that, like, you could actually get, like, little rewards.

362
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Why not? There was that Foursquare or Swarm or whatever it is you could check into Chili's and you get free chips and salsa.

363
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Doesn't Facebook kind of have stuff like this, too?

364
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Go on.

365
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
It used to be this way. I don't think they still do.

366
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Well, there was a thing with Dan's work that if, like, this was at, um, crap, what was it? At, um, Outback.

367
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:22,000
That if, like, their driver in NASCAR won a race, then you got, like, a free Bloomin' Onion or something.

368
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Oh, yeah, they do that with the Kings here locally. When the Kings actually win a game, you get, like, a free taco at Jack in the Box.

369
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
It's win-win. There's no way it's ever gonna happen.

370
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Exactly, and it's, like, they never have to give away tacos. No, no, it's tacos are for the Sharks.

371
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:45,000
When they score a goal in the last two minutes of the second quarter, or second period, you get tacos from Jack in the Box. I remember that's a thing.

372
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
The Carl's Jr. was for the Kings.

373
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Why would they punish their fans like that?

374
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Some people, you should, you should have been there when they fuckin' scored a goal and everybody got a fuckin' taco.

375
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Sweet, crabby tacos!

376
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Well, at any rate...

377
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
You know, there's no cost hardly anything.

378
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I think it's, it's the NASCAR one is a bit better, because that has a lower chance, because, what, it's 18 drivers? 20-something drivers?

379
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Yeah, yeah.

380
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:13,000
And then, um, to have their sponsored car win, that many Bloomin' Onions for people who'd go in, you know?

381
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Yeah.

382
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
But, at any rate, that's besides the point. You know, I like...

383
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
We wonder why we have an obesity problem in America.

384
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I like a reward that enriches my life, instead of ego-fapping, which is gonna be my official term for it now. Ego-fapping.

385
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Uh, isn't there a guy called that on YouTube?

386
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I don't care.

387
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Alright, anyway, moving on. Uh, Bobby Blackwell says, that barcode, talking about my, my trip to Rite Aid, that barcode gets copied on the internet and then they run out of socks.

388
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:47,000
No, it would be, it would be a unique code. Like, what? They can generate codes for, uh, unlockable items in Final Fantasy XIV by going to store, or any pre-order bonus you open in a manual.

389
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Top Noodle?

390
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Just unique codes. Would that, would that be so difficult?

391
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
It should be like a single-use coupon.

392
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Yeah. And then, like...

393
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
And once the coupon's redeemed, it's no longer valid.

394
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Yeah, I don't know. Anyway, uh, so, uh, Dungeon Buster goes on to say in our chat, uh, as much crap as Ubisoft's Uplay gets, uh, I like what it does with its achievement points by turning it into currency you can use to get DLC extra.

395
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I do like that.

396
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I have to, yeah, I do like that too. Like, you can get...

397
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
See, that's...

398
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
...remixes in Just Dance.

399
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
A reward.

400
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Yeah. Okay.

401
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
That's a reward.

402
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:28,000
So, let's go back to the Nintendo thing for a minute, because they kinda, like, have half of this already right in Miitomo. You do, you get, you answer enough questions, you do whatever, you get the coins...

403
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Yeah.

404
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
...that you can then buy special outfits.

405
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
And still playing Miitomo.

406
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Right. But can't Nintendo put this idea in other stuff too? I mean, Mario Run had it, right? You get the trophies in your little town. So, I mean, virtual rewards then. All the socks, because they're digital socks.

407
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:55,000
So, like, looking, and this is actually fresh on my mind because of Steam. Like, I know that now Steam is giving you these stupid stamps that are, like, you get a discount on a game that you don't give a shit about.

408
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
The stamps get you discounts? I thought the stamps were, like, literally...

409
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
No.

410
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I don't know. I get stuff sent to my, you know, there's, like, a whole bunch of crap cluttering my inventory with all these discounts.

411
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I've gotten some crazy discounts for some stuff, and only, like, I've only ever used the discount, like, once.

412
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Hmm.

413
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Even though I, now, I did only buy two things in the Steam sale, but I'm going to go into that in my gaming week.

414
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I did like the article they read where people are using this, of course, true fashion. People are using the stickers to make erotic scenes in their little...

415
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Because of course. Because internet. Because of course.

416
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
It's the internet. Of course you're going to do that.

417
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Because of course.

418
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Let's see. Vidpower in chat says, somebody put ego fapping on Urban Dictionary's stat.

419
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
But that's followed up with, Raginator says, put in Chivo fapping if it ain't already there.

420
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
And Eric RPG says, trophy stroking.

421
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Great. Look what we've started here at OLR.

422
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Anyway.

423
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I was just kind of curious what you all felt about this.

424
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,000
You know, because achievements were brand new ten years ago on the Xbox 360, or twelve, whatever, on the Xbox 360.

425
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
And now it's, like, we've been, that's a part of our gaming world now ten years later.

426
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
People expect it.

427
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Yeah.

428
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
And people would, you know, try to run after those, you know, especially with achievement points because they gave you a score.

429
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Trophies I don't think so much because now it's more of, like, a level in the number of platinums you have.

430
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:18,000
So that's not so much, but, like, I know, like, with achievement points it's like, ooh, I can get, like, a thousand achievement points in that game.

431
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Or, you know, oh, they upped it to twelve fifty now.

432
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Well, even Microsoft themselves. Remember when Rare Replay was first advertised?

433
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Even Microsoft themselves was, like, over thirty thousand achievement points available.

434
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Or some, I don't remember what the exact number was because some of the games being arcade hits are, like, only two hundred.

435
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
But you know what I mean. Like, there was, like, a pretty good number of achievement points available in that game.

436
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
And that was a selling point when they showed that original trailer at that E3.

437
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Why not mention it? I mean, who cares? I mean.

438
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Some people love that stuff.

439
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Some people need their ego fapped.

440
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
That's right.

441
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:55,000
But even, you know what? I enjoy the occasional ego fap because, like, for example, games that I play a lot of.

442
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Ingress and Pokemon Go, right? The AR games.

443
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I like that there's a little fake badge collection in Ingress and I like collecting those.

444
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Like, that's a lot of fun. And some of them, yeah, I've paid real money for badges.

445
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
But for me, they're a symbol of I participated in this event.

446
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I went to Chicago. I played in this anomaly.

447
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
It's your participation.

448
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
It's my participation trophy. Yay! Millennials.

449
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Or what's the term for us? Zennials. We're Gen X, but we feel close to Millennials.

450
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Which I still feel my ear should have been included with that.

451
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:30,000
But the category was, like, if you were alive when, or if you were, like, an infant when Star Wars came out.

452
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Yeah.

453
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
And I was an infant.

454
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Which I was. So.

455
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Now, you weren't born when Star Wars came out.

456
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Oh, no, you're right. You're right. I was, I'm thinking the later films in the trilogy.

457
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Anyway.

458
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
The generation talk is for another episode. A lot of that is silly.

459
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I almost bought a cane so I could shake it at people.

460
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Anyway, what else was I going to say in chat? Over at live.foggenetwork.com

461
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Let's see, Dungeon Buster points out Nier Automata allows you to buy all of the achievements except one at one point in the game.

462
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Oh, I remember that discussion that had come up on a previous episode.

463
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
That's very true. Very true.

464
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Oh, with Ingress and Pokemon Go. So, the Ingress has the fake badges.

465
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Pokemon Go now with this new redo of, I'm sorry, I'm spoiling a little bit of what we're going to get into in a little bit in the news.

466
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
But now you can collect gym badges. Right?

467
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,000
So, when you go to a gym and you spin a gym for the first time, you get a badge in your profile that shows you've been to that gym.

468
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,000
And you can level up that badge as you're doing, you know, the fights at the gyms and all this stuff.

469
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
So, this is all part of the makeover that, Loki, I know you'll get into later.

470
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
And then you can link those badges together to create a field.

471
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
That's the wrong game, Loki.

472
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:44,000
But anyway, so for the badges in Pokemon Go, now it's kind of like, I like collecting them on my profile.

473
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Because that whole thing went live when I was in Chicago.

474
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
So, like, everybody knows the fucking bean in Chicago, right?

475
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
The big metallic, they call it Cloud Gate. I think it's the official name of that thing.

476
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
But it's at Millennial Park, right?

477
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
So, that was like one of the first gym badges I got was the bean.

478
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
And so, I think that's kind of cool that that's in my profile.

479
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,000
And that's very similar to Ingress. When you do missions, you can get a little sticker that showed like,

480
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
oh, you did a mission in Washington, D.C. at the Smithsonian or something like that.

481
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
So, now I've kind of made it this thing where like I really want to collect gym badges.

482
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
And I was out playing Pokemon Go with one of my pals today who doesn't play a lot of video games,

483
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
but does play Pokemon Go.

484
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
And now we've kind of turned it into this like ego war between us.

485
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
They're like, he's like, well, I have 79 gym badges. How many do you have?

486
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,000
And I'm like, I have 48, but I'm going to be working on kicking your ass because I know where to go

487
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
thanks to the other game to find all the gyms.

488
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:42,000
So, now that's becoming like a little, what is it? Ego fapping? Ego fap? Ego fapter thing between us.

489
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
So, there you go. Anything else you want to say?

490
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I'm just, Dark Soccer is too busy eating chocolate.

491
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Oh, my God.

492
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Hoping for a partnership.

493
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Okay, get this one. The one I'm eating now has macadamia nuts, Sri Lankan coconut, 45% cacao dark milk chocolate.

494
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
It tastes like...

495
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Snobs.

496
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
It tastes like hipster.

497
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
And it's delicious. All right.

498
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Let's talk a little bit about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week

499
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
since I'm starting to get into it anyway with this Pokemon Go chat.

500
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
But Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?

501
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I played Pokemon Go.

502
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I've been playing Miitomo.

503
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I'm playing Sailor Moon Drops and Dragon Ball Doken, whatever that card game is.

504
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
But now, I've really been getting into Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2.

505
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I know I'm a little late to the game, but the Steam sale put it for like almost half price.

506
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
So, I got like the full DLC and everything.

507
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
And I'm really enjoying it. I'm enjoying it far more than I thought I would.

508
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I thought that I was just going to have a happy nerd moment, play it for like a little bit and be done.

509
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Oh no.

510
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:01,000
The game is like 90% button mashing, fighting in space and fan service.

511
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
And the other part of it is incoherent screaming, which is Dragon Ball in a nutshell.

512
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
And I love every moment I'm playing it in Japanese.

513
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Do you scream back?

514
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
No. Well, my character does.

515
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
My character does.

516
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:22,000
And I've been going around and there's NPCs in the game and some of their names are puns and it's fun.

517
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:31,000
And it's just like so much old school fan service that I've gotten this crazy nostalgic feeling and it's been so happy and I've really enjoyed it.

518
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
And the only thing is that there's certain things that aren't translated and I'm only understanding half of it.

519
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:42,000
So I've been going and actually using it to take a moment to study.

520
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
So it's been really helpful that way.

521
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
And I played a little WoW, not like a whole lot, because honestly, I'm kind of bored with Legion right now.

522
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Even though like they've done the...

523
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I started the LFR for the Sargeras Tomb, which is pretty good.

524
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I mean, I'd like to... I'm going to try to level up again.

525
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I think I'm like at item level 894 right now.

526
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
So pretty up there.

527
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
But no one ever plays.

528
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:21,000
And then I also went to Shane's and played the Danganronpa V3 demo, which is really great.

529
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I mean, some of the stuff was funny and I was making fake translations.

530
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I would translate the stuff that I could tell what they were saying for real.

531
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
But two of the characters from one of the other games...

532
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Makoto from the first game shows up and then Hinata from the second game shows up.

533
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
And they're with you to be your senpai in game.

534
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
That's what they quite literally said.

535
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
But I'm still translating like, I still don't know what I'm doing in this game.

536
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
This is apparently a sequel, blah, blah, blah.

537
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
And it was really fun.

538
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,000
And I like the new thought drive, I think it was called, or logic drive.

539
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
I have to look it up again.

540
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:13,000
But it's basically where you're playing Outrun in a really like hyper neon 80s car with all the background and everything.

541
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
But you have to run through different letters to form your idea and then you have to answer questions.

542
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
It's really fun.

543
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I suggest for fans of the series, get the demo, try it out.

544
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,000
You'd have to read a little bit to know what the answers are, but don't worry about it.

545
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
It's just super fun.

546
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
And the voice acting is great.

547
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
And I recognize a few of the voice actors too.

548
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
But I'm really excited then for Danganronpa V3 to come out.

549
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I picked up also the Steam sale.

550
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Ultra Despair Girls came out and it wasn't on sale, but I bought it anyway.

551
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Even though I already have the Vita version for my PlayStation TV.

552
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:57,000
But I figured it'd be easier to play on my computer where I can use the mouse for choosing the bullets to use and everything.

553
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
So, yay for another game.

554
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I'm not going to get to play for a while, but that's my gaming week.

555
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Alright, we will move on then to Loki.

556
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
How was your gaming week?

557
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I wish I played more, but I didn't.

558
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I watched a lot of YouTube this week because I'm just like that I guess.

559
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:21,000
But I did want to mention though, speaking of YouTube, and I did try to work on games this week.

560
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I'm mostly just thinking about them.

561
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:34,000
But one long time guy that was on our show has come back to start doing YouTube videos again.

562
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:40,000
So, Maximilian Moreau with PushyPixels is back and he's started doing more videos again.

563
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Cooking with Unity?

564
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Cooking with Unity, yes, absolutely.

565
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
So, he started working on a Space Invaders clone.

566
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
And he's been doing that.

567
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,000
So, yeah, definitely go support him because I know he's had a lot of real life issues that have kind of put him off for a while.

568
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
So, he's finally made it back, which I think is fantastic.

569
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
So, definitely fun to check that out.

570
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,000
But actual games I've been playing, all sadly mobile games, because that's...

571
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
That's where things are going these days.

572
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:13,000
And I joked, you know, when I was talking about the clicker thing on Twitter, the whole jam.

573
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I'm like, yeah, if I can pull myself away from the clicker games that I'm playing now, and that's what I'm playing, including right now.

574
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I'm playing the stupid office space clicker game.

575
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
And the reason why I think it's so...

576
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Well, it's a lot of strategy involved with it because they do these little events that you basically can earn some of the stuff that you would normally pay in-game money for.

577
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,000
So, like the different card packs to boost your floor values and stuff.

578
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
So, you can actually earn.

579
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Is that after your gaming week?

580
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
No. Pokemon Go. I'll go into more of that later because a lot of it would have to do with the raid stuff.

581
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
So, I actually did a raid against a Magikarp.

582
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
I was like, you may need five people for this. I'm like, I don't think I do.

583
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
And so, I was able to beat it with one Pokemon and it was stupid.

584
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
And then, sadly, that's it.

585
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Alright, I think Jamie wants to interrupt here with another chocolate.

586
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I interrupted this gaming week to say I'm eating the last of the chocolates.

587
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Oh my god, that's the last one already?

588
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I can't help it. They're so good.

589
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
There was only like nine of them, I think.

590
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Well, and I ate eight. This is literally number eight.

591
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Which one did you save for last?

592
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:29,000
This one is hazelnuts and 45% cacao dark milk chocolate because my favorite is hazelnut.

593
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
That sounds like a good standard to save for last.

594
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
So, I offer this tribute to myself. Thank you.

595
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Thank you for kiddie-sitting. Thank you for kiddie-sitting Sanrio while we were away.

596
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
My pleasure, but thank you for the chocolate.

597
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Alright, I hope it's good. I'm just waiting to see the reaction here.

598
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Alright, let me get into my gaming week.

599
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,000
So, because I was gone for a week, I didn't really play as many games as I probably should have.

600
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
I was hanging out with some gaming podcasters, you guys might remember, though.

601
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Delvin from Video Game Realness, which they've been doing shows sparingly here and there.

602
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
But we were hanging out a lot during the week.

603
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
And then my pals from the show Koopa Club, which they stopped about a year or so ago.

604
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
But I was getting to hang out with all of them in Chicago, so that was a lot of fun.

605
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:16,000
But as far as actual game playing, around the trip I've been playing Final Fantasy XIV Stormblood because of the expansion.

606
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I talked a little bit about that last week. A lot has, two weeks ago when we were doing our show,

607
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
a lot of that has stabilized, thank heavens, since the launch of the game.

608
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
They're not having a lot of the network issues they were having previously.

609
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Some sparingly on the more crowded servers, but I'm not on one of the crowded servers, so I'm not really having a lot of the issues.

610
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,000
But I'm kind of just taking my sweet ass time through the content, because everybody else kind of raced to 70.

611
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,000
So, I wasn't going to win that race, so I'm trying to treat it a little more as a marathon than a sprint.

612
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,000
So, I'm like level 67, but the content I'm doing is like only level 64.

613
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
For those that have been playing, I'm in Yanxia, I just got there to that zone.

614
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
So I've been kind of playing around with that a little bit.

615
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Outside of MMOs, I've been playing just a little bit of other stuff.

616
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
When I was on the plane, you want to talk about random?

617
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
For whatever reason, I had my 3DS and I was going through my NES classics.

618
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I started playing Zelda II, The Adventure of Link.

619
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
You know, that Zelda NES game, the one that a lot of people really don't like because it's too hard.

620
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
I just wanted to be like, how far can I remember this game?

621
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
So that way, if the plane were to go down, you'd be like, at least I can stop playing this fucking game.

622
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Something like that.

623
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
No, I actually played through the first palace.

624
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
I found the second palace and I think that's finally when I was like, you know what, I'm going to go watch more Riverdale.

625
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
But I was pretty impressed with how much I actually remembered.

626
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:44,000
But god, those palaces, especially when you get to the second palace, I'm like, oh my god, there's so many more hallways and all this stuff than I remember.

627
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I need a Nintendo Power that has the picture of what it looks like because I'm pretty sure I used those back in the day to actually beat that stinking game.

628
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
It's hard when it's all in your head and you're trying to remember.

629
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Or I have a system that's like, I always go as far down and as far to the left.

630
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:06,000
It's kind of like that hole to solve a maze, always make left turns and eventually you'll find the exit, something like that.

631
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:15,000
So I was trying to do something like that with Zelda and it was, you know, it's just, god, that second palace is gigantic.

632
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
So I got stuck a little bit on that and finally I was like, I'm going to go watch more TV.

633
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Other than that, I took a random trip to round one yesterday.

634
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:30,000
So I saw our pals from Game Buoy here at VOG Network. I met up with them at round one.

635
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:37,000
And you know when we go to round one, we play lots of Japanese music games, including, I played the crap out of Theatrhythm.

636
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:45,000
And still loving that. I played some Sound Voltex as well, some BeatMania 2DX, Cinnabuzz, I keep wanting to say Cinnabon.

637
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,000
But yeah, I was playing some of those games. So yeah, I got some arcade time in.

638
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,000
But as far as like other console stuff, I admittedly have not played a lot. I have not got sucked into the Steam sale.

639
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I kind of, again, me being out of town, I kind of missed most of that.

640
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I've been eyeing some things, but when's the last day? Is it the last day tomorrow or is it the last day of the fifth?

641
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I think it might be the fifth, but like I've been looking at stuff. I think I may have, I can't remember, I did purchase, aside from Genital Jousting, I purchased...

642
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Thank you for that gift, thank you.

643
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:23,000
It's gonna be funny. I purchased, I think I got the, what was it, the, that Lord of the Rings game.

644
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
God, I can't remember what it's called.

645
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Lord of the Fallen?

646
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:33,000
No, the one that's like Arkham, but it's, what the fuck is it called? I can't remember.

647
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
But it's the big Lord of the Rings game, they have a sequel coming out, they showed it at E3 this year.

648
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
But it was down to like three dollars and something for the game of the year.

649
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Shadow of Mordor.

650
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I can't remember the name. But yeah, Shadow of Mordor was down to like three or four bucks, so, for the game of the year edition, so I was like, yep, I'll jump on that.

651
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:00,000
I don't think I really purchased much else, just because, I don't know, I didn't know what I wanted, really.

652
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:06,000
I was like, I have a powerful, I have a PC that can run all this stuff now, which should I play? I don't know.

653
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Ragenator in chat is confirming that the fifth is the last day for the sale, and I know he knows his stuff when it comes to Steam sales, so there you go.

654
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
So I have a little time left to still get it on that, so that's good.

655
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
There are some things I'm eyeing, I'm looking at my wish list and trying to figure out what I might finally buy from that.

656
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:27,000
By the way, if you don't necessarily want to get it on Steam, it's also four dollars on the PlayStation sale as well.

657
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Yeah, that's the other thing is that, like, Microsoft's having a big sale, PlayStation's having a big sale.

658
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:39,000
I just picked up on PlayStation, like, they had the classic Pac-Man, Galaga, Dig Dug, and you know I'm a sucker for classic games.

659
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
And there was only like four, not even four bucks, like three fifty for like all three of those games.

660
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:50,000
So I was like, eh, what the hell, which is, you know, what they're banking on people to do, but, you know, I picked those up easy.

661
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:59,000
So, it is interesting how other companies are matching the Steam sale, basically, trying to get a little bit of that Steam, and what's going on over there.

662
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:06,000
So, but I probably, I'm eyeing a few things on Steam, I'll probably get suckered into buying before the sale is over, so there's that.

663
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:13,000
So, let's see. Bobby Blackwell says, Oculus also had their sale, but it ended yesterday.

664
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:19,000
SDG100Matt points out Amazon Prime Day is the eleventh, so keep that in mind. We'll get this.

665
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:30,000
So, one of my monitors that I use to play games, my monitor on the right side is dying, like it flickers really bad now when I turn it on, like it'll stabilize after thirty minutes.

666
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
It's doing exactly what the studio monitor does, it's like, it's just getting old.

667
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:41,000
So, I'm like, maybe this is a sign it's finally time for Rob to go to 4K, so, let's see if they have any good deals on Amazon Prime Day.

668
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Honestly, I don't know about 4K, it seems like people are going over 4K, they're doing the higher frame rate monitors, like G-Sync monitors and stuff like that, because it seems more bang for the buck, but I don't know.

669
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Maybe. I haven't, I don't have a 4K display, so I can't.

670
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Yeah, I don't know, it's kind of sold on Microsoft's thing that 4K gaming is where it's at. I don't know.

671
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:16,000
So, that's something I should get for my PC. I know I'm going to need another graphics card too, but you guys hear how much PC games I play, and I use a lot on PC to stream, so, you know, why not?

672
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:27,000
I think that's the direction I want to move in. Tiger Claw suggests getting an ultra-wide monitor. I don't know, I don't know. Dungeon Buster says Newegg has a sale on right now. Yeah, I'm thinking about that.

673
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Speaking of streaming, I guess I can say this. So, guess what husband got me as a birthday present, sitting in the other room? A green screen.

674
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
That's so awesome.

675
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:50,000
I got a green screen from Husb to set up for when I'm doing streaming. So, honestly, my concern is, I'm like, this thing is too fucking big, it's not going to fit with both of us in the office, but he seems to think he knows a way to get it to work.

676
00:43:50,000 --> 00:44:03,000
So, yeah, pretty soon on my stream, I'll actually have, instead of being able to see Alan behind me as he's coming, I'll have the green screen, so I can put, you know, boobies or packages or whatever I want, or 8-bit games.

677
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Or more images of yourself.

678
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
The satellite of VoG, yes. Or, yes, more images of myself.

679
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Just keep marrying the same thing, just like the infinite tunnel.

680
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,000
I like that, I like that. Just do the tunnel stuff there, so. Alright.

681
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
So, yeah, that's something I've got to set up pretty soon there.

682
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Alright, that's it for my gaming week. Let's get into some housekeeping. I do have some housekeeping tonight. I have a little bit of it, actually.

683
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:41,000
So, first off, I want to give a shoutout to the Pokemon Go podcast, which is on iTunes, and I know there's a lot of people listening to them because there's a lot of people that are playing Pokemon Go, and with a name like Pokemon Go podcast, they're pretty easy to find.

684
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
It's Prime Real Estate right there.

685
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
It's Prime Real Estate. That's, when I ran into it.

686
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Video games show the show.

687
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,000
And there is, there was, I think there was a show on all games, and I think they're still going, called Video Games Show.

688
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
There was a show called Video Game News Radio, I think was the name of it.

689
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:04,000
And then there's Video Games Show, I think is still going? I must confess, I haven't checked in in a while, there's so many podcasts, but I know they hit 10 years.

690
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
I know they were one of the podcasts that crossed the 10 year mark.

691
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Somebody in chat will probably jump in there.

692
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Bobby Blackwell confirms it is still going. Well, congrats to them, because that means they've got to be on at least like year 12 or 13 themselves, so congrats for them.

693
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
But anyway, what was I going to say with all that?

694
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Oh yes, Pokemon Go podcast.

695
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:33,000
So, it was funny, I ran into, I know one of the guys, Charles, because he's always at Dragon Con, so I ran into him there at the podcasting track, and I actually remember talking to him there.

696
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:38,000
I was like, that's some prime real estate you got there with Pokemon Go podcast, and he's like, yeah, yeah.

697
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
So, because they've been, you know, they jumped on the opportunity to do it right away.

698
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Well anyway, he remembered us having that conversation, and they had an opening on the show this week, because one of their hosts was participating in Nerdtacular this weekend.

699
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:57,000
So, I was sitting in as a guest host, and I was really happy and honored to be there, so I hope you all check that out, it's episode 51 of the Pokemon Go podcast.

700
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:04,000
And yeah, I got to talk a lot about Ingress, because there wasn't as much familiarity with that game over there, since, you know, that that's something I've played for a while.

701
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:10,000
So, I got to kind of talk about how the games have kind of impacted each other and the differences, since they are both Niantic games, so it was fun.

702
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:16,000
It'll be interesting to see how much Pokemon Go plays a factor in what Ingress 2.0 becomes.

703
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:22,000
And that is, you know, I didn't really get to get into that enough, because obviously I didn't want to dominate the whole, it was their show, I'm just a guest.

704
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:33,000
But for me personally, that is a real fascinating element, is now what is Pokemon Go going to do to Ingress with the 2.0, there will be an Ingress 2.0, it is coming, it's not a secret.

705
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,000
And it's probably coming by the end of the year, so I'm very, very curious about that as a fan of both games.

706
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:46,000
So anyway, shout out to Pokemon Go podcast, check out episode 51, and if you enjoyed my presence on the show, be sure to let them know.

707
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Anyway, outside of that, something very exciting for VOG Network I want to mention is that this week, VOG Network, we have launched our official Discord, so we have a Discord for VOG Network.

708
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Now, I know it's very easy to set up a Discord, and I know many people have their own Discords, and that's fantastic.

709
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:09,000
In fact, I know some other shows on the network have their own Discords, that is awesome, this is not being set up to compete with any of that stuff in any way.

710
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:19,000
But we thought, you know, some of the stuff that we've given to networking as podcasts, maybe we could do for networking as gamers, networking as Twitch streamers, networking as podcast producers.

711
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:34,000
So, if you want to join in on our Discord, you can, it's very easy to get to, just go to vognetwork.com slash Discord, or when you're on the VOG Network, at vognetwork.com, you can just go to under participate, there's a link that says Discord, and you can join our Discord.

712
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:41,000
And if you don't know what Discord is, it's a chat app that you can use on both your mobile phone and on your desktop.

713
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:49,000
It's a lot like Slack, which I know is very popular, it's a lot like that, but Discord is catered a little more towards gamers and has voice chat in it.

714
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:56,000
So we thought, ooh, this would be a really great way for when we're live streaming to be able to invite some people that watch the streams to chat with us.

715
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
And in fact, this is exactly how it played out.

716
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:07,000
So I ended up pulling the curtain back on this a couple days early, and it was one of those do the crime now, ask for forgiveness from Bobby Blackwolf later,

717
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:16,000
because a situation came up on the live stream where Shane and I were playing Final Fantasy XIV, but we wanted to help somebody else who was watching, who was on our server.

718
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:26,000
One of the guys, I know he listens to this show, FreeKillZero, was watching and needed some help with Titan, so we were offering to help, but we're like, we need a place where we can all chat, so we can talk.

719
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:32,000
So here we go, we got VOG Network Discord, so we all went over there, and that's why we ended up kind of putting the lid on that early.

720
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:40,000
But the cool thing also with the VOG Network Discord is that now whenever a show goes live, you'll get a chat message.

721
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Whenever a new podcast gets posted, whether it's a gaming show or not, because we have lots of non-gaming shows that are awesome on the network,

722
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
like Hooked on Bond, Pod Culture, you know, we got a lot of great non-gaming shows on the network as well,

723
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,000
anytime a new podcast gets posted, you're going to get notified in the Discord about it.

724
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Anytime a new article or TV review gets posted, those are going to come very soon as well, so you'll be able to see that as well, all in our Discord server.

725
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:12,000
So by all means, check it out, and sign up, there's certainly no cost or anything like that, so come be a part of the community at vognetwork.com slash Discord,

726
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,000
and get the latest on when we will be doing new things and new projects.

727
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:22,000
The one thing I do want to stress with that, IRC is not changing at this time.

728
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Our chat during the show that we do at live.vognetwork.com, that's not changing, the IRC channel is not going away.

729
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:35,000
We see Discord more as a replacement of sorts for the forums, which are kind of dead, more than anything.

730
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:41,000
We're not going to delete the forums, but we're not oblivious to the fact that no one's really using them,

731
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
because we just live in an internet day and age now where things are a little more immediate,

732
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:49,000
so Discord's going to kind of be testing the waters for that.

733
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:55,000
But we still will be using live.vognetwork.com for you to chat along with the shows live on Sunday nights,

734
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,000
because with Discord you have to make an account, not everybody necessarily wants to do that,

735
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:06,000
but the nice thing about live.vognetwork.com, if you want to chat with the show, you go in there, you type in your name, done.

736
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
You can get in our chat room right there on the web applet, and that's a little easy,

737
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
and we don't want to get rid of that easeness anytime soon.

738
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
That's a lie. IRC may not be around forever.

739
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Once we find an acceptable alternative, we may explore replacing it, but at this time it's not going anywhere.

740
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:34,000
So, going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, they're suggesting the ultra-wide monitors in there,

741
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,000
and it's kind of going back and forth a little bit on the ultra-wide monitors and if that's good or not.

742
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Act F says they don't really work well with gaming, Tiger Claw says but there are games that support ultra-wide.

743
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:51,000
I don't know, if I was like maybe an artist or maybe for like an ultra-wide monitor at work would kick ass,

744
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,000
but yeah, for gaming, I don't know, maybe, maybe. What do you guys think about those ultra-wide monitors? Have you seen them?

745
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
It's like one monitor that's two in one.

746
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
I know they are.

747
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Yeah. Do you like them?

748
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
I haven't used one much, but they're nice.

749
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Yeah.

750
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
I like having my two monitors.

751
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
I was thinking about the two monitors, but I just talked about old school and new school.

752
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Maybe I'll have to change my way of thinking sometime, so.

753
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,000
If I had a desktop, I'd probably have all sorts of fancy shit like that, but I'm using a laptop,

754
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
but my laptop screen's 17-inch, so that's pretty big.

755
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
That's true.

756
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:29,000
It's not ultra-wide, and I have seen some ridiculous shit that Asus put out with, you know, their,

757
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:36,000
I think it was Asus where it was like a three monitor setup for a laptop, which is a little fucking weird,

758
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
but someone's gonna use it, I'm sure.

759
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Alright, so I got my plugs out there.

760
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,000
VOG Network Discord, Pokemon Go Podcast. Check them both out.

761
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:52,000
So now it's time for us to get into some gaming news, which, Loki, we keep talking about Pokemon Go.

762
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
I guess it's a good thing we have it here in the first slot of the show tonight, right, Loki?

763
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Yes, it is, so I can talk a little bit more about my gaming week.

764
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
So they made the big update to the Pokemon Go gyms,

765
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:07,000
so now instead of being able to stack that shit full of all sorts of Pokemon that are large CP and HP,

766
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,000
you can now only put six Pokemon in there, and they all have to be different, so that's good.

767
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,000
And then when you fight each one, they have like a little heart meter that goes down,

768
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,000
it basically kind of wears them out, and then as that goes down, their CP drops,

769
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:28,000
and eventually they get weaker and weaker, but you can also boost them if you are on the same team,

770
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
by feeding them berries and that type of stuff.

771
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:37,000
And then one of the things you do also, which is kind of nice, is all those Pokemon gyms are also now Poke Stops,

772
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:42,000
so you can actually spin them like you can a Poke Stop, which is pretty awesome.

773
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
And then...

774
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Oh, can I just say with that, because here's a tip, because I mentioned this earlier,

775
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,000
now I'm in a rivalry to collect those gym badges, so when you get a gym badge, they go in your profile,

776
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
and this is pretty cool, if you haven't seen this, go to your profile,

777
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:00,000
in Pokemon Go, tap on your face to see your profile, tap on the All for the badges,

778
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,000
and then in the lower left corner of the screen that shows all your badges,

779
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,000
well, for one, you can sort that screen so you can see, if you want to sort by Defender in the bottom right,

780
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,000
you can actually see where all the gyms are that you have Pokemon Defending right now, which is nice,

781
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:18,000
but in the lower left is a map icon, and it'll actually show a very rudimentary map of the United States,

782
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
but, I mean, unfortunately, it's not like Google Satellite or anything,

783
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:26,000
you don't see anything underneath it, but I'm hoping that in time, maybe there will be some type of basic layers under that,

784
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,000
but you can actually see where all the gyms are that you have badges for,

785
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,000
so for me, it's really cool, because I can see, like, I have eight gyms in Chicago,

786
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
just the badges, I'm not controlling them, I just happen to have the badges,

787
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
like, proof that I visited the Bean when I was in Chicago,

788
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
and I even have one at the Vegas airport when I was coming home,

789
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
so I just think that's really cool that you can actually get a map of all those places you've been to,

790
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
so it's a little feature not everybody's noticed.

791
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Yeah, it's kind of cool. One of the new things, though, is raids,

792
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:57,000
so what raids are are these multiplayer kind of PvE things,

793
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
where you fight a Pokemon that has a really high CP,

794
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
and you can do it up to teams up to 20,

795
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,000
although the ones I've done, I've just soloed through them and...

796
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Thirteen people on Lapras yesterday.

797
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,000
We did a, there was a last, well, Friday, there was a last month,

798
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Ingres Farm, so it was like 20 of us Ingres players that all showed up over at Chicken Farm, right?

799
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,000
So, we went over to Chicken Farm, and so, of course, we're getting ready to start,

800
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
and, like, you know, you go through great lengths to make sure the opponents don't know that you're there,

801
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,000
waiting for the farm to start, and all of a sudden, just before we're about to start,

802
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
somebody goes, Lapras!

803
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:38,000
And, like, just a bunch of people take off for this, like, this particular gym,

804
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
that's down the street by one of the seedy bars,

805
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
and, like, there's, then a car pulls up,

806
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
so there's, like, ten of us Ingresers that were there for the farm,

807
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
and a car of three people, and we all took on Lapras,

808
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
and that thing fucking melted, with thirteen of us, it was awesome,

809
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
and I didn't catch the son of a bitch,

810
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
because I guess they've lowered the capture rate,

811
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
so some of those four-star Pokemon are really hard to catch.

812
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Yeah, so that's the thing, so you do the raids, so you fight the Pokemon,

813
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
you know, with your six Pokemon, you get the Pokemon,

814
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
you fight the Pokemon, you know, with your six Pokemon,

815
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
you can play with up to twenty people,

816
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,000
and then, after you're done, I think the number of balls you get

817
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
are based off of, like, how well you do,

818
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
so, like, how much damage you deal, that type of thing,

819
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
and so, you, once you're done, you get an opportunity to try to catch

820
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
whatever it was that was in the gym,

821
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
which is kind of nice, because some of the stuff that's in there is, you know,

822
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
pretty, you know, like, hard to get,

823
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
I mean, so it was kind of nice to be able to get some of those things.

824
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Um, so, but yeah, they are pretty weak, like, I had one,

825
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,000
it was, like, just a dark red, you know, with this, like, crappy ball,

826
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
I'm like, can I use, I'm gonna use this super,

827
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
because they have new berries on, we'll use this super berry

828
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
and see if that works, and it's like,

829
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
fuck your super berry, I'm still knocking this shit out of my way,

830
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
it's like, uh, what the fuck?

831
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Yeah, I fed that fucking Lapras, like, four golden berries,

832
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
and it didn't work.

833
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
It's like, what the fuck am I supposed to do with this golden berry shit?

834
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:02,000
A golden berry will also completely heal a Pokemon in a gym,

835
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
as opposed to just a little boost, just a tip there,

836
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
if you want to use it for that.

837
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
But don't forget, also, when you're doing raids,

838
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,000
use those magic candies, I forget what they're called,

839
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
like, any candy or whatever, like, use them,

840
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
like, don't fucking let them take up space in your inventory,

841
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,000
if you're walking a Dratini so you can get enough for your Dragonite,

842
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,000
do those one or two star raids every day so you get some of those candies

843
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,000
and make them Dratini candies so you can get your Dragonite.

844
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Like, that stuff is really helping.

845
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Now my big thing is, I finally hatched a Tyranitar this week,

846
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,000
so there's that, uh, now it's Porygon, fucking Porygon,

847
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
and all those, like, I have like four or five of those stupid upgrades

848
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
so I can get a Porygon 2.0, but like, since you,

849
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
which, isn't it weird that Porygon's not on gyms,

850
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
you would think that would be one of the raid things that people need,

851
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
but they're not really showing up.

852
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Wait, wait, so Magikarp.

853
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:59,000
I get why Magikarp's there, because those bonds that you catch on gyms are wonders,

854
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,000
so that's a good, um, somebody told me Magikarp's aren't in eggs anymore,

855
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
I didn't realize that, yeah, Magikarp's aren't in eggs anymore,

856
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
so Magikarp's on a gym is the only way you can somewhat guarantee yourself

857
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,000
a high IV Magikarp that you'll ultimately turn into a Gyarados.

858
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
So, there's that.

859
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Um, what else, I was gonna say about that, so yeah,

860
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
those are, it's pretty neat.

861
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
The other thing, though, that they kinda got rid of, though,

862
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
um, they said, I guess you earn coins now every ten minutes

863
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
that your Pokémon defends a gym, so you can rack up coins that way.

864
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Do you know how easy it is to get the 50 coin cap now?

865
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Like, go take gyms at 11 o'clock at night,

866
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
not that I should be encouraging you to play these games in the dark,

867
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
but, you know, get some gyms in neighborhoods at 11 o'clock at night

868
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
when it's less likely that kids will be out to take them right back,

869
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
and by the time you wake up in the morning, your Pokémon will get knocked off

870
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,000
and you'll have 50 coins, because you only have to sit on a gym for, like, eight hours.

871
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Now, they dropped the max from 100, which does have some feathers ruffled,

872
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
like I noticed in chat, SHO100Matt says,

873
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
I'm not really too happy about only being able to get 50 coins max a day

874
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
despite how many Pokémon you have in gyms.

875
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
There are some things they could do better with this system.

876
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Like, it does kinda suck that you could end up getting a Pokémon,

877
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
like, trapped on a gym for days and days and days,

878
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
because nobody's gonna knock it off, and you can't get coins from it.

879
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
So we were talking a little bit about this on Pokémon GO podcast this week,

880
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,000
and it was suggested that, well, it would be nice if you could go back to that gym

881
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
and, like, cash out from that Pokémon.

882
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
That would be really awesome, but not there yet.

883
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,000
So I think this system, for me, this system is a huge improvement,

884
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
but there's still things that could be done better.

885
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Yeah.

886
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,000
But in all, I'm really enjoying it because it makes me feel like I can play the gym game,

887
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,000
and I'm not having to knock down a gym of fucking 10 Pokémon

888
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
where eight of them are blissies.

889
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Or it was even more than 20 Pokémon, just some ridiculous amount of Pokémon.

890
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Yeah, gross.

891
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,000
And then you have to play through it a million times before it finally knocks the levels down.

892
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
But some of the Pokémon players are having problems with this

893
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
because if somebody really wants a gym, they'll take it.

894
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
There's nothing you can really do.

895
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,000
But welcome to the game of Ingress that I've been playing for a while.

896
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
If somebody really wants a portal, they'll take it,

897
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
and there's not a lot you can do about it.

898
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Can you remotely recharge? You can't remotely recharge.

899
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
No, you cannot.

900
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Anyway, I'm enjoying the changes, but I do see improvements,

901
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
especially with the coin redemption.

902
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,000
I absolutely think you should be able to go check in with Pokémon and withdraw coins.

903
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,000
And even still, with the whole new gyms and everything,

904
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
there's still no real scoring system.

905
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,000
There's nothing like Ingress where you can see the score for your team.

906
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
There's nothing.

907
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Yeah, that would still be nice to see.

908
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
It's slightly better than Useless now.

909
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Yes, it's playable.

910
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
And on top of that, real quick, I wanted to mention,

911
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:55,000
along with these new features, they made some tweaks for people that they catch cheating.

912
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:00,000
They found new ways to punish players who have caught Pokémon using third-party software.

913
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:05,000
They said that they're going to appear marked with a slash in the inventory

914
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
and may not behave as expected.

915
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:10,000
With the announcement of raid battles and new battle features,

916
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,000
we are staying true to our commitment to ensure Pokémon GO continues

917
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
to be a fun and fair experience for all trainers.

918
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Starting today, Pokémon caught using third-party services that circumvent normal gameplay

919
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:27,000
will appear marked with a slash in the inventory and may not behave as expected.

920
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:32,000
We are humbled by the excitement for all new features that we announced yesterday, blah blah blah.

921
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Fuck spoofers, fuck spoofers, fuck spoofers.

922
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
If you are playing Pokémon GO as a spoofer, fuck you.

923
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,000
No, it's not fun.

924
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:45,000
These games are about getting up and going out and exploring the world around you.

925
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,000
If you're sitting doing it on your computer, you are contributing nothing.

926
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Go fuck yourself, and I am so happy that Niantic is doing things to fuck with you people

927
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:59,000
because I fucking hate this bullshit in Ingress and I hate this bullshit in Pokémon GO.

928
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Spoofers go to hell.

929
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,000
And that's how I feel about it.

930
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,000
How do you feel about it, Logi?

931
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
I'm not that bent out of shape about it because I don't really play...

932
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,000
No, it's like cheating in an MMO.

933
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
You don't fucking do it.

934
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:16,000
It doesn't bother me personally, though, because it's not like Ingress

935
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,000
where actually there's a score to the game.

936
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,000
There's no real game yet to it.

937
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,000
It is infuriating when 40 people work together to put up a field

938
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,000
and put together a game, and they're like,

939
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
40 people work together to put up a field

940
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,000
and one ass dickhead in his mom's basement with no pants on takes it down.

941
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,000
I'm saying yes, I agree.

942
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,000
That is crap, and Ingress and Cheaters suck,

943
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:41,000
but in Pokémon GO, there's no scoring or anything,

944
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,000
so it doesn't really bother me yet.

945
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
When there's an actual game and scores and stuff like that,

946
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,000
then that might be a different story.

947
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
But yes, cheating still sucks.

948
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Akdeft and Chat says,

949
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Spoofers are bad and they should feel bad.

950
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Look, if you want to run your own copy of Pokémon GO

951
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
on your own server where you can do whatever you want in a one-player mode,

952
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,000
go fucking do whatever makes you happy.

953
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Listen, Pokémon GO is made in Unity.

954
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Make your own fucking Pokémon GO.

955
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Brad from Pod Culture says,

956
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Rob Roberts, what about folks who are mobility impaired and can't get out?

957
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:17,000
I think Pokémon GO has gone to lengths to ensure that,

958
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,000
I mean, if you're mobility impaired,

959
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:24,000
wouldn't you still be able to go to wheelchair accessible areas,

960
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000
like, you know, all parks?

961
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
As far as I know, unless it's a mountain or something,

962
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,000
you can use a wheelchair to get around.

963
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
You can still play at home.

964
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
You can just buy Poké Balls and throw them at the critters that walk by.

965
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
But, what was I going to say?

966
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Really, the way they should be punishing these people that cheat in those games,

967
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
they should have to play Garfield GO.

968
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Yes, you should have to be playing Garfield GO, absolutely.

969
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
So, Brad continues on,

970
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
there for many months I had mobility issues and couldn't drive.

971
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:01,000
It's one of those things where I feel sympathy for that situation

972
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000
and that's really unfortunate,

973
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:10,000
but that doesn't give somebody the right to then go and play this game on easy mode

974
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:14,000
that a lot of people are having to really work to,

975
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
you know, take down things like gyms and stuff like that.

976
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:22,000
I just don't think it excuses the act of spoofing at the end of the day.

977
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,000
There are still things that you can do, you know,

978
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
in certain parks and other publicly accessible areas.

979
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
It's one of those things where I feel sympathy,

980
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,000
but it doesn't excuse the act of spoofing to me.

981
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
I've been in my boot, you know what I've been doing?

982
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:44,000
I ask people to stop me by there if they get a ride.

983
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
I catch Pokémon from my bathroom.

984
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
You find ways to make it work, you know?

985
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Exactly, I can't hit a Pokéstop maybe every day,

986
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
but I can get my one catch a day.

987
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Like when I was super sick and trying to play Ingress,

988
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
either I just broke the damn hacking streak

989
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
or I would just say like,

990
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,000
alright, I'm gonna just leave the houses once to go to the nearest portal

991
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,000
and come right back to keep my streak going, you know?

992
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,000
The whole thing is that in the end, it's a game,

993
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
and don't screw it up for everybody else just because you're inconvenienced.

994
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Yes, so.

995
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Anyway, well, okay, and then Brad from Pod Culture continues,

996
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
on the other hand, there's a Pokéstop I can reach from my couch.

997
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Well, there you go. It's not so bad.

998
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Anyway, look, I realize that it gets into a more controversial issue

999
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
when we start talking about these other types of challenges,

1000
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,000
and I am all, do not get me wrong,

1001
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
I am all for accessibility in gaming.

1002
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,000
I am all for always having remappable controls,

1003
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,000
being able to do visual editing and all these easy fixes in games,

1004
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,000
but I draw the line at spoofing your location

1005
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:54,000
to fake to people that you're at the top of a mountain in the middle of snow season

1006
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
when everybody knows that is fucking impossible for anybody,

1007
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
able-bodied or otherwise, to be able to do.

1008
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
So that's kind of where I draw the line,

1009
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,000
and I hope you guys can see the difference.

1010
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Anyway.

1011
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,000
No, don't even with that clickbait news headline, people.

1012
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Alright.

1013
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:16,000
SSU100Matt says, Rob did go outside in single-digit temperatures with Windchill

1014
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
to play Ingress during Magfest. Confirmed.

1015
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Yes, that did happen. That was one of the stupidest things I've ever done in my life.

1016
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Alright, let's talk about a less bad gaming decision, shall we?

1017
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,000
And that would be the decision to put Pac-Man Versus on the Nintendo Switch.

1018
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Yeah, that's gonna be awesome.

1019
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Did you guys ever play Pac-Man Versus?

1020
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,000
No.

1021
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Well, now you'll have a chance.

1022
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Jamie, how does Pac-Man Versus work, if you remember?

1023
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
You have one person as Pac-Man and the other people who are the ghosts.

1024
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
That's right. And the ghosts have their own screen,

1025
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,000
and like Pac-Man's on the TV or something, right?

1026
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,000
So, anyway, what's gonna happen is this is gonna come to the Switch,

1027
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,000
but it's part of another collection.

1028
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
There's a collection called the Namco Museum Collection,

1029
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:01,000
and this collection is gonna include other Namco games as well,

1030
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
including Pac-Man and Dig Dug, which shows up everywhere.

1031
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:09,000
But stuff like Galaga 88, Sky Kids, Splatterhouse, Rolling Thunder 1 and 2.

1032
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
So that's pretty cool. Some other deep cuts from Namco in there.

1033
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:17,000
But yet, no Mappy. Why does Namco continue to hate Mappy Dark Sakura?

1034
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,000
I don't know either. I don't understand this either.

1035
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Alright, anyway, but Pac-Man Versus is gonna be a part of this as well.

1036
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,000
So, unfortunately, you can't just do it all on one Switch.

1037
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,000
That's not gonna work very well for the game.

1038
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:34,000
However, each team needs their own Switch, but you can do up to three people on one console.

1039
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
So you could have one person being Pac-Man on their Switch,

1040
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
and another three people being the ghosts on another Switch.

1041
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:44,000
So that's something possible you can do. So, very cool about that.

1042
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:49,000
That collection is releasing on July 28th, so you don't have a long time to wait for that.

1043
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:54,000
So that's pretty cool. I can't wait to finally really get to spend some time playing Pac-Man Versus,

1044
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,000
because I didn't really get to before.

1045
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Moving on, Dark Sakura.

1046
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Well, there's been a lot of talk about it. We've brought it up already.

1047
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:10,000
But, there is that new Super Nintendo Mini Classic thingy that's coming out, right?

1048
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,000
The SNES Classic.

1049
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:16,000
It's going to have 21 classic Super Nintendo games in it,

1050
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:21,000
but among them is going to be a game that was heavily advertised,

1051
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
and then dropped off the face of the Earth.

1052
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,000
And that is Star Fox 2.

1053
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Star Fox 2 had a lot of different new mechanics in it. I've played a ROM of it before.

1054
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:36,000
You have walker mode in there, and different characters and everything.

1055
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:42,000
But, as far as games that were mostly completed and never released,

1056
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Star Fox 2 has been a big one up there for a lot of fans of the series.

1057
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:50,000
We didn't have anything between the first Star Fox and Star Fox 64 that came out.

1058
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:54,000
This one had been in all of the magazines.

1059
01:07:54,000 --> 01:08:01,000
There was a playable version at the 1995 Consumer Electric Show.

1060
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
But, where did it go?

1061
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
So, we're going to finally get it.

1062
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:15,000
I think that is so rad that a game from the archives that long ago is going to be available now all these years later.

1063
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,000
It's kind of similar a little bit to what they did with Earthbound Zero on the Wii U,

1064
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
although obviously this is a little different, these classics.

1065
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,000
I'm a little worried about being able to get my hands on one.

1066
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,000
And yes, I'm well aware Nintendo has said,

1067
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Oh, don't worry you guys, there's going to be more of them available.

1068
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:36,000
It's one of those I'll believe it when I see it sort of things.

1069
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:42,000
It's very easy to walk into Target today and find Atari flashbacks, Sega Genesis.

1070
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
It's very easy to find those things still on the shelf.

1071
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Now, granted, I realize those things don't have the same hype behind them that the Super Nintendo does,

1072
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:53,000
although the Genesis was rad too, so I don't understand why everybody's hating.

1073
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,000
But anyway, I just...

1074
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Probably because they've released it so many times.

1075
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:02,000
I just don't see Nintendo being able to meet that same type of demand.

1076
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Nintendo fucking loves this scarcity of their stuff and how it makes the lines show up on the nightly news and all this stuff.

1077
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,000
And I'm not going to buy into it again.

1078
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:16,000
I didn't with the Nintendo Classic, I never did get one, and I'm going to pass with that.

1079
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Congratulations, but I'm not... I didn't have a hookup like you guys did, and I'm just not...

1080
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,000
There's only certain links I'm going to go to.

1081
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
I'm just trying to figure out what possibly they could, aside from like,

1082
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Okay, look, Nintendo's popular.

1083
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,000
People know who Nintendo is, it's not like they don't know what Nintendo is.

1084
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,000
What's a Nintendo? What are they trying to accomplish?

1085
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,000
All they're doing is frustrating their base.

1086
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
I mean, these are people that are fans of this stuff that are looking to buy it,

1087
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:48,000
to maybe even share it with their children, to get younger kids interested in these games.

1088
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:55,000
And they're pulling this dick shit that they've been doing since the Wii. It's ridiculous.

1089
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Granted, these same people can also find an NES at the flea market and get an EverDrive.

1090
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Or you could, hypothetically, buy the NES in the cartridges.

1091
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Or get the AVS.

1092
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Although the original NES doesn't run on HDMI, these things do.

1093
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
So there is, you know, you can't...

1094
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,000
It's a convenient package.

1095
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
It is a convenient package, yes.

1096
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,000
But I'm at the mindset that I am with the NES Classic.

1097
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
If Nintendo wants me to have one, I'll get one.

1098
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,000
And I'll be happy to buy it.

1099
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
And yes, the game collection in here sounds pretty fucking awesome.

1100
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,000
Sure, I could put together a Raspberry Pi in an emulator and do all that shit.

1101
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Sure, I could do that.

1102
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
But I think if that's your instant response to these types of things...

1103
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Right here, this is my fucking response if I can't find one.

1104
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
I already have a fucking Raspberry Pi.

1105
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
I just need to fucking load Retro Pi on it.

1106
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:47,000
But it's one of those things where it would be nice to have the official hardware with the official control and all that stuff.

1107
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:51,000
That is nice to have and I'm willing to pay that if Nintendo wants me to have one.

1108
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
But if Nintendo doesn't want me to have one, then I'm not going to get one.

1109
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
I like the front end. I wish someone would dump that. Then I really don't need one.

1110
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,000
But I want to make this clear, too.

1111
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Since I'm on rants tonight, how about another one?

1112
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Fuck scalpers. Fuck scalpers. Fuck scalpers. Fuck you if you're a scalper.

1113
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Don't fucking buy from scalpers because that encourages them.

1114
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:17,000
And I'm going to tell you right here and now, that is one thing that I am not going to do is buy from a scalper.

1115
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
And I really wish you all would make that same promise with me.

1116
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:26,000
You're not going to fucking buy one of these from a scalper because that is just going to drive the cost of these things up online.

1117
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:30,000
That drives the scarcity to them. It is not fucking worth it.

1118
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:37,000
It's $80 now. It's not worth it to pay more than that, I think. I mean, it's worth $80. I'm not going to pay more than that.

1119
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:44,000
I will steal the games and put them on a Raspberry Pi. You can quote me on that.

1120
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:55,000
I will steal. S-T-E-A-L. Steal the games and put them on a Raspberry Pi before I will buy from a scalper. Period.

1121
01:11:55,000 --> 01:12:04,000
If that's what Nintendo wants me to do, then I will steal the games and put them on a Raspberry Pi before I will buy from a scalper.

1122
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:13,000
But fuck scalpers. And if everybody listening to every gaming, not this one because we don't have an audience, I can't imagine why.

1123
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:29,000
But if everybody out there listening to every gaming podcast, watching every Twitch stream, watching every YouTube out there would make the same promise to fuck scalpers and this is not that important, then we would not have these problems.

1124
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:42,000
So please, everybody, say it with me. Spread the word. Let your friends know. Scalpers end now. Done. Fuck scalpers. Steal instead.

1125
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:48,000
And remember, Star Fox 2 will be leaked to the internet immediately.

1126
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Yes, it will. Alright, anyway, the views and opinions expressed on Renaissance Radio. Anyway, alright, blah, blah, blah, disclaimer.

1127
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Let's see, going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com. ActDeaf says, I don't want a Raspberry Pi. I want a Super Nintendo Mini.

1128
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:17,000
It's cool to have that whole little package. It's nice to have the official controller and all that other stuff. In an officially licensed Nintendo product, I think that would be really cool.

1129
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:25,000
ActDeaf in chat says, I know a scalper. Well, fuck that person, him or her. ActDeaf says, I bought my NES Mini from a scalper.

1130
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:33,000
ActDeaf, I say this with love. I know you're a long time supporter of the show. You have to realize you contribute to the problem when you do that.

1131
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Now, I'm giving you a little more of a pass than I would give other people because I realize you live in another country.

1132
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:51,000
And with that brings its whole other slate of issues that goes with that. So, for that reason, I'm willing to be a little less harsh on you than I would be on other people.

1133
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:56,000
But you have to understand, we have to draw the line on these scalpers. Period.

1134
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:10,000
When are we going to say to ourselves, we're contributing to this culture? Our need to have it and we've got to have one under our tree at Christmas and all this stuff and I've got to have something my friends don't have.

1135
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:14,000
When are we going to recognize that that is what causes these issues to happen?

1136
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Just remember, Nintendo could easily put out virtual console games. It's been out on other systems. I'm not sure what the holdup is now. Why are they dicking us around like this?

1137
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Alright. Come on gumshoos and chat says Rob Roberts came to slay today. I've had two weeks to build this shit up, so here we go. Alright.

1138
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Anyway, let's move on before I go on more rants. Loki, I think you should talk about a game I've never played. That way I can't rant about it.

1139
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Alright, fine. So, let's see. Let's talk about Player Unknown Battlegrounds. You know, a game that they feature very briefly during the whole E3 press conferences.

1140
01:14:53,000 --> 01:15:01,000
But, of course, very popular amongst Twitch streamers and that type of thing. Of course, it is in early access. It's been out since March.

1141
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:14,000
But, it is going to be coming to consoles very soon. Microsoft, they showed it off during their conference and one of the things that they're talking about is hoping to develop cross platform play.

1142
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:29,000
And, of course, it is coming to Microsoft, but it's also coming to Sony systems as well. So, at least the Microsoft side I'm sure will work fine, but Sony, I don't know.

1143
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:39,000
They said cross network play between PC and console is definitely something we want to work to down the road. We don't anticipate we'll have any technical issues with that.

1144
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:49,000
If we're going to allow players to use controllers, we need to have aim assist added in and things like that. We're not going to be supporting it right away, but it's something we'd like to look into later on.

1145
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:56,000
I mean, it looks interesting. It looks like an interesting game. I play with controller. I don't do the mouse and keyboard crap.

1146
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:10,000
But, yeah, it is an issue now, especially when all these good games come out that want to do this cross platform play. Microsoft's willing to play ball and Sony is just kind of doing this.

1147
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:27,000
And, once again, the quote Jim Sterling, you know, Sony has put, or briefly, to summarize it, Sony is putting themselves in a position where people are going to look at Sony and they're going to realize that when you buy a game on Sony's platform, you're not getting the full game.

1148
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:38,000
You are going to be missing features from that game, whether it be full supports for modding in Bethesda games or cross platform play in other games.

1149
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Yeah, Sony needs to really figure this out because it's not a good look on Sony right now. The fact that it looks like they're standing alone.

1150
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Or even backwards compatibility. Let's go there too. Backwards compatibility.

1151
01:16:52,000 --> 01:17:01,000
It does scream arrogance a little bit on the cross platform stuff, but I'm hoping it's just a big misunderstanding from a legal standpoint and they will work it out before Christmas.

1152
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:16,000
And we can play Rocket League, just like we play Final Fantasy XIV, and we can play this Player Unknown as well. Would be nice. Even though it's not a game I have particularly played a lot of, or at all really, I'm just terrible.

1153
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:20,000
It's all like a first person, it's like Battle Royale, but a first person shooter, right? That's what this game is, right?

1154
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Yeah, it's like, you know.

1155
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:28,000
I'm just, I'm not usually good at first person shooters, but I should check it out, at least.

1156
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:34,000
It's like DayZ with, you know, no zombies. I don't think there's zombies in that game.

1157
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,000
No zombies?

1158
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,000
I'm pretty sure there's no zombies.

1159
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,000
You can't send a horde of zombies in to kill people?

1160
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:49,000
No, it's basically, it is like Battle Royale. You start out with a lot of people and you whittle it down to a few. But I mean, it looks neat.

1161
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Alright. Well, moving on and talking about the backwards compatibility of Xbox games on Xbox One, and of course Xbox One X.

1162
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:05,000
One of the big things that they unveiled at E3 this year was that original Xbox games are going to be backwards compatible, at least a selection of them.

1163
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:09,000
It doesn't mean the whole, all of them are going to be backwards compatible, but some of them will be.

1164
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Do realize, and Xbox has clarified this week, that modern features like achievements and widescreen resolutions, not going to be a part of this.

1165
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:26,000
I hope you all know what you said about achievements not being important because the original Xbox games are not going to have them because they didn't originally.

1166
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:32,000
So they're not going to go back and suddenly add them into the game. They're more focused on getting the game to actually work.

1167
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:42,000
That also goes with widescreen support because many of these games, being that the Xbox was the same generation as PlayStation 2, many of these games didn't have widescreen support.

1168
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Some of them did, like the later Xbox games did and the later PlayStation 2 games did too, but you have to realize some of the games will not suddenly have this in.

1169
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:58,000
So you may be playing games with black borders and all that, but hey, at least it's still backwards compatibility, and I think that's okay.

1170
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Same thing with the PlayStation games and that whole thing. If that's what's holding it up, who cares?

1171
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:10,000
Let the PlayStation 1 games be backwards compatible on PlayStation 4 with black borders and no achievements. Fine.

1172
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:14,000
But anyway, that's what's going to happen with the original Xbox games as well.

1173
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Phil Spencer said this all, by the way, on Twitter in a response to some tweets, saying, quote,

1174
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Most OG Xbox games didn't have widescreen. Can't really easily change the frame buffer aspect ratio on a shipped game from backwards compatibility.

1175
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:33,000
We run the OG code so the game will support what the original game supported.

1176
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:42,000
So there you go. I think that is to be expected and I'm really, it's weird because this particular article I'm looking at on a website here says,

1177
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:50,000
It's certainly disappointing, but I don't, what were you expecting? Like, they're not going to go back and necessarily reinvent all these old games.

1178
01:19:51,000 --> 01:20:01,000
So I don't think it's disappointing at all. I think it's great that they are allowing you to use these games that are almost 15 years old at this point and still use them on your Xbox One.

1179
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:05,000
I think that's great that they're even allowing that at all. So there you go.

1180
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:14,000
But you should also again anticipate it's not going to be your entire library of OG games. It wasn't on the 360 either, right?

1181
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Like DDR never was backwards compatible, like UltraMix and all that. You still can't play those games on the 360.

1182
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:28,000
So I would imagine those games are going to be out for Xbox One X. The only games confirmed so far are Crimson Skies and Fusion Frenzy.

1183
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:34,000
That's it. But Crimson Skies is a big one and the original Fusion Frenzy I know had a lot of fans as well.

1184
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Sequel is garbage. Yeah, Sequel is fucking one of the most garbage games I've ever played, but the original was pretty good.

1185
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Moving on, Dark Sakura.

1186
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:57,000
Well, BioWare is still being terrible to us. There is some DLC that BioWare was going to be putting out that apparently was cancelled.

1187
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:14,000
However, that was, it was half a hoax, but it was in the end correct that there was going to be no single player DLC update that comes out.

1188
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:24,000
So that is really disappointing. We're not going to get any expanded content, not like any of the other Mass Effect games had.

1189
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
This game got sold, this game got done so dirty.

1190
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Why do you think I'm so pissed off about that new game?

1191
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Well, you know, I have to confess something to you, Dark Sakura. When we were having our E3 breakdown show a couple weeks ago, you were talking about how you were upset about Anthem because of everything with Mass Effect.

1192
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:48,000
And I'm going to admit to you that at the time, because after looking at all the footage, I was like, okay, this Anthem thing looks like it's pretty cool and all this stuff.

1193
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:58,000
I didn't say this at the time, but I kind of thought you were being irrational about the whole thing because I kind of thought that, you know, I was like, there are two different games and all this sort.

1194
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:08,000
But I'm telling you this now because after reading this story and some of these other things that have come up about Mass Effect, I might kind of be there with you.

1195
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
This is exactly what I thought was going to happen.

1196
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:18,000
I'm so upset about how dirty this game got done.

1197
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:25,000
And I realized that the game had issues. So did the original Mass Effect.

1198
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:29,000
And that game had its chance to grow and get nurtured and all this other stuff.

1199
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:46,000
But now the fact that it's like, we're just going to fucking throw this in a hole in the ground and bury it and move on to this other hot new shit we have in town is kind of upsetting to somebody that's, you know, spent so much time on these games over the years and really embraced the culture and all that stuff.

1200
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:58,000
So my point of the story is Dark Sakura, in a way, I guess I'm sorry for a feeling I never told you I had, but the more this is going on, I kind of, I'm getting in a similar boat.

1201
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Like, why should I support BioWare's new IP when the same thing could just happen to that?

1202
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Well, here's the other thing, too, is that they also basically tabled the plans for a sequel to Andromeda.

1203
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,000
It's unfortunate.

1204
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:20,000
So it makes me want to get people out on a, I don't know, a Twitter campaign or something.

1205
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
But they have to know how people feel.

1206
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:31,000
But if it was enough to make them change the ending for Mass Effect 3, it could happen again. And this is something that's worthwhile.

1207
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,000
Well, I think it's worth getting antsy about.

1208
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Honestly, Dark Sakura, you know, to bring it back full circle, I think the best fan campaign would be to not buy Anthem.

1209
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:47,000
I'm not going to buy it. I'm going to buy the new Dragon Age because that's continuing the series.

1210
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:53,000
I'm not ready to completely say I'm not going to buy Anthem yet, but I just have to say this.

1211
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:59,000
The whole thing just feels like a kick in the balls or cooter, you know, whatever.

1212
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:08,000
I just have to say that I'm not as enthusiastic about this because I just feel like BioWare, like, really, like, fucked over my friend.

1213
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:13,000
You know, so why do I want to go support them on this new endeavor? I'm not really excited about that right now.

1214
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:22,000
Let's see. Dungeonbuster in chat says, if the story of its development was true, it was a huge mess of a project.

1215
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:28,000
And that's, like, when is the management going to take responsibility for how hard they fuck this game?

1216
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:33,000
You know, that's another big part of it as well. And these are the people that are now working on Anthem, right?

1217
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Let's see. SH2100Matt says, I've never seen a franchise torched and the fan base slapped in the face harder than this. It's frustrating. Yeah, it is.

1218
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:52,000
So anyway, it's one of those things where maybe I'll get over it by the time Anthem comes out, but I don't know.

1219
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:59,000
Right now, I just feel like there's a hundred other games to play from companies that will be supporting the games.

1220
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Well, I went out on a limb and actually just made it a tweet. To Bioware, I am not going to buy Anthem because of how badly you treated Mass Effect.

1221
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:15,000
And I'm going to stand by that. I don't see any point.

1222
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:25,000
If you had a successful franchise, you could have made it this amazing thing. And it was still really good. I thought it was still great.

1223
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:30,000
And that's the problem with this whole thing is that Andromeda is not that bad of a game.

1224
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
I thought it was a really good game.

1225
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:41,000
So, anyway. Well, we've talked about that at length already. I don't want to rehash it too much. It's upsetting.

1226
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:46,000
You know, everybody out there that listens to this show knows Jamie and I are longtime fans of this series.

1227
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:53,000
And this whole fact that they're just selling it up the river to move on to the next thing, it's upsetting. It sucks.

1228
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:57,000
I hope it doesn't happen to your favorite game someday.

1229
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,000
Alright.

1230
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:08,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, talk.

1231
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:10,000
Are we going to move on?

1232
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Please.

1233
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:18,000
Alright. Loki, what do you have for us? We'll get to the classic game of the week soon. We'll go back to a time and place when game companies didn't do games dirty like this.

1234
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,000
Loki, what do you have for us?

1235
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:36,000
Okay. So, apparently, the Guillemot family is working on trying to increase their stake in the company of Ubisoft in order to fend off the whole Viacom hostile takeover that they're doing.

1236
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:56,000
So, with that, currently, they had 13.6% of the shares with the voting rights of about 20%. And then, of course, in 2015, they had almost 30% of the company's share and about 25% of its voting rights.

1237
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:08,000
So, they're working on right now to kind of get that back up to those previous levels in order to have a better standing to kind of stop them from taking over the company.

1238
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:18,000
It's really interesting that Ubisoft has kind of made it clear time and time again they do not want this marriage, this takeover, but it's still trying to happen.

1239
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
And this has been going on for over a year, hasn't it?

1240
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,000
Yeah.

1241
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:24,000
This whole talk of takeover.

1242
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,000
Boy.

1243
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:32,000
Yeah, because they, Ubi was actually, they purchased its first stake in Ubisoft in 2015.

1244
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:35,000
Dark to see in chat.

1245
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:41,000
I'm sorry. Yeah, they own, actually, Ubisoft owns 27% of the company. So, yeah.

1246
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:48,000
Dark to see in chat says, I do wish we could get another Rayman game. I mean, a mainline series one, not more Rabbids, lol.

1247
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Well, if that Mario Rabbids thing does well, that'll put more money in Ubisoft and hopefully prevent this type of takeover. We'll see.

1248
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Or maybe he'll be in like the next Smash Brothers game or something.

1249
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:13,000
Yeah, anything's possible. I could definitely see like if they do a Smash Brothers remaster or whatever, which at this point, if it still hasn't been announced, I think they're just going to do a new Smash Brothers game, which is totally fine, obviously.

1250
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:20,000
I would say Rayman or one of the Rabbids has got to be a shoo-in for that. You would think.

1251
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:22,000
Yeah.

1252
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:29,000
Especially with this Mario Rabbids crossover. But anyway, to be argued at another time when they confirm whatever the future of Smash Brothers looks like.

1253
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:45,000
Meanwhile, let's talk about some other stuff with Nintendo, meaning their stance on fan games, because we all know that AM2R got the cease and desist and it turns out, oh, Nintendo was working on their own Metroid 2 remake, it turns out.

1254
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:51,000
But that also, you know, Nintendo has shut down Pokemon Uranium. You know, there's been other stuff that's got shut down as well.

1255
01:28:51,000 --> 01:29:07,000
So what's interesting is that there was an interview that happened at Waypoint where they were actually interviewing Reggie Fils-Aime and they kind of, you know, put him on the spot with some of these questions in regards to why does Nintendo, you know, aggressively, you know, protect its IP and all this stuff.

1256
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:23,000
So a question that they asked in this was, which is why wasn't there a chance, I'm sorry, why wasn't there a chance there or even has there been a chance to speak to that, working on the line between fandom and actual creation.

1257
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:30,000
To try to work with a fan creator like AM2R's Milton Gloste or other fan creators.

1258
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:39,000
And Reggie said, I think there needs to be clarity on what the line is. And in our view, the line is when an initiative crosses from being an homage to something that is monetizing our IP.

1259
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:48,000
We allow homages to exist in a variety of different ways. And for me personally, as a fan, before I was an executive, I understand the attraction that you could have to our IP.

1260
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:58,000
But when it transitions to something that now you're trying to monetize it, you're trying to sell, you're trying to profit off of it, that's what broaches or breaks through that line for us where we have to claim our IP protection.

1261
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:05,000
Now, of course, Waypoint in the interview is thinking the same thing a lot of you were thinking, there wasn't a cost for AM2R.

1262
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:11,000
So again, the question posed after that was, that was a game that anyone could download for free.

1263
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:21,000
And I think for fans, there was this notion of go talk to that person or go talk to other fan creators to see if there's a way to not kill that project to investigate the ideas that are happening there that are exciting and who knows.

1264
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:30,000
And Reggie answered with this, to differentiate this, we've had conversations with entities that started as fans and became more of a business partner.

1265
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:41,000
Those conversations happen all the time. But again, when something transitions to a commercial product, and that's what AM2R was, there wasn't a charge, but it was now a commercial product.

1266
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:51,000
Interesting distinction there by Reggie that AM2R, sure, it was free, but it was still a commercial project.

1267
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:57,000
I mean, look, it's easy to paint Nintendo as the bad guy in this picture.

1268
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:59,000
If it competes with our products, we don't like it.

1269
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:07,000
In a way. In a way, that's what it is. Because that game started getting all the YouTube and all the Twitch support and all that stuff.

1270
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:18,000
So sure, there was no charge for it, but it was sitting right there alongside these other Metroid games and maybe taking some of the attention away from Metroid when now we find out Nintendo's been working on their own thing.

1271
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:29,000
You know why they did that? Because it was something that fans wanted versus Metroid Prime Soccer Game, whatever the fuck that piece of shit was.

1272
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,000
Federation Force.

1273
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:40,000
Yes. That's why. Because it wasn't this shitty-ass game that stood in for a mainline Metroid game.

1274
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:45,000
It was something that fans wanted. They liked Metroid 2. It was a remake in Metroid 2. Let's do it.

1275
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:53,000
And don't get me wrong, I'm sure that they've got to know what people want. I mean, I hope.

1276
01:31:54,000 --> 01:32:05,000
To be fair, though, again, I don't want to necessarily rehash a topic, but I do think it's a little silly to think that Nintendo doesn't have every right to shut this shit down.

1277
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:09,000
Even I kind of get the sense that, yeah, there's a line that's crossed here.

1278
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:20,000
But where's the harm in it? I understand that they can shut down, but why can Sega be totally fine with fan games coming out and even promote fan games by including it in a console release of a game?

1279
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:32,000
You can acknowledge it's there or even better. Halo. There's a fan Halo game that's being worked on right now, and 343 Industries gave it their blessing.

1280
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:40,000
So why can't these companies say, hey, that's pretty cool, and guess what? We've got a game coming out that's pretty cool too.

1281
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:45,000
I think it's up to the company to decide whether they want to draw the line or not.

1282
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,000
Yeah, and they're fucking dicks. I'm sorry.

1283
01:32:47,000 --> 01:33:00,000
Okay, Loki, if I did a shot-for-shot remake of my favorite movie of all time, Showgirls, if I did a shot-for-shot remake of Showgirls and then I put that up on YouTube and I say, well, it's free, who cares?

1284
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:08,000
I mean, wouldn't Universal or whoever was behind distributed that movie, wouldn't they have a case to shut my YouTube down because I used somebody else's script?

1285
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:12,000
It's not the original movie, though, Loki. It's not Elizabeth Bird's movie.

1286
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:17,000
It's derivative, it's derivative, and it'd actually be under fair use because of that.

1287
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:28,000
Even if I did a shot-for-shot remake of Showgirls from the shooting script, every word, Universal will have no case against me because it's fair use. I don't think that's true. I think they would be able to shut it down.

1288
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:35,000
I think, I guess there's only one way to find out. Jamie, have you ever wanted to be in a movie?

1289
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:41,000
I'm not looking a pole. You don't know shit.

1290
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Well, she's really good. You get the part.

1291
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:59,000
With the fan games, though, it's not, okay, if you want to say if it's a shot-for-shot remake, it's not, so what? The level designs the same or similar. You can't copyright that.

1292
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:10,000
It's not, I mean, level design, I guess if you do it exactly the same, maybe you could make an argument there, but I think that Nintendo takes it a little too far.

1293
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:21,000
Granted, there's protecting your IP, but then there's Nintendo protecting their IP or Nintendo monetizing videos of their product and thinking that they should get some money from people fanning over their games.

1294
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:26,000
Fuck them. I'm sorry. I don't feel any sort of remorse for Nintendo.

1295
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:33,000
I've got to get some of these comments out. Bobby Blackwolf in chat says over at live.vognetwork.com, just because one business is okay with it doesn't mean another one isn't.

1296
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:45,000
Just because VoG is okay with people distributing our back episodes on their own server, I should say, Bobby, we only know that to be specific to OLR and your show. I haven't pulled the rest of the shows on this.

1297
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:55,000
I have a feeling they're in the same camp, but anyway, just because VoG is okay with people distributing our back episodes on their own servers doesn't mean that Twit is. Fair point.

1298
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:03,000
I mean, there's also a big difference there in that our shows aren't out to make money, whereas Twit, I believe, is trying to pay bills.

1299
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:07,000
But you see, it's a consumer product that you're not charging for, therefore you're evil.

1300
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:15,000
Let's see. Bobby Blackwolf goes on to say, so why should people buy the virtual console version if they can get a shot for shot remake of a game on PC for free?

1301
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:23,000
ActDef says, so can I make my own fan remake of Time to Car? I wish you would so someone will fucking finish it, ActDef.

1302
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
You can't remake something that hasn't been made yet.

1303
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:36,000
So then I can make my own version of Star Fox 2, or I can make my own Mother 3. It hasn't been released, therefore it doesn't exist.

1304
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:51,000
No, I get it, Loki. It's frustrating, and especially when you do see that one company lets people get away with it and another one doesn't.

1305
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
It just makes it seem like you're a dick and you're awesome.

1306
01:35:55,000 --> 01:36:06,000
It's frustrating because it's their fans showing it. They're not trying to release this to say, fuck you Nintendo, I'm going to make a better game than you and I'm going to sell Metroid and make money off of it.

1307
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:14,000
They're doing it because they love your game and they're so much in love with your game and that they want a new game to come out and it's just not coming out.

1308
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:19,000
So they're like, you know what, I'm just going to make this game because I love this franchise and everything.

1309
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:24,000
You see what the YouTube is. I love your products. I want to talk about your products and share these products.

1310
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:30,000
And what have you done along the way? You fucking C&D the people making games. You fucking monetize those fucking videos.

1311
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:40,000
What are you doing to your fans? This is only going to go so long. Oh, they're going to shorten the supply of a really highly demanded product from your company.

1312
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:44,000
What are you doing? Are you fucking retarded?

1313
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:48,000
You need to cease and desist this ranting because you're trying to out rant me on tonight's show.

1314
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:56,000
That's a given, but you know, I mean, all right, look, look, no, there's another side of this. I want to make sure we get out here. This is important. Okay.

1315
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:05,000
So here's another story on a somewhat related tangent is that, uh, Microsoft, there's this game out there called installation zero one.

1316
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:12,000
It's a fan made halo game that aims to bring the multiplayer halo experience to all the various PC platforms.

1317
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:19,000
Installation zero one is being built in unity five, and they're saying it's the best part of the classic bungee era halo games.

1318
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:24,000
It's going to recreate the halo two and three experience, but there's elements of combat evolved and reach in there.

1319
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:35,000
The developers stressing they are operating under Microsoft's game content usage rules. All assets were created from scratch or obtained through the unity asset store.

1320
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:42,000
Uh, so, uh, they actually ended up, there's actually been a meeting and this was talked about on the installation zero one website.

1321
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:47,000
They had a Skype call with three, four, three industries who is of course now behind halo.

1322
01:37:48,000 --> 01:38:03,000
And, uh, they stated through these interactions, we've been ensured that installation zero one is not under imminent legal threat provided we remain non-commercial in nature and scope and continue to follow Microsoft's game content usage rules to the letter.

1323
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:09,000
So they will never be accepting donations. They will not be selling it or halo related merchandise.

1324
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:14,000
That is to keep a respectful distance between us and Microsoft's intellectual property.

1325
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:19,000
And fine, put out some like as Bobby likes to try to point the counterpoint there for myself.

1326
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:24,000
Hey Nintendo, we're going to take all your characters and worlds and make our own games with it and you have to be okay with it no matter what.

1327
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:29,000
We're fans. Then you know what? Fuck Nintendo, have them put out some guidelines in so we can make our own fan games.

1328
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Because honestly, let's be honest here. If the guideline is don't, here's my guideline.

1329
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:41,000
Nintendo, if I wanted to make a fucking fan game guideline, I gave you the guideline.

1330
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:48,000
Here's how you fucking do it. You don't be dumb and show your progress. You've make the game, you finish it, you throw it out there and say, fuck them.

1331
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:53,000
Where are they going to take it down? It's on the internet. That's what you do. That's how you release a fan game.

1332
01:38:53,000 --> 01:39:03,000
Give the finger and run. No, seriously. Put that shit on fucking torrent sites. What the fuck are they going to do? C and D torrent sites? No.

1333
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:09,000
They can try. It's on the internet. They don't know how the internet works anyways. My god. Sue me.

1334
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:13,000
They're like, internet? How do we get that? We need to sue this internet.

1335
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:18,000
Just get Nina Bonina Brown to put out your game. Sue me.

1336
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:26,000
Sue me. Walk off dramatically. Alright, anyhow, let's go back to a classic time in gaming.

1337
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:31,000
This is just, oh, this is so, the vapors, the vapors. This is a very exhausting show tonight.

1338
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:35,000
When I didn't have to go to work. I could call in sick to school.

1339
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:46,000
It's the classic game of the week where Dark Soccer is going to walk into the gaming vault and hopefully we won't get seized and desisted over the audio we're about to play from this classic game in the archives.

1340
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:49,000
Good one. Really good one tonight. Real classic tonight.

1341
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:55,000
I was going to use it before and then I found other things to use. Yes. So I saved it for tonight.

1342
01:39:56,000 --> 01:40:01,000
So here it is. The first game of our post-15 year episode. Yep. Alright, here it is.

1343
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:06,000
And y'all will probably go like, didn't you do this before? And the answer is, uh-uh.

1344
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:12,000
Alright, what is the classic game of the week tonight? Castlevania 3, Dracula's Curse.

1345
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:23,000
This is a big one. Yes, it is. Or this one was referred to in Japan as Akuma Jodensetsu, which is Devil Castle's legend.

1346
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:32,000
It was the third and final of the games in the Castlevania series that was produced for the NES.

1347
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:39,000
It came out in 1989 in Japan and in North America in 1990 and Europe 1992.

1348
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:44,000
It actually came out after the release of Super Castlevania 4 in Europe.

1349
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:49,000
And we did have of course virtual console releases and all of that.

1350
01:40:50,000 --> 01:41:00,000
But basically this particular game was a prequel to the original Castlevania game that was set a few centuries before the original game.

1351
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:06,000
So it starred Trevor Belmont as the ancestor to Simon Belmont.

1352
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:08,000
Bermondo.

1353
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:22,000
Anyway, the game that, this one, it returned back to its platform, I would say, roots like the first Castlevania game instead of the action adventure that Castlevania 2 was.

1354
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:32,000
But this one is fairly non-linear though. You also had characters who could assist.

1355
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:42,000
Like you had Grant who had his stab attack.

1356
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:54,000
Although if I do recall correctly on the disc version of this, he had a projectile with his knives, his Grant dynasty.

1357
01:41:55,000 --> 01:42:01,000
And then you could play as Alucard who could turn into a bat and shoot fireballs.

1358
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:03,000
And then...

1359
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:05,000
Life goals.

1360
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
Life goals to turn into a bat and spit out fireballs.

1361
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:15,000
But this game was really, I would say, just really in-depth.

1362
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:28,000
Oh, and you also could play as Saifa Belnades, who is also in, I think, canon now is considered to be one of the Belmont ancestors as well.

1363
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:30,000
But a sorceress.

1364
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:32,000
Like magic. Ooh, magic.

1365
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:40,000
But this particular game had some very interesting technical differences with it.

1366
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:48,000
It had a, in the Japanese version, the original one, it had a VRC6 coprocessor chip.

1367
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:53,000
And the game's audio programmer had his fingers in this one.

1368
01:42:53,000 --> 01:43:01,000
What it did, it had two extra pulsewave channels and a solid channel to add to the initial five sound channels.

1369
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:05,000
So it had much better music capability.

1370
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:10,000
In the US, the NES didn't have the ability to use external sound chips.

1371
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:18,000
So we just had the MMC5 chip, which basically didn't do anything.

1372
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:20,000
It was a downgrade of the music.

1373
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:27,000
If you ever get a chance to find some of the Japanese music, definitely, definitely look at the Japanese version. It's pretty amazing.

1374
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:35,000
Although I do think that now the AVS systems will make use of the external chips.

1375
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
So find yourself a Famicom version of this.

1376
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:45,000
In other things, you also had some hidden features.

1377
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:51,000
In the North American and PAL versions, you could enter in a code that said, help me.

1378
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
So you could start with ten lives.

1379
01:43:55,000 --> 01:44:02,000
And with any of the three spirit partners and the more difficult quests unlocked, this was not in the Japanese version.

1380
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:09,000
It had, Castlevania 3 had different artwork outside of Japan.

1381
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
It was the first game in the series that did.

1382
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:25,000
And the same artist, Tom Dubois, also did the artwork for Super Castlevania IV, Castlevania II, Belmont's Revenge, and Castlevania Bloodlines.

1383
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:29,000
So, really, really, really decent work.

1384
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:40,000
This is also listed by Nintendo Power as the 9th best NES game that had so many more improvements over it.

1385
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:47,000
I honestly, if it wasn't for Dracula X, I would put this at my top of Castlevania games.

1386
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:57,000
But, because I don't know, I still kind of think of Symphony of the Night as its own kind of new type of Castlevania game.

1387
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:05,000
I still think that Dracula X is the better game that still has the same platforming features like this one did.

1388
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:10,000
But, this game is really up there. It is one of the best.

1389
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:21,000
It also had, there was a soundtrack that was released with the original Famicom music of it.

1390
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:30,000
There was also an animated movie that was in development since 2007 with Warren Ellis writing, for one thing.

1391
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:43,000
And then, it finally got its, there was a tease for the animated version, and now we have, the animation is going to be out on Netflix.

1392
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
So, it should be out on July 7th.

1393
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:52,000
God, I didn't realize it was that soon. Wow, that's great.

1394
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:56,000
So, nice as a little precursor to our Castlevania.

1395
01:45:56,000 --> 01:46:00,000
Though, I noticed Grant is not listed among the people that they have voice cast.

1396
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:02,000
He might be too de-nasty.

1397
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
Or they wrote him out, sadly.

1398
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
Why? He was like one of my favorite characters in it.

1399
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:12,000
They gotta say something for Season 2, maybe.

1400
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:14,000
As long as they leave Sypha in it.

1401
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:21,000
You know what I would want, though, is I would want a Dracula X animated thing. That would just be awesome.

1402
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:31,000
Nothing but, but, um, Richter Belmont in his sleeveless 80s with his headband outfit. Hi, I look like I'm Ryu, but I'm in a Konami game.

1403
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:33,000
What about animated Silent Hill?

1404
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:35,000
Why not?

1405
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:40,000
Um, I guess. It's gotta be better than some of those later sequels turn out to be.

1406
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:42,000
I did like the movies.

1407
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:44,000
I did like P.T.

1408
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:46,000
P.T. was great. Rest in peace.

1409
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:53,000
By the way, I forgot to say, I have the, um, P.T. Unity on my Mac.

1410
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:55,000
Oh, yeah?

1411
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:57,000
And it actually is pretty, pretty close and pretty fun.

1412
01:46:58,000 --> 01:46:59,000
Nice.

1413
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,000
So, it's still out there to download. People can play it.

1414
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
But, anyway, back to this. Castlevania 3.

1415
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
Akuma Joudensets.

1416
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
I don't, my voice is screwed up right now, so I can't make it sound cool.

1417
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:12,000
Is that it?

1418
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:14,000
Oh, there it is. Alright.

1419
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:15,000
Classic game of the week. Castlevania 3.

1420
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:17,000
Dracula's Curse.

1421
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
Now, I must confess, I love this game. Don't get me wrong.

1422
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:27,000
And I think I, I think I told you all the story about how I was the guy who figured out first how to get this to work in an emulator.

1423
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:32,000
And then the little IRC group I was with put it out there, put the fixed ROM out there for the masses.

1424
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:34,000
But, so I do love this game.

1425
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:39,000
But, um, Castlevania 2, Simon's Quest, I think is my favorite on the NES.

1426
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:41,000
I know, don't, stop rolling your eyes at me.

1427
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
I think it's more of a sentimental favorite, more than anything else.

1428
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:45,000
This game is so bad.

1429
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:47,000
No, it's not. I love it.

1430
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:49,000
Okay.

1431
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:51,000
Why do you, why do you hate it so, hater hater.

1432
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:53,000
It's a terrible night for a curse.

1433
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:55,000
That's right.

1434
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:57,000
Grind, grind, grind, grind.

1435
01:47:58,000 --> 01:47:59,000
It has good music, but it's so grindy.

1436
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:01,000
I don't have time for no grinder.

1437
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:03,000
Maybe that's the difference between you and I.

1438
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
I don't mind a little grinder here and there, but you got no time for it.

1439
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:08,000
Alright.

1440
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:10,000
Swipe all you want.

1441
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:12,000
So when we come back, there's plenty more show to come,

1442
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
including some stories on Grand Theft Auto, Overwatch,

1443
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:17,000
and how about some Dead or Alive as well.

1444
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
We'll get to all that when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1445
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:22,000
Your calls as well, so don't go anywhere.

1446
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:24,000
We'll be back after this.

1447
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:35,000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio Live on this Sunday night,

1448
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:40,000
July the 2nd of 2017 with episode number 692 of our show.

1449
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
I don't know if we have anybody in Canada who's listening live,

1450
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
but if you are, I hope you all had a great Canada Day yesterday.

1451
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
And I'm sure those of you that are listening on the podcast feed

1452
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:51,000
may appreciate a belated happy Canada Day.

1453
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
And of course, to everybody in the United States,

1454
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:56,000
we have the 4th of July coming up,

1455
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
so I hope you all have a great and safe, of course, 4th of July.

1456
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
I hope no idiot sets off a firework too close to you.

1457
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:04,000
I don't know about you guys,

1458
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
I've already been setting them off all week long here,

1459
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
and I'm already over it, but you know,

1460
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
fireworks aside, the 4th of July is certainly an important day,

1461
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
so yeah, I hope you all have a great holiday.

1462
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
It is kind of weird what it's doing to this work week, though.

1463
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:21,000
I don't know about you guys, I have to work Monday,

1464
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:23,000
then I have Tuesday off, then I have work the rest of the week.

1465
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
It's a little weird, but whatever. I will take a day off.

1466
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:28,000
Do you guys have any exciting plans for 4th of July?

1467
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:30,000
I don't want to be around other humans,

1468
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:32,000
so I'm going to stay in the cats shuttering at the fireworks.

1469
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:34,000
So you'll have an introvert day, basically.

1470
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
Nothing wrong with that. I may actually do the same thing.

1471
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
I'm thinking maybe it might be a good movie day, if anything,

1472
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:44,000
but otherwise Hubs and I don't really have any plans.

1473
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:46,000
Spider-Man is coming up soon,

1474
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:48,000
but I think that's not until Friday, though.

1475
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
Yeah, I think it's before the weekend or something.

1476
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:53,000
I still need to see Wonder Woman,

1477
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:55,000
but I figure that's in a theater still somewhere.

1478
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:57,000
I want to go.

1479
01:49:58,000 --> 01:49:59,000
I haven't seen it yet.

1480
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,000
You still haven't seen it? It surprises me.

1481
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:03,000
Do you hate DC that much? I'm just kidding.

1482
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:07,000
No. When we tried to go before, there was a crazy line,

1483
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:09,000
and I didn't want to deal with that many people.

1484
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:11,000
Gotcha. That makes sense.

1485
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
Bobby in chat says Rob's going to livestream on Twitch all day.

1486
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
I might. If the movie thing doesn't end up happening,

1487
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:19,000
maybe I'll play something.

1488
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:21,000
You can watch Summer Games done quick.

1489
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:23,000
I can, but I think we're going to get to that in just a little bit.

1490
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
A little more on that as we get into some rapid-fire news.

1491
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:28,000
So let's get to it. Loki.

1492
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:34,000
Alright, so Blizzard finally announced the date for the StarCraft Remastered.

1493
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:39,000
That's going to be coming out on August 14th on PC for $14.99.

1494
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:44,000
And of course it has the upgraded graphics, the expansion, Brood War,

1495
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:52,000
also Ultra HD and 4K support, matchmaking, leaderboards, all that fun stuff.

1496
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:54,000
Remastered music.

1497
01:50:54,000 --> 01:51:04,000
So look for that, and the price, that's definitely better than, say, $40 for a standalone version of Call of Duty Remastered.

1498
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:06,000
Modern Warfare.

1499
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:15,000
And then of course, with that, PlayStation Plus and Xbox Live games with gold.

1500
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:19,000
Lots of freebies for the month of July, so starting off with PlayStation Plus.

1501
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
This month we get Until Dawn, which is pretty awesome.

1502
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:25,000
Game of Thrones, the telltale game.

1503
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
And then of course on PlayStation, those are on PlayStation 4.

1504
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:33,000
PS3 gets Tokyo Jungle and Darkstalkers Resurrection.

1505
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:39,000
And then on Alveda, Elemental 4 looks like 41 or 4L.

1506
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:44,000
And Don't Die, Mr. Robot, which is cross-buy on PlayStation 4.

1507
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:46,000
Sweet.

1508
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:56,000
And then they also said that along with that, that That's You, which is, I guess, that new party game that they showed off.

1509
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:58,000
No, it's you!

1510
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:04,000
Yes, will be free to all PlayStation Plus members from July 4th to October 24th.

1511
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:06,000
Oh, that's cool.

1512
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:08,000
So that'll be something that's coming as well.

1513
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Yay, free game.

1514
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:12,000
So hey, that's pretty cool.

1515
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:19,000
That's a sweet lineup for July, because I don't know how long Shane's been begging me to buy Until Dawn and stream it, which, you know, I hate those jumpy scare games.

1516
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:23,000
But now it's free, so it's pretty hard to say no to free.

1517
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:33,000
Yes. On the Xbox front, we've got starting July 1st, you can get Grown Up, and that's on Xbox One.

1518
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:40,000
And then, of course, they have Kane & Lynch 2 Dog Days on Xbox One, or 360, of course.

1519
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:48,000
That's until July 15th, and then from July 16th through the end of the month, or I'm sorry, into August 15th, you can get Runbow.

1520
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:57,000
And Lego Pirates of the Caribbean will be on Xbox One, Xbox 360 from the middle of the month to the end of July.

1521
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:02,000
Nice. Free games, asterisk, if you pay a yearly subscription fee.

1522
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:04,000
But still.

1523
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
It's better than one or two console, er, virtual console games.

1524
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:09,000
Stop being shady. Alright.

1525
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:17,000
Let's talk about, speaking of the Switch, and what it kind of has instead of virtual console right now, it has those Neo Geo games, right?

1526
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:24,000
The ACA Neo Geo, which I did buy, I forgot to mention it during my gaming week, but I did pick up Magical Drop 2 came out on Switch this week.

1527
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:28,000
And I like those games, as far as the puzzle-y type of games go.

1528
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
Surely you know the Magical Drop games, right, Dark Sakura? Are you a fan?

1529
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:34,000
Yes. I have one of them for Neo Geo CD.

1530
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:36,000
Oh, nice. I didn't even know they released it on CD.

1531
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:41,000
Well, Magical Drop 2 came out on Switch this past week, so I downloaded that.

1532
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:46,000
Because I thought that would be a good game, because I think it's also on PlayStation 4 and probably Xbox One as well.

1533
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:52,000
But I thought that would be a good one because you can play it on the TV, or you can pick it up and go and play it with other people and all that stuff.

1534
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:54,000
So I thought that would be a good one.

1535
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:58,000
Well, there are more Neo Geo games confirmed that will be coming to Switch.

1536
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:03,000
And this is all part of a Nico Nico livestream that happened, part of the Arcade Archive series.

1537
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:13,000
Games confirmed, I mentioned during the series, Samurai Showdown, Super Sidekicks, King of Fighters 2000, Arrow Fighters 2,

1538
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:20,000
and probably my favorite Neo Geo fighter they ever did, Fatal Fury Special is coming out as part of that as well.

1539
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
Which is basically Fatal Fury 2+, is what that is.

1540
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:28,000
Fatal Fury 2, but with all the one characters that you couldn't play in that game, now playable.

1541
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:30,000
Like Tung Fu Ru and Duck King and all that.

1542
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:34,000
So I will definitely be picking up Fatal Fury Special.

1543
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:39,000
But we don't know exactly what day, we just know they are coming in the coming months.

1544
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:41,000
That's it. The future.

1545
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:46,000
By the way, speaking of free games, over in chat at live.vognetwork.com,

1546
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:51,000
Ragenator is saying, remember, Yaris was free. Could you say no to Yaris?

1547
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:57,000
Alright look, maybe not every free game is awesome, but the That's You sounded kind of neat.

1548
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:02,000
Our pal Slidekick from Game Buoy is in chat saying, Runbow is a delight.

1549
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:08,000
I have not checked out Runbow, but I will check it out since it is available as part of this Xbox Gold stuff.

1550
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:13,000
Speaking of the Switch, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe got an update this last week.

1551
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:18,000
It is now on version 1.2. Some more Amiibo functionality included with this.

1552
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:22,000
That's what I was, I forgot I played another game. Mario Kart 8.

1553
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
Oh did you, on Wii U? Or did you actually play the Switch version?

1554
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:27,000
I played the emulator version.

1555
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:29,000
Oh you.

1556
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:33,000
I own it! I can fucking do that if I want to. I have the disc version.

1557
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:35,000
You do own it?

1558
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
I have the digital download, so I played it on my PC and it runs fantastic.

1559
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:43,000
You do, you do. Alright anyway, so now in 1.2 of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe,

1560
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:47,000
you can use Pikmin Theme Amiibo to unlock a Pikmin suit for the Mii Driver.

1561
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:52,000
Race rules and course name are on loading screens during online and wireless play.

1562
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:58,000
That's kind of nice because that Cops and Robbers game, I had no idea what the hell that was about until I finally got in and played that.

1563
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:04,000
If you're behind in an online match, you will get items geared towards catching up more frequently.

1564
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:12,000
I wonder how that's going to affect the shine grab game because that seems like it's always over in a heartbeat as soon as somebody can hold onto that shine for just a few seconds.

1565
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:20,000
Some other stuff, if you use an item right after the Super Horn in an online match, the item will remain available for other players.

1566
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:22,000
I guess there was a bug before that.

1567
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
And the item wheel will no longer spin continuously in online matches.

1568
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:33,000
Online matches will end as intended 30 seconds after the first place racer finishes, so no more trolling in that case.

1569
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:39,000
And communication errors no longer occur frequently while spectating or after spectating online matches.

1570
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:45,000
I hope that fixes some of the same room gaming problems I was having when JD and I were trying to play Mario Kart a couple weeks ago.

1571
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:47,000
That would be very nice to have that fixed.

1572
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
DarkSakura, what do you have for us in rapid fire news?

1573
01:56:51,000 --> 01:57:00,000
Well, we had mentioned in part one about the Castlevania series that's coming out on Netflix in a few days, really.

1574
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:14,000
But they've listed a voice cast. We have Graham McTavish who played Charlie Cutter in Uncharted and Dwalin in The Hobbit.

1575
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:22,000
We have Richard Armitage as Trevor Belmont. We have James Callas from Battlestar Galactica as Alucard.

1576
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:29,000
And Alejandra Reynoso as Saifah Benades. And there's a full list that's out there online.

1577
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:39,000
And then in other news, which was actually going on when I left my house, we have Summer Games Done Quick is going on right now.

1578
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:47,000
I sat and watched part of the Halo speedrun, which I like seeing people glitch through games.

1579
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:57,000
You have your time to donate right now and say if you want to save the frames or save the animals. Go for it.

1580
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:02,000
I think when we left, we were watching, they were just about to start Luigi's Mansion.

1581
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:09,000
And then right now, they should be doing Castlevania Symphony of the Night with no glitches.

1582
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:18,000
Oh, cool. Well, the good news is if you're listening to OLR and you're missing that, although I know a lot of you will bring that up as your video and then you're listening to us as audio, which is really cool if you're doing that.

1583
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:23,000
But everything is put on YouTube after the fact. So if you miss anything, you can always watch it later.

1584
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:32,000
Well, at 9 o'clock Pacific, they're going to be doing Wakamele Gold Edition 100% run and then Okami HD at 1030. So that's just today.

1585
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:40,000
Tomorrow, well, actually, I may stay up for this one because it'll be the 12 a.m. one. They're doing the 2014 Strider.

1586
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:47,000
Oh, cool. For an 80% finish run. And I would really love to see that one. So I think I'm going to stay up for that one.

1587
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:49,000
Man, I want to play the NES Strider again.

1588
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:53,000
3.04 a.m. is Super Adventure Island 2. There's some good ones on here. There's Actraiser at 4 a.m.

1589
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:57,000
Why are they doing some of these early in the morning? I don't know.

1590
01:58:58,000 --> 01:58:59,000
Yeah, they do some of the worst times.

1591
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:01,000
Sonic CD at 1.47 p.m. tomorrow.

1592
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:08,000
There's an ad over at Live.VogueNetwork.com says they have a donation incentive for which region soundtrack for the Sonic CD remaster run.

1593
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:10,000
Donating.

1594
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:12,000
Japan is winning by a landslide.

1595
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:14,000
It's because everyone has good taste.

1596
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:16,000
You better get in there before Bobby Black Wolf.

1597
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:18,000
Unless he wants to donate like $20,000.

1598
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:20,000
Hey, it's all towards a good cause.

1599
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,000
Just don't read your future tomorrow at 1030. Astol at 12.44 a.m.

1600
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:25,000
I love Astol.

1601
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:27,000
I love Astol. That's a good game.

1602
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:31,000
Other good ones, I Am Bread at 5.45 on the 4th of July.

1603
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:35,000
That's a good game. But I'd watch someone speedrun that thing. It's so frustrating though.

1604
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:42,000
Hollow Knight is happening also on the 4th. Pokemon Puzzle League. Pokemon HeartGold or SoulSilver.

1605
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:49,000
How do you speedrun Puzzle League? I guess the same way you speedrun Tetris. I guess you just have to be really good at it.

1606
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:56,000
Here we go. There are two on this one I'm super happy about. Silent Hill 2 at 9.19 on the 4th. Another reason to stay home.

1607
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
11 o'clock is Resident Evil Code Veronica X.

1608
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:07,000
I will say our pal Flaco Jones submits for PT every time and they haven't picked him yet but maybe next time. He's still working on it.

1609
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:13,000
3.07 a.m. is Alex Kidd in Shinobi World which has been a classic game.

1610
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:19,000
So yeah, there's a lot of good stuff on there and as mentioned in the previous section, Castlevania 3 Dracula's Curse.

1611
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:26,000
5.56 on the 5th. Rondo of Blood at 6.46. There's a lot of good games on here. I just need to not go to work.

1612
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:32,000
And you never know what you're going to see when you're watching Summer Games Done Quick or the Games Done Quick series.

1613
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:38,000
In fact, this was just shared just a little bit ago in our Discord. Our brand new Discord. Look, we're already integrating it into the show.

1614
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:48,000
Over in the Orange Lawns Radio channel over on Discord, Tigerclaw actually brought to our attention that during the Battletoads Any% run, a new record was set today.

1615
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:54,000
Two seconds shy of the previous record. So, there it is.

1616
02:00:54,000 --> 02:01:05,000
We're going to have just other games coming up. There's going to be Chrono Trigger, Any% with no wrong warp, A Link to the Past, doing all dungeons with no sword.

1617
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:10,000
There's just a really lot of good ones on here. Shantae is on here.

1618
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:17,000
I'm sorry, I do want to just clarify before somebody corrects me. This was actually not done as a part of Summer Games Done Quick. I apologize, I misunderstood.

1619
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:26,000
It just happened to be the same day that they're doing Summer Games Done Quick. You have other people that are doing fast games in tandem.

1620
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:37,000
But a new record was set today by TheMexicanRunner, is the name he goes by online, and he was also the guy who was on a quest to beat every NES game ever made.

1621
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:45,000
So, he just happened to do that today, which is why I assumed it was part of Summer Games Done Quick, but it was actually not, but still lots of speedrunning records being set.

1622
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:49,000
This one's for you. Super Metroid Low Percent Ice Race.

1623
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:51,000
Ice Race?

1624
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:53,000
Ice Race. I don't know what that is.

1625
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:55,000
Maybe they're only using the Ice Beam.

1626
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:57,000
I reckon. Interesting.

1627
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:01,000
But yeah, there's a lot of really good. Some of them I'm actually really surprised to see on here.

1628
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:08,000
But there's an Earthbound one for Any% with no glitch. And then the finale is called Anyone Still Awake?

1629
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:14,000
Anyone Still Awake? Yeah, really good. I may have this running on my second monitor.

1630
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
I always have to watch a Taskbot block, though.

1631
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:19,000
Good times.

1632
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:25,000
Alright, and hopefully everybody on the couch behaves themselves this year. I hope they all got a little training after what happened last year.

1633
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:27,000
Meanwhile, let's move on.

1634
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:29,000
I think that was still this year.

1635
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:31,000
That was the winner. Sorry, the winner.

1636
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:33,000
It feels like it was a year ago.

1637
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:35,000
I know, Trump.

1638
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:39,000
The world has gone to shit in such a little time.

1639
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:48,000
Meanwhile, let's talk about what is in stores this week. What can you find on shelves this week that you can work on speedrunning for the next awesome games done quick?

1640
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:50,000
Loki, how about in the US?

1641
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
Not a whole lot, but as we mentioned, That's You is going to be out on PlayStation 4.

1642
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:57,000
So if you have PlayStation Plus, which you probably do, you can get that for free.

1643
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:01,000
On 3DS, we have Kirby's Blowout Blast.

1644
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:08,000
And then on Accel World vs. Sword Art Online on PlayStation 4 and Vita.

1645
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:16,000
And Fable Fortune, their card game, that's coming out on Xbox One and on PC.

1646
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:28,000
And then, it's a bit of an early tease, but next, the week after that, one week from Tuesday, Final Fantasy XII, the Zodiac Age on PlayStation 4.

1647
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:32,000
I'm so excited about that, just to be clear.

1648
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:37,000
I'm excited to play Final Fantasy XII all over again, because you know, I haven't beaten it.

1649
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
I got a ways on it when it was originally on PlayStation 2.

1650
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:50,000
Actually, I've never played XII. I played the XII spinoff game that was on DS for a little bit, but I didn't play it that much.

1651
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:56,000
Alright, let's travel over to Japan and check out the releases over there, which on the PlayStation 4 this week on July the 6th,

1652
02:03:57,000 --> 02:04:01,000
Gundam Versus is out, as well as Omega Labyrinth Z in a regular and limited edition.

1653
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:05,000
Those are pretty much the big releases on the PlayStation 4 this week.

1654
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:13,000
The Vita is also getting Omega Labyrinth Z in a regular and limited edition, so Vita is still not being overlooked in Japan.

1655
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:20,000
The Switch doesn't really have anything coming out until July the 20th, so we have a few weeks of a break from the Switch.

1656
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:25,000
But checking out the 3DS, nah, nothing there either. We get Hey! Pikmin on the 13th.

1657
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:30,000
But as far as this week goes, it's still a little bit empty otherwise.

1658
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:32,000
How about the UK, DarkSakura?

1659
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:39,000
Oh, there's some stuff. We have, it would be great if I haven't lost my place. There we go.

1660
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:45,000
So we have on the 4th, Space Plan on, wait, that's May. Sorry.

1661
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
Because it wasn't linked to July.

1662
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:51,000
Well, excuse me, Princess.

1663
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:56,000
Alright, on the 5th we have Toby, The Secret Mine. That's it.

1664
02:04:57,000 --> 02:05:00,000
I guess it's a slow week this week.

1665
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
You think? July usually is.

1666
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:08,000
I suppose I can count the 9th because this is the next episode. Gorn for PC.

1667
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:11,000
Gorn? Gorn. What's Gorn?

1668
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:15,000
The Gorn, the release it. Something I won't play.

1669
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:19,000
Alright, the release dates are all Gorn.

1670
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:26,000
Moving on, let's get to the mailbag. Every week you guys send us emails to participate at orangelaundrader.com.

1671
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:31,000
Again, if you want to send an email to our show, participate at orangelaundrader.com is the place to send those emails.

1672
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:35,000
And every week we open up the email bag and pull out some of our favorite emails.

1673
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:40,000
And since I don't have my email music this week, I was missing it two weeks ago. It fell off my playlist.

1674
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,000
But you'll get replacement music tonight.

1675
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
It's our list list music. There it is.

1676
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:51,000
We only have one email.

1677
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
Alright, participate at orangelaundrader.com.

1678
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:58,000
Hi, OLR. It's your friendly neighborhood rage-inator yet again.

1679
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:04,000
Considering what's been going on this week in gaming, I thought I'd write in regarding to...

1680
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:09,000
Spell the word T-O. How hard is it to put two letters instead of the number two?

1681
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:11,000
Now everybody got a rant tonight.

1682
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
Three letters. T-W-O. Relevant topics.

1683
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:18,000
And the same goes for three. That's just improper grammar.

1684
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:22,000
As you three are probably well aware and may have mentioned earlier in the show,

1685
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
Nintendo has announced that we all...

1686
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:28,000
What we all expected that would do sooner or later.

1687
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:30,000
They're...

1688
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:37,000
Typos. They're giving the Super Nintendo the Mini Classic Edition re-release like they did with the NES.

1689
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:42,000
Now I won't regurgitate the details on that seeing as you probably did so well.

1690
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,000
And I... No. Did so already. Sorry.

1691
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
And I don't want to be redundant, but I will ask you this.

1692
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
Are you excited about it and considering picking it up?

1693
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:53,000
I've answered that.

1694
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
No, no, and yes.

1695
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:58,000
Picking up what again? Sorry, I missed...

1696
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:00,000
The SNES Classic.

1697
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:06,000
Well, I wouldn't say I'm a no. If Nintendo wants me to have one, I'll have one.

1698
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:10,000
And thank you, Slidekick, but I come for everybody's grammar.

1699
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:12,000
I come for you.

1700
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,000
Sneak into your room and cut up your wigs.

1701
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:20,000
Where was I?

1702
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
I'll pick up the SNES Classic Edition if I can.

1703
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:29,000
In terms of favorite memories, it's a toss-up between buying the system completely on my own with my own funds, a gaming first for me,

1704
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:36,000
being introduced to the fighting genre on the system with games like Killer Instinct, Primal Rage, and the Mortal Kombat Street Fighter series,

1705
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:41,000
and also getting my first gaming soundtrack as a pack-in, the Killer Instinct soundtrack.

1706
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:47,000
I played the crap out of it and that started my obsession with building my library of game OSTs.

1707
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:51,000
The first system that I bought with my own money was a Super Nintendo,

1708
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:58,000
and my boyfriend at the time got me a Super Street Fighter II Turbo,

1709
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:02,000
and that made me very happy because I really liked Cammy's music.

1710
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:07,000
And I bought Kirby's Avalanche on my own, and I still have that same copy of Kirby's Avalanche.

1711
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:09,000
So, just saying.

1712
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
I thought I answered this on a previous show, but I'll say it quickly again.

1713
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:17,000
I got $200 for my parents for Christmas one year, and I turned right around and I got a PlayStation,

1714
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
and a copy of Crash Bandicoot 2.

1715
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,000
I think I had to sell some other stuff or something to make the whole money, or I had some other money saved,

1716
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:25,000
because that doesn't seem like enough money.

1717
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:31,000
But that was what I bought, and my mom was so pissed that that's what I spent the money on that I never got cash again for the Christmas.

1718
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:33,000
I love the chat room right now.

1719
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:35,000
Why?

1720
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
Because Come and Come Shoes told Slikik, Dark Sacred Shade comes from reading.

1721
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:42,000
And then Slikik says, Reading came first. Reading is the real art form.

1722
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:44,000
I will read a bitch.

1723
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:46,000
Well, how about you read the email?

1724
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:48,000
How about I read you for that hat?

1725
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:51,000
I love this hat.

1726
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:55,000
This hat was on television, almost, in a deleted scene.

1727
02:08:56,000 --> 02:09:00,000
This hat, this show, RuPaul's Drag Race, that you always quote, this hat was in a deleted scene.

1728
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
I have to say that you were looking quite scholarly with your...

1729
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:05,000
Do you like the glasses?

1730
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:07,000
...with your Newsboy cap and glasses.

1731
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:09,000
That's the only thing I'm going to do. Actually, I think...

1732
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
He's testing out Twitch stream outfits.

1733
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:14,000
No, it's not that. I think I'm going to shave my head.

1734
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:16,000
Don't do it. Don't do it.

1735
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:18,000
You don't want me to do it?

1736
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:20,000
No, don't do it. You need something on the side.

1737
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:22,000
You really?

1738
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:24,000
Yeah. Don't do it.

1739
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:26,000
Just when I thought I was going to do it, now you're having me having second thoughts.

1740
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:28,000
No, because the shave head thing is just like...

1741
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,000
There's like nothing left up top. It's got to go.

1742
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
You're not so fuzzless on the top.

1743
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:36,000
Don't do it yet.

1744
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:37,000
Or get like surgery.

1745
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:41,000
Just for you. No, no. First off. First off.

1746
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:43,000
Joking.

1747
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:47,000
No to chemicals, drugs, surgery. No.

1748
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:52,000
This is the way Mother Nature made me and if you don't like it, kiss my big fat ass.

1749
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:56,000
Although they do say that it actually does pass down from the maternal genes.

1750
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:58,000
Yeah, they're all bald on that side of the family.

1751
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:00,000
Yeah, so that's why I'm not having kids.

1752
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:02,000
Alright, anyway.

1753
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:06,000
Anyway, don't shave your head for at least a year.

1754
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:08,000
I'll think about it.

1755
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:12,000
As for my second subject, and you can probably guess what it is.

1756
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:20,000
DEALS! As opposed to what you already know, the Steam Summer Sale, aka the Shut Up and Take My Money Gavin Fortnite is well underway.

1757
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:26,000
I asked you this. Did you look over the sale? Yes, and I bought exactly two things.

1758
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:28,000
And one of them wasn't on sale.

1759
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:30,000
Actually I bought three things.

1760
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:34,000
I bought a Steam Link this time, and I need to talk to you about how you have your setup, Rob.

1761
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,000
Because yours doesn't have a lag, does it?

1762
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:39,000
No.

1763
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:41,000
Okay, I need to ask you how you have your setup.

1764
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:43,000
Wired. Wired. Okay.

1765
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:45,000
To the TV, right?

1766
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
Mm-hmm. But you stream Wi-Fi?

1767
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:50,000
No, I stream through a wired connection.

1768
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:53,000
You stream through a wired connection? Okay. Alright.

1769
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:59,000
Where was I? What are your thoughts on it? It's a fucking Steam Sale.

1770
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:11,000
Did you pick up any goodies for yourselves, and what? I got Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2, I bought Danganronpa Ultra Despair Girls, and I got a Steam Link. There you go.

1771
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:18,000
Not yet for me, but I probably will have a couple games by the time this is all said and done.

1772
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:23,000
But if you want to go look at my wishlist and buy me a belated birthday gift, I certainly am not going to complain.

1773
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:25,000
I ordered you pencils. Yay!

1774
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
But they're arriving at my house instead of your house.

1775
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:53,000
I did participate in the sale myself, and this may come as a shock to everyone, but I bought six items for roughly $23, two of the newer Pinball Ethics 2 Table DLCs that I was missing, completing my collection now, Burn Zombie Burn, Rainbow Six Vegas 2, Euro Trek Simulator 2, and Serious Sam 3, Jewel of the Nile DLC. In closing, remember to reject false orange bigoted dumbass icons.

1776
02:11:54,000 --> 02:12:12,000
And I apologize for the Google chat sound that went off while she was reading that email. Why is it, like, I will open that window for like 30 seconds during a show, because I'm trying to check something, and that happens to be the exact 30 second window that I'll get a message. Like, without fucking fail. Sorry guys.

1777
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,000
That happened on Reading is Fundamental a lot when I was...

1778
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:17,000
What about Loki? Did you buy anything?

1779
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:34,000
Um, the only thing I bought was Middle Earth Shadow of Mordor, but I... I don't know, maybe I flin hook, that looks pretty sweet. I don't know. There's other games out there, but I'm like, if I'm going to do this game jam, I don't want to be buying new games to play, because that's not...

1780
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:41,000
You need to do a game to put on the Steam store for the next sale. You can do it, Loki.

1781
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:45,000
Well, if I'm going to make the game I'm making now, it's not going on the Steam store, I don't think.

1782
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:47,000
Right, itch.io then.

1783
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:55,000
What if there was, like, one based off of Shadow of Mordor, except it was Game of Thrones theme, and it could be Shadow of Hodor?

1784
02:12:56,000 --> 02:13:06,000
Hey, just don't get sued over it, because if you want to know somebody who's a bigger dick than Nintendo when it comes to properties and licenses, try HBO.

1785
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:08,000
Just saying.

1786
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:15,000
Alright, come on gumshoos and chat says, Loki's game should just be a rant meter. Could be, maybe.

1787
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:24,000
It should be a clicky game called It's Not Loud Enough, and you keep clicking to turn up the volume, and it's never loud enough.

1788
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:39,000
Well, just like the original case, since this is not the premise I'm going to be using, the original premise for my clicker game was going to be kind of a cross between a clicker game, work time fun, and WarioWare.

1789
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:51,000
So, it was going to be... I don't even know what the purpose was yet, that's the problem, I didn't have a storyline to go along with it, so I didn't want to string a bunch of random shit together.

1790
02:13:51,000 --> 02:14:00,000
So, it was supposed to be like, you're earning money for some reason, it's like a late night TV thing, and each channel is a different job you're doing.

1791
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:14,000
It's really stupid shit, like liking a video on YouTube, like you keep clicking the like button, you know, because they always say smash that like button, so you're smashing that like button, or you're burping a baby, or something that involves...

1792
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:22,000
Okay, the story, here's your story, the story could be that you're unemployed, and so you're taking every odd job you possibly can, like you're driving for Lyft...

1793
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:28,000
It was supposed to be like Fiverr, like a Fiverr type thing where you're doing a bunch of weird shit.

1794
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:32,000
What's that fucking Amazon thing that you can get like 2 cents for taking a survey?

1795
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:34,000
The Turk?

1796
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:39,000
Yeah, that whole thing. There's that. That's what you could base it off of.

1797
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:48,000
That's what it was supposed to be like, but instead it's, I'm doing something totally different from all that, that I think sounds cool. We'll see.

1798
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:53,000
Bobby Blackwell says you should do it where you're playing multiple clicker games at once and call it multi-clicking.

1799
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:55,000
This sounds very familiar.

1800
02:14:56,000 --> 02:15:01,000
Here is another one, another one that was hilarious, and this would be the whole joke because I never finished a game.

1801
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:10,000
The whole game was going to be about making clicker games, or like adding features to it, and you know how you ascend in the game? You ascend by playing another clicker game.

1802
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:14,000
You keep going deeper with it, so you're playing a clicker game within a clicker game within a clicker game.

1803
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:16,000
Or you ascend to scrap your project and start again.

1804
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:23,000
You're just like, well I'm just going to play this instead, and then you're playing another clicker game that's about making clicker games, and it just keeps getting deeper and deeper.

1805
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:31,000
And that was another idea I had, but I didn't run with it. But no, I'm going to try this one first, the one I have that I haven't mentioned anything about, because it's different.

1806
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:36,000
And it could be cool, but if not, then maybe I'll go back to some weird shit like that.

1807
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:39,000
Click recursions. Start, Tetsuya.

1808
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:44,000
Alright, anything else for the email, Dara Sakura? Was that it from Rage Nator, or was there more?

1809
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:46,000
That was it.

1810
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:53,000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you would like to send us an email for a future week.

1811
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:55,000
There you go.

1812
02:15:56,000 --> 02:16:01,000
Please send us emails. Make Dara Sakura work around here. She gets chocolate after all.

1813
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:03,000
I already work.

1814
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:05,000
Loki, let's move on to some more news.

1815
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:14,000
Alright, so one of the other games I was thinking about actually picking up on Steam because I've been watching, oh god I don't remember the guy's name now.

1816
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:25,000
Air Force, I think it's Air Force Proud 95. It's a guy who does a lot of trolling streams in Flight Simulator X. That was the one I was going to look at.

1817
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:30,000
Anyways, so let's talk a little bit about one of my favorite games, Grand Theft Auto.

1818
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:42,000
And as you remember, there was a whole controversy with modding tools, the fact that OpenIV got a cease and desist, and a big backlash regarding it.

1819
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:51,000
Well, there's been an update to that. So Rockstar Games has added a new page to their support site, basically talking about single player mods.

1820
02:16:52,000 --> 02:17:08,000
So they're saying, are single PC mods allowed? And it says, after discussion with Take-Two has agreed that it generally will not take legal action against third parties involved in Rockstar PC games.

1821
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:22,000
They are single player, non-commercial, with respect to IP rights of third parties. And this does not apply to multiplayer online services, tools, files, libraries, or functions that could be used to impact multiplayer online services.

1822
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:33,000
Or use of importation of other IP, including other Rockstar IP in the project. This is not a license and it does not constitute endorsement, approval, or authorization of any third party project.

1823
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:39,000
Take-Two reserves the right to object to any third party project, revise, revoke, blah, blah, blah.

1824
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:47,000
So it sounds like they're kind of saying, no, no, PC mods are still okay, single player mods are fine.

1825
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:52,000
And I don't remember if it's a part of this, but I've watched a lot of live streams regarding this.

1826
02:17:53,000 --> 02:18:00,000
And people are a little bit more in the know that I think they're actually in contact with the OpenIV guys to see if that can get back.

1827
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:07,000
Basically saying, listen, as long as you don't do anything with online, you guys are still okay to bring that back.

1828
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
So we'll see if that's the case.

1829
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:19,000
Because there's a lot of cool shit you can do with it. I've been watching a lot of different streams where they have different scripting mods and stuff that look pretty fantastic.

1830
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:35,000
One of the awesome things that you can do with OpenIV, and I didn't even realize this, they have as part of the OpenIV package, not only can you use it to change the models in game and stuff like that to mod things to look differently,

1831
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:45,000
but they have a thing called Open Camera, which is actually a mod to the whole Rockstar editor, so you can use it for filming different things.

1832
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:50,000
You're not constrained to the stuff that you have in that editor. You can actually do more of a free cam with it.

1833
02:18:51,000 --> 02:19:00,000
And with that, one of the things I watched actually today is this movie that they made. It's a short film filmed entirely within Grand Theft Auto V.

1834
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:07,000
And it was called Not Normal or something like that. It's fucking amazing.

1835
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:16,000
It's absolutely amazing what you can do with this editor. That wouldn't be possible with this kind of ban on this stuff.

1836
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:26,000
So I think that they realize that there's a lot of creativity that you can do here, but at the same time, they have to protect their money online, and I don't think people are really opposed to that.

1837
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:32,000
So go after the people making cheat devices for online and let OpenIV exist.

1838
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:42,000
All right. And then along with that, speaking of mods and stuff, so one of the things that people do with any game, including Grand Theft Auto V, is dig through the code.

1839
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:53,000
So apparently some people found in the Gunrunning update, which is the latest update they did for GTA Online, that there's a series of code related to the whole

1840
02:19:53,000 --> 02:20:08,000
Zancudo military base and UFO crashing. Because remember, everybody's been looking for this hidden Easter egg thing that's about UFOs and stuff in Grand Theft Auto because there's been all these hints towards it, but never really anything coming to fruition.

1841
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:24,000
Well apparently though, there is a supply mission that there's some way to trigger it, and it may not be something that's available right now, but they have filmed it triggering, where a UFO crashes and you go capture an alien egg from it.

1842
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:44,000
So because it's not finished yet, it's something that may be released later on, and they're not entirely sure what you have to do to trigger the mission. Apparently it's very rare, but it is something that is in the game, so it's kind of neat to see something related to the whole Chiliad Mystery stuff.

1843
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:49,000
It's always fun to dig through files and find little secrets.

1844
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:51,000
Yeah.

1845
02:20:51,000 --> 02:21:03,000
Alright, well let's move on to talk about Overwatch and secrets that people are finding on the PTR, although I guess they're not really secret if they are being publicly tested, but there are going to be some big changes coming to Overwatch.

1846
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:13,000
There's going to be a new recently captured tab in the highlights menu, so you can actually bind a key to record up to 32 of your own highlights, so that's kind of neat.

1847
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:29,000
What will happen on consoles, you can take those clips and download them to the system's native media library, but on PC you can then download them and output them in 4K 60 frames a second on any computer, regardless of the specs. I think that's very smart.

1848
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:30,000
That's pretty sweet.

1849
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:35,000
That's very similar to what Mario Kart 8 does on Wii U, so strangely enough not on the Switch.

1850
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:48,000
Actually going back to the whole Rockstar Editor thing, that's what you can do with that too. If your PC is just kind of ehhh, because it's rendering it later on, it's not in real time, they can do it at much higher resolution than you can do.

1851
02:21:48,000 --> 02:22:01,000
Exactly, so that Mario Kart TV thing is doing in Mario Kart is it's rendering it, basically not in real, it's rendering it on demand, so everything kind of looks really good in those replays and so forth, and the real nuances that you see.

1852
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:10,000
I'll remember Angry Luigi, that whole meme from a couple years ago, right? That was all from the rendering that it does in the game after the fact. So the fact that that's coming to Overwatch, that's going to be awesome.

1853
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:30,000
And it always surprised me that that was not a feature you could use for play of the games right out the gate. I was always surprised Blizzard didn't have a way to natively dump those clips. People were using screen recorders and filming it with cell phones and also the garbage, so the fact that they're doing the native exports I think is going to be a really good thing for their game, so that's really smart.

1854
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:43,000
Also, and going to our chat over at live.vognetware.com, come on gumshoes and chat says, nice, I really wish I could go back and see some of my play of the match clips, better than earning an achievement, you know, sometimes for sure.

1855
02:22:43,000 --> 02:23:01,000
Anyway, also with this, loot boxes are going to get some improvement. The rate of duplicates will be drastically reduced. To compensate for this, the lack of currency that would be generated from lack of duplicates, the overall amount of credits that you'll get from loot boxes will increase.

1856
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:25,000
I'm happy to hear the amount of duplicates that's going down. I'll never forget that time during the Uprising event, I opened a loot box on PlayStation 4 and I got the awesome D.Va intro, which is great, but I got that D.Va intro, the selfie one where the mech explodes behind her, I got that twice in one box. That's a bit much, don't you think?

1857
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:37,000
To get the same thing twice in a box, so I mean, don't get me wrong, I was ecstatic to get that intro, but that might have been a bit much, so excited to hear about that change. DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

1858
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:59,000
Well, we're going to have a new fighting game playable at EVO this year. There will be the new fighting game out by Arika, and it is featuring Street Fighter EX characters, Garuda, Kairi, and Hokuto, that was listed in the footage.

1859
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:15,000
As we know, Arika did the Street Fighter EX series, which it would be nice, actually, if we got another EX series, that would be really good, but they are teasing it as something for a project.

1860
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:22,000
It was actually first brought out on April Fool's, so they thought it was a joke. People thought it was a joke, but it actually is happening.

1861
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:39,000
So, for other fighters that are going to be there, it's Gundam vs. Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite, the city of Final Fantasy NT, and Dragon Ball FighterZ, the Trunks build or later. So, there you go, it's in two weeks.

1862
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:42,000
Are you going to check it out?

1863
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:46,000
Well, yeah, I'm more interested in the Dragon Ball fighting game though.

1864
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,000
But there's room in your-

1865
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
I like EX, I want Skull-a-mania to come back.

1866
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:53,000
There's room in your heart for more than one fighting game, I'm sure.

1867
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:57,000
I love Skull-a-mania, and Hokuto, those are like my two.

1868
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:59,000
Act Efton Chat says, Evo's going to be awesome.

1869
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:01,000
I'm sure a lot of people are looking forward to it.

1870
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:05,000
Someone wants to send me a ticket to Vegas. I'll go cover it for OR.

1871
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:12,000
Just a few more stories here, and then we're going to get to our Skype line, if you want to call and talk about Evo, or really anything at all.

1872
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:17,000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, we'll get there in just a moment, but first, Loki.

1873
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:23,000
I don't know what to say about this. It's definitely an interesting time to be alive.

1874
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:29,000
Tecmo is making a version of Dead or Alive that you can smell.

1875
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:33,000
That's right, they're calling it, and not just Dead or Alive.

1876
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:39,000
Dead or Alive Extreme, like as an extreme, extremely fan service.

1877
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:41,000
Smell what?

1878
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:43,000
I don't know, but Dead or Alive-

1879
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:44,000
The beach?

1880
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:45,000
It's coming to their, I guess-

1881
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:46,000
Coconut Oil?

1882
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:49,000
Their VR Sense platform, which is an arcade game.

1883
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:59,000
So the arcade cabinet, actually, that this game runs on, has different sensory functions like hot, cold, wind, mist, and smell.

1884
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:06,000
Just what we need arcades to smell like, is Dead or Alive.

1885
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:11,000
It smells like sex and candy in here.

1886
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:16,000
Oh my god, that song from the 90's is relevant again, I can't believe it.

1887
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:23,000
Marcy Playground never thought they'd be collecting residuals in 2017.

1888
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:26,000
Dear lord, that song is terrible.

1889
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:29,000
So I'm guessing that, I don't know, I don't-

1890
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:32,000
Lots of coconut oil, I'm guessing, right?

1891
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:33,000
No, lots of coke.

1892
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:34,000
Or pussy? I don't know-

1893
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,000
You know, wait a minute-

1894
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
Is that not what I'm supposed to infer?

1895
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:39,000
If someone's serving fish-

1896
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:45,000
If they're gonna give you the full strip club experience, then I say that they spray glitter on your face.

1897
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:50,000
Because, you know, if you're gonna smell like a strip club, at least you have the sparkly glitter that goes along with it.

1898
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:55,000
You win, and then the game just sprays you with glitter.

1899
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:58,000
I'm just now remembering your story about the strip club.

1900
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,000
Oh, when I went to the strip club and got a lap dance?

1901
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:01,000
Yeah.

1902
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:06,000
Because my friends were like, you know, obviously I was, well I've been totally gay my whole life,

1903
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:12,000
but, you know, in my early 20s it was like, I guess it was like a thing for my friends to take the gay guy to a strip club.

1904
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:15,000
And they said, which one do you think is the hottest?

1905
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:19,000
And I said, and I quote, that one because she looks like Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

1906
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:22,000
Which is true, she looked a lot like Sarah Michelle Gellar.

1907
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:28,000
So of course my friend bought me a lap dance and it was really awkward and everything, and I felt sorry for the girl.

1908
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:30,000
Did you tell her that she looked like Buffy?

1909
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:34,000
I don't remember if I ended up telling her that I picked her because she looked like Buffy,

1910
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:42,000
but I did, she did at the end, she was like, you don't, she could tell I did not, I was not responding to her, right?

1911
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:45,000
So she was like, what's wrong? Relax. Are you okay?

1912
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:49,000
And I was like, uh, honey, I'm gay. And she said, oh, I thought so.

1913
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:53,000
And she sat down next to me and she just, and she's like, oh, my roommate's gay.

1914
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:55,000
He's my best friend in the whole world.

1915
02:27:55,000 --> 02:28:01,000
And she's telling me her life story and all I can think of is like, please put your shirt back on because this is really awkward right now.

1916
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:05,000
Did you really want me to tell that story on OLR? Because you got me to tell that story on OLR.

1917
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:07,000
You got me to tell that story on OLR.

1918
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:08,000
You've said it on OLR before.

1919
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:09,000
Have I?

1920
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:10,000
Yes.

1921
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:14,000
I think it's been a long time. Those are the types of stories I don't like to tell on OLR.

1922
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:19,000
Nobody knows to hear about the time when Rob Roberts got boobies in his face. Nobody needs to hear that story.

1923
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:22,000
Wait, you know, there is always the 16th anniversary show.

1924
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:27,000
Where we go have it at city limits.

1925
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:29,000
Is anyone still there?

1926
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:30,000
I think it is.

1927
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:35,000
What was, what is the, I think it's still as showgirls. Is that the name of it?

1928
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:36,000
Showgirls is still there.

1929
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:38,000
That was City Limits.

1930
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:40,000
No, City Limits is a different place.

1931
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,000
I thought St. Limits was the one off Auburn that's down there.

1932
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:43,000
I don't know.

1933
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:46,000
Showgirls I know is still there because they drive past it as I go to the Togo's over there all the time.

1934
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,000
I would just go for the food.

1935
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:52,000
Well, so here's the thing. So here's the thing. So obviously the non-locals have no idea what we're talking about.

1936
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:59,000
In California, the law is we have juice bars because there's laws. Are they city laws or state laws? I think they're state laws.

1937
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:05,000
The state law is that you cannot have alcohol and titties. Or is it full nudity? It's beaver.

1938
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:06,000
It's full nudity.

1939
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:14,000
So you can't have that and alcohol in the same place. So that's why you have juice bars. You can get juice and...

1940
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:15,000
Or soda, yeah.

1941
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:20,000
Or soda or mozzarella sticks, which I want to say, Logie, when I told you that story, I think, didn't you?

1942
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:24,000
I swear you were the one that said, oh yeah, they got great mozzarella sticks.

1943
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:30,000
However, mozzarella sticks and strip clubs, it doesn't, you don't want to like...

1944
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:35,000
Only Logie would be like, oh yeah, that strip club's got great mozzarella sticks.

1945
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:36,000
I was hungry.

1946
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,000
Fried cheese and boobs.

1947
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:42,000
What's not to like?

1948
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,000
Doesn't that sound like a party to our Sakura?

1949
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:47,000
I don't know. I'm kind of not into any of that.

1950
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:51,000
The fried cheese is a whole hell lot cheaper than the boobs, that's for sure.

1951
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:53,000
Moving on.

1952
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:59,000
Can we please talk about video games, please? It's been 15 goddamn years.

1953
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:02,000
Can I talk about a fucking video game?

1954
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,000
I wrecked them.

1955
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:06,000
Wrecked them? I hardly knew them.

1956
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:10,000
All right, Mega Man 4 is the last game I want to talk about tonight.

1957
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:15,000
You know, classic video game. When was it? 1991 or 92 when that game came out?

1958
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:22,000
Well, here's the thing. Apparently in that game there was supposed to be a mini-boss in Pharaoh Man's stage.

1959
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:25,000
But that boss never made it into the game.

1960
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:31,000
You could see this boss in an episode of, or an episode, an issue of EGM back in 1991,

1961
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:35,000
but hence that mini-boss never actually made it into the game.

1962
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:39,000
Well, get this, there's a YouTube that came out this week and it's around the different gaming blogs,

1963
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:43,000
and you can finally see that boss in motion.

1964
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:46,000
Now, usually this wouldn't be such a big deal,

1965
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:53,000
but I kind of like these stories about, like, unearthed things in video games like 20 years after the fact.

1966
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:57,000
Kind of related to your Grand Theft Auto alien thing, although that's a little more current,

1967
02:30:57,000 --> 02:31:00,000
but I like this whole, like, digging into games to find this.

1968
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:03,000
And to be fair, this was not digging it. Nobody dug into the Mega Man code.

1969
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:08,000
Somebody found, like, an old video footage of somebody playing this at, like, an expo or something like that.

1970
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:11,000
So, you know, it was just, it was unearthed in video footage.

1971
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:18,000
But, with all the talk about Star Fox 2 coming back, you know, that was promoted in magazines and all this stuff.

1972
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:23,000
But, outside of a 90% finished ROM, nobody's ever really got to play Star Fox 2.

1973
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:27,000
So, I think it's kind of cool that a lot of these old video game history things are being unearthed.

1974
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:30,000
So, I just think that's kind of neat.

1975
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:33,000
So, anyway, Dartitsian Chat says,

1976
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:35,000
I highly recommend watching this video series.

1977
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:41,000
You get to see the behind-the-scenes watching the guys at EGM setting up to get screenshots for the magazine.

1978
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:44,000
Yeah, you can actually see them setting up to take a picture and all that good stuff.

1979
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:45,000
So, you can check that out.

1980
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:47,000
What is the YouTube user that actually did this together?

1981
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:49,000
I see the YouTube here. Let me actually go to YouTube.

1982
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:52,000
God, this is a 54-minute clip.

1983
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:57,000
Robert Hoskin is the individual's name over on YouTube, so you can check that out.

1984
02:31:57,000 --> 02:32:01,000
Very cool. All right, that's going to do it for the stories that we have slotted tonight.

1985
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:04,000
But we're going to open up the Skype line if you have a little more to say.

1986
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:08,000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype if you want to give us a call.

1987
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:13,000
Meanwhile, I'll check in with Loki while we're waiting for a call to see if we have any last-minute stories, Loki.

1988
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:16,000
Apparently, I can't spell normal with one hand here.

1989
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:19,000
Okay, thank you for minimizing that window.

1990
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:27,000
I was posting a link in the chat for that not normal short film that was done in Grand Theft Auto because they have it on Vimeo.

1991
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:32,000
And they also have the behind-the-scenes port, too, where the guy talks about making it and everything, which is pretty interesting.

1992
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:35,000
So, definitely go watch that. But a really good thing.

1993
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:44,000
Last-minute stories. This is something that's kind of interesting. I'm not sure who to blame for this.

1994
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:48,000
But apparently, they uploaded the 4K footage from that whole...

1995
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:55,000
Oh, what was that? What was the EA game that you guys don't like because Mass Effect was...?

1996
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:56,000
Anthem.

1997
02:32:56,000 --> 02:33:04,000
Anthem. Yeah, so they uploaded 4K footage of Anthem that was supposedly the PS4 version that they were showing off or whatever.

1998
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:11,000
And apparently, it looked like they just pasted PlayStation 4 button prompts over Xbox One button prompts.

1999
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:13,000
That's kind of funny. I don't know why.

2000
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:17,000
So the thought was, oh, this is Xbox One X footage or something like that.

2001
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:22,000
I think it's still running off PC, but who knows? It's interesting, though.

2002
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:29,000
I remember way back. My very first E3 was the year they were... I think they were showing off the 360 for the first time.

2003
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:36,000
Or maybe that was the second year. I don't know, but I remember in the cabinets were PCs that were playing the 360 games.

2004
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,000
Yeah, the dev kits were just PCs.

2005
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:41,000
It's not uncommon in the gaming world. There's nothing wrong with it.

2006
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:49,000
Yeah, but if you're going to upload 4K footage, maybe reshoot that or edit that out or something.

2007
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:53,000
Instead of just... whoops.

2008
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:58,000
Again, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype if you want to give us a call.

2009
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:00,000
Looks like people are being shy tonight.

2010
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:07,000
But I also know it's a long weekend, so a lot of people went on vacation and stuff, so we probably don't have quite the same turnout we would usually have.

2011
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:11,000
But we were already off last week. We don't want to miss two weeks in a row.

2012
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:15,000
A YouTube series I could recommend. I started watching this because somebody recommended it to me.

2013
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:20,000
There's a Final Fantasy XIV documentary out there, and I can't remember the name of the YouTube user.

2014
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:23,000
Maybe somebody in chat will know what I'm talking about.

2015
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:29,000
But it's a whole documentary about the 1.0 and why it was kind of rushed the way it was.

2016
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:31,000
And they actually talked to some of the developers on the game and all that.

2017
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:39,000
So it kind of talks about the death of 1.0 or actually the fact that they were running 1.0 while they were still making 2.0, essentially.

2018
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:47,000
So it was like they were creating this new game but maintaining the old game that they knew they were going to pull the plug on the whole time they were doing it.

2019
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:49,000
This is very interesting to me.

2020
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:51,000
When's XI coming out of mobile already?

2021
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:53,000
That has kind of disappeared, hasn't it?

2022
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:55,000
They didn't say anything about it at E3 or anything like that.

2023
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:58,000
So, it was weird.

2024
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:01,000
Alright, last call for calls. Get in now or don't get in at all.

2025
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:04,000
They have a new Final Fantasy XV mobile game.

2026
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:07,000
I gotta admit, there's a brand new one that just came out.

2027
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:11,000
Yeah, they're all reskins. I swear to God, I've played a lot of these.

2028
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:15,000
They're all reskins of each other. There's really only two or three mobile games out there.

2029
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:17,000
We have a good friend that worked on it.

2030
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:20,000
We should get somebody on the show to talk about it then, hopefully.

2031
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:24,000
If they can. Sometimes they're all gag orders and stuff, but anyway.

2032
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:27,000
They're all reskins.

2033
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:33,000
Well, I know there's a lot out there where they take a popular game and they'll kind of put the property on it.

2034
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:38,000
Endless Runners. What was the frickin'? They did one for Temple Run.

2035
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:42,000
That was a big game. I don't think that game is that big anymore, but they did a Brave.

2036
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:44,000
Disney had a Brave. It was just Temple Run.

2037
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:50,000
So, sometimes Angry Birds, Star Wars Angry Birds, and they have the whole Rio Angry Birds thing.

2038
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:58,000
Alright, well, it doesn't look like people are calling in, so I guess we're gonna wrap up the show.

2039
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:00,000
That's gonna do it for another episode of Orange Lawn Radio.

2040
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:05,000
Alright, you shy people. At least you can head on over to the Discord and you can talk to us there on Discord.

2041
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:10,000
Leave us some messages. Also, you can always leave us an email any time throughout the week.

2042
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:13,000
Participate at OrangeLawnRadio.com or you can always tweet us.

2043
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:17,000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R. Sorry I don't always get around to reading those on air

2044
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:22,000
just because I have so many windows open when I'm trying to do the show, but I promise I do read all the tweets.

2045
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:27,000
If you send something for Jamie or Matt, I will always forward it as appropriate.

2046
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:31,000
But for now, it's time for us to wrap up the show and get on out of here.

2047
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:35,000
Thank you guys for tuning in tonight. I hope you guys had a fun time on the show tonight.

2048
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:37,000
We'll be back to do it again in seven days.

2049
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:40,000
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lawn Radio, please tell a friend or two about the show.

2050
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:43,000
Help us spread the word. We are the show where every gamer has a voice,

2051
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:48,000
but we can only put those voices out there if they're here to share in the show with us.

2052
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:54,000
So, a nice five-star review on iTunes or Google Play or wherever it is you found this show.

2053
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:56,000
That goes a long way as well.

2054
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:59,000
So, let's go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.

2055
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:05,000
I'll start. My final thought for the night is I need to play some more Overwatch.

2056
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:09,000
I haven't played in like a few weeks. I'm feeling the itch to play some Overwatch,

2057
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:12,000
but darn that Final Fantasy expansion taking all my time.

2058
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:15,000
Jamie, I'll let you go next. Your final thoughts tonight?

2059
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:19,000
I'm going to go home and play more of the screaming game.

2060
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:21,000
I'm sorry, Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2.

2061
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:23,000
It's over 9000!

2062
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:31,000
You know what? I tried to play it in English, and the good voice actors, don't get me wrong,

2063
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:36,000
but when you have started with the series, hearing a particular series of voices,

2064
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:40,000
it's really hard to go to anything else. You know?

2065
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:43,000
Alright. Loki, your final thought tonight?

2066
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:48,000
I guess I'm going to work on my game this week. The new game, apparently.

2067
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:51,000
I guess. Maybe.

2068
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:55,000
Alright. Hopefully. I hope you actually get it done.

2069
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:57,000
Me too.

2070
02:37:57,000 --> 02:38:00,000
Alright, we are going to do it for another episode.

2071
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:04,000
That's it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio. We'll see you in seven days.

2072
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:08,000
We'll do it all over again. Have a great week gaming. Enjoy the new stuff that's out this week,

2073
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:14,000
and we will see you very soon next week with another edition of Orange Lounge Radio.

2074
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:15,000
