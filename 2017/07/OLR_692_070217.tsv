7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	19000	Tonight, Pokemon Go gets a gym makeover, but is it enough to get everyone interested in the game again?
19000	24000	And will everyone be interested in a Nintendo GameCube party game being released on Nintendo Switch later this month?
24000	27000	We find out tonight on the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	37000	Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37000	46000	It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 692 for this July the 2nd of 2017.
46000	55000	My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E, joining me here in studio N7 based out of Sacramento, California.
55000	58000	Please say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
58000	64000	Welcome. You doing okay over there? You sound like an evil supervillain plotting.
64000	65000	I feel really good right now.
65000	66000	Why is that?
66000	67000	Because you brought me chocolate.
67000	71000	I did. I brought her back chocolate from Chicago, which is what she wanted.
71000	72000	I don't know how to pronounce this place.
72000	77000	She was kitty sitting, so I said she could have anything she wanted, so of course she wanted chocolate.
77000	82000	I think it's Vosges Hot Chocolate. I don't know. It's something...
82000	88000	But I have heard of this place, like, for the last year or so, for longer than that.
88000	91000	I was like, you know what? I have to have chocolate from this place.
91000	94000	So I was like, I have one request.
94000	95000	There it is.
95000	96000	And it is the orgasm of chocolate.
96000	98000	Well, we found one. They had one on the...
98000	104000	I want to say the Miracle Mile, the Magic Mile, I think is what it's called in Chicago, where all the big stores are.
104000	106000	We actually went to a Uniqlo store that sold...
106000	108000	They have Nintendo shirts right now, and I didn't...
108000	111000	I've never been in one of those stores, but that was something Alan was looking at.
111000	115000	So I actually got a shirt that's just a giant Mario sprite, but it's like red.
115000	117000	I kind of... Yeah, it's really cool.
117000	119000	So, you know, did some shopping in Chicago.
119000	125000	So, real quick, I had a great time in Chicago, and yeah, that city's always very good to me.
125000	127000	Had a great time at the Pride event there.
127000	129000	How was San Francisco? You did San Francisco Pride the week we were off, right?
129000	131000	It's very weird walking in a cast.
131000	133000	Oh, did you actually get to march in the parade?
133000	134000	I didn't march.
134000	135000	Oh, okay. Well, I thought you did.
135000	136000	Because I couldn't do that.
136000	143000	It was basically a lot of standing around, but I got to meet a few other of the local Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, which was great.
143000	144000	Awesome.
144000	147000	And then... But after a while, it was like too many people, just way too many people.
147000	150000	So we ended up going to Japantown instead.
150000	151000	Oh, fun.
151000	152000	And JD was with us.
152000	154000	Yeah, as I say, our pal JD lives in that area.
154000	155000	He hung out with us for most of the time.
155000	156000	Yeah, great.
156000	164000	And we met up with my friend Liz and her wife Skirt, who I'd never met her wife before, so it was a great meeting.
164000	170000	We hung around, we went to Kino Kunia, and of course I found a Danganronpa V3 book.
170000	172000	So I had to say, Shane, do you want this?
172000	175000	We've already left the store, so then I get, is it this, is it this?
175000	176000	I bet there's a spoiler on it.
176000	178000	I do want it, tell JD to get it for me.
178000	180000	And I was like, I'm not walking the fuck back there.
180000	185000	Just so you know, he officially got the book yesterday, because we saw JD yesterday on another random trip.
185000	186000	So there's been lots of random trips going on.
186000	193000	Yeah, and I'll get into my gaming week on this one, but Shane sat me down to play the Danganronpa V3 demo in Japanese.
193000	194000	Nice.
194000	200000	And I'm actually pretty proud of how much of it I understood, so gay for me.
200000	206000	Before I introduce our third here, I just want to make sure the listeners know, you've been talking about the boot tonight.
206000	208000	You are, your foot is in a cast.
208000	209000	Yes, it's in a cast.
209000	211000	But you're going to be okay, you didn't like break your leg or anything.
211000	212000	No, it's not broken.
212000	217000	I've had, and I've got a problem actually with both of my feet, but my right foot is significantly worse.
217000	224000	Where there, I have a bunion, you know, 50% of the population has them.
224000	229000	Some people have them really severely, and I am one of the ones with a really severe bunion.
229000	233000	I actually want to get my x-rays because my feet look fucking bizarre.
233000	234000	No, seriously.
234000	236000	Well, to be fair, a lot of you looks fucking bizarre.
236000	239000	Girl, mirror.
239000	241000	You left the door wide open for that.
241000	246000	I am going to finish this chocolate tonight, by the way, since it only has like a week left on its life expectancy.
246000	247000	I'm going to eat it tonight.
247000	248000	Good for you.
248000	250000	But anyway, I'm an achiever.
250000	256000	But anyway, I also have heel spurs forming and problems with my Achilles tendon.
256000	261000	So I was supposed to be wearing a boot that I could take off, but it didn't help.
261000	266000	So now I'm in a boot for a month, but the, they took mercy on me.
266000	268000	I get to have it changed out next Friday.
268000	271000	And so that it's not like completely gross and disgusting.
271000	275000	But no DDR for a little bit for you.
275000	277000	But I've learned to hobble around in it.
277000	285000	So, and I told Dan, if he pisses me off too hard, I'm going to kick him so far up the ass with this boot that he's going to be spitting up fiberglass.
285000	287000	What a, what a great mental image.
287000	288000	That is true love.
288000	289000	All right.
289000	291000	Let's say hello to, we can't continue to ignore.
291000	294000	Of course, the one and only tech master, Loki, also here in studio.
294000	295000	Hello.
295000	296000	Hi, how are you, Loki?
296000	297000	Fine.
297000	298000	Did you have a good week off?
298000	300000	I know you didn't travel like Jamie and I did, but.
300000	304000	I tried finding stuff to do that day, but it just wasn't, nothing was lining up.
304000	308000	There's nothing good playing in the theater and the times just didn't line up.
308000	309000	Yeah.
309000	316000	Like the movies, like they were like is either transformers, which is or like Wonder Woman, which has been fine, but they're both like two and a half hours long.
316000	320000	And it's like, it was just, I can't fit that in there.
320000	323000	So I wandered around aimlessly.
323000	329000	I tried to work on my, my programming stuff at like a Barnes and Noble, but it just wasn't happening.
329000	332000	It wasn't happening because I was unable to plug in my laptop.
332000	337000	And if I don't plug in this laptop, the battery just goes down super fast and it also throttles the CPU.
337000	340000	So it just, it was not having it.
340000	346000	Um, and then I thought about you though, because there was some game jam I was reading about the week we were gone.
346000	349000	I forget, I forget which game jam it was, but it was about basically making clicker games.
349000	350000	Yeah.
350000	351000	Yeah.
351000	352000	Did you participate?
352000	354000	Cause I knew you were thinking about it, right?
354000	357000	It's not, it's, it's more casual.
357000	359000	It's through the entire month of July.
359000	360000	Oh, okay.
360000	364000	And so yeah, it's like, like click, click, clicker, clicker jam or something like that.
364000	365000	Yeah.
365000	366000	It's, it's basically.
366000	371000	Not that we should ever be encouraging you to work on yet another project you won't finish.
371000	377000	However, I was like, all right, well if there's anything to divert his attention, a clicker game would be, would be it.
377000	380000	I mean, so like I, I do want to participate.
380000	383000	I am hesitant to see how much I did sign up.
383000	388000	I'm hesitant to see how much, um, if I can get anything done.
388000	394000	Um, because like if this weekend's any indicator, it's probably not very likely just, it's way too crazy.
394000	397000	And just at the end of the day, it's like, fuck this.
397000	400000	I have no brain power, but no, I've actually been thinking about it.
400000	409000	Like I had to, I had an initial idea that was more along the lines of it's time to car where it's fucking crazy and weird.
409000	412000	And then I kind of was looking for music to go along with that.
412000	417000	Couldn't find any ran across something else, which totally threw it in a completely different direction.
417000	419000	That's not so goofy, weird.
419000	423000	It's just, you know, kind of cool stylistic, I guess.
423000	432000	But I, you know, at one point I was, you know, anticipating that there was going to be, you know, fart noises with clicks and stuff like that.
432000	438000	So how mature I just haven't, you know, I, I don't know, maybe some, but no, I haven't,
438000	440000	I haven't completely different direction with it.
440000	449000	So I'm still in the designing idea phase right now because I want to make sure I know what I'm making before I make it.
449000	450000	But I do want to make something.
450000	451000	Well, good luck.
451000	454000	I hope you, I hope you finish one so we can actually play it.
454000	455000	We'll see.
455000	457000	I do want to give a big thank you.
457000	461000	My own birthday was, not everybody knows this, my own birthday was three days after OLR,
461000	467000	which is the whole reason why Alan and I went to Chicago in the first place was it was supposed to be a birthday trip.
467000	471000	But Loki just tonight surprised me with a little birthday gift here.
471000	475000	And this is actually a coloring book based on the Golden Girls.
475000	477000	And I thought this was fantastic.
477000	479000	It goes along with the gentle little jousting I sent you.
479000	481000	Yes, yes, I got that on Steam as well.
481000	482000	Thank you for that.
482000	484000	I haven't had a chance to play that yet, but I did see that.
484000	487000	And I was like, it's a bummer this game is banned from Twitch.
487000	488000	I could play that on Twitch.
488000	490000	I'll take you up some color pencils then as my gift.
490000	491000	Well, yeah.
491000	496000	And then my thought is, is that maybe I could actually do a Twitch feed because art is big on Twitch right now.
496000	500000	So I'll actually do a Twitch feed where I color my Golden Girls coloring book,
500000	502000	because that's about the only way you're going to get art out of me.
502000	504000	But I'll do a creative stream.
504000	506000	This thing I just put my mouth has curry in it.
506000	508000	Curry, dark chocolate truffle.
511000	513000	I'm going to be in trouble halfway through the show.
515000	517000	Did you bring your EpiPen in case? Are you all right?
517000	519000	I haven't had anything that I'm allergic to.
519000	521000	Oh, I thought the Spicer.
521000	523000	I gave you guys the paprika one.
523000	524000	Okay, yeah, yeah.
524000	525000	So we're good.
525000	526000	Oh my God.
526000	528000	All right. Enjoy, enjoy the chocolates.
528000	531000	We're going to get the play by play over there of the exotic chocolates from Chicago.
531000	532000	All right.
532000	535000	Tiger Claw in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
535000	537000	Which by the way, of course, if you are listening live,
537000	541000	we do tape live Sunday nights at the Voice Geeks Network of vognetwork.com.
541000	544000	Six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
544000	548000	And you can participate along with comments such as what Tiger Claw is saying to me right now.
548000	553000	Rob Roberts, eventually you need to do one of those IRL streams on Twitch.
553000	560000	I almost did yesterday because they built, I guess, the capability to do IRL streams right into the mobile app.
560000	563000	Like I guess that was a big update the Twitch thing got this week.
563000	566000	Which if you're not following me on Twitch, cheap plug, Rob Roberts.
566000	572000	But you could also follow the Vognetwork account on Twitch and it hosts everything as they go live.
572000	574000	But what was I going to say with that?
574000	577000	Oh yes, I went to round one randomly yesterday.
577000	581000	So I thought, oh, this would be fun maybe to do an IRL stream of me around the arcade.
581000	583000	But my cell signal in there was not so great.
583000	587000	Because it is in like the middle of an older mall that I think has thick walls.
587000	590000	Excuse me, so I don't think my cell signal was very great in there.
590000	592000	So that didn't happen. Sorry.
592000	596000	Maybe next time I'll find a Wi-Fi to tether to and we can do that.
596000	598000	But I've given the IRL thing some thought.
598000	601000	I kind of think I'm kind of boring though.
601000	607000	So I hope you guys have some good questions or ideas to make it more entertaining if I do do an IRL thing at some point.
607000	608000	So we'll see.
609000	615000	Anyway, yeah, I know it's funny because Tigerclaw also points out Twitch's IRL is what Justin.tv used to be.
615000	618000	Yeah, it's funny how these things come full circle, isn't it?
618000	621000	Totally is. Remember when OLR was on Justin.tv?
621000	625000	Perhaps if they had marathon Pokemon, you know, Sesame, or what was it?
625000	628000	Mr. Rogers, Bob Ross.
628000	630000	Bob Ross, they wouldn't have gone under.
630000	632000	Found that secret sauce a long time ago, right?
632000	633000	Alright.
634000	636000	Anyway, let's see.
636000	638000	Going to chat over at live.fognetwork.com.
638000	641000	Raginator says, genital jousting and a Golden Girls coloring book.
641000	644000	Definitely has Rob Roberts' name written all over it.
644000	650000	Now all he's missing is a personal visit from ABBA, the original cast of Rocky Horror Picture Show, and Cher.
650000	655000	I've met two of the, well, three of the original cast of the movie, Rocky Horror.
655000	657000	I don't know if I'll ever get a chance to be sure.
657000	659000	And plenty of them were in the stage production.
659000	661000	Yes, two of the three were in the stage production.
661000	663000	Let's see, a personal visit from ABBA.
663000	664000	I would die.
664000	666000	You can't even get ABBA all in one space anymore.
666000	673000	The last time ABBA all was in one space, there was the movie premiere of Mamma Mia, but there was one time after that.
673000	674000	Not that long ago.
674000	677000	Can you disguise yourself as a child with cancer?
677000	679000	Because we can maybe work that.
679000	682000	Okay, there's some things that you don't joke about, and I think that's one of them.
682000	684000	So, there's certain lengths I'm not going to go to.
684000	692000	Let's see, and yeah, so, but we could do an IRL stream when I go to Rocky Horror sometime.
692000	696000	I don't know if that would be appropriate for Twitch, but I guess there's one way to find out.
696000	699000	All right, anyway, all that stuff aside, we need to talk about video games.
699000	701000	I want to get into tonight's kickoff topic.
701000	708000	So, tonight's kickoff topic has to do with a game that was recently pulled from the PlayStation Network and the PlayStation Store.
708000	712000	I don't know if there's anything you want to say about this, Loki, because you're the one that brought this story to my attention,
712000	721000	but I guess there was a game on the store called Star Star Star, like five star, 1000 top rated was the name of the game.
721000	726000	As if that doesn't sound like one of those, like, trash games on Google Play or Apple Store.
726000	734000	Ironically enough, because I do, you know, cheap plug, I've watched, you know, Jim Sterling religiously,
734000	737000	and he was the one that kind of brought this to attention.
737000	743000	He had a whole segment about, you know, a bit about it, and yeah, there's a lot of these guys,
743000	750000	and this is, I think, one of them that are kind of some of the ones that make the dynamic themes that are out there.
750000	752000	There's a bunch of them, they're ridiculous.
752000	754000	And I think all those ridiculous themes like, you know.
754000	756000	Like anime girl themes and stuff like that.
756000	758000	Lady with cleavage.
758000	762000	I'm pretty sure, I think just based off the screenshots I've seen, I think this is the same one,
762000	766000	but there are some other ones that they released that was like, you know, big titty anime babes,
766000	770000	but like with this really shitty Arkanoid game that was over it and stuff.
770000	776000	And actually, this one is even worse, it's a slide puzzle game, and they have like, okay,
776000	780000	the guy on the website is like, yeah, you get a platinum trophy in 20 minutes,
780000	782000	there's a walkthrough on how to do it and stuff like that.
782000	784000	Just like being completely blatant about it,
784000	789000	and just wanting, you know, people to purchase the game to get a platinum trophy.
789000	796000	Like, like anyone would give a shit that you have a platinum trophy for star star star, you know, 1000 top rated.
796000	803000	It's ridiculous, but it's kind of this garbage that was from, you know, that you would see it like on Steam,
803000	805000	Greenlight almost, that's just-
805000	810000	Well, there's actually a trailer that's linked here, and I don't know, oh my, oh, it's a minute long trailer here.
810000	816000	So, it's just 1000 4K images, and it's slide puzzles.
816000	820000	So, something that somebody would make in a second.
820000	822000	And they're showing that you get all these trophies.
822000	827000	Oh, they're just advertising how easy it is to get all these trophies, including a platinum trophy as a part of that.
827000	833000	So, and this is a 98 cent game, and that's it, it's tile puzzles that are super easy to complete,
833000	838000	and you end up basically getting a platinum trophy as essentially a freebie, let's just call it that,
838000	842000	out of the game that you paid 98 cents for.
842000	849000	Sony has apparently pulled the game, and asked the developer to rename it and remove any mention of the trophies.
849000	855000	Oh, so they're gonna remove the advertisement for it, but they're gonna leave the game up there, it sounds like.
855000	856000	Just rename the-
856000	859000	Sony gets a percentage of those profits too, so.
859000	861000	That's pretty fucking lame.
861000	866000	Okay, so it brings me to this question, this is the question I pose to all of you in our chat over at live.fognetwork.com,
866000	872000	as well as those of you in studio here is, so clearly this is essentially, let's call it what it is,
872000	875000	pay a dollar, get a platinum trophy.
875000	876000	Yeah.
876000	880000	Is that something you're willing to do? How important are trophies to you?
880000	883000	No, it's not, it's not worth this crap being cluttered up in my-
883000	889000	It's like, it's not even earning it, it was just like garbage, why, who would even care?
889000	896000	Is it like, what's that give you? Nothing. I mean, what, do you rank or something? Like, what do either of the ranks do?
896000	898000	I'm like, nothing, I only pay attention to that.
898000	904000	On Sony they don't really do anything, in fact the only place I've really seen it tied to anything is on Steam,
904000	909000	as you level up on Steam, but that's not, that's not based on achievements, so that's based on trading cards.
909000	914000	Seriously, like, watching through, um, like, some of these videos that Jim Sterling has,
914000	921000	not even necessarily just this game, there's other games, there's a lot of shit that's slipping through under the radar with Sony,
921000	925000	like broken ass games that are appearing on their storefront.
925000	932000	It's like, where's the fucking oversight for this stuff? This is, it's gonna get as bad as it was on Steam,
932000	938000	I mean, it's already pretty bad because, you know, all those games that were sitting there in, you know, Greenlight Limbo there,
939000	945000	they approved all of them before they shut that service down, so it's a big fucking flood of thousands of games.
945000	951000	Okay, but let me, let me ask this, is this to say, now let's take this whole dollar for a platinum trophy thing out of the equation.
951000	956000	Are trophies in general or achievements in that whole thing, do they mean anything to you?
956000	961000	Because I feel like a lot of people read Nintendo, and I've been guilty of this too,
961000	965000	Nintendo gets read a lot because they've ignored this whole trend.
965000	972000	They don't have achievements and trophies in their games unless sometimes, like Smash Brothers kind of has its own little meta system,
972000	976000	but there's nothing that overarches the entire system, is what I mean.
976000	978000	And Nintendo kind of gets crap for that sometimes.
978000	983000	I mean, there's games that I'll keep playing that try to get all the trophies in them, like Skyrim is one,
983000	994000	where I may just quit otherwise, I mean, it's good like kind of goals, like to get to a certain, you know, do certain things to kind of see the full expanse of the game.
994000	1000000	Granted, developers can use it for really shitty purposes, and like, not only just this where it's super easy,
1000000	1006000	there's a ton of games that like, for example on Steam, where loading up the game gives you, you know, a trophy,
1006000	1010000	every bullet you fire gives you a fucking trophy, like ridiculous shit like that.
1010000	1018000	And it's just to kind of boost your levels up on their service, so it's, I don't know, it's just about using it in the right way.
1018000	1027000	I just, I feel like we are, we have come so close to the edge of a really good idea, and Sony was kind of close to this,
1027000	1034000	I think the closest idea that I always thought kind of like would benefit Nintendo very well, was when Sony had PlayStation Home, remember that?
1034000	1040000	And when you got trophies in certain games, you would unlock virtual loot in PlayStation Home,
1040000	1045000	either it was a shirt, or it was like an actual trophy for your house or whatever, in the PlayStation Home.
1045000	1047000	Yeah, you're supposed to have a trophy group that never came.
1047000	1053000	Right, that whole thing, right? So, I mean, you know, which, for the people that were super into PlayStation Home,
1053000	1057000	which I remember a few years ago on this show, we had some listeners that were like super into PlayStation Home,
1057000	1061000	we had an awesome little VOG clubhouse and all this stuff, and you know, a lot of it was rewards from games.
1061000	1067000	Well, okay, the reason why I bring that up and say that in the same breath as Nintendo is that Nintendo has Miitomo, right?
1067000	1074000	So, and even some of this is with Tomodachi life, right? So they've had this idea of customize your outfits on your Mi,
1074000	1080000	have your room with your posters and all this, so I always kind of thought Nintendo was missing out on,
1080000	1087000	oh, well, what if there was like a Miitomo type thing on Switch where you could have your virtual rewards that showed,
1087000	1097000	hey, I beat, you know, Zelda Breath of the Wild, or even some day they have a virtual console thing and I beat Super Metroid,
1097000	1103000	or yes, Bobby Black Wolf, I beat Chrono Trigger, and I could have those little things on the wall,
1103000	1106000	like posters and shirts and things, and I could show that to my friends.
1106000	1108000	Oh, God, what's the punchline? What's the punchline, Bobby?
1108000	1112000	We already have it, except they're doing exactly what this company's doing.
1112000	1115000	You're paying for those trophies. They're called amiibos.
1115000	1120000	You get your fucking trophy and you can re-team it in other games and you get your little skin saying,
1120000	1125000	hey, look at me, I'm super awesome because I bought the Link amiibo.
1125000	1131000	That's what it is. I mean, it's this fucking thing, except in actually having to earn it, you go to the store,
1131000	1135000	you earn that money at your day job, you go to the store, you buy your little trophy,
1135000	1139000	and then you share that trophy in game because they got to justify the cost of that trophy.
1139000	1143000	You didn't do anything besides fight people in a line at GameStop to get that amiibo.
1143000	1145000	That was the achievement.
1145000	1150000	Well, nowadays with Nintendo's stock, you know, maybe that is an achievement.
1150000	1151000	I just think it would be-
1151000	1155000	You got an SNES mini. The whole system should be a goddamn amiibo, okay?
1155000	1159000	You should be able to put the whole system onto stuff and have SNES stuff.
1159000	1165000	I just think it would be great if you could unlock these types of things and then it's like your badge of honor.
1165000	1173000	But like, you know, if I have a poster or a reward I got from 5-star 1000 top rated, that wouldn't mean anything.
1173000	1176000	Like, I would have friends that would see that and go, what the hell's that game? Well, whatever.
1176000	1177000	Oh, Chrono Trigger.
1177000	1178000	Why'd you waste some money on that?
1178000	1180000	No, why'd you waste money on that? Anyway, look at these.
1180000	1182000	And I just think that would be so cool.
1182000	1187000	You should do a livestream. Let it go really long. Just play that shitty ass game.
1188000	1190000	There's other good games that could be playing on the line.
1190000	1195000	Okay, let me ask you. Dark Sakura, you have been a long time gamer through many classic games and so forth.
1195000	1198000	What's your stance on, in general, achievements and trophies?
1198000	1201000	Do they mean anything to you? Do you use them as goals like Loki or what?
1201000	1202000	Eh.
1202000	1203000	Eh?
1203000	1204000	Don't give a crap.
1204000	1205000	Big mess that you don't really care about.
1205000	1209000	I really don't care. I like achievements that are tangible.
1209000	1216000	That, you know, like, if I got an achievement in a game and suddenly it gave me one of these delicious chocolates.
1217000	1220000	That would be worthwhile. That would feel like a fucking reward.
1221000	1226000	Or it's like, you've got the highest score in this game. You get a pedicure.
1227000	1229000	Okay, that would be tangible. That would be something that-
1229000	1231000	You want real life rewards for things.
1231000	1233000	That would be something that adds value to my life.
1233000	1234000	Yeah, that would be great.
1234000	1240000	You know, unlike where I get an award at work and I get, like, points to get work swag or something.
1240000	1244000	Or, you know, kudos that make me hirable for another position.
1245000	1253000	A kudo in a game is like, okay, I did a thing that I was going to do anyway. I don't care.
1254000	1259000	The only time that I've ever been kind of antsy on doing one is one that-
1259000	1264000	Actually, there is a game I was interested in achievements in for a while and that was WoW.
1265000	1267000	Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah. World of Warcraft. Sure.
1267000	1270000	Because I would- Eventually, for some of them, I'd get something from it.
1270000	1271000	Like a mount.
1271000	1272000	Like a mount.
1272000	1273000	Okay.
1273000	1275000	You know, that dumb little pug dog.
1276000	1278000	For putting up with other people.
1278000	1282000	We need something like, maybe there could be a mobile phone app that would generate QR codes you could take to the store.
1282000	1287000	So, like, for example, you just beat Dead or Alive Xtreme Volleyball 2.
1287000	1293000	Take this barcode to Rite Aid for a tub of KY and a pack of socks.
1294000	1295000	Well-
1295000	1296000	There's little socks there?
1296000	1297000	Yes.
1297000	1298000	Yes, they do, actually.
1299000	1307000	But still, I would like a tangible reward for it. Something that enriches my life apart from just ego-fapping.
1308000	1313000	Okay. I think that's a great idea, though, is that, like, you could actually get, like, little rewards.
1313000	1319000	Why not? There was that Foursquare or Swarm or whatever it is you could check into Chili's and you get free chips and salsa.
1319000	1321000	Doesn't Facebook kind of have stuff like this, too?
1321000	1322000	Go on.
1322000	1324000	It used to be this way. I don't think they still do.
1324000	1332000	Well, there was a thing with Dan's work that if, like, this was at, um, crap, what was it? At, um, Outback.
1333000	1342000	That if, like, their driver in NASCAR won a race, then you got, like, a free Bloomin' Onion or something.
1342000	1348000	Oh, yeah, they do that with the Kings here locally. When the Kings actually win a game, you get, like, a free taco at Jack in the Box.
1348000	1351000	It's win-win. There's no way it's ever gonna happen.
1351000	1356000	Exactly, and it's, like, they never have to give away tacos. No, no, it's tacos are for the Sharks.
1356000	1365000	When they score a goal in the last two minutes of the second quarter, or second period, you get tacos from Jack in the Box. I remember that's a thing.
1365000	1367000	The Carl's Jr. was for the Kings.
1367000	1369000	Why would they punish their fans like that?
1370000	1375000	Some people, you should, you should have been there when they fuckin' scored a goal and everybody got a fuckin' taco.
1375000	1377000	Sweet, crabby tacos!
1378000	1379000	Well, at any rate...
1379000	1380000	You know, there's no cost hardly anything.
1380000	1386000	I think it's, it's the NASCAR one is a bit better, because that has a lower chance, because, what, it's 18 drivers? 20-something drivers?
1386000	1387000	Yeah, yeah.
1387000	1393000	And then, um, to have their sponsored car win, that many Bloomin' Onions for people who'd go in, you know?
1393000	1394000	Yeah.
1394000	1396000	But, at any rate, that's besides the point. You know, I like...
1396000	1398000	We wonder why we have an obesity problem in America.
1398000	1405000	I like a reward that enriches my life, instead of ego-fapping, which is gonna be my official term for it now. Ego-fapping.
1405000	1407000	Uh, isn't there a guy called that on YouTube?
1407000	1408000	I don't care.
1408000	1417000	Alright, anyway, moving on. Uh, Bobby Blackwell says, that barcode, talking about my, my trip to Rite Aid, that barcode gets copied on the internet and then they run out of socks.
1417000	1427000	No, it would be, it would be a unique code. Like, what? They can generate codes for, uh, unlockable items in Final Fantasy XIV by going to store, or any pre-order bonus you open in a manual.
1427000	1428000	Top Noodle?
1428000	1430000	Just unique codes. Would that, would that be so difficult?
1430000	1432000	It should be like a single-use coupon.
1432000	1433000	Yeah. And then, like...
1433000	1435000	And once the coupon's redeemed, it's no longer valid.
1435000	1448000	Yeah, I don't know. Anyway, uh, so, uh, Dungeon Buster goes on to say in our chat, uh, as much crap as Ubisoft's Uplay gets, uh, I like what it does with its achievement points by turning it into currency you can use to get DLC extra.
1448000	1449000	I do like that.
1449000	1451000	I have to, yeah, I do like that too. Like, you can get...
1451000	1452000	See, that's...
1452000	1453000	...remixes in Just Dance.
1453000	1454000	A reward.
1454000	1455000	Yeah. Okay.
1455000	1456000	That's a reward.
1457000	1468000	So, let's go back to the Nintendo thing for a minute, because they kinda, like, have half of this already right in Miitomo. You do, you get, you answer enough questions, you do whatever, you get the coins...
1468000	1469000	Yeah.
1469000	1470000	...that you can then buy special outfits.
1470000	1472000	And still playing Miitomo.
1472000	1485000	Right. But can't Nintendo put this idea in other stuff too? I mean, Mario Run had it, right? You get the trophies in your little town. So, I mean, virtual rewards then. All the socks, because they're digital socks.
1485000	1495000	So, like, looking, and this is actually fresh on my mind because of Steam. Like, I know that now Steam is giving you these stupid stamps that are, like, you get a discount on a game that you don't give a shit about.
1496000	1498000	The stamps get you discounts? I thought the stamps were, like, literally...
1498000	1499000	No.
1499000	1504000	I don't know. I get stuff sent to my, you know, there's, like, a whole bunch of crap cluttering my inventory with all these discounts.
1504000	1509000	I've gotten some crazy discounts for some stuff, and only, like, I've only ever used the discount, like, once.
1509000	1510000	Hmm.
1510000	1515000	Even though I, now, I did only buy two things in the Steam sale, but I'm going to go into that in my gaming week.
1515000	1523000	I did like the article they read where people are using this, of course, true fashion. People are using the stickers to make erotic scenes in their little...
1523000	1526000	Because of course. Because internet. Because of course.
1526000	1528000	It's the internet. Of course you're going to do that.
1528000	1529000	Because of course.
1530000	1535000	Let's see. Vidpower in chat says, somebody put ego fapping on Urban Dictionary's stat.
1535000	1539000	But that's followed up with, Raginator says, put in Chivo fapping if it ain't already there.
1539000	1542000	And Eric RPG says, trophy stroking.
1542000	1544000	Great. Look what we've started here at OLR.
1546000	1547000	Anyway.
1547000	1549000	I was just kind of curious what you all felt about this.
1549000	1554000	You know, because achievements were brand new ten years ago on the Xbox 360, or twelve, whatever, on the Xbox 360.
1554000	1558000	And now it's, like, we've been, that's a part of our gaming world now ten years later.
1558000	1559000	People expect it.
1559000	1560000	Yeah.
1560000	1565000	And people would, you know, try to run after those, you know, especially with achievement points because they gave you a score.
1565000	1570000	Trophies I don't think so much because now it's more of, like, a level in the number of platinums you have.
1571000	1578000	So that's not so much, but, like, I know, like, with achievement points it's like, ooh, I can get, like, a thousand achievement points in that game.
1578000	1580000	Or, you know, oh, they upped it to twelve fifty now.
1580000	1584000	Well, even Microsoft themselves. Remember when Rare Replay was first advertised?
1584000	1588000	Even Microsoft themselves was, like, over thirty thousand achievement points available.
1588000	1594000	Or some, I don't remember what the exact number was because some of the games being arcade hits are, like, only two hundred.
1594000	1598000	But you know what I mean. Like, there was, like, a pretty good number of achievement points available in that game.
1598000	1601000	And that was a selling point when they showed that original trailer at that E3.
1601000	1603000	Why not mention it? I mean, who cares? I mean.
1603000	1604000	Some people love that stuff.
1604000	1606000	Some people need their ego fapped.
1606000	1607000	That's right.
1607000	1615000	But even, you know what? I enjoy the occasional ego fap because, like, for example, games that I play a lot of.
1615000	1618000	Ingress and Pokemon Go, right? The AR games.
1618000	1623000	I like that there's a little fake badge collection in Ingress and I like collecting those.
1623000	1626000	Like, that's a lot of fun. And some of them, yeah, I've paid real money for badges.
1626000	1629000	But for me, they're a symbol of I participated in this event.
1629000	1631000	I went to Chicago. I played in this anomaly.
1631000	1632000	It's your participation.
1632000	1635000	It's my participation trophy. Yay! Millennials.
1635000	1641000	Or what's the term for us? Zennials. We're Gen X, but we feel close to Millennials.
1641000	1643000	Which I still feel my ear should have been included with that.
1643000	1650000	But the category was, like, if you were alive when, or if you were, like, an infant when Star Wars came out.
1650000	1651000	Yeah.
1651000	1652000	And I was an infant.
1652000	1653000	Which I was. So.
1653000	1655000	Now, you weren't born when Star Wars came out.
1655000	1660000	Oh, no, you're right. You're right. I was, I'm thinking the later films in the trilogy.
1660000	1661000	Anyway.
1662000	1666000	The generation talk is for another episode. A lot of that is silly.
1666000	1668000	I almost bought a cane so I could shake it at people.
1671000	1675000	Anyway, what else was I going to say in chat? Over at live.foggenetwork.com
1675000	1682000	Let's see, Dungeon Buster points out Nier Automata allows you to buy all of the achievements except one at one point in the game.
1682000	1686000	Oh, I remember that discussion that had come up on a previous episode.
1686000	1689000	That's very true. Very true.
1689000	1692000	Oh, with Ingress and Pokemon Go. So, the Ingress has the fake badges.
1692000	1698000	Pokemon Go now with this new redo of, I'm sorry, I'm spoiling a little bit of what we're going to get into in a little bit in the news.
1698000	1701000	But now you can collect gym badges. Right?
1701000	1706000	So, when you go to a gym and you spin a gym for the first time, you get a badge in your profile that shows you've been to that gym.
1706000	1711000	And you can level up that badge as you're doing, you know, the fights at the gyms and all this stuff.
1711000	1714000	So, this is all part of the makeover that, Loki, I know you'll get into later.
1714000	1716000	And then you can link those badges together to create a field.
1716000	1718000	That's the wrong game, Loki.
1718000	1724000	But anyway, so for the badges in Pokemon Go, now it's kind of like, I like collecting them on my profile.
1724000	1727000	Because that whole thing went live when I was in Chicago.
1727000	1730000	So, like, everybody knows the fucking bean in Chicago, right?
1730000	1733000	The big metallic, they call it Cloud Gate. I think it's the official name of that thing.
1733000	1735000	But it's at Millennial Park, right?
1735000	1739000	So, that was like one of the first gym badges I got was the bean.
1739000	1741000	And so, I think that's kind of cool that that's in my profile.
1741000	1746000	And that's very similar to Ingress. When you do missions, you can get a little sticker that showed like,
1746000	1749000	oh, you did a mission in Washington, D.C. at the Smithsonian or something like that.
1749000	1753000	So, now I've kind of made it this thing where like I really want to collect gym badges.
1753000	1757000	And I was out playing Pokemon Go with one of my pals today who doesn't play a lot of video games,
1757000	1758000	but does play Pokemon Go.
1758000	1762000	And now we've kind of turned it into this like ego war between us.
1762000	1766000	They're like, he's like, well, I have 79 gym badges. How many do you have?
1766000	1771000	And I'm like, I have 48, but I'm going to be working on kicking your ass because I know where to go
1771000	1773000	thanks to the other game to find all the gyms.
1773000	1782000	So, now that's becoming like a little, what is it? Ego fapping? Ego fap? Ego fapter thing between us.
1782000	1785000	So, there you go. Anything else you want to say?
1785000	1788000	I'm just, Dark Soccer is too busy eating chocolate.
1788000	1789000	Oh, my God.
1789000	1790000	Hoping for a partnership.
1790000	1799000	Okay, get this one. The one I'm eating now has macadamia nuts, Sri Lankan coconut, 45% cacao dark milk chocolate.
1799000	1801000	It tastes like...
1802000	1803000	Snobs.
1804000	1806000	It tastes like hipster.
1808000	1810000	And it's delicious. All right.
1810000	1816000	Let's talk a little bit about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week
1816000	1818000	since I'm starting to get into it anyway with this Pokemon Go chat.
1818000	1820000	But Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?
1820000	1822000	I played Pokemon Go.
1823000	1825000	I've been playing Miitomo.
1825000	1831000	I'm playing Sailor Moon Drops and Dragon Ball Doken, whatever that card game is.
1832000	1836000	But now, I've really been getting into Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2.
1836000	1840000	I know I'm a little late to the game, but the Steam sale put it for like almost half price.
1840000	1843000	So, I got like the full DLC and everything.
1844000	1848000	And I'm really enjoying it. I'm enjoying it far more than I thought I would.
1848000	1852000	I thought that I was just going to have a happy nerd moment, play it for like a little bit and be done.
1852000	1853000	Oh no.
1854000	1861000	The game is like 90% button mashing, fighting in space and fan service.
1862000	1866000	And the other part of it is incoherent screaming, which is Dragon Ball in a nutshell.
1867000	1869000	And I love every moment I'm playing it in Japanese.
1870000	1871000	Do you scream back?
1872000	1873000	No. Well, my character does.
1873000	1874000	My character does.
1875000	1882000	And I've been going around and there's NPCs in the game and some of their names are puns and it's fun.
1883000	1891000	And it's just like so much old school fan service that I've gotten this crazy nostalgic feeling and it's been so happy and I've really enjoyed it.
1892000	1896000	And the only thing is that there's certain things that aren't translated and I'm only understanding half of it.
1896000	1902000	So I've been going and actually using it to take a moment to study.
1903000	1904000	So it's been really helpful that way.
1905000	1909000	And I played a little WoW, not like a whole lot, because honestly, I'm kind of bored with Legion right now.
1910000	1912000	Even though like they've done the...
1913000	1918000	I started the LFR for the Sargeras Tomb, which is pretty good.
1919000	1922000	I mean, I'd like to... I'm going to try to level up again.
1922000	1927000	I think I'm like at item level 894 right now.
1928000	1929000	So pretty up there.
1931000	1932000	But no one ever plays.
1933000	1941000	And then I also went to Shane's and played the Danganronpa V3 demo, which is really great.
1942000	1947000	I mean, some of the stuff was funny and I was making fake translations.
1947000	1950000	I would translate the stuff that I could tell what they were saying for real.
1951000	1954000	But two of the characters from one of the other games...
1958000	1962000	Makoto from the first game shows up and then Hinata from the second game shows up.
1963000	1966000	And they're with you to be your senpai in game.
1967000	1968000	That's what they quite literally said.
1969000	1972000	But I'm still translating like, I still don't know what I'm doing in this game.
1973000	1974000	This is apparently a sequel, blah, blah, blah.
1974000	1975000	And it was really fun.
1976000	1981000	And I like the new thought drive, I think it was called, or logic drive.
1982000	1983000	I have to look it up again.
1984000	1993000	But it's basically where you're playing Outrun in a really like hyper neon 80s car with all the background and everything.
1994000	1998000	But you have to run through different letters to form your idea and then you have to answer questions.
1999000	2000000	It's really fun.
2000000	2004000	I suggest for fans of the series, get the demo, try it out.
2005000	2009000	You'd have to read a little bit to know what the answers are, but don't worry about it.
2010000	2011000	It's just super fun.
2012000	2013000	And the voice acting is great.
2014000	2015000	And I recognize a few of the voice actors too.
2016000	2019000	But I'm really excited then for Danganronpa V3 to come out.
2020000	2022000	I picked up also the Steam sale.
2023000	2025000	Ultra Despair Girls came out and it wasn't on sale, but I bought it anyway.
2026000	2029000	Even though I already have the Vita version for my PlayStation TV.
2030000	2037000	But I figured it'd be easier to play on my computer where I can use the mouse for choosing the bullets to use and everything.
2038000	2040000	So, yay for another game.
2041000	2044000	I'm not going to get to play for a while, but that's my gaming week.
2045000	2047000	Alright, we will move on then to Loki.
2048000	2049000	How was your gaming week?
2050000	2051000	I wish I played more, but I didn't.
2052000	2054000	I watched a lot of YouTube this week because I'm just like that I guess.
2054000	2061000	But I did want to mention though, speaking of YouTube, and I did try to work on games this week.
2062000	2065000	I'm mostly just thinking about them.
2066000	2074000	But one long time guy that was on our show has come back to start doing YouTube videos again.
2075000	2080000	So, Maximilian Moreau with PushyPixels is back and he's started doing more videos again.
2081000	2082000	Cooking with Unity?
2082000	2083000	Cooking with Unity, yes, absolutely.
2084000	2086000	So, he started working on a Space Invaders clone.
2087000	2088000	And he's been doing that.
2089000	2094000	So, yeah, definitely go support him because I know he's had a lot of real life issues that have kind of put him off for a while.
2095000	2097000	So, he's finally made it back, which I think is fantastic.
2098000	2100000	So, definitely fun to check that out.
2101000	2105000	But actual games I've been playing, all sadly mobile games, because that's...
2106000	2107000	That's where things are going these days.
2107000	2113000	And I joked, you know, when I was talking about the clicker thing on Twitter, the whole jam.
2114000	2119000	I'm like, yeah, if I can pull myself away from the clicker games that I'm playing now, and that's what I'm playing, including right now.
2120000	2122000	I'm playing the stupid office space clicker game.
2123000	2124000	And the reason why I think it's so...
2125000	2134000	Well, it's a lot of strategy involved with it because they do these little events that you basically can earn some of the stuff that you would normally pay in-game money for.
2134000	2139000	So, like the different card packs to boost your floor values and stuff.
2140000	2141000	So, you can actually earn.
2142000	2143000	Is that after your gaming week?
2144000	2148000	No. Pokemon Go. I'll go into more of that later because a lot of it would have to do with the raid stuff.
2149000	2151000	So, I actually did a raid against a Magikarp.
2152000	2154000	I was like, you may need five people for this. I'm like, I don't think I do.
2155000	2158000	And so, I was able to beat it with one Pokemon and it was stupid.
2159000	2163000	And then, sadly, that's it.
2164000	2166000	Alright, I think Jamie wants to interrupt here with another chocolate.
2167000	2170000	I interrupted this gaming week to say I'm eating the last of the chocolates.
2171000	2172000	Oh my god, that's the last one already?
2173000	2174000	I can't help it. They're so good.
2175000	2176000	There was only like nine of them, I think.
2177000	2178000	Well, and I ate eight. This is literally number eight.
2179000	2180000	Which one did you save for last?
2181000	2189000	This one is hazelnuts and 45% cacao dark milk chocolate because my favorite is hazelnut.
2190000	2191000	That sounds like a good standard to save for last.
2191000	2195000	So, I offer this tribute to myself. Thank you.
2196000	2199000	Thank you for kiddie-sitting. Thank you for kiddie-sitting Sanrio while we were away.
2200000	2201000	My pleasure, but thank you for the chocolate.
2202000	2203000	Alright, I hope it's good. I'm just waiting to see the reaction here.
2204000	2206000	Alright, let me get into my gaming week.
2207000	2211000	So, because I was gone for a week, I didn't really play as many games as I probably should have.
2212000	2215000	I was hanging out with some gaming podcasters, you guys might remember, though.
2216000	2219000	Delvin from Video Game Realness, which they've been doing shows sparingly here and there.
2219000	2221000	But we were hanging out a lot during the week.
2222000	2226000	And then my pals from the show Koopa Club, which they stopped about a year or so ago.
2227000	2229000	But I was getting to hang out with all of them in Chicago, so that was a lot of fun.
2230000	2236000	But as far as actual game playing, around the trip I've been playing Final Fantasy XIV Stormblood because of the expansion.
2237000	2241000	I talked a little bit about that last week. A lot has, two weeks ago when we were doing our show,
2242000	2245000	a lot of that has stabilized, thank heavens, since the launch of the game.
2246000	2248000	They're not having a lot of the network issues they were having previously.
2249000	2254000	Some sparingly on the more crowded servers, but I'm not on one of the crowded servers, so I'm not really having a lot of the issues.
2255000	2259000	But I'm kind of just taking my sweet ass time through the content, because everybody else kind of raced to 70.
2260000	2264000	So, I wasn't going to win that race, so I'm trying to treat it a little more as a marathon than a sprint.
2265000	2270000	So, I'm like level 67, but the content I'm doing is like only level 64.
2271000	2274000	For those that have been playing, I'm in Yanxia, I just got there to that zone.
2275000	2277000	So I've been kind of playing around with that a little bit.
2277000	2281000	Outside of MMOs, I've been playing just a little bit of other stuff.
2282000	2283000	When I was on the plane, you want to talk about random?
2284000	2287000	For whatever reason, I had my 3DS and I was going through my NES classics.
2288000	2290000	I started playing Zelda II, The Adventure of Link.
2291000	2294000	You know, that Zelda NES game, the one that a lot of people really don't like because it's too hard.
2295000	2297000	I just wanted to be like, how far can I remember this game?
2298000	2301000	So that way, if the plane were to go down, you'd be like, at least I can stop playing this fucking game.
2302000	2303000	Something like that.
2304000	2307000	No, I actually played through the first palace.
2308000	2312000	I found the second palace and I think that's finally when I was like, you know what, I'm going to go watch more Riverdale.
2313000	2316000	But I was pretty impressed with how much I actually remembered.
2317000	2324000	But god, those palaces, especially when you get to the second palace, I'm like, oh my god, there's so many more hallways and all this stuff than I remember.
2325000	2332000	I need a Nintendo Power that has the picture of what it looks like because I'm pretty sure I used those back in the day to actually beat that stinking game.
2333000	2335000	It's hard when it's all in your head and you're trying to remember.
2336000	2340000	Or I have a system that's like, I always go as far down and as far to the left.
2341000	2346000	It's kind of like that hole to solve a maze, always make left turns and eventually you'll find the exit, something like that.
2347000	2355000	So I was trying to do something like that with Zelda and it was, you know, it's just, god, that second palace is gigantic.
2356000	2360000	So I got stuck a little bit on that and finally I was like, I'm going to go watch more TV.
2360000	2364000	Other than that, I took a random trip to round one yesterday.
2365000	2370000	So I saw our pals from Game Buoy here at VOG Network. I met up with them at round one.
2371000	2377000	And you know when we go to round one, we play lots of Japanese music games, including, I played the crap out of Theatrhythm.
2378000	2385000	And still loving that. I played some Sound Voltex as well, some BeatMania 2DX, Cinnabuzz, I keep wanting to say Cinnabon.
2385000	2390000	But yeah, I was playing some of those games. So yeah, I got some arcade time in.
2391000	2396000	But as far as like other console stuff, I admittedly have not played a lot. I have not got sucked into the Steam sale.
2397000	2400000	I kind of, again, me being out of town, I kind of missed most of that.
2401000	2405000	I've been eyeing some things, but when's the last day? Is it the last day tomorrow or is it the last day of the fifth?
2406000	2412000	I think it might be the fifth, but like I've been looking at stuff. I think I may have, I can't remember, I did purchase, aside from Genital Jousting, I purchased...
2413000	2414000	Thank you for that gift, thank you.
2415000	2423000	It's gonna be funny. I purchased, I think I got the, what was it, the, that Lord of the Rings game.
2424000	2425000	God, I can't remember what it's called.
2426000	2427000	Lord of the Fallen?
2428000	2433000	No, the one that's like Arkham, but it's, what the fuck is it called? I can't remember.
2434000	2438000	But it's the big Lord of the Rings game, they have a sequel coming out, they showed it at E3 this year.
2439000	2442000	But it was down to like three dollars and something for the game of the year.
2443000	2444000	Shadow of Mordor.
2445000	2453000	I can't remember the name. But yeah, Shadow of Mordor was down to like three or four bucks, so, for the game of the year edition, so I was like, yep, I'll jump on that.
2454000	2460000	I don't think I really purchased much else, just because, I don't know, I didn't know what I wanted, really.
2461000	2466000	I was like, I have a powerful, I have a PC that can run all this stuff now, which should I play? I don't know.
2466000	2472000	Ragenator in chat is confirming that the fifth is the last day for the sale, and I know he knows his stuff when it comes to Steam sales, so there you go.
2473000	2475000	So I have a little time left to still get it on that, so that's good.
2476000	2480000	There are some things I'm eyeing, I'm looking at my wish list and trying to figure out what I might finally buy from that.
2481000	2487000	By the way, if you don't necessarily want to get it on Steam, it's also four dollars on the PlayStation sale as well.
2487000	2492000	Yeah, that's the other thing is that, like, Microsoft's having a big sale, PlayStation's having a big sale.
2493000	2499000	I just picked up on PlayStation, like, they had the classic Pac-Man, Galaga, Dig Dug, and you know I'm a sucker for classic games.
2500000	2504000	And there was only like four, not even four bucks, like three fifty for like all three of those games.
2505000	2510000	So I was like, eh, what the hell, which is, you know, what they're banking on people to do, but, you know, I picked those up easy.
2510000	2519000	So, it is interesting how other companies are matching the Steam sale, basically, trying to get a little bit of that Steam, and what's going on over there.
2520000	2526000	So, but I probably, I'm eyeing a few things on Steam, I'll probably get suckered into buying before the sale is over, so there's that.
2527000	2533000	So, let's see. Bobby Blackwell says, Oculus also had their sale, but it ended yesterday.
2533000	2539000	SDG100Matt points out Amazon Prime Day is the eleventh, so keep that in mind. We'll get this.
2540000	2550000	So, one of my monitors that I use to play games, my monitor on the right side is dying, like it flickers really bad now when I turn it on, like it'll stabilize after thirty minutes.
2551000	2553000	It's doing exactly what the studio monitor does, it's like, it's just getting old.
2554000	2561000	So, I'm like, maybe this is a sign it's finally time for Rob to go to 4K, so, let's see if they have any good deals on Amazon Prime Day.
2561000	2575000	Honestly, I don't know about 4K, it seems like people are going over 4K, they're doing the higher frame rate monitors, like G-Sync monitors and stuff like that, because it seems more bang for the buck, but I don't know.
2576000	2579000	Maybe. I haven't, I don't have a 4K display, so I can't.
2580000	2584000	Yeah, I don't know, it's kind of sold on Microsoft's thing that 4K gaming is where it's at. I don't know.
2584000	2596000	So, that's something I should get for my PC. I know I'm going to need another graphics card too, but you guys hear how much PC games I play, and I use a lot on PC to stream, so, you know, why not?
2597000	2607000	I think that's the direction I want to move in. Tiger Claw suggests getting an ultra-wide monitor. I don't know, I don't know. Dungeon Buster says Newegg has a sale on right now. Yeah, I'm thinking about that.
2607000	2615000	Speaking of streaming, I guess I can say this. So, guess what husband got me as a birthday present, sitting in the other room? A green screen.
2616000	2617000	That's so awesome.
2618000	2630000	I got a green screen from Husb to set up for when I'm doing streaming. So, honestly, my concern is, I'm like, this thing is too fucking big, it's not going to fit with both of us in the office, but he seems to think he knows a way to get it to work.
2630000	2643000	So, yeah, pretty soon on my stream, I'll actually have, instead of being able to see Alan behind me as he's coming, I'll have the green screen, so I can put, you know, boobies or packages or whatever I want, or 8-bit games.
2644000	2645000	Or more images of yourself.
2646000	2649000	The satellite of VoG, yes. Or, yes, more images of myself.
2650000	2654000	Just keep marrying the same thing, just like the infinite tunnel.
2654000	2658000	I like that, I like that. Just do the tunnel stuff there, so. Alright.
2659000	2662000	So, yeah, that's something I've got to set up pretty soon there.
2663000	2668000	Alright, that's it for my gaming week. Let's get into some housekeeping. I do have some housekeeping tonight. I have a little bit of it, actually.
2669000	2681000	So, first off, I want to give a shoutout to the Pokemon Go podcast, which is on iTunes, and I know there's a lot of people listening to them because there's a lot of people that are playing Pokemon Go, and with a name like Pokemon Go podcast, they're pretty easy to find.
2681000	2682000	It's Prime Real Estate right there.
2683000	2685000	It's Prime Real Estate. That's, when I ran into it.
2686000	2687000	Video games show the show.
2688000	2692000	And there is, there was, I think there was a show on all games, and I think they're still going, called Video Games Show.
2693000	2696000	There was a show called Video Game News Radio, I think was the name of it.
2697000	2704000	And then there's Video Games Show, I think is still going? I must confess, I haven't checked in in a while, there's so many podcasts, but I know they hit 10 years.
2705000	2707000	I know they were one of the podcasts that crossed the 10 year mark.
2707000	2709000	Somebody in chat will probably jump in there.
2710000	2717000	Bobby Blackwell confirms it is still going. Well, congrats to them, because that means they've got to be on at least like year 12 or 13 themselves, so congrats for them.
2718000	2720000	But anyway, what was I going to say with all that?
2721000	2722000	Oh yes, Pokemon Go podcast.
2723000	2733000	So, it was funny, I ran into, I know one of the guys, Charles, because he's always at Dragon Con, so I ran into him there at the podcasting track, and I actually remember talking to him there.
2733000	2738000	I was like, that's some prime real estate you got there with Pokemon Go podcast, and he's like, yeah, yeah.
2739000	2741000	So, because they've been, you know, they jumped on the opportunity to do it right away.
2742000	2749000	Well anyway, he remembered us having that conversation, and they had an opening on the show this week, because one of their hosts was participating in Nerdtacular this weekend.
2750000	2757000	So, I was sitting in as a guest host, and I was really happy and honored to be there, so I hope you all check that out, it's episode 51 of the Pokemon Go podcast.
2757000	2764000	And yeah, I got to talk a lot about Ingress, because there wasn't as much familiarity with that game over there, since, you know, that that's something I've played for a while.
2765000	2770000	So, I got to kind of talk about how the games have kind of impacted each other and the differences, since they are both Niantic games, so it was fun.
2771000	2776000	It'll be interesting to see how much Pokemon Go plays a factor in what Ingress 2.0 becomes.
2777000	2782000	And that is, you know, I didn't really get to get into that enough, because obviously I didn't want to dominate the whole, it was their show, I'm just a guest.
2782000	2793000	But for me personally, that is a real fascinating element, is now what is Pokemon Go going to do to Ingress with the 2.0, there will be an Ingress 2.0, it is coming, it's not a secret.
2794000	2799000	And it's probably coming by the end of the year, so I'm very, very curious about that as a fan of both games.
2800000	2806000	So anyway, shout out to Pokemon Go podcast, check out episode 51, and if you enjoyed my presence on the show, be sure to let them know.
2807000	2818000	Anyway, outside of that, something very exciting for VOG Network I want to mention is that this week, VOG Network, we have launched our official Discord, so we have a Discord for VOG Network.
2819000	2823000	Now, I know it's very easy to set up a Discord, and I know many people have their own Discords, and that's fantastic.
2824000	2829000	In fact, I know some other shows on the network have their own Discords, that is awesome, this is not being set up to compete with any of that stuff in any way.
2829000	2839000	But we thought, you know, some of the stuff that we've given to networking as podcasts, maybe we could do for networking as gamers, networking as Twitch streamers, networking as podcast producers.
2840000	2854000	So, if you want to join in on our Discord, you can, it's very easy to get to, just go to vognetwork.com slash Discord, or when you're on the VOG Network, at vognetwork.com, you can just go to under participate, there's a link that says Discord, and you can join our Discord.
2855000	2861000	And if you don't know what Discord is, it's a chat app that you can use on both your mobile phone and on your desktop.
2862000	2869000	It's a lot like Slack, which I know is very popular, it's a lot like that, but Discord is catered a little more towards gamers and has voice chat in it.
2870000	2876000	So we thought, ooh, this would be a really great way for when we're live streaming to be able to invite some people that watch the streams to chat with us.
2877000	2878000	And in fact, this is exactly how it played out.
2878000	2887000	So I ended up pulling the curtain back on this a couple days early, and it was one of those do the crime now, ask for forgiveness from Bobby Blackwolf later,
2888000	2896000	because a situation came up on the live stream where Shane and I were playing Final Fantasy XIV, but we wanted to help somebody else who was watching, who was on our server.
2897000	2906000	One of the guys, I know he listens to this show, FreeKillZero, was watching and needed some help with Titan, so we were offering to help, but we're like, we need a place where we can all chat, so we can talk.
2906000	2912000	So here we go, we got VOG Network Discord, so we all went over there, and that's why we ended up kind of putting the lid on that early.
2913000	2920000	But the cool thing also with the VOG Network Discord is that now whenever a show goes live, you'll get a chat message.
2921000	2927000	Whenever a new podcast gets posted, whether it's a gaming show or not, because we have lots of non-gaming shows that are awesome on the network,
2928000	2931000	like Hooked on Bond, Pod Culture, you know, we got a lot of great non-gaming shows on the network as well,
2931000	2935000	anytime a new podcast gets posted, you're going to get notified in the Discord about it.
2936000	2944000	Anytime a new article or TV review gets posted, those are going to come very soon as well, so you'll be able to see that as well, all in our Discord server.
2945000	2952000	So by all means, check it out, and sign up, there's certainly no cost or anything like that, so come be a part of the community at vognetwork.com slash Discord,
2953000	2957000	and get the latest on when we will be doing new things and new projects.
2957000	2962000	The one thing I do want to stress with that, IRC is not changing at this time.
2963000	2969000	Our chat during the show that we do at live.vognetwork.com, that's not changing, the IRC channel is not going away.
2970000	2975000	We see Discord more as a replacement of sorts for the forums, which are kind of dead, more than anything.
2976000	2981000	We're not going to delete the forums, but we're not oblivious to the fact that no one's really using them,
2982000	2985000	because we just live in an internet day and age now where things are a little more immediate,
2985000	2989000	so Discord's going to kind of be testing the waters for that.
2990000	2995000	But we still will be using live.vognetwork.com for you to chat along with the shows live on Sunday nights,
2996000	3000000	because with Discord you have to make an account, not everybody necessarily wants to do that,
3001000	3006000	but the nice thing about live.vognetwork.com, if you want to chat with the show, you go in there, you type in your name, done.
3007000	3010000	You can get in our chat room right there on the web applet, and that's a little easy,
3011000	3014000	and we don't want to get rid of that easeness anytime soon.
3015000	3018000	That's a lie. IRC may not be around forever.
3019000	3025000	Once we find an acceptable alternative, we may explore replacing it, but at this time it's not going anywhere.
3026000	3034000	So, going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, they're suggesting the ultra-wide monitors in there,
3035000	3038000	and it's kind of going back and forth a little bit on the ultra-wide monitors and if that's good or not.
3038000	3044000	Act F says they don't really work well with gaming, Tiger Claw says but there are games that support ultra-wide.
3045000	3051000	I don't know, if I was like maybe an artist or maybe for like an ultra-wide monitor at work would kick ass,
3052000	3056000	but yeah, for gaming, I don't know, maybe, maybe. What do you guys think about those ultra-wide monitors? Have you seen them?
3057000	3058000	It's like one monitor that's two in one.
3059000	3060000	I know they are.
3060000	3061000	Yeah. Do you like them?
3062000	3063000	I haven't used one much, but they're nice.
3064000	3065000	Yeah.
3066000	3067000	I like having my two monitors.
3068000	3071000	I was thinking about the two monitors, but I just talked about old school and new school.
3072000	3074000	Maybe I'll have to change my way of thinking sometime, so.
3075000	3079000	If I had a desktop, I'd probably have all sorts of fancy shit like that, but I'm using a laptop,
3080000	3082000	but my laptop screen's 17-inch, so that's pretty big.
3083000	3084000	That's true.
3085000	3089000	It's not ultra-wide, and I have seen some ridiculous shit that Asus put out with, you know, their,
3090000	3096000	I think it was Asus where it was like a three monitor setup for a laptop, which is a little fucking weird,
3096000	3099000	but someone's gonna use it, I'm sure.
3100000	3102000	Alright, so I got my plugs out there.
3103000	3106000	VOG Network Discord, Pokemon Go Podcast. Check them both out.
3107000	3112000	So now it's time for us to get into some gaming news, which, Loki, we keep talking about Pokemon Go.
3113000	3115000	I guess it's a good thing we have it here in the first slot of the show tonight, right, Loki?
3116000	3118000	Yes, it is, so I can talk a little bit more about my gaming week.
3119000	3121000	So they made the big update to the Pokemon Go gyms,
3121000	3127000	so now instead of being able to stack that shit full of all sorts of Pokemon that are large CP and HP,
3128000	3132000	you can now only put six Pokemon in there, and they all have to be different, so that's good.
3133000	3137000	And then when you fight each one, they have like a little heart meter that goes down,
3138000	3142000	it basically kind of wears them out, and then as that goes down, their CP drops,
3143000	3148000	and eventually they get weaker and weaker, but you can also boost them if you are on the same team,
3148000	3150000	by feeding them berries and that type of stuff.
3151000	3157000	And then one of the things you do also, which is kind of nice, is all those Pokemon gyms are also now Poke Stops,
3158000	3162000	so you can actually spin them like you can a Poke Stop, which is pretty awesome.
3163000	3164000	And then...
3165000	3167000	Oh, can I just say with that, because here's a tip, because I mentioned this earlier,
3168000	3172000	now I'm in a rivalry to collect those gym badges, so when you get a gym badge, they go in your profile,
3173000	3175000	and this is pretty cool, if you haven't seen this, go to your profile,
3175000	3180000	in Pokemon Go, tap on your face to see your profile, tap on the All for the badges,
3181000	3184000	and then in the lower left corner of the screen that shows all your badges,
3185000	3188000	well, for one, you can sort that screen so you can see, if you want to sort by Defender in the bottom right,
3189000	3192000	you can actually see where all the gyms are that you have Pokemon Defending right now, which is nice,
3193000	3198000	but in the lower left is a map icon, and it'll actually show a very rudimentary map of the United States,
3199000	3201000	but, I mean, unfortunately, it's not like Google Satellite or anything,
3201000	3206000	you don't see anything underneath it, but I'm hoping that in time, maybe there will be some type of basic layers under that,
3207000	3210000	but you can actually see where all the gyms are that you have badges for,
3211000	3214000	so for me, it's really cool, because I can see, like, I have eight gyms in Chicago,
3215000	3217000	just the badges, I'm not controlling them, I just happen to have the badges,
3218000	3220000	like, proof that I visited the Bean when I was in Chicago,
3221000	3223000	and I even have one at the Vegas airport when I was coming home,
3224000	3227000	so I just think that's really cool that you can actually get a map of all those places you've been to,
3227000	3229000	so it's a little feature not everybody's noticed.
3230000	3232000	Yeah, it's kind of cool. One of the new things, though, is raids,
3233000	3237000	so what raids are are these multiplayer kind of PvE things,
3238000	3240000	where you fight a Pokemon that has a really high CP,
3241000	3242000	and you can do it up to teams up to 20,
3243000	3246000	although the ones I've done, I've just soloed through them and...
3247000	3249000	Thirteen people on Lapras yesterday.
3250000	3253000	We did a, there was a last, well, Friday, there was a last month,
3253000	3258000	Ingres Farm, so it was like 20 of us Ingres players that all showed up over at Chicken Farm, right?
3259000	3262000	So, we went over to Chicken Farm, and so, of course, we're getting ready to start,
3263000	3266000	and, like, you know, you go through great lengths to make sure the opponents don't know that you're there,
3267000	3270000	waiting for the farm to start, and all of a sudden, just before we're about to start,
3271000	3272000	somebody goes, Lapras!
3273000	3278000	And, like, just a bunch of people take off for this, like, this particular gym,
3278000	3280000	that's down the street by one of the seedy bars,
3281000	3283000	and, like, there's, then a car pulls up,
3284000	3286000	so there's, like, ten of us Ingresers that were there for the farm,
3287000	3289000	and a car of three people, and we all took on Lapras,
3290000	3292000	and that thing fucking melted, with thirteen of us, it was awesome,
3293000	3294000	and I didn't catch the son of a bitch,
3295000	3296000	because I guess they've lowered the capture rate,
3297000	3299000	so some of those four-star Pokemon are really hard to catch.
3300000	3302000	Yeah, so that's the thing, so you do the raids, so you fight the Pokemon,
3303000	3305000	you know, with your six Pokemon, you get the Pokemon,
3305000	3307000	you fight the Pokemon, you know, with your six Pokemon,
3308000	3309000	you can play with up to twenty people,
3310000	3313000	and then, after you're done, I think the number of balls you get
3314000	3316000	are based off of, like, how well you do,
3317000	3318000	so, like, how much damage you deal, that type of thing,
3319000	3322000	and so, you, once you're done, you get an opportunity to try to catch
3323000	3324000	whatever it was that was in the gym,
3325000	3326000	which is kind of nice, because some of the stuff that's in there is, you know,
3327000	3329000	pretty, you know, like, hard to get,
3330000	3331000	I mean, so it was kind of nice to be able to get some of those things.
3331000	3335000	Um, so, but yeah, they are pretty weak, like, I had one,
3336000	3340000	it was, like, just a dark red, you know, with this, like, crappy ball,
3341000	3343000	I'm like, can I use, I'm gonna use this super,
3344000	3345000	because they have new berries on, we'll use this super berry
3346000	3347000	and see if that works, and it's like,
3348000	3350000	fuck your super berry, I'm still knocking this shit out of my way,
3351000	3352000	it's like, uh, what the fuck?
3353000	3354000	Yeah, I fed that fucking Lapras, like, four golden berries,
3355000	3356000	and it didn't work.
3357000	3358000	It's like, what the fuck am I supposed to do with this golden berry shit?
3358000	3362000	A golden berry will also completely heal a Pokemon in a gym,
3363000	3364000	as opposed to just a little boost, just a tip there,
3365000	3366000	if you want to use it for that.
3367000	3368000	But don't forget, also, when you're doing raids,
3369000	3372000	use those magic candies, I forget what they're called,
3373000	3374000	like, any candy or whatever, like, use them,
3375000	3377000	like, don't fucking let them take up space in your inventory,
3378000	3382000	if you're walking a Dratini so you can get enough for your Dragonite,
3383000	3386000	do those one or two star raids every day so you get some of those candies
3386000	3389000	and make them Dratini candies so you can get your Dragonite.
3390000	3391000	Like, that stuff is really helping.
3392000	3394000	Now my big thing is, I finally hatched a Tyranitar this week,
3395000	3398000	so there's that, uh, now it's Porygon, fucking Porygon,
3399000	3401000	and all those, like, I have like four or five of those stupid upgrades
3402000	3404000	so I can get a Porygon 2.0, but like, since you,
3405000	3407000	which, isn't it weird that Porygon's not on gyms,
3408000	3410000	you would think that would be one of the raid things that people need,
3411000	3412000	but they're not really showing up.
3413000	3414000	Wait, wait, so Magikarp.
3414000	3419000	I get why Magikarp's there, because those bonds that you catch on gyms are wonders,
3420000	3423000	so that's a good, um, somebody told me Magikarp's aren't in eggs anymore,
3424000	3426000	I didn't realize that, yeah, Magikarp's aren't in eggs anymore,
3427000	3429000	so Magikarp's on a gym is the only way you can somewhat guarantee yourself
3430000	3434000	a high IV Magikarp that you'll ultimately turn into a Gyarados.
3435000	3436000	So, there's that.
3437000	3440000	Um, what else, I was gonna say about that, so yeah,
3441000	3442000	those are, it's pretty neat.
3442000	3444000	The other thing, though, that they kinda got rid of, though,
3445000	3448000	um, they said, I guess you earn coins now every ten minutes
3449000	3451000	that your Pokémon defends a gym, so you can rack up coins that way.
3452000	3454000	Do you know how easy it is to get the 50 coin cap now?
3455000	3458000	Like, go take gyms at 11 o'clock at night,
3459000	3461000	not that I should be encouraging you to play these games in the dark,
3462000	3464000	but, you know, get some gyms in neighborhoods at 11 o'clock at night
3465000	3467000	when it's less likely that kids will be out to take them right back,
3468000	3470000	and by the time you wake up in the morning, your Pokémon will get knocked off
3470000	3473000	and you'll have 50 coins, because you only have to sit on a gym for, like, eight hours.
3474000	3478000	Now, they dropped the max from 100, which does have some feathers ruffled,
3479000	3480000	like I noticed in chat, SHO100Matt says,
3481000	3483000	I'm not really too happy about only being able to get 50 coins max a day
3484000	3486000	despite how many Pokémon you have in gyms.
3487000	3488000	There are some things they could do better with this system.
3489000	3491000	Like, it does kinda suck that you could end up getting a Pokémon,
3492000	3494000	like, trapped on a gym for days and days and days,
3495000	3497000	because nobody's gonna knock it off, and you can't get coins from it.
3497000	3499000	So we were talking a little bit about this on Pokémon GO podcast this week,
3500000	3504000	and it was suggested that, well, it would be nice if you could go back to that gym
3505000	3506000	and, like, cash out from that Pokémon.
3507000	3509000	That would be really awesome, but not there yet.
3510000	3513000	So I think this system, for me, this system is a huge improvement,
3514000	3515000	but there's still things that could be done better.
3516000	3517000	Yeah.
3518000	3521000	But in all, I'm really enjoying it because it makes me feel like I can play the gym game,
3522000	3525000	and I'm not having to knock down a gym of fucking 10 Pokémon
3525000	3527000	where eight of them are blissies.
3528000	3531000	Or it was even more than 20 Pokémon, just some ridiculous amount of Pokémon.
3532000	3533000	Yeah, gross.
3534000	3537000	And then you have to play through it a million times before it finally knocks the levels down.
3538000	3540000	But some of the Pokémon players are having problems with this
3541000	3543000	because if somebody really wants a gym, they'll take it.
3544000	3545000	There's nothing you can really do.
3546000	3549000	But welcome to the game of Ingress that I've been playing for a while.
3550000	3551000	If somebody really wants a portal, they'll take it,
3552000	3553000	and there's not a lot you can do about it.
3553000	3556000	Can you remotely recharge? You can't remotely recharge.
3557000	3558000	No, you cannot.
3559000	3562000	Anyway, I'm enjoying the changes, but I do see improvements,
3563000	3564000	especially with the coin redemption.
3565000	3568000	I absolutely think you should be able to go check in with Pokémon and withdraw coins.
3569000	3572000	And even still, with the whole new gyms and everything,
3573000	3574000	there's still no real scoring system.
3575000	3578000	There's nothing like Ingress where you can see the score for your team.
3579000	3580000	There's nothing.
3580000	3582000	Yeah, that would still be nice to see.
3583000	3584000	It's slightly better than Useless now.
3585000	3586000	Yes, it's playable.
3587000	3589000	And on top of that, real quick, I wanted to mention,
3590000	3595000	along with these new features, they made some tweaks for people that they catch cheating.
3596000	3600000	They found new ways to punish players who have caught Pokémon using third-party software.
3601000	3605000	They said that they're going to appear marked with a slash in the inventory
3606000	3607000	and may not behave as expected.
3607000	3610000	With the announcement of raid battles and new battle features,
3611000	3614000	we are staying true to our commitment to ensure Pokémon GO continues
3615000	3617000	to be a fun and fair experience for all trainers.
3618000	3622000	Starting today, Pokémon caught using third-party services that circumvent normal gameplay
3623000	3627000	will appear marked with a slash in the inventory and may not behave as expected.
3628000	3632000	We are humbled by the excitement for all new features that we announced yesterday, blah blah blah.
3632000	3635000	Fuck spoofers, fuck spoofers, fuck spoofers.
3636000	3638000	If you are playing Pokémon GO as a spoofer, fuck you.
3639000	3640000	No, it's not fun.
3641000	3645000	These games are about getting up and going out and exploring the world around you.
3646000	3649000	If you're sitting doing it on your computer, you are contributing nothing.
3650000	3654000	Go fuck yourself, and I am so happy that Niantic is doing things to fuck with you people
3655000	3659000	because I fucking hate this bullshit in Ingress and I hate this bullshit in Pokémon GO.
3659000	3661000	Spoofers go to hell.
3662000	3663000	And that's how I feel about it.
3664000	3665000	How do you feel about it, Logi?
3666000	3668000	I'm not that bent out of shape about it because I don't really play...
3669000	3670000	No, it's like cheating in an MMO.
3671000	3672000	You don't fucking do it.
3673000	3676000	It doesn't bother me personally, though, because it's not like Ingress
3677000	3678000	where actually there's a score to the game.
3679000	3680000	There's no real game yet to it.
3681000	3684000	It is infuriating when 40 people work together to put up a field
3685000	3686000	and put together a game, and they're like,
3686000	3688000	40 people work together to put up a field
3689000	3692000	and one ass dickhead in his mom's basement with no pants on takes it down.
3693000	3694000	I'm saying yes, I agree.
3695000	3696000	That is crap, and Ingress and Cheaters suck,
3697000	3701000	but in Pokémon GO, there's no scoring or anything,
3702000	3703000	so it doesn't really bother me yet.
3704000	3706000	When there's an actual game and scores and stuff like that,
3707000	3708000	then that might be a different story.
3709000	3710000	But yes, cheating still sucks.
3711000	3712000	Akdeft and Chat says,
3713000	3714000	Spoofers are bad and they should feel bad.
3714000	3717000	Look, if you want to run your own copy of Pokémon GO
3718000	3720000	on your own server where you can do whatever you want in a one-player mode,
3721000	3722000	go fucking do whatever makes you happy.
3723000	3724000	Listen, Pokémon GO is made in Unity.
3725000	3726000	Make your own fucking Pokémon GO.
3727000	3728000	Brad from Pod Culture says,
3729000	3732000	Rob Roberts, what about folks who are mobility impaired and can't get out?
3733000	3737000	I think Pokémon GO has gone to lengths to ensure that,
3738000	3739000	I mean, if you're mobility impaired,
3739000	3744000	wouldn't you still be able to go to wheelchair accessible areas,
3745000	3746000	like, you know, all parks?
3747000	3749000	As far as I know, unless it's a mountain or something,
3750000	3751000	you can use a wheelchair to get around.
3752000	3753000	You can still play at home.
3754000	3756000	You can just buy Poké Balls and throw them at the critters that walk by.
3757000	3759000	But, what was I going to say?
3760000	3763000	Really, the way they should be punishing these people that cheat in those games,
3764000	3765000	they should have to play Garfield GO.
3765000	3770000	Yes, you should have to be playing Garfield GO, absolutely.
3771000	3773000	So, Brad continues on,
3774000	3776000	there for many months I had mobility issues and couldn't drive.
3777000	3781000	It's one of those things where I feel sympathy for that situation
3782000	3783000	and that's really unfortunate,
3784000	3790000	but that doesn't give somebody the right to then go and play this game on easy mode
3791000	3794000	that a lot of people are having to really work to,
3795000	3797000	you know, take down things like gyms and stuff like that.
3798000	3802000	I just don't think it excuses the act of spoofing at the end of the day.
3803000	3806000	There are still things that you can do, you know,
3807000	3809000	in certain parks and other publicly accessible areas.
3810000	3812000	It's one of those things where I feel sympathy,
3813000	3816000	but it doesn't excuse the act of spoofing to me.
3817000	3819000	I've been in my boot, you know what I've been doing?
3820000	3824000	I ask people to stop me by there if they get a ride.
3825000	3827000	I catch Pokémon from my bathroom.
3828000	3830000	You find ways to make it work, you know?
3831000	3833000	Exactly, I can't hit a Pokéstop maybe every day,
3834000	3835000	but I can get my one catch a day.
3836000	3839000	Like when I was super sick and trying to play Ingress,
3840000	3842000	either I just broke the damn hacking streak
3843000	3845000	or I would just say like,
3846000	3849000	alright, I'm gonna just leave the houses once to go to the nearest portal
3850000	3851000	and come right back to keep my streak going, you know?
3851000	3854000	The whole thing is that in the end, it's a game,
3855000	3857000	and don't screw it up for everybody else just because you're inconvenienced.
3858000	3859000	Yes, so.
3860000	3862000	Anyway, well, okay, and then Brad from Pod Culture continues,
3863000	3864000	on the other hand, there's a Pokéstop I can reach from my couch.
3865000	3867000	Well, there you go. It's not so bad.
3868000	3871000	Anyway, look, I realize that it gets into a more controversial issue
3872000	3874000	when we start talking about these other types of challenges,
3875000	3876000	and I am all, do not get me wrong,
3877000	3879000	I am all for accessibility in gaming.
3879000	3882000	I am all for always having remappable controls,
3883000	3886000	being able to do visual editing and all these easy fixes in games,
3887000	3890000	but I draw the line at spoofing your location
3891000	3894000	to fake to people that you're at the top of a mountain in the middle of snow season
3895000	3897000	when everybody knows that is fucking impossible for anybody,
3898000	3900000	able-bodied or otherwise, to be able to do.
3901000	3902000	So that's kind of where I draw the line,
3903000	3904000	and I hope you guys can see the difference.
3905000	3906000	Anyway.
3906000	3909000	No, don't even with that clickbait news headline, people.
3910000	3911000	Alright.
3912000	3916000	SSU100Matt says, Rob did go outside in single-digit temperatures with Windchill
3917000	3919000	to play Ingress during Magfest. Confirmed.
3920000	3923000	Yes, that did happen. That was one of the stupidest things I've ever done in my life.
3924000	3926000	Alright, let's talk about a less bad gaming decision, shall we?
3927000	3930000	And that would be the decision to put Pac-Man Versus on the Nintendo Switch.
3931000	3932000	Yeah, that's gonna be awesome.
3933000	3934000	Did you guys ever play Pac-Man Versus?
3934000	3935000	No.
3936000	3937000	Well, now you'll have a chance.
3938000	3940000	Jamie, how does Pac-Man Versus work, if you remember?
3941000	3943000	You have one person as Pac-Man and the other people who are the ghosts.
3944000	3945000	That's right. And the ghosts have their own screen,
3946000	3947000	and like Pac-Man's on the TV or something, right?
3948000	3951000	So, anyway, what's gonna happen is this is gonna come to the Switch,
3952000	3953000	but it's part of another collection.
3954000	3956000	There's a collection called the Namco Museum Collection,
3957000	3961000	and this collection is gonna include other Namco games as well,
3961000	3963000	including Pac-Man and Dig Dug, which shows up everywhere.
3964000	3969000	But stuff like Galaga 88, Sky Kids, Splatterhouse, Rolling Thunder 1 and 2.
3970000	3972000	So that's pretty cool. Some other deep cuts from Namco in there.
3973000	3977000	But yet, no Mappy. Why does Namco continue to hate Mappy Dark Sakura?
3978000	3979000	I don't know either. I don't understand this either.
3980000	3983000	Alright, anyway, but Pac-Man Versus is gonna be a part of this as well.
3984000	3987000	So, unfortunately, you can't just do it all on one Switch.
3988000	3989000	That's not gonna work very well for the game.
3989000	3994000	However, each team needs their own Switch, but you can do up to three people on one console.
3995000	3997000	So you could have one person being Pac-Man on their Switch,
3998000	4000000	and another three people being the ghosts on another Switch.
4001000	4004000	So that's something possible you can do. So, very cool about that.
4005000	4009000	That collection is releasing on July 28th, so you don't have a long time to wait for that.
4010000	4014000	So that's pretty cool. I can't wait to finally really get to spend some time playing Pac-Man Versus,
4015000	4016000	because I didn't really get to before.
4017000	4018000	Moving on, Dark Sakura.
4019000	4022000	Well, there's been a lot of talk about it. We've brought it up already.
4023000	4030000	But, there is that new Super Nintendo Mini Classic thingy that's coming out, right?
4031000	4032000	The SNES Classic.
4033000	4036000	It's going to have 21 classic Super Nintendo games in it,
4037000	4041000	but among them is going to be a game that was heavily advertised,
4042000	4044000	and then dropped off the face of the Earth.
4045000	4046000	And that is Star Fox 2.
4046000	4051000	Star Fox 2 had a lot of different new mechanics in it. I've played a ROM of it before.
4052000	4056000	You have walker mode in there, and different characters and everything.
4057000	4062000	But, as far as games that were mostly completed and never released,
4063000	4066000	Star Fox 2 has been a big one up there for a lot of fans of the series.
4067000	4070000	We didn't have anything between the first Star Fox and Star Fox 64 that came out.
4071000	4074000	This one had been in all of the magazines.
4074000	4081000	There was a playable version at the 1995 Consumer Electric Show.
4082000	4084000	But, where did it go?
4085000	4087000	So, we're going to finally get it.
4088000	4095000	I think that is so rad that a game from the archives that long ago is going to be available now all these years later.
4096000	4099000	It's kind of similar a little bit to what they did with Earthbound Zero on the Wii U,
4100000	4102000	although obviously this is a little different, these classics.
4102000	4105000	I'm a little worried about being able to get my hands on one.
4106000	4109000	And yes, I'm well aware Nintendo has said,
4110000	4112000	Oh, don't worry you guys, there's going to be more of them available.
4113000	4116000	It's one of those I'll believe it when I see it sort of things.
4117000	4122000	It's very easy to walk into Target today and find Atari flashbacks, Sega Genesis.
4123000	4125000	It's very easy to find those things still on the shelf.
4126000	4130000	Now, granted, I realize those things don't have the same hype behind them that the Super Nintendo does,
4130000	4133000	although the Genesis was rad too, so I don't understand why everybody's hating.
4134000	4135000	But anyway, I just...
4136000	4137000	Probably because they've released it so many times.
4138000	4142000	I just don't see Nintendo being able to meet that same type of demand.
4143000	4150000	Nintendo fucking loves this scarcity of their stuff and how it makes the lines show up on the nightly news and all this stuff.
4151000	4152000	And I'm not going to buy into it again.
4153000	4156000	I didn't with the Nintendo Classic, I never did get one, and I'm going to pass with that.
4156000	4162000	Congratulations, but I'm not... I didn't have a hookup like you guys did, and I'm just not...
4163000	4164000	There's only certain links I'm going to go to.
4165000	4167000	I'm just trying to figure out what possibly they could, aside from like,
4168000	4169000	Okay, look, Nintendo's popular.
4170000	4173000	People know who Nintendo is, it's not like they don't know what Nintendo is.
4174000	4177000	What's a Nintendo? What are they trying to accomplish?
4178000	4179000	All they're doing is frustrating their base.
4180000	4182000	I mean, these are people that are fans of this stuff that are looking to buy it,
4182000	4188000	to maybe even share it with their children, to get younger kids interested in these games.
4189000	4195000	And they're pulling this dick shit that they've been doing since the Wii. It's ridiculous.
4196000	4201000	Granted, these same people can also find an NES at the flea market and get an EverDrive.
4202000	4204000	Or you could, hypothetically, buy the NES in the cartridges.
4205000	4206000	Or get the AVS.
4207000	4209000	Although the original NES doesn't run on HDMI, these things do.
4209000	4211000	So there is, you know, you can't...
4212000	4213000	It's a convenient package.
4214000	4215000	It is a convenient package, yes.
4216000	4217000	But I'm at the mindset that I am with the NES Classic.
4218000	4220000	If Nintendo wants me to have one, I'll get one.
4221000	4222000	And I'll be happy to buy it.
4223000	4225000	And yes, the game collection in here sounds pretty fucking awesome.
4226000	4229000	Sure, I could put together a Raspberry Pi in an emulator and do all that shit.
4230000	4231000	Sure, I could do that.
4232000	4234000	But I think if that's your instant response to these types of things...
4235000	4236000	Right here, this is my fucking response if I can't find one.
4236000	4238000	I already have a fucking Raspberry Pi.
4239000	4241000	I just need to fucking load Retro Pi on it.
4242000	4247000	But it's one of those things where it would be nice to have the official hardware with the official control and all that stuff.
4248000	4251000	That is nice to have and I'm willing to pay that if Nintendo wants me to have one.
4252000	4254000	But if Nintendo doesn't want me to have one, then I'm not going to get one.
4255000	4257000	I like the front end. I wish someone would dump that. Then I really don't need one.
4258000	4259000	But I want to make this clear, too.
4260000	4261000	Since I'm on rants tonight, how about another one?
4261000	4267000	Fuck scalpers. Fuck scalpers. Fuck scalpers. Fuck you if you're a scalper.
4268000	4271000	Don't fucking buy from scalpers because that encourages them.
4272000	4277000	And I'm going to tell you right here and now, that is one thing that I am not going to do is buy from a scalper.
4278000	4280000	And I really wish you all would make that same promise with me.
4281000	4286000	You're not going to fucking buy one of these from a scalper because that is just going to drive the cost of these things up online.
4287000	4290000	That drives the scarcity to them. It is not fucking worth it.
4291000	4297000	It's $80 now. It's not worth it to pay more than that, I think. I mean, it's worth $80. I'm not going to pay more than that.
4298000	4304000	I will steal the games and put them on a Raspberry Pi. You can quote me on that.
4305000	4315000	I will steal. S-T-E-A-L. Steal the games and put them on a Raspberry Pi before I will buy from a scalper. Period.
4315000	4324000	If that's what Nintendo wants me to do, then I will steal the games and put them on a Raspberry Pi before I will buy from a scalper.
4325000	4333000	But fuck scalpers. And if everybody listening to every gaming, not this one because we don't have an audience, I can't imagine why.
4333000	4349000	But if everybody out there listening to every gaming podcast, watching every Twitch stream, watching every YouTube out there would make the same promise to fuck scalpers and this is not that important, then we would not have these problems.
4350000	4362000	So please, everybody, say it with me. Spread the word. Let your friends know. Scalpers end now. Done. Fuck scalpers. Steal instead.
4363000	4368000	And remember, Star Fox 2 will be leaked to the internet immediately.
4369000	4376000	Yes, it will. Alright, anyway, the views and opinions expressed on Renaissance Radio. Anyway, alright, blah, blah, blah, disclaimer.
4377000	4386000	Let's see, going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com. ActDeaf says, I don't want a Raspberry Pi. I want a Super Nintendo Mini.
4387000	4397000	It's cool to have that whole little package. It's nice to have the official controller and all that other stuff. In an officially licensed Nintendo product, I think that would be really cool.
4397000	4405000	ActDeaf in chat says, I know a scalper. Well, fuck that person, him or her. ActDeaf says, I bought my NES Mini from a scalper.
4406000	4413000	ActDeaf, I say this with love. I know you're a long time supporter of the show. You have to realize you contribute to the problem when you do that.
4414000	4420000	Now, I'm giving you a little more of a pass than I would give other people because I realize you live in another country.
4420000	4431000	And with that brings its whole other slate of issues that goes with that. So, for that reason, I'm willing to be a little less harsh on you than I would be on other people.
4432000	4436000	But you have to understand, we have to draw the line on these scalpers. Period.
4437000	4450000	When are we going to say to ourselves, we're contributing to this culture? Our need to have it and we've got to have one under our tree at Christmas and all this stuff and I've got to have something my friends don't have.
4451000	4454000	When are we going to recognize that that is what causes these issues to happen?
4455000	4465000	Just remember, Nintendo could easily put out virtual console games. It's been out on other systems. I'm not sure what the holdup is now. Why are they dicking us around like this?
4466000	4474000	Alright. Come on gumshoos and chat says Rob Roberts came to slay today. I've had two weeks to build this shit up, so here we go. Alright.
4475000	4481000	Anyway, let's move on before I go on more rants. Loki, I think you should talk about a game I've never played. That way I can't rant about it.
4482000	4493000	Alright, fine. So, let's see. Let's talk about Player Unknown Battlegrounds. You know, a game that they feature very briefly during the whole E3 press conferences.
4493000	4501000	But, of course, very popular amongst Twitch streamers and that type of thing. Of course, it is in early access. It's been out since March.
4502000	4514000	But, it is going to be coming to consoles very soon. Microsoft, they showed it off during their conference and one of the things that they're talking about is hoping to develop cross platform play.
4515000	4529000	And, of course, it is coming to Microsoft, but it's also coming to Sony systems as well. So, at least the Microsoft side I'm sure will work fine, but Sony, I don't know.
4530000	4539000	They said cross network play between PC and console is definitely something we want to work to down the road. We don't anticipate we'll have any technical issues with that.
4539000	4549000	If we're going to allow players to use controllers, we need to have aim assist added in and things like that. We're not going to be supporting it right away, but it's something we'd like to look into later on.
4550000	4556000	I mean, it looks interesting. It looks like an interesting game. I play with controller. I don't do the mouse and keyboard crap.
4556000	4570000	But, yeah, it is an issue now, especially when all these good games come out that want to do this cross platform play. Microsoft's willing to play ball and Sony is just kind of doing this.
4570000	4587000	And, once again, the quote Jim Sterling, you know, Sony has put, or briefly, to summarize it, Sony is putting themselves in a position where people are going to look at Sony and they're going to realize that when you buy a game on Sony's platform, you're not getting the full game.
4588000	4598000	You are going to be missing features from that game, whether it be full supports for modding in Bethesda games or cross platform play in other games.
4598000	4608000	Yeah, Sony needs to really figure this out because it's not a good look on Sony right now. The fact that it looks like they're standing alone.
4609000	4611000	Or even backwards compatibility. Let's go there too. Backwards compatibility.
4612000	4621000	It does scream arrogance a little bit on the cross platform stuff, but I'm hoping it's just a big misunderstanding from a legal standpoint and they will work it out before Christmas.
4621000	4636000	And we can play Rocket League, just like we play Final Fantasy XIV, and we can play this Player Unknown as well. Would be nice. Even though it's not a game I have particularly played a lot of, or at all really, I'm just terrible.
4637000	4640000	It's all like a first person, it's like Battle Royale, but a first person shooter, right? That's what this game is, right?
4641000	4642000	Yeah, it's like, you know.
4643000	4648000	I'm just, I'm not usually good at first person shooters, but I should check it out, at least.
4648000	4654000	It's like DayZ with, you know, no zombies. I don't think there's zombies in that game.
4655000	4656000	No zombies?
4657000	4658000	I'm pretty sure there's no zombies.
4659000	4660000	You can't send a horde of zombies in to kill people?
4661000	4669000	No, it's basically, it is like Battle Royale. You start out with a lot of people and you whittle it down to a few. But I mean, it looks neat.
4669000	4678000	Alright. Well, moving on and talking about the backwards compatibility of Xbox games on Xbox One, and of course Xbox One X.
4679000	4685000	One of the big things that they unveiled at E3 this year was that original Xbox games are going to be backwards compatible, at least a selection of them.
4686000	4689000	It doesn't mean the whole, all of them are going to be backwards compatible, but some of them will be.
4690000	4698000	Do realize, and Xbox has clarified this week, that modern features like achievements and widescreen resolutions, not going to be a part of this.
4699000	4706000	I hope you all know what you said about achievements not being important because the original Xbox games are not going to have them because they didn't originally.
4707000	4712000	So they're not going to go back and suddenly add them into the game. They're more focused on getting the game to actually work.
4713000	4722000	That also goes with widescreen support because many of these games, being that the Xbox was the same generation as PlayStation 2, many of these games didn't have widescreen support.
4722000	4731000	Some of them did, like the later Xbox games did and the later PlayStation 2 games did too, but you have to realize some of the games will not suddenly have this in.
4732000	4738000	So you may be playing games with black borders and all that, but hey, at least it's still backwards compatibility, and I think that's okay.
4739000	4744000	Same thing with the PlayStation games and that whole thing. If that's what's holding it up, who cares?
4745000	4750000	Let the PlayStation 1 games be backwards compatible on PlayStation 4 with black borders and no achievements. Fine.
4750000	4754000	But anyway, that's what's going to happen with the original Xbox games as well.
4755000	4759000	Phil Spencer said this all, by the way, on Twitter in a response to some tweets, saying, quote,
4760000	4768000	Most OG Xbox games didn't have widescreen. Can't really easily change the frame buffer aspect ratio on a shipped game from backwards compatibility.
4769000	4773000	We run the OG code so the game will support what the original game supported.
4773000	4782000	So there you go. I think that is to be expected and I'm really, it's weird because this particular article I'm looking at on a website here says,
4783000	4790000	It's certainly disappointing, but I don't, what were you expecting? Like, they're not going to go back and necessarily reinvent all these old games.
4791000	4801000	So I don't think it's disappointing at all. I think it's great that they are allowing you to use these games that are almost 15 years old at this point and still use them on your Xbox One.
4801000	4805000	I think that's great that they're even allowing that at all. So there you go.
4806000	4814000	But you should also again anticipate it's not going to be your entire library of OG games. It wasn't on the 360 either, right?
4815000	4820000	Like DDR never was backwards compatible, like UltraMix and all that. You still can't play those games on the 360.
4821000	4828000	So I would imagine those games are going to be out for Xbox One X. The only games confirmed so far are Crimson Skies and Fusion Frenzy.
4828000	4834000	That's it. But Crimson Skies is a big one and the original Fusion Frenzy I know had a lot of fans as well.
4835000	4840000	Sequel is garbage. Yeah, Sequel is fucking one of the most garbage games I've ever played, but the original was pretty good.
4841000	4842000	Moving on, Dark Sakura.
4843000	4857000	Well, BioWare is still being terrible to us. There is some DLC that BioWare was going to be putting out that apparently was cancelled.
4858000	4874000	However, that was, it was half a hoax, but it was in the end correct that there was going to be no single player DLC update that comes out.
4875000	4884000	So that is really disappointing. We're not going to get any expanded content, not like any of the other Mass Effect games had.
4885000	4887000	This game got sold, this game got done so dirty.
4888000	4889000	Why do you think I'm so pissed off about that new game?
4890000	4901000	Well, you know, I have to confess something to you, Dark Sakura. When we were having our E3 breakdown show a couple weeks ago, you were talking about how you were upset about Anthem because of everything with Mass Effect.
4902000	4908000	And I'm going to admit to you that at the time, because after looking at all the footage, I was like, okay, this Anthem thing looks like it's pretty cool and all this stuff.
4908000	4918000	I didn't say this at the time, but I kind of thought you were being irrational about the whole thing because I kind of thought that, you know, I was like, there are two different games and all this sort.
4919000	4928000	But I'm telling you this now because after reading this story and some of these other things that have come up about Mass Effect, I might kind of be there with you.
4929000	4931000	This is exactly what I thought was going to happen.
4931000	4938000	I'm so upset about how dirty this game got done.
4939000	4945000	And I realized that the game had issues. So did the original Mass Effect.
4946000	4949000	And that game had its chance to grow and get nurtured and all this other stuff.
4950000	4966000	But now the fact that it's like, we're just going to fucking throw this in a hole in the ground and bury it and move on to this other hot new shit we have in town is kind of upsetting to somebody that's, you know, spent so much time on these games over the years and really embraced the culture and all that stuff.
4966000	4978000	So my point of the story is Dark Sakura, in a way, I guess I'm sorry for a feeling I never told you I had, but the more this is going on, I kind of, I'm getting in a similar boat.
4979000	4984000	Like, why should I support BioWare's new IP when the same thing could just happen to that?
4985000	4991000	Well, here's the other thing, too, is that they also basically tabled the plans for a sequel to Andromeda.
4992000	4993000	It's unfortunate.
4993000	5000000	So it makes me want to get people out on a, I don't know, a Twitter campaign or something.
5001000	5003000	But they have to know how people feel.
5004000	5011000	But if it was enough to make them change the ending for Mass Effect 3, it could happen again. And this is something that's worthwhile.
5012000	5013000	Well, I think it's worth getting antsy about.
5014000	5020000	Honestly, Dark Sakura, you know, to bring it back full circle, I think the best fan campaign would be to not buy Anthem.
5020000	5027000	I'm not going to buy it. I'm going to buy the new Dragon Age because that's continuing the series.
5028000	5033000	I'm not ready to completely say I'm not going to buy Anthem yet, but I just have to say this.
5034000	5039000	The whole thing just feels like a kick in the balls or cooter, you know, whatever.
5040000	5048000	I just have to say that I'm not as enthusiastic about this because I just feel like BioWare, like, really, like, fucked over my friend.
5048000	5053000	You know, so why do I want to go support them on this new endeavor? I'm not really excited about that right now.
5054000	5062000	Let's see. Dungeonbuster in chat says, if the story of its development was true, it was a huge mess of a project.
5063000	5068000	And that's, like, when is the management going to take responsibility for how hard they fuck this game?
5069000	5073000	You know, that's another big part of it as well. And these are the people that are now working on Anthem, right?
5073000	5084000	Let's see. SH2100Matt says, I've never seen a franchise torched and the fan base slapped in the face harder than this. It's frustrating. Yeah, it is.
5085000	5092000	So anyway, it's one of those things where maybe I'll get over it by the time Anthem comes out, but I don't know.
5093000	5099000	Right now, I just feel like there's a hundred other games to play from companies that will be supporting the games.
5099000	5110000	Well, I went out on a limb and actually just made it a tweet. To Bioware, I am not going to buy Anthem because of how badly you treated Mass Effect.
5111000	5115000	And I'm going to stand by that. I don't see any point.
5116000	5125000	If you had a successful franchise, you could have made it this amazing thing. And it was still really good. I thought it was still great.
5125000	5130000	And that's the problem with this whole thing is that Andromeda is not that bad of a game.
5131000	5133000	I thought it was a really good game.
5134000	5141000	So, anyway. Well, we've talked about that at length already. I don't want to rehash it too much. It's upsetting.
5142000	5146000	You know, everybody out there that listens to this show knows Jamie and I are longtime fans of this series.
5147000	5153000	And this whole fact that they're just selling it up the river to move on to the next thing, it's upsetting. It sucks.
5153000	5157000	I hope it doesn't happen to your favorite game someday.
5158000	5159000	Alright.
5162000	5168000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, talk.
5169000	5170000	Are we going to move on?
5171000	5172000	Please.
5172000	5178000	Alright. Loki, what do you have for us? We'll get to the classic game of the week soon. We'll go back to a time and place when game companies didn't do games dirty like this.
5179000	5180000	Loki, what do you have for us?
5180000	5196000	Okay. So, apparently, the Guillemot family is working on trying to increase their stake in the company of Ubisoft in order to fend off the whole Viacom hostile takeover that they're doing.
5197000	5216000	So, with that, currently, they had 13.6% of the shares with the voting rights of about 20%. And then, of course, in 2015, they had almost 30% of the company's share and about 25% of its voting rights.
5217000	5228000	So, they're working on right now to kind of get that back up to those previous levels in order to have a better standing to kind of stop them from taking over the company.
5229000	5238000	It's really interesting that Ubisoft has kind of made it clear time and time again they do not want this marriage, this takeover, but it's still trying to happen.
5239000	5241000	And this has been going on for over a year, hasn't it?
5242000	5243000	Yeah.
5243000	5244000	This whole talk of takeover.
5244000	5245000	Boy.
5245000	5252000	Yeah, because they, Ubi was actually, they purchased its first stake in Ubisoft in 2015.
5254000	5255000	Dark to see in chat.
5255000	5261000	I'm sorry. Yeah, they own, actually, Ubisoft owns 27% of the company. So, yeah.
5262000	5268000	Dark to see in chat says, I do wish we could get another Rayman game. I mean, a mainline series one, not more Rabbids, lol.
5269000	5276000	Well, if that Mario Rabbids thing does well, that'll put more money in Ubisoft and hopefully prevent this type of takeover. We'll see.
5277000	5280000	Or maybe he'll be in like the next Smash Brothers game or something.
5281000	5293000	Yeah, anything's possible. I could definitely see like if they do a Smash Brothers remaster or whatever, which at this point, if it still hasn't been announced, I think they're just going to do a new Smash Brothers game, which is totally fine, obviously.
5293000	5300000	I would say Rayman or one of the Rabbids has got to be a shoo-in for that. You would think.
5301000	5302000	Yeah.
5302000	5309000	Especially with this Mario Rabbids crossover. But anyway, to be argued at another time when they confirm whatever the future of Smash Brothers looks like.
5310000	5325000	Meanwhile, let's talk about some other stuff with Nintendo, meaning their stance on fan games, because we all know that AM2R got the cease and desist and it turns out, oh, Nintendo was working on their own Metroid 2 remake, it turns out.
5326000	5331000	But that also, you know, Nintendo has shut down Pokemon Uranium. You know, there's been other stuff that's got shut down as well.
5331000	5347000	So what's interesting is that there was an interview that happened at Waypoint where they were actually interviewing Reggie Fils-Aime and they kind of, you know, put him on the spot with some of these questions in regards to why does Nintendo, you know, aggressively, you know, protect its IP and all this stuff.
5348000	5363000	So a question that they asked in this was, which is why wasn't there a chance, I'm sorry, why wasn't there a chance there or even has there been a chance to speak to that, working on the line between fandom and actual creation.
5364000	5370000	To try to work with a fan creator like AM2R's Milton Gloste or other fan creators.
5370000	5379000	And Reggie said, I think there needs to be clarity on what the line is. And in our view, the line is when an initiative crosses from being an homage to something that is monetizing our IP.
5380000	5388000	We allow homages to exist in a variety of different ways. And for me personally, as a fan, before I was an executive, I understand the attraction that you could have to our IP.
5389000	5398000	But when it transitions to something that now you're trying to monetize it, you're trying to sell, you're trying to profit off of it, that's what broaches or breaks through that line for us where we have to claim our IP protection.
5398000	5405000	Now, of course, Waypoint in the interview is thinking the same thing a lot of you were thinking, there wasn't a cost for AM2R.
5406000	5411000	So again, the question posed after that was, that was a game that anyone could download for free.
5412000	5421000	And I think for fans, there was this notion of go talk to that person or go talk to other fan creators to see if there's a way to not kill that project to investigate the ideas that are happening there that are exciting and who knows.
5422000	5430000	And Reggie answered with this, to differentiate this, we've had conversations with entities that started as fans and became more of a business partner.
5431000	5441000	Those conversations happen all the time. But again, when something transitions to a commercial product, and that's what AM2R was, there wasn't a charge, but it was now a commercial product.
5442000	5451000	Interesting distinction there by Reggie that AM2R, sure, it was free, but it was still a commercial project.
5452000	5457000	I mean, look, it's easy to paint Nintendo as the bad guy in this picture.
5458000	5459000	If it competes with our products, we don't like it.
5460000	5467000	In a way. In a way, that's what it is. Because that game started getting all the YouTube and all the Twitch support and all that stuff.
5467000	5478000	So sure, there was no charge for it, but it was sitting right there alongside these other Metroid games and maybe taking some of the attention away from Metroid when now we find out Nintendo's been working on their own thing.
5479000	5489000	You know why they did that? Because it was something that fans wanted versus Metroid Prime Soccer Game, whatever the fuck that piece of shit was.
5490000	5491000	Federation Force.
5491000	5500000	Yes. That's why. Because it wasn't this shitty-ass game that stood in for a mainline Metroid game.
5501000	5505000	It was something that fans wanted. They liked Metroid 2. It was a remake in Metroid 2. Let's do it.
5506000	5513000	And don't get me wrong, I'm sure that they've got to know what people want. I mean, I hope.
5514000	5525000	To be fair, though, again, I don't want to necessarily rehash a topic, but I do think it's a little silly to think that Nintendo doesn't have every right to shut this shit down.
5526000	5529000	Even I kind of get the sense that, yeah, there's a line that's crossed here.
5530000	5540000	But where's the harm in it? I understand that they can shut down, but why can Sega be totally fine with fan games coming out and even promote fan games by including it in a console release of a game?
5540000	5552000	You can acknowledge it's there or even better. Halo. There's a fan Halo game that's being worked on right now, and 343 Industries gave it their blessing.
5553000	5560000	So why can't these companies say, hey, that's pretty cool, and guess what? We've got a game coming out that's pretty cool too.
5561000	5565000	I think it's up to the company to decide whether they want to draw the line or not.
5566000	5567000	Yeah, and they're fucking dicks. I'm sorry.
5567000	5580000	Okay, Loki, if I did a shot-for-shot remake of my favorite movie of all time, Showgirls, if I did a shot-for-shot remake of Showgirls and then I put that up on YouTube and I say, well, it's free, who cares?
5581000	5588000	I mean, wouldn't Universal or whoever was behind distributed that movie, wouldn't they have a case to shut my YouTube down because I used somebody else's script?
5589000	5592000	It's not the original movie, though, Loki. It's not Elizabeth Bird's movie.
5592000	5597000	It's derivative, it's derivative, and it'd actually be under fair use because of that.
5598000	5608000	Even if I did a shot-for-shot remake of Showgirls from the shooting script, every word, Universal will have no case against me because it's fair use. I don't think that's true. I think they would be able to shut it down.
5609000	5615000	I think, I guess there's only one way to find out. Jamie, have you ever wanted to be in a movie?
5616000	5621000	I'm not looking a pole. You don't know shit.
5622000	5624000	Well, she's really good. You get the part.
5625000	5639000	With the fan games, though, it's not, okay, if you want to say if it's a shot-for-shot remake, it's not, so what? The level designs the same or similar. You can't copyright that.
5639000	5650000	It's not, I mean, level design, I guess if you do it exactly the same, maybe you could make an argument there, but I think that Nintendo takes it a little too far.
5651000	5661000	Granted, there's protecting your IP, but then there's Nintendo protecting their IP or Nintendo monetizing videos of their product and thinking that they should get some money from people fanning over their games.
5662000	5666000	Fuck them. I'm sorry. I don't feel any sort of remorse for Nintendo.
5666000	5673000	I've got to get some of these comments out. Bobby Blackwolf in chat says over at live.vognetwork.com, just because one business is okay with it doesn't mean another one isn't.
5674000	5685000	Just because VoG is okay with people distributing our back episodes on their own server, I should say, Bobby, we only know that to be specific to OLR and your show. I haven't pulled the rest of the shows on this.
5686000	5695000	I have a feeling they're in the same camp, but anyway, just because VoG is okay with people distributing our back episodes on their own servers doesn't mean that Twit is. Fair point.
5696000	5703000	I mean, there's also a big difference there in that our shows aren't out to make money, whereas Twit, I believe, is trying to pay bills.
5704000	5707000	But you see, it's a consumer product that you're not charging for, therefore you're evil.
5708000	5715000	Let's see. Bobby Blackwolf goes on to say, so why should people buy the virtual console version if they can get a shot for shot remake of a game on PC for free?
5716000	5723000	ActDef says, so can I make my own fan remake of Time to Car? I wish you would so someone will fucking finish it, ActDef.
5724000	5726000	You can't remake something that hasn't been made yet.
5727000	5736000	So then I can make my own version of Star Fox 2, or I can make my own Mother 3. It hasn't been released, therefore it doesn't exist.
5736000	5751000	No, I get it, Loki. It's frustrating, and especially when you do see that one company lets people get away with it and another one doesn't.
5752000	5754000	It just makes it seem like you're a dick and you're awesome.
5755000	5766000	It's frustrating because it's their fans showing it. They're not trying to release this to say, fuck you Nintendo, I'm going to make a better game than you and I'm going to sell Metroid and make money off of it.
5767000	5774000	They're doing it because they love your game and they're so much in love with your game and that they want a new game to come out and it's just not coming out.
5775000	5779000	So they're like, you know what, I'm just going to make this game because I love this franchise and everything.
5779000	5784000	You see what the YouTube is. I love your products. I want to talk about your products and share these products.
5785000	5790000	And what have you done along the way? You fucking C&D the people making games. You fucking monetize those fucking videos.
5791000	5800000	What are you doing to your fans? This is only going to go so long. Oh, they're going to shorten the supply of a really highly demanded product from your company.
5801000	5804000	What are you doing? Are you fucking retarded?
5804000	5808000	You need to cease and desist this ranting because you're trying to out rant me on tonight's show.
5809000	5816000	That's a given, but you know, I mean, all right, look, look, no, there's another side of this. I want to make sure we get out here. This is important. Okay.
5817000	5825000	So here's another story on a somewhat related tangent is that, uh, Microsoft, there's this game out there called installation zero one.
5826000	5832000	It's a fan made halo game that aims to bring the multiplayer halo experience to all the various PC platforms.
5832000	5839000	Installation zero one is being built in unity five, and they're saying it's the best part of the classic bungee era halo games.
5840000	5844000	It's going to recreate the halo two and three experience, but there's elements of combat evolved and reach in there.
5845000	5855000	The developers stressing they are operating under Microsoft's game content usage rules. All assets were created from scratch or obtained through the unity asset store.
5855000	5862000	Uh, so, uh, they actually ended up, there's actually been a meeting and this was talked about on the installation zero one website.
5863000	5867000	They had a Skype call with three, four, three industries who is of course now behind halo.
5868000	5883000	And, uh, they stated through these interactions, we've been ensured that installation zero one is not under imminent legal threat provided we remain non-commercial in nature and scope and continue to follow Microsoft's game content usage rules to the letter.
5883000	5889000	So they will never be accepting donations. They will not be selling it or halo related merchandise.
5890000	5894000	That is to keep a respectful distance between us and Microsoft's intellectual property.
5895000	5899000	And fine, put out some like as Bobby likes to try to point the counterpoint there for myself.
5900000	5904000	Hey Nintendo, we're going to take all your characters and worlds and make our own games with it and you have to be okay with it no matter what.
5905000	5909000	We're fans. Then you know what? Fuck Nintendo, have them put out some guidelines in so we can make our own fan games.
5909000	5916000	Because honestly, let's be honest here. If the guideline is don't, here's my guideline.
5917000	5921000	Nintendo, if I wanted to make a fucking fan game guideline, I gave you the guideline.
5922000	5928000	Here's how you fucking do it. You don't be dumb and show your progress. You've make the game, you finish it, you throw it out there and say, fuck them.
5929000	5933000	Where are they going to take it down? It's on the internet. That's what you do. That's how you release a fan game.
5933000	5943000	Give the finger and run. No, seriously. Put that shit on fucking torrent sites. What the fuck are they going to do? C and D torrent sites? No.
5944000	5949000	They can try. It's on the internet. They don't know how the internet works anyways. My god. Sue me.
5950000	5953000	They're like, internet? How do we get that? We need to sue this internet.
5954000	5958000	Just get Nina Bonina Brown to put out your game. Sue me.
5958000	5966000	Sue me. Walk off dramatically. Alright, anyhow, let's go back to a classic time in gaming.
5967000	5971000	This is just, oh, this is so, the vapors, the vapors. This is a very exhausting show tonight.
5972000	5975000	When I didn't have to go to work. I could call in sick to school.
5976000	5986000	It's the classic game of the week where Dark Soccer is going to walk into the gaming vault and hopefully we won't get seized and desisted over the audio we're about to play from this classic game in the archives.
5986000	5989000	Good one. Really good one tonight. Real classic tonight.
5990000	5995000	I was going to use it before and then I found other things to use. Yes. So I saved it for tonight.
5996000	6001000	So here it is. The first game of our post-15 year episode. Yep. Alright, here it is.
6002000	6006000	And y'all will probably go like, didn't you do this before? And the answer is, uh-uh.
6007000	6012000	Alright, what is the classic game of the week tonight? Castlevania 3, Dracula's Curse.
6012000	6023000	This is a big one. Yes, it is. Or this one was referred to in Japan as Akuma Jodensetsu, which is Devil Castle's legend.
6024000	6032000	It was the third and final of the games in the Castlevania series that was produced for the NES.
6032000	6039000	It came out in 1989 in Japan and in North America in 1990 and Europe 1992.
6040000	6044000	It actually came out after the release of Super Castlevania 4 in Europe.
6045000	6049000	And we did have of course virtual console releases and all of that.
6050000	6060000	But basically this particular game was a prequel to the original Castlevania game that was set a few centuries before the original game.
6060000	6066000	So it starred Trevor Belmont as the ancestor to Simon Belmont.
6067000	6068000	Bermondo.
6069000	6082000	Anyway, the game that, this one, it returned back to its platform, I would say, roots like the first Castlevania game instead of the action adventure that Castlevania 2 was.
6083000	6092000	But this one is fairly non-linear though. You also had characters who could assist.
6093000	6102000	Like you had Grant who had his stab attack.
6102000	6114000	Although if I do recall correctly on the disc version of this, he had a projectile with his knives, his Grant dynasty.
6115000	6121000	And then you could play as Alucard who could turn into a bat and shoot fireballs.
6122000	6123000	And then...
6124000	6125000	Life goals.
6126000	6128000	Life goals to turn into a bat and spit out fireballs.
6129000	6135000	But this game was really, I would say, just really in-depth.
6136000	6148000	Oh, and you also could play as Saifa Belnades, who is also in, I think, canon now is considered to be one of the Belmont ancestors as well.
6149000	6150000	But a sorceress.
6151000	6152000	Like magic. Ooh, magic.
6152000	6160000	But this particular game had some very interesting technical differences with it.
6161000	6168000	It had a, in the Japanese version, the original one, it had a VRC6 coprocessor chip.
6169000	6173000	And the game's audio programmer had his fingers in this one.
6173000	6181000	What it did, it had two extra pulsewave channels and a solid channel to add to the initial five sound channels.
6182000	6185000	So it had much better music capability.
6186000	6190000	In the US, the NES didn't have the ability to use external sound chips.
6191000	6198000	So we just had the MMC5 chip, which basically didn't do anything.
6199000	6200000	It was a downgrade of the music.
6200000	6207000	If you ever get a chance to find some of the Japanese music, definitely, definitely look at the Japanese version. It's pretty amazing.
6208000	6215000	Although I do think that now the AVS systems will make use of the external chips.
6216000	6218000	So find yourself a Famicom version of this.
6220000	6225000	In other things, you also had some hidden features.
6225000	6231000	In the North American and PAL versions, you could enter in a code that said, help me.
6232000	6234000	So you could start with ten lives.
6235000	6242000	And with any of the three spirit partners and the more difficult quests unlocked, this was not in the Japanese version.
6243000	6249000	It had, Castlevania 3 had different artwork outside of Japan.
6250000	6252000	It was the first game in the series that did.
6252000	6265000	And the same artist, Tom Dubois, also did the artwork for Super Castlevania IV, Castlevania II, Belmont's Revenge, and Castlevania Bloodlines.
6266000	6269000	So, really, really, really decent work.
6270000	6280000	This is also listed by Nintendo Power as the 9th best NES game that had so many more improvements over it.
6280000	6287000	I honestly, if it wasn't for Dracula X, I would put this at my top of Castlevania games.
6288000	6297000	But, because I don't know, I still kind of think of Symphony of the Night as its own kind of new type of Castlevania game.
6298000	6305000	I still think that Dracula X is the better game that still has the same platforming features like this one did.
6305000	6310000	But, this game is really up there. It is one of the best.
6311000	6321000	It also had, there was a soundtrack that was released with the original Famicom music of it.
6322000	6330000	There was also an animated movie that was in development since 2007 with Warren Ellis writing, for one thing.
6330000	6343000	And then, it finally got its, there was a tease for the animated version, and now we have, the animation is going to be out on Netflix.
6344000	6346000	So, it should be out on July 7th.
6349000	6352000	God, I didn't realize it was that soon. Wow, that's great.
6353000	6356000	So, nice as a little precursor to our Castlevania.
6356000	6360000	Though, I noticed Grant is not listed among the people that they have voice cast.
6361000	6362000	He might be too de-nasty.
6365000	6367000	Or they wrote him out, sadly.
6368000	6370000	Why? He was like one of my favorite characters in it.
6371000	6372000	They gotta say something for Season 2, maybe.
6373000	6374000	As long as they leave Sypha in it.
6375000	6381000	You know what I would want, though, is I would want a Dracula X animated thing. That would just be awesome.
6381000	6391000	Nothing but, but, um, Richter Belmont in his sleeveless 80s with his headband outfit. Hi, I look like I'm Ryu, but I'm in a Konami game.
6392000	6393000	What about animated Silent Hill?
6394000	6395000	Why not?
6396000	6400000	Um, I guess. It's gotta be better than some of those later sequels turn out to be.
6401000	6402000	I did like the movies.
6403000	6404000	I did like P.T.
6405000	6406000	P.T. was great. Rest in peace.
6406000	6413000	By the way, I forgot to say, I have the, um, P.T. Unity on my Mac.
6414000	6415000	Oh, yeah?
6416000	6417000	And it actually is pretty, pretty close and pretty fun.
6418000	6419000	Nice.
6420000	6421000	So, it's still out there to download. People can play it.
6422000	6424000	But, anyway, back to this. Castlevania 3.
6425000	6427000	Akuma Joudensets.
6428000	6430000	I don't, my voice is screwed up right now, so I can't make it sound cool.
6431000	6432000	Is that it?
6433000	6434000	Oh, there it is. Alright.
6434000	6435000	Classic game of the week. Castlevania 3.
6436000	6437000	Dracula's Curse.
6438000	6440000	Now, I must confess, I love this game. Don't get me wrong.
6441000	6447000	And I think I, I think I told you all the story about how I was the guy who figured out first how to get this to work in an emulator.
6448000	6452000	And then the little IRC group I was with put it out there, put the fixed ROM out there for the masses.
6453000	6454000	But, so I do love this game.
6455000	6459000	But, um, Castlevania 2, Simon's Quest, I think is my favorite on the NES.
6460000	6461000	I know, don't, stop rolling your eyes at me.
6461000	6463000	I think it's more of a sentimental favorite, more than anything else.
6464000	6465000	This game is so bad.
6466000	6467000	No, it's not. I love it.
6468000	6469000	Okay.
6470000	6471000	Why do you, why do you hate it so, hater hater.
6472000	6473000	It's a terrible night for a curse.
6474000	6475000	That's right.
6476000	6477000	Grind, grind, grind, grind.
6478000	6479000	It has good music, but it's so grindy.
6480000	6481000	I don't have time for no grinder.
6482000	6483000	Maybe that's the difference between you and I.
6484000	6486000	I don't mind a little grinder here and there, but you got no time for it.
6487000	6488000	Alright.
6489000	6490000	Swipe all you want.
6491000	6492000	So when we come back, there's plenty more show to come,
6493000	6495000	including some stories on Grand Theft Auto, Overwatch,
6496000	6497000	and how about some Dead or Alive as well.
6498000	6500000	We'll get to all that when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
6501000	6502000	Your calls as well, so don't go anywhere.
6503000	6504000	We'll be back after this.
6511000	6515000	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio Live on this Sunday night,
6515000	6520000	July the 2nd of 2017 with episode number 692 of our show.
6521000	6523000	I don't know if we have anybody in Canada who's listening live,
6524000	6526000	but if you are, I hope you all had a great Canada Day yesterday.
6527000	6529000	And I'm sure those of you that are listening on the podcast feed
6530000	6531000	may appreciate a belated happy Canada Day.
6532000	6534000	And of course, to everybody in the United States,
6535000	6536000	we have the 4th of July coming up,
6537000	6539000	so I hope you all have a great and safe, of course, 4th of July.
6540000	6542000	I hope no idiot sets off a firework too close to you.
6543000	6544000	I don't know about you guys,
6545000	6547000	I've already been setting them off all week long here,
6548000	6550000	and I'm already over it, but you know,
6551000	6553000	fireworks aside, the 4th of July is certainly an important day,
6554000	6556000	so yeah, I hope you all have a great holiday.
6557000	6559000	It is kind of weird what it's doing to this work week, though.
6560000	6561000	I don't know about you guys, I have to work Monday,
6562000	6563000	then I have Tuesday off, then I have work the rest of the week.
6564000	6566000	It's a little weird, but whatever. I will take a day off.
6567000	6568000	Do you guys have any exciting plans for 4th of July?
6569000	6570000	I don't want to be around other humans,
6571000	6572000	so I'm going to stay in the cats shuttering at the fireworks.
6573000	6574000	So you'll have an introvert day, basically.
6575000	6577000	Nothing wrong with that. I may actually do the same thing.
6578000	6580000	I'm thinking maybe it might be a good movie day, if anything,
6581000	6584000	but otherwise Hubs and I don't really have any plans.
6585000	6586000	Spider-Man is coming up soon,
6587000	6588000	but I think that's not until Friday, though.
6589000	6591000	Yeah, I think it's before the weekend or something.
6592000	6593000	I still need to see Wonder Woman,
6594000	6595000	but I figure that's in a theater still somewhere.
6596000	6597000	I want to go.
6598000	6599000	I haven't seen it yet.
6600000	6601000	You still haven't seen it? It surprises me.
6602000	6603000	Do you hate DC that much? I'm just kidding.
6603000	6607000	No. When we tried to go before, there was a crazy line,
6608000	6609000	and I didn't want to deal with that many people.
6610000	6611000	Gotcha. That makes sense.
6612000	6614000	Bobby in chat says Rob's going to livestream on Twitch all day.
6615000	6617000	I might. If the movie thing doesn't end up happening,
6618000	6619000	maybe I'll play something.
6620000	6621000	You can watch Summer Games done quick.
6622000	6623000	I can, but I think we're going to get to that in just a little bit.
6624000	6626000	A little more on that as we get into some rapid-fire news.
6627000	6628000	So let's get to it. Loki.
6628000	6634000	Alright, so Blizzard finally announced the date for the StarCraft Remastered.
6635000	6639000	That's going to be coming out on August 14th on PC for $14.99.
6640000	6644000	And of course it has the upgraded graphics, the expansion, Brood War,
6645000	6652000	also Ultra HD and 4K support, matchmaking, leaderboards, all that fun stuff.
6653000	6654000	Remastered music.
6654000	6664000	So look for that, and the price, that's definitely better than, say, $40 for a standalone version of Call of Duty Remastered.
6665000	6666000	Modern Warfare.
6667000	6675000	And then of course, with that, PlayStation Plus and Xbox Live games with gold.
6676000	6679000	Lots of freebies for the month of July, so starting off with PlayStation Plus.
6680000	6682000	This month we get Until Dawn, which is pretty awesome.
6682000	6685000	Game of Thrones, the telltale game.
6686000	6688000	And then of course on PlayStation, those are on PlayStation 4.
6689000	6693000	PS3 gets Tokyo Jungle and Darkstalkers Resurrection.
6694000	6699000	And then on Alveda, Elemental 4 looks like 41 or 4L.
6700000	6704000	And Don't Die, Mr. Robot, which is cross-buy on PlayStation 4.
6705000	6706000	Sweet.
6706000	6716000	And then they also said that along with that, that That's You, which is, I guess, that new party game that they showed off.
6717000	6718000	No, it's you!
6719000	6724000	Yes, will be free to all PlayStation Plus members from July 4th to October 24th.
6725000	6726000	Oh, that's cool.
6727000	6728000	So that'll be something that's coming as well.
6729000	6730000	Yay, free game.
6731000	6732000	So hey, that's pretty cool.
6732000	6739000	That's a sweet lineup for July, because I don't know how long Shane's been begging me to buy Until Dawn and stream it, which, you know, I hate those jumpy scare games.
6740000	6743000	But now it's free, so it's pretty hard to say no to free.
6744000	6753000	Yes. On the Xbox front, we've got starting July 1st, you can get Grown Up, and that's on Xbox One.
6754000	6760000	And then, of course, they have Kane & Lynch 2 Dog Days on Xbox One, or 360, of course.
6761000	6768000	That's until July 15th, and then from July 16th through the end of the month, or I'm sorry, into August 15th, you can get Runbow.
6769000	6777000	And Lego Pirates of the Caribbean will be on Xbox One, Xbox 360 from the middle of the month to the end of July.
6778000	6782000	Nice. Free games, asterisk, if you pay a yearly subscription fee.
6783000	6784000	But still.
6785000	6787000	It's better than one or two console, er, virtual console games.
6788000	6789000	Stop being shady. Alright.
6790000	6797000	Let's talk about, speaking of the Switch, and what it kind of has instead of virtual console right now, it has those Neo Geo games, right?
6798000	6804000	The ACA Neo Geo, which I did buy, I forgot to mention it during my gaming week, but I did pick up Magical Drop 2 came out on Switch this week.
6805000	6808000	And I like those games, as far as the puzzle-y type of games go.
6809000	6811000	Surely you know the Magical Drop games, right, Dark Sakura? Are you a fan?
6811000	6814000	Yes. I have one of them for Neo Geo CD.
6815000	6816000	Oh, nice. I didn't even know they released it on CD.
6817000	6821000	Well, Magical Drop 2 came out on Switch this past week, so I downloaded that.
6822000	6826000	Because I thought that would be a good game, because I think it's also on PlayStation 4 and probably Xbox One as well.
6827000	6832000	But I thought that would be a good one because you can play it on the TV, or you can pick it up and go and play it with other people and all that stuff.
6833000	6834000	So I thought that would be a good one.
6835000	6838000	Well, there are more Neo Geo games confirmed that will be coming to Switch.
6838000	6843000	And this is all part of a Nico Nico livestream that happened, part of the Arcade Archive series.
6844000	6853000	Games confirmed, I mentioned during the series, Samurai Showdown, Super Sidekicks, King of Fighters 2000, Arrow Fighters 2,
6854000	6860000	and probably my favorite Neo Geo fighter they ever did, Fatal Fury Special is coming out as part of that as well.
6861000	6863000	Which is basically Fatal Fury 2+, is what that is.
6863000	6868000	Fatal Fury 2, but with all the one characters that you couldn't play in that game, now playable.
6869000	6870000	Like Tung Fu Ru and Duck King and all that.
6871000	6874000	So I will definitely be picking up Fatal Fury Special.
6875000	6879000	But we don't know exactly what day, we just know they are coming in the coming months.
6880000	6881000	That's it. The future.
6882000	6886000	By the way, speaking of free games, over in chat at live.vognetwork.com,
6887000	6891000	Ragenator is saying, remember, Yaris was free. Could you say no to Yaris?
6891000	6897000	Alright look, maybe not every free game is awesome, but the That's You sounded kind of neat.
6898000	6902000	Our pal Slidekick from Game Buoy is in chat saying, Runbow is a delight.
6903000	6908000	I have not checked out Runbow, but I will check it out since it is available as part of this Xbox Gold stuff.
6909000	6913000	Speaking of the Switch, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe got an update this last week.
6914000	6918000	It is now on version 1.2. Some more Amiibo functionality included with this.
6918000	6922000	That's what I was, I forgot I played another game. Mario Kart 8.
6923000	6925000	Oh did you, on Wii U? Or did you actually play the Switch version?
6926000	6927000	I played the emulator version.
6928000	6929000	Oh you.
6930000	6933000	I own it! I can fucking do that if I want to. I have the disc version.
6934000	6935000	You do own it?
6936000	6938000	I have the digital download, so I played it on my PC and it runs fantastic.
6939000	6943000	You do, you do. Alright anyway, so now in 1.2 of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe,
6944000	6947000	you can use Pikmin Theme Amiibo to unlock a Pikmin suit for the Mii Driver.
6948000	6952000	Race rules and course name are on loading screens during online and wireless play.
6953000	6958000	That's kind of nice because that Cops and Robbers game, I had no idea what the hell that was about until I finally got in and played that.
6959000	6964000	If you're behind in an online match, you will get items geared towards catching up more frequently.
6965000	6972000	I wonder how that's going to affect the shine grab game because that seems like it's always over in a heartbeat as soon as somebody can hold onto that shine for just a few seconds.
6973000	6980000	Some other stuff, if you use an item right after the Super Horn in an online match, the item will remain available for other players.
6981000	6982000	I guess there was a bug before that.
6983000	6985000	And the item wheel will no longer spin continuously in online matches.
6986000	6993000	Online matches will end as intended 30 seconds after the first place racer finishes, so no more trolling in that case.
6994000	6999000	And communication errors no longer occur frequently while spectating or after spectating online matches.
6999000	7005000	I hope that fixes some of the same room gaming problems I was having when JD and I were trying to play Mario Kart a couple weeks ago.
7006000	7007000	That would be very nice to have that fixed.
7008000	7010000	DarkSakura, what do you have for us in rapid fire news?
7011000	7020000	Well, we had mentioned in part one about the Castlevania series that's coming out on Netflix in a few days, really.
7020000	7034000	But they've listed a voice cast. We have Graham McTavish who played Charlie Cutter in Uncharted and Dwalin in The Hobbit.
7035000	7042000	We have Richard Armitage as Trevor Belmont. We have James Callas from Battlestar Galactica as Alucard.
7042000	7049000	And Alejandra Reynoso as Saifah Benades. And there's a full list that's out there online.
7050000	7059000	And then in other news, which was actually going on when I left my house, we have Summer Games Done Quick is going on right now.
7060000	7067000	I sat and watched part of the Halo speedrun, which I like seeing people glitch through games.
7067000	7077000	You have your time to donate right now and say if you want to save the frames or save the animals. Go for it.
7078000	7082000	I think when we left, we were watching, they were just about to start Luigi's Mansion.
7083000	7089000	And then right now, they should be doing Castlevania Symphony of the Night with no glitches.
7090000	7098000	Oh, cool. Well, the good news is if you're listening to OLR and you're missing that, although I know a lot of you will bring that up as your video and then you're listening to us as audio, which is really cool if you're doing that.
7099000	7103000	But everything is put on YouTube after the fact. So if you miss anything, you can always watch it later.
7104000	7112000	Well, at 9 o'clock Pacific, they're going to be doing Wakamele Gold Edition 100% run and then Okami HD at 1030. So that's just today.
7112000	7120000	Tomorrow, well, actually, I may stay up for this one because it'll be the 12 a.m. one. They're doing the 2014 Strider.
7121000	7127000	Oh, cool. For an 80% finish run. And I would really love to see that one. So I think I'm going to stay up for that one.
7128000	7129000	Man, I want to play the NES Strider again.
7130000	7133000	3.04 a.m. is Super Adventure Island 2. There's some good ones on here. There's Actraiser at 4 a.m.
7134000	7137000	Why are they doing some of these early in the morning? I don't know.
7138000	7139000	Yeah, they do some of the worst times.
7140000	7141000	Sonic CD at 1.47 p.m. tomorrow.
7142000	7148000	There's an ad over at Live.VogueNetwork.com says they have a donation incentive for which region soundtrack for the Sonic CD remaster run.
7149000	7150000	Donating.
7151000	7152000	Japan is winning by a landslide.
7153000	7154000	It's because everyone has good taste.
7155000	7156000	You better get in there before Bobby Black Wolf.
7157000	7158000	Unless he wants to donate like $20,000.
7159000	7160000	Hey, it's all towards a good cause.
7161000	7163000	Just don't read your future tomorrow at 1030. Astol at 12.44 a.m.
7164000	7165000	I love Astol.
7166000	7167000	I love Astol. That's a good game.
7168000	7171000	Other good ones, I Am Bread at 5.45 on the 4th of July.
7172000	7175000	That's a good game. But I'd watch someone speedrun that thing. It's so frustrating though.
7176000	7182000	Hollow Knight is happening also on the 4th. Pokemon Puzzle League. Pokemon HeartGold or SoulSilver.
7183000	7189000	How do you speedrun Puzzle League? I guess the same way you speedrun Tetris. I guess you just have to be really good at it.
7190000	7196000	Here we go. There are two on this one I'm super happy about. Silent Hill 2 at 9.19 on the 4th. Another reason to stay home.
7197000	7199000	11 o'clock is Resident Evil Code Veronica X.
7199000	7207000	I will say our pal Flaco Jones submits for PT every time and they haven't picked him yet but maybe next time. He's still working on it.
7208000	7213000	3.07 a.m. is Alex Kidd in Shinobi World which has been a classic game.
7214000	7219000	So yeah, there's a lot of good stuff on there and as mentioned in the previous section, Castlevania 3 Dracula's Curse.
7220000	7226000	5.56 on the 5th. Rondo of Blood at 6.46. There's a lot of good games on here. I just need to not go to work.
7226000	7232000	And you never know what you're going to see when you're watching Summer Games Done Quick or the Games Done Quick series.
7233000	7238000	In fact, this was just shared just a little bit ago in our Discord. Our brand new Discord. Look, we're already integrating it into the show.
7239000	7248000	Over in the Orange Lawns Radio channel over on Discord, Tigerclaw actually brought to our attention that during the Battletoads Any% run, a new record was set today.
7249000	7254000	Two seconds shy of the previous record. So, there it is.
7254000	7265000	We're going to have just other games coming up. There's going to be Chrono Trigger, Any% with no wrong warp, A Link to the Past, doing all dungeons with no sword.
7266000	7270000	There's just a really lot of good ones on here. Shantae is on here.
7271000	7277000	I'm sorry, I do want to just clarify before somebody corrects me. This was actually not done as a part of Summer Games Done Quick. I apologize, I misunderstood.
7278000	7286000	It just happened to be the same day that they're doing Summer Games Done Quick. You have other people that are doing fast games in tandem.
7287000	7297000	But a new record was set today by TheMexicanRunner, is the name he goes by online, and he was also the guy who was on a quest to beat every NES game ever made.
7298000	7305000	So, he just happened to do that today, which is why I assumed it was part of Summer Games Done Quick, but it was actually not, but still lots of speedrunning records being set.
7305000	7309000	This one's for you. Super Metroid Low Percent Ice Race.
7310000	7311000	Ice Race?
7312000	7313000	Ice Race. I don't know what that is.
7314000	7315000	Maybe they're only using the Ice Beam.
7316000	7317000	I reckon. Interesting.
7318000	7321000	But yeah, there's a lot of really good. Some of them I'm actually really surprised to see on here.
7322000	7328000	But there's an Earthbound one for Any% with no glitch. And then the finale is called Anyone Still Awake?
7328000	7334000	Anyone Still Awake? Yeah, really good. I may have this running on my second monitor.
7335000	7337000	I always have to watch a Taskbot block, though.
7338000	7339000	Good times.
7340000	7345000	Alright, and hopefully everybody on the couch behaves themselves this year. I hope they all got a little training after what happened last year.
7346000	7347000	Meanwhile, let's move on.
7348000	7349000	I think that was still this year.
7350000	7351000	That was the winner. Sorry, the winner.
7352000	7353000	It feels like it was a year ago.
7354000	7355000	I know, Trump.
7356000	7359000	The world has gone to shit in such a little time.
7360000	7368000	Meanwhile, let's talk about what is in stores this week. What can you find on shelves this week that you can work on speedrunning for the next awesome games done quick?
7369000	7370000	Loki, how about in the US?
7371000	7373000	Not a whole lot, but as we mentioned, That's You is going to be out on PlayStation 4.
7374000	7377000	So if you have PlayStation Plus, which you probably do, you can get that for free.
7378000	7381000	On 3DS, we have Kirby's Blowout Blast.
7382000	7388000	And then on Accel World vs. Sword Art Online on PlayStation 4 and Vita.
7389000	7396000	And Fable Fortune, their card game, that's coming out on Xbox One and on PC.
7396000	7408000	And then, it's a bit of an early tease, but next, the week after that, one week from Tuesday, Final Fantasy XII, the Zodiac Age on PlayStation 4.
7409000	7412000	I'm so excited about that, just to be clear.
7413000	7417000	I'm excited to play Final Fantasy XII all over again, because you know, I haven't beaten it.
7418000	7420000	I got a ways on it when it was originally on PlayStation 2.
7420000	7430000	Actually, I've never played XII. I played the XII spinoff game that was on DS for a little bit, but I didn't play it that much.
7431000	7436000	Alright, let's travel over to Japan and check out the releases over there, which on the PlayStation 4 this week on July the 6th,
7437000	7441000	Gundam Versus is out, as well as Omega Labyrinth Z in a regular and limited edition.
7442000	7445000	Those are pretty much the big releases on the PlayStation 4 this week.
7445000	7453000	The Vita is also getting Omega Labyrinth Z in a regular and limited edition, so Vita is still not being overlooked in Japan.
7454000	7460000	The Switch doesn't really have anything coming out until July the 20th, so we have a few weeks of a break from the Switch.
7461000	7465000	But checking out the 3DS, nah, nothing there either. We get Hey! Pikmin on the 13th.
7466000	7470000	But as far as this week goes, it's still a little bit empty otherwise.
7471000	7472000	How about the UK, DarkSakura?
7472000	7479000	Oh, there's some stuff. We have, it would be great if I haven't lost my place. There we go.
7480000	7485000	So we have on the 4th, Space Plan on, wait, that's May. Sorry.
7487000	7489000	Because it wasn't linked to July.
7490000	7491000	Well, excuse me, Princess.
7492000	7496000	Alright, on the 5th we have Toby, The Secret Mine. That's it.
7497000	7500000	I guess it's a slow week this week.
7500000	7502000	You think? July usually is.
7503000	7508000	I suppose I can count the 9th because this is the next episode. Gorn for PC.
7509000	7511000	Gorn? Gorn. What's Gorn?
7512000	7515000	The Gorn, the release it. Something I won't play.
7516000	7519000	Alright, the release dates are all Gorn.
7520000	7526000	Moving on, let's get to the mailbag. Every week you guys send us emails to participate at orangelaundrader.com.
7526000	7531000	Again, if you want to send an email to our show, participate at orangelaundrader.com is the place to send those emails.
7532000	7535000	And every week we open up the email bag and pull out some of our favorite emails.
7536000	7540000	And since I don't have my email music this week, I was missing it two weeks ago. It fell off my playlist.
7541000	7543000	But you'll get replacement music tonight.
7546000	7548000	It's our list list music. There it is.
7550000	7551000	We only have one email.
7552000	7554000	Alright, participate at orangelaundrader.com.
7554000	7558000	Hi, OLR. It's your friendly neighborhood rage-inator yet again.
7559000	7564000	Considering what's been going on this week in gaming, I thought I'd write in regarding to...
7565000	7569000	Spell the word T-O. How hard is it to put two letters instead of the number two?
7570000	7571000	Now everybody got a rant tonight.
7572000	7574000	Three letters. T-W-O. Relevant topics.
7575000	7578000	And the same goes for three. That's just improper grammar.
7579000	7582000	As you three are probably well aware and may have mentioned earlier in the show,
7582000	7584000	Nintendo has announced that we all...
7585000	7588000	What we all expected that would do sooner or later.
7589000	7590000	They're...
7591000	7597000	Typos. They're giving the Super Nintendo the Mini Classic Edition re-release like they did with the NES.
7598000	7602000	Now I won't regurgitate the details on that seeing as you probably did so well.
7603000	7605000	And I... No. Did so already. Sorry.
7606000	7608000	And I don't want to be redundant, but I will ask you this.
7609000	7611000	Are you excited about it and considering picking it up?
7612000	7613000	I've answered that.
7614000	7616000	No, no, and yes.
7617000	7618000	Picking up what again? Sorry, I missed...
7619000	7620000	The SNES Classic.
7621000	7626000	Well, I wouldn't say I'm a no. If Nintendo wants me to have one, I'll have one.
7627000	7630000	And thank you, Slidekick, but I come for everybody's grammar.
7631000	7632000	I come for you.
7633000	7635000	Sneak into your room and cut up your wigs.
7639000	7640000	Where was I?
7640000	7642000	I'll pick up the SNES Classic Edition if I can.
7643000	7649000	In terms of favorite memories, it's a toss-up between buying the system completely on my own with my own funds, a gaming first for me,
7650000	7656000	being introduced to the fighting genre on the system with games like Killer Instinct, Primal Rage, and the Mortal Kombat Street Fighter series,
7657000	7661000	and also getting my first gaming soundtrack as a pack-in, the Killer Instinct soundtrack.
7662000	7667000	I played the crap out of it and that started my obsession with building my library of game OSTs.
7667000	7671000	The first system that I bought with my own money was a Super Nintendo,
7672000	7678000	and my boyfriend at the time got me a Super Street Fighter II Turbo,
7679000	7682000	and that made me very happy because I really liked Cammy's music.
7683000	7687000	And I bought Kirby's Avalanche on my own, and I still have that same copy of Kirby's Avalanche.
7688000	7689000	So, just saying.
7690000	7692000	I thought I answered this on a previous show, but I'll say it quickly again.
7692000	7697000	I got $200 for my parents for Christmas one year, and I turned right around and I got a PlayStation,
7698000	7700000	and a copy of Crash Bandicoot 2.
7701000	7703000	I think I had to sell some other stuff or something to make the whole money, or I had some other money saved,
7704000	7705000	because that doesn't seem like enough money.
7706000	7711000	But that was what I bought, and my mom was so pissed that that's what I spent the money on that I never got cash again for the Christmas.
7712000	7713000	I love the chat room right now.
7714000	7715000	Why?
7716000	7718000	Because Come and Come Shoes told Slikik, Dark Sacred Shade comes from reading.
7719000	7722000	And then Slikik says, Reading came first. Reading is the real art form.
7723000	7724000	I will read a bitch.
7725000	7726000	Well, how about you read the email?
7727000	7728000	How about I read you for that hat?
7730000	7731000	I love this hat.
7732000	7735000	This hat was on television, almost, in a deleted scene.
7736000	7740000	This hat, this show, RuPaul's Drag Race, that you always quote, this hat was in a deleted scene.
7741000	7743000	I have to say that you were looking quite scholarly with your...
7744000	7745000	Do you like the glasses?
7746000	7747000	...with your Newsboy cap and glasses.
7748000	7749000	That's the only thing I'm going to do. Actually, I think...
7750000	7752000	He's testing out Twitch stream outfits.
7753000	7754000	No, it's not that. I think I'm going to shave my head.
7755000	7756000	Don't do it. Don't do it.
7757000	7758000	You don't want me to do it?
7759000	7760000	No, don't do it. You need something on the side.
7761000	7762000	You really?
7763000	7764000	Yeah. Don't do it.
7765000	7766000	Just when I thought I was going to do it, now you're having me having second thoughts.
7767000	7768000	No, because the shave head thing is just like...
7769000	7771000	There's like nothing left up top. It's got to go.
7772000	7774000	You're not so fuzzless on the top.
7775000	7776000	Don't do it yet.
7776000	7777000	Or get like surgery.
7778000	7781000	Just for you. No, no. First off. First off.
7782000	7783000	Joking.
7784000	7787000	No to chemicals, drugs, surgery. No.
7788000	7792000	This is the way Mother Nature made me and if you don't like it, kiss my big fat ass.
7793000	7796000	Although they do say that it actually does pass down from the maternal genes.
7797000	7798000	Yeah, they're all bald on that side of the family.
7799000	7800000	Yeah, so that's why I'm not having kids.
7801000	7802000	Alright, anyway.
7802000	7806000	Anyway, don't shave your head for at least a year.
7807000	7808000	I'll think about it.
7809000	7812000	As for my second subject, and you can probably guess what it is.
7813000	7820000	DEALS! As opposed to what you already know, the Steam Summer Sale, aka the Shut Up and Take My Money Gavin Fortnite is well underway.
7821000	7826000	I asked you this. Did you look over the sale? Yes, and I bought exactly two things.
7827000	7828000	And one of them wasn't on sale.
7829000	7830000	Actually I bought three things.
7830000	7834000	I bought a Steam Link this time, and I need to talk to you about how you have your setup, Rob.
7835000	7837000	Because yours doesn't have a lag, does it?
7838000	7839000	No.
7840000	7841000	Okay, I need to ask you how you have your setup.
7842000	7843000	Wired. Wired. Okay.
7844000	7845000	To the TV, right?
7846000	7848000	Mm-hmm. But you stream Wi-Fi?
7849000	7850000	No, I stream through a wired connection.
7851000	7853000	You stream through a wired connection? Okay. Alright.
7856000	7859000	Where was I? What are your thoughts on it? It's a fucking Steam Sale.
7860000	7871000	Did you pick up any goodies for yourselves, and what? I got Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2, I bought Danganronpa Ultra Despair Girls, and I got a Steam Link. There you go.
7872000	7878000	Not yet for me, but I probably will have a couple games by the time this is all said and done.
7879000	7883000	But if you want to go look at my wishlist and buy me a belated birthday gift, I certainly am not going to complain.
7884000	7885000	I ordered you pencils. Yay!
7886000	7888000	But they're arriving at my house instead of your house.
7888000	7913000	I did participate in the sale myself, and this may come as a shock to everyone, but I bought six items for roughly $23, two of the newer Pinball Ethics 2 Table DLCs that I was missing, completing my collection now, Burn Zombie Burn, Rainbow Six Vegas 2, Euro Trek Simulator 2, and Serious Sam 3, Jewel of the Nile DLC. In closing, remember to reject false orange bigoted dumbass icons.
7914000	7932000	And I apologize for the Google chat sound that went off while she was reading that email. Why is it, like, I will open that window for like 30 seconds during a show, because I'm trying to check something, and that happens to be the exact 30 second window that I'll get a message. Like, without fucking fail. Sorry guys.
7933000	7935000	That happened on Reading is Fundamental a lot when I was...
7936000	7937000	What about Loki? Did you buy anything?
7937000	7954000	Um, the only thing I bought was Middle Earth Shadow of Mordor, but I... I don't know, maybe I flin hook, that looks pretty sweet. I don't know. There's other games out there, but I'm like, if I'm going to do this game jam, I don't want to be buying new games to play, because that's not...
7955000	7961000	You need to do a game to put on the Steam store for the next sale. You can do it, Loki.
7962000	7965000	Well, if I'm going to make the game I'm making now, it's not going on the Steam store, I don't think.
7965000	7967000	Right, itch.io then.
7968000	7975000	What if there was, like, one based off of Shadow of Mordor, except it was Game of Thrones theme, and it could be Shadow of Hodor?
7976000	7986000	Hey, just don't get sued over it, because if you want to know somebody who's a bigger dick than Nintendo when it comes to properties and licenses, try HBO.
7987000	7988000	Just saying.
7988000	7995000	Alright, come on gumshoos and chat says, Loki's game should just be a rant meter. Could be, maybe.
7996000	8004000	It should be a clicky game called It's Not Loud Enough, and you keep clicking to turn up the volume, and it's never loud enough.
8005000	8019000	Well, just like the original case, since this is not the premise I'm going to be using, the original premise for my clicker game was going to be kind of a cross between a clicker game, work time fun, and WarioWare.
8020000	8031000	So, it was going to be... I don't even know what the purpose was yet, that's the problem, I didn't have a storyline to go along with it, so I didn't want to string a bunch of random shit together.
8031000	8040000	So, it was supposed to be like, you're earning money for some reason, it's like a late night TV thing, and each channel is a different job you're doing.
8041000	8054000	It's really stupid shit, like liking a video on YouTube, like you keep clicking the like button, you know, because they always say smash that like button, so you're smashing that like button, or you're burping a baby, or something that involves...
8054000	8062000	Okay, the story, here's your story, the story could be that you're unemployed, and so you're taking every odd job you possibly can, like you're driving for Lyft...
8063000	8068000	It was supposed to be like Fiverr, like a Fiverr type thing where you're doing a bunch of weird shit.
8069000	8072000	What's that fucking Amazon thing that you can get like 2 cents for taking a survey?
8073000	8074000	The Turk?
8075000	8079000	Yeah, that whole thing. There's that. That's what you could base it off of.
8079000	8088000	That's what it was supposed to be like, but instead it's, I'm doing something totally different from all that, that I think sounds cool. We'll see.
8089000	8093000	Bobby Blackwell says you should do it where you're playing multiple clicker games at once and call it multi-clicking.
8094000	8095000	This sounds very familiar.
8096000	8101000	Here is another one, another one that was hilarious, and this would be the whole joke because I never finished a game.
8102000	8110000	The whole game was going to be about making clicker games, or like adding features to it, and you know how you ascend in the game? You ascend by playing another clicker game.
8111000	8114000	You keep going deeper with it, so you're playing a clicker game within a clicker game within a clicker game.
8115000	8116000	Or you ascend to scrap your project and start again.
8117000	8123000	You're just like, well I'm just going to play this instead, and then you're playing another clicker game that's about making clicker games, and it just keeps getting deeper and deeper.
8123000	8131000	And that was another idea I had, but I didn't run with it. But no, I'm going to try this one first, the one I have that I haven't mentioned anything about, because it's different.
8132000	8136000	And it could be cool, but if not, then maybe I'll go back to some weird shit like that.
8137000	8139000	Click recursions. Start, Tetsuya.
8140000	8144000	Alright, anything else for the email, Dara Sakura? Was that it from Rage Nator, or was there more?
8145000	8146000	That was it.
8146000	8153000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you would like to send us an email for a future week.
8154000	8155000	There you go.
8156000	8161000	Please send us emails. Make Dara Sakura work around here. She gets chocolate after all.
8162000	8163000	I already work.
8164000	8165000	Loki, let's move on to some more news.
8166000	8174000	Alright, so one of the other games I was thinking about actually picking up on Steam because I've been watching, oh god I don't remember the guy's name now.
8174000	8185000	Air Force, I think it's Air Force Proud 95. It's a guy who does a lot of trolling streams in Flight Simulator X. That was the one I was going to look at.
8186000	8190000	Anyways, so let's talk a little bit about one of my favorite games, Grand Theft Auto.
8191000	8202000	And as you remember, there was a whole controversy with modding tools, the fact that OpenIV got a cease and desist, and a big backlash regarding it.
8202000	8211000	Well, there's been an update to that. So Rockstar Games has added a new page to their support site, basically talking about single player mods.
8212000	8228000	So they're saying, are single PC mods allowed? And it says, after discussion with Take-Two has agreed that it generally will not take legal action against third parties involved in Rockstar PC games.
8228000	8242000	They are single player, non-commercial, with respect to IP rights of third parties. And this does not apply to multiplayer online services, tools, files, libraries, or functions that could be used to impact multiplayer online services.
8243000	8253000	Or use of importation of other IP, including other Rockstar IP in the project. This is not a license and it does not constitute endorsement, approval, or authorization of any third party project.
8253000	8259000	Take-Two reserves the right to object to any third party project, revise, revoke, blah, blah, blah.
8260000	8267000	So it sounds like they're kind of saying, no, no, PC mods are still okay, single player mods are fine.
8268000	8272000	And I don't remember if it's a part of this, but I've watched a lot of live streams regarding this.
8273000	8280000	And people are a little bit more in the know that I think they're actually in contact with the OpenIV guys to see if that can get back.
8280000	8287000	Basically saying, listen, as long as you don't do anything with online, you guys are still okay to bring that back.
8288000	8290000	So we'll see if that's the case.
8291000	8299000	Because there's a lot of cool shit you can do with it. I've been watching a lot of different streams where they have different scripting mods and stuff that look pretty fantastic.
8299000	8315000	One of the awesome things that you can do with OpenIV, and I didn't even realize this, they have as part of the OpenIV package, not only can you use it to change the models in game and stuff like that to mod things to look differently,
8316000	8325000	but they have a thing called Open Camera, which is actually a mod to the whole Rockstar editor, so you can use it for filming different things.
8325000	8330000	You're not constrained to the stuff that you have in that editor. You can actually do more of a free cam with it.
8331000	8340000	And with that, one of the things I watched actually today is this movie that they made. It's a short film filmed entirely within Grand Theft Auto V.
8341000	8347000	And it was called Not Normal or something like that. It's fucking amazing.
8347000	8356000	It's absolutely amazing what you can do with this editor. That wouldn't be possible with this kind of ban on this stuff.
8357000	8366000	So I think that they realize that there's a lot of creativity that you can do here, but at the same time, they have to protect their money online, and I don't think people are really opposed to that.
8367000	8372000	So go after the people making cheat devices for online and let OpenIV exist.
8373000	8382000	All right. And then along with that, speaking of mods and stuff, so one of the things that people do with any game, including Grand Theft Auto V, is dig through the code.
8383000	8393000	So apparently some people found in the Gunrunning update, which is the latest update they did for GTA Online, that there's a series of code related to the whole
8393000	8408000	Zancudo military base and UFO crashing. Because remember, everybody's been looking for this hidden Easter egg thing that's about UFOs and stuff in Grand Theft Auto because there's been all these hints towards it, but never really anything coming to fruition.
8409000	8424000	Well apparently though, there is a supply mission that there's some way to trigger it, and it may not be something that's available right now, but they have filmed it triggering, where a UFO crashes and you go capture an alien egg from it.
8425000	8444000	So because it's not finished yet, it's something that may be released later on, and they're not entirely sure what you have to do to trigger the mission. Apparently it's very rare, but it is something that is in the game, so it's kind of neat to see something related to the whole Chiliad Mystery stuff.
8446000	8449000	It's always fun to dig through files and find little secrets.
8450000	8451000	Yeah.
8451000	8463000	Alright, well let's move on to talk about Overwatch and secrets that people are finding on the PTR, although I guess they're not really secret if they are being publicly tested, but there are going to be some big changes coming to Overwatch.
8463000	8473000	There's going to be a new recently captured tab in the highlights menu, so you can actually bind a key to record up to 32 of your own highlights, so that's kind of neat.
8474000	8489000	What will happen on consoles, you can take those clips and download them to the system's native media library, but on PC you can then download them and output them in 4K 60 frames a second on any computer, regardless of the specs. I think that's very smart.
8489000	8490000	That's pretty sweet.
8490000	8495000	That's very similar to what Mario Kart 8 does on Wii U, so strangely enough not on the Switch.
8495000	8508000	Actually going back to the whole Rockstar Editor thing, that's what you can do with that too. If your PC is just kind of ehhh, because it's rendering it later on, it's not in real time, they can do it at much higher resolution than you can do.
8508000	8521000	Exactly, so that Mario Kart TV thing is doing in Mario Kart is it's rendering it, basically not in real, it's rendering it on demand, so everything kind of looks really good in those replays and so forth, and the real nuances that you see.
8521000	8530000	I'll remember Angry Luigi, that whole meme from a couple years ago, right? That was all from the rendering that it does in the game after the fact. So the fact that that's coming to Overwatch, that's going to be awesome.
8530000	8550000	And it always surprised me that that was not a feature you could use for play of the games right out the gate. I was always surprised Blizzard didn't have a way to natively dump those clips. People were using screen recorders and filming it with cell phones and also the garbage, so the fact that they're doing the native exports I think is going to be a really good thing for their game, so that's really smart.
8550000	8563000	Also, and going to our chat over at live.vognetware.com, come on gumshoes and chat says, nice, I really wish I could go back and see some of my play of the match clips, better than earning an achievement, you know, sometimes for sure.
8563000	8581000	Anyway, also with this, loot boxes are going to get some improvement. The rate of duplicates will be drastically reduced. To compensate for this, the lack of currency that would be generated from lack of duplicates, the overall amount of credits that you'll get from loot boxes will increase.
8581000	8605000	I'm happy to hear the amount of duplicates that's going down. I'll never forget that time during the Uprising event, I opened a loot box on PlayStation 4 and I got the awesome D.Va intro, which is great, but I got that D.Va intro, the selfie one where the mech explodes behind her, I got that twice in one box. That's a bit much, don't you think?
8605000	8617000	To get the same thing twice in a box, so I mean, don't get me wrong, I was ecstatic to get that intro, but that might have been a bit much, so excited to hear about that change. DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
8617000	8639000	Well, we're going to have a new fighting game playable at EVO this year. There will be the new fighting game out by Arika, and it is featuring Street Fighter EX characters, Garuda, Kairi, and Hokuto, that was listed in the footage.
8639000	8655000	As we know, Arika did the Street Fighter EX series, which it would be nice, actually, if we got another EX series, that would be really good, but they are teasing it as something for a project.
8655000	8662000	It was actually first brought out on April Fool's, so they thought it was a joke. People thought it was a joke, but it actually is happening.
8662000	8679000	So, for other fighters that are going to be there, it's Gundam vs. Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite, the city of Final Fantasy NT, and Dragon Ball FighterZ, the Trunks build or later. So, there you go, it's in two weeks.
8679000	8682000	Are you going to check it out?
8682000	8686000	Well, yeah, I'm more interested in the Dragon Ball fighting game though.
8686000	8688000	But there's room in your-
8688000	8690000	I like EX, I want Skull-a-mania to come back.
8690000	8693000	There's room in your heart for more than one fighting game, I'm sure.
8693000	8697000	I love Skull-a-mania, and Hokuto, those are like my two.
8697000	8699000	Act Efton Chat says, Evo's going to be awesome.
8699000	8701000	I'm sure a lot of people are looking forward to it.
8701000	8705000	Someone wants to send me a ticket to Vegas. I'll go cover it for OR.
8705000	8712000	Just a few more stories here, and then we're going to get to our Skype line, if you want to call and talk about Evo, or really anything at all.
8712000	8717000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, we'll get there in just a moment, but first, Loki.
8717000	8723000	I don't know what to say about this. It's definitely an interesting time to be alive.
8723000	8729000	Tecmo is making a version of Dead or Alive that you can smell.
8729000	8733000	That's right, they're calling it, and not just Dead or Alive.
8733000	8739000	Dead or Alive Extreme, like as an extreme, extremely fan service.
8739000	8741000	Smell what?
8741000	8743000	I don't know, but Dead or Alive-
8743000	8744000	The beach?
8744000	8745000	It's coming to their, I guess-
8745000	8746000	Coconut Oil?
8746000	8749000	Their VR Sense platform, which is an arcade game.
8749000	8759000	So the arcade cabinet, actually, that this game runs on, has different sensory functions like hot, cold, wind, mist, and smell.
8759000	8766000	Just what we need arcades to smell like, is Dead or Alive.
8766000	8771000	It smells like sex and candy in here.
8771000	8776000	Oh my god, that song from the 90's is relevant again, I can't believe it.
8776000	8783000	Marcy Playground never thought they'd be collecting residuals in 2017.
8783000	8786000	Dear lord, that song is terrible.
8786000	8789000	So I'm guessing that, I don't know, I don't-
8789000	8792000	Lots of coconut oil, I'm guessing, right?
8792000	8793000	No, lots of coke.
8793000	8794000	Or pussy? I don't know-
8794000	8796000	You know, wait a minute-
8796000	8798000	Is that not what I'm supposed to infer?
8798000	8799000	If someone's serving fish-
8799000	8805000	If they're gonna give you the full strip club experience, then I say that they spray glitter on your face.
8805000	8810000	Because, you know, if you're gonna smell like a strip club, at least you have the sparkly glitter that goes along with it.
8810000	8815000	You win, and then the game just sprays you with glitter.
8815000	8818000	I'm just now remembering your story about the strip club.
8818000	8820000	Oh, when I went to the strip club and got a lap dance?
8820000	8821000	Yeah.
8821000	8826000	Because my friends were like, you know, obviously I was, well I've been totally gay my whole life,
8826000	8832000	but, you know, in my early 20s it was like, I guess it was like a thing for my friends to take the gay guy to a strip club.
8832000	8835000	And they said, which one do you think is the hottest?
8835000	8839000	And I said, and I quote, that one because she looks like Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
8839000	8842000	Which is true, she looked a lot like Sarah Michelle Gellar.
8842000	8848000	So of course my friend bought me a lap dance and it was really awkward and everything, and I felt sorry for the girl.
8848000	8850000	Did you tell her that she looked like Buffy?
8850000	8854000	I don't remember if I ended up telling her that I picked her because she looked like Buffy,
8854000	8862000	but I did, she did at the end, she was like, you don't, she could tell I did not, I was not responding to her, right?
8862000	8865000	So she was like, what's wrong? Relax. Are you okay?
8865000	8869000	And I was like, uh, honey, I'm gay. And she said, oh, I thought so.
8869000	8873000	And she sat down next to me and she just, and she's like, oh, my roommate's gay.
8873000	8875000	He's my best friend in the whole world.
8875000	8881000	And she's telling me her life story and all I can think of is like, please put your shirt back on because this is really awkward right now.
8881000	8885000	Did you really want me to tell that story on OLR? Because you got me to tell that story on OLR.
8885000	8887000	You got me to tell that story on OLR.
8887000	8888000	You've said it on OLR before.
8888000	8889000	Have I?
8889000	8890000	Yes.
8890000	8894000	I think it's been a long time. Those are the types of stories I don't like to tell on OLR.
8894000	8899000	Nobody knows to hear about the time when Rob Roberts got boobies in his face. Nobody needs to hear that story.
8899000	8902000	Wait, you know, there is always the 16th anniversary show.
8902000	8907000	Where we go have it at city limits.
8907000	8909000	Is anyone still there?
8909000	8910000	I think it is.
8910000	8915000	What was, what is the, I think it's still as showgirls. Is that the name of it?
8915000	8916000	Showgirls is still there.
8916000	8918000	That was City Limits.
8918000	8920000	No, City Limits is a different place.
8920000	8922000	I thought St. Limits was the one off Auburn that's down there.
8922000	8923000	I don't know.
8923000	8926000	Showgirls I know is still there because they drive past it as I go to the Togo's over there all the time.
8926000	8928000	I would just go for the food.
8928000	8932000	Well, so here's the thing. So here's the thing. So obviously the non-locals have no idea what we're talking about.
8932000	8939000	In California, the law is we have juice bars because there's laws. Are they city laws or state laws? I think they're state laws.
8939000	8945000	The state law is that you cannot have alcohol and titties. Or is it full nudity? It's beaver.
8945000	8946000	It's full nudity.
8946000	8954000	So you can't have that and alcohol in the same place. So that's why you have juice bars. You can get juice and...
8954000	8955000	Or soda, yeah.
8955000	8960000	Or soda or mozzarella sticks, which I want to say, Logie, when I told you that story, I think, didn't you?
8960000	8964000	I swear you were the one that said, oh yeah, they got great mozzarella sticks.
8965000	8970000	However, mozzarella sticks and strip clubs, it doesn't, you don't want to like...
8970000	8975000	Only Logie would be like, oh yeah, that strip club's got great mozzarella sticks.
8975000	8976000	I was hungry.
8978000	8980000	Fried cheese and boobs.
8980000	8982000	What's not to like?
8982000	8984000	Doesn't that sound like a party to our Sakura?
8984000	8987000	I don't know. I'm kind of not into any of that.
8987000	8991000	The fried cheese is a whole hell lot cheaper than the boobs, that's for sure.
8991000	8993000	Moving on.
8995000	8999000	Can we please talk about video games, please? It's been 15 goddamn years.
8999000	9002000	Can I talk about a fucking video game?
9002000	9004000	I wrecked them.
9005000	9006000	Wrecked them? I hardly knew them.
9006000	9010000	All right, Mega Man 4 is the last game I want to talk about tonight.
9010000	9015000	You know, classic video game. When was it? 1991 or 92 when that game came out?
9015000	9022000	Well, here's the thing. Apparently in that game there was supposed to be a mini-boss in Pharaoh Man's stage.
9022000	9025000	But that boss never made it into the game.
9025000	9031000	You could see this boss in an episode of, or an episode, an issue of EGM back in 1991,
9031000	9035000	but hence that mini-boss never actually made it into the game.
9035000	9039000	Well, get this, there's a YouTube that came out this week and it's around the different gaming blogs,
9039000	9043000	and you can finally see that boss in motion.
9043000	9046000	Now, usually this wouldn't be such a big deal,
9046000	9053000	but I kind of like these stories about, like, unearthed things in video games like 20 years after the fact.
9053000	9057000	Kind of related to your Grand Theft Auto alien thing, although that's a little more current,
9057000	9060000	but I like this whole, like, digging into games to find this.
9060000	9063000	And to be fair, this was not digging it. Nobody dug into the Mega Man code.
9063000	9068000	Somebody found, like, an old video footage of somebody playing this at, like, an expo or something like that.
9068000	9071000	So, you know, it was just, it was unearthed in video footage.
9071000	9078000	But, with all the talk about Star Fox 2 coming back, you know, that was promoted in magazines and all this stuff.
9078000	9083000	But, outside of a 90% finished ROM, nobody's ever really got to play Star Fox 2.
9083000	9087000	So, I think it's kind of cool that a lot of these old video game history things are being unearthed.
9087000	9090000	So, I just think that's kind of neat.
9090000	9093000	So, anyway, Dartitsian Chat says,
9093000	9095000	I highly recommend watching this video series.
9095000	9101000	You get to see the behind-the-scenes watching the guys at EGM setting up to get screenshots for the magazine.
9101000	9104000	Yeah, you can actually see them setting up to take a picture and all that good stuff.
9104000	9105000	So, you can check that out.
9105000	9107000	What is the YouTube user that actually did this together?
9107000	9109000	I see the YouTube here. Let me actually go to YouTube.
9109000	9112000	God, this is a 54-minute clip.
9112000	9117000	Robert Hoskin is the individual's name over on YouTube, so you can check that out.
9117000	9121000	Very cool. All right, that's going to do it for the stories that we have slotted tonight.
9121000	9124000	But we're going to open up the Skype line if you have a little more to say.
9124000	9128000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype if you want to give us a call.
9128000	9133000	Meanwhile, I'll check in with Loki while we're waiting for a call to see if we have any last-minute stories, Loki.
9133000	9136000	Apparently, I can't spell normal with one hand here.
9136000	9139000	Okay, thank you for minimizing that window.
9139000	9147000	I was posting a link in the chat for that not normal short film that was done in Grand Theft Auto because they have it on Vimeo.
9147000	9152000	And they also have the behind-the-scenes port, too, where the guy talks about making it and everything, which is pretty interesting.
9152000	9155000	So, definitely go watch that. But a really good thing.
9155000	9164000	Last-minute stories. This is something that's kind of interesting. I'm not sure who to blame for this.
9164000	9168000	But apparently, they uploaded the 4K footage from that whole...
9168000	9175000	Oh, what was that? What was the EA game that you guys don't like because Mass Effect was...?
9175000	9176000	Anthem.
9176000	9184000	Anthem. Yeah, so they uploaded 4K footage of Anthem that was supposedly the PS4 version that they were showing off or whatever.
9184000	9191000	And apparently, it looked like they just pasted PlayStation 4 button prompts over Xbox One button prompts.
9191000	9193000	That's kind of funny. I don't know why.
9193000	9197000	So the thought was, oh, this is Xbox One X footage or something like that.
9197000	9202000	I think it's still running off PC, but who knows? It's interesting, though.
9202000	9209000	I remember way back. My very first E3 was the year they were... I think they were showing off the 360 for the first time.
9209000	9216000	Or maybe that was the second year. I don't know, but I remember in the cabinets were PCs that were playing the 360 games.
9216000	9218000	Yeah, the dev kits were just PCs.
9218000	9221000	It's not uncommon in the gaming world. There's nothing wrong with it.
9221000	9229000	Yeah, but if you're going to upload 4K footage, maybe reshoot that or edit that out or something.
9230000	9233000	Instead of just... whoops.
9233000	9238000	Again, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype if you want to give us a call.
9238000	9240000	Looks like people are being shy tonight.
9240000	9247000	But I also know it's a long weekend, so a lot of people went on vacation and stuff, so we probably don't have quite the same turnout we would usually have.
9247000	9251000	But we were already off last week. We don't want to miss two weeks in a row.
9251000	9255000	A YouTube series I could recommend. I started watching this because somebody recommended it to me.
9255000	9260000	There's a Final Fantasy XIV documentary out there, and I can't remember the name of the YouTube user.
9260000	9263000	Maybe somebody in chat will know what I'm talking about.
9263000	9269000	But it's a whole documentary about the 1.0 and why it was kind of rushed the way it was.
9269000	9271000	And they actually talked to some of the developers on the game and all that.
9271000	9279000	So it kind of talks about the death of 1.0 or actually the fact that they were running 1.0 while they were still making 2.0, essentially.
9279000	9287000	So it was like they were creating this new game but maintaining the old game that they knew they were going to pull the plug on the whole time they were doing it.
9287000	9289000	This is very interesting to me.
9289000	9291000	When's XI coming out of mobile already?
9291000	9293000	That has kind of disappeared, hasn't it?
9293000	9295000	They didn't say anything about it at E3 or anything like that.
9295000	9298000	So, it was weird.
9298000	9301000	Alright, last call for calls. Get in now or don't get in at all.
9301000	9304000	They have a new Final Fantasy XV mobile game.
9304000	9307000	I gotta admit, there's a brand new one that just came out.
9307000	9311000	Yeah, they're all reskins. I swear to God, I've played a lot of these.
9311000	9315000	They're all reskins of each other. There's really only two or three mobile games out there.
9315000	9317000	We have a good friend that worked on it.
9317000	9320000	We should get somebody on the show to talk about it then, hopefully.
9320000	9324000	If they can. Sometimes they're all gag orders and stuff, but anyway.
9324000	9327000	They're all reskins.
9327000	9333000	Well, I know there's a lot out there where they take a popular game and they'll kind of put the property on it.
9333000	9338000	Endless Runners. What was the frickin'? They did one for Temple Run.
9338000	9342000	That was a big game. I don't think that game is that big anymore, but they did a Brave.
9342000	9344000	Disney had a Brave. It was just Temple Run.
9344000	9350000	So, sometimes Angry Birds, Star Wars Angry Birds, and they have the whole Rio Angry Birds thing.
9350000	9358000	Alright, well, it doesn't look like people are calling in, so I guess we're gonna wrap up the show.
9358000	9360000	That's gonna do it for another episode of Orange Lawn Radio.
9360000	9365000	Alright, you shy people. At least you can head on over to the Discord and you can talk to us there on Discord.
9365000	9370000	Leave us some messages. Also, you can always leave us an email any time throughout the week.
9370000	9373000	Participate at OrangeLawnRadio.com or you can always tweet us.
9373000	9377000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R. Sorry I don't always get around to reading those on air
9377000	9382000	just because I have so many windows open when I'm trying to do the show, but I promise I do read all the tweets.
9382000	9387000	If you send something for Jamie or Matt, I will always forward it as appropriate.
9387000	9391000	But for now, it's time for us to wrap up the show and get on out of here.
9391000	9395000	Thank you guys for tuning in tonight. I hope you guys had a fun time on the show tonight.
9395000	9397000	We'll be back to do it again in seven days.
9397000	9400000	If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lawn Radio, please tell a friend or two about the show.
9400000	9403000	Help us spread the word. We are the show where every gamer has a voice,
9403000	9408000	but we can only put those voices out there if they're here to share in the show with us.
9408000	9414000	So, a nice five-star review on iTunes or Google Play or wherever it is you found this show.
9414000	9416000	That goes a long way as well.
9416000	9419000	So, let's go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.
9419000	9425000	I'll start. My final thought for the night is I need to play some more Overwatch.
9425000	9429000	I haven't played in like a few weeks. I'm feeling the itch to play some Overwatch,
9429000	9432000	but darn that Final Fantasy expansion taking all my time.
9432000	9435000	Jamie, I'll let you go next. Your final thoughts tonight?
9435000	9439000	I'm going to go home and play more of the screaming game.
9439000	9441000	I'm sorry, Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2.
9441000	9443000	It's over 9000!
9444000	9451000	You know what? I tried to play it in English, and the good voice actors, don't get me wrong,
9451000	9456000	but when you have started with the series, hearing a particular series of voices,
9456000	9460000	it's really hard to go to anything else. You know?
9460000	9463000	Alright. Loki, your final thought tonight?
9463000	9468000	I guess I'm going to work on my game this week. The new game, apparently.
9468000	9471000	I guess. Maybe.
9471000	9475000	Alright. Hopefully. I hope you actually get it done.
9475000	9477000	Me too.
9477000	9480000	Alright, we are going to do it for another episode.
9480000	9484000	That's it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio. We'll see you in seven days.
9484000	9488000	We'll do it all over again. Have a great week gaming. Enjoy the new stuff that's out this week,
9488000	9494000	and we will see you very soon next week with another edition of Orange Lounge Radio.
9494000	9495000	Good night, everybody.
