00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This week Milwaukee no longer requires augmented reality game companies to obtain a physical permit for a virtual location. So go enjoy the outdoors if it's reasonable. That's just one piece of closure in tonight's gaming news. Stay tuned for the rest of the week's headlines starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Hello my friends and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight on December the 3rd of 2017 with episode number 709 of our show. We're here over the next few hours to talk about video games. Myself, Rob Roberts, you might know me on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E. And over there, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

3
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Hi.

4
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Hi, how are you?

5
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Spiteful.

6
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Spiteful?

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Yeah.

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Good to hear about that.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
What's new?

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Somebody made the mistake of pissing you off.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Yeah, someone I'm related to, so I got dirt.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Those are usually the ones to piss us off first, just saying.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Oh, I got dirt.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I know, I know. We'll get into that later.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Yeah.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So I have to mention here on OLR, I know I briefly mentioned it on Bobby's show because we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, right after our pal Bobby Blackwolf and his program.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And we were talking about on the call, because he's good to donate 5, 10 minutes of his show every week to us when he calls us to do this little, what did we call it way back in the beginning, the Stuart Colbert thing, the throw, the toss.

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The handoff?

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Yeah, the handoff, I guess.

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It's the handjob.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Now, Bobby, show us a family show.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
But we're not.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's handwork.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
All right, anyway.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
His is the happy ending.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And we were talking about your hoodie that you have that is it's Cassandra from Dragon Age?

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Yeah, it's the Cassandra armor hoodie.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So it's got like leatherette-ish shoulder pads and gauntlets and the big Inquisition symbol.

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And I like it because I'm wearing leggings today because I didn't give a fuck and it covers my ass.

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So she literally paid for cosmetics.

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Hi, Tech Master Loki, how are you?

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm fine.

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Good.

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
No, but I mean, this thing looks like full cosplay garb when she's wearing it around the house.

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And I'm like, when she has to go grocery shopping at seven and then defend the realm at eight.

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Yeah, I'll find a link to it on the BioWare store and link it in the chat.

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
OK, there you go.

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Yeah, but it also, though, is really freaking comfortable.

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
That's the fun thing about it.

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And I'll go ahead and throw this out there.

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I've lost twenty five pounds in the last two months.

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Congrats.

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Thank you.

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's really comfortable now.

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's so soft on the inside and it's just it's like wearing a blanket.

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So almost like wearing my kigurumi.

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
But my kigurumi is way comfier.

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So it's a Snuggie.

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's not it's not tight.

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
That's it's different when it actually fits and isn't a little too small.

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I should mention we do tape live on Sunday nights.

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I mentioned that part the six o'clock Eastern at voice network.

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
But I don't believe I mentioned our chat room.

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
If you are listening live, you can join our chat room over at live dot vog network dot com.

55
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Where Dark Tetsuya says that segment is called the toss over what we're trying to think of there.

56
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Yeah, but toss is offensive in Europe.

57
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Vid Power says, I heard Cassandra and Armor and I immediately thought of Soul Calibur.

58
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Well, that's it's not a bad thing you're doing.

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You know, there's just there's many characters named Cassandra who are great and amazing.

60
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So there you go.

61
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
High tech master Loki.

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I know we said hi to you a minute ago, but your official introduction.

63
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
How are you doing this week?

64
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm doing OK.

65
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Yeah. What's new in your world?

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Nothing.

67
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
No Lego projects.

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
No, nothing.

69
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
No, not really.

70
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I mean, nothing I can discuss.

71
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
No, I really am doing like Christmas shopping.

72
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So it got some of that out of the way.

73
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Since you are a Lego guy, let me ask you about this,

74
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
because I don't remember if it came up on last week's show,

75
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
but I know it was all over Twitter either last week or this past week.

76
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Is that apparently the Tron.

77
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Yes, that was me that posted that.

78
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Yes. So Tron.

79
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Yeah, you posted that.

80
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So yes, we got the approval pass the review process.

81
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Yes, the Lego.

82
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So Lego does this contest like all year round.

83
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yeah, it's all the time.

84
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So it's basically this page called Lego ideas so you can submit your own designs for things.

85
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And if they get 10,000 votes, then it goes to a committee that they basically decide whether they want to make it into a set or not.

86
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And I've seen the one for RuPaul's Drag Race, and I don't understand why it doesn't have 10,000 votes.

87
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
A lot of them. Well, yeah, some of those like it's kind of weird why they don't have 10,000 votes.

88
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And they do give you more time as you get more votes.

89
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And a lot of the things that they don't seem to get votes for or don't approve are stuff that they have to license.

90
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Right.

91
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Because there's a lot of like license stuff that people want to pass through there.

92
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
But this winter.

93
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
But the Tron light cycle, yes, did make the cut.

94
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So apparently it is going to be coming out at some point.

95
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Now, the one that they showed online is the one that, you know, the person designed.

96
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
So Lego actually goes and then does the design for it based off of what they did.

97
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
But it's really cool those sets.

98
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I've got one.

99
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's the old fishing store is one that came out not too long ago in September.

100
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And that was a pretty nice set.

101
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And they've got it's kind of cool inside those Lego idea sets.

102
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
They have like kind of a brief like bio of the person that designed it and kind of showing like his prototype and stuff.

103
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And like talking about the Lego designer and what how they adapted the design to make it like Lego stuff.

104
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Well, I'm glad something is kind of keeping Tron going when I get worried that Disney's forgetting about it.

105
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Although, to be fair, the theme parks, you know, we know the Tron thing is going to happen in Florida.

106
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So Tron is is not forgotten.

107
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And of course, if you like video games and you like Disney stuff like Tron is.

108
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I mean, you've got Kingdom Hearts and you've got Tron.

109
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
And I think, you know, people of a certain generation kind of really fondly remember Tron.

110
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
At least I know I do.

111
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Nothing against Kingdom Hearts.

112
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
But seriously, explain the plot of Kingdom Hearts to me.

113
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Go.

114
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I haven't played enough.

115
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's only a three hour podcast.

116
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You don't have enough time to explain the plot of Kingdom Hearts.

117
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Disney and Capcom fucking have an ugly baby.

118
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Not Capcom Square.

119
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Yes.

120
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Well, you know why you said Capcom?

121
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Because the old NES games were all the Capcom stuff like an Oscar paid.

122
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And of course, DuckTales.

123
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You know, Disney and Squeenix fucking have an ugly baby with bad fashion choices.

124
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Yes.

125
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
They have like other weird sets that have become like Lego ideas.

126
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So it's like you may remember they have the Big Bang Theory set.

127
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Burn it.

128
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Yeah, that's terrible.

129
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:52,000
The one that they have coming or that it's proposed they're going to be considering it, I should say, is the set for Gilmore Girls.

130
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
That's funny.

131
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I know people that are really into that show.

132
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
They're like that.

133
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Oh, oh, has anyone submitted a set for The Good Place?

134
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Not yet.

135
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
My favorite sitcom as of late.

136
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
No, not yet.

137
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I talked about that.

138
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I mean, I think I've given that show free publicity like every week.

139
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I actually got that message on Facebook a couple of weeks ago from from my buddy Brad

140
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
from Pod Culture on the network who said you talk about it so much on OLR.

141
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I finally watched it.

142
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I watched all of season one.

143
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It was pretty funny.

144
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Yeah, I mean, I probably am a few episodes behind, but yeah, I did.

145
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I did actually.

146
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I've been watching all of it and it's fantastic.

147
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Yeah, I watched it.

148
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You know what I watch?

149
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
What?

150
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I watch the Discovery Channel.

151
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Actually, sometimes the History Channel.

152
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Yeah, Batman Ninja, because that trailer came out this week.

153
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
That looks awesome.

154
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's a real thing.

155
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
He's not really look.

156
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
He doesn't look like a ninja.

157
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
He looks like samurai.

158
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Yeah, but who cares?

159
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Dear white people.

160
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I don't care what they call it.

161
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It looks awesome.

162
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Dear white people, don't make it look Japanese and call it ninja.

163
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Like a feudal Japan Batman versus a joker.

164
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It would be more accurate to me to make him like Batman the Ronin.

165
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
That would be pretty badass.

166
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
All right, let's get into video games.

167
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Believe it or not, it's a video game show.

168
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
We're going to run a little bit of a shorter show tonight.

169
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
So here's the deal.

170
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I was gone all weekend.

171
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Jamie has an appointment in the morning, so we can't go too late into the night.

172
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
So we're going to do a little bit of a shorter show.

173
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And because I just got home from my trip about an hour and a half ago,

174
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
we don't have a script tonight.

175
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
The show's not scripted, but we have what we call a show roll with the itemized stories.

176
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I got to totally derail the show again.

177
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
What a shock.

178
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Just briefly, we totally need to have a Good Place episode

179
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
where we just censor ourselves exactly like the agent on the show,

180
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
because that would be hilarious.

181
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Maybe April Fools, we could do that.

182
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Because I'm always shocked that we actually have a wiki.

183
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
On the wiki, it's like orangeloungeradio.wiki.com.

184
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And I don't think I've ever edited an article on there, maybe once.

185
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
So I'm really impressed by like...

186
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I edited my own article.

187
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Did you really?

188
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Yeah, because people got some of the shit wrong.

189
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
That's right.

190
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
But I think most of it has been powered by listeners of the show, which I think is amazing.

191
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
But where was I going with this?

192
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Oh, yes.

193
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
So one of the jokes, you can read about this on the wiki,

194
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
because this joke kind of expired several hundred episodes ago.

195
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
But we kept talking about how we were going to do a fuck show.

196
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And I don't remember where this came from.

197
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I don't know if it was because we were talking about how movies, like Pulp Fiction,

198
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
say the word fuck like 260 times.

199
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I think it came from a joke like, oh, we could outdo that.

200
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Because House of the Dead was one of the House of the Dead games.

201
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
That's it.

202
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Like one of the movies that Uwe Boll did was trying to say...

203
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
No, it wasn't even Uwe Boll.

204
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It was House of the Dead Overkill.

205
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It was a game that came out.

206
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
And they were like, oh, yeah, we inserted the word fuck so many times into that.

207
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It has a record number of fucks in there.

208
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
And I'm like, we could beat that.

209
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Yeah, so we did.

210
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
But we finally delivered on that episode.

211
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I don't remember the number.

212
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It wasn't as funny as we had thought.

213
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
No, some of those things were like...

214
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Then when the show happened, I think halfway through, we were like,

215
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
okay, we thought it would be a lot funnier, and it really wasn't.

216
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
No, it was on paper it was funny.

217
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
But a Good Place episode.

218
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
A Good Place episode would be funny.

219
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
That would be funny.

220
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
So there you go.

221
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
All right, anyway.

222
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
So back to games, Loki.

223
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Sorry.

224
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,000
So anyway, I was out of town this weekend playing Ingress, which is a cell phone game.

225
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I play it a lot.

226
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I don't always talk about it here on the show because it's kind of like one of those things

227
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
that kind of comes and goes in waves, right?

228
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
So Ingress, if you don't know the game, it's by the people who did Pokemon Go,

229
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
but it's the game that they did before Pokemon Go.

230
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
So all your PokeStops and your gyms and stuff come from this game, Ingress.

231
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Ingress has a small but very rabid following here in the US.

232
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's very big in Japan, which is I think part of the reason why Pokemon Go,

233
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
how Nintendo kind of got connected with them.

234
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I think we know that story that the Pokemon company guy actually was playing Ingress,

235
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
and that whole thing happened.

236
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
And it's big around the world.

237
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
A lot of people are out there playing it on their cell phones

238
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
because it kind of gets them out and they're moving.

239
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:17,000
So anyway, every few months, like once a quarter or so in various cities around the world,

240
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,000
they will do these big live battles where special events happen in big cities,

241
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
and it's kind of a chance to get together with hundreds of other people who play the game

242
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
and basically play a different version of the game for four hours on a Saturday.

243
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
That's my nutshell description of what happened on Saturday

244
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
because San Francisco was one of the cities picked,

245
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
which is only about a two-hour drive from OLR headquarters here in Sacramento.

246
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
So we were able to drive over and play the game there.

247
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:49,000
So I bring that all up because it kind of leads to a lot of AR news that's going on.

248
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
So we've got hundreds of people swarming downtown San Francisco playing this game,

249
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:59,000
and I think what they do, I think Niantic's really good about contacting the tourism industry in these cities

250
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
and kind of letting them know what's happening so that way the city's kind of prepared for it,

251
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
although I don't, you know, in these events I've been,

252
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
this is only my third live event that I've attended in person.

253
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I did one in Tucson last year, and I did one in Chicago.

254
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And I don't remember, and then this one is San Francisco,

255
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
and I don't remember any of them being particularly like,

256
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
oh, the city did anything special type of thing, but it's just, I guess, like a heads up or whatever.

257
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
So anyway, I want to kick off tonight's show because not only did I have that AR thing going on,

258
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
which is why I'm very tired today, but we had some big news going on in AR gaming

259
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
that kind of changes essentially the future of AR gaming, right, Dark Sakura?

260
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Yeah, but I need to, I do need to make a quick disclaimer.

261
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Okay.

262
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I do know that the Kill la Kill guy is behind the Ninja Batman.

263
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I was quoting something from Facebook.

264
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Oh, oh, is this something in chat? Somebody correct me?

265
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Yeah, I was like, I know I am quoting something that someone said on Facebook because it was funny.

266
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Was it though? Was it?

267
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Whatever.

268
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
All right, moving on.

269
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Yeah, and I didn't get to go because I was sick to the AR thing.

270
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Sorry to hear it.

271
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Yeah, it is what it is.

272
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:15,000
So, um, but man, why, why can't we have nice things in, um, you know, for Pokemon Go?

273
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It's because people decide to be shit.

274
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Um, in Milwaukee County, there was a lawsuit that went against Niantic

275
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
because the players went and trashed a big park, Lake Park.

276
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:35,000
And so, uh, the county got Niantic to remove the PokeStops and that should have set it down,

277
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:42,000
but then they passed an ordinance that said that, um, that companies that want to do, uh,

278
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:49,000
augmented reality in these places have to have a permit with like some kind of insurance.

279
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
It's sorry, a significant of insurance in the amount of $1 million.

280
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
So basically like you're doing a food truck festival anytime you want to play Pokemon Go in the park.

281
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Kinda.

282
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Something like that.

283
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Yeah, and really it's just, it's just really terrible.

284
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I mean, but basically the, um, a US district judge, um, put an injunction against the county in July

285
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
because the ordinance was, uh, I'm actually going to quote on this,

286
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
because of the strangeness and lack of sophistication of the rules, um,

287
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
and that those rules infringed on first amendment rights.

288
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
And so the federal court said, yeah, that's totally the case.

289
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,000
And so, uh, they wanted to move forward, uh, with the trial to, because they, you know,

290
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,000
the county, the Milwaukee County supervisor wanted to move forward with the trial and there wasn't a trial.

291
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:48,000
So basically, um, they came to an agreement, um, that the injunction against the ordinance is permanent

292
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
and that the municipality has to play, uh, pay Niantic's legal fees.

293
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:59,000
So, um, but I mean, the good thing is that at least that's not coming out of the taxpayers.

294
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It's coming out of insurance.

295
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
So just one quick thing too.

296
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I do not believe Niantic was the one that filed the lawsuit, even though they're the game that keeps getting brought up.

297
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Some other, and to be fair, I follow like lots of AR games and this is one I have not played.

298
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I subjected myself to poke to Garfield Go, which was garbage.

299
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It was a group called Candy Labs.

300
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Okay. That's it. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

301
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Yeah. But at any rate though, they ended up having to pay the legal fees and everything.

302
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,000
So, well, I mean, you know, there's a part of me that wants to go good, even though I don't feel good about the,

303
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
you know, people in this city for what their city council did, but at least the money's coming out of insurance.

304
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:46,000
So whatever. But thank God this precedent was not allowed to be set because that would have really ruined AR gaming everywhere.

305
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:55,000
You know, everything from Pokemon Go to Ingress to, you know, even, and I don't even, where would geocaching fit in with that?

306
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Because like, I know there's Munzee.

307
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I don't think a lot of people have probably heard of that, but Munzee is another app that's kind of like, it's like geocaching mixed with gaming, basically.

308
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:10,000
It's kind of like the bridge thing where it's basically like find these barcodes that are on stickers in your favorite places type of thing.

309
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
So I worry that an ordinance like that, like where does geocaching fit in with that?

310
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Because geocaching is like a hobby for a lot of people, like there aren't even normally apps involved.

311
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
You know, there can be. It makes the whole process a lot easier. There doesn't have to be.

312
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:35,000
So I don't know. I just, this is a precedent I'm very glad was not allowed to be set because it just, you know, if you can play chess in the park, if you can play Frisbee in the park,

313
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:42,000
why can't you take out your phone and point your camera in a certain direction at the park? Doesn't make sense.

314
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Yeah. No, this is, and the other thing too, just on a side note that I was glad that the language of the, the ordinance was called into question because we've seen it with a lot of other laws that go in tax scam,

315
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,000
where they sneak language into it. That's very ambiguous. That could be, Oh, hi smush.

316
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
That could be, I put him out my hand and he smushed his head into it.

317
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:16,000
That was just a total, that was a moment straight out of the room. I know I did not hit her. I did not. Oh, hi smush.

318
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:27,000
But, um, but I mean, the whole thing is that hopefully we get more cases that attack the language of something that, that bring into question.

319
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Ambiguity. Is that the word ambiguity in the language of, of laws so that we have a lot more ambiguity. Thank you.

320
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:46,000
That we, um, that we have more scrutiny as to what sneaks its way into it. So, yeah, that I, you know, I think this is for gamers.

321
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:53,000
This is definitely a win all around for city councils. This is a whole, you know, you really need to think about some of these things you're trying to make.

322
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Or, you know, if you're pissed that the citizens littered in the park, blame it on the citizens in the park and you know, this has to do with all these other stories.

323
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:08,000
And I hope I'm not stepping on anything someone else wanted to talk about tonight, but because it is a shorter show, we don't have a show roll.

324
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Um, but there's this whole other story going around about how somebody is doing a, uh, a, um, study about is Pokemon go killing people and that's the clickbait headline.

325
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:27,000
But what the article is really about is, is basically boils down to distracted driving. Like are people getting in more accidents where there are pokey stops and gyms because of this stuff?

326
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:35,000
And it's, and here's the thing, and you know, we talked a little bit about this. Anybody that plays Pokemon go is going to die. So it has a hundred percent mortality rate.

327
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I, I would just like to point out that there are tools that are now built into most modern phones, like the do not disturb while driving, which I encourage everyone to activate.

328
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Because any type of distracted driving can potentially lead to an accident, even if it's just looking at your phone for half a second to get a direction.

329
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:03,000
And it doesn't even have to be your phone. Like we all, we've all heard the story about so-and-so is doing their makeup while driving.

330
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Or eating.

331
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Eating is a big one. Or, um, now that everything, that these control panels are super fancy and you know, you can sometimes get distracted by pushing all the buttons on your control panel to do the radio or, you know, Spotify or whatever built into your car.

332
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:25,000
You know, there's millions of ways to get distracted while driving your car. So it's just like, you know, again, if you're going to choose to play Pokemon go while you drive and you get into an accident, is that Pokemon go's fault?

333
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
No, it's your fault for being a moron.

334
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Exactly.

335
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Yeah.

336
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I'm sorry. Did I say that rudely? I mean, your, your fault for being a fucking moron.

337
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Much better.

338
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I've got a fire today. I have a fire in my soul.

339
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
It needs more cowbell.

340
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Well, I can't have caffeine, so I'm going to have to fuel it somehow.

341
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:56,000
All right. Anyway, uh, so there you go at the top of the show talking about the, uh, big, uh, Pokemon go ordinance and, uh, the future of AR gaming looks good, which leads me into this whole Ingress event. Right?

342
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:09,000
So we're doing Ingress and you know, uh, it was fun. We played for four hours and then we went to Niantic's after party, which I have to say it was free to get into and they give you a drink ticket as you're going in.

343
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Nice.

344
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Yeah. Right? Like right there. I was like, dang, Niantic knows how to party.

345
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:25,000
And it was in a nice big space. They used the armory. The armory was where the Konami thing I went to like years ago. Right? So it was that same space, but all open and like, no, like, you know, it wasn't segmented a certain way or anything.

346
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:38,000
So it was all open in there and, uh, they, you know, we, we'd had drinks and, you know, we were, you know, there was food for sale and, you know, just to be able to chat and hang out with the people from your team or, you know, even, you know, meet some people from the other team that you've been battling with for a long time.

347
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:48,000
And, you know, all that. So a little bit of mixing there. And then they did some of the announcements. They came up on stage, they did the big, you know, the, the enlightened or the, the enlightened won the series because they won San Francisco.

348
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Yay. Everybody clapped and, you know, but the resistance to Kauai. So the other team can feel good, you know, to survey gets a chance to clap.

349
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:07,000
And, um, so, um, they're doing all these announcements and then they, they kind of end it. So, so Ingress is supposed to be also, it's an AR game, not just because it uses real world scenarios, but because technically there's this story.

350
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:25,000
That plays out online and there's a blog that you can go to. And I think the story has to do with like aliens have been discovered and one team of people, the enlightened wants to use what the aliens have to offer for the benefit of all humanity.

351
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:33,000
And the blue team feels that the aliens are trying to enslave humanity. So they're trying to resist this type of change, which is why they're there, the resistance. Right.

352
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:40,000
And I've totally oversimplified the story that for me just boils down to which color is prettier war, green or blue, which is why I play green.

353
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:51,000
So, so anyway, uh, there, there is this whole story behind it. They have characters and everything. So they acted out this whole scene on stage. It was like watching community theater, but whatever.

354
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:59,000
It's, it's fun because it's about a game that you spend a lot of time playing. And, uh, you know, the community managers are talking about some of their events that are coming up and, and one of the characters is on stage going, I have it.

355
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I have the truth. I have the, you have to show everybody the truth about the future and all this stuff and holding up something in the air. I couldn't see way in the back.

356
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:16,000
So anyway, it leads to this big unveiling of the trailer for Ingress Prime, which is the new game that Niantic is working on, except it is the old game.

357
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:26,000
It is basically what many of people who've been playing Ingress call Ingress 2.0. So the Pokemon Go creator Niantic, their next game is going to be their first game.

358
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:38,000
And it is essentially a rewrite of the game for the ground up. That's why I call it a new game because they are rewriting Ingress from the ground up, but the game itself, not going to, it's still, you know, they're not like radically changing with the game.

359
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
So they're going to get rid of the old game?

360
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Well, no, this is going to be, it's going to replace your old client.

361
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Oh.

362
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:51,000
So one day you're going to go in there and update your game and it's going to be like Ingress, Ingress is now Ingress Prime 2.0. So that's, that's it.

363
00:22:51,000 --> 00:23:01,000
But you know, they, and they, they stressed your agent stuff will carry over your level, your badges, everything you've earned in Ingress today is carrying over to this game.

364
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:08,000
But after they did the trailer, they actually said, Oh, by the way, we have some cell phones over here. We'd like you to check out Ingress Prime and tell us what you think of it.

365
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,000
So like all of a sudden this became E3 and I was like, go stand in a line to go for 30 minutes to see a game, right? So I did that.

366
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:20,000
So I got to see the Ingress Prime in motion and what was kind of cool about it is that, you know, it's definitely a huge graphic upgrade.

367
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:27,000
You can, you can spin the screen with one finger instead of using, you know, the two fingers and you can go, this is what I thought was really cool.

368
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:35,000
You can zoom underneath a portal so that you can see where the links are going a lot easier and see if things are crossing or not.

369
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
You know how like sometimes in the game today, it's really hard to tell what the hell is linked to what?

370
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Well, they're trying to make that easier in this new client and you can zoom way out.

371
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I would say if you zoom way out, you can easily see 10 times as much area as you can now.

372
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
So I thought that was kind of neat too. So, you know, as an Ingress player, that was exciting.

373
00:23:52,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I have some reservations about some of the things I would show, that was shown that really go into a very detailed gameplay mechanical level that I think would bore most of you because I don't think many of you playing, Chris.

374
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:15,000
But I will say, you know, there was some concerns I had about something called Intel because I noticed that when they were in the, they put communications in a separate tab, one of the tabs said Intel.

375
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,000
And I actually asked the guy, I said, are they moving Intel from the web onto the app? Is that why that says Intel?

376
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
And he said, I can't say anything about that. I can't show you that right now.

377
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
And so that said to me, they might be.

378
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:35,000
So, but to their credit, after the whole demo was over, they actually had a little laptop nearby and they said, we'd like to ask you a few questions about what you saw and how you feel.

379
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,000
So they actually asked, you know, what's your agent level? What do you, how much do you play and all this stuff?

380
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
And they said, what did you like most? What did you not like most? You know, what concerns do you have type of thing.

381
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,000
So I was, I felt like I was appropriately able to say what I liked and say what I didn't like.

382
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:58,000
And that it will be heard because, you know, although while this event was fairly crowded, it wasn't more than a couple hundred people and maybe only about a hundred stayed around and watched this demo.

383
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,000
So, you know, they're not going to get that much feedback. So I think that's, that's kind of neat.

384
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:10,000
So, yeah, so that's, I got to see the new Ingress Prime. So there you go. So again, I know a lot of you guys don't, don't play the game a lot, but I will say this.

385
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
You do have this to look forward to here on OLR in the future.

386
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Some of the, um, some of the people that I play Ingress with, uh, it's, it's starting to get out there more that I do this show, this Orange Lawns Radio Show.

387
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:28,000
And I've had actually a lot of the, the women that run the faction stuff here, uh, for my team in SAC, they really want to come on this show.

388
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:36,000
So we are going to have, I don't know the date yet, but we are going to have a ladies of Ingress night here at OLR.

389
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Nice.

390
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:44,000
So stay tuned for more. If I, if I can get one from the other faction, I'm open to it. So I'm not, it doesn't have to be one side of things.

391
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I'll see. I'll see what I can do. I'll see what I can do. I, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know who I can talk to over there.

392
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I see. I know one gal, actually I know one gal and if she would be willing to do it, I would really, really love to have her on. So we'll see.

393
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,000
You don't know her, but yeah. So I know most of the people, so it's fine. Yeah. Yeah. It's all the same to you. It's all the people that smash your crap in the middle of the night.

394
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I know I probably met you once. I don't, I'm sorry. I've been getting a lot of that in comms because I'll occasionally play at the park.

395
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Oh yeah. Yeah. And they're like, Oh, Hey, long time. Like, yeah, they're excited to see somebody playing in your area because you know how your area is.

396
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I know. That's why I stopped playing. Well then I have literally no time to play. I understand. I understand. I just, I can't.

397
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I'm going to take back my work lobby. You do that. I told you there's a smurf that thinks it's his. Oh, I'm going to smack it down.

398
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
All right. Anyway.

399
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:48,000
So that's, that's my little blurb on Ingress and what happened this weekend. And I had a really good time at the event and then they did today.

400
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:54,000
They did something called mission day, which is all about doing the missions in game where you hack the portals and you, you know.

401
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,000
So basically we explore the city and how can we get a little special badge on our profile that says you participated in mission day.

402
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,000
But it was actually really neat. Like I had never been with all the times I've been to San Francisco cause I don't live that far from there.

403
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I had never been down the walk on pier 14 where you can walk all the way out and like get these really great pictures of the Bay bridge and stuff.

404
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:18,000
So it was neat. So I did that this morning. It only took me about two hours to do what I needed to do. So yeah, it was cool.

405
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,000
So I'm excited about that. So I had a great time doing Ingress. So I look forward for Ingress prime coming out.

406
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:31,000
More information is at ingressprime.com and I believe The Verge ran an article that actually has screenshots.

407
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I think there's a trailer out there on the YouTubes as well, as well as the demo I saw somebody filmed it, even though it's a big no-no.

408
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,000
So there is a leaked demo on YouTube out there where you can watch the whole thing if you're curious about it. So there you go.

409
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,000
And if you want to know more about Ingress, if you want to play Ingress, I'm happy to help you out if you go green.

410
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:57,000
All right. Anyway, uh, let's get into some, uh, talk about our gaming weeks, the types of video games we have been playing this week.

411
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I guess I've already talked a lot about Ingress that kind of dominated my weekend, but I know you guys have been playing other stuff, right, Jamie?

412
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I'm actually restarting Animal Crossing New Leaf because apparently there is support for my weird idea about a person having a mental breakdown and finds herself in the world of Animal Crossing.

413
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Okay, I believe that.

414
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Where she has a nightly existential crisis at the roost.

415
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Mm-hmm.

416
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:30,000
So, I was gonna do it, I actually, um, have the Dolphin emulator, and I was gonna do it on, um, the N64 version so I could take screenshots with that.

417
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Um, I mean, and again, I own all of the originals, blah blah blah blah blah, all the stuff. Um, sorry, GameCube version.

418
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Um, but, I'm thinking that I like the newer character styles, plus there's more locations in the game that I can do stuff with.

419
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:58,000
So, um, the one thing is that I'm actually trying to find, like, a, and I know that they exist, but sort of like a, uh, a simulated version that I can use, like, direct camera angles in and everything.

420
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I found all the textures from New Leaf.

421
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
So, the textures in the, in the character model.

422
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
So, anyway, that's been kind of my thing lately, and I'm playing a lot to Pocket Camp. I'm level 34.

423
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Would it be fair to say that the mobile, you're level 34?

424
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Yes.

425
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Okay, I guess I can't talk because I just literally played Ingress all weekend long, so I literally cannot say anything, but I did have a pause moment of shock.

426
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
All right, that's great.

427
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I checked the game three times a day.

428
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
That's, no, that's, I, again, I can't fucking talk. I played Ingress all weekend.

429
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I'm building a convertible right now for Cherry.

430
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
That's to get her past-

431
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:38,000
You have to build them fucking cars? Like, the, the couches and the, the refrigerators? That's not enough? You have to make them a fucking car?

432
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Apollo wants a bass guitar, so I'm doing a bass for him. I'm on my fourth loan.

433
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
You had to take out a loan to build a bitch a car?

434
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
No!

435
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
What is this game teaching people?

436
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
No, it's for my, my van, my camper, my van again.

437
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
All right.

438
00:29:52,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Um, but I have the 150,000 Bell loan right now, and I was, I was actually thinking about using the mobile version for my, my thing, but-

439
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Okay, so I was gonna say, would it be fair to say that because of the mobile Animal Crossing, you've been thinking more about Animal Crossing, and therefore, that has led to, maybe I want to go back and play New Leaf and do this comic thing.

440
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I've had the idea to do the webcomic for about two years now.

441
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Okay.

442
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Um, but I just never put anything to it. I was either gonna hand draw it, you know, which I could still do it hand drawn, but I think it would be a little bit more fun to have screenshots, or at least get some of the locations or something, I don't know.

443
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I'm still working out the, the logistics behind it, but, um, I've also been playing Miitomo, and I played some Ingress, because, uh, reasons, and, um, uh, Pokemon Go, and, uh, Idol Poring, and Dragon Age Inquisition, and, um, um, and fucking with people's heads.

444
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
All right, it's a fun game.

445
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
All right, Loki, how was your gaming week?

446
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Um, it wasn't as fun as I thought it was gonna be, but, um, I, I played, or I finished the story campaign for LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2, and much like, um, god, there was another game I played that was kind of like this too, but it just kind of, it was just over.

447
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Like, all of a sudden been playing through levels and all of a sudden it's just done.

448
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I was like, that was it? That was the last level?

449
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:42,000
It's just very, I don't know, there wasn't any real memorable moments like there were with even the first LEGO Marvel Super Heroes game, and even the LEGO Avengers game, they had, but it seemed like they put more time into the story and stuff.

450
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:59,000
This one just seems very rushed and content lacking, I mean, because if you look at the LEGO Avengers game, I didn't like that one too much because instead of doing voice acting for a lot of the characters, they just took audio clips from the movies that they're in, because it's based on the Marvel movie universe.

451
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:07,000
And so, it was just kind of like, eh, I like the old voice actors better, and I just really wish they'd used those instead.

452
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I wonder if that has to do with the strike.

453
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
It could have been, maybe.

454
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:18,000
This time though, they did voice actors, they didn't use the same old voice actors, so that was kind of jarring.

455
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:31,000
But, with the last game, the LEGO Avengers game, they had all these hub worlds, and they had Manhattan, because usually you get one giant hub world that you can run around, it's kind of free roaming and stuff, and you can do puzzles and stuff in there, plus they have all the levels.

456
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Well, this one had that, and then it had all these other hub worlds that were kind of cool as well, so there's like a lot of content in there.

457
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:49,000
This one doesn't have that. This one has the stupid Chronopolis thing, which is just like tiny pieces of each of these little worlds just jumbled together in this big mess of a world.

458
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
It's just kind of crap, and it's just very unmemorable and just dumb.

459
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
And the storyline to the whole thing was kind of lame, too.

460
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:03,000
The only thing that was good about it was they had some pretty good boss fights. I think they're interesting designs.

461
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:11,000
But, it's just like the Kang character is just very lame. Just the boss fight at the end was kind of stupid.

462
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Because he fights Captain America, and Captain America gets big for some reason, like this giant kaiju fight almost, and it should have been cool, but it was pretty lame.

463
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:29,000
So, I don't know. But, I still have to play through it to unlock all the characters and do all that.

464
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
But, it seems like it's more of a chore now than anything, just because my kids want to play it.

465
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I didn't get to play any of the VR stuff. I kept looking at it, but once again, my wife is very much monopolizing the TV.

466
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:48,000
And there's not a really good place to set up VR while she's watching TV and have it not interfere with the TV.

467
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
So, unfortunately, I didn't get around to that.

468
00:33:52,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Also, I did play a little bit more of LEGO DC Universe 2, which was LEGO Batman to DC Universe.

469
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I'm really trying to get away from LEGO games, though, because I've got a lot of other stuff to play.

470
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
South Park! I still have South Park. I bought that, downloaded it, haven't played it yet.

471
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,000
But, I do want to get into that. I just wanted to finish the one game first before I got started on something else.

472
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,000
So, I'll probably do that, but I'm very much looking forward to playing South Park. I hear it's really good.

473
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Alright. I understand the struggle of having a game that you haven't played yet.

474
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I got my copy of Xenoblade Chronicles 2 on Friday, and I haven't even opened the package yet.

475
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Because I left Friday night, and I've been being a nerd on other stuff all weekend long.

476
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
So, hoping to maybe get into that a little bit tonight, if I don't just pass out early.

477
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
But, if nothing else, I'll start playing that tomorrow.

478
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
I've got six to eight VR games I have yet to play.

479
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Like, I've got just a ton of stuff that I bought over sales and stuff, and I've been meaning to play all of it.

480
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I just haven't gotten around to playing it yet.

481
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Alright. My gaming week. I have not played a lot besides Ingress this weekend, obviously. It was a lot.

482
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Well, actually, I was staying with our pal JD, who you see in chat a lot, and he's been on the show before.

483
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,000
And he was showing me Jackbox 4, which somehow, I hadn't gotten around to picking up yet.

484
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I don't know, like, I haven't had people over, so that hasn't been a reason for me to download it yet.

485
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I'm sure I'll get it eventually.

486
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
But he was like, have you played Jackbox 4 yet?

487
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
And I was like, actually, now that you mention it, no I haven't.

488
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:29,000
And I always support the Jackbox games, so it's weird that I kind of, like, this one just slipped on my radar.

489
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:34,000
So he fired it up so we could play Fibbage 3, which I really, that was really the only game we got to play.

490
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:40,000
He was telling me about some of the other games, like the monster, the game that sounds like it's freaking Grindr, but with monsters, and that's really funny.

491
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,000
And I would really like to invite Jackbox back on the show, because I want to know if they did research by using dating apps.

492
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,000
But anyway, there's all these other fun games in there.

493
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:55,000
But I got to play Fibbage 3, and that was great, because it has, like, this very, like, 70s look to it.

494
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:06,000
And I love the little transition, uses, transitions when you're picking the category, uses all these stock photography from the 70s of, like, women in 70s style bathing suits,

495
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:12,000
and men with the big bushy mustache, Burt Reynolds mustaches and stuff that is, like, the horrible fashion of the 70s, what looks horrible now.

496
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,000
You know, and all that stuff. I just, I got a kick out of the look and how that whole game looked.

497
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
And they tried to do some new things with the formula, too.

498
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
I mean, it's still Fibbage at the end of the day, but I like that they had, like, social media questions.

499
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Like, one of the questions we had was some supermodel had posted on her Twitter,

500
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I'm trying to set blank as my desktop picture, and you had to, you know, fill in the blank with what it was.

501
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
And I fooled JD, I put Obama, and he guessed it. He guessed it was Obama.

502
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,000
And I think the real answer was her boobs. Yeah, the real answer was her boobs.

503
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
And I thought, oh, the game's not going to put her boobs in there.

504
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
And I think I put the runway or something really dumb that somebody else had put in.

505
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
And yeah, the answer, it turns out, she had tweeted that she wanted to put her boobs as her background picture.

506
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Would you ever do that, DarkSagra? No.

507
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Fuck no.

508
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
No, I wouldn't put my butt as my background picture, either.

509
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
It's just a little bit, I guess, you know, supermodels are different.

510
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I think I could put supermodel's boobs as my background picture.

511
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
That's not the same thing.

512
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Anyway, so that was something I got to learn playing Fibbage.

513
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Oh, and then the bonus round was different, because the bonus round was blank and blank.

514
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
So it was like a pair of things that went together.

515
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:28,000
And I think it was something about Richard Nixon's food you would never guess that he liked was blank and blank.

516
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
And I don't know, I put something disgusting, like peanut butter and pickles or something.

517
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
And I think I actually did, I tricked JD again.

518
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
And you might think I'm a really good liar, but he was a better liar, actually.

519
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
I fell for his answer like every fucking time.

520
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Turns out, did you know the real answer, I mean, spoiler alert, but did you know the real answer to that is ketchup and cottage cheese?

521
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Ew.

522
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Yeah, right? Disgusting.

523
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
My granddaddy used to eat ketchup on everything, including cabbage.

524
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
And cottage cheese?

525
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
And cottage cheese and eggs.

526
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
I don't know about that. Alright.

527
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Anyway.

528
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,000
So that's a pretty awesome looking, I'm watching the leaked footage of the, uh...

529
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Oh, the Ingress 2.0?

530
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Ingress 2.0.

531
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Yeah, and I told you about that?

532
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Yeah, or Ingress Prime.

533
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
It's pretty, it's so much, but it's pretty.

534
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
It's very, like, what drew me to Ingress...

535
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
It looks a lot cooler, I guess.

536
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
What drew me to Ingress in the first place was I was like, oh, it looks like Tron, but in the real world.

537
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
And now that I'm looking at Ingress Prime, I'm like, now it really looks like Tron.

538
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Yeah.

539
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
It's very cool. Anyway.

540
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Um, and then I played some World of Warcraft.

541
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Not a lot, but a little bit.

542
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
And, um, I don't know, it's just some other little stuff here and there, and that's really about it.

543
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
So, um, this next week I'm looking forward to actually sending out my Xenoblade Chronicles 2,

544
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
because I bought that, but I just haven't got started yet.

545
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
So I'm hoping to get into that.

546
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Um, so that was it for my gaming week.

547
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000

Unfortunately, we don't have any emails for you to read tonight,

553
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
but hopefully we'll get some for next week.

554

Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

555
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I'm curious what kind of games you guys might play outdoors.

556
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
You know, we talked about Ingress, Pokemon Go.

557
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Is there another AR game that you're into?

558
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Well, it's not an AR game.

559
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Don't send in sports as a joke answer.

560
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Like, I get that that's an obvious answer.

561
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
I mean, technology-based thing.

562
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
They have one that's, I don't know how well this would work,

563
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
but it's supposed to be like laser tag.

564
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I've seen like the guns at the store you can buy,

565
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
and they've got like an app that you, it works with,

566
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
and it's like you play laser tag with that.

567
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I just like, I can't imagine that would be very good.

568
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Eww.

569
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Apparently, DarkSakurai agrees.

570
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Eww.

571
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Okay, so this is why-

572
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Ketchup is gross.

573
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
No, I want to point this out. I want to point this out.

574
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Rama has just reinforced single-handedly in our chat

575
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
over at live.bognetwork.com why we don't click random links,

576
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
and I made the mistake because I go, oh, it's Rama.

577
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
He's not going to Rickroll me in the middle of the show.

578
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Rama knows better. He produces his own show.

579
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
So what did he fucking put in chat?

580
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
A tweet of a Pop-Tart covered in ketchup.

581
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Eww.

582
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
So, in the future, when I don't click your links in chat during the show,

583
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I want you to go and say, thanks, Rama.

584
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Thanks for that.

585
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
That's, yes, just remember the ketchup covered Pop-Tart

586
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
that made Rob not click the links anymore.

587
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Pizza, Pop-Tart, or something like that.

588
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
I thought they had, like, something like that.

589
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
If it's possible on the internet, I'm sure they did it somewhere.

590
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
All right.

591
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Let's get into some other news.

592
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
DarkSakurai, I know you had a few things you want to bring to the table tonight.

593
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
DarkSakurai, why don't you start us off with some news.

594
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Osaka has new ambassadors. It's Pikachu and Hello Kitty.

595
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Why can America not have cool stuff?

596
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Why, Japan?

597
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
I'm moving because I want-

598
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Well, one of our buddies is there right now.

599
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Yeah, buddy, give me a place to live.

600
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Actually, I'll be perfectly honest.

601
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,000
My goal ages and ages ago was to live in Kyoto.

602
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Still kind of a goal.

603
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,000
You know, if something happens to Dan, you may be doing OLR across the ocean.

604
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
But I just think it's pretty cool.

605
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:02,000
They basically are promoting Osaka as the 2025 ex-Boho city.

606
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
So that's pretty cool.

607
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
And I have completely different news, too.

608
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
It's about Cuphead.

609
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Okay.

610
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
You know how Cuphead is hard as balls?

611
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Yeah, why, yes I do.

612
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Actually, balls aren't really hard.

613
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
I was able to beat the tutorial, though, which is why I'm allowed to do this program.

614
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Yeah.

615
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Well, Cuphead got a patch to polish it up just a teensy more.

616
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,000
And it basically did away with some of the little bugs that people found.

617
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Like replicating Mugman many, many times.

618
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Does that mean they made the game harder?

619
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Yes.

620
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Because you can't exploit it anymore.

621
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
They can't cheat.

622
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
It actually, in some ways, made things a little bit easier, too.

623
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
So it fixed random freezes.

624
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Yeah, that's good.

625
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
And it improved saving and loading.

626
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,000
There's nothing more infuriating than a difficult video game

627
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,000
than a difficult video game where you lose all your progress thanks to a freeze.

628
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
So that does make the process easier.

629
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:07,000
It left the ability to charge your weapon as maintained through parry.

630
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:13,000
And you can unequip your secondary weapons from the equipment menu.

631
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,000
And just fixing a lot of weird little glitches on there.

632
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
It fixed some of the hit boxes.

633
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:25,000
And yeah, a few things worse, a few things better.

634
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Loki, I think you should put that on your list of things to play as Cuphead.

635
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
I have played Cuphead.

636
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Have you?

637
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
I didn't realize that.

638
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Yeah, it's fun.

639
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I'm wrestling here at the show a few weeks ago.

640
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
I need to play it more.

641
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
I played a little bit on Twitch that one night,

642
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,000
and I played a little more after that, but I need to try to finish it.

643
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
It's really fun.

644
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Yeah, it definitely is difficult.

645
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
I've watched all the boss videos and stuff like that.

646
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
It's one of those games that's going to get completely lost

647
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,000
in these end of the year game award stuff because of Zelda and Mario.

648
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
I don't know if it will.

649
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Well, it didn't get nominated for a game of the year, anyway.

650
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
I would have expected this game to be game of the year material for a lot of people.

651
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
I really do.

652
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I don't know.

653
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Well, certainly when it comes to art direction and style.

654
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
It doesn't have the replayability for that, I don't think.

655
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
But that's not a bad thing, though.

656
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
That's like Mega Man.

657
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I mean, it has Mega Man replayability, whereas it's linear.

658
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Okay, speaking of Mega Man, when I first played Mega Man 2 on the NES,

659
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
I had that moment of, oh, my God, I'm playing a cartoon.

660
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,000
When you see some of those sprites playing, I'm playing a fucking cartoon.

661
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:34,000
But then when I played Cuphead, no, really, I am fucking playing a cartoon right now.

662
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:41,000
It's another example of one of those, just when you think graphics can't get any better, here you go.

663
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:46,000
And it's not that the graphics are particularly anything more stunning than, say, Destiny 2,

664
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
which is a great graphical game in a different way.

665
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
But Cuphead, because of that art direction and the art style they picked,

666
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
it looks like something they picked straight up out of the 30s.

667
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
It's pretty astounding.

668
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
So if you haven't played Cuphead, you really should check it out.

669
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
I worry it's one of those games that most people will watch on Twitch

670
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,000
and be like, nah, I'm not going to play that, but it looks good.

671
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Well, looks good isn't going to give the developers incentive to make another one.

672
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Although I heard it did sell very well, so we're probably going to get another one.

673
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Or at least that studio will get the opportunity to make another game

674
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,000
that hopefully has a great style of whatever it is they choose.

675
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
All right, I think that is that all you had, Dark Soccer?

676
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Let's go to Loki for a few more stories.

677
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Including, why don't you tell us about the breakfast box that's getting tweeted everywhere right now.

678
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Well, I was going to talk about that in a second, but first I want to actually talk about...

679
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Fine, no, I'm just kidding.

680
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Well, since we were talking about Mega Man, I wanted to mention that there is a Mega Man anniversary

681
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
thing that's going to be happening tomorrow.

682
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:50,000
So on December 4th, Capcom is actually going to be doing a live stream of Mega Man

683
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
for the 30th anniversary of the Mega Man series.

684
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:58,000
And so it's going to start at, looks like 11 a.m. Pacific time.

685
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:03,000
And they said one hour prior to the stream, they're going to be airing a streamer showdown pre-show

686
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
with trivia and guest appearances of that.

687
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,000
So my guess is they're going to announce something during this.

688
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Did you hear about who retweeted that tweet?

689
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:20,000
No, Sony and Nintendo both retweeted that tweet.

690
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
So, draw the conclusion that you will.

691
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,000
There's a lot of people theorizing that the conclusion, a lot of people jumping into,

692
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Mega Man Legacy Collection on the Switch, which would be great.

693
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:38,000
I think that's something, you know, I still have not bought that Saturday morning Disney game collection

694
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
because I want it on the Switch.

695
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Maybe the Mega Man collection thing will come out on the Switch.

696
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
I think that would be great if it did.

697
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Or maybe they're going to do Mega Man 11.

698
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Maybe they're going to do some big thing tomorrow.

699
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Mega Man Legends Collection.

700
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
I'm kind of okay with that actually.

701
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
One and two, I mean.

702
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Or an X collection even. I don't know. So we'll see.

703
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
I mean, it could be literally anything tomorrow. So we'll see.

704
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Yeah, that'd be cool.

705
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Excited about that.

706
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
That's something.

707
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
But yes, to allude to what Rob was talking about earlier,

708
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,000
there is, of course, a brand new cereal hitting the market.

709
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,000
It's the Super Mario Brothers Cereal.

710
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
It's for breakfast now.

711
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Nintendo, it's a cereal.

712
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Wow.

713
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
So they've got this new cereal that's coming out.

714
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
It's I guess through Kellogg's.

715
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:29,000
And it's what's kind of unique about it aside from the fact that it's got Mario Brothers marshmallows and stuff like that in there.

716
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
And we all know marshmallows are the best part of any breakfast.

717
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Marshmallows are disgusting. You shut your mouth.

718
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Even the gross dehydrated marshmallows you get in breakfast cereal.

719
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
I love the dehydrated ones in.

720
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Here's my problem.

721
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Now I'm going to derail you, you son of a bitch.

722
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
That's fine.

723
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Go right ahead.

724
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,000
I don't. Okay, this is where everybody's going to go, Rob, you are a fucking freak. You ready?

725
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,000
I don't like milk and cereal at all.

726
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
And so people go, well, how do you eat your cereal?

727
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
And I go, easy.

728
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
You put it in a bowl, you get a spoon, and you eat the cereal out of the bowl.

729
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
You don't need anything in it.

730
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:11,000
But in those types of cereals where you have dehydrated parts in it, it kind of makes those marshmallows a little bit nastier, I think.

731
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
It makes them slimy if you like put milk in there.

732
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Yeah.

733
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:20,000
But I like them when they're dehydrated and you kind of chew on them and it's like chewing through like high density foam or something like that.

734
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
See, I wouldn't know. I don't like milk and cereal.

735
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Maybe I'm lactose intolerant.

736
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Sometimes.

737
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:35,000
I'm actually not, but I just don't, I don't, I don't like that much milk. That's the problem.

738
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Well, sometimes this is why I do too. Like if you don't like tons of milk and cereal, you get a giant like oversized cup of cereal and a glass of milk and you just down the cereal first.

739
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:50,000
And you eat it and then you drink some milk when your mouth gets too dry.

740
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
For some reason, that I'm okay with.

741
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:59,000
I've done that like cause there's some cereals that are better dry than they are with milk.

742
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:05,000
For example, one that I feel really loses all of its flavor in milk is Cinnamon Toast Crunch.

743
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Cause all the cinnamon gets washed off and you have this like lame ass soggy shit with some cinnamon on it.

744
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
This is the best part of OLR is knowing you're not alone.

745
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
SSG100Matt says, Rob, you're not alone.

746
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
And Dark Tetsuya says, I don't blame you Rob.

747
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,000
And JD says, what do you do instead? Use orange juice?

748
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
You're all gross.

749
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Well, clearly the answer is we use ketchup.

750
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Ketchup is also gross.

751
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Why do people eat disgusting things?

752
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Soy sauce?

753
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:38,000
That's what I ask when Loki brings a fucking sandwich from Subway loaded with extra mayo.

754
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
But I love mayo.

755
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Here's why I ask for extra mayo. It's because of their own incompetence.

756
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,000
It's not because I like a ton of mayo on my sandwich.

757
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:52,000
It's because I want the ratio of mayo to be greater than the amount of mustard they put on there.

758
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Cause otherwise the mustard just overpowers everything.

759
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
What's the problem? I love mustard.

760
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
You put light on the mustard.

761
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Mustard is also gross.

762
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
They just go way crazy with the mustard and mayo on there.

763
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
So I have to ask them to put extra mayo.

764
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
And I mean a little bit extra mayo, but then they go fucking crazy with it.

765
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Like there's just like a two inch thick layer of mayo in there.

766
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
I was like, dude, that's a little much.

767
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
I literally just gagged. I literally just gagged.

768
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Sorry, I didn't mean to give you that mental picture, but...

769
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
It's just, it's their own incompetence.

770
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Just make the sandwich like I want it.

771
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
It's not so hard.

772
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Alright, where the hell were we? God damn it, you derailed everything.

773
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Cereal. Oh yeah, cereal.

774
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
So what else about Super Mario cereal?

775
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:38,000
So the thing that's unique about it though is it has an amiibo thing on it.

776
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Yes, the cereal box is its own amiibo.

777
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Can't really store it with the rest of your amiibos, but hey, you can at least scan the box.

778
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Yeah, all you need is a little chip, right?

779
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Yeah, you can scan the box with your Nintendo Switch controller or Joy-Con or whatever and do that.

780
00:49:52,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Or you can totally be the lead hacker because your Switch is fucking portable and just go to the fucking supermarket and scan all the boxes with your Switch.

781
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Smart man.

782
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Without even having to buy the cereal.

783
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,000
That's right, because they can't afford to put that chip, that wrap on everything, huh?

784
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Yeah, you can't do anything. You can't do shit with that.

785
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
It's just fucking just go to the store and...

786
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Did you really think of that yourself or did you see somebody on Twitter or YouTube do that where they went to the supermarket?

787
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:20,000
No, I thought about it because when I saw that I'm like, well, what's going to stop people from just going to the store and doing that?

788
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Do you want to go to Save Mart, get my Switch, go to Save Mart right now?

789
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:27,000
I don't even know if it's out there. I didn't see it at the store.

790
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Oh my god, I love it.

791
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
I thought about stopping the store and getting some, but...

792
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Well, I mean, it makes sense to it. Like, I was...

793
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Okay, so everybody's thinking about like figures. Like, do you get a toy in your food again?

794
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:44,000
No. Think of the amiibo cards, you guys. They had the Animal Crossing amiibo cards, okay?

795
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
So they just made the bottom of the box or whatever, one of those cards.

796
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Well, is it built into the box or is there a card in the box?

797
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Like in little individual wrap? Because if that's the case, Loki, your trick's not going to work.

798
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Because maybe they just put an amiibo card in the box.

799
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,000
I thought it was attached to the back of the box, but I could be wrong. I don't know.

800
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
It would make sense. We'll see.

801
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Alright, Bobby Black Wolf in chat says it's out on the 11th or something.

802
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,000
And Black Wolf says they claim that the amiibo part is on the back of the box.

803
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Alright, so it's a giant amiibo card, basically.

804
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Interesting.

805
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Yeah. And apparently, what it does is it gives you gold coins or hearts.

806
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Oh, and Akuma JP says in Japan, they have an aluminum sticker over the chip.

807
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
You have to peel it to scan it.

808
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Well, I'm going to tell you right now.

809
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Akuma JP, I know there's some cultural differences here, but here's my question.

810
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Do you have a store called Walmart in Japan?

811
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Because I'm going to tell you what's going to happen.

812
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
They have Costco.

813
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
I'm going to tell you what's going to happen here in the US.

814
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,000
You're going to go look at that cereal aisle and all that fucking aluminum will have been peeled back already.

815
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
I don't know why. It's just random.

816
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
And it's something specific about Walmarts.

817
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
It's quality of customer.

818
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
It's the culture.

819
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Do they still have that blog, People of Walmart?

820
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
I'm sure they do.

821
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Ok, Akuma, if you want to see what America's like, go look for the blog called People of Walmart.

822
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
And that's what it's like living here.

823
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Alright, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, sir, put the switch away.

824
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:23,000
They're not going to yell at me at the grocery store over having a Nintendo Switch out.

825
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Especially if, no, here's what I'll do.

826
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
I know what I'll do.

827
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
This is how I don't get yelled at.

828
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,000
I will let a child that I've kidnapped hold the switch.

829
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
That way I won't get yelled at.

830
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
That's a good idea, right?

831
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Because you're not going to yell at my pretend kid for bringing the switch.

832
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Child kidnapping, well, geez, you're just lining up right for Congress, you know?

833
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
You have what it takes to be in politics.

834
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Vote Rob Roberts 2020.

835
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
What do I have to say?

836
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Alright, Vidpower in chat says, the amiibo prize for scanning the cereal box doesn't seem too amazing.

837
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
You get, like, a heart.

838
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Dungeonbuster in chat says, we have a switch in aisle 4, repeat, security, we have a switch in aisle 4.

839
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:12,000
And Akuma JP regarding Walmart says, I see it on YouTube, my eyes roll so hard.

840
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:18,000
And SSJ100 Matt says, dress Mr. Smoosh as a kid and put him in a stroller.

841
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:23,000
The sad thing is he probably, Mr. Smoosh would probably do it.

842
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
I love it.

843
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Bobby Blackwolf says, yeah, it just tells you that you have a delicious amiibo and it finds a power moon like all the other amiibo do.

844
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
So, there you go.

845
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Alright, but that's, I mean, I almost think, I don't even think the amiibo thing's that big a deal.

846
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Like, I really don't.

847
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:50,000
I think it's more like, hey, hey, Nintendo cereal is, like, coming back. Like, it's, I mean, it's not the same cereal.

848
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:57,000
That's so cool, though. It would be even cooler, like, if it unlocked a cereal box character skin for Super Mario Maker or something.

849
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
What the fuck? A cereal Mario skin?

850
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Yeah, cereal box.

851
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Whatever, they have, like, springboards and shit in there.

852
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,000
A cardboard, you want, like, solid snake hiding in a cardboard box Mario?

853
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Like, I want a cereal box. I mean, what, they've got, like, you can do the, like, warp pipes and question blocks and in the springs and stuff like that, so why not?

854
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Yeah, when I think of Mario Brothers, I think of cereal, yeah.

855
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,000
It's Super Mario Maker and they have a bunch of weird shit in there.

856
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Alright, no, it's, it's, I'm just teasing you, it's fine. Alright, what else? New story.

857
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Alright, so, we can talk a little bit briefly about more EA shit. So, this is still kind of off of the whole Star Wars Battlefront II bullshit.

858
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:49,000
So, of course, you know, in response to the, you know, backlash against it is more excuses on why they didn't do things the way they did.

859
00:54:50,000 --> 00:55:00,000
So, one thing they said is, well, we couldn't possibly do Battlefront II cosmetics in the loot boxes because it would break the canon.

860
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,000
It would break the canon of Star Wars. Except...

861
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Like, they haven't rewritten it 50,000 times.

862
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Well, except that they had customization in the last game. They have customization hidden in the code of this game.

863
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:22,000
And there's also the stupid Star Wars Kinect game, which just broke all of the canons, so, whatever.

864
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Would you please reference the quote about Pink Darth Vader? Because that's the one that pissed me the fuck off.

865
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Uh, yes. Let me see if I can actually find that.

866
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:37,000
He said something like, you wouldn't want to play as Pink Darth Vader. And my reaction was-

867
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Bitch, I would.

868
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:45,000
The fuck I wouldn't. Like, maybe I would buy this fucking game if I could play as Pink Darth Vader. That sounds fucking rad.

869
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Yeah, unfortunately, this article does not have the quote in there, but basically it was something to the effect of, like, yes, White Darth Vader would, you know, break the canon.

870
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
And no one wants to play as Pink Darth Vader or something like that.

871
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:03,000
You shut your dirty little mouth. I know lots of people that would play as Pink Darth Vader.

872
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:09,000
So, it was just like, um, yeah, let's see. Okay, I think I have the exact one here, so, let's see.

873
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:17,000
So, one thing we're very focused on and extremely focused on is not violating the canon of Star Wars.

874
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:26,000
It's an amazing brand that's been built over many, many years, and so if you did a bunch of cosmetic things, you might start to violate canon, right?

875
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Darth Vader in white probably doesn't make sense versus black, not to mention you probably don't want Darth Vader in pink.

876
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,000
No offense to pink, but I don't think that's right in the canon.

877
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Number one, I'm offended. Number two, if we survive the Star Wars Christmas special, we will survive Pink Darth Vader.

878
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:50,000
In fact, I guarantee you Pink Darth Vader will be better than the Star Wars Christmas special and Star Wars Connect.

879
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Or did anyone tell him this is a fucking video game and you're not writing stories for Star Wars?

880
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:02,000
I mean, unless they're saying that these characters that they're creating for this game are part of the canon now, which I doubt it.

881
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Um, it was just dumb. So, that was the excuse that they made, and like I said, people did some digging in the code of the game and,

882
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Oh, what the hell is this? There's some fucking cosmetic shit hidden in here.

883
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Oh, but we can't do that because that will violate canon.

884
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Alright. So, anyways, so there's that. On top of that-

885
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
There's your weekly point in laugh at EA.

886
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Yes, exactly. So then, of course, um-

887
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Can we just give that a stupid award?

888
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Sure. I haven't done one in a while.

889
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Aside from that game and Need for Speed, another game that just recently was part of this whole EA early access thing was the EA Sports UFC 3.

890
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Which also apparently has the same pay-to-win loot box system, and it's even worse in Star Wars.

891
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Because the reason why, they have, um, cards in the game to actually affect your strikes in there.

892
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:01,000
So, if you have enough, you know, if you pay enough money, your punches are actually gonna be more effective than your opponent's punches.

893
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
So, it's just ridiculous that they're- and they're gonna keep doing it.

894
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:10,000
And one of the other things that they said too is that they're gonna, you know, still try to keep these microtransactions in the game.

895
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:18,000
So, it's- obviously, this is the path that they're wanting to go on with this stuff. And apparently, it's just ruining these games.

896
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Next.

897
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Next.

898
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:27,000
I'm gonna do this MTV early 2000s style.

899
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Next.

900
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Alright. So, um, as you know, the game awards are right around the corner, so that's gonna be something we'll be seeing pretty soon.

901
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Um, one thing, though, which I expect to be there, is a new trailer for Death Stranding.

902
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:47,000
And I think it's also gonna be a little bit confirmed, since, uh, Guillermo del Toro is gonna be there.

903
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:54,000
How about, if, I mean, trailer, okay, whatever, how about a glimpse of, like, what the game really looks like?

904
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Like, is it survival horror? Is it strategy? Is it- is it MMO? No, I know it's not MMO.

905
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
I just wanna see more.

906
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Yeah, right? Yeah.

907
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
I just wanna see more.

908
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Yeah.

909
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Um, so, that should be coming pretty soon. Um, I think that's later this week, so-

910
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
It is. I think it's Friday.

911
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Thursday or Friday, yeah.

912
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Yeah.

913
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Um, so definitely can't wait to check that out. Um, be hyped for that.

914
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Good luck with the game awards. I know we're sometimes critical of these, you know, gaming award shows, but, like, I- I will give credit where credit's due.

915
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:37,000
I think Jeff Keighley's really trying. Like, I think he's really trying more than, like, Spike TV and that stuff would let him, because you have all these, you know, people in a boardroom that think they know what gamers want.

916
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:41,000
And I think Jeff Keighley has his pulse a little bit- his finger a little bit better on the pulse of that.

917
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:48,000
I think there's still some weird stuff that happens at those shows, but it's, for the most part, it's better than it was, and it can only go up from here, I think.

918
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
So, I'm looking forward to seeing this.

919
00:59:51,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Um, since we were talking about Mario a little bit ago and Animal Crossing, uh, Pocket Camp, uh, we can't forget the last big Nintendo, well, we're gonna totally ignore the whole Fire Emblem game, but the last big Nintendo game, um, on mobile platforms, which will be Super Mario Run.

920
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:19,000
And in 2017, Super Mario Run was the most downloaded game on Android. So, apparently they're doing something right. I honestly never played it on Android.

921
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
My son did, though.

922
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:28,000
But not- I wonder, was it the most downloaded game on iOS? I wonder. Probably not.

923
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Uh, I don't think so.

924
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Because they're not touted there, or maybe those rankings don't come out until close to the end of the year, because I think iTunes will start its whole best of 2017 about, probably two weeks before the end of the year, because they take the holiday week off.

925
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:48,000
So, probably the week before that, you're gonna start seeing the whole best of 2017, as if there was anything good about this year.

926
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:53,000
There was some good music, some good movies, some really good movies. So, yeah.

927
01:00:53,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Alright, um, another game that's gonna be coming soon to consoles, uh, DayZ, which is actually leaving early access, um, it's gonna be coming to Xbox One next year.

928
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:13,000
They've been talking a little bit about the development of the game and how it's gonna play out on the Xbox One. Originally, they were saying that the game was gonna hit 60 FPS on the Xbox One X.

929
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:20,000
However, that's been retracted now, and it's gonna run at 30 FPS, which is kind of disappointing, especially if you're comparing it to PC.

930
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Um, but at least they're gonna say that, um, yeah, I guess they have, uh, DayZ is gonna be, you know, the game and the platform, and it says that we intend on keeping DayZ alive for as long as it's viable.

931
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:43,000
And I guess the release version one, it's gonna be, they said it's not the end of the content update, so, interesting.

932
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:53,000
I guess, um, I haven't really heard too much about DayZ in a while. I know with PUBG out and everything, it kind of seems to be a lot of people forgetting about DayZ in there.

933
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,000
So, interesting to see that that's still going.

934
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Um, as I was talking a little bit about VR stuff earlier, um, there's actually been a pretty big year for VR, so, it looks like one million VR headsets have, um, shipped, I guess, in a single quarter for the first time.

935
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:18,000
So, um, this is from, I guess, a market research firm called Canalysis, which broke down, um, the market by platform.

936
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:25,000
PlayStation VR shipped the most with over 490,000 units in the third financial quarter of this year.

937
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Of course, that includes July, August, and September.

938
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Oculus shipped, um, 210,000 units of the Rift, and the HTC Vive sold 160,000 units.

939
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,000
I'm assuming the Vive sold less because it was more expensive.

940
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:45,000
But, um, good to see that the platform's still going, and there's definitely a lot of content out.

941
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:56,000
I still think it can do even better, and especially now with some of these, um, other companies coming out with a little bit more affordable headsets, it'd be interesting to see how well those do.

942
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Although, the new Windows one I saw, the one that they had from Microsoft didn't look that great because their price point on it was originally going to be lower than everybody else, but then the Rift dropped its price, and so now it's kind of equal with that.

943
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Unfortunately, spec-wise, it's not equal with that, and so it's like, eh, you need to drop it further.

944
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Yeah.

945
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:23,000
But I'll be curious to see, um, how that turns out. I mean, I'm, I'm ready for the future where I do everything in VR.

946
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,000
I'm ready.

947
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
You ready for it? I'm ready.

948
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
I'm ready to play Desert Bus in VR.

949
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:31,000
I'm also, I'm also ready, yes. Well, I don't want to play Desert Bus in VR, but there's a thing that you can do now.

950
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:47,000
So, yes, Desert Bus VR, you can, uh, check it out. Of course, this was, um, featured in, um, I think it was, I don't know if, yeah, they were doing that as part of the whole, uh, Desert Bus for Hope, the 11th annual one.

951
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:59,000
So I guess they were playing, uh, Desert Bus VR, and, um, and it's out for, it's a free download on Steam for the Vive and the Rift, and of course, Desert Bus for those who may not remember.

952
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:10,000
It is a game that came out of, um, what was it, the Penn and Teller, I don't remember the full name of the game was, but it's a Penn and Teller game, where it's basically, you have to drive from...

953
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Smokey mirrors from, oh, oh, yeah.

954
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:24,000
So you have to drive, um, this bus, basically, that keeps veering slightly to the right, and, um, for, and it's the actual time that it takes to drive between these two cities.

955
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:34,000
So people do it just as kind of a punishment for themselves and also to raise charities, so, um, yeah, it looks like Desert Bus and VR, it's way prettier.

956
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:49,000
The game was created as a bit of a statement, and I'll let y'all go listen to Bobby's show, he gets more into it, I'm not gonna repeat it, um, but I think it's, it's a very tongue-in-cheek sort of statement, which Penn and Teller do, like, a lot.

957
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:53,000
You may remember they had that TV show, you know, that whole thing, that's kind of their thing.

958
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Yeah, it's from driving, I guess it's, yeah, they'll simulate driving from Tucson to Las Vegas.

959
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Yes.

960
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,000
In real time, without brakes.

961
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Yes, which, I mean, the drive from here to Las Vegas is bad enough, I can't even fucking imagine Tucson to Vegas.

962
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Oof.

963
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:09,000
But it's cool, though, I don't know what, if they have, like, other features in there.

964
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Oh, the VR one?

965
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Yeah.

966
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Yeah, you can be a passenger now, and you can, uh, you can sit in, as a passenger, and you can, like, throw spitwads at the driver.

967
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,000
And that's it.

968
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Why?

969
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Loki, you're asking a question about why does this game even exist in the first place. Why not?

970
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Also, something about, uh, the NPR interview-style interview that you can listen to on the radio.

971
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:37,000
The drones on and on, and they talk very quietly like they do on the radio.

972
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,000
That's awesome.

973
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Yeah, exactly.

974
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:46,000
All right, well, uh, I know you have a little bit more news, but I think this is a good time for us to take a trip down memory lane.

975
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Are you ready, Dark Sakura, to unveil?

976
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,000
I reckon.

977
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:53,000
It might be a short show, but we still got plenty of time to talk about classic games.

978
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Yes.

979
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
We always have a minute to talk about classic games.

980
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Every week, Dark Sakura jumps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, hey, this game is worthy of your attention.

981
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
It's the Classic Game of the Week.

982
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Yup.

983
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Dark Sakura, what is it?

984
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
R-Type Delta, I chose.

985
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Because I've already done R-Type, but R-Type Delta, believe it or not, is kind of a hard-to-get-your-hands-on bit of a game, and it is the-

986
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:26,000
That is not R-Type Delta, by the way. That is the, I keep forgetting to put the video ad blocker in Chrome, which I switched to here in the studio. Sorry about that.

987
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Oh, Rob.

988
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Here's R-Type Delta.

989
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Anyway, R-Type Delta is the fourth of the R-Type games, and the first one to use 3D.

990
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:45,000
It came out for PlayStation in 1999, and it's generally considered a really, really good game in the R-Type series.

991
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:49,000
A friend of ours just gave us a copy.

992
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
So, hey.

993
01:06:51,000 --> 01:07:02,000
R-Type Delta also offers different ships that you can pilot, and every one of the ships has-

994
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:18,000
You can get your force, which is like your big shield slash extra gun, and you get a dose gauge, which every time it hits 100, you can use the delta attack, which is a super attack.

995
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:25,000
So you start off with the R-9A Delta, which is based off of the original R-9 from R-Type.

996
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:32,000
You have the RX Albatross that has wings, and it uses the tentacle force.

997
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:45,000
R-13 Cerberus, which is a red and black one, and it has an energy ribbon that can attack, and then the POW armor, which you unlock after beating the game in medium or hard mode.

998
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:52,000
It was generally, you know, like I said, it was well received.

999
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:59,000
A lot of people even thought it was better than the original R-Type, although to me that's really, really hard to match.

1000
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:06,000
And it's basically considered one of these shooters you have to have if you have a PlayStation.

1001
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:15,000
For being in a PlayStation game, the polys are pretty nice, it's very complex, it looks really good.

1002
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Apart from just being super fun to play, although some people found that it was a little bit more difficult than it needed to be, but your mileage may vary.

1003
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:33,000
And as far as I am aware, there has been no other release of R-Type Delta, so good luck finding it.

1004
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:37,000
And that's it, R-Type Delta for PlayStation.

1005
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:51,000
I forgot they made this on PlayStation, but I like how it has kind of the better backgrounds in this, and just kind of like the solid black you remember from the, you know, TurboGrafx and other versions of this that existed, or other R-Types that were out there.

1006
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:57,000
I will say, you know, R-Type is still, I like the original R-Type better than this.

1007
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,000
But this is really freaking good.

1008
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:05,000
I like it better than Super R-Type, I like it better than R-Type too, so there you go.

1009
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Alright, R-Type Delta, your classic game of the week, here at Orange Lounge Radio.

1010
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:14,000
I think you just have a couple quickies left, right, Loki?

1011
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Yeah, a few more things, so we can...

1012
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Let me get quick, sorry, not to interrupt you, but you did it to me earlier.

1013
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:23,000
We will also start to open up the Skype line, I think is a good time to do that if you do want to give us a call and say hello tonight.

1014
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

1015
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

1016
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,000
The Skype line is open while Loki touches on these last few things here.

1017
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Yeah, I want to clarify because I was also kind of confused about, you know, DayZ and PUBG.

1018
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:40,000
So PUBG was actually the one that they said it was going to be originally running in 60 FPS, and now it's 30 across all platforms.

1019
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,000
That's kind of disappointing because PUBG is more popular.

1020
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:48,000
I have no idea what frame rate it runs on for DayZ, but at least it's coming to consoles, so that's kind of cool.

1021
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Alright, so other things we can talk about.

1022
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:58,000
So there's this cool new skin that's going to be coming out for the PlayStation 4 called the PlayStation 4 Legacy Theme.

1023
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:05,000
It's based off of the PlayStation 2 dashboard, and you can check it out for $2.99, and it looks pretty awesome.

1024
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:12,000
So they have that developed by, I guess, Truett Pixel who does some of these animated backgrounds.

1025
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:18,000
And they really did capture quite a bit of the PlayStation 2 dashboard feel, so check that out.

1026
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Also, on PlayStation Plus, you're going to be getting some games for December.

1027
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:28,000
And with those, Darksiders 2, the definitive edition.

1028
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Kung Fu Panda Showdown of Legendary Legends on PlayStation 4.

1029
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:37,000
And then PlayStation 3, Siberia Collection and X-Play's Lost Memories.

1030
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:44,000
And then for the Vita, Forma.8, which is a cross-buy with PlayStation 4 and Wanted Corp.

1031
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:55,000
And finally, we have Fireaxis announcing an expansion for Civ 6, which is Rise and Fall.

1032
01:10:55,000 --> 01:11:03,000
And, yeah, it looks interesting. Launching February 8th, it's going to, I guess, focus on the great ages.

1033
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:10,000
And introduce, I guess, a concept where your empire can go through a dark period.

1034
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:13,000
And they have a new city-based loyalty system.

1035
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Oh, kind of like 2017 when your civilization goes through a dark period.

1036
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Sadly, yes.

1037
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Yeah, okay, I get that.

1038
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,000
I don't know.

1039
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:23,000
I wonder if that was planned that way.

1040
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:27,000
That's a pretty clever move. I bet these things are planned years in advance.

1041
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:31,000
I think they have a different idea of what a dark age is.

1042
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:34,000
I know, but I can't. Jamie, am I right? You can't help but notice that.

1043
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Isn't it ironic that a game about a dark period for a civilization comes out right after 2017?

1044
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
A little too ironic.

1045
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Don't you think?

1046
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:46,000
And then last but not least, I wanted to mention that there's this awesome mod out there.

1047
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:53,000
So, if you're a fan of those battle royale games, well, there's a game that you may have played a while back called

1048
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is now getting modded to have a battle royale type gameplay in it.

1049
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:05,000
So, GTA San Andreas PUBG is, I guess it's a new mod.

1050
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:11,000
This one allows you to actually kind of play the whole battle royale thing in Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.

1051
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:19,000
So, they're seeing right now, at the moment, they are working on, there are about 200 to 400 players on various mod servers.

1052
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:27,000
And then they're seeing that they have, I guess, quite a bit of people interested in these types of mods.

1053
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:30,000
So, it looked kind of cool, but San Andreas is certainly looking dated.

1054
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:34,000
I would like something like this in maybe Grand Theft Auto 5.

1055
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,000
Well, they have something like that in Grand Theft Auto 5 online, but yeah.

1056
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:41,000
It's neat. I like mods in Grand Theft Auto, so why not?

1057
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Why not? I just saw a call come in that went away.

1058
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:49,000
OrangeLaunchRadio, all one word on Skype if you want to get in here.

1059
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Oh, there it is. Let's take this call.

1060
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLaunchRadio. Who's this?

1061
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Hi, this is Raginator.

1062
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Hey, Raginator. Don't forget to turn the...

1063
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Hi, this is Raginator.

1064
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Sorry, my computer was freezing out for a second.

1065
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:06,000
That's all right. You should know this by now. No, that's fine. What's up?

1066
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Yeah, I just have a quick question that I'd like to post to everyone.

1067
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Then I'll free up the line just in case anyone else wants to call.

1068
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Yeah, sure.

1069
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:25,000
All right. Well, not so much on this show too much, but as everyone remembers,

1070
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:33,000
you used to host Hoard House for a while before that show went on permanent hiatus,

1071
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:39,000
and towards the end of the run, you focus on all games that happen to be online.

1072
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Yep.

1073
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Now, I would like to pose a question on this show since Hoard House is no longer around.

1074
01:13:49,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Is there any online series of games, either completely online,

1075
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:08,000
or the focus of the community has been more generally online?

1076
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Let's say, for example, Call of Duty, where Call of Duty does have both single-player and multiplayer,

1077
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
but everyone likes to play online.

1078
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Sure.

1079
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Now, is there any series that the three of you really, really enjoyed playing online that has essentially died out,

1080
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:46,000
and there has been no entries into the series for a number of years that you want to see a revival in?

1081
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Well, I'm going to take the easy answer that I think Loki would say. Probably Final Fantasy XI.

1082
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:56,000
I mean, there still is a community in XI. I think many of it moved.

1083
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Much of it moved to Final Fantasy XIV, even though they are different types of games,

1084
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:05,000
but I know XI is looking to reinvent itself in a mobile type of way, which is interesting to me.

1085
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:08,000
I have concerns about that, but that was supposed to happen.

1086
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,000
They announced that a couple years ago. We haven't really seen anything.

1087
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Granted, it takes time to develop that stuff, so whatever, but I'm very curious to see what happens there.

1088
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Left Square Enix announced something that takes multiple years to develop.

1089
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Yeah, so that's why I'm kind of like, all right, I shouldn't really be surprised about this,

1090
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:24,000
but yeah, you know, because that was a game that I did spend.

1091
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,000
You know, Loki, especially, a lot of you may forget,

1092
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:30,000
because I know not all of you have been listening to Orange Lawns Radio for 15 years,

1093
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:34,000
but we've been doing this show for 15 years, and the first year was in a house,

1094
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:39,000
but then Loki and I became roommates for years two through maybe five or so,

1095
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:42,000
I don't remember, two through four, two through five, of this show,

1096
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:47,000
and we spent a lot of those nights, when we weren't doing OLR, playing Final Fantasy XI.

1097
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:50,000
Loki was in one chair playing him, and I'm playing, you know, and so, you know,

1098
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:54,000
and I made some great online friends through that whole experience.

1099
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,000
You know, I'm probably friends with Shane, who you hear a lot on this show,

1100
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:01,000
because of Final Fantasy XI. We played that a lot, and you know, other people do,

1101
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:07,000
so I know that wasn't a craze that Jamie got in on as bad.

1102
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:10,000
I think she, like, tried it for a little bit, but, right, you played,

1103
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:13,000
I remember you played XI, but you got really annoyed at all the,

1104
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Heal, please. Heal, please.

1105
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Well, it's just because I would throw my macro for people to come for healing.

1106
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,000
And then they never do it.

1107
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Because they're stupid bitches.

1108
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
That would involve people reading and listening to direction.

1109
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Let them die.

1110
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,000
I believe it was Marie Antoinette who said, let them eat cake,

1111
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:34,000
and I believe it was Jamie Summers who said, let them die.

1112
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Alright, anyway, so yeah, I guess my easy answer is Final Fantasy XI.

1113
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Do you have an answer for that, Loki?

1114
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,000
I miss-

1115
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Grand Theft Auto IV, because you were good at it.

1116
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:50,000
I do miss Grand Theft Auto IV only, because I like the style of how they set up,

1117
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,000
like, the death matches and that.

1118
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Grand Theft Auto V, it is a more open game, and I think there's a lot of,

1119
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:58,000
you know, advantages to that, because you can do a lot of different gameplay,

1120
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:02,000
but I do miss, like, the arena style death matches, where it's just,

1121
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,000
it's a set map, the weapons are in a set position,

1122
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:10,000
it's just getting good at that map instead of just it being everywhere,

1123
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
and fucking crazy, so I don't know.

1124
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Jamie, do you have an answer for this?

1125
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,000
I thought of a second answer, and I bet you would totally cosign this.

1126
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Go ahead.

1127
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Fantasy Star Online.

1128
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Yes.

1129
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,000
That, I miss that a lot.

1130
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Me too.

1131
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,000
I know a lot of people miss that.

1132
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:29,000
And Blue Burst was on PC, and, you know, it literally died, you know,

1133
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:33,000
because they pulled the plug on it, but the game does live on, I guess,

1134
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,000
maybe private servers, but I haven't looked into how to join one of those in a long time.

1135
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Can you really play Fantasy Star Online anymore, in any form?

1136
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,000
In any form?

1137
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,000
On Fantasy Star Online 2.

1138
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Which isn't even here, so.

1139
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,000
But it's fully translated.

1140
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Yeah, I guess that's true.

1141
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
And they don't care if you play on the Japanese servers.

1142
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Oh, really?

1143
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Yeah.

1144
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Oh, I thought they had issues with that at first.

1145
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
No, I've had an account for an age I just haven't played in a while.

1146
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,000
I need to just fucking play that already.

1147
01:17:54,000 --> 01:18:02,000
But I need to re-up my Final Fantasy, not Final Fantasy, but my WoW.

1148
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,000
World of Warcraft?

1149
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Yeah.

1150
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Yeah.

1151
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
You have to do that raid with me, because it's fun.

1152
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,000
What raid? The new one?

1153
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,000
No, no, no, no.

1154
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:12,000
The one that was, um...

1155
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Crap, what was the name of the character Jennifer Hale voiced in it?

1156
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:19,000
The queen elf lady, night elf lady, or whatever.

1157
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Uh...

1158
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Uh...

1159
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,000
God damn it.

1160
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Yeah, but it was...

1161
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:26,000
She's a character and hears the storm, too, and I can't think of it.

1162
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Yeah, it starts with an E.

1163
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Okay.

1164
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,000
But that...

1165
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,000
A loon?

1166
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,000
No.

1167
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,000
But the Gul'dan fight, and that's pretty fun.

1168
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Okay.

1169
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Anyway.

1170
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Alright, yeah.

1171
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:39,000
I haven't done Endgame and WoW in years, so it'll be interesting.

1172
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Alright.

1173
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Well, Rageinator, I'm gonna turn the tables on ya.

1174
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Is there an online game that you miss?

1175
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Oh, yeah, definitely.

1176
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Um...

1177
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:56,000
At least during the PlayStation 2 era, and to a certain extent, the PlayStation 3 era,

1178
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:01,000
I used to love the Jesus out of the Soulcom series.

1179
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Uh, I...

1180
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:09,000
You know, the Soulcom games and, of course, Final Fantasy XI, I used to play like no other,

1181
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
but I really, really enjoy it.

1182
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:16,000
If I had to pick between those two games, you know, I would...

1183
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,000
You know...

1184
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,000
You know...

1185
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:25,000
You know, well, Soulcom's a series, whereas XI's just a single entry, but, you know,

1186
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:30,000
I would probably pick the Soulcom over anything.

1187
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:39,000
You know, unfortunately, Sony kind of threw up the proverbial white flag with the Soulcom series.

1188
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:47,000
You know, because unfortunately, you know, well, you know, Soulcom 4 was the final game of the series,

1189
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:56,000
and unfortunately, it was poorly timed, because, you know, that was launched right when the PSN outage happened.

1190
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:06,000
So they lost a lot of sales because of that, and not only that, but Soulcom 4 tried to emulate the Call of Duty games,

1191
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
which were hugely...

1192
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:19,000
Well, still are, but hugely popular, and because of that, you know, the game kind of lost its uniqueness,

1193
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:33,000
where previous entries had, you know, but if they stuck to, you know, their roots with the Soulcom series,

1194
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:41,000
you know, pure Soulcom, you know, have plenty of maps, you know, new ones, classic ones,

1195
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:51,000
and released it on console, obviously, because Sony makes consoles, and maybe even put, like, a PC port on Steam or whatever.

1196
01:20:51,000 --> 01:21:03,000
I would definitely, you know, buy it, and if need be, if it doesn't come with a PC, then I would seriously consider getting a console and just play Soulcom again.

1197
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:11,000
You know, unfortunately, the older Soulcom games are no longer online anymore, they took down servers, so...

1198
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:14,000
They always do that, yep. That's exactly what's behind your question.

1199
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Hey, Jamie, by the way, I just got a text from Alan, while Rachael was talking there. Tyranda?

1200
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,000
No, it was, um...

1201
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Azshara?

1202
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:32,000
No, it's none of them. She was introduced in that comic about the... fuck, what kind of elves were they?

1203
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,000
It's fine.

1204
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,000
I'll look it up, hold on.

1205
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:40,000
Alright, you know what, we need, you need to get, we need to, if there wasn't an 8 hour time difference, we need to get Raven and EJ on the line stat,

1206
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:44,000
because they would know this answer like that. Our pals from Girls Gone Wild.

1207
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:47,000
Alright, anyway, Rachael, I'm gonna let you go so we can get some more calls, but that was a good question.

1208
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Elison.

1209
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Thanks, there it is, Elison. Alright.

1210
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Alright, have a nice night. Take care.

1211
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,000
You too, bye.

1212
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:58,000
Alright, OrangeLountRadio, all one word if you want to get on the show tonight, some other answers from chat.

1213
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:03,000
AkumaJP says, I miss goofing around in home. That's a good answer.

1214
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Uh, let's see, SSG100Matt says, I thought Jamie was gonna say MapleStory, but I guess you can still play it.

1215
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:12,000
Why don't, would Neopets be a valid answer to the question?

1216
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLountRadio, who's this?

1217
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
Hey, hey, it's Rama.

1218
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:19,000
Hey, Rama, I swear to God, if you have a link, I ain't clickin' it.

1219
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:23,000
I actually called to apologize about that, I didn't even know he was gonna react that way.

1220
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:26,000
It was disgusting!

1221
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:31,000
I just have it over on Twitter, and it was right there, I was just like, oh that's what he meant.

1222
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
You know I'm just giving you shit, what's on your mind tonight?

1223
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:36,000
I know you are, I know you are.

1224
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
You know me, what's on your mind tonight?

1225
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:42,000
A couple of things, number one, I finally got myself an Xbox One.

1226
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:49,000
Oh, congrats, did you do the Xbox One X, or did you kind of take the opportunity to get a cheap Xbox One S?

1227
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:55,000
I got the Xbox One S because, as powerful as X is, to me it'd be a waste of money,

1228
01:22:55,000 --> 01:23:01,000
because I wouldn't play the console enough to appreciate what it can do, plus my TV's about ten years old.

1229
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:07,000
Yeah, exactly, if you don't have the top of the line TV to go to the top of the line Xbox, not quite gonna be a match.

1230
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Somethin' like that, and I don't play games as much as I used to.

1231
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:20,000
My Xbox One, I'm gonna be playing three or four games on it, and streaming a lot of anime and Netflix and Hulu.

1232
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Speaking of anime, I'm glad you reminded me, because I did this whole Ingress thing this weekend, I totally forgot to mention,

1233
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:31,000
the other thing they announced, is that there is going to be an Ingress anime.

1234
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Yeah, they showed a four second clip of an Ingress anime.

1235
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Four second.

1236
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Four second, but again, the game is very big in Japan, so I'm not, you know, they have the vending machines and shit over there,

1237
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:46,000
so I'm not completely surprised to hear that, but I think that's really cool.

1238
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:51,000
That does sound like a great thing, but I just, I wonder now who's gonna pick up the rice to it,

1239
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:58,000
and I have a feeling it might be Viz, because Viz is right there in San Francisco, so.

1240
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Very true, and it will fill the void left by the Tron anime that only lasted one season on Disney XD, so.

1241
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Yeah.

1242
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:17,000
Bobby Blackwolf says, maybe they should make an anime based on Pokemon Go. I see what you did there.

1243
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
I won't play, son, I won't play.

1244
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:28,000
Well, maybe they kinda did, because with all this renewed interest in Pokemon, thanks in part to Pokemon Go,

1245
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:34,000
they kinda went back and they kinda redid the origin story of Pokemon. I don't know what the fuck else to call it.

1246
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:39,000
What else do you call Pikachu, I choose you? That's basically like a retelling of the origin story, right?

1247
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:46,000
Yeah, but you also gotta remember, the movies aren't canon to the TV series, so the movies can run in its own little universe.

1248
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,000
That's a good point.

1249
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:54,000
And let's not forget, when Pikachu spoke for the very first time, everybody lost their proverbial shit.

1250
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:58,000
What the fuck, are you printing your own anime over there? What was that?

1251
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:01,000
I'm printing the script to my porn, Rob.

1252
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:08,000
If you're going to cop an ad, I'm gonna cut out your cameo appearance.

1253
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,000
I'm sorry, sir.

1254
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,000
Alright.

1255
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:20,000
Yeah, I know, SD100matt in chat says, dot matrix printer. I know, it sounds like he's running the fucking print shop, printing a banner over there.

1256
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Okay, strong bad.

1257
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:38,000
But, I mean, it's an Epson inkjet printer, and I'm just like, you know what, I'm tired of buying Christmas labels and stuff for one and two bucks and losing them, so I'm gonna go out, I'm gonna buy some labels, buy some ink, make fancy labels, and print them myself.

1258
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:48,000
There you go, fancy. I wanna find, can I, can you find a copy of, like, the print shop, like, so you can actually make labels that look like they were made in the print shop? Can you do that?

1259
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
Yes, is there a Staples near you?

1260
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Oh, I'm sure there is, like 5,000 of them.

1261
01:25:53,000 --> 01:26:00,000
Go to Staples, go to the 999 rack, you will find print shop, a version from a year prior for, like, ten bucks.

1262
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:08,000
Okay, I'm gonna find that, cause I wanna see, well, I mean, I don't want a new, but I don't want it to look new, I want it to look like I printed it in 1986.

1263
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:11,000
And if you wanna be fancy, there's always Print Master Gold, so.

1264
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:31,000
Oh, fancy. Uh, let's see, also, uh, s2100matt in chat is kinda reminding me that maybe I should forgive you for the link thing, because you did send me Stroopwafel, and I think, Matt, you should hire Matt as your lawyer, because I, I think I will have to forgive you, because you did send Stroopwafel, so you are forgiven this time.

1265
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
Oh, thank you, good sir, thank you, thank you.

1266
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:36,000
Alright, my friend, I'm gonna let you go, but thanks for calling.

1267
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:37,000
No problem, dude.

1268
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Alright, bye.

1269
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:41,000
No, they still sell dot matrix printers that are actually USB.

1270
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Really?

1271
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:45,000
You can get one, they have one, I was looking at eBay here, uh.

1272
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
There's part of me that's like, why would I ever do that?

1273
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:53,000
An Okie Microline 490 dot matrix 24 pin USB printer.

1274
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Did they change the enlightenment logo?

1275
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:59,000
Like this eyeball thing.

1276
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:02,000
The green, little, kinda like.

1277
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,000
With the eyeball.

1278
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:06,000
The, you're talking about the swirly with the triangle in the middle?

1279
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
I'm talking about the triangle one, I'm talking about this one with an eyeball.

1280
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:09,000
Can you show me?

1281
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
Yeah, give me a second, I'll link it to you.

1282
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
Ok, alright, I thought you were just gonna flip your thing around.

1283
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:16,000
Alright, um, I have a few stories here.

1284
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:19,000
I can probably squeeze in one more call at Orange Lounge Radio.

1285
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
Yes, that has always been the enlightened logo.

1286
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
That's not the glyph, but that's the logo for the team.

1287
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:24,000
Ok.

1288
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,000
Yeah.

1289
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:26,000
I just always knew about the triangle.

1290
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:33,000
Right, because in the game, the glyph for enlightenment is, you draw like a half circle and there's a triangle.

1291
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
But to be fair, Resistance also has this problem.

1292
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:38,000
I call the Resistance glyph a four, because it kinda looks like the number four.

1293
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
Oh yeah, that's how I always remember it.

1294
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:43,000
And then, but the actual, their logo looks like a key.

1295
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Looks like a blue key.

1296
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,000
Yeah.

1297
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:46,000
Yeah.

1298
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,000
So, anyway.

1299
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:50,000
There you go, another Ingress fucking derailment on this program.

1300
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,000
We should start counting how many of those there are.

1301
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,000
Alright.

1302
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:55,000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

1303
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:59,000
If you can squeeze in here while I redo these last couple stories here.

1304
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:02,000
I had a couple of the quick things I wanted to point out here.

1305
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:09,000
Apparently some graphic novels on the way for games like Wolfenstein, Tekken, and The Evil Within.

1306
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:15,000
I hope they're as awesome as the FX9 novels from the 80s about Blaster Master and Simon's Quest.

1307
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Oh wait, but these are graphic novels, so I guess they'll be a little different.

1308
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
They'll be nothing but pictures.

1309
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:26,000
So, Wolfenstein Volume 1 is a prequel to Wolfenstein 2, The New Colossus, which I kinda laugh at that because I go,

1310
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:32,000
well, wouldn't Wolfenstein 1 be the prequels, but I guess it doesn't work like that.

1311
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:39,000
Tekken Blood Feud is coming out for the Tekken franchise, and The Evil Within, The Interlude.

1312
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:45,000
So, you can check that out if you're a fan of The Evil Within, which you may have forgot that the sequel was released last month.

1313
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:48,000
Or, no, we're in December now, two months ago.

1314
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:53,000
There is a Life is Strange bonus episode coming for Before the Storm,

1315
01:28:53,000 --> 01:29:00,000
and what's notable about this is that Ashley Burch will be returning to the role as Chloe Price's voice actress,

1316
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:05,000
because the strike, she didn't reprise the role in Before the Storm,

1317
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:10,000
but she will be doing this for a bonus episode, which I think is, that's pretty cool.

1318
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Square Enix kinda said, you know, Rihanna DeVri, I hope I said that right,

1319
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:18,000
who was the replacement voice actress in the time being,

1320
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:22,000
she did a fantastic job in the motion capture, we're thankful to her, blah blah blah,

1321
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:25,000
but we're gonna do Chloe.

1322
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:30,000
Oh, I guess Rihanna will still do the voice, excuse me, the motion capture,

1323
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:35,000
but the voice will go back to the original actress, so that's kinda neat.

1324
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,000
So you can check that out.

1325
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:45,000
And lastly, did you know that a certain video game turned 45 years old this past week?

1326
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
It was Pong.

1327
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:51,000
That's right, Pong Day was celebrated this past week.

1328
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:57,000
45 years ago, Pong came into the world, and Atari decided to declare the day Pong Day.

1329
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:00,000
I don't know what authority Atari has to declare anything right now,

1330
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:07,000
but sure, we'll roll with that, because obviously Pong was so important for where video games are at today.

1331
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:11,000
But I just wanted to remind you that Pong is now 45 years old,

1332
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:16,000
and you know what that means, you are also old.

1333
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,000
And on that note-

1334
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:18,000
But I'm not older than Pong.

1335
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:24,000
That's right, but some of our listeners out there might be older than Pong, and that's okay if you are.

1336
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
We love all our listeners. So there you go.

1337
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:32,000
Alright, that's gonna wrap it up for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio,

1338
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:33,000
because no other calls are coming in on Skype.

1339
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:36,000
I mentioned at the top of the show it's gonna be a shorter show tonight.

1340
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,000
We'll be back in seven days, though.

1341
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
I was gonna mention what's coming out this week.

1342
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:40,000
Oh, dude, we never got to release dates, did we?

1343
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,000
No, we didn't.

1344
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
I just figured there wasn't a lot. Sure, go ahead.

1345
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,000
So there is actually quite a bit coming out.

1346
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:51,000
So we've got seven The Days Long Gone on PC, Xenoblade Chronicles 2.

1347
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:54,000
Actually, I'm sorry, that was Friday last week, my mistake.

1348
01:30:54,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Okay, so this week we have Dead Rising 4, Frank's Big Package on PlayStation 4.

1349
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,000
We have Caveman Warriors on the Switch,

1350
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:07,000
Nine Parchments on PC, Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,

1351
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:10,000
A Hat in Time on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,

1352
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:13,000
Earth Defense Force 5 on PlayStation 4,

1353
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:18,000
Kamen Rider Symax Fighters on PlayStation 4,

1354
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:21,000
Spell Force 3 on PC,

1355
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:26,000
Yakuza Kiwami 2 on PlayStation 4,

1356
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:32,000
and finally Hello Neighbor on PC, Mac and Xbox One,

1357
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:37,000
and Tokyo Xanadu EX Plus on PlayStation 4.

1358
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:42,000
And I guess technically, although this would be like a Saturday release or something,

1359
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:46,000
LocoRoco 2 remaster on PlayStation 4, that's it.

1360
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
In the UK on December...

1361
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:52,000
Oh, sorry, because of PSX is this coming weekend, that's why you have a Saturday release.

1362
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Oh, sorry, just want to throw that out there.

1363
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:57,000
In the UK on December 5th, we have Dead Rising 4, Frank's Big Package,

1364
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:00,000
and on the 6th, Vostok, Inc. for Switch.

1365
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:04,000
All right, and I don't have the Japanese dates up, sorry,

1366
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
I was not prepared for the assignment, so...

1367
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
You are not prepared.

1368
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:13,000
That's right, so good stuff coming out in Japan this week, good stuff.

1369
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:17,000
All right, that is going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

1370
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:20,000
I want to thank you guys for listening, we'll be back in seven days

1371
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:23,000
for something a little closer to two and a half, maybe three hours.

1372
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:27,000
As we get into the holiday period, we still have to figure out what we're going to do for OLR

1373
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:31,000
celebrating the holidays, because I don't think we're going to do a show on New Year's Eve.

1374
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Christmas Eve, not likely either, so we'll figure something out,

1375
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
maybe we'll tape something in advance.

1376
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:39,000
But only a few more weeks until the end of the year, if you can believe it.

1377
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:42,000
And we get to open the time capsule. Aren't you guys excited?

1378
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:43,000
Oh my god.

1379
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:46,000
Did we put more shit in there?

1380
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:49,000
No, it's really old stuff from June.

1381
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,000
From June.

1382
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:57,000
So we have to, though, with the new year, we'll have to put stuff right from the start of the year.

1383
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:01,000
Oh yeah, no. The OLR time capsule will return in 2018, for sure.

1384
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Yes, in the Darth Vader piggy bank.

1385
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:07,000
Which I will be painting pink.

1386
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:12,000
No, because pink is really an unfortunate color, even though that's my hair color.

1387
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
I don't give a shit.

1388
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,000
Oh, you know what's funny?

1389
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:16,000
What?

1390
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
I hate the color pink, but what color is my hair?

1391
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,000
Pink.

1392
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:20,000
Right.

1393
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
Ergo, she hates her hair.

1394
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:30,000
No, I think it looks good on my head, but I hate it as clothing colors.

1395
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:32,000
Okay.

1396
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:36,000
What's it say about me? I like pink as a clothing color.

1397
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:39,000
I'm also trying to go for, like, more of a dusty rose color.

1398
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
Also, I fucking love my shirt today.

1399
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Yeah, Murder She-Ra.

1400
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,000
Yeah, it's-

1401
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Angelo Lansbury.

1402
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:48,000
It's a shirt that says Murder She-Ra with Angela Lansbury posed as She-Ra.

1403
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:54,000
Or if you are a listener of the RuPaul podcast, that would be Murder She-Dunge sat down in She-Ra.

1404
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
So there it is.

1405
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:59,000
Anyway, where were we? Oh yes, getting out of here.

1406
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:02,000
What happened to baby JJ?

1407
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:08,000
What happened was we were about to end the show, and then a commercial for Squatty Potty started.

1408
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:09,000
All right.

1409
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,000
What?

1410
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
That's it. Y'all are getting Squatty Potties.

1411
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:15,000
No.

1412
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:16,000
I have one.

1413
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:19,000
No, they have to pay for advertising. I swear I'm gonna go back and bleep that.

1414
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:22,000
They want to get on this podcast, they have to pay for it like they do everywhere else.

1415
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:25,000
I have one, but it's not a real Squatty Potty.

1416
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,000
Uh-oh.

1417
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:27,000
It's a naughty Squatty Potty.

1418
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:28,000
That's a naughty Squatty Potty.

1419
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
That's what we need to advertise as the competitor.

1420
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:31,000
Yep.

1421
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:32,000
All right, anyway.

1422
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
Sit down and shit.

1423
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:39,000
No, no, no. Instead of the Squatty Potty, it's the City Shitty.

1424
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:46,000
We want to thank you guys for listening to Orange Lounge Radio tonight,

1425
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:49,000
and if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio...

1426
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:51,000
Okay.

1427
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,000
Great.

1428
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:54,000
Great.

1429
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,000
That's great.

1430
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Good job.

1431
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
Once you pop, that's great.

1432
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
Good job, the cheat. Have a trophy.

1433
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:02,000
Good job.

1434
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
So if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio,

1435
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
tell a friend of five about the show,

1436
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:11,000
and help us spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,

1437
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:14,000
but if the voices aren't here, then that's less great.

1438
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
So get more people here.

1439
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:20,000
Advertise for us is basically what we're asking, because we don't ask for money.

1440
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:24,000
But we do ask for your five-star reviews on places like iTunes, Google Play,

1441
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
wherever it is that you found this particular podcast,

1442
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:30,000
because we're pretty much anywhere you can find podcasts except Stitcher,

1443
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:33,000
and if you want to know why, you'll have to go back in the archives.

1444
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
That's going to do it for another episode of the show.

1445
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:39,000
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

1446
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:42,000
Dark Sakura, do I need the FU music for your final thought?

1447
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:43,000
Not really.

1448
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Okay.

1449
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:47,000
To stupid little man babies on Twitter, guess what?

1450
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:50,000
You're wrong, and I'm right, and you're blocked.

1451
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
All I can think of is that GIF of Alyssa Edwards going,

1452
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
you're about to get blocked.

1453
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
Did you make a big tongue pop when you hit the block button?

1454
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
I did, and you know what's funny?

1455
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:05,000
Is that he follows like three people, and you're one of them.

1456
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
Apparently, you're following him.

1457
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
Yeah, I follow like 1,300 people on Twitter.

1458
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:10,000
Wherever.

1459
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:13,000
If I figure you're not a robot, I probably follow you back.

1460
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
I'm a little more choosy.

1461
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:19,000
But there are lots of really awesome people out there,

1462
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
and all of you people, you're not garbage.

1463
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:24,000
So, well done not being garbage.

1464
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:25,000
A plus.

1465
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:28,000
Number two, to my little sister.

1466
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,000
Uh-oh.

1467
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:34,000
Don't fucking tell a podcaster not to come for you.

1468
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
That's all.

1469
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:39,000
Are you going to come for her and cut her wigs up at night?

1470
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:42,000
All right, we'll just end there.

1471
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:43,000
You know what?

1472
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:44,000
No, no, no, here's what I'm going to say.

1473
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:47,000
I don't have to come to her because she's already fucked up her own life.

1474
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:48,000
Ooh!

1475
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
Do not allow dark soccer to drag you ever.

1476
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
All right, my final thought.

1477
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:55,000
I'll go next.

1478
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:58,000
My final thought is I've probably walked 50,000 steps this weekend,

1479
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:01,000
but I had a really good time meeting people

1480
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
and seeing people I don't get to see often enough.

1481
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
And yeah, we'll have to do this again.

1482
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:08,000
Niantic, hurry up and announce anomaly schedule for next year

1483
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
and try to make this sit.

1484
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:14,000
Please put something on the West Coast for quarter one.

1485
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
Because I already have a busy.

1486
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
Or if you're going to put it in Atlanta or something,

1487
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:22,000
try to plan it the week I'm already planning on going.

1488
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
That's all I ask.

1489
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
Loki, your final thought.

1490
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:32,000
My final thought is that I really need to finish my Lego mock that I was working on.

1491
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
Stupid triangular tables.

1492
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:37,000
Like the building I was designing or based on,

1493
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
they have tables inside of it.

1494
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:42,000
They're shaped like, I guess, like a triangle.

1495
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
And Legos don't do triangles very well.

1496
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:45,000
No, they don't.

1497
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:46,000
And it's been bothering the hell out of me.

1498
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:50,000
So I finally compromised to making them not triangles,

1499
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:53,000
but it's still taking me forever.

1500
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
I've been stuck on this stupid thing.

1501
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
All right, that's going to do it for tonight.

1502
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
Thank you guys so much for listening to our show tonight,

1503
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:02,000
and we'll see you in seven days, as will Mr. Smush.

1504
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:06,000
