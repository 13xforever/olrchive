6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Live today with episode number 712 for this December the 31st, the very last day of 2017.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
My name is Rob Roberts. Not joining us live here yet today is DarkSakura or Jamie Sommers.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
She'll be joining us over the telephone a little bit later on. But in studio we do have Techmaster Loki.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Hello. How are you Loki? I'm good. Happy New Year. Yes.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So real quick, just in case people forgot, we talked about this the last episode of the episode before, but we're actually live a little earlier today

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:18,000
where it's noon on New Years Eve and usually we do our show a little later at 6 o'clock, but for people's plans we figured, you know, let's do the show a little bit earlier today.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:28,000
But usually we tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network, vog-network.com, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And if you are listening live, even if you do happen to be here at noon, you maybe saw the tweet or something, you can join us in our chat room and we will be reading whatever comments are there.

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Our next live show, the regular stuff, will be January 7th, 2018, New Year. Anyway, so that's a little bit of housekeeping there.

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
But how are you doing today, Master Loki? I'm fine. Yeah, so this is interesting since we have an earlier show today, you brought somebody else to the show.

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Yeah, oddly enough he doesn't want to talk right now because he knew that you had a Switch and he wants to play the Switch.

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
That's fair, yeah. So yeah, I brought my son Josh. Yeah. And maybe he'll say hi later.

19
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
But right now he's too infatuated with Mario Odyssey, right? Yeah, he's too busy playing Mario Odyssey.

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:23,000
That's fine. That's understandable. Mario Odyssey is a pretty fun game. So anyway, we're going to get into some video game news here in a little bit.

21
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I don't think it'll be as long of a show as usual, but we'll try to squeeze in what's been going on around the gaming world.

22
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
But there are some things like, you know, there's no video game releases going on right now. It's a little bit slower of a time of year.

23
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I should go on over to our chat room, of course, over at live.vognetwork.com. ActDeft is in chat saying, Loki son, definitely.

24
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I don't know if that's because shy, but you're not shy. No, I think because he's playing video games.

25
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Playing video games, playing Mario Odyssey. He's busy at talk over video games.

26
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Choosing to do video games over another activity. That maybe makes a little sense. I get it.

27
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Alright, well, let's start at the top of the show here since it is New Year's Eve. It's the end of the year.

28
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,000
This is the time of year when people tend to talk about, oh, what are my New Year's resolutions?

29
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
For better or for worse. I know not everybody's into them, but I thought I'd ask anyway.

30
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Is there anything that you are wanting to accomplish in gaming in 2018?

31
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And I open that up to our chatters as well. Is there anything you want to accomplish in gaming in 2018, Loki?

32
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I do want to rebuild my DDR pads. I keep bidding on DDR machines, but they never end cheap enough.

33
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So I have now a full set of the acrylic panels from a DDR machine.

34
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Is that nostalgia for Dance Dance Revolution? The reason why? Or is that like I want to have exercise gaming?

35
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Well, yesterday I played laser tag in the first time in a while, and I'm sore after playing that.

36
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm like, dude, that's nothing. That is low impact. I need to get my ass in shape now.

37
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,000
That wasn't a yeah of agreement. That was a yeah of I hear you, I understand you.

38
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yeah, it's just like just to be like, you know, I do, you know, before it gets worse because it's only going to get worse and get harder.

39
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:29,000
So it's like I didn't realize, like, oh, yeah, I can't do DDR anymore because that's that's too hard, you know, to do what I used to do.

40
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
But now it's like playing laser tag is like, wow, I'm that sore after playing laser tag.

41
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
OK, so one game of laser tag. Backtrack a little bit.

42
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yesterday you went and you took the kids to go play. Yes, I took them to play their first game of laser.

43
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So walk us through that. So we went to Golf Land to play, you know, they want to play all the games there.

44
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And I said, no, I said, you're going to go play laser tag. And so we did that and they had fun.

45
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
They you know, they got laser tag like toys for Christmas.

46
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So they've been playing around with those, but they kind of like, you know, they're cheap and crappy.

47
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
So I was like, well, let's play with the actual laser equipment and go in the arena and actually play that and see all that.

48
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So they liked it. All right. But they're my August son's still a bit little.

49
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:18,000
He's, you know, just about to turn four. And so he got upset because he he lost track of where I was a couple of times.

50
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And so, you know, that made him upset. But, you know, he had fun.

51
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And for the most part, he was shooting me. I'm like, you got to shoot the other team, not me.

52
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Shoot the other team. I'm on your team. Is that something like repressed anger from.

53
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
No, it's just like it's funny. It's like it's I'm shooting you, daddy. Like whatever.

54
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
As long as he's having fun. I don't really care. So it was just all right.

55
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I mean, but the laser type that they have at Golf Land Sunsplash.

56
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I mean, granted, it's not Cuzar. It's it's really old like that.

57
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I like I played on that. Ironically enough, I played on that.

58
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Probably one of the first games that they ever had there because we actually got to do grad night at Golf Land before it opened to the public.

59
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
So I got to play laser tag there. Like one of their first games on brand new equipment.

60
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
And it was kind of crappy then. But now they're like really crappy.

61
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
They have these a system called Laser Runner, which is all right.

62
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Like the new the packs that they have on their Web site now look really nice.

63
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
The packs that they're using now looks like someone took. But this place was built in what, like 97 or 98.

64
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Yeah. It's like they haven't changed since then. Yeah.

65
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's just it's been the same equipment like the entire time.

66
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So, I mean, it looks like that they took a laser gun sprayed spray foam all over the crap of that and wrapped it with electrical tape.

67
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I mean, it's just like this big padded thing. All right.

68
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So you did the laser tag and you your kids were shooting you and you were shooting the other team.

69
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You did OK. But after it was done, you were just I was just a little bit.

70
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yeah, I wasn't really tired, but it's just like, oh, you know, my legs hurt from that.

71
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Like it shouldn't hurt. Did you stretch first? I did not stretch first.

72
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
But like I totally would, you know, like if there's a Q's are nearby every weekend, I'd be there all the time.

73
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Yeah. But it's just, you know, I don't know. It was fun.

74
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:14,000
But yeah, I do need I do want to build those pads just to utilize my arcade cabinet they have in the garage.

75
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And, you know, I've been buying equipment for it. Like I've got the sheet metal sitting out in my shed.

76
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It's been sitting there for years now. I've got the I bought the actual acrylic arcade arrows,

77
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:34,000
except three or four of them are like this custom printed stuff and it doesn't match.

78
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
But whatever. It's going it's just a thing you step on. So who cares?

79
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It doesn't have to look good. It just doesn't have to look at it. It's acrylic.

80
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Who cares of like the decal or the print on it is rubbing off or whatever. It doesn't matter.

81
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
So I thought you're putting this on YouTube or anything. Right. Exactly.

82
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So like all I would need now is just the lumber for it and just hardware, I think, and should build it.

83
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Now, will this be another project that you have finished where like you get the up and down arrow done,

84
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
but there's no left and right arrows? No, I would be able to get done.

85
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Like I the last like I've built pads like several times and the last ones I had,

86
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I had a problem with static electricity building up in them.

87
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
So it kept shorting out the controller board for it. So like it would work for two minutes

88
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
and they would just stop working until you shut the whole thing off and turn it back on again.

89
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
So now, you know, knowing more about that kind of stuff,

90
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I can ground it properly and have, you know, bypass that issue. So I don't know.

91
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
All right. Well, I will hope to do that.

92
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
So whether I get around to it or not.

93
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So constructing a new DDR exercise thing.

94
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And of course, and of course, the other thing that I've been painfully aware of

95
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
and been more so lately now that I've run out of things to build is I got to work on my game again.

96
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Yes, you do.

97
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
So that that's the other thing. It's been kind of in the front of my mind.

98
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Yes, you do. For me, I think everything as far as like my resolutions or whatever you want to call it go,

99
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
probably go around live streaming because I was doing really well for a little bit.

100
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You know, I got the affiliate status and then you guys all know I had a really bad year last year.

101
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And I think it just kind of stopped.

102
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:18,000
And like it's just, you know, you kind of get in a place where it's like, I don't I don't know if I feel like being extroverted,

103
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
because I think when you're kind of doing the live stream stuff, you have to be a little bit extroverted.

104
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Or at least I feel that you do.

105
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I mean, I realize some people live stream like literally nothing but just video of them playing.

106
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
But I feel like you got to have a little more interaction.

107
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
So it takes it takes a little more extroversion or whatever.

108
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
So sometimes I just don't always feel it, but I miss it.

109
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And I actually did a random live stream again this week, which was my first one in a month.

110
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,000
So that's something I kind of want to get back into, because I think I think I do have a lot of fun with the audience.

111
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
And especially like when it's things like Mario Kart and things you can play with the other people.

112
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I think those are some of the best streams that were done.

113
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
So you haven't played?

114
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I do.

115
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
No, I have not played that.

116
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:07,000
No, that is definitely on my agenda for things I want to do in the first couple of weeks of the year, because you speak so highly of it.

117
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Oh, no, it's incredibly frustrating.

118
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Yeah.

119
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I guess otherwise it's just catch up on the good old games backlog of which I have quite a bit.

120
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Oh, I should mention this as a little bit of a follow up to something I talked about six weeks ago or so.

121
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I've allowed the Xbox back on the network.

122
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Do you remember when my Xbox one used like 900 gigs of data or whatever it was?

123
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
By the way, I did I don't know if I ever mentioned this.

124
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I did hear from somebody either Twitter or email.

125
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I'm sorry, I forget who and where is a few weeks now, but somebody else reached out and said the same thing happened to them.

126
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
So it wasn't just me.

127
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Thank you very much.

128
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
But I did feel like it was probably quantum break.

129
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
That was the culprit in that whole thing.

130
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
So what I did, I win it.

131
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I just deleted quantum break.

132
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I was like, if I want to play it again, I'll, you know, just redownload it at that point.

133
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
But right now I deleted it and no problems.

134
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
The Xbox has been online. It's been well behaved.

135
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,000
So it was definitely something about that particular patch that was downloading over and over.

136
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's just a 900 gigabyte patch.

137
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I guess, I guess all that 4K for that 4K TV, I don't have.

138
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
No, I don't know if we'll ever know the solution.

139
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
4K, because that also happens to be how much your cable bill is that much.

140
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Anyway.

141
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
All right.

142
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Let's see.

143
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

144
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Speaking of 4K, Bobby Blackwolf in our chat says,

145
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
My 2018 gaming resolution is hopefully going to be 4K.

146
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Had the first two meetings with a local home theater installation company about a room in my basement.

147
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Holy shit, that's taking it seriously.

148
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Going to get professional installation.

149
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
That is, that is a man cave.

150
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
That is a supremo.

151
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Although, even though I call it that, it's not like I know Bobby's fiance and she's going to be like,

152
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Move, I want to watch Doctor Who in 4K.

153
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
So, even though I say that.

154
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Let's see.

155
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Dungeon Buster in chat says,

156
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
No huge resolution other than to hope for a better 2018.

157
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Well, ain't that the truth?

158
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I think there's a lot of us that are looking out for that.

159
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:20,000
This is the part of the year where I think a lot of your favorite shows would talk about their favorite game from the past year.

160
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Their game of the year, if you will.

161
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Their personal best game that came out in 2017.

162
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Whatever your criteria is.

163
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm kind of curious for you guys in chat what that game might be.

164
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
And, of course, I've got to ask Loki.

165
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
What would be your personal game of the year for 2017?

166
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I haven't played a lot of games this year.

167
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You kind of didn't, yet you still have this podcast.

168
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Yeah.

169
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
So, you follow gaming culture.

170
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Well, I bought a lot of games that I didn't play.

171
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
That's true.

172
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
You still buy the games.

173
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I still buy the games.

174
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I just didn't get around to them.

175
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I don't know.

176
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I'm trying to think back to all the things that came out of me.

177
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I guess I didn't even play through Zelda, really.

178
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
So, I mean, that's kind of bad.

179
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I'm sure that one of Zelda or Super Mario Odyssey would have been probably up there.

180
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
But I never played them.

181
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Well, you don't have a Switch.

182
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I don't have a Switch.

183
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
But I played enough of the kiosk.

184
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
And you got the Wii U.

185
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You have the Wii U Zelda, right?

186
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Yeah, we have the Wii U.

187
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Zelda and Wii U.

188
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
So, I mean, that's alright.

189
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
What the hell did I play this year?

190
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I don't even remember.

191
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I probably want to play more Skyrim again.

192
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
No, I would say...

193
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Let me think here.

194
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
So...

195
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I didn't realize this would be such a hard question for you.

196
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Yeah, I don't really...

197
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I didn't play a whole...

198
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I mean, nothing was really stand-out-ish to me.

199
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I guess South Park, just because that's the last thing I played.

200
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I mean, even that was kind of...

201
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It wasn't as good as the last one, I thought.

202
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I thought the first one was much better.

203
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
You know almost everybody out there is talking about what a great fucking year this was for gaming.

204
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Just for the record.

205
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
There was a lot of strong games this year.

206
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
So I think at some point you got to catch up on some of these games, for sure.

207
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Well, yeah.

208
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I mean, there was a lot of great games that came out, but I didn't bother...

209
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Well, because the first part of the year I was actually trying to work on my games.

210
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
So I did my things for that reason.

211
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
And then the latter half of the year is just like...

212
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I don't know.

213
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I'm too burnt out to play anything.

214
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
So even this fall, I picked up South Park.

215
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I picked up the LEGO Marvel Super Heroes game.

216
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
The LEGO Marvel Super Heroes game was just a grind, so it wasn't even that good.

217
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I don't know. I played a lot of VR in the beginning of the year.

218
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I can't think of anything that really sticks out.

219
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Alright.

220
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
For me, it's easy.

221
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
My game of the year for 2017 is Super Mario Odyssey, easily.

222
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:02,000
It kind of gets me to really enjoy 3D Mario games in a way I haven't.

223
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I don't know if I have ever.

224
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I was never as big on Mario 64 when it was first out as I think other people were.

225
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Although I certainly recognize why it's such a great game and why people really like it.

226
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
And I think a lot of the best parts of that game really shine through again in Super Mario Odyssey.

227
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:28,000
The fact that Mario Odyssey is a game that's very simple in nature, yet there is so much to see and do.

228
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
And it's like they kind of took that script that worked very well in Zelda.

229
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Although obviously all these games were in development for a long time, so it's not like they were copying off each other.

230
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
But I guess you see Nintendo in general taking this more open world approach.

231
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
And I think that worked really well in Mario Odyssey.

232
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Which I suppose is not too dissimilar from how Mario 64 originally was, really.

233
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
But I think there's something about having the boat and traveling back and forth.

234
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:03,000
And the fact that you open up more after you beat the main story and so forth.

235
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I kind of feel like it even gives it more of that sense of openness than I think I even felt when I did play Mario 64.

236
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Even the minimal online components where you have some of the leaderboards with friends and so forth.

237
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:24,000
And just the variety of costumes and especially some of the way they handle the retro 8-bit stuff and all of that.

238
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I think it just adds up to what was just a stellar gaming experience for me this year.

239
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Mario Odyssey absolutely will be my game of the year.

240
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Let me check and chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

241
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Let's see. Bobby Black Wolf in chat says most lists have Zelda, Mario, Cuphead, Resident Evil 7, Horizon Zero, Dawn.

242
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Player Unknown Battlegrounds came out on the 20th so that counts.

243
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Bobby also points out Persona 5.

244
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Act F says I would put Cuphead as my top 5. Yeah, Cuphead was great.

245
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Cuphead was a good game.

246
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Cuphead was, especially the art direction and the way they really did transform that whole 1930s cartoon style into what is essentially a shoot-em-up game.

247
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:16,000
It's great. That game is a stellar experience so it's definitely worth checking out if you haven't yet.

248
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Bobby in chat says I wasn't as big on Mario 64 either.

249
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
When Mario Odyssey got rid of the lives mechanic, that's what got me.

250
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I'm fine losing 10 coins if I die. I'm not fine if I lose one of my last 3 lives.

251
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Yeah, it is interesting how they changed that and I think since the game is more open, where do lives in that traditional sense,

252
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
going all the way back to the original Super Mario Brothers, where do lives fit in in that picture?

253
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Where does the story begin and end?

254
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Those lines are blurred a little bit so I think that's kind of why you have to get away from lives a little bit and look at instead

255
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
other ways to penalize the player if they die, which coins is a good mechanic.

256
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:04,000
It's also good too because a lot of the moons in the game that you have to get are very technical to get to certain places

257
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:12,000
and so it kind of allows you to challenge yourself to get to places because you know that the repercussion for failing is not that big.

258
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:22,000
So anyway, sorry, I was reading. So DarkSakura actually joined our chat room over at live.vognetware.com.

259
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I'm not sure how much of this I want to say because I would like her to be here to talk through this at some point,

260
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:35,000
but you could probably guess what one of her top 3 games would be based on certain franchises.

261
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I know! I was surprised too when she said Halo was her top franchise of the year.

262
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
You're just asking for a beating. You're asking for a beating.

263
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Whereas, I understand it can't be the classic game of the week, but to make your 2017 top game of the year, I mean, that is just...

264
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
She's gonna come back. She's gonna show back up here and you're gonna be dead.

265
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
And then I'm gonna have to explain why Loki's missing all these shows in a row. That's gonna be what happens.

266
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:08,000
So anyway, I think I will wait for JB to come back and let her reveal those herself, which I don't know if she'll be back next week

267
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:15,000
or in a couple weeks, but we'll find out. Anyway, let's see, going to chat over at live.vognetware.com.

268
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Now, something I will mention that JB's saying in chat, when Dan and I were first together, we kind of bonded over Mario 64 and Symphony of the Night.

269
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Well, there's certainly always going to be some games, I think.

270
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Obviously, I don't think there's anybody that's gonna dispute that Mario 64 and Symphony of the Night aren't really good games,

271
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:41,000
but I think there's always gonna be sentimental stuff. I think that you played maybe when you were younger or at a certain key time in your life,

272
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
and so maybe that's why you tend to like games maybe a little more than other people.

273
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,000
It kind of ties into what our pal Bobby has said on his show about Final Fantasy games for a long time,

274
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
that your favorite Final Fantasy game tends to be the one that was out when you were 12,

275
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:05,000
which, whether that exact science is true or not specifically for you, I think that age is tied to a lot of sentimental things,

276
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:12,000
so I think maybe those two kind of things are tied, is that you tend to, things that have a sentimental tie to them,

277
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
you're always gonna remember a little more fondly than other people.

278
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:22,000
And maybe, just maybe, y'all, when we talk about how we get in those, I call them fake arguments, I don't think they're real,

279
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
maybe they're real for you, I don't know, but when we talk about how Super Metroid, I believe, is the best game that was ever made,

280
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
yeah, there's probably some sentimental stuff that comes into that.

281
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I played that game a lot in college when I didn't have a lot of other stuff going on,

282
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
so I think there's, you know, for me, maybe that's got some sentimental stuff in it.

283
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,000
And Bobby already, you know, early announcing that his game of 2018 is gonna be Ni No Kuni 2.

284
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Very courageous, all these like big, you know, announcements today.

285
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
That's a big, that's hedging a big bet.

286
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
It's just crazy.

287
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
That game might get delayed again, we'll see.

288
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Let's see, VOG 338, somebody going a little anonymous in our chat, saying Mario Kart was my game.

289
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,000
So, yeah, well, you know, some people, I don't know if that's Mario Kart in the past, like a sentimental game,

290
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:14,000
or Mario Kart 8 on Switch was game of the year, because some people didn't discover it till this year,

291
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
because not everybody bought the Wii U.

292
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Did you see that news story this week about how the Switch lifetime sales in Japan have already exceeded Wii U's lifetime sales?

293
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
In just the less than a year it's been out.

294
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Yeah, I believe it.

295
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Yeah, I believe it too, but it's, you know.

296
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Which is still surprising, which we'll get to later, that certain things aren't implemented or done yet, Nintendo.

297
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Come on.

298
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Well, maybe we'll find a little more about that as we continue on with the show.

299
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
So, ActDeft also pointing out another game that I hear a lot about.

300
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Sonic Mania is definitely great.

301
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
DungeonBuster also saying Sonic Mania was so good in SSA 100M.

302
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Sonic Mania is in my top three game of the year.

303
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Yeah, I think a lot of people are very pleased with what happened with Sonic, for sure.

304
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Okay, let's talk a little more current and talk about our gaming weeks,

305
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
and then we'll get into some of the news that happened this week.

306
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Loki, I don't know, I mean, you already kind of mentioned you've been a little slower on the games this year,

307
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
but did you get to play any games this week? How was your gaming week?

308
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I didn't play any VR games, unfortunately.

309
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I did finish South Park, The Fractured But Whole, and then I started going into DLC stuff.

310
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:29,000
But, you know, having played The Sick of Truth, I think that was a better story than The Fractured But Whole.

311
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:37,000
The Fractured But Whole is funny, but at the end it just kind of seemed very rushed and just kind of like,

312
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I don't know. It was alright. It just wasn't as hilarious.

313
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Because the whole Sick of Truth was more of the kids playing this role-playing game type thing,

314
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
and this other thing going on in the background that was ridiculous.

315
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:59,000
And then this one was more about superheroes, and the thing that's ridiculous going on in the background

316
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
is heavily involved in what they're doing.

317
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:09,000
So it wasn't kind of like they're oblivious to this whole thing, or people are oblivious to what's going on.

318
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:16,000
It's just, I don't know, it was ridiculous. But just not as funny as the first game.

319
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
And then the DLC that I'm playing right now is kind of like this Danger Room thing, so it's just these really hard battles.

320
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
And it's just like a grind. There's not really any point to doing it other than,

321
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
oh, I beat this on really hard difficulty.

322
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I didn't even play that game on hard difficulty, because all it does is give the AI more...

323
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,000
It makes the battles longer, and I don't really want to sit there fighting all the time for a very long time

324
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,000
about the story to progress. But at least the Danger Room stuff, you have to play it on the highest difficulty.

325
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,000
It wasn't that difficult, it just took longer. I don't know.

326
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
It's alright, though. I like the game. I recommend it, but it's just...

327
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:02,000
If you're going into it thinking, the combat system's pretty good, but I think the story in the first game was better.

328
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Alright.

329
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
And then, as far as other games, I played more Pokémon Go and actually a little bit of Ingress,

330
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
because we can go in different parks, so I hit whatever portals are nearby.

331
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
New stuff. Here you go.

332
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Yeah, new stuff. But I'm gonna try to get into more things again next year.

333
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Okay.

334
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:30,000
To register participation with this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, smile.

335
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Mike Gaming Week. Well, I mean, I didn't play a lot of new stuff that I can think of this week.

336
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:42,000
It was mostly revisiting, especially a lot of Blizzard stuff, because I've still been playing a little World of Warcraft here and there,

337
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:48,000
although I did also play Final Fantasy XIV. See, I am kind of juggling both MMOs, because I went and I got that bear mount for Christmas.

338
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:54,000
This is super adorable. You ride this little bear and you throw presents at people. It's really cute, so I like that.

339
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,000
And then I was playing Heroes of the Storm, which I've been playing off and on for a few months now.

340
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:06,000
And then I finally played Overwatch, which I was actually streaming a little bit, and then there were some that I didn't stream.

341
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I was actually playing some Overwatch this week, so I was kind of getting back into that.

342
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,000
And again, it's this masterful thing that Blizzard has done through games like Heroes of the Storm.

343
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I start playing it going, and this is what kind of got me back in a while. I was like,

344
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,000
oh, playing Malfurion in Heroes of the Storm is kind of fun. I miss the Druid healing stuff, so I go play that.

345
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:31,000
And now it's with Heroes of the Storm, it's like, oh, playing Lucio and Junkrat is kind of fun, and I should go play Overwatch again.

346
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:37,000
So god damn you, Blizzard, for finding a really good formula that kind of works with all your properties.

347
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I guess I've just been lucky that I haven't been sucked into the whole Blizzard thing, because I tried Overwatch and I just never got into it.

348
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I tried it, and I bought it, and... no. Just not interesting.

349
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:54,000
See, it's controversial what I'm going to say, but I don't know if maybe the experience is different on console versus PC.

350
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
But then again, I know some people that swear by consoles and they love it.

351
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I play on PC.

352
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Oh, gee, I thought you played on console.

353
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I play with a controller on PC.

354
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Okay, now that's just weird.

355
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Well, I have a touchpad. I can't play keyboard mouse with a touchpad.

356
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I have a mouse, but I don't have any place to put a mouse on a couch, so I play with a controller.

357
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I mean, it's fine, I like a controller, but it's not that I keep dying or anything, it's just that I just don't find the game interesting.

358
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Let's see, going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Valagas in chat says,

359
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I'm with Loki on Overwatch, yet Act F says, I love Overwatch.

360
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Well, a lot of people love Overwatch.

361
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I'm not knocking it, it's a great game.

362
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
It's just, I can't get into it for some reason. I don't know.

363
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:49,000
TigerKlaue in chat says, I guess you could say 2017 was Overwatch's year, so much so they managed to get themselves featured in the upcoming Ready Player One movie for next year.

364
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Yeah, I mean, see, that's the thing.

365
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Like, Ready Player One, I'm ultra hyped for that.

366
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
That, I used to have, like, I used to be that way with games, too.

367
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Like, certain games would be like, oh my god, I can't fucking wait to play that game.

368
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Right.

369
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
You know, but it's just, not feeling it now.

370
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Red Dead Redemption 2, maybe? But I'm not even, like, I'm kind of cooling down to that game.

371
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
What is it? Is that, is that just, you know that you don't have the same time that you used to?

372
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Or is that this whole stuff that's happening with loot boxes?

373
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Well, it's just, I know that they're going to have a big online portion.

374
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Red Dead Redemption, I never was into it as much as Grand Theft Auto, but it was a great game.

375
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I just never finished it, or as I finished all the Grand Theft Auto games.

376
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:41,000
But, I don't know, I just, like, if they announced a Grand Theft Auto 6, I'd be pretty hyped for that.

377
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:49,000
It's just now, though, like, I'm a little disappointed that they didn't do any single player DLC for Grand Theft Auto 5.

378
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Because they had, like, planned some nice stuff, but then they made too much money online, and they're like, ah, forget that.

379
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
We're just going to put all our resources in the online, which is fine. Online's pretty good.

380
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Apparently, and there's a lot to do now, but I just haven't, I've been so out of it for a long time that, I don't know.

381
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Alright.

382
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Well, you know, I think with Overwatch, I think there's a lot of people that, you know, are still, or at least I'm kind of getting the sense, you know, reading blogs and people's personal game of the year and Twitter and stuff.

383
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
There's some people that are saying, you know, Overwatch was kind of my game of the year this year, too.

384
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:28,000
It's the game that I just play a lot of because they add maps, they add characters, they do different things in the competitive seasons.

385
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
They kind of, you know, kind of keep people engaged with Overwatch.

386
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
So for some people, it was kind of their game of the year 2017 and 2016.

387
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:45,000
That's just the interesting thing about the gaming world we live in now, how games metamorphosize and change through patches and either pay expansions or not pay expansions.

388
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Yeah.

389
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:53,000
So, you know, in many ways, I would say Final Fantasy XIV Stormblood, that expansion was one of the better things that was released this year.

390
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
But where does that kind of fit in, you know?

391
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Yeah. And then, like, also in a lot of the games I was looking forward to in the fourth quarter this year were ruined by microtransactions and stuff.

392
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Like, I was looking forward to the new Battlefront game.

393
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Like, it looked cool because, like, oh, hey, you know, the fact that you're playing, you know, the bad guy, which apparently, spoiler, you turned to the light side, like, immediately.

394
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I mean, it would have been better if you stayed on as the villain and that, like, that's more interesting.

395
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Yeah.

396
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
You know, but no, we didn't do that.

397
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,000
And then they ruined all of it with just, like, shoving this microtransaction stuff down your throat.

398
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:39,000
What? I still kind of think that, I think because of all this vast negativity and some of the things we're going to get into here at the top of the show, I think loot boxes are done for.

399
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I know you kind of still think that there's companies, maybe in free-to-play games they'll still be there.

400
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
No.

401
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I think they're done for. I really do.

402
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
They're not. I don't think so at all.

403
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
We'll see.

404
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I think they're going to still do this.

405
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
We'll see.

406
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
It's going to get worse.

407
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
That's going to be something for the time capsule for next year.

408
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
That will be for the time capsule.

409
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Which, by the way, some of you might be asking, why aren't you opening the time capsule tonight?

410
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
We want to do it when we're live at our normal time so we have, you know, our usual turnout here.

411
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
And we would like Jamie to be here so that we can all kind of do it together.

412
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
So, we'll do that at our first show back.

413
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Yeah.

414
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
But I will say, oh, I guess a little bit of housekeeping because we're going to get into housekeeping here.

415
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I am going to try to get more guests on the show in 2020.

416
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I know I always say that and then we'll get a bunch of guests and then it kind of fizzles out.

417
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
But certainly if you know somebody who's developing a game or somebody that wants to come promote, you know...

418
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Should we try to do another game jam?

419
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
And this time actually go through with it?

420
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
No.

421
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I would want to make sure it's defined a little better than it was last time.

422
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
So, we can talk about that.

423
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
But as far... and that's not a knock. It's just more like definition for like...

424
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,000
So that I don't feel like I'm holding the whole thing up by, you know, not participating in certain ways.

425
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
So, I just kind of want to...

426
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Well, how can we better quantify our role in that whole thing? That's all.

427
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Anyway.

428
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Shoot. Now you can...

429
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
There was only one entry that was never submitted.

430
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Yeah. Yeah.

431
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
To be fair, I said I tried to do something too and it was just...

432
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I did try to go in Unity and learn.

433
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I probably learned more about Unity than I knew before because of it.

434
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
So, I would say little accomplishment. Nothing else.

435
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
But anyway.

436
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I did finish one thing this year.

437
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I mean, it was a project for work.

438
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
But it technically was a built thing.

439
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
It was a tech demo and it was finished.

440
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
So, it's one thing that's somewhat finished.

441
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
There you go. Grasp the straws where you can.

442
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I'll take that.

443
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Anyway, I will say you can look forward to January 14th here on the show.

444
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
That is when I'm planning the Ladies of Ingress night.

445
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
So, that'll be fun.

446
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Hooray!

447
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
That'll be fun.

448
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
So, if you don't know much about that game, even though we talk about it once in a while,

449
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
we're gonna have a lot to talk about that night.

450
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
So, that should be fun.

451
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
And the gals that'll be here are really funny.

452
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
So, it's gonna be a fun show.

453
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Even if you don't play that game and you don't really give a hoot about it,

454
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I think you'll have a good time.

455
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Did you find Pepper or anything?

456
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
We couldn't gain one on the blue side?

457
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
There's too many green people that want to come.

458
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
It's gonna be as fair and balanced as Fox News that night.

459
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
That's all I can say.

460
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Well, here's my thing.

461
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I don't want to talk about stupid drama, faction war stuff.

462
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I don't want to talk about that other stuff.

463
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:18,000
This show is really highbrow and so I'm trying not to bring it down with that other stuff.

464
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
So, yeah.

465
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
We're gonna just keep it focused on accomplishments and positives and all that good stuff.

466
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Alright, anyway.

467
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Where was I?

468
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Oh, yes.

469
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
We're gonna get into...

470
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Oh, I guess as far as other housekeeping goes, there's no shows off that I know of coming up.

471
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
We should be here pretty regularly on Sunday nights.

472
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I don't even have any conventions scheduled until August, really, at this point.

473
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
So, I don't know.

474
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I don't know if I'll be doing anything early next year.

475
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
We'll kind of see.

476
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I'm not doing Nightfest, sadly.

477
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Oh, yeah.

478
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
The indie arcade will be in April.

479
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
So, there'll be that.

480
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Hopefully.

481
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I mean, I haven't had confirmation on that, but I'm pretty sure it's gonna happen.

482
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
So, that'll be good.

483
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Oh, and Bobby says March 25th.

484
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
That's not a gaming convention.

485
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Oh, right.

486
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
But I'm gonna be out of town that Sunday anyway.

487
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
You're right.

488
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Okay, so that's...

489
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Yeah.

490
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
The end of March will be a show that will be missing for not a convention reason, but

491
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
personal reasons.

492
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Yeah.

493
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Alright.

494
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Anyway, in the meantime, let's get into some gaming news, talk about what's going on in

495
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
the gaming world.

496
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Okay.

497
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
So, let's start off with an extremely positive story.

498
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Okay, just kidding.

499
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
It's not extremely positive because it's 2017.

500
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,000
So, you may be familiar with swatting the whole thing where if you don't like what someone's

501
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:37,000
doing, you call in a fake police report and the swat arrives at their house and scares

502
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
them.

503
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Oh, it's so hilarious, isn't it?

504
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,000
So, apparently there was a couple people that were involved with a Call of Duty match where

505
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,000
they had a bet of $1.50 running on the match and apparently they lost.

506
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,000
And there were words had between them and they started arguing.

507
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,000
And so, apparently the one guy threatened to swat the other guy and so he got this guy

508
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:06,000
by the name of Swatastic to swat him.

509
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:15,000
And the player, I guess Miracle, he had taunted the Swatastic guy because he was trying to

510
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
dox him to get his address.

511
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
And so, he said, well, here's my address, come swat me.

512
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
You're just going to get jail time if you do that.

513
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
And so, he did.

514
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
He swatted him and come to find out it wasn't his address.

515
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
And so, what happened?

516
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Well, the police arrived.

517
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:40,000
The guy that was at the house heard a commotion outside, opened the door and was shot to death.

518
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
And so, now he's dead.

519
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
His children don't have a dad anymore.

520
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,000
And this guy basically thought he got away with it.

521
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Well, then he went on to Drama Alert, a YouTube channel, and bragged about what he did and stuff.

522
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:02,000
And then, finally, the LAPD did catch him and so now he's under arrest.

523
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
So, I hate that this story is tied to video gaming.

524
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
No offense, I realize it's something a lot of blogs and people are talking about.

525
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,000
And that's what we bring to the table each week, even if it's not, hooray, a new game being released.

526
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:25,000
But it really sounds like this whole video game thing is completely secondary to the other issues going on here.

527
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Because it could have been $1.50 on a sports game.

528
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:33,000
It could have been $1.50 on a You Got Served dance battle.

529
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
There's a whole lot of people to blame here.

530
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I mean, first off, this guy brags about swatting MLG events and stuff like that.

531
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,000
He thinks it's funny to have people evacuate buildings and watch it on TV.

532
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Well, what a bunch of, and I hope your kid isn't listening so say this quietly,

533
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
but what a bunch of fucking assholes just being fucking assholes.

534
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
That's what this is. This is just a story about assholes being assholes.

535
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:04,000
And it's horrible. It's horrible what's happened that an innocent person basically got killed in this whole thing.

536
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
These are grown adults that are doing this kind of stuff.

537
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:12,000
And I don't think anybody in our audience really does this or is into this or whatever,

538
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,000
but my plea would be to anybody out there is don't watch these YouTubes.

539
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Don't support these things. Call people out when they're being stupid about this swatting stuff because look at what happened.

540
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:30,000
And the guy wasn't even involved in it. The guy that got killed is a complete innocent bystander.

541
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,000
And it's not like this is the first time swatting has happened. We've seen this stupid stuff happen on Twitch

542
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:40,000
and throughout all the drama that's happened in gaming in the past couple years and so forth.

543
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,000
It's not like this is the first time. But unfortunately, I think a lot of people said at that time,

544
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
what's it going to take for people to take this seriously? Is somebody going to have to die?

545
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Well, here we are. We've reached that point because nobody took it seriously before.

546
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:02,000
And now it sucks. And I'm sorry to be so bleh about it, but that's the reality is here we are.

547
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:09,000
You know, thank God this guy is in jail. You know, he should be spanked publicly.

548
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Naughty, naughty, naughty. Actually, more than that. But anyway, I'll leave that to the...

549
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:21,000
The guy that called it in was 25 years old. It's like a grown adult.

550
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,000
It's just I don't understand how these people are out there.

551
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
You know, and his like he was, you know, like I said on Twitter, he was kind of saying, you know,

552
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:34,000
I didn't get anyone killed because I didn't discharge a weapon and being a SWAT member isn't my profession.

553
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,000
And yeah, the police, I think, are a little bit to blame here. Well, they're definitely to blame here, too,

554
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:45,000
because what did you expect was going to happen? You're making a commotion outside, you know,

555
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,000
and the guy opens the door unarmed to see what's going on and you immediately shoot him.

556
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:56,000
You don't say, hey, get down on the ground or anything like that. It's just that open fire.

557
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
A whole nother issue, I think, that needs to be explored, too.

558
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:04,000
But much bigger than what this show can get into, you know, that type of thing.

559
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,000
But obviously there's just a lot of like stuff in the story where it's like this all sucks.

560
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:16,000
All of it. It sucks. And as in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com,

561
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Valagis in chat says we gamers get trashed again because of an a-hole.

562
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Yeah. And that's what it is. And that's unfortunately why we have to bring it up on this show.

563
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,000
But I think it's an opportunity for us to kind of say, OK, this ain't funny.

564
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,000
And I'm going to let other people know it's not funny and I'm not going to follow it and I'm not going to support it.

565
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,000
And that's kind of what MXC in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says.

566
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:47,000
This is disgusting. And I'm glad I don't understand why or I'm glad I don't understand why anyone finds it humorous to do this stuff.

567
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,000
It's not. They had a was an interview with the I don't know who it was.

568
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
It was like the the wife or the sister or something like that, basically.

569
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:03,000
So after they because they called him basically that he was in a hostage situation, is holding his family hostage.

570
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
And he was I don't know if he had killed somebody or something like that.

571
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,000
So basically they took down who they thought was the hostage taker.

572
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:19,000
And then they made they arrested the hostages as well and had them walk over their dead dad, like step over their dead dad.

573
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:29,000
And as they brought him outside, it was like like kids. Like it just the whole thing sounds like it was handled terribly.

574
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I don't know. I mean, I understand, though, that a lot of law enforcement has to take some of this stuff seriously, because what if it was a serious situation?

575
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Right. You don't want to, you know, the boy who cried wolf, that type of situation.

576
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Well, you don't want to shoot first, ask questions later.

577
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I definitely agree with that element of that.

578
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Because how many times have we had problems with that or just over, you know, an excessive force being used in situations?

579
00:39:53,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Yeah. Anyway. All right. That's it. I don't want to talk about stupid people doing horrible, horrible things any longer.

580
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Let's move on to something that actually really does impact gaming. And this could be setting an interesting tone for 2018.

581
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:15,000
And it's a new rule out of Apple. Apple and this kind of quietly. I say quietly because, well, I mean, obviously blogs are picking up on it.

582
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:20,000
But that kind of happened in that slower holiday period. And so I'm not sure everybody's really picked up that this has happened.

583
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:29,000
But Apple has put a new guideline for games coming to the App Store. And this is targeting, I suppose, microtransaction.

584
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:42,000
As part of the new policy, which you can see on Apple's website, Apple will now require games on the App Store that features microtransactions and loot boxes to disclose the possibility of winning a certain loot or item.

585
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Where we've heard this before, which was the big China law that some people have been talking about.

586
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Good. I think it's a great thing that they're doing.

587
00:40:49,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Yeah. So anyway, the rule specifically states in the guidelines for App Store approvals, quote, apps offering loot boxes or other mechanisms that provide randomized virtual items for purchase must disclose the odds of receiving each type of item to customers prior to purchase.

588
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:18,000
So does that mean that they have to disclose it like an end user license agreement or like when I go to purchase that loot box that says it pops up a screen showing me the odds of everything?

589
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:29,000
That's a really good question. And unfortunately, I don't think it's really clear. It's not clear here. So we'll have to see what kind of happens from what Apple starts accepting from what they don't start accepting.

590
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Now, this same policy doesn't show up on the Google Play Store. But since most people kind of have to do their apps for both these days, right, if you really want to get everybody, you got to do Apple and Google, although some things get away with it.

591
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Like HQ still is on Android, right? That game's a big frickin' deal. And it's still not an Android, right? Or it's going to be soon? I don't know.

592
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:58,000
And then some things, you know, like with Mario Run came out on iOS first and then with the Fire Emblem thing was out on Android first. You know, some things, but eventually they're kind of out for both.

593
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:10,000
But my point is, is that even though Google doesn't have this rule, like it's probably going to start showing up even if you have an Android device just because programmers are just going to make the same game for both.

594
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Well, no, not necessarily. I don't think that they'd volunteer that information. I think that they'll only show it if they have to. What I could see them implementing that is if they start having more pressure from like the ESA is going to really put any pressure on them.

595
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:39,000
But it's like, you know, this whole movement right now with government where they're trying to, I think, put out a Senate bill or something like that saying, hey, we need to crack down on these loot boxes because there's several states now led by Hawaii.

596
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
I thought Hawaii was doing that in Hawaii.

597
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:58,000
No, there's other congressmen that are actually working on it as well. Or at least they have support by other states. So it may start in Hawaii and then may move on. So who knows?

598
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:03,000
That's another reason why I'm thinking loot boxes are kind of done, but we'll see.

599
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
We'll find a way around it.

600
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Anyway, over in chat, over at live.vognetwork.com, actf says that's a good rule. Dungeon Buster says if you have to start somewhere with self-regulating loot boxes, one could say Apple is as good and as big a proponent as any.

601
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:31,000
So that's another interesting angle is that is Apple doing this to quote unquote self-regulate to stop maybe a lot of this talk about Hawaii, et cetera, getting in on a movement to regulate something?

602
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Maybe. I think that could be a huge part of it, too.

603
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Well, interesting. It'll be interesting to see how this could affect games in 2018. We haven't really seen the results of this yet because then Apple kind of went in that dark approval, which is normal.

604
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Between Christmas and New Year, there's not really a lot of approvals getting through. But I think as we get into January, I'm assuming that if games want to do updates, they're going to have to conform to this, right?

605
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:07,000
I mean, maybe the games that are already out there are going to stay out there, but now games as they update are going to have to implement this. So it's going to be interesting to see how that changes things in 2018.

606
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
We'll see. All right, moving on. Next story, Loki.

607
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:23,000
So you remember that whole kind of Easter egg that they had in the Switch operating system that hid the game Golf, the NES game Golf in there?

608
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
It was the tribute to Iwata, right?

609
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Yes, the tribute to Iwata. Well, apparently they are removing it. So according to hackers, data miners, I should say, the Switch update 4.0 takes the Flog code that was in there, removes all of it and the executable and overrides it with garbage data.

610
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:59,000
So that's kind of unfortunate. So I don't know what the point of that is. Why? Was it because they didn't know that was in there? It was like some coder hid that in there and they didn't like it? I mean, that's kind of lame. I don't know what the point would be behind that.

611
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Yeah, I'm not sure why. Maybe they got frustrated at how much this was taking off when it was supposed to be kind of like a hidden tribute type of thing. Or maybe they realized they could charge for this. I don't know. That's what the cynical side, I think, says a lot of people.

612
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,000
It's golf. Come on. We're missing out on that $10.

613
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:33,000
The golf on the NES was, you know, it's not a game that aged gracefully. Back in the day, you know, it was golf. It was about as good as you could get, but it hasn't aged gracefully compared to a lot of stuff today.

614
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:56,000
That's like removing nibbles or gorillas from, you know, Q Basic 5 and DOS or something like that. It's like, they're shitty. It's a shitty game that's super old that, who cares? You've made your money. You've made your money on that. I hope it's not financially motivated because if it is, that's super lame.

615
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:09,000
So Bobby in Chat is saying that it was supposed to be a blessing never to be unopened. It's part of the Japanese custom, and it's not about money or anything like that. It was kind of supposed to be removed because the data miners opened it.

616
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:18,000
So basically, it was intended to be hidden the whole time, and because it got opened, it's like Pandora's box got unleashed or whatever.

617
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Then don't make a way to activate it. That's so dumb.

618
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Well, Loki, I kind of get it. I actually kind of get it. It was a hidden secret thing. But here's the thing. At the end of the day, this is what I will agree with. At the end of the day, okay, they buried this thing and they made it very hard to get to because it was supposed to be a blessing and all that stuff.

619
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:48,000
But at the end of the day, somebody forgot that rule, and that is hackers gonna hack. Right? So of course somebody was gonna find this eventually. So, you know, that's the whole thing.

620
00:46:49,000 --> 00:47:01,000
I understand why maybe it was supposed to be the secret thing that wasn't supposed to get out, and then when it got out, it became about, ooh, hidden game, and not about, it's a tribute, actually, type of thing.

621
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Don't mod it and put it back in there.

622
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Yeah, that's interesting. You say that tongue in cheek, but I bet you people will.

623
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:22,000
There was, and I was seeing some of the chat on Discord. I didn't put it in our, which by the way, just a plug for our VOG Network Discord if you're not there. It's a lot of fun conversations like this one, vognetwork.com slash Discord.

624
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:31,000
I was seeing that there's been a lot of advancement in Switch Homebrew this week, and there was a full, I didn't get a chance to watch that whole YouTube, so that's why I didn't want to bring it up totally on the show tonight.

625
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:37,000
But they have made some much bigger strides in getting Homebrew to actually work on the Switch this week.

626
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:45,000
You know, so even though you say that very tongue in cheek, oh, they'll just put it back? Well, we're getting closer to that being a reality, really.

627
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Yeah.

628
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Yeah.

629
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Anyway.

630
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Let's see, so Bobby found the whole little explanation he wanted to copy paste here, saying,

631
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:06,000
It's because the Flog was intended to be a omamori for Iwata or an amulet asking for a blessing. You don't open an omamori or else you lose its blessing.

632
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:13,000
When people found the Golf Iwata tribute, they opened the omamori. Omamori are replaced yearly, traditionally.

633
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Oh, interesting, so maybe there's a new one in there. No, that might be taking it too far.

634
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
They don't make a way to open it.

635
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:28,000
And that's the thing, I get it, I totally respect that, I understand that, but did you think you were gonna sneak a game in the hardware and somebody wouldn't find it?

636
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Like, again, hackers gonna hack, right? So, like, it was gonna get opened.

637
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Yeah.

638
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:42,000
We'll see. It'll be interesting to see maybe if Golf ends up on this whole Nintendo thing that's coming in the next year or what they do there, but...

639
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:52,000
It could be. It could be on their online service, and since we'll never be able to open it because it'll never come out, the tradition lives on.

640
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Now you're being mean.

641
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Alright.

642
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
I'm just being realistic.

643
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Alright, let's talk about some Sega hardware. Woohoo! We like Sega.

644
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Since, you know, a lot of people are talking about, you know, SNES Classic and all that stuff this holiday season, let's talk about Sega hardware.

645
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Well, there are some new systems coming out, not like a brand new Sega system, don't get too excited, but apparently this is the Retro-Bit Micro console, the folks that make the Retro-Bit console.

646
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:31,000
They are teaming up with Sega to do new products based on the Mega Drive or Genesis, the Saturn, and the Dreamcast. Yeah, that could be awesome.

647
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
So we might actually see Dreamcast games on one of these.

648
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Yeah, because I could care less about the Sega, Genesis, or the Mega Drive because those have been out forever.

649
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
That's true. They have re-released those in boxes.

650
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Several times, and they're trying to get in on that, that we, the NES and SNES Classic mini money.

651
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Actually, nah, those Genesis things were out before that.

652
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Right, exactly, but now they're trying to get in on that.

653
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Okay, that's fair.

654
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
They're trying to figure out, but like, Dreamcast and Saturn, yeah, maybe I'm bored with that.

655
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Yeah, oh yeah, for sure. I think especially with Dreamcast, especially, oh my gosh, if I could play Phantasy Star online again, I'd be so happy.

656
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:11,000
I'm not gonna go that far to expect that that'll be there. I think it'll be stuff more like, you know, Crazy Taxi, and I don't care.

657
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:15,000
You know, Space Channel 5, hey, I'm in for that, why not?

658
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Anyway, so, Retro-Bit is promising to retain the original formats, but also doing upgrades like USB and Bluetooth.

659
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Apparently, CES 2018, which is, what, it's only about a week away.

660
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
A few weeks away.

661
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Yeah, it's the first weekend in January, I think.

662
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:35,000
We're gonna see more about this. They're saying they will tease that there, so that'll be very cool.

663
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:42,000
So, maybe, maybe next year's big thing will be the Dreamcast mini. Who knows? We can dream.

664
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:49,000
But, I mean, the thing with those retro Sega Genesises and the Atari flashbacks and stuff is that you could really find those really easy.

665
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:56,000
They certainly don't have a, in fact, with the flashbacks, I think they might make too many of those, because I usually see those on sale at some point.

666
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Yeah, they're all over the place.

667
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Yeah, they are, so. Alright, one more story for you, and then we're gonna get to the classic game of the week. Loki.

668
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:12,000
So, Universal Studios keeps putting out all these different rides based on video games, so now Universal Studios Japan is finally getting a Final Fantasy ride.

669
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:24,000
And, I guess they said, starting January 19th, the Final Fantasy is getting a roller coaster at Universal Studios Japan called Final Fantasy XR Ride.

670
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:35,000
It's a limited time ride, part of, I guess, their Cool Japan event. And, it'll be a VR-enabled roller coaster.

671
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Pretty neat. And, I guess it's gonna end its run on June 24th. But, they have pictures of Sephiroth.

672
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:55,000
I think it's supposed to be a bunch of the different Final Fantasy games you travel through, because I guess Lightning's in it too, and some of the other characters.

673
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
So, I guess you travel from one fantasy to another.

674
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
This is the roller coaster.

675
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Well, we have that release on PS4 coming up, so maybe.

676
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Am I gonna go down a big hill and then run through Aerith as I go?

677
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
One can hope.

678
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Like, it's the total Sephiroth simulator there?

679
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:18,000
We won't know until people ride the ride. But, that is interesting. It's an interesting way to do it, especially with the whole VR coaster.

680
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:23,000
I haven't been on one yet here, but I know they just put one in at the nearby Six Flags...

681
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
They still call it Six Flags Marine World. What the hell is it called now?

682
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
I'm so old and I'm cool.

683
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Animal Kingdom or something?

684
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Whatever it is. The one in Vallejo. Or, as I like to say, Valley Joe.

685
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,000
The one in Vallejo has a VR coaster they just put in.

686
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
The thing about that is, okay, cool, you can do the VR stuff.

687
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:46,000
But, because a lot of that is also software-based, it's not like you're having to lay all this new track.

688
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,000
You can kind of generate a new... I make it sound like, oh, you just do it overnight.

689
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Obviously, no. It takes a team of graphics programmers.

690
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:59,000
But, probably still less people than it would to actually go out there and lay a new track to do a new coaster and tear the old one down.

691
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Yeah, because they have all the motion data already in there and they're just re-skinning it, which is kind of cool.

692
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Yeah.

693
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Looking in chat, Bobby Blackwolf says, Six Flags Over Georgia has a VR coaster.

694
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
It's a regular coaster, but you can opt to wear a Gear VR.

695
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Yeah, I think that's kind of what the Six Flags thing here is, too.

696
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
So, maybe they put them in a lot of different ones.

697
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:26,000
It looks cool. I mean, they've got them fighting and Seth Roth looking into this Japanese woman's eyes very lovingly as he murders...

698
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Oh, and Chocobos. That was short. That was 15 seconds.

699
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Well, I'm curious to see what this looks like and, you know, what they might kind of rotate in and out at different places.

700
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
I would like to see if it would come to Universal Studios over here as well.

701
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
It's all about Mario Kart VR whenever that comes out.

702
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Well, Mario Land's going to be a real thing.

703
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
I know. I won't play that.

704
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Or Super Nintendo World, whatever they're calling it.

705
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Anyway, we're going to take a trip to old school land right now.

706
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,000
I'm going to say what we call the classic game of the week.

707
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Every week, Dark Soccer jumps into the gaming vault, finds a game that she thinks, hey, you brats should check this game out and do this.

708
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:15,000
So, we're actually going to get her on the line right now through the magic of the telephone so Dark Soccer can actually tell us the classic game of the week.

709
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
And hopefully, she doesn't ignore the call because it's a weird number.

710
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Oh, I think we have her there. Hi, Jamie. You there?

711
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Yeah, I am.

712
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Hi. Welcome to the show.

713
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Hi.

714
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Hi. Good to hear from you. I hope you're doing well.

715
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Um, okay.

716
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Yeah, alright. Are you sure you're good to do this segment tonight? You sound a little like you want to go back to bed.

717
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Well, you know what? I was in bed and everyone kept waking me up with text messages.

718
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Oh.

719
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:49,000
So, I just got up and I'm a little bit on coding right now.

720
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:56,000
So, we get to spend the last classic game of 2017 on drugs. Hooray.

721
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Yay. Don't do drugs, kids.

722
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,000
How appropriate considering what's happening here tomorrow in California.

723
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:08,000
If you haven't already heard, a proposition that was passed a year or two ago is finally taking effect.

724
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Oops, that was supposed to be your classic game.

725
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
I think it's just...

726
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
It's your classic commercial?

727
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Classic commercial because I was an idiot and didn't have a password. Sorry about that.

728
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
What were you going to say, Jamie?

729
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
I think I'm just going to grow some bud in my backyard just because I can.

730
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Just because you can.

731
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
It'll grow in my fairy garden.

732
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:30,000
So, Jamie, one thing I did not mention, I did see an article regarding it, though.

733
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:38,000
But they have, and I haven't downloaded it yet, because I just found out about it yesterday, but they have a VR Danganronpa thing.

734
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:43,000
They've had a VR Danganronpa thing for a while.

735
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Oh, since I have you on the line, I was going to wait until you were back in studio to do this.

736
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,000
But you did send them to me in a message, so maybe you do want to get it out there tonight.

737
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Before we get to the classic game of the week, would you like to share quickly your favorite game of 2017 and why?

738
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Well, I have the top three, but one of them is really more favorite than the others.

739
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Okay.

740
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:13,000
So, I would say that Breath of the Wild is my game, because we've already played through it on Wii U, and then I won the Switch at work.

741
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:20,000
So, we're playing through it again, and we've got all these Amiibo cards that I bought on Amazon.

742
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:27,000
So, we're trying to get all of the special goodies from the other games, and it's really fun.

743
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:35,000
It's revitalized our love for the series, so that's been getting more attention from me, I think,

744
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,000
except the fact that I've been going back and playing Dragon Age Inquisition a lot.

745
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:48,000
I'd also like to give the honorable mentions to Danganronpa Z3, even though I haven't gotten very far in it, because it's Danganronpa.

746
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:55,000
What else came out this year? Mass Effect Andromeda? I think it came out this year?

747
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Yeah, it did. You had that on your list you sent to me.

748
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Yeah, I played it a good bit. I really like the Legion WoW expansion, to be honest, although right now I don't have enough stability to play it right now.

749
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
That's fair. Codeine, it's fun.

750
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:18,000
But I like floating around and breaking old dungeons with my Demon Hunter. That's pretty fun.

751
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
There you go.

752
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:32,000
And I really do like, as far as IOS releases, I really do like the Animal Crossing Pocket Camp. That one's pretty fun.

753
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:38,000
I really enjoyed it, and I really play a good bit of it every day.

754
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
I have to be honest, I kind of gave up on that. Is there still a lot to do in that?

755
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Oh yeah, they put out the flowers, and you can crossbreed your plants, and I'm trying to have a garden of nothing but black tulips, like my soul.

756
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Fair enough. Well, let's get to the Classic Game of the Week for this week, which has nothing to do with any of these games we've talked about.

757
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:04,000
It does have to do with the classic system that I brought up over this year.

758
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Okay, so here it is.

759
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
The first game out on that system.

760
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:12,000
The final Classic Game of 2017, bringing it full circle. What is your pick tonight, Arasaka?

761
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:17,000
It's Asuka 120% Burning Fest.

762
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Which I think is a lot of cutscenes. A lot of long, extended segments. You're going to hear a little talking in the background here.

763
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,000
You can skip up into the fighting part of things.

764
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Okay, if I can find one of the fighting parts here. Let me see.

765
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Maybe ten minutes.

766
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Yeah, I was like, this is a long intro. Oh wait, here's some fighting. Hold on, let me skip ahead to here.

767
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
There we go.

768
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Okay.

769
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:49,000
But I would appreciate if you could turn it down a little bit, because I can't hear myself talk.

770
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Oh, sorry.

771
00:58:51,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Okay. Anyway, Asuka 120% Burning Fest was produced by Fill In Cafe and distributed by Family Soft in Kodansha.

772
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:14,000
It was actually programmed and designed by Imazumi Masatoshi, who also did a little game called Tanser Bandit.

773
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Which, if anyone knows Tanser Bandit, it was reskinned as Tandemonium.

774
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,000
So, we've got a little bit of a Playstation link here.

775
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:30,000
It actually had some pretty good talent behind the design.

776
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Manga artist, Alina Nase did the character designs, and she also did the Samurai Spirits 2 anime designs.

777
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:50,000
And a few other manga and games, so really good artists.

778
00:59:50,000 --> 01:00:00,000
And then the music was done by Youmao Keishi, who did actually a good number of games for Terra Fantavica,

779
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Paradise Lost, Mad Stalker, quite a few games.

780
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:11,000
So, we've got a really talented sound designer.

781
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:17,000
But anyway, the game itself came out on the FM Challenge.

782
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:22,000
So, that's why it went back to one of the classic games.

783
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:28,000
And it was released initially on March 11, 1994.

784
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,000
The series only came out in Japan.

785
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,000
But it had many iterations of the time.

786
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:38,000
I'm not even saying it's all that great of a game, it's an all-female fighting game.

787
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Where it's set at the Ryōran Private School.

788
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Where it's all for young girls from the upper edges of society.

789
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:55,000
And they have a martial arts tournament called the Club Rivalry Budget Contest Mega Fight.

790
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Yeah, I'd sign up for that.

791
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:02,000
But it's an all-digital game.

792
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:08,000
So, there was a version released that had voice acting and dubbing,

793
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,000
which I think that's the version I've linked to the video.

794
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:17,000
It's Asuka 120% Special Burning Fest on PlayStation in 1996.

795
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:22,000
And then it had a couple of other releases later.

796
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:31,000
It was updated and released as Asuka 120% Excellent Burning Fest in 1997.

797
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:36,000
And then Asuka 120% Limited Burning Fest for Sega Saturn.

798
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,000
That's much better graphics and changes to the characters.

799
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:51,000
And then there was finally a 1999 release that was Asuka 120% Final Burning Fest.

800
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:56,000
And then there were other releases on PC.

801
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:02,000
It had Return Burning Fest, and then another Final Burning Fest on PlayStation,

802
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
which was part of the Super Life 1500 series.

803
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:10,000
And Limit Over Burning Fest, that was an unofficial release on Sega Saturn.

804
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
It came out in 1998.

805
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:16,000
But one of the other notable things about this game is that

806
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:24,000
basically, Fill-In Cafe was just two full-time programmers.

807
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,000
And they basically went on to treasure.

808
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:33,000
So, some of the games that they developed,

809
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:37,000
they were also behind Mad Stalker on the X68000,

810
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:48,000
and Makenna Makenna 2, Kimero Yokai Sori for PlayStation before Fill-In Cafe went bankrupt.

811
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,000
So we have our treasure link here as well.

812
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:59,000
But for a game that's only got six characters, it certainly did have quite the following.

813
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:04,000
The website actually is still up and running, the Japanese website.

814
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:12,000
It's Asuka 120% Burning Room, and you can go check out characters and look up stuff on them there.

815
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,000
You know, there's character models and whatnot.

816
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:25,000
But really, this is, I mean, it was kind of one of those niche games that fans either love or hate.

817
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Like I said, it's not the most solid fighting game out there,

818
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:36,000
but it is one of the ones that began its life on the FM Towns,

819
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:41,000
and we got much wider releases later, and they kept updating and updating it.

820
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:45,000
So, there you go, Asuka 120% Burning Fest.

821
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Alright, kind of bringing it full circle with the FM Towns from earlier this year and the classic system and all that.

822
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:57,000
There it is, your classic game of the week, Asuka 120% Burning Fest.

823
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Eleven versions of the game.

824
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Yeah, the noises you were hearing were from the Sega Saturn version of the game, just to clarify,

825
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,000
because I think you said it was the PlayStation in there, but that was the Sega Saturn version,

826
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:11,000
which was probably the one you had, if any of them, I'm assuming.

827
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:15,000
I think I've got it somewhere in the pile.

828
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:22,000
But I mean, it was always that game that whenever I went to import shops, it was always everywhere.

829
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:27,000
I mean, it's about, I'd say, a fairly common game.

830
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,000
You know, at least in my experience it was.

831
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,000
People might have a little bit more trouble finding it now.

832
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:39,000
I mean, if we look on eBay, I'm sure we could find a couple copies for various things.

833
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Alright. Well, Jamie, feel better, and we hope to see you here next week,

834
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
but if it's a couple weeks, then it's a couple weeks.

835
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
But we'll see you soon, I hope.

836
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:56,000
By the way, if you did want it on Saturn, the most expensive one I found is 27 bucks.

837
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Oh, that's not that bad.

838
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Yeah, it's really cheap. However, the game is...

839
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:06,000
There's other games you could spend the money on.

840
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Well, the Sharp X68000 version is 200 bucks, but then again, it is the Sharp X68000.

841
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Yeah, that's gonna be a little harder console to find, so...

842
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Alright. Well, I'm gonna let you go, Jamie. Enjoy the drugs.

843
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Oh, yeah, I've been enjoying them a lot. Thank you.

844
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Alright.

845
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Hopefully it will make me not give a crap about how 2018 starts.

846
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Alright, well take care and feel better.

847
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Thank you. Bye.

848
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Alright, always good to hear from Dark Sakura here on the show.

849
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
We are gonna take a quick break, though, but don't go anywhere.

850
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,000
We've got more Orange Launch Radio to come, including some rapid-fire news.

851
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:47,000
I don't know if we have mail tonight, but we'll log in and find out.

852
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,000
And some other gaming news, and then we'll open the Skype line.

853
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:54,000
I don't know if anyone's gonna call us, but we'll open the Skype line and see if we get anything.

854
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:58,000
And then that'll probably wrap it up here on this special New Year's Eve edition,

855
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
because we didn't want to go two weeks with no show.

856
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
So, you know, because we've done that already too much this year.

857
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
It's been a year.

858
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,000
So, a little special edition of Orange Launch Radio here to close out the year.

859
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:12,000
We'll be right back after this break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

860
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

861
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Live today, December 31st, New Year's Eve, with a special edition of our show

862
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,000
that's taping a little bit earlier in the day here.

863
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Loki is joining me here in studio.

864
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Dark Sakura just was on the phone with us, but is no longer here.

865
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
So, yes, Loki?

866
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:43,000
So, yeah. So, I bribed my son into coming in here to talk to us a little bit.

867
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Okay. Amazing. I don't know how you did that, but congrats.

868
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Power of Slurpees.

869
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
All right. So, can we say hello?

870
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Pick up that mic and say hi to our listeners that are out there, if you don't mind.

871
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
How's it going?

872
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Good.

873
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Good, yeah. You've been playing Super Mario Odyssey in the other room, right?

874
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Yeah.

875
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Do you like that game?

876
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Yes.

877
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Why do you like Super Mario Odyssey? What is it about that game?

878
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Well, so, it's just like you can throw the hat and you can turn into stuff. It's fun to do it.

879
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
When you're like throwing the hat and stuff, it's really cool?

880
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Yeah, you can like throw it on them and then you can like throw it on stuff and then you can like turn into it.

881
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,000
What's your favorite like thing to throw a hat at?

882
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Frog, because you can jump high.

883
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Frogs are pretty cool, but don't bring them in the house.

884
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Yeah.

885
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Yeah.

886
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,000
So, you play a lot of, what was it, Roblox?

887
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Yeah, Roblox.

888
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,000
So, in Roblox, what's your favorite game to play on that one?

889
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Or what is Roblox, first off?

890
01:07:49,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Well, Roblox is like a game where you can like make your own character, but you need to, some stuff like you need to use with Roblox, which you buy with real money.

891
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Oh boy, I bet Dad loves that.

892
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:09,000
And then, and then you use it to like buy stuff in the game.

893
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Like VIP-ers?

894
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Yeah, like VIP.

895
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:16,000
So, I've seen you play like different like simulator games in there, like they have like a prison-

896
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,000
Subway simulator.

897
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Subway simulator, so is that like a subway like the train or a subway like the restaurant?

898
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
A subway to the train.

899
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Oh, okay.

900
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Not the restaurant, because then I would just go in there and buy like a thousand million sandwiches.

901
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:40,000
And then I've seen you do one like, was it like a cake or something? Was it like a cake one where you make cakes or something and then you were killing somebody?

902
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,000
I don't remember how-

903
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
What? I wasn't killing anybody?

904
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,000
No.

905
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,000
With a cake? That seems-

906
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,000
If they have like-

907
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,000
What a delicious death.

908
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:52,000
I don't know, he had like simulators and stuff where he'll go and attack people like for money or something, I don't remember.

909
01:08:53,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Well, there's some stuff where you need to like attack people and then you need to like evolve.

910
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:05,000
And then you play a lot of Wii U stuff, so what are your favorite games to play on Wii U?

911
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Legend of Zelda.

912
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Legend of Zelda.

913
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:12,000
The Breath of the Wild? The new one?

914
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Both.

915
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Both, and you got Wind Waker?

916
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Yeah, I only have those two.

917
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Cool.

918
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:25,000
What's your favorite thing to do in Zelda Breath of the Wild? Do you like to just run around or do you like to ride a horse or what do you like to do?

919
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
I like to throw in the bombs.

920
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Do you like to use the bombs?

921
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Come on, Nolgus wants to ask. Ask him if Loki steals his Legos. Do I steal your Legos?

922
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Do I steal your Legos?

923
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Kind of.

924
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Kind of.

925
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Kind of.

926
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:49,000
If you don't steal his Legos, I suggest he completes his Lego sets in a shorter period of time than three months.

927
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:54,000
I did hear that the presence of Dark Soccer and I got you, he ended up getting to use a lot, so.

928
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Yes, yes. My youngest son Danny got the Lego Batman.

929
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Lego Batman.

930
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:11,000
The Brickhead and then they got the Domino Rally, which we haven't, well we opened up the other day and my youngest son wants to take it out and spread it all over the floor and I'm like, no.

931
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Let's not do that. I think he wanted, he thought that there was like cars in there and he wanted to play with the cars is what he wanted.

932
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,000
Oh.

933
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,000
So we did that.

934
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:28,000
I'm looking at our chat. Tigerclaw on chat says, does Loki, your dad, stay true to his name? Is he a trickster around the house?

935
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,000
What?

936
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Are you a trickster?

937
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Do I trick you a lot?

938
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Does he like to do pranks? Does he trick you?

939
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:42,000
He sometimes tricks me, like that time on the field trip where you said the head's gonna eat you if you get close.

940
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,000
What?

941
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Remember you said the head was gonna eat you when I get close and you're tricking me.

942
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,000
I don't remember that.

943
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,000
It's probably something adults lie about to make kids behave.

944
01:10:54,000 --> 01:11:02,000
You just have to understand, one thing you learn as you're a parent is there's a certain age where kids will believe anything that you tell them and it's fun just to kind of mess with that.

945
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,000
And so.

946
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Okay.

947
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
When I'm an adult, I'm gonna do that.

948
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Yes you will and you'll learn the joy that.

949
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Do you.

950
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:16,000
One more question here from one of our listeners, Bobby Blackwolf, who asks, who completes things they build first? Josh or Loki?

951
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:23,000
He is referring to the fact that I've not finished my game.

952
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Yeah, you've never finished your game.

953
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Yes.

954
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,000
All your games.

955
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Yes, that's correct.

956
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Yeah, drag him.

957
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,000
All right.

958
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Well, technically he hasn't finished most of his Lego sets either, so we're tied.

959
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Only two.

960
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Only two.

961
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:44,000
Well, two that you've started, you still have one that's in a box.

962
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
I can now see the resemblance here.

963
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,000
I'm screaming over here.

964
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:52,000
All right, anything else we need to ask Josh about?

965
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Did you want to plug your YouTube channel?

966
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Wait, Josh has a YouTube channel?

967
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,000
He does have a YouTube channel.

968
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,000
I didn't know that.

969
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:07,000
I don't know if my wife wants a lot of people in the middle, but your YouTube channel, the one that you do with your, what is it, Josh and Danny music and games?

970
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,000
No.

971
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
He doesn't want to plug his YouTube channel.

972
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
All right, but it's a secret for now.

973
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:17,000
Yeah, I said in one year I put one video on.

974
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,000
That's all right.

975
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,000
I put one video on.

976
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,000
That's why I asked your dad how many games he's published in a year.

977
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:26,000
One of these days I'll publish something in a year.

978
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,000
You'll have to be quiet.

979
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
So enjoy it while you can now.

980
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:34,000
No, but there's, uh, no, he plays the piano, so he does that.

981
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:40,000
And, um, the only hardest part of my homework is my piano.

982
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:48,000
And he likes, um, I kind of played the piano when I was about your age, except I played what was called the organ.

983
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,000
I'm seven.

984
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,000
You know an organ?

985
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,000
No.

986
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,000
The organ's like two pianos.

987
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,000
One's on top of the other.

988
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,000
That's what I used to play.

989
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Oh, yeah, I think that is.

990
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:05,000
So, um, so yeah, he plays the piano, so he records some videos of him doing that, but he really looks up to Ryan's toy review.

991
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
It's, it's a video.

992
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Well, there's videos where, basically he does everything.

993
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:19,000
They do like a lot of blogging and toy opening and stuff like that, but he's like one of the most insanely popular kids channels.

994
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:25,000
He's like a multi-millionaire now because, yeah, from opening toys and doing stuff with your family.

995
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,000
I like to open toys.

996
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Exactly!

997
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,000
I like toys.

998
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Why am I not getting millions of dollars, you know?

999
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:34,000
Because you're not playing a YouTube channel of toys.

1000
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Well, we need to do that.

1001
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
We just need to vlog all this stuff we do and open toys.

1002
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:43,000
That's why I made my, uh, my channel for toys.

1003
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,000
Your toys channel?

1004
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,000
So I can be rich.

1005
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:50,000
I can't wait for your kid to make more money off YouTube than you've ever made off this show.

1006
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
It won't take long.

1007
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
It won't take long at all.

1008
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Alright.

1009
01:13:55,000 --> 01:14:00,000
But I'm, uh, I'm not gonna make huge, like, eggs.

1010
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,000
He doesn't want to do the big surprise eggs, I guess.

1011
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Yeah, they have, like, a bunch of toys that we don't get for toys.

1012
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,000
You gotta talk into the microphone, they can't hear you otherwise.

1013
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,000
I know.

1014
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Okay.

1015
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Alright.

1016
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Any final thoughts for the show?

1017
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
You wanna go back to playing Super Mario Odyssey?

1018
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Yes!

1019
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Just say bye.

1020
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Bye, bye!

1021
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Alright.

1022
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Josh, everybody, Loki's child, making his debut on the show.

1023
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Give a round of applause, even though there's really nobody here.

1024
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Good job, Josh.

1025
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Alright.

1026
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,000
There you go.

1027
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,000
They're applauding out there.

1028
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Why don't you take your coat off?

1029
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,000
You're probably hot.

1030
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,000
Alright.

1031
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Alright, fine.

1032
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Go play Super Mario Odyssey.

1033
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
We've got some comments in chat here.

1034
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Does Josh have any last minute stories?

1035
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
Dungeon Buster says, Super Josh Odyssey.

1036
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,000
And Dark Tetsuya says, He's adorable.

1037
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,000
There you go.

1038
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Seal of approval from chat.

1039
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Alright.

1040
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Alright, thanks.

1041
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Buy Josh a Switch.

1042
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Yes, he would probably like it if I got a Switch.

1043
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,000
And honestly, like, you should've heard before the show.

1044
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Josh was like, Let's go after the show and buy one.

1045
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:05,000
I'm like, I can't, Mommy would get mad if I spent the time.

1046
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
Yeah, Mommy would get very mad, I think.

1047
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Have the money on a Switch.

1048
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Alright, let's get into some rapid fire news, Loki.

1049
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Okay, so let's talk a little bit about PlayStation Plus in January.

1050
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Actually getting some decent games.

1051
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Deus Ex Mankind Divided is gonna be the free game as well as Batman the Telltale series.

1052
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,000
That's on PlayStation 4.

1053
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:28,000
PlayStation 3, you're getting Sacred 3 and The Book of Unwritten Tales 2.

1054
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:32,000
And then on the Vita, you're getting a couple cross-buy games as well for PlayStation 4,

1055
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:37,000
which is Psycho-Pass mandatory happiness and Uncanny Valley.

1056
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:42,000
So Psycho-Pass, is that related to the Weird Al Yankovic album as well?

1057
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,000
I wish.

1058
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
You know, that would be pretty cool.

1059
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:49,000
But hey, Deus Ex looks pretty cool, so hope I check those out.

1060
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:53,000
And those are free if you have PlayStation Plus, which you probably do if you have a PlayStation system.

1061
01:15:54,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Alright, and then last but not least, there is a ROM hack out there for Super Mario Land 2,

1062
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:04,000
which adds color, because if you remember, it was a Game Boy game.

1063
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:10,000
And Game Boys were pretty much monochrome green back in the 90s.

1064
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:14,000
And so now this is actually like a Game Boy Color version of the game.

1065
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:17,000
And they even have it where you can dump it to a ROM and you can play it.

1066
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:21,000
And they'll even give you the error if you try to play it on a regular Game Boy,

1067
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:24,000
where it says this is a Game Boy Color game.

1068
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,000
That's kind of neat.

1069
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Yeah, and it looks pretty nice looking, so you can check that out.

1070
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Has anyone tried to reverse dump that onto a cartridge to actually play it on Game Boy Color?

1071
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Yeah, they've done that.

1072
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Oh, cool.

1073
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
You can actually dump that onto a cartridge, yeah.

1074
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Wow.

1075
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Alright.

1076
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Well, moving on to some other stories, let's talk about the upcoming Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection.

1077
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Some fans in Japan.

1078
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:53,000
So it's not just people in the US on Twitter that create sometimes a lot of controversy,

1079
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:59,000
because it's even happening in Japan that they are very upset about some, well not everybody,

1080
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:04,000
but some fans in Japan are upset about some of the decisions made for Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection.

1081
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:08,000
This actually, it does kind of make sense though, like I actually get why they're mad.

1082
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:12,000
If you haven't heard, there's going to be 12 games in this 30th Anniversary edition,

1083
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:17,000
which they announced a few weeks ago, including Street Fighter II, Street Fighter II Turbo,

1084
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:20,000
3rd Strike, Street Fighter Alpha, et cetera, et cetera.

1085
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
But, here's the crazy part.

1086
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Since all titles contents are based on the overseas versions,

1087
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,000
the titles, voicing, and text will be in English.

1088
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:37,000
So, meaning that the Street Fighter Alpha series, which was called Street Fighter Zero in Japan,

1089
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:43,000
they're going to go with the English title names, and so they're basically not changing anything for Japan,

1090
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:50,000
and I think that even means going so far as to, like, that the names of the characters are going to be all messed up,

1091
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:53,000
because you know, over in Japan, what was it?

1092
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:56,000
What we know as Balrog was...

1093
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Vega?

1094
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
No, what we know as Balrog...

1095
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,000
M. Bison?

1096
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:05,000
How was it, yeah. M. Bison was that, and then Vega was the last boss, which we have as M. Bison,

1097
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:10,000
and then the guy that climbs the walls, we have as Vega, but that was Balrog.

1098
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
So it's all messed up, right?

1099
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:16,000
So that is, apparently none of that's getting changed for Japan.

1100
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:19,000
So it's kind of like, you get the 30th Anniversary Collection,

1101
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:24,000
but we hope you enjoy the additions from the Americas, because that's what you're getting.

1102
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:30,000
So, Japanese fans are a little upset they're not taking the time to provide the Japanese versions.

1103
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
So, anyway.

1104
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Dartetsuya, interesting.

1105
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:38,000
That's why Ivo uses universal names for the characters.

1106
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Boxer, Claw, Dictator. Interesting.

1107
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Boxer, Claw, Dictator.

1108
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Yeah, makes sense. Alright.

1109
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:56,000
So anyway, it works both ways around, I suppose, is that sometimes Japanese fans get upset about things not being localized over there either.

1110
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Anyway, my last, or my next rapid-fire story won't load, but I'm going to try to do this from memory.

1111
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:05,000
They are re-releasing, I suppose, Catherine.

1112
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:10,000
You know that game, that was a big, kind of like, it was like a puzzle game, it was a little bit cultish.

1113
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:14,000
They are re-releasing that on the PlayStation 4 as what's called Catherine Full Body,

1114
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:22,000
and I'm hearing it is kind of like a remaster of the first game, but it sounds like there might be some extra content there.

1115
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:27,000
It's kind of like New Game Plus, I suppose. They're going back and adding some new stuff to it.

1116
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Yeah, they're saying that basically this came out of Weekly Famitsu, so they've got, I guess, a profile for the third Catherine,

1117
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:40,000
because if you remember from Catherine, there was two different Catharines that were in there, but now they're adding a third.

1118
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:48,000
And I guess along with that, there's, I don't know, they don't really talk too much about it.

1119
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:55,000
There's some streams that they're doing as well on YouTube and NicoNico, or they did those, I guess those were on the 22nd.

1120
01:19:55,000 --> 01:20:01,000
And yeah, so it looks like it's just kind of an expanded version of the game.

1121
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Yeah, so I kind of missed it the first time around, so maybe I'll get around to checking it out this time, we'll see.

1122
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Yeah, just depends on price and time and all that good stuff, but I know the first game had its fans, so I'm sure some folks are excited to kind of see that come full circle.

1123
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Alright, this is the part of the show where we talk about what's coming out in stores this week, but I think with the holidays, we're really empty,

1124
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:27,000
so we're going to just kind of skip past that this week and get back into some releases next year, right?

1125
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:32,000
Do we have anything in early January? I know I'm kind of asking you a question about something you might not be prepared to answer.

1126
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Why do we know Dissidia is a January title next year, right?

1127
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Yeah, I don't know what they've got coming as far as 2018. They usually get some stuff in January, but it's not normally until the second or third week, usually.

1128
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:50,000
Let's take a quick peek here real fast.

1129
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Sorry to put you on the spot.

1130
01:20:52,000 --> 01:21:03,000
No worries. January, the first release I show is actually on the 11th, so they have The Escapists 2 on the Nintendo Switch, followed by the 16th with Street Fighter V, the arcade edition.

1131
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Oh, right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1132
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:12,000
So, yeah, there's Dissidia. I mean, just kind of going over some of the stuff. There's Dragon Ball FighterZ. Jamie will be very pleased with that.

1133
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Dissidia Final Fantasy NT is going to be coming to the PlayStation 4 by the end of the month.

1134
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:21,000
And looking way ahead, February, they've got Civ VI Rise and Fall.

1135
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Yeah, that's the expansion, yeah. It didn't make our show roll tonight, but they announced there's going to be another leader for India, I guess, in that expansion.

1136
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:48,000
So that it's not always Gandhi that's threatening to nuke you, which goes back to a bug in the classic Civilization game, where basically Gandhi was supposed to be so not like that that I think it subtracted two or something, and then that caused the odometer to roll over, so it actually set him on the ultra-highest setting.

1137
01:21:48,000 --> 01:22:09,000
I'm like really crappily explaining this, but basically we'll say a math bug caused him to be the most extreme when it came to declaring war and bombing people, which obviously is not what Gandhi was, but it just kind of makes for a funny Civilization game, I suppose. It is just a video game, after all.

1138
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Yeah, Monster Hunter World, and then looking into February, they've got, what else have we got here? Looks like Metal Gear Survive.

1139
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Oh god, I forgot all about that.

1140
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,000
The Bananas Switch releases.

1141
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Yeah, I'm excited about that, so that'll be cool.

1142
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,000
There's lots of stuff coming.

1143
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Well, this is a good chance for you guys to catch up on gaming backlogs, and if you're like me, I'm sure you have a ton of them.

1144
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Alright, we would usually do emails here as well, but our email bag's looking a little empty, so send us something for next year, would ya?

1145
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Participate at orangelauntrader.com if you'd like to say hello, comment on any news story that we've been talking about.

1146
01:22:46,000 --> 01:23:02,000
We get some really good insights sometimes from people that are like, hey, I work at XYZ Place, or hey, this game you guys didn't know much about, I played a lot of this game, so we always appreciate those insights, because there's only so many hours in a day, and we do all hold down day jobs too, so sometimes we can't get around to literally everything.

1147
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:07,000
Anyway, we will pick back up then with some other news. Loki.

1148
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:19,000
As I've been hinting throughout the show, Nintendo, their paid online service, which still hasn't released and has been delayed and delayed and delayed is now being delayed again.

1149
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:23,000
So now they're saying that it's been pushed back to fall of 2018.

1150
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Wow.

1151
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:36,000
I mean, I don't know what this is, what is the holdup? Like really, what is the holdup at this point? It's like 19 months after the...

1152
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:46,000
I would literally have to invent things, because we have no idea what it is, what they're working on, I can only think maybe performance issues, but I mean, that's not really being fair to anybody, it's just a guess.

1153
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:54,000
I mean, I hate making fun of Nintendo for being totally green and online, but...

1154
01:23:54,000 --> 01:24:06,000
Well, here's the plus, there is a plus to this, you don't have to pay to play Splatoon online for another year potentially, so wasn't there something too about that this may only be impacting certain countries?

1155
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Because Nintendo hasn't officially said anything yet, right?

1156
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:16,000
They haven't said anything, it originally was delayed this spring 2018, but they haven't really said too much about it.

1157
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:28,000
They're saying that apparently, this is according to Nintendo, the Italian Nintendo website, so Nintendo Italy is showing that it's been delayed to fall of 2018, so the assumption is well, it's a worldwide launch.

1158
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:31,000
And we know it may not necessarily be worldwide.

1159
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:38,000
I kinda don't understand why they'd hold it back in certain places only, especially a place like Italy, what did they do, you know?

1160
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:45,000
Like, what's special in an online capacity regard, what is special about Italy compared to say, the rest of Europe, you know?

1161
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Well, I don't know, so we don't know yet because they're quiet about it, so don't be surprised.

1162
01:24:52,000 --> 01:25:03,000
Again, rumor, capital rumor, is that there's supposed to be a Nintendo Direct in early January, which would make sense because they're gonna start to detail some of the gaming releases.

1163
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:10,000
We know we have Bayonetta coming, but they're gonna really want to lay out, here's what to get hyped about in January, February, March, April, May, so it would make sense that they would do a Direct.

1164
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:21,000
And if they don't address it in the Direct, I think it's safe to say it's delayed, because if it was supposed to be debuting in early 2018, we would kinda hear something in this Direct, I would think.

1165
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,000
So...

1166
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:37,000
Yeah, I'm just surprised. I mean, I don't know. I would've thought, it seems like if it's coming out like 19 months after a console's been released, that's like pretty poor planning. Like, you couldn't... I don't know.

1167
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:42,000
I'm trying to think, though, haven't? I mean, it's not like, well, yeah, I mean, it's online.

1168
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,000
This isn't...

1169
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Yeah, it's not like a redesign of the dashboard or...

1170
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:53,000
But this isn't like the first time they delayed. So I remember with the original Wii web browser and stuff, that was delayed as well after launch, and then you had to pay for it.

1171
01:25:53,000 --> 01:26:00,000
And I don't know, back in that time period, jeez. But like, I'm just surprised.

1172
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:08,000
Okay, I knew there had to be some of this. Bobby Blackwolf points out Xbox Live didn't come out on the original Xbox for two years.

1173
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,000
But maybe...

1174
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:12,000
But did they ever plan to have that at launch? Or was that like a...

1175
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:19,000
Well, and I also kind of strike it up to one of those things where it's like, well, you don't know what you're missing until you have it.

1176
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:22,000
And that was the first. Xbox Live was kind of the first, right?

1177
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:28,000
And so now, you know, at that point, those first two years of Xbox Live, you didn't know what you were missing until you had it.

1178
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:34,000
And now that's kind of where we're at with Nintendo. But it's not like you can play Splatoon Online.

1179
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:41,000
You do have that phone app, which, you know, it's not... I think everybody's kind of worked around with the voice chat.

1180
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:47,000
But it does provide that enhanced breakdown of your stats in Splatoon 2 and being able to see what's in the stores.

1181
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:51,000
I mean, it's a little something that wasn't there before. So it's not like there isn't anything at all.

1182
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:58,000
I think the big question mark is, what the heck is going on with Virtual Console and Online and that whole thing?

1183
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:02,000
I think that's more of it. It's not like online play doesn't work. Look at Splatoon 2.

1184
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:06,000
And I know I keep going back to that one. That's the first thing that comes to my mind. Mario Kart is also online.

1185
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:09,000
You know, there are Nintendo games that perform online right now.

1186
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:17,000
It's just, we don't know what the extra stuff, which is namely, I guess, Virtual Console, we don't know what any of that's going to be.

1187
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:23,000
But then here's the other weird thing about Virtual Console and all that. I don't know if you know this, but over this holiday break,

1188
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:31,000
I think it was just either like on Christmas Day or the day before, that versus Super Mario Brothers came out for Arcade Archives.

1189
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:39,000
So you can play kinda the original Super Mario Brothers on Nintendo Switch now. Kinda.

1190
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:45,000
But of course, that versus Super Mario Brothers, it was different. It was a little bit harder. There's some missing things.

1191
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:50,000
And then even when you get into it, like the warp zones don't all work. You can only go to level six.

1192
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:58,000
And then when you get that far in the game, like levels are straight up replaced with levels that are in Super Mario Brothers 2 Japan,

1193
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:02,000
which is lost levels here, which as you remember, those levels were very hard.

1194
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:09,000
So anyway, so it's kind of like a mishmash of all these different elements of, I guess, the first two Mario Brothers games overseas.

1195
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:16,000
But anyway, the point is you can play Super Mario Brothers on the Switch kinda right now.

1196
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:21,000
So, but it won't be the same thing you guys remember. Anyway.

1197
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:27,000
All right. But Bobby does want to clarify the Ethernet port was there at launch.

1198
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:33,000
But was that intended for LAN? Because here's the thing is I remember that the Halo, the original Halo game was all like a...

1199
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:36,000
Was the original Halo LAN? I thought it was.

1200
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,000
Yeah, it's the same link, yeah.

1201
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
Or was it Halo 2? Yeah, I think it was the original Halo.

1202
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:43,000
Because I remember, I'm trying to remember when I first got into Xbox.

1203
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:46,000
Remember, I've told this story before, I played it at a wedding.

1204
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:51,000
And the wedding reception they had, yes they did, they had Halo. Was it Halo or Halo 2?

1205
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:52,000
They had it, but it was a local area network.

1206
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,000
I think they both did.

1207
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
Yeah. And that was when I got hooked on Halo.

1208
01:28:55,000 --> 01:29:00,000
And I was like, I did not think I would enjoy a first person shooter, but this is so much fun. So.

1209
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:05,000
Anyway. And Bobby's clarified, yes, Halo 1 had LAN.

1210
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:08,000
I don't know, it's so long ago, I barely remember.

1211
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,000
It's been over 10 years.

1212
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:12,000
It has been a bit closer to 15 at this point.

1213
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
I know, totally classic game material.

1214
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:21,000
The original Xbox was before this show. I remember buying an Xbox the first or second year of the show.

1215
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Because I finally got swayed by UltraMix. Remember we had that guy, he brought his Xbox to the show.

1216
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:30,000
What was his name, Ryan? Zero? Something like that was his name. Remember that guy?

1217
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,000
Yeah, maybe.

1218
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:35,000
And he came and he brought his Xbox. And I was like, UltraMix is actually kind of rad.

1219
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:38,000
And then when UltraMix 2 happened, I had to have an Xbox.

1220
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:44,000
Because that was the best DDR game. And I still say to this day, the best home DDR game they ever did was UltraMix 2.

1221
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
Was that where they had the different drum stuff?

1222
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:51,000
Yeah, that was when they started licensing the synth pop and it really started to go a different direction.

1223
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
And then they killed it.

1224
01:29:53,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Yeah, unfortunately. Anyway. Let's move on. Did you want to talk about the chips too, while we're here?

1225
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Yeah, we can talk about the chips. So, they're also delaying the 64 gigabit or gigabyte chips. I'm assuming it's gigabyte chips.

1226
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:17,000
So, I guess originally they were supposed to be in the hands of developers already.

1227
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:21,000
But apparently now it's going to be coming out in 2019.

1228
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:30,000
And I guess one thing with that, from what I hear, is that a lot of people aren't using the 32 gigabyte ones that are already available.

1229
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:37,000
And so, right now a way developers have been kind of getting around it is just having a large download after the fact.

1230
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:41,000
Yeah, is this just a cost thing? This might be a stupid question.

1231
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:47,000
But I'm just assuming that a 32 gig cart costs more than a 16 or an 8 gig cart.

1232
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:54,000
And so, to make more money, they are using the smaller carts and doing the download.

1233
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:58,000
Yeah. Because it's your data that you can use.

1234
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:03,000
That's right. That's your 900 gigabytes that the Xbox is downloading in a month.

1235
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:07,000
Yeah. I don't know.

1236
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:15,000
Moving on. Let's talk about, again, these are rumors, but it's a slower show this week, so I'm allowing a few more rumors than usual.

1237
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:21,000
But it's a game that people get excited about. It's Pokemon and the upcoming Gen 8 game, which we know is for Switch.

1238
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:25,000
That part we know. Nintendo's confirmed that the next generation of Pokemon will be on Switch.

1239
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:29,000
And we kind of know that Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon were kind of the last on the 3DS.

1240
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:33,000
And could the game be going through some changes when it comes to the Switch?

1241
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:37,000
Well, there's some information kind of leaking out there on the web.

1242
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:40,000
And, you know, again, take it with a grain of salt.

1243
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:46,000
But the Chinese localization team has apparently already finished translating the game script.

1244
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:49,000
There's not going to be any new mega evolutions introduced in the games.

1245
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:54,000
There will be Z-moves, and they use motion control to activate using the Joy-Cons.

1246
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:58,000
Now, all of this sounds like, okay, yeah, this could all be real.

1247
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:02,000
The central plot revolves around the conflict between tradition and innovation.

1248
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:07,000
Okay, sure. Region inspiration been rumored to be Spain or Italy.

1249
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:12,000
Which, okay, yeah, I mean, X and Y was kind of France inspired, if I remember right.

1250
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
And Sun and Moon was definitely Hawaii.

1251
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:18,000
And every Pokemon game has been inspired by a certain region.

1252
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Which region did they say it was again?

1253
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Spain or Italy.

1254
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:28,000
Poor Italy. You know, getting a region in Pokemon, but not getting there, you know, online for the Switch.

1255
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
Yeah.

1256
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Also, though, the biggest, probably, like, big piece that would be a huge change to the whole thing

1257
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:39,000
is that apparently the battle system is getting simplified.

1258
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:42,000
That could be controversial, and that's the part where I kind of go,

1259
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:45,000
I don't know. I don't know if everybody would be down for that.

1260
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:52,000
But it's going to be, I guess, similar to Digimon World, which seems like sacrilege, but whatever.

1261
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:59,000
And Pokken Tournament with more of a rock, scissors, paper type of attack, block, or grab.

1262
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:03,000
I don't, see, and I don't know if I'm, that doesn't really make sense to me.

1263
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:09,000
Because the typing is so important and is kind of the whole, like, rock, paper, scissors thing, right?

1264
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Like, water beats fire, grass beats water, fire beats grass, right?

1265
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
Like, that's your rock, paper, scissors stuff.

1266
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,000
Yeah.

1267
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:23,000
So, I don't really understand why, and I get, I know that there is this whole system in Pokken and everything as well,

1268
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:27,000
but, like, Pokken is also, like, a fast-paced type of game.

1269
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:32,000
There's a lot going on, like, right now, and so it kind of had to have a different system,

1270
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:37,000
but with the more traditional Pokemon games, they're more of, like, a role-playing game.

1271
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:40,000
So, I don't know, I don't know if this makes as much sense.

1272
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:43,000
I mean, I guess we'll see, but...

1273
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Yeah.

1274
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:48,000
I'm excited for Pokemon Gen 8, though. I really am excited to see it on the Switch,

1275
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:53,000
and the fact that I can pick it up and take it with me and play it on the TV is going to be great.

1276
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Like, I really wish I could have done that for some of the 3DS games.

1277
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
I probably would have been more into it if that was the case.

1278
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:02,000
So, go into our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

1279
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:05,000
Act-F says, that works in Pokken.

1280
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
It's dumb to apply it to the regular games.

1281
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:10,000
Pokken is a fighting game. It needs the triangle system.

1282
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:14,000
Pokemon has way more going for it to have way oversimplified.

1283
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Well, yeah, and in Pokken, you can't really, I don't think it does anyway.

1284
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:21,000
Correct me if I'm wrong, Act-F, but I don't think it does the whole

1285
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:24,000
water beats fire beats, you know, that whole thing,

1286
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:28,000
because it's a fighting game and you need the characters to be a little more equal.

1287
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:32,000
Like, you don't want one character to be stronger than another just because of the typing.

1288
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:35,000
In Pokken, it's different, so that's why they have this kind of different system.

1289
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
So, anyway.

1290
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
That's what I thought. Thank you, Act-F.

1291
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
Act-F agrees with me.

1292
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:44,000
Alright, anyhow, let's move on. I know rumors are not the most fun stories,

1293
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
but it's a slower time to hear.

1294
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:47,000
Let's talk more rumors!

1295
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:48,000
Uh-oh.

1296
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
But this one has a little more substance to it, right?

1297
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:54,000
Possibly. Hopefully it's not a faked screenshot, but apparently, allegedly,

1298
01:34:54,000 --> 01:35:00,000
there was a PlayStation Network page that went live for Destiny 2's second expansion,

1299
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:07,000
titled Gods of Mars, and it was also leaked onto Reddit with a few screenshots.

1300
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:11,000
They said that basically it talks about that the Guardian will be exploring

1301
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:16,000
the frigid Vale of Mars, and will go up against, I guess,

1302
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:22,000
Charlemagne, who imprisoned Rasputin after reawaking Mars,

1303
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:27,000
and they are supposed to be freeing Rasputin and defeating Charlemagne.

1304
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:34,000
And they've got new story missions, new themed weapons armors, co-op,

1305
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:38,000
co-op multiplayer arenas, new enemy factions and bosses,

1306
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:41,000
and, of course, now it's supposed to be 20 bucks.

1307
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Coming out March 2018.

1308
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
And I fell off that Destiny train so fast.

1309
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Like, I was really into it for like a week, and then I got distracted.

1310
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
And I think what hasn't helped is then they're like,

1311
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
oh, this expansion came out and you've got to buy this expansion now

1312
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:57,000
to kind of really see what else is in the game.

1313
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:00,000
And it's like, I barely, I think because I waited for the PC release,

1314
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:03,000
I kind of screwed a lot of that up because the time between the PC release

1315
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:07,000
and expansion was a lot less than, say, somebody who got it on PlayStation 4

1316
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
or Xbox One in the expansion.

1317
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:13,000
So it was like, where did the time go with the first game?

1318
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Oh, well.

1319
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:17,000
Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Dungeon Buster says,

1320
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:21,000
people are pretty upset with Destiny 2 right now, especially with the expansion.

1321
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:25,000
Yeah, I've heard that they've actually had to go in and do another patch for the game

1322
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:29,000
because I guess, you know, end game content was getting pretty hosed by this expansion

1323
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:32,000
and some of the people who hadn't bought it were getting really irritated.

1324
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:35,000
Well, yeah, they had it. It was content that was available already

1325
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:39,000
and then they paywalled it, like, after it's been available for a while

1326
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:45,000
behind the expansion because it was end game stuff, which was just like, what the hell?

1327
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:48,000
And then they were messing with the XP gains.

1328
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:53,000
At least you can still play stuff like World of Warcraft if you don't have the expansions.

1329
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:58,000
You might have a lot harder of a time finding a party for the content you want to do,

1330
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:01,000
but, you know, you can do it.

1331
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:06,000
I don't know. There's just been a whole lot of Destiny 2 backlash

1332
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:10,000
and the whole, you know, Eververse thing is just not helping.

1333
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:13,000
Funny you bring that up because Dungeon Buster actually says in chat,

1334
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:18,000
if you go to the official forums, there are pages of nothing but remove Eververse

1335
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:21,000
because of the way they did the loot tables in the game, especially with the Cyrus.

1336
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
Right, yeah, did you hear about their Christmas event that they did?

1337
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:24,000
No, I didn't.

1338
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:27,000
So they had a holiday event and, you know, whereas most holiday events in games,

1339
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:31,000
you know, you go in there, they have Christmas themed loot boxes and all that stuff.

1340
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
Yeah, Heroes of the Storm is doing that right now.

1341
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:34,000
Yeah, so they made it impossible.

1342
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:35,000
I got a snowflake mount last night.

1343
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:39,000
Nice. So they made it so that it was impossible to get all of the, you know,

1344
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:42,000
basically to unlock most of the stuff in those loot boxes.

1345
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:48,000
They paywalled the stuff that they were giving out as part of the Christmas thing behind stuff.

1346
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:52,000
So instead of giving out these things and having, you know, stuff that you could get,

1347
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:55,000
you know, maybe incorporating that into the normal loot boxes.

1348
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:59,000
Like, you know, with Overwatch, you get, you know, holiday stuff themed within that.

1349
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:06,000
Well, in this, it was separate. You have to have certain engrams to unlock those holiday loot boxes.

1350
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:14,000
It's just, it's so greedy. This is just a perfect example.

1351
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:17,000
I think it's going to come back to bite them all. I think it is. Anyway.

1352
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:21,000
All right. Well, hopefully this game won't have any special boxes or DLC.

1353
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:24,000
And again, we don't know what it's going to be.

1354
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:30,000
There is a teaser site that has come up for a new Space Invaders project in 2018,

1355
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:35,000
which of course, what, like only like the biggest arcade game ever in Japan, right?

1356
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:39,000
And certainly everybody here knows Space Invaders as well. It was hugely popular over here.

1357
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:44,000
But I think what's more, I mean, okay, Space Invaders is kind of an older game at this point.

1358
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:47,000
I'm not sure a lot of people get really into like the old, old Space Invaders,

1359
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:52,000
but this game has been reinvented several times in pretty cool ways.

1360
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:56,000
Like Groove Coaster is kind of Space Invaders-y in a way.

1361
01:38:56,000 --> 01:39:01,000
Like they use a lot of the same like art, but especially like I think of Space Invaders Extreme,

1362
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
the one that was kind of like, it was on PSP, I think.

1363
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:04,000
Yeah.

1364
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:07,000
I think they did a version on Xbox Arcade and some of that.

1365
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:08,000
Yeah.

1366
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:11,000
But like with the techno music and stuff as you play, it was a really cool game.

1367
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
Like it was a really neat reinvention.

1368
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:17,000
And then what they had Arknoid versus Space Invaders not that long ago, and that was kind of fun too.

1369
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:20,000
So like they've been reinventing Space Invaders in some really cool ways.

1370
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
Oh, and the thing at the arcade.

1371
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:26,000
That's something I played during the break that I haven't talked about on the show yet.

1372
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:31,000
Randomly, Shane and I went over to, you know, the place up in Rockland that has all the music games.

1373
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
So we went up there, it's like a place in Neon FM.

1374
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:37,000
And they have one of those giant, now it's Space Invaders, but it spits out tickets.

1375
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:40,000
But this thing is so colorful and bright and loud, right?

1376
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:41,000
Have you seen these things?

1377
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:42,000
No, I haven't.

1378
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,000
I'm surprised they didn't have one at Golf Land.

1379
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
They may have, but I didn't walk around too much.

1380
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:48,000
I literally went through, we just went upstairs and like didn't look at most of the games.

1381
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:52,000
I did see there was a Max 2 still there that it's sad.

1382
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:59,000
Well, anyway, this mystery project is between Taito, who owns Space Invaders, and Dekika Games.

1383
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:00,000
I hope I said that right.

1384
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:04,000
And they say, if you've ever played a video game, then you likely have Taito to thank.

1385
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
It's been four, that's a little.

1386
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:11,000
But anyway, it's been 40 years since they've released their monumentally influential arcade title,

1387
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:14,000
Space Invaders, an indisputable founding father of modern gaming.

1388
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:20,000
To celebrate this occasion, Taito and Dekika are bringing the invasion to Steam in 2018.

1389
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:23,000
Stay tuned for more details at the beginning of the new year.

1390
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:24,000
They're so humble about it.

1391
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
I know, right? They're so humble.

1392
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:29,000
Maybe that's why they're going to Steam and not the Humble Bundle.

1393
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:32,000
Anyway, I'm sure they'll sell it there too.

1394
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
But yeah, so it'll be interesting to see what this is.

1395
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:35,000
Yeah.

1396
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:40,000
Yeah, probably going to be something that kind of just modernizes the shooter, kind of like Extreme.

1397
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
But I hope the soundtrack is cool.

1398
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:47,000
Yeah, actdeftinchat says, Space Invaders Extreme 3, please.

1399
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:54,000
Tigerclaw says, the game I'm thinking of, Space Invaders Frenzy from Raw Thrills.

1400
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:58,000
Who, Raw Thrills has been doing a lot of those reinvention games.

1401
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
Aren't they the ones that are doing that Ninja Turtles arcade game too?

1402
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:01,000
Yes.

1403
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:02,000
Yeah, that whole thing. So they're doing a lot.

1404
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
There it is. Yeah, this is it.

1405
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:07,000
You have to see where you sit down, you have like the thing you point, it's crazy.

1406
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:10,000
I bet you maybe this is something like they're going to try to make on Steam.

1407
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
I don't know, something that's maybe a little more like...

1408
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
So you actually like shoot stuff?

1409
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
Yeah, you actually shoot them with like a gun.

1410
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:17,000
Huh.

1411
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:18,000
It's different, right?

1412
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:23,000
That's the cool thing about these Space Invaders reimaginings is that many of them don't really stick to the old format.

1413
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
So, anyway.

1414
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:26,000
Cool.

1415
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:29,000
Cool. Anyway, that's what I have to say about Space Invaders. Loki.

1416
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:32,000
Alright, and then unfortunately some more bad news.

1417
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:47,000
The voice actor, Jim French, has passed away. He was better known for some of the games he did voice work for for Valve, including Left 4 Dead, Left 4 Dead 2, and even Half-Life 2.

1418
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:51,000
So, he did play Bill, I guess, in the Left 4 Dead series.

1419
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:56,000
And in Half-Life 2, he played Father Grigori.

1420
01:41:56,000 --> 01:42:03,000
And I guess he also does the voice of Elder Titan in Dota 2, and the fisherman in Half-Life 2, Lost Coast.

1421
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:11,000
And aside from that, he was also, you know, I guess a radio producer and a host for several years.

1422
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:20,000
He created a show called Imagination Theater, I guess in Seattle's KIRO station, and later in KIXI.

1423
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
So, he was 89 years old.

1424
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:28,000
Well, that's a good age, but very sad to hear about that.

1425
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:36,000
Lastly, tonight, end 2017. I thought maybe a little bit of music game news would be fun here.

1426
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:37,000
Yes.

1427
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:42,000
I don't know if there's anybody out there who wants to call in, but just in case we have anybody again on this early day.

1428
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:50,000
If you do happen to be listening later in the evening at our usual time, you're hearing a rebroadcast because we did tape the show today at noon.

1429
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:54,000
It's almost 2 o'clock on the West Coast now to free up our evenings.

1430
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:57,000
But if you are listening live at the earlier time, you can give us a call.

1431
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:00,000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

1432
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
And you can say hello.

1433
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
Otherwise, we'll probably be wrapping up soon.

1434
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
But I did want to end it here on this note.

1435
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:09,000
It's just kind of music game news, but a little iffy.

1436
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:23,000
That is that MAME, the Multi Arcade Machine Emulator, controversial emulator, I'm sure, but it is worth reporting that MAME, the new version of MAME, will be supporting Beatmania.

1437
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:27,000
Certain versions, 2DX specifically. I think the five keys are already supported.

1438
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:28,000
Yeah.

1439
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:40,000
But it will now support Beatmania 2DX 4th style, 6th style, 7th style, 8th style, Substream, and that's the one with DDR 2nd club.

1440
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:47,000
Some other games worth mentioning, King of Fighters 98, Knights of Valor 2, New Legend, San Francisco Rush.

1441
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:48,000
Rock sweet.

1442
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
Wow, I'm almost more excited about that.

1443
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:51,000
Yeah, exactly.

1444
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
That game was awesome.

1445
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:54,000
So there you go.

1446
01:43:54,000 --> 01:44:02,000
So that's kind of neat. Again, a little bit controversial because those games still kind of exist in many arcades, but those are some older versions.

1447
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:12,000
And something to also think about, because it is an emulator, it's going to be a little slower, so your timing is going to really stink.

1448
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:16,000
And working doesn't necessarily mean working greater.

1449
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:29,000
What kind of specs do you need to run that kind of stuff? Because I remember trying to get Gauntlet Legends to work, you have to have a 4GHz processor or something ridiculous.

1450
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:37,000
I used to do a lot more MAME than I do now, and usually they'd get released, but then they'd get optimized. It would take a little time, but they'd get faster.

1451
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:44,000
And also, I've been doing MAME prior to them supporting multi-processors as well, so it may be a lot better now, who knows.

1452
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:52,000
DarkTetsuya said, I played 2DX6 on it, it's still early, so there's some issues, but it still kind of works, but I figured you guys might appreciate this.

1453
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:58,000
No, of course, it's a good note, but I'm bummed for us to end on here in 2017.

1454
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:02,000
Alright, I'm going to do another shoutout for calls and see if we get anything.

1455
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:07,000
OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype if anyone wants to get out their final thoughts for 2017.

1456
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
So games we're anticipating playing in 2018?

1457
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
The Bayonetta remakes.

1458
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:18,000
I want to play Dance Rush whenever that gets brought out here, because I know they're doing location testing still.

1459
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:23,000
But if it ever comes out here, which, that stuff tends to make its way to Dave and Busters.

1460
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:30,000
I feel like next year might be the year for Kingdom Hearts III, finally. Fingers and toes crossed.

1461
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
What do you think about Final Fantasy VII?

1462
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:38,000
I think one or the other's got to happen next year. Maybe next year will be the Final Fantasy VII remake, and then next...

1463
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:41,000
But the Final Fantasy VII remake's supposed to be episodic, too.

1464
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
So I guess the first episode of that.

1465
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
Yeah, maybe they'll both hit next year.

1466
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:48,000
I wonder if Metroid's going to be the fourth quarter game.

1467
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:51,000
I think Metroid will probably be next year. I don't think they want to announce it.

1468
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:52,000
Smash Brothers, maybe?

1469
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:53,000
Maybe.

1470
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:59,000
Smash Brothers, I could see, is a game that they could wait to launch that online service for, because then it's like, you need to have this.

1471
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:06,000
That could be, yeah. They'll probably put out a very powerful kind of game to go with that online service, that's for sure.

1472
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:09,000
Supposed to. By then, it's probably not going to be all that hot.

1473
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:14,000
DungeonBuster in chat says, Bayonetta 2 is definitely on the list for me. Never got to play it.

1474
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:21,000
BobbyBlackWolf says, Final Fantasy VII Remake Episode 1 in December 2018. You don't think they'll aim for November?

1475
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
Try to get the jump on...

1476
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:30,000
I mean, I guess that stuff isn't as important as it used to be, but I would still think you'd try to get it out in November to get the jump on the holidays.

1477
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
But it's not like...

1478
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
Is Crackdown going to come out finally?

1479
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:37,000
I think so, yeah. Crackdown is a game to look forward to next year.

1480
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
Well, it's supposed to come out this year, too.

1481
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:42,000
Yeah. I always forget about the Microsoft stuff. I know that's horrible.

1482
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
But that's because they don't have anything.

1483
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:45,000
Like, they used to have, like...

1484
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
Sea Thieves looked interesting.

1485
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
Oh, come on. No.

1486
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:50,000
Wow.

1487
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:53,000
No, no, they used to have, like, really big, like, releases.

1488
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
Forza Horizon 4.

1489
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:56,000
And now...

1490
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:57,000
Hey, we gotta call. We gotta call. Let's get to it.

1491
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
Hi, you're on Orange Taunt's radio. Who's this?

1492
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:00,000
Hey, this, Act F.

1493
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
Hey, Act F. What's on your mind, buddy?

1494
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:08,000
Well, first of all, I really like that you enjoyed the gift I sent you.

1495
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:11,000
We did. In fact, they're pretty much almost all gone at this point.

1496
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:16,000
But we went all over. Like, I think Alan took a box to, like, a gallery meeting.

1497
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
I don't know if Farzer's still at the house.

1498
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
I know my wife was hoarding them, so...

1499
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:21,000
What, did she like them?

1500
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
I don't know if she's eaten them yet.

1501
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:26,000
Yeah, the hazelnut stuff's really good. I'm sure Jamie ate all hers, too.

1502
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
So, yeah, they're good stuff.

1503
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:31,000
So, thank you for sending enough that we could all kind of share.

1504
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:32,000
Hey, no problem.

1505
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
Well, what's on your mind tonight?

1506
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:47,000
Yeah, anyways, there's a bit of news in Mexico concerning video games, and it's not that great.

1507
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:48,000
Uh-oh.

1508
01:47:49,000 --> 01:48:02,000
Basically, Mexico legislation just passed a law that has to regulate violent games.

1509
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:03,000
Oh.

1510
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:12,000
Yeah. And it's weird, because I'm not against it, because, well, yeah, we do have to regulate those things,

1511
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:18,000
because you cannot sell, like, an M-rated game to a child and all that stuff.

1512
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:22,000
We don't have, like, some... We use the ESRB, obviously.

1513
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:23,000
Right.

1514
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:26,000
But there's nothing that regulates it, so...

1515
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:32,000
So, when we talk about regulating violent games, is it kind of like that law that the Supreme Court kind of flipped here?

1516
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:39,000
In the U.S., the one that never really took place, where, like, a store can't even sell it without checking ID?

1517
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:42,000
Or what do we mean when we say, like, regulating violent games?

1518
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
Yeah, that's basically it.

1519
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:52,000
You'll be ID'd if you want to buy an M-rated game, or a violent game.

1520
01:48:52,000 --> 01:49:08,000
And that's the thing. The legislation says they're gonna make, like, a new rating system, which is, like, really stupid,

1521
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:11,000
because we already use the ESRB.

1522
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:16,000
The ESRB, it's even in Spanish, so it's like, oh, I cannot read English.

1523
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:28,000
No, it's in Spanish, too, so it's, like, really dumb that we're gonna use another, or have another, like, rating system, since it already exists, and we can use that.

1524
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:34,000
Yeah. What do you know? Do you know the why? Like, why is this all happening?

1525
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:47,000
Basically, the reasoning they have, it's because, oh, there's way, the people playing video games right now, it has tripled in amount,

1526
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:58,000
and the majority of people are between the ages of 12 and 18, supposedly, and which I really, really don't believe it,

1527
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:11,000
because consoles here are so way, way too expensive for, like, a 14-year-old to get, so I really don't believe the numbers.

1528
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:20,000
I do understand the reasoning. Again, I'm not really against it, but it's, like, really dumb. They didn't think it through.

1529
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:24,000
Well, for those that agree with you that it's dumb, is there anything at this point that can be done about it?

1530
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:34,000
You know, I know here in the US, again, not to get too political or what have you, but I don't think it's any secret that, like, this year has been really hard on a lot of people,

1531
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:41,000
because, you know, they may not agree with everything that's going on within the government, and it's caused a lot more people to get involved with politics,

1532
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:48,000
and involved in that whole process. Do you think, I mean, is there an option for people in Mexico? Is there a way to get involved?

1533
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:55,000
Is there a Supreme Court type of thing? I really, you know, I don't know. What could be done at this point, Akdev?

1534
01:50:55,000 --> 01:51:10,000
Well, it passed the House of Representatives, the equivalent of it, so it has to go through the Senate, and they can overturn it, or they can just say no, it cannot pass,

1535
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:20,000
but at this point, I think it's gonna pass, even if people, like, start saying, oh, we don't want this, or can you modify it?

1536
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:31,000
It's gonna be like, oh, it's gonna be there, and you cannot do anything about it. Mexican politics are, if you think the US politics are really, really...

1537
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:40,000
I've heard, I've heard, yes. I've heard. Although, I do always get a kick out of what's-his-name, Vicente Fox, and his ramblings on Trump.

1538
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:50,000
That's always a lot of fun, anyway. But, not to get too political. Well, Akdev, I'm sorry to hear that, you know, it may not be going so well, although there might be elements of that that you agree with,

1539
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:58,000
but again, I would, even if it feels like there is no hope, I would encourage people to try to get involved with the political process. At least let the Senators know you disagree.

1540
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:03,000
We do have elections, presidential elections this coming year, so yeah.

1541
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:08,000
There you go, there's your way to have a say. Alright, my friend, well thank you for the update, I appreciate it, keep us posted, alright?

1542
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:21,000
I especially want to know, like, ultimately what the impact is that it has on, like, going to actually buy a game, or if it kind of turns out that you, you know, decide maybe to get stuff from America and bring it in. Who knows? Who knows?

1543
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:27,000
Yeah, most probably what I'm thinking is gonna happen, more people are gonna go digital here.

1544
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:32,000
Ahh. Because, yeah, you cannot wriggle your debt. That's pretty much, like,

1545
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:38,000
Very good point. Yeah, that's a way easy workaround on that, and that's got your games digitally, so,

1546
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:44,000
That's a very good point, just go digital. Alright, Akdev, thank you so much for your support, and have a happy new year, okay?

1547
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
Hey, you too. Alright, thanks buddy.

1548
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:47,000
Thanks.

1549
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:56,000
Alright, I don't think we have any other calls coming in, so I'm gonna go ahead and close up the Skype line there, but if you do have a thought you want to get out, you can always email us.

1550
01:52:56,000 --> 01:53:03,000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, and I think, do you have any last minute stories? I didn't ask.

1551
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:04,000
No.

1552
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:11,000
I figured as much. I figured it's probably time we wrap it up. I think, Josh is probably all done with Odyssey now. Did you get all the moons?

1553
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:12,000
No.

1554
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:13,000
No, okay.

1555
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
I was just going through random.

1556
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:18,000
He was just going through random. Don't forget to talk in the mic or the people can't hear you.

1557
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:21,000
I was going through random.

1558
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:22,000
Did you turn the mic off?

1559
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:23,000
It's on, we can hear him.

1560
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:24,000
Okay.

1561
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:25,000
Go ahead, you were going through random.

1562
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:29,000
I was going through random kingdoms.

1563
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:35,000
Just random kingdoms. That's what I do too. I just, you know, what do I feel like doing today? That's a good way to do it.

1564
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:41,000
Well, Josh, thank you for being here. Appreciate you being here. I know you didn't say a lot on the show, but we enjoyed hearing from you when we did.

1565
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:47,000
So, we'll have you back in a couple years when you're ready to promote your YouTube channel, okay?

1566
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:48,000
Alright.

1567
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:49,000
Alright, sounds good.

1568
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:50,000
Alright.

1569
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:51,000
Yeah.

1570
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:52,000
Yeah, good.

1571
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:57,000
Alright, Loki, thanks as always for being here, my friend. Next year, year 16.

1572
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:58,000
Yeah.

1573
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:02,000
Old enough to drive here at Orange Lounge Radio. Play some games already.

1574
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:03,000
I know.

1575
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:04,000
Make a game already. Get on it.

1576
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:05,000
I'll do it.

1577
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:06,000
Alright, good job.

1578
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:07,000
Any final thoughts?

1579
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
Apparently our dryer's broken.

1580
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:10,000
Woohoo!

1581
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:13,000
So, fun never ends in 2017.

1582
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
What a great start to the new year.

1583
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:16,000
Your dryer broke?

1584
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:17,000
Yes, our clothes dryer is broken.

1585
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:20,000
You know what that means? You're gonna have to hang up all your clothes to dry them.

1586
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:23,000
No, it means you're gonna take them over to my mother-in-law's house to dry them.

1587
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
Well, how did it break?

1588
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
It just, it's like...

1589
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
Somebody took a ride in there.

1590
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
It's like almost nine years old, so...

1591
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:38,000
Alright, as always, I say, if you enjoy what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, please tell a friend or two about the show.

1592
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:43,000
Help us spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, if the voices are actually here to be heard.

1593
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:47,000
Otherwise, my final thought is, bring on the new year.

1594
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:51,000
2017, I am done with you. Goodbye.

1595
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:55,000
And for this week, we're done with all of you out there in Radio Land.
