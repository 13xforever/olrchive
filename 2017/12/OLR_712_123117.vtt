00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
2017 we hardly knew you, well 2017 we bid you a fon, actually 2017 you're done.

00:20.000 --> 00:27.000

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:38.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio

00:38.000 --> 00:46.000
Live today with episode number 712 for this December the 31st, the very last day of 2017.

00:46.000 --> 00:53.000
My name is Rob Roberts. Not joining us live here yet today is DarkSakura or Jamie Sommers.

00:53.000 --> 00:59.000
She'll be joining us over the telephone a little bit later on. But in studio we do have Techmaster Loki.

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
Hello. How are you Loki? I'm good. Happy New Year. Yes.

01:03.000 --> 01:10.000
So real quick, just in case people forgot, we talked about this the last episode of the episode before, but we're actually live a little earlier today

01:10.000 --> 01:18.000
where it's noon on New Years Eve and usually we do our show a little later at 6 o'clock, but for people's plans we figured, you know, let's do the show a little bit earlier today.

01:18.000 --> 01:28.000
But usually we tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network, vog-network.com, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

01:28.000 --> 01:38.000
And if you are listening live, even if you do happen to be here at noon, you maybe saw the tweet or something, you can join us in our chat room and we will be reading whatever comments are there.

01:38.000 --> 01:47.000
Our next live show, the regular stuff, will be January 7th, 2018, New Year. Anyway, so that's a little bit of housekeeping there.

01:47.000 --> 01:54.000
But how are you doing today, Master Loki? I'm fine. Yeah, so this is interesting since we have an earlier show today, you brought somebody else to the show.

01:54.000 --> 02:03.000
Yeah, oddly enough he doesn't want to talk right now because he knew that you had a Switch and he wants to play the Switch.

02:03.000 --> 02:09.000
That's fair, yeah. So yeah, I brought my son Josh. Yeah. And maybe he'll say hi later.

02:09.000 --> 02:14.000
But right now he's too infatuated with Mario Odyssey, right? Yeah, he's too busy playing Mario Odyssey.

02:14.000 --> 02:23.000
That's fine. That's understandable. Mario Odyssey is a pretty fun game. So anyway, we're going to get into some video game news here in a little bit.

02:23.000 --> 02:29.000
I don't think it'll be as long of a show as usual, but we'll try to squeeze in what's been going on around the gaming world.

02:29.000 --> 02:35.000
But there are some things like, you know, there's no video game releases going on right now. It's a little bit slower of a time of year.

02:36.000 --> 02:44.000
I should go on over to our chat room, of course, over at live.vognetwork.com. ActDeft is in chat saying, Loki son, definitely.

02:44.000 --> 02:50.000
I don't know if that's because shy, but you're not shy. No, I think because he's playing video games.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
Playing video games, playing Mario Odyssey. He's busy at talk over video games.

02:53.000 --> 02:59.000
Choosing to do video games over another activity. That maybe makes a little sense. I get it.

02:59.000 --> 03:04.000
Alright, well, let's start at the top of the show here since it is New Year's Eve. It's the end of the year.

03:04.000 --> 03:11.000
This is the time of year when people tend to talk about, oh, what are my New Year's resolutions?

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
For better or for worse. I know not everybody's into them, but I thought I'd ask anyway.

03:15.000 --> 03:20.000
Is there anything that you are wanting to accomplish in gaming in 2018?

03:20.000 --> 03:25.000
And I open that up to our chatters as well. Is there anything you want to accomplish in gaming in 2018, Loki?

03:25.000 --> 03:32.000
I do want to rebuild my DDR pads. I keep bidding on DDR machines, but they never end cheap enough.

03:32.000 --> 03:40.000
So I have now a full set of the acrylic panels from a DDR machine.

03:40.000 --> 03:46.000
Is that nostalgia for Dance Dance Revolution? The reason why? Or is that like I want to have exercise gaming?

03:46.000 --> 03:56.000
Well, yesterday I played laser tag in the first time in a while, and I'm sore after playing that.

03:56.000 --> 04:06.000
I'm like, dude, that's nothing. That is low impact. I need to get my ass in shape now.

04:06.000 --> 04:13.000
That wasn't a yeah of agreement. That was a yeah of I hear you, I understand you.

04:13.000 --> 04:21.000
Yeah, it's just like just to be like, you know, I do, you know, before it gets worse because it's only going to get worse and get harder.

04:21.000 --> 04:29.000
So it's like I didn't realize, like, oh, yeah, I can't do DDR anymore because that's that's too hard, you know, to do what I used to do.

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
But now it's like playing laser tag is like, wow, I'm that sore after playing laser tag.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
OK, so one game of laser tag. Backtrack a little bit.

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
Yesterday you went and you took the kids to go play. Yes, I took them to play their first game of laser.

04:40.000 --> 04:45.000
So walk us through that. So we went to Golf Land to play, you know, they want to play all the games there.

04:45.000 --> 04:51.000
And I said, no, I said, you're going to go play laser tag. And so we did that and they had fun.

04:51.000 --> 04:56.000
They you know, they got laser tag like toys for Christmas.

04:56.000 --> 05:01.000
So they've been playing around with those, but they kind of like, you know, they're cheap and crappy.

05:01.000 --> 05:06.000
So I was like, well, let's play with the actual laser equipment and go in the arena and actually play that and see all that.

05:06.000 --> 05:11.000
So they liked it. All right. But they're my August son's still a bit little.

05:11.000 --> 05:18.000
He's, you know, just about to turn four. And so he got upset because he he lost track of where I was a couple of times.

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
And so, you know, that made him upset. But, you know, he had fun.

05:22.000 --> 05:27.000
And for the most part, he was shooting me. I'm like, you got to shoot the other team, not me.

05:27.000 --> 05:32.000
Shoot the other team. I'm on your team. Is that something like repressed anger from.

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
No, it's just like it's funny. It's like it's I'm shooting you, daddy. Like whatever.

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
As long as he's having fun. I don't really care. So it was just all right.

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
I mean, but the laser type that they have at Golf Land Sunsplash.

05:44.000 --> 05:49.000
I mean, granted, it's not Cuzar. It's it's really old like that.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
I like I played on that. Ironically enough, I played on that.

05:52.000 --> 05:59.000
Probably one of the first games that they ever had there because we actually got to do grad night at Golf Land before it opened to the public.

05:59.000 --> 06:04.000
So I got to play laser tag there. Like one of their first games on brand new equipment.

06:04.000 --> 06:09.000
And it was kind of crappy then. But now they're like really crappy.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
They have these a system called Laser Runner, which is all right.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
Like the new the packs that they have on their Web site now look really nice.

06:15.000 --> 06:20.000
The packs that they're using now looks like someone took. But this place was built in what, like 97 or 98.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
Yeah. It's like they haven't changed since then. Yeah.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
It's just it's been the same equipment like the entire time.

06:26.000 --> 06:34.000
So, I mean, it looks like that they took a laser gun sprayed spray foam all over the crap of that and wrapped it with electrical tape.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
I mean, it's just like this big padded thing. All right.

06:37.000 --> 06:42.000
So you did the laser tag and you your kids were shooting you and you were shooting the other team.

06:42.000 --> 06:47.000
You did OK. But after it was done, you were just I was just a little bit.

06:47.000 --> 06:52.000
Yeah, I wasn't really tired, but it's just like, oh, you know, my legs hurt from that.

06:52.000 --> 06:57.000
Like it shouldn't hurt. Did you stretch first? I did not stretch first.

06:57.000 --> 07:02.000
But like I totally would, you know, like if there's a Q's are nearby every weekend, I'd be there all the time.

07:02.000 --> 07:07.000
Yeah. But it's just, you know, I don't know. It was fun.

07:07.000 --> 07:14.000
But yeah, I do need I do want to build those pads just to utilize my arcade cabinet they have in the garage.

07:14.000 --> 07:19.000
And, you know, I've been buying equipment for it. Like I've got the sheet metal sitting out in my shed.

07:19.000 --> 07:27.000
It's been sitting there for years now. I've got the I bought the actual acrylic arcade arrows,

07:27.000 --> 07:34.000
except three or four of them are like this custom printed stuff and it doesn't match.

07:34.000 --> 07:39.000
But whatever. It's going it's just a thing you step on. So who cares?

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
It doesn't have to look good. It just doesn't have to look at it. It's acrylic.

07:42.000 --> 07:48.000
Who cares of like the decal or the print on it is rubbing off or whatever. It doesn't matter.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
So I thought you're putting this on YouTube or anything. Right. Exactly.

07:51.000 --> 07:58.000
So like all I would need now is just the lumber for it and just hardware, I think, and should build it.

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
Now, will this be another project that you have finished where like you get the up and down arrow done,

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
but there's no left and right arrows? No, I would be able to get done.

08:05.000 --> 08:11.000
Like I the last like I've built pads like several times and the last ones I had,

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
I had a problem with static electricity building up in them.

08:14.000 --> 08:19.000
So it kept shorting out the controller board for it. So like it would work for two minutes

08:19.000 --> 08:23.000
and they would just stop working until you shut the whole thing off and turn it back on again.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
So now, you know, knowing more about that kind of stuff,

08:26.000 --> 08:32.000
I can ground it properly and have, you know, bypass that issue. So I don't know.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
All right. Well, I will hope to do that.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
So whether I get around to it or not.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
So constructing a new DDR exercise thing.

08:39.000 --> 08:44.000
And of course, and of course, the other thing that I've been painfully aware of

08:44.000 --> 08:50.000
and been more so lately now that I've run out of things to build is I got to work on my game again.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
Yes, you do.

08:51.000 --> 08:55.000
So that that's the other thing. It's been kind of in the front of my mind.

08:55.000 --> 09:01.000
Yes, you do. For me, I think everything as far as like my resolutions or whatever you want to call it go,

09:01.000 --> 09:05.000
probably go around live streaming because I was doing really well for a little bit.

09:05.000 --> 09:09.000
You know, I got the affiliate status and then you guys all know I had a really bad year last year.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
And I think it just kind of stopped.

09:11.000 --> 09:18.000
And like it's just, you know, you kind of get in a place where it's like, I don't I don't know if I feel like being extroverted,

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
because I think when you're kind of doing the live stream stuff, you have to be a little bit extroverted.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Or at least I feel that you do.

09:24.000 --> 09:29.000
I mean, I realize some people live stream like literally nothing but just video of them playing.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
But I feel like you got to have a little more interaction.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
So it takes it takes a little more extroversion or whatever.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
So sometimes I just don't always feel it, but I miss it.

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
And I actually did a random live stream again this week, which was my first one in a month.

09:42.000 --> 09:48.000
So that's something I kind of want to get back into, because I think I think I do have a lot of fun with the audience.

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
And especially like when it's things like Mario Kart and things you can play with the other people.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
I think those are some of the best streams that were done.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
So you haven't played?

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
I do.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
No, I have not played that.

09:59.000 --> 10:07.000
No, that is definitely on my agenda for things I want to do in the first couple of weeks of the year, because you speak so highly of it.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
Oh, no, it's incredibly frustrating.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
Yeah.

10:10.000 --> 10:15.000
I guess otherwise it's just catch up on the good old games backlog of which I have quite a bit.

10:15.000 --> 10:22.000
Oh, I should mention this as a little bit of a follow up to something I talked about six weeks ago or so.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
I've allowed the Xbox back on the network.

10:25.000 --> 10:29.000
Do you remember when my Xbox one used like 900 gigs of data or whatever it was?

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
By the way, I did I don't know if I ever mentioned this.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
I did hear from somebody either Twitter or email.

10:35.000 --> 10:41.000
I'm sorry, I forget who and where is a few weeks now, but somebody else reached out and said the same thing happened to them.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
So it wasn't just me.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Thank you very much.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
But I did feel like it was probably quantum break.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
That was the culprit in that whole thing.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
So what I did, I win it.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
I just deleted quantum break.

10:51.000 --> 10:56.000
I was like, if I want to play it again, I'll, you know, just redownload it at that point.

10:56.000 --> 11:00.000
But right now I deleted it and no problems.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
The Xbox has been online. It's been well behaved.

11:02.000 --> 11:08.000
So it was definitely something about that particular patch that was downloading over and over.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
It's just a 900 gigabyte patch.

11:10.000 --> 11:14.000
I guess, I guess all that 4K for that 4K TV, I don't have.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
No, I don't know if we'll ever know the solution.

11:16.000 --> 11:20.000
4K, because that also happens to be how much your cable bill is that much.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
Anyway.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
All right.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
Let's see.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
Going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

11:27.000 --> 11:31.000
Speaking of 4K, Bobby Blackwolf in our chat says,

11:31.000 --> 11:35.000
My 2018 gaming resolution is hopefully going to be 4K.

11:35.000 --> 11:40.000
Had the first two meetings with a local home theater installation company about a room in my basement.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
Holy shit, that's taking it seriously.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
Going to get professional installation.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
That is, that is a man cave.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
That is a supremo.

11:48.000 --> 11:54.000
Although, even though I call it that, it's not like I know Bobby's fiance and she's going to be like,

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
Move, I want to watch Doctor Who in 4K.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
So, even though I say that.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
Let's see.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
Dungeon Buster in chat says,

12:02.000 --> 12:07.000
No huge resolution other than to hope for a better 2018.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
Well, ain't that the truth?

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
I think there's a lot of us that are looking out for that.

12:12.000 --> 12:20.000
This is the part of the year where I think a lot of your favorite shows would talk about their favorite game from the past year.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
Their game of the year, if you will.

12:23.000 --> 12:27.000
Their personal best game that came out in 2017.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Whatever your criteria is.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
I'm kind of curious for you guys in chat what that game might be.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
And, of course, I've got to ask Loki.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
What would be your personal game of the year for 2017?

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
I haven't played a lot of games this year.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
You kind of didn't, yet you still have this podcast.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
Yeah.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
So, you follow gaming culture.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
Well, I bought a lot of games that I didn't play.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
That's true.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
You still buy the games.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
I still buy the games.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
I just didn't get around to them.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
I don't know.

12:51.000 --> 12:56.000
I'm trying to think back to all the things that came out of me.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
I guess I didn't even play through Zelda, really.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
So, I mean, that's kind of bad.

13:04.000 --> 13:10.000
I'm sure that one of Zelda or Super Mario Odyssey would have been probably up there.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
But I never played them.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
Well, you don't have a Switch.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
I don't have a Switch.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
But I played enough of the kiosk.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
And you got the Wii U.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
You have the Wii U Zelda, right?

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
Yeah, we have the Wii U.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
Zelda and Wii U.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
So, I mean, that's alright.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
What the hell did I play this year?

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
I don't even remember.

13:25.000 --> 13:29.000
I probably want to play more Skyrim again.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
No, I would say...

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
Let me think here.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
So...

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
I didn't realize this would be such a hard question for you.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
Yeah, I don't really...

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
I didn't play a whole...

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
I mean, nothing was really stand-out-ish to me.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
I guess South Park, just because that's the last thing I played.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
I mean, even that was kind of...

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
It wasn't as good as the last one, I thought.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
I thought the first one was much better.

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
You know almost everybody out there is talking about what a great fucking year this was for gaming.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
Just for the record.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
There was a lot of strong games this year.

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
So I think at some point you got to catch up on some of these games, for sure.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
Well, yeah.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
I mean, there was a lot of great games that came out, but I didn't bother...

14:14.000 --> 14:18.000
Well, because the first part of the year I was actually trying to work on my games.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
So I did my things for that reason.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
And then the latter half of the year is just like...

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
I don't know.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
I'm too burnt out to play anything.

14:27.000 --> 14:31.000
So even this fall, I picked up South Park.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
I picked up the LEGO Marvel Super Heroes game.

14:33.000 --> 14:37.000
The LEGO Marvel Super Heroes game was just a grind, so it wasn't even that good.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
I don't know. I played a lot of VR in the beginning of the year.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
I can't think of anything that really sticks out.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
Alright.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
For me, it's easy.

14:50.000 --> 14:54.000
My game of the year for 2017 is Super Mario Odyssey, easily.

14:54.000 --> 15:02.000
It kind of gets me to really enjoy 3D Mario games in a way I haven't.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
I don't know if I have ever.

15:04.000 --> 15:10.000
I was never as big on Mario 64 when it was first out as I think other people were.

15:10.000 --> 15:14.000
Although I certainly recognize why it's such a great game and why people really like it.

15:14.000 --> 15:19.000
And I think a lot of the best parts of that game really shine through again in Super Mario Odyssey.

15:19.000 --> 15:28.000
The fact that Mario Odyssey is a game that's very simple in nature, yet there is so much to see and do.

15:28.000 --> 15:32.000
And it's like they kind of took that script that worked very well in Zelda.

15:32.000 --> 15:36.000
Although obviously all these games were in development for a long time, so it's not like they were copying off each other.

15:36.000 --> 15:41.000
But I guess you see Nintendo in general taking this more open world approach.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
And I think that worked really well in Mario Odyssey.

15:45.000 --> 15:52.000
Which I suppose is not too dissimilar from how Mario 64 originally was, really.

15:52.000 --> 15:56.000
But I think there's something about having the boat and traveling back and forth.

15:56.000 --> 16:03.000
And the fact that you open up more after you beat the main story and so forth.

16:03.000 --> 16:11.000
I kind of feel like it even gives it more of that sense of openness than I think I even felt when I did play Mario 64.

16:11.000 --> 16:18.000
Even the minimal online components where you have some of the leaderboards with friends and so forth.

16:18.000 --> 16:24.000
And just the variety of costumes and especially some of the way they handle the retro 8-bit stuff and all of that.

16:24.000 --> 16:29.000
I think it just adds up to what was just a stellar gaming experience for me this year.

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
Mario Odyssey absolutely will be my game of the year.

16:32.000 --> 16:36.000
Let me check and chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

16:37.000 --> 16:45.000
Let's see. Bobby Black Wolf in chat says most lists have Zelda, Mario, Cuphead, Resident Evil 7, Horizon Zero, Dawn.

16:45.000 --> 16:49.000
Player Unknown Battlegrounds came out on the 20th so that counts.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Bobby also points out Persona 5.

16:52.000 --> 16:57.000
Act F says I would put Cuphead as my top 5. Yeah, Cuphead was great.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
Cuphead was a good game.

16:58.000 --> 17:08.000
Cuphead was, especially the art direction and the way they really did transform that whole 1930s cartoon style into what is essentially a shoot-em-up game.

17:08.000 --> 17:16.000
It's great. That game is a stellar experience so it's definitely worth checking out if you haven't yet.

17:16.000 --> 17:20.000
Bobby in chat says I wasn't as big on Mario 64 either.

17:20.000 --> 17:24.000
When Mario Odyssey got rid of the lives mechanic, that's what got me.

17:25.000 --> 17:30.000
I'm fine losing 10 coins if I die. I'm not fine if I lose one of my last 3 lives.

17:30.000 --> 17:40.000
Yeah, it is interesting how they changed that and I think since the game is more open, where do lives in that traditional sense,

17:40.000 --> 17:45.000
going all the way back to the original Super Mario Brothers, where do lives fit in in that picture?

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
Where does the story begin and end?

17:47.000 --> 17:53.000
Those lines are blurred a little bit so I think that's kind of why you have to get away from lives a little bit and look at instead

17:53.000 --> 17:57.000
other ways to penalize the player if they die, which coins is a good mechanic.

17:57.000 --> 18:04.000
It's also good too because a lot of the moons in the game that you have to get are very technical to get to certain places

18:04.000 --> 18:12.000
and so it kind of allows you to challenge yourself to get to places because you know that the repercussion for failing is not that big.

18:12.000 --> 18:22.000
So anyway, sorry, I was reading. So DarkSakura actually joined our chat room over at live.vognetware.com.

18:22.000 --> 18:28.000
I'm not sure how much of this I want to say because I would like her to be here to talk through this at some point,

18:28.000 --> 18:35.000
but you could probably guess what one of her top 3 games would be based on certain franchises.

18:35.000 --> 18:40.000
I know! I was surprised too when she said Halo was her top franchise of the year.

18:41.000 --> 18:45.000
You're just asking for a beating. You're asking for a beating.

18:45.000 --> 18:52.000
Whereas, I understand it can't be the classic game of the week, but to make your 2017 top game of the year, I mean, that is just...

18:52.000 --> 18:56.000
She's gonna come back. She's gonna show back up here and you're gonna be dead.

18:56.000 --> 19:01.000
And then I'm gonna have to explain why Loki's missing all these shows in a row. That's gonna be what happens.

19:01.000 --> 19:08.000
So anyway, I think I will wait for JB to come back and let her reveal those herself, which I don't know if she'll be back next week

19:08.000 --> 19:15.000
or in a couple weeks, but we'll find out. Anyway, let's see, going to chat over at live.vognetware.com.

19:15.000 --> 19:22.000
Now, something I will mention that JB's saying in chat, when Dan and I were first together, we kind of bonded over Mario 64 and Symphony of the Night.

19:22.000 --> 19:27.000
Well, there's certainly always going to be some games, I think.

19:27.000 --> 19:33.000
Obviously, I don't think there's anybody that's gonna dispute that Mario 64 and Symphony of the Night aren't really good games,

19:34.000 --> 19:41.000
but I think there's always gonna be sentimental stuff. I think that you played maybe when you were younger or at a certain key time in your life,

19:41.000 --> 19:46.000
and so maybe that's why you tend to like games maybe a little more than other people.

19:46.000 --> 19:52.000
It kind of ties into what our pal Bobby has said on his show about Final Fantasy games for a long time,

19:52.000 --> 19:57.000
that your favorite Final Fantasy game tends to be the one that was out when you were 12,

19:57.000 --> 20:05.000
which, whether that exact science is true or not specifically for you, I think that age is tied to a lot of sentimental things,

20:05.000 --> 20:12.000
so I think maybe those two kind of things are tied, is that you tend to, things that have a sentimental tie to them,

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
you're always gonna remember a little more fondly than other people.

20:15.000 --> 20:22.000
And maybe, just maybe, y'all, when we talk about how we get in those, I call them fake arguments, I don't think they're real,

20:22.000 --> 20:26.000
maybe they're real for you, I don't know, but when we talk about how Super Metroid, I believe, is the best game that was ever made,

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
yeah, there's probably some sentimental stuff that comes into that.

20:29.000 --> 20:34.000
I played that game a lot in college when I didn't have a lot of other stuff going on,

20:34.000 --> 20:38.000
so I think there's, you know, for me, maybe that's got some sentimental stuff in it.

20:38.000 --> 20:44.000
And Bobby already, you know, early announcing that his game of 2018 is gonna be Ni No Kuni 2.

20:44.000 --> 20:48.000
Very courageous, all these like big, you know, announcements today.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
That's a big, that's hedging a big bet.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
It's just crazy.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
That game might get delayed again, we'll see.

20:53.000 --> 21:03.000
Let's see, VOG 338, somebody going a little anonymous in our chat, saying Mario Kart was my game.

21:03.000 --> 21:08.000
So, yeah, well, you know, some people, I don't know if that's Mario Kart in the past, like a sentimental game,

21:08.000 --> 21:14.000
or Mario Kart 8 on Switch was game of the year, because some people didn't discover it till this year,

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
because not everybody bought the Wii U.

21:16.000 --> 21:23.000
Did you see that news story this week about how the Switch lifetime sales in Japan have already exceeded Wii U's lifetime sales?

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
In just the less than a year it's been out.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
Yeah, I believe it.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
Yeah, I believe it too, but it's, you know.

21:28.000 --> 21:35.000
Which is still surprising, which we'll get to later, that certain things aren't implemented or done yet, Nintendo.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
Come on.

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
Well, maybe we'll find a little more about that as we continue on with the show.

21:39.000 --> 21:43.000
So, ActDeft also pointing out another game that I hear a lot about.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
Sonic Mania is definitely great.

21:45.000 --> 21:49.000
DungeonBuster also saying Sonic Mania was so good in SSA 100M.

21:49.000 --> 21:52.000
Sonic Mania is in my top three game of the year.

21:52.000 --> 21:56.000
Yeah, I think a lot of people are very pleased with what happened with Sonic, for sure.

21:58.000 --> 22:03.000
Okay, let's talk a little more current and talk about our gaming weeks,

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
and then we'll get into some of the news that happened this week.

22:05.000 --> 22:09.000
Loki, I don't know, I mean, you already kind of mentioned you've been a little slower on the games this year,

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
but did you get to play any games this week? How was your gaming week?

22:12.000 --> 22:15.000
I didn't play any VR games, unfortunately.

22:15.000 --> 22:21.000
I did finish South Park, The Fractured But Whole, and then I started going into DLC stuff.

22:21.000 --> 22:29.000
But, you know, having played The Sick of Truth, I think that was a better story than The Fractured But Whole.

22:29.000 --> 22:37.000
The Fractured But Whole is funny, but at the end it just kind of seemed very rushed and just kind of like,

22:37.000 --> 22:42.000
I don't know. It was alright. It just wasn't as hilarious.

22:42.000 --> 22:50.000
Because the whole Sick of Truth was more of the kids playing this role-playing game type thing,

22:50.000 --> 22:53.000
and this other thing going on in the background that was ridiculous.

22:53.000 --> 22:59.000
And then this one was more about superheroes, and the thing that's ridiculous going on in the background

22:59.000 --> 23:03.000
is heavily involved in what they're doing.

23:03.000 --> 23:09.000
So it wasn't kind of like they're oblivious to this whole thing, or people are oblivious to what's going on.

23:09.000 --> 23:16.000
It's just, I don't know, it was ridiculous. But just not as funny as the first game.

23:16.000 --> 23:21.000
And then the DLC that I'm playing right now is kind of like this Danger Room thing, so it's just these really hard battles.

23:21.000 --> 23:25.000
And it's just like a grind. There's not really any point to doing it other than,

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
oh, I beat this on really hard difficulty.

23:28.000 --> 23:34.000
I didn't even play that game on hard difficulty, because all it does is give the AI more...

23:34.000 --> 23:40.000
It makes the battles longer, and I don't really want to sit there fighting all the time for a very long time

23:40.000 --> 23:46.000
about the story to progress. But at least the Danger Room stuff, you have to play it on the highest difficulty.

23:46.000 --> 23:52.000
It wasn't that difficult, it just took longer. I don't know.

23:52.000 --> 23:56.000
It's alright, though. I like the game. I recommend it, but it's just...

23:56.000 --> 24:02.000
If you're going into it thinking, the combat system's pretty good, but I think the story in the first game was better.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
Alright.

24:04.000 --> 24:08.000
And then, as far as other games, I played more Pokémon Go and actually a little bit of Ingress,

24:08.000 --> 24:12.000
because we can go in different parks, so I hit whatever portals are nearby.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
New stuff. Here you go.

24:14.000 --> 24:20.000
Yeah, new stuff. But I'm gonna try to get into more things again next year.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
Okay.

24:22.000 --> 24:30.000
To register participation with this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, smile.

24:30.000 --> 24:36.000
Mike Gaming Week. Well, I mean, I didn't play a lot of new stuff that I can think of this week.

24:36.000 --> 24:42.000
It was mostly revisiting, especially a lot of Blizzard stuff, because I've still been playing a little World of Warcraft here and there,

24:42.000 --> 24:48.000
although I did also play Final Fantasy XIV. See, I am kind of juggling both MMOs, because I went and I got that bear mount for Christmas.

24:48.000 --> 24:54.000
This is super adorable. You ride this little bear and you throw presents at people. It's really cute, so I like that.

24:54.000 --> 24:59.000
And then I was playing Heroes of the Storm, which I've been playing off and on for a few months now.

24:59.000 --> 25:06.000
And then I finally played Overwatch, which I was actually streaming a little bit, and then there were some that I didn't stream.

25:06.000 --> 25:10.000
I was actually playing some Overwatch this week, so I was kind of getting back into that.

25:10.000 --> 25:15.000
And again, it's this masterful thing that Blizzard has done through games like Heroes of the Storm.

25:15.000 --> 25:19.000
I start playing it going, and this is what kind of got me back in a while. I was like,

25:19.000 --> 25:24.000
oh, playing Malfurion in Heroes of the Storm is kind of fun. I miss the Druid healing stuff, so I go play that.

25:24.000 --> 25:31.000
And now it's with Heroes of the Storm, it's like, oh, playing Lucio and Junkrat is kind of fun, and I should go play Overwatch again.

25:31.000 --> 25:37.000
So god damn you, Blizzard, for finding a really good formula that kind of works with all your properties.

25:37.000 --> 25:42.000
I guess I've just been lucky that I haven't been sucked into the whole Blizzard thing, because I tried Overwatch and I just never got into it.

25:42.000 --> 25:48.000
I tried it, and I bought it, and... no. Just not interesting.

25:48.000 --> 25:54.000
See, it's controversial what I'm going to say, but I don't know if maybe the experience is different on console versus PC.

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
But then again, I know some people that swear by consoles and they love it.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
I play on PC.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
Oh, gee, I thought you played on console.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
I play with a controller on PC.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Okay, now that's just weird.

26:04.000 --> 26:08.000
Well, I have a touchpad. I can't play keyboard mouse with a touchpad.

26:09.000 --> 26:16.000
I have a mouse, but I don't have any place to put a mouse on a couch, so I play with a controller.

26:16.000 --> 26:23.000
I mean, it's fine, I like a controller, but it's not that I keep dying or anything, it's just that I just don't find the game interesting.

26:23.000 --> 26:29.000
Let's see, going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Valagas in chat says,

26:29.000 --> 26:33.000
I'm with Loki on Overwatch, yet Act F says, I love Overwatch.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
Well, a lot of people love Overwatch.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
I'm not knocking it, it's a great game.

26:37.000 --> 26:40.000
It's just, I can't get into it for some reason. I don't know.

26:40.000 --> 26:49.000
TigerKlaue in chat says, I guess you could say 2017 was Overwatch's year, so much so they managed to get themselves featured in the upcoming Ready Player One movie for next year.

26:49.000 --> 26:52.000
Yeah, I mean, see, that's the thing.

26:52.000 --> 26:56.000
Like, Ready Player One, I'm ultra hyped for that.

26:56.000 --> 27:00.000
That, I used to have, like, I used to be that way with games, too.

27:00.000 --> 27:03.000
Like, certain games would be like, oh my god, I can't fucking wait to play that game.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
Right.

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
You know, but it's just, not feeling it now.

27:07.000 --> 27:12.000
Red Dead Redemption 2, maybe? But I'm not even, like, I'm kind of cooling down to that game.

27:12.000 --> 27:16.000
What is it? Is that, is that just, you know that you don't have the same time that you used to?

27:16.000 --> 27:19.000
Or is that this whole stuff that's happening with loot boxes?

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
Well, it's just, I know that they're going to have a big online portion.

27:22.000 --> 27:28.000
Red Dead Redemption, I never was into it as much as Grand Theft Auto, but it was a great game.

27:28.000 --> 27:34.000
I just never finished it, or as I finished all the Grand Theft Auto games.

27:34.000 --> 27:41.000
But, I don't know, I just, like, if they announced a Grand Theft Auto 6, I'd be pretty hyped for that.

27:41.000 --> 27:49.000
It's just now, though, like, I'm a little disappointed that they didn't do any single player DLC for Grand Theft Auto 5.

27:49.000 --> 27:54.000
Because they had, like, planned some nice stuff, but then they made too much money online, and they're like, ah, forget that.

27:54.000 --> 27:57.000
We're just going to put all our resources in the online, which is fine. Online's pretty good.

27:57.000 --> 28:03.000
Apparently, and there's a lot to do now, but I just haven't, I've been so out of it for a long time that, I don't know.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
Alright.

28:05.000 --> 28:16.000
Well, you know, I think with Overwatch, I think there's a lot of people that, you know, are still, or at least I'm kind of getting the sense, you know, reading blogs and people's personal game of the year and Twitter and stuff.

28:16.000 --> 28:20.000
There's some people that are saying, you know, Overwatch was kind of my game of the year this year, too.

28:20.000 --> 28:28.000
It's the game that I just play a lot of because they add maps, they add characters, they do different things in the competitive seasons.

28:28.000 --> 28:31.000
They kind of, you know, kind of keep people engaged with Overwatch.

28:31.000 --> 28:35.000
So for some people, it was kind of their game of the year 2017 and 2016.

28:35.000 --> 28:45.000
That's just the interesting thing about the gaming world we live in now, how games metamorphosize and change through patches and either pay expansions or not pay expansions.

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
Yeah.

28:46.000 --> 28:53.000
So, you know, in many ways, I would say Final Fantasy XIV Stormblood, that expansion was one of the better things that was released this year.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
But where does that kind of fit in, you know?

28:55.000 --> 29:03.000
Yeah. And then, like, also in a lot of the games I was looking forward to in the fourth quarter this year were ruined by microtransactions and stuff.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
Like, I was looking forward to the new Battlefront game.

29:05.000 --> 29:15.000
Like, it looked cool because, like, oh, hey, you know, the fact that you're playing, you know, the bad guy, which apparently, spoiler, you turned to the light side, like, immediately.

29:16.000 --> 29:22.000
I mean, it would have been better if you stayed on as the villain and that, like, that's more interesting.

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
Yeah.

29:23.000 --> 29:26.000
You know, but no, we didn't do that.

29:26.000 --> 29:31.000
And then they ruined all of it with just, like, shoving this microtransaction stuff down your throat.

29:31.000 --> 29:39.000
What? I still kind of think that, I think because of all this vast negativity and some of the things we're going to get into here at the top of the show, I think loot boxes are done for.

29:39.000 --> 29:43.000
I know you kind of still think that there's companies, maybe in free-to-play games they'll still be there.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
No.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
I think they're done for. I really do.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
They're not. I don't think so at all.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
We'll see.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
I think they're going to still do this.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
We'll see.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
It's going to get worse.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
That's going to be something for the time capsule for next year.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
That will be for the time capsule.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
Which, by the way, some of you might be asking, why aren't you opening the time capsule tonight?

29:57.000 --> 30:01.000
We want to do it when we're live at our normal time so we have, you know, our usual turnout here.

30:01.000 --> 30:04.000
And we would like Jamie to be here so that we can all kind of do it together.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
So, we'll do that at our first show back.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
Yeah.

30:07.000 --> 30:11.000
But I will say, oh, I guess a little bit of housekeeping because we're going to get into housekeeping here.

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
I am going to try to get more guests on the show in 2020.

30:14.000 --> 30:17.000
I know I always say that and then we'll get a bunch of guests and then it kind of fizzles out.

30:17.000 --> 30:21.000
But certainly if you know somebody who's developing a game or somebody that wants to come promote, you know...

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
Should we try to do another game jam?

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
And this time actually go through with it?

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
No.

30:27.000 --> 30:31.000
I would want to make sure it's defined a little better than it was last time.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
So, we can talk about that.

30:34.000 --> 30:38.000
But as far... and that's not a knock. It's just more like definition for like...

30:38.000 --> 30:43.000
So that I don't feel like I'm holding the whole thing up by, you know, not participating in certain ways.

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
So, I just kind of want to...

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
Well, how can we better quantify our role in that whole thing? That's all.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
Anyway.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
Shoot. Now you can...

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
There was only one entry that was never submitted.

30:52.000 --> 30:55.000
Yeah. Yeah.

30:55.000 --> 30:58.000
To be fair, I said I tried to do something too and it was just...

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
I did try to go in Unity and learn.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
I probably learned more about Unity than I knew before because of it.

31:02.000 --> 31:05.000
So, I would say little accomplishment. Nothing else.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
But anyway.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
I did finish one thing this year.

31:09.000 --> 31:12.000
I mean, it was a project for work.

31:12.000 --> 31:16.000
But it technically was a built thing.

31:16.000 --> 31:19.000
It was a tech demo and it was finished.

31:19.000 --> 31:22.000
So, it's one thing that's somewhat finished.

31:22.000 --> 31:25.000
There you go. Grasp the straws where you can.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
I'll take that.

31:26.000 --> 31:32.000
Anyway, I will say you can look forward to January 14th here on the show.

31:32.000 --> 31:35.000
That is when I'm planning the Ladies of Ingress night.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
So, that'll be fun.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
Hooray!

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
That'll be fun.

31:38.000 --> 31:41.000
So, if you don't know much about that game, even though we talk about it once in a while,

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
we're gonna have a lot to talk about that night.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
So, that should be fun.

31:44.000 --> 31:48.000
And the gals that'll be here are really funny.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
So, it's gonna be a fun show.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
Even if you don't play that game and you don't really give a hoot about it,

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
I think you'll have a good time.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Did you find Pepper or anything?

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
We couldn't gain one on the blue side?

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
There's too many green people that want to come.

32:00.000 --> 32:03.000
It's gonna be as fair and balanced as Fox News that night.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
That's all I can say.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
Well, here's my thing.

32:06.000 --> 32:10.000
I don't want to talk about stupid drama, faction war stuff.

32:10.000 --> 32:13.000
I don't want to talk about that other stuff.

32:13.000 --> 32:18.000
This show is really highbrow and so I'm trying not to bring it down with that other stuff.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
So, yeah.

32:19.000 --> 32:23.000
We're gonna just keep it focused on accomplishments and positives and all that good stuff.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
Alright, anyway.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
Where was I?

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
Oh, yes.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
We're gonna get into...

32:31.000 --> 32:36.000
Oh, I guess as far as other housekeeping goes, there's no shows off that I know of coming up.

32:36.000 --> 32:39.000
We should be here pretty regularly on Sunday nights.

32:39.000 --> 32:44.000
I don't even have any conventions scheduled until August, really, at this point.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
So, I don't know.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
I don't know if I'll be doing anything early next year.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
We'll kind of see.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
I'm not doing Nightfest, sadly.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
Oh, yeah.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.000
The indie arcade will be in April.

32:52.000 --> 32:53.000
So, there'll be that.

32:53.000 --> 32:54.000
Hopefully.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
I mean, I haven't had confirmation on that, but I'm pretty sure it's gonna happen.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
So, that'll be good.

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
Oh, and Bobby says March 25th.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
That's not a gaming convention.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
Oh, right.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
But I'm gonna be out of town that Sunday anyway.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.000
You're right.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
Okay, so that's...

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
Yeah.

33:08.000 --> 33:12.000
The end of March will be a show that will be missing for not a convention reason, but

33:12.000 --> 33:13.000
personal reasons.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.000
Yeah.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
Alright.

33:15.000 --> 33:18.000
Anyway, in the meantime, let's get into some gaming news, talk about what's going on in

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
the gaming world.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
Okay.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
So, let's start off with an extremely positive story.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
Okay, just kidding.

33:23.000 --> 33:26.000
It's not extremely positive because it's 2017.

33:26.000 --> 33:31.000
So, you may be familiar with swatting the whole thing where if you don't like what someone's

33:31.000 --> 33:37.000
doing, you call in a fake police report and the swat arrives at their house and scares

33:37.000 --> 33:38.000
them.

33:38.000 --> 33:41.000
Oh, it's so hilarious, isn't it?

33:41.000 --> 33:46.000
So, apparently there was a couple people that were involved with a Call of Duty match where

33:46.000 --> 33:51.000
they had a bet of $1.50 running on the match and apparently they lost.

33:51.000 --> 33:56.000
And there were words had between them and they started arguing.

33:56.000 --> 34:01.000
And so, apparently the one guy threatened to swat the other guy and so he got this guy

34:01.000 --> 34:06.000
by the name of Swatastic to swat him.

34:06.000 --> 34:15.000
And the player, I guess Miracle, he had taunted the Swatastic guy because he was trying to

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
dox him to get his address.

34:17.000 --> 34:20.000
And so, he said, well, here's my address, come swat me.

34:20.000 --> 34:23.000
You're just going to get jail time if you do that.

34:23.000 --> 34:24.000
And so, he did.

34:24.000 --> 34:27.000
He swatted him and come to find out it wasn't his address.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.000
And so, what happened?

34:28.000 --> 34:31.000
Well, the police arrived.

34:31.000 --> 34:40.000
The guy that was at the house heard a commotion outside, opened the door and was shot to death.

34:40.000 --> 34:43.000
And so, now he's dead.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
His children don't have a dad anymore.

34:45.000 --> 34:50.000
And this guy basically thought he got away with it.

34:50.000 --> 34:56.000
Well, then he went on to Drama Alert, a YouTube channel, and bragged about what he did and stuff.

34:56.000 --> 35:02.000
And then, finally, the LAPD did catch him and so now he's under arrest.

35:05.000 --> 35:08.000
So, I hate that this story is tied to video gaming.

35:09.000 --> 35:13.000
No offense, I realize it's something a lot of blogs and people are talking about.

35:13.000 --> 35:18.000
And that's what we bring to the table each week, even if it's not, hooray, a new game being released.

35:18.000 --> 35:25.000
But it really sounds like this whole video game thing is completely secondary to the other issues going on here.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
Because it could have been $1.50 on a sports game.

35:27.000 --> 35:33.000
It could have been $1.50 on a You Got Served dance battle.

35:33.000 --> 35:36.000
There's a whole lot of people to blame here.

35:36.000 --> 35:42.000
I mean, first off, this guy brags about swatting MLG events and stuff like that.

35:42.000 --> 35:47.000
He thinks it's funny to have people evacuate buildings and watch it on TV.

35:47.000 --> 35:50.000
Well, what a bunch of, and I hope your kid isn't listening so say this quietly,

35:50.000 --> 35:54.000
but what a bunch of fucking assholes just being fucking assholes.

35:54.000 --> 35:58.000
That's what this is. This is just a story about assholes being assholes.

35:58.000 --> 36:04.000
And it's horrible. It's horrible what's happened that an innocent person basically got killed in this whole thing.

36:04.000 --> 36:07.000
These are grown adults that are doing this kind of stuff.

36:07.000 --> 36:12.000
And I don't think anybody in our audience really does this or is into this or whatever,

36:12.000 --> 36:17.000
but my plea would be to anybody out there is don't watch these YouTubes.

36:17.000 --> 36:24.000
Don't support these things. Call people out when they're being stupid about this swatting stuff because look at what happened.

36:24.000 --> 36:30.000
And the guy wasn't even involved in it. The guy that got killed is a complete innocent bystander.

36:30.000 --> 36:35.000
And it's not like this is the first time swatting has happened. We've seen this stupid stuff happen on Twitch

36:35.000 --> 36:40.000
and throughout all the drama that's happened in gaming in the past couple years and so forth.

36:40.000 --> 36:45.000
It's not like this is the first time. But unfortunately, I think a lot of people said at that time,

36:45.000 --> 36:49.000
what's it going to take for people to take this seriously? Is somebody going to have to die?

36:49.000 --> 36:54.000
Well, here we are. We've reached that point because nobody took it seriously before.

36:54.000 --> 37:02.000
And now it sucks. And I'm sorry to be so bleh about it, but that's the reality is here we are.

37:02.000 --> 37:09.000
You know, thank God this guy is in jail. You know, he should be spanked publicly.

37:09.000 --> 37:15.000
Naughty, naughty, naughty. Actually, more than that. But anyway, I'll leave that to the...

37:15.000 --> 37:21.000
The guy that called it in was 25 years old. It's like a grown adult.

37:21.000 --> 37:25.000
It's just I don't understand how these people are out there.

37:25.000 --> 37:29.000
You know, and his like he was, you know, like I said on Twitter, he was kind of saying, you know,

37:29.000 --> 37:34.000
I didn't get anyone killed because I didn't discharge a weapon and being a SWAT member isn't my profession.

37:34.000 --> 37:39.000
And yeah, the police, I think, are a little bit to blame here. Well, they're definitely to blame here, too,

37:39.000 --> 37:45.000
because what did you expect was going to happen? You're making a commotion outside, you know,

37:45.000 --> 37:50.000
and the guy opens the door unarmed to see what's going on and you immediately shoot him.

37:50.000 --> 37:56.000
You don't say, hey, get down on the ground or anything like that. It's just that open fire.

37:56.000 --> 37:59.000
A whole nother issue, I think, that needs to be explored, too.

37:59.000 --> 38:04.000
But much bigger than what this show can get into, you know, that type of thing.

38:04.000 --> 38:09.000
But obviously there's just a lot of like stuff in the story where it's like this all sucks.

38:09.000 --> 38:16.000
All of it. It sucks. And as in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com,

38:16.000 --> 38:20.000
Valagis in chat says we gamers get trashed again because of an a-hole.

38:20.000 --> 38:25.000
Yeah. And that's what it is. And that's unfortunately why we have to bring it up on this show.

38:25.000 --> 38:30.000
But I think it's an opportunity for us to kind of say, OK, this ain't funny.

38:30.000 --> 38:35.000
And I'm going to let other people know it's not funny and I'm not going to follow it and I'm not going to support it.

38:35.000 --> 38:39.000
And that's kind of what MXC in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says.

38:39.000 --> 38:47.000
This is disgusting. And I'm glad I don't understand why or I'm glad I don't understand why anyone finds it humorous to do this stuff.

38:47.000 --> 38:52.000
It's not. They had a was an interview with the I don't know who it was.

38:52.000 --> 38:56.000
It was like the the wife or the sister or something like that, basically.

38:56.000 --> 39:03.000
So after they because they called him basically that he was in a hostage situation, is holding his family hostage.

39:03.000 --> 39:06.000
And he was I don't know if he had killed somebody or something like that.

39:06.000 --> 39:11.000
So basically they took down who they thought was the hostage taker.

39:11.000 --> 39:19.000
And then they made they arrested the hostages as well and had them walk over their dead dad, like step over their dead dad.

39:19.000 --> 39:29.000
And as they brought him outside, it was like like kids. Like it just the whole thing sounds like it was handled terribly.

39:29.000 --> 39:38.000
I don't know. I mean, I understand, though, that a lot of law enforcement has to take some of this stuff seriously, because what if it was a serious situation?

39:38.000 --> 39:41.000
Right. You don't want to, you know, the boy who cried wolf, that type of situation.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
Well, you don't want to shoot first, ask questions later.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
I definitely agree with that element of that.

39:45.000 --> 39:53.000
Because how many times have we had problems with that or just over, you know, an excessive force being used in situations?

39:53.000 --> 40:01.000
Yeah. Anyway. All right. That's it. I don't want to talk about stupid people doing horrible, horrible things any longer.

40:01.000 --> 40:07.000
Let's move on to something that actually really does impact gaming. And this could be setting an interesting tone for 2018.

40:07.000 --> 40:15.000
And it's a new rule out of Apple. Apple and this kind of quietly. I say quietly because, well, I mean, obviously blogs are picking up on it.

40:15.000 --> 40:20.000
But that kind of happened in that slower holiday period. And so I'm not sure everybody's really picked up that this has happened.

40:20.000 --> 40:29.000
But Apple has put a new guideline for games coming to the App Store. And this is targeting, I suppose, microtransaction.

40:29.000 --> 40:42.000
As part of the new policy, which you can see on Apple's website, Apple will now require games on the App Store that features microtransactions and loot boxes to disclose the possibility of winning a certain loot or item.

40:42.000 --> 40:47.000
Where we've heard this before, which was the big China law that some people have been talking about.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
Good. I think it's a great thing that they're doing.

40:49.000 --> 41:07.000
Yeah. So anyway, the rule specifically states in the guidelines for App Store approvals, quote, apps offering loot boxes or other mechanisms that provide randomized virtual items for purchase must disclose the odds of receiving each type of item to customers prior to purchase.

41:07.000 --> 41:18.000
So does that mean that they have to disclose it like an end user license agreement or like when I go to purchase that loot box that says it pops up a screen showing me the odds of everything?

41:18.000 --> 41:29.000
That's a really good question. And unfortunately, I don't think it's really clear. It's not clear here. So we'll have to see what kind of happens from what Apple starts accepting from what they don't start accepting.

41:29.000 --> 41:42.000
Now, this same policy doesn't show up on the Google Play Store. But since most people kind of have to do their apps for both these days, right, if you really want to get everybody, you got to do Apple and Google, although some things get away with it.

41:42.000 --> 41:49.000
Like HQ still is on Android, right? That game's a big frickin' deal. And it's still not an Android, right? Or it's going to be soon? I don't know.

41:49.000 --> 41:58.000
And then some things, you know, like with Mario Run came out on iOS first and then with the Fire Emblem thing was out on Android first. You know, some things, but eventually they're kind of out for both.

41:58.000 --> 42:10.000
But my point is, is that even though Google doesn't have this rule, like it's probably going to start showing up even if you have an Android device just because programmers are just going to make the same game for both.

42:10.000 --> 42:26.000
Well, no, not necessarily. I don't think that they'd volunteer that information. I think that they'll only show it if they have to. What I could see them implementing that is if they start having more pressure from like the ESA is going to really put any pressure on them.

42:26.000 --> 42:39.000
But it's like, you know, this whole movement right now with government where they're trying to, I think, put out a Senate bill or something like that saying, hey, we need to crack down on these loot boxes because there's several states now led by Hawaii.

42:39.000 --> 42:42.000
I thought Hawaii was doing that in Hawaii.

42:42.000 --> 42:58.000
No, there's other congressmen that are actually working on it as well. Or at least they have support by other states. So it may start in Hawaii and then may move on. So who knows?

42:58.000 --> 43:03.000
That's another reason why I'm thinking loot boxes are kind of done, but we'll see.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
We'll find a way around it.

43:06.000 --> 43:18.000
Anyway, over in chat, over at live.vognetwork.com, actf says that's a good rule. Dungeon Buster says if you have to start somewhere with self-regulating loot boxes, one could say Apple is as good and as big a proponent as any.

43:18.000 --> 43:31.000
So that's another interesting angle is that is Apple doing this to quote unquote self-regulate to stop maybe a lot of this talk about Hawaii, et cetera, getting in on a movement to regulate something?

43:31.000 --> 43:35.000
Maybe. I think that could be a huge part of it, too.

43:35.000 --> 43:46.000
Well, interesting. It'll be interesting to see how this could affect games in 2018. We haven't really seen the results of this yet because then Apple kind of went in that dark approval, which is normal.

43:46.000 --> 43:57.000
Between Christmas and New Year, there's not really a lot of approvals getting through. But I think as we get into January, I'm assuming that if games want to do updates, they're going to have to conform to this, right?

43:57.000 --> 44:07.000
I mean, maybe the games that are already out there are going to stay out there, but now games as they update are going to have to implement this. So it's going to be interesting to see how that changes things in 2018.

44:07.000 --> 44:10.000
We'll see. All right, moving on. Next story, Loki.

44:10.000 --> 44:23.000
So you remember that whole kind of Easter egg that they had in the Switch operating system that hid the game Golf, the NES game Golf in there?

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
It was the tribute to Iwata, right?

44:25.000 --> 44:41.000
Yes, the tribute to Iwata. Well, apparently they are removing it. So according to hackers, data miners, I should say, the Switch update 4.0 takes the Flog code that was in there, removes all of it and the executable and overrides it with garbage data.

44:42.000 --> 44:59.000
So that's kind of unfortunate. So I don't know what the point of that is. Why? Was it because they didn't know that was in there? It was like some coder hid that in there and they didn't like it? I mean, that's kind of lame. I don't know what the point would be behind that.

44:59.000 --> 45:13.000
Yeah, I'm not sure why. Maybe they got frustrated at how much this was taking off when it was supposed to be kind of like a hidden tribute type of thing. Or maybe they realized they could charge for this. I don't know. That's what the cynical side, I think, says a lot of people.

45:13.000 --> 45:17.000
It's golf. Come on. We're missing out on that $10.

45:19.000 --> 45:33.000
The golf on the NES was, you know, it's not a game that aged gracefully. Back in the day, you know, it was golf. It was about as good as you could get, but it hasn't aged gracefully compared to a lot of stuff today.

45:33.000 --> 45:56.000
That's like removing nibbles or gorillas from, you know, Q Basic 5 and DOS or something like that. It's like, they're shitty. It's a shitty game that's super old that, who cares? You've made your money. You've made your money on that. I hope it's not financially motivated because if it is, that's super lame.

45:56.000 --> 46:09.000
So Bobby in Chat is saying that it was supposed to be a blessing never to be unopened. It's part of the Japanese custom, and it's not about money or anything like that. It was kind of supposed to be removed because the data miners opened it.

46:09.000 --> 46:18.000
So basically, it was intended to be hidden the whole time, and because it got opened, it's like Pandora's box got unleashed or whatever.

46:18.000 --> 46:21.000
Then don't make a way to activate it. That's so dumb.

46:21.000 --> 46:36.000
Well, Loki, I kind of get it. I actually kind of get it. It was a hidden secret thing. But here's the thing. At the end of the day, this is what I will agree with. At the end of the day, okay, they buried this thing and they made it very hard to get to because it was supposed to be a blessing and all that stuff.

46:36.000 --> 46:48.000
But at the end of the day, somebody forgot that rule, and that is hackers gonna hack. Right? So of course somebody was gonna find this eventually. So, you know, that's the whole thing.

46:49.000 --> 47:01.000
I understand why maybe it was supposed to be the secret thing that wasn't supposed to get out, and then when it got out, it became about, ooh, hidden game, and not about, it's a tribute, actually, type of thing.

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
Don't mod it and put it back in there.

47:03.000 --> 47:09.000
Yeah, that's interesting. You say that tongue in cheek, but I bet you people will.

47:10.000 --> 47:22.000
There was, and I was seeing some of the chat on Discord. I didn't put it in our, which by the way, just a plug for our VOG Network Discord if you're not there. It's a lot of fun conversations like this one, vognetwork.com slash Discord.

47:22.000 --> 47:31.000
I was seeing that there's been a lot of advancement in Switch Homebrew this week, and there was a full, I didn't get a chance to watch that whole YouTube, so that's why I didn't want to bring it up totally on the show tonight.

47:31.000 --> 47:37.000
But they have made some much bigger strides in getting Homebrew to actually work on the Switch this week.

47:37.000 --> 47:45.000
You know, so even though you say that very tongue in cheek, oh, they'll just put it back? Well, we're getting closer to that being a reality, really.

47:45.000 --> 47:46.000
Yeah.

47:46.000 --> 47:47.000
Yeah.

47:48.000 --> 47:49.000
Anyway.

47:50.000 --> 47:55.000
Let's see, so Bobby found the whole little explanation he wanted to copy paste here, saying,

47:55.000 --> 48:06.000
It's because the Flog was intended to be a omamori for Iwata or an amulet asking for a blessing. You don't open an omamori or else you lose its blessing.

48:06.000 --> 48:13.000
When people found the Golf Iwata tribute, they opened the omamori. Omamori are replaced yearly, traditionally.

48:13.000 --> 48:17.000
Oh, interesting, so maybe there's a new one in there. No, that might be taking it too far.

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
They don't make a way to open it.

48:19.000 --> 48:28.000
And that's the thing, I get it, I totally respect that, I understand that, but did you think you were gonna sneak a game in the hardware and somebody wouldn't find it?

48:28.000 --> 48:32.000
Like, again, hackers gonna hack, right? So, like, it was gonna get opened.

48:32.000 --> 48:33.000
Yeah.

48:33.000 --> 48:42.000
We'll see. It'll be interesting to see maybe if Golf ends up on this whole Nintendo thing that's coming in the next year or what they do there, but...

48:42.000 --> 48:52.000
It could be. It could be on their online service, and since we'll never be able to open it because it'll never come out, the tradition lives on.

48:52.000 --> 48:53.000
Now you're being mean.

48:53.000 --> 48:54.000
Alright.

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
I'm just being realistic.

48:56.000 --> 49:00.000
Alright, let's talk about some Sega hardware. Woohoo! We like Sega.

49:00.000 --> 49:06.000
Since, you know, a lot of people are talking about, you know, SNES Classic and all that stuff this holiday season, let's talk about Sega hardware.

49:06.000 --> 49:20.000
Well, there are some new systems coming out, not like a brand new Sega system, don't get too excited, but apparently this is the Retro-Bit Micro console, the folks that make the Retro-Bit console.

49:21.000 --> 49:31.000
They are teaming up with Sega to do new products based on the Mega Drive or Genesis, the Saturn, and the Dreamcast. Yeah, that could be awesome.

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
So we might actually see Dreamcast games on one of these.

49:33.000 --> 49:39.000
Yeah, because I could care less about the Sega, Genesis, or the Mega Drive because those have been out forever.

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
That's true. They have re-released those in boxes.

49:41.000 --> 49:48.000
Several times, and they're trying to get in on that, that we, the NES and SNES Classic mini money.

49:48.000 --> 49:51.000
Actually, nah, those Genesis things were out before that.

49:51.000 --> 49:54.000
Right, exactly, but now they're trying to get in on that.

49:54.000 --> 49:55.000
Okay, that's fair.

49:55.000 --> 49:58.000
They're trying to figure out, but like, Dreamcast and Saturn, yeah, maybe I'm bored with that.

49:58.000 --> 50:04.000
Yeah, oh yeah, for sure. I think especially with Dreamcast, especially, oh my gosh, if I could play Phantasy Star online again, I'd be so happy.

50:04.000 --> 50:11.000
I'm not gonna go that far to expect that that'll be there. I think it'll be stuff more like, you know, Crazy Taxi, and I don't care.

50:11.000 --> 50:15.000
You know, Space Channel 5, hey, I'm in for that, why not?

50:16.000 --> 50:23.000
Anyway, so, Retro-Bit is promising to retain the original formats, but also doing upgrades like USB and Bluetooth.

50:23.000 --> 50:27.000
Apparently, CES 2018, which is, what, it's only about a week away.

50:27.000 --> 50:28.000
A few weeks away.

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
Yeah, it's the first weekend in January, I think.

50:30.000 --> 50:35.000
We're gonna see more about this. They're saying they will tease that there, so that'll be very cool.

50:35.000 --> 50:42.000
So, maybe, maybe next year's big thing will be the Dreamcast mini. Who knows? We can dream.

50:42.000 --> 50:49.000
But, I mean, the thing with those retro Sega Genesises and the Atari flashbacks and stuff is that you could really find those really easy.

50:49.000 --> 50:56.000
They certainly don't have a, in fact, with the flashbacks, I think they might make too many of those, because I usually see those on sale at some point.

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
Yeah, they're all over the place.

50:58.000 --> 51:03.000
Yeah, they are, so. Alright, one more story for you, and then we're gonna get to the classic game of the week. Loki.

51:03.000 --> 51:12.000
So, Universal Studios keeps putting out all these different rides based on video games, so now Universal Studios Japan is finally getting a Final Fantasy ride.

51:12.000 --> 51:24.000
And, I guess they said, starting January 19th, the Final Fantasy is getting a roller coaster at Universal Studios Japan called Final Fantasy XR Ride.

51:24.000 --> 51:35.000
It's a limited time ride, part of, I guess, their Cool Japan event. And, it'll be a VR-enabled roller coaster.

51:38.000 --> 51:47.000
Pretty neat. And, I guess it's gonna end its run on June 24th. But, they have pictures of Sephiroth.

51:47.000 --> 51:55.000
I think it's supposed to be a bunch of the different Final Fantasy games you travel through, because I guess Lightning's in it too, and some of the other characters.

51:55.000 --> 51:58.000
So, I guess you travel from one fantasy to another.

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
This is the roller coaster.

52:00.000 --> 52:03.000
Well, we have that release on PS4 coming up, so maybe.

52:03.000 --> 52:08.000
Am I gonna go down a big hill and then run through Aerith as I go?

52:08.000 --> 52:09.000
One can hope.

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
Like, it's the total Sephiroth simulator there?

52:12.000 --> 52:18.000
We won't know until people ride the ride. But, that is interesting. It's an interesting way to do it, especially with the whole VR coaster.

52:18.000 --> 52:23.000
I haven't been on one yet here, but I know they just put one in at the nearby Six Flags...

52:23.000 --> 52:26.000
They still call it Six Flags Marine World. What the hell is it called now?

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
I'm so old and I'm cool.

52:28.000 --> 52:29.000
Animal Kingdom or something?

52:29.000 --> 52:32.000
Whatever it is. The one in Vallejo. Or, as I like to say, Valley Joe.

52:32.000 --> 52:36.000
The one in Vallejo has a VR coaster they just put in.

52:37.000 --> 52:40.000
The thing about that is, okay, cool, you can do the VR stuff.

52:40.000 --> 52:46.000
But, because a lot of that is also software-based, it's not like you're having to lay all this new track.

52:46.000 --> 52:50.000
You can kind of generate a new... I make it sound like, oh, you just do it overnight.

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
Obviously, no. It takes a team of graphics programmers.

52:52.000 --> 52:59.000
But, probably still less people than it would to actually go out there and lay a new track to do a new coaster and tear the old one down.

52:59.000 --> 53:03.000
Yeah, because they have all the motion data already in there and they're just re-skinning it, which is kind of cool.

53:04.000 --> 53:05.000
Yeah.

53:05.000 --> 53:10.000
Looking in chat, Bobby Blackwolf says, Six Flags Over Georgia has a VR coaster.

53:10.000 --> 53:13.000
It's a regular coaster, but you can opt to wear a Gear VR.

53:13.000 --> 53:17.000
Yeah, I think that's kind of what the Six Flags thing here is, too.

53:17.000 --> 53:18.000
So, maybe they put them in a lot of different ones.

53:18.000 --> 53:26.000
It looks cool. I mean, they've got them fighting and Seth Roth looking into this Japanese woman's eyes very lovingly as he murders...

53:26.000 --> 53:30.000
Oh, and Chocobos. That was short. That was 15 seconds.

53:30.000 --> 53:39.000
Well, I'm curious to see what this looks like and, you know, what they might kind of rotate in and out at different places.

53:39.000 --> 53:42.000
I would like to see if it would come to Universal Studios over here as well.

53:42.000 --> 53:45.000
It's all about Mario Kart VR whenever that comes out.

53:45.000 --> 53:48.000
Well, Mario Land's going to be a real thing.

53:48.000 --> 53:49.000
I know. I won't play that.

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
Or Super Nintendo World, whatever they're calling it.

53:51.000 --> 53:56.000
Anyway, we're going to take a trip to old school land right now.

53:56.000 --> 53:59.000
I'm going to say what we call the classic game of the week.

53:59.000 --> 54:06.000
Every week, Dark Soccer jumps into the gaming vault, finds a game that she thinks, hey, you brats should check this game out and do this.

54:06.000 --> 54:15.000
So, we're actually going to get her on the line right now through the magic of the telephone so Dark Soccer can actually tell us the classic game of the week.

54:15.000 --> 54:18.000
And hopefully, she doesn't ignore the call because it's a weird number.

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
Oh, I think we have her there. Hi, Jamie. You there?

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
Yeah, I am.

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
Hi. Welcome to the show.

54:24.000 --> 54:25.000
Hi.

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
Hi. Good to hear from you. I hope you're doing well.

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
Um, okay.

54:29.000 --> 54:35.000
Yeah, alright. Are you sure you're good to do this segment tonight? You sound a little like you want to go back to bed.

54:35.000 --> 54:42.000
Well, you know what? I was in bed and everyone kept waking me up with text messages.

54:42.000 --> 54:43.000
Oh.

54:43.000 --> 54:49.000
So, I just got up and I'm a little bit on coding right now.

54:50.000 --> 54:56.000
So, we get to spend the last classic game of 2017 on drugs. Hooray.

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
Yay. Don't do drugs, kids.

54:58.000 --> 55:02.000
How appropriate considering what's happening here tomorrow in California.

55:02.000 --> 55:08.000
If you haven't already heard, a proposition that was passed a year or two ago is finally taking effect.

55:08.000 --> 55:12.000
Oops, that was supposed to be your classic game.

55:12.000 --> 55:13.000
I think it's just...

55:13.000 --> 55:14.000
It's your classic commercial?

55:14.000 --> 55:18.000
Classic commercial because I was an idiot and didn't have a password. Sorry about that.

55:18.000 --> 55:19.000
What were you going to say, Jamie?

55:19.000 --> 55:22.000
I think I'm just going to grow some bud in my backyard just because I can.

55:22.000 --> 55:23.000
Just because you can.

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
It'll grow in my fairy garden.

55:25.000 --> 55:30.000
So, Jamie, one thing I did not mention, I did see an article regarding it, though.

55:30.000 --> 55:38.000
But they have, and I haven't downloaded it yet, because I just found out about it yesterday, but they have a VR Danganronpa thing.

55:38.000 --> 55:43.000
They've had a VR Danganronpa thing for a while.

55:43.000 --> 55:47.000
Oh, since I have you on the line, I was going to wait until you were back in studio to do this.

55:47.000 --> 55:50.000
But you did send them to me in a message, so maybe you do want to get it out there tonight.

55:50.000 --> 55:56.000
Before we get to the classic game of the week, would you like to share quickly your favorite game of 2017 and why?

55:56.000 --> 56:01.000
Well, I have the top three, but one of them is really more favorite than the others.

56:01.000 --> 56:02.000
Okay.

56:02.000 --> 56:13.000
So, I would say that Breath of the Wild is my game, because we've already played through it on Wii U, and then I won the Switch at work.

56:13.000 --> 56:20.000
So, we're playing through it again, and we've got all these Amiibo cards that I bought on Amazon.

56:20.000 --> 56:27.000
So, we're trying to get all of the special goodies from the other games, and it's really fun.

56:27.000 --> 56:35.000
It's revitalized our love for the series, so that's been getting more attention from me, I think,

56:35.000 --> 56:39.000
except the fact that I've been going back and playing Dragon Age Inquisition a lot.

56:39.000 --> 56:48.000
I'd also like to give the honorable mentions to Danganronpa Z3, even though I haven't gotten very far in it, because it's Danganronpa.

56:48.000 --> 56:55.000
What else came out this year? Mass Effect Andromeda? I think it came out this year?

56:55.000 --> 56:58.000
Yeah, it did. You had that on your list you sent to me.

56:58.000 --> 57:11.000
Yeah, I played it a good bit. I really like the Legion WoW expansion, to be honest, although right now I don't have enough stability to play it right now.

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
That's fair. Codeine, it's fun.

57:13.000 --> 57:18.000
But I like floating around and breaking old dungeons with my Demon Hunter. That's pretty fun.

57:18.000 --> 57:19.000
There you go.

57:19.000 --> 57:32.000
And I really do like, as far as IOS releases, I really do like the Animal Crossing Pocket Camp. That one's pretty fun.

57:32.000 --> 57:38.000
I really enjoyed it, and I really play a good bit of it every day.

57:38.000 --> 57:41.000
I have to be honest, I kind of gave up on that. Is there still a lot to do in that?

57:42.000 --> 57:51.000
Oh yeah, they put out the flowers, and you can crossbreed your plants, and I'm trying to have a garden of nothing but black tulips, like my soul.

57:51.000 --> 57:59.000
Fair enough. Well, let's get to the Classic Game of the Week for this week, which has nothing to do with any of these games we've talked about.

57:59.000 --> 58:04.000
It does have to do with the classic system that I brought up over this year.

58:04.000 --> 58:05.000
Okay, so here it is.

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
The first game out on that system.

58:07.000 --> 58:12.000
The final Classic Game of 2017, bringing it full circle. What is your pick tonight, Arasaka?

58:12.000 --> 58:17.000
It's Asuka 120% Burning Fest.

58:20.000 --> 58:25.000
Which I think is a lot of cutscenes. A lot of long, extended segments. You're going to hear a little talking in the background here.

58:25.000 --> 58:28.000
You can skip up into the fighting part of things.

58:28.000 --> 58:31.000
Okay, if I can find one of the fighting parts here. Let me see.

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
Maybe ten minutes.

58:33.000 --> 58:40.000
Yeah, I was like, this is a long intro. Oh wait, here's some fighting. Hold on, let me skip ahead to here.

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
There we go.

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
Okay.

58:44.000 --> 58:49.000
But I would appreciate if you could turn it down a little bit, because I can't hear myself talk.

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
Oh, sorry.

58:51.000 --> 59:03.000
Okay. Anyway, Asuka 120% Burning Fest was produced by Fill In Cafe and distributed by Family Soft in Kodansha.

59:03.000 --> 59:14.000
It was actually programmed and designed by Imazumi Masatoshi, who also did a little game called Tanser Bandit.

59:14.000 --> 59:20.000
Which, if anyone knows Tanser Bandit, it was reskinned as Tandemonium.

59:20.000 --> 59:24.000
So, we've got a little bit of a Playstation link here.

59:24.000 --> 59:30.000
It actually had some pretty good talent behind the design.

59:30.000 --> 59:42.000
Manga artist, Alina Nase did the character designs, and she also did the Samurai Spirits 2 anime designs.

59:42.000 --> 59:50.000
And a few other manga and games, so really good artists.

59:50.000 --> 01:00:00.000
And then the music was done by Youmao Keishi, who did actually a good number of games for Terra Fantavica,

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Paradise Lost, Mad Stalker, quite a few games.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:11.000
So, we've got a really talented sound designer.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:17.000
But anyway, the game itself came out on the FM Challenge.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:22.000
So, that's why it went back to one of the classic games.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:28.000
And it was released initially on March 11, 1994.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.000
The series only came out in Japan.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.000
But it had many iterations of the time.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.000
I'm not even saying it's all that great of a game, it's an all-female fighting game.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Where it's set at the Ryōran Private School.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Where it's all for young girls from the upper edges of society.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:55.000
And they have a martial arts tournament called the Club Rivalry Budget Contest Mega Fight.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Yeah, I'd sign up for that.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:02.000
But it's an all-digital game.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:08.000
So, there was a version released that had voice acting and dubbing,

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.000
which I think that's the version I've linked to the video.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:17.000
It's Asuka 120% Special Burning Fest on PlayStation in 1996.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:22.000
And then it had a couple of other releases later.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:31.000
It was updated and released as Asuka 120% Excellent Burning Fest in 1997.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:36.000
And then Asuka 120% Limited Burning Fest for Sega Saturn.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:40.000
That's much better graphics and changes to the characters.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:51.000
And then there was finally a 1999 release that was Asuka 120% Final Burning Fest.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:56.000
And then there were other releases on PC.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:02.000
It had Return Burning Fest, and then another Final Burning Fest on PlayStation,

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
which was part of the Super Life 1500 series.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:10.000
And Limit Over Burning Fest, that was an unofficial release on Sega Saturn.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
It came out in 1998.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:16.000
But one of the other notable things about this game is that

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:24.000
basically, Fill-In Cafe was just two full-time programmers.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:28.000
And they basically went on to treasure.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:33.000
So, some of the games that they developed,

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:37.000
they were also behind Mad Stalker on the X68000,

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:48.000
and Makenna Makenna 2, Kimero Yokai Sori for PlayStation before Fill-In Cafe went bankrupt.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:52.000
So we have our treasure link here as well.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:59.000
But for a game that's only got six characters, it certainly did have quite the following.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:04.000
The website actually is still up and running, the Japanese website.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:12.000
It's Asuka 120% Burning Room, and you can go check out characters and look up stuff on them there.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:15.000
You know, there's character models and whatnot.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:25.000
But really, this is, I mean, it was kind of one of those niche games that fans either love or hate.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Like I said, it's not the most solid fighting game out there,

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:36.000
but it is one of the ones that began its life on the FM Towns,

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:41.000
and we got much wider releases later, and they kept updating and updating it.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:45.000
So, there you go, Asuka 120% Burning Fest.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Alright, kind of bringing it full circle with the FM Towns from earlier this year and the classic system and all that.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:57.000
There it is, your classic game of the week, Asuka 120% Burning Fest.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Eleven versions of the game.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Yeah, the noises you were hearing were from the Sega Saturn version of the game, just to clarify,

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.000
because I think you said it was the PlayStation in there, but that was the Sega Saturn version,

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:11.000
which was probably the one you had, if any of them, I'm assuming.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:15.000
I think I've got it somewhere in the pile.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:22.000
But I mean, it was always that game that whenever I went to import shops, it was always everywhere.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:27.000
I mean, it's about, I'd say, a fairly common game.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:30.000
You know, at least in my experience it was.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.000
People might have a little bit more trouble finding it now.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:39.000
I mean, if we look on eBay, I'm sure we could find a couple copies for various things.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Alright. Well, Jamie, feel better, and we hope to see you here next week,

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
but if it's a couple weeks, then it's a couple weeks.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
But we'll see you soon, I hope.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:56.000
By the way, if you did want it on Saturn, the most expensive one I found is 27 bucks.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Oh, that's not that bad.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Yeah, it's really cheap. However, the game is...

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:06.000
There's other games you could spend the money on.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Well, the Sharp X68000 version is 200 bucks, but then again, it is the Sharp X68000.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Yeah, that's gonna be a little harder console to find, so...

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Alright. Well, I'm gonna let you go, Jamie. Enjoy the drugs.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Oh, yeah, I've been enjoying them a lot. Thank you.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Alright.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Hopefully it will make me not give a crap about how 2018 starts.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Alright, well take care and feel better.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Thank you. Bye.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Alright, always good to hear from Dark Sakura here on the show.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
We are gonna take a quick break, though, but don't go anywhere.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:44.000
We've got more Orange Launch Radio to come, including some rapid-fire news.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.000
I don't know if we have mail tonight, but we'll log in and find out.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:50.000
And some other gaming news, and then we'll open the Skype line.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:54.000
I don't know if anyone's gonna call us, but we'll open the Skype line and see if we get anything.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:58.000
And then that'll probably wrap it up here on this special New Year's Eve edition,

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
because we didn't want to go two weeks with no show.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
So, you know, because we've done that already too much this year.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
It's been a year.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:08.000
So, a little special edition of Orange Launch Radio here to close out the year.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:12.000
We'll be right back after this break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Live today, December 31st, New Year's Eve, with a special edition of our show

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.000
that's taping a little bit earlier in the day here.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Loki is joining me here in studio.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Dark Sakura just was on the phone with us, but is no longer here.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
So, yes, Loki?

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:43.000
So, yeah. So, I bribed my son into coming in here to talk to us a little bit.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.000
Okay. Amazing. I don't know how you did that, but congrats.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Power of Slurpees.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
All right. So, can we say hello?

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Pick up that mic and say hi to our listeners that are out there, if you don't mind.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
How's it going?

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Good.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Good, yeah. You've been playing Super Mario Odyssey in the other room, right?

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Yeah.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Do you like that game?

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Yes.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Why do you like Super Mario Odyssey? What is it about that game?

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Well, so, it's just like you can throw the hat and you can turn into stuff. It's fun to do it.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
When you're like throwing the hat and stuff, it's really cool?

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Yeah, you can like throw it on them and then you can like throw it on stuff and then you can like turn into it.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:30.000
What's your favorite like thing to throw a hat at?

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Frog, because you can jump high.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Frogs are pretty cool, but don't bring them in the house.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Yeah.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Yeah.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.000
So, you play a lot of, what was it, Roblox?

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Yeah, Roblox.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.000
So, in Roblox, what's your favorite game to play on that one?

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Or what is Roblox, first off?

01:07:49.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Well, Roblox is like a game where you can like make your own character, but you need to, some stuff like you need to use with Roblox, which you buy with real money.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Oh boy, I bet Dad loves that.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:09.000
And then, and then you use it to like buy stuff in the game.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Like VIP-ers?

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Yeah, like VIP.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:16.000
So, I've seen you play like different like simulator games in there, like they have like a prison-

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Subway simulator.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Subway simulator, so is that like a subway like the train or a subway like the restaurant?

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
A subway to the train.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Oh, okay.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Not the restaurant, because then I would just go in there and buy like a thousand million sandwiches.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:40.000
And then I've seen you do one like, was it like a cake or something? Was it like a cake one where you make cakes or something and then you were killing somebody?

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.000
I don't remember how-

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
What? I wasn't killing anybody?

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.000
No.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.000
With a cake? That seems-

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.000
If they have like-

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.000
What a delicious death.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:52.000
I don't know, he had like simulators and stuff where he'll go and attack people like for money or something, I don't remember.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:09:01.000
Well, there's some stuff where you need to like attack people and then you need to like evolve.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:05.000
And then you play a lot of Wii U stuff, so what are your favorite games to play on Wii U?

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
Legend of Zelda.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Legend of Zelda.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:12.000
The Breath of the Wild? The new one?

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Both.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Both, and you got Wind Waker?

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Yeah, I only have those two.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Cool.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:25.000
What's your favorite thing to do in Zelda Breath of the Wild? Do you like to just run around or do you like to ride a horse or what do you like to do?

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
I like to throw in the bombs.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Do you like to use the bombs?

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:35.000
Come on, Nolgus wants to ask. Ask him if Loki steals his Legos. Do I steal your Legos?

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Do I steal your Legos?

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Kind of.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Kind of.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.000
Kind of.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:49.000
If you don't steal his Legos, I suggest he completes his Lego sets in a shorter period of time than three months.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:54.000
I did hear that the presence of Dark Soccer and I got you, he ended up getting to use a lot, so.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Yes, yes. My youngest son Danny got the Lego Batman.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Lego Batman.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:11.000
The Brickhead and then they got the Domino Rally, which we haven't, well we opened up the other day and my youngest son wants to take it out and spread it all over the floor and I'm like, no.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Let's not do that. I think he wanted, he thought that there was like cars in there and he wanted to play with the cars is what he wanted.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Oh.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:20.000
So we did that.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:28.000
I'm looking at our chat. Tigerclaw on chat says, does Loki, your dad, stay true to his name? Is he a trickster around the house?

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.000
What?

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Are you a trickster?

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Do I trick you a lot?

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
Does he like to do pranks? Does he trick you?

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:42.000
He sometimes tricks me, like that time on the field trip where you said the head's gonna eat you if you get close.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.000
What?

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:50.000
Remember you said the head was gonna eat you when I get close and you're tricking me.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:51.000
I don't remember that.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:54.000
It's probably something adults lie about to make kids behave.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:02.000
You just have to understand, one thing you learn as you're a parent is there's a certain age where kids will believe anything that you tell them and it's fun just to kind of mess with that.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.000
And so.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Okay.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
When I'm an adult, I'm gonna do that.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
Yes you will and you'll learn the joy that.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Do you.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:16.000
One more question here from one of our listeners, Bobby Blackwolf, who asks, who completes things they build first? Josh or Loki?

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:23.000
He is referring to the fact that I've not finished my game.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Yeah, you've never finished your game.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Yes.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:28.000
All your games.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
Yes, that's correct.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Yeah, drag him.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:33.000
All right.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Well, technically he hasn't finished most of his Lego sets either, so we're tied.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.000
Only two.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Only two.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:44.000
Well, two that you've started, you still have one that's in a box.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
I can now see the resemblance here.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.000
I'm screaming over here.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:52.000
All right, anything else we need to ask Josh about?

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
Did you want to plug your YouTube channel?

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.000
Wait, Josh has a YouTube channel?

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:56.000
He does have a YouTube channel.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.000
I didn't know that.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:07.000
I don't know if my wife wants a lot of people in the middle, but your YouTube channel, the one that you do with your, what is it, Josh and Danny music and games?

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:08.000
No.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
He doesn't want to plug his YouTube channel.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
All right, but it's a secret for now.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Yeah, I said in one year I put one video on.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.000
That's all right.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.000
I put one video on.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:22.000
That's why I asked your dad how many games he's published in a year.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:26.000
One of these days I'll publish something in a year.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:27.000
You'll have to be quiet.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
So enjoy it while you can now.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:34.000
No, but there's, uh, no, he plays the piano, so he does that.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:40.000
And, um, the only hardest part of my homework is my piano.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:48.000
And he likes, um, I kind of played the piano when I was about your age, except I played what was called the organ.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.000
I'm seven.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:50.000
You know an organ?

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.000
No.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.000
The organ's like two pianos.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:54.000
One's on top of the other.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.000
That's what I used to play.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Oh, yeah, I think that is.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:05.000
So, um, so yeah, he plays the piano, so he records some videos of him doing that, but he really looks up to Ryan's toy review.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
It's, it's a video.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Well, there's videos where, basically he does everything.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:19.000
They do like a lot of blogging and toy opening and stuff like that, but he's like one of the most insanely popular kids channels.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:25.000
He's like a multi-millionaire now because, yeah, from opening toys and doing stuff with your family.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.000
I like to open toys.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Exactly!

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.000
I like toys.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:31.000
Why am I not getting millions of dollars, you know?

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:34.000
Because you're not playing a YouTube channel of toys.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
Well, we need to do that.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
We just need to vlog all this stuff we do and open toys.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:43.000
That's why I made my, uh, my channel for toys.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:44.000
Your toys channel?

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.000
So I can be rich.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:50.000
I can't wait for your kid to make more money off YouTube than you've ever made off this show.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
It won't take long.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
It won't take long at all.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.000
Alright.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:00.000
But I'm, uh, I'm not gonna make huge, like, eggs.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.000
He doesn't want to do the big surprise eggs, I guess.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Yeah, they have, like, a bunch of toys that we don't get for toys.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:09.000
You gotta talk into the microphone, they can't hear you otherwise.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:10.000
I know.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Okay.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:12.000
Alright.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:16.000
Any final thoughts for the show?

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
You wanna go back to playing Super Mario Odyssey?

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Yes!

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Just say bye.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
Bye, bye!

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Alright.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:30.000
Josh, everybody, Loki's child, making his debut on the show.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
Give a round of applause, even though there's really nobody here.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Good job, Josh.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Alright.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:35.000
There you go.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:36.000
They're applauding out there.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Why don't you take your coat off?

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:38.000
You're probably hot.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:39.000
Alright.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:40.000
Alright, fine.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Go play Super Mario Odyssey.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
We've got some comments in chat here.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:46.000
Does Josh have any last minute stories?

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
Dungeon Buster says, Super Josh Odyssey.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.000
And Dark Tetsuya says, He's adorable.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:50.000
There you go.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Seal of approval from chat.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:52.000
Alright.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:53.000
Alright, thanks.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:54.000
Buy Josh a Switch.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Yes, he would probably like it if I got a Switch.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:59.000
And honestly, like, you should've heard before the show.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:02.000
Josh was like, Let's go after the show and buy one.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:05.000
I'm like, I can't, Mommy would get mad if I spent the time.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
Yeah, Mommy would get very mad, I think.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:08.000
Have the money on a Switch.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.000
Alright, let's get into some rapid fire news, Loki.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:15.000
Okay, so let's talk a little bit about PlayStation Plus in January.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:16.000
Actually getting some decent games.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:22.000
Deus Ex Mankind Divided is gonna be the free game as well as Batman the Telltale series.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:23.000
That's on PlayStation 4.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:28.000
PlayStation 3, you're getting Sacred 3 and The Book of Unwritten Tales 2.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:32.000
And then on the Vita, you're getting a couple cross-buy games as well for PlayStation 4,

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:37.000
which is Psycho-Pass mandatory happiness and Uncanny Valley.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:42.000
So Psycho-Pass, is that related to the Weird Al Yankovic album as well?

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:43.000
I wish.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
You know, that would be pretty cool.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:49.000
But hey, Deus Ex looks pretty cool, so hope I check those out.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:53.000
And those are free if you have PlayStation Plus, which you probably do if you have a PlayStation system.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Alright, and then last but not least, there is a ROM hack out there for Super Mario Land 2,

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:04.000
which adds color, because if you remember, it was a Game Boy game.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:10.000
And Game Boys were pretty much monochrome green back in the 90s.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:14.000
And so now this is actually like a Game Boy Color version of the game.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:17.000
And they even have it where you can dump it to a ROM and you can play it.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:21.000
And they'll even give you the error if you try to play it on a regular Game Boy,

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:24.000
where it says this is a Game Boy Color game.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:25.000
That's kind of neat.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Yeah, and it looks pretty nice looking, so you can check that out.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Has anyone tried to reverse dump that onto a cartridge to actually play it on Game Boy Color?

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.000
Yeah, they've done that.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:34.000
Oh, cool.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
You can actually dump that onto a cartridge, yeah.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Wow.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.000
Alright.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:46.000
Well, moving on to some other stories, let's talk about the upcoming Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:47.000
Some fans in Japan.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:53.000
So it's not just people in the US on Twitter that create sometimes a lot of controversy,

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:59.000
because it's even happening in Japan that they are very upset about some, well not everybody,

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:04.000
but some fans in Japan are upset about some of the decisions made for Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:08.000
This actually, it does kind of make sense though, like I actually get why they're mad.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:12.000
If you haven't heard, there's going to be 12 games in this 30th Anniversary edition,

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:17.000
which they announced a few weeks ago, including Street Fighter II, Street Fighter II Turbo,

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:20.000
3rd Strike, Street Fighter Alpha, et cetera, et cetera.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
But, here's the crazy part.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Since all titles contents are based on the overseas versions,

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:30.000
the titles, voicing, and text will be in English.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:37.000
So, meaning that the Street Fighter Alpha series, which was called Street Fighter Zero in Japan,

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:43.000
they're going to go with the English title names, and so they're basically not changing anything for Japan,

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:50.000
and I think that even means going so far as to, like, that the names of the characters are going to be all messed up,

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:53.000
because you know, over in Japan, what was it?

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:56.000
What we know as Balrog was...

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:57.000
Vega?

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
No, what we know as Balrog...

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:00.000
M. Bison?

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:05.000
How was it, yeah. M. Bison was that, and then Vega was the last boss, which we have as M. Bison,

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:10.000
and then the guy that climbs the walls, we have as Vega, but that was Balrog.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
So it's all messed up, right?

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:16.000
So that is, apparently none of that's getting changed for Japan.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:19.000
So it's kind of like, you get the 30th Anniversary Collection,

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:24.000
but we hope you enjoy the additions from the Americas, because that's what you're getting.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:30.000
So, Japanese fans are a little upset they're not taking the time to provide the Japanese versions.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
So, anyway.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Dartetsuya, interesting.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:38.000
That's why Ivo uses universal names for the characters.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:42.000
Boxer, Claw, Dictator. Interesting.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:43.000
Boxer, Claw, Dictator.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
Yeah, makes sense. Alright.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:56.000
So anyway, it works both ways around, I suppose, is that sometimes Japanese fans get upset about things not being localized over there either.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:01.000
Anyway, my last, or my next rapid-fire story won't load, but I'm going to try to do this from memory.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:05.000
They are re-releasing, I suppose, Catherine.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:10.000
You know that game, that was a big, kind of like, it was like a puzzle game, it was a little bit cultish.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:14.000
They are re-releasing that on the PlayStation 4 as what's called Catherine Full Body,

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:22.000
and I'm hearing it is kind of like a remaster of the first game, but it sounds like there might be some extra content there.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:27.000
It's kind of like New Game Plus, I suppose. They're going back and adding some new stuff to it.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Yeah, they're saying that basically this came out of Weekly Famitsu, so they've got, I guess, a profile for the third Catherine,

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:40.000
because if you remember from Catherine, there was two different Catharines that were in there, but now they're adding a third.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:48.000
And I guess along with that, there's, I don't know, they don't really talk too much about it.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:55.000
There's some streams that they're doing as well on YouTube and NicoNico, or they did those, I guess those were on the 22nd.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:20:01.000
And yeah, so it looks like it's just kind of an expanded version of the game.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:07.000
Yeah, so I kind of missed it the first time around, so maybe I'll get around to checking it out this time, we'll see.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:15.000
Yeah, just depends on price and time and all that good stuff, but I know the first game had its fans, so I'm sure some folks are excited to kind of see that come full circle.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:22.000
Alright, this is the part of the show where we talk about what's coming out in stores this week, but I think with the holidays, we're really empty,

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:27.000
so we're going to just kind of skip past that this week and get back into some releases next year, right?

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Do we have anything in early January? I know I'm kind of asking you a question about something you might not be prepared to answer.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:35.000
Why do we know Dissidia is a January title next year, right?

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Yeah, I don't know what they've got coming as far as 2018. They usually get some stuff in January, but it's not normally until the second or third week, usually.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:50.000
Let's take a quick peek here real fast.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Sorry to put you on the spot.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:21:03.000
No worries. January, the first release I show is actually on the 11th, so they have The Escapists 2 on the Nintendo Switch, followed by the 16th with Street Fighter V, the arcade edition.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
Oh, right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:12.000
So, yeah, there's Dissidia. I mean, just kind of going over some of the stuff. There's Dragon Ball FighterZ. Jamie will be very pleased with that.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:16.000
Dissidia Final Fantasy NT is going to be coming to the PlayStation 4 by the end of the month.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:21.000
And looking way ahead, February, they've got Civ VI Rise and Fall.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:29.000
Yeah, that's the expansion, yeah. It didn't make our show roll tonight, but they announced there's going to be another leader for India, I guess, in that expansion.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:48.000
So that it's not always Gandhi that's threatening to nuke you, which goes back to a bug in the classic Civilization game, where basically Gandhi was supposed to be so not like that that I think it subtracted two or something, and then that caused the odometer to roll over, so it actually set him on the ultra-highest setting.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:22:09.000
I'm like really crappily explaining this, but basically we'll say a math bug caused him to be the most extreme when it came to declaring war and bombing people, which obviously is not what Gandhi was, but it just kind of makes for a funny Civilization game, I suppose. It is just a video game, after all.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Yeah, Monster Hunter World, and then looking into February, they've got, what else have we got here? Looks like Metal Gear Survive.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
Oh god, I forgot all about that.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.000
The Bananas Switch releases.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
Yeah, I'm excited about that, so that'll be cool.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.000
There's lots of stuff coming.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:33.000
Well, this is a good chance for you guys to catch up on gaming backlogs, and if you're like me, I'm sure you have a ton of them.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Alright, we would usually do emails here as well, but our email bag's looking a little empty, so send us something for next year, would ya?

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Participate at orangelauntrader.com if you'd like to say hello, comment on any news story that we've been talking about.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:23:02.000
We get some really good insights sometimes from people that are like, hey, I work at XYZ Place, or hey, this game you guys didn't know much about, I played a lot of this game, so we always appreciate those insights, because there's only so many hours in a day, and we do all hold down day jobs too, so sometimes we can't get around to literally everything.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:07.000
Anyway, we will pick back up then with some other news. Loki.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:19.000
As I've been hinting throughout the show, Nintendo, their paid online service, which still hasn't released and has been delayed and delayed and delayed is now being delayed again.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:23.000
So now they're saying that it's been pushed back to fall of 2018.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:24.000
Wow.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:36.000
I mean, I don't know what this is, what is the holdup? Like really, what is the holdup at this point? It's like 19 months after the...

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:46.000
I would literally have to invent things, because we have no idea what it is, what they're working on, I can only think maybe performance issues, but I mean, that's not really being fair to anybody, it's just a guess.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:54.000
I mean, I hate making fun of Nintendo for being totally green and online, but...

01:23:54.000 --> 01:24:06.000
Well, here's the plus, there is a plus to this, you don't have to pay to play Splatoon online for another year potentially, so wasn't there something too about that this may only be impacting certain countries?

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:10.000
Because Nintendo hasn't officially said anything yet, right?

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:16.000
They haven't said anything, it originally was delayed this spring 2018, but they haven't really said too much about it.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:28.000
They're saying that apparently, this is according to Nintendo, the Italian Nintendo website, so Nintendo Italy is showing that it's been delayed to fall of 2018, so the assumption is well, it's a worldwide launch.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:31.000
And we know it may not necessarily be worldwide.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:38.000
I kinda don't understand why they'd hold it back in certain places only, especially a place like Italy, what did they do, you know?

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Like, what's special in an online capacity regard, what is special about Italy compared to say, the rest of Europe, you know?

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:52.000
Well, I don't know, so we don't know yet because they're quiet about it, so don't be surprised.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:25:03.000
Again, rumor, capital rumor, is that there's supposed to be a Nintendo Direct in early January, which would make sense because they're gonna start to detail some of the gaming releases.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:10.000
We know we have Bayonetta coming, but they're gonna really want to lay out, here's what to get hyped about in January, February, March, April, May, so it would make sense that they would do a Direct.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:21.000
And if they don't address it in the Direct, I think it's safe to say it's delayed, because if it was supposed to be debuting in early 2018, we would kinda hear something in this Direct, I would think.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:22.000
So...

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:37.000
Yeah, I'm just surprised. I mean, I don't know. I would've thought, it seems like if it's coming out like 19 months after a console's been released, that's like pretty poor planning. Like, you couldn't... I don't know.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:42.000
I'm trying to think, though, haven't? I mean, it's not like, well, yeah, I mean, it's online.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:43.000
This isn't...

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Yeah, it's not like a redesign of the dashboard or...

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:53.000
But this isn't like the first time they delayed. So I remember with the original Wii web browser and stuff, that was delayed as well after launch, and then you had to pay for it.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:26:00.000
And I don't know, back in that time period, jeez. But like, I'm just surprised.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:08.000
Okay, I knew there had to be some of this. Bobby Blackwolf points out Xbox Live didn't come out on the original Xbox for two years.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:09.000
But maybe...

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:12.000
But did they ever plan to have that at launch? Or was that like a...

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:19.000
Well, and I also kind of strike it up to one of those things where it's like, well, you don't know what you're missing until you have it.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:22.000
And that was the first. Xbox Live was kind of the first, right?

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:28.000
And so now, you know, at that point, those first two years of Xbox Live, you didn't know what you were missing until you had it.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:34.000
And now that's kind of where we're at with Nintendo. But it's not like you can play Splatoon Online.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:41.000
You do have that phone app, which, you know, it's not... I think everybody's kind of worked around with the voice chat.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:47.000
But it does provide that enhanced breakdown of your stats in Splatoon 2 and being able to see what's in the stores.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:51.000
I mean, it's a little something that wasn't there before. So it's not like there isn't anything at all.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:58.000
I think the big question mark is, what the heck is going on with Virtual Console and Online and that whole thing?

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:02.000
I think that's more of it. It's not like online play doesn't work. Look at Splatoon 2.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:06.000
And I know I keep going back to that one. That's the first thing that comes to my mind. Mario Kart is also online.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:09.000
You know, there are Nintendo games that perform online right now.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:17.000
It's just, we don't know what the extra stuff, which is namely, I guess, Virtual Console, we don't know what any of that's going to be.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:23.000
But then here's the other weird thing about Virtual Console and all that. I don't know if you know this, but over this holiday break,

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:31.000
I think it was just either like on Christmas Day or the day before, that versus Super Mario Brothers came out for Arcade Archives.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:39.000
So you can play kinda the original Super Mario Brothers on Nintendo Switch now. Kinda.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:45.000
But of course, that versus Super Mario Brothers, it was different. It was a little bit harder. There's some missing things.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:50.000
And then even when you get into it, like the warp zones don't all work. You can only go to level six.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:58.000
And then when you get that far in the game, like levels are straight up replaced with levels that are in Super Mario Brothers 2 Japan,

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:02.000
which is lost levels here, which as you remember, those levels were very hard.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:09.000
So anyway, so it's kind of like a mishmash of all these different elements of, I guess, the first two Mario Brothers games overseas.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:16.000
But anyway, the point is you can play Super Mario Brothers on the Switch kinda right now.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:21.000
So, but it won't be the same thing you guys remember. Anyway.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:27.000
All right. But Bobby does want to clarify the Ethernet port was there at launch.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:33.000
But was that intended for LAN? Because here's the thing is I remember that the Halo, the original Halo game was all like a...

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:36.000
Was the original Halo LAN? I thought it was.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:37.000
Yeah, it's the same link, yeah.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
Or was it Halo 2? Yeah, I think it was the original Halo.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:43.000
Because I remember, I'm trying to remember when I first got into Xbox.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:46.000
Remember, I've told this story before, I played it at a wedding.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:51.000
And the wedding reception they had, yes they did, they had Halo. Was it Halo or Halo 2?

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:52.000
They had it, but it was a local area network.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:53.000
I think they both did.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
Yeah. And that was when I got hooked on Halo.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:00.000
And I was like, I did not think I would enjoy a first person shooter, but this is so much fun. So.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:05.000
Anyway. And Bobby's clarified, yes, Halo 1 had LAN.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:08.000
I don't know, it's so long ago, I barely remember.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:09.000
It's been over 10 years.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:12.000
It has been a bit closer to 15 at this point.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
I know, totally classic game material.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:21.000
The original Xbox was before this show. I remember buying an Xbox the first or second year of the show.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:26.000
Because I finally got swayed by UltraMix. Remember we had that guy, he brought his Xbox to the show.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:30.000
What was his name, Ryan? Zero? Something like that was his name. Remember that guy?

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:31.000
Yeah, maybe.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:35.000
And he came and he brought his Xbox. And I was like, UltraMix is actually kind of rad.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:38.000
And then when UltraMix 2 happened, I had to have an Xbox.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:44.000
Because that was the best DDR game. And I still say to this day, the best home DDR game they ever did was UltraMix 2.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
Was that where they had the different drum stuff?

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:51.000
Yeah, that was when they started licensing the synth pop and it really started to go a different direction.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
And then they killed it.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:30:00.000
Yeah, unfortunately. Anyway. Let's move on. Did you want to talk about the chips too, while we're here?

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:10.000
Yeah, we can talk about the chips. So, they're also delaying the 64 gigabit or gigabyte chips. I'm assuming it's gigabyte chips.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:17.000
So, I guess originally they were supposed to be in the hands of developers already.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:21.000
But apparently now it's going to be coming out in 2019.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:30.000
And I guess one thing with that, from what I hear, is that a lot of people aren't using the 32 gigabyte ones that are already available.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:37.000
And so, right now a way developers have been kind of getting around it is just having a large download after the fact.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:41.000
Yeah, is this just a cost thing? This might be a stupid question.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:47.000
But I'm just assuming that a 32 gig cart costs more than a 16 or an 8 gig cart.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:54.000
And so, to make more money, they are using the smaller carts and doing the download.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:58.000
Yeah. Because it's your data that you can use.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:03.000
That's right. That's your 900 gigabytes that the Xbox is downloading in a month.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:07.000
Yeah. I don't know.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:15.000
Moving on. Let's talk about, again, these are rumors, but it's a slower show this week, so I'm allowing a few more rumors than usual.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:21.000
But it's a game that people get excited about. It's Pokemon and the upcoming Gen 8 game, which we know is for Switch.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:25.000
That part we know. Nintendo's confirmed that the next generation of Pokemon will be on Switch.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:29.000
And we kind of know that Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon were kind of the last on the 3DS.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:33.000
And could the game be going through some changes when it comes to the Switch?

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:37.000
Well, there's some information kind of leaking out there on the web.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:40.000
And, you know, again, take it with a grain of salt.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:46.000
But the Chinese localization team has apparently already finished translating the game script.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:49.000
There's not going to be any new mega evolutions introduced in the games.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:54.000
There will be Z-moves, and they use motion control to activate using the Joy-Cons.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:58.000
Now, all of this sounds like, okay, yeah, this could all be real.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:02.000
The central plot revolves around the conflict between tradition and innovation.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:07.000
Okay, sure. Region inspiration been rumored to be Spain or Italy.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:12.000
Which, okay, yeah, I mean, X and Y was kind of France inspired, if I remember right.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
And Sun and Moon was definitely Hawaii.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:18.000
And every Pokemon game has been inspired by a certain region.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
Which region did they say it was again?

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
Spain or Italy.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:28.000
Poor Italy. You know, getting a region in Pokemon, but not getting there, you know, online for the Switch.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
Yeah.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:36.000
Also, though, the biggest, probably, like, big piece that would be a huge change to the whole thing

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:39.000
is that apparently the battle system is getting simplified.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:42.000
That could be controversial, and that's the part where I kind of go,

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:45.000
I don't know. I don't know if everybody would be down for that.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:52.000
But it's going to be, I guess, similar to Digimon World, which seems like sacrilege, but whatever.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:59.000
And Pokken Tournament with more of a rock, scissors, paper type of attack, block, or grab.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:03.000
I don't, see, and I don't know if I'm, that doesn't really make sense to me.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:09.000
Because the typing is so important and is kind of the whole, like, rock, paper, scissors thing, right?

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:14.000
Like, water beats fire, grass beats water, fire beats grass, right?

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
Like, that's your rock, paper, scissors stuff.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:17.000
Yeah.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:23.000
So, I don't really understand why, and I get, I know that there is this whole system in Pokken and everything as well,

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:27.000
but, like, Pokken is also, like, a fast-paced type of game.

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:32.000
There's a lot going on, like, right now, and so it kind of had to have a different system,

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:37.000
but with the more traditional Pokemon games, they're more of, like, a role-playing game.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:40.000
So, I don't know, I don't know if this makes as much sense.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:43.000
I mean, I guess we'll see, but...

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:44.000
Yeah.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:48.000
I'm excited for Pokemon Gen 8, though. I really am excited to see it on the Switch,

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:53.000
and the fact that I can pick it up and take it with me and play it on the TV is going to be great.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:56.000
Like, I really wish I could have done that for some of the 3DS games.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
I probably would have been more into it if that was the case.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:02.000
So, go into our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:05.000
Act-F says, that works in Pokken.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
It's dumb to apply it to the regular games.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:10.000
Pokken is a fighting game. It needs the triangle system.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:14.000
Pokemon has way more going for it to have way oversimplified.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:18.000
Well, yeah, and in Pokken, you can't really, I don't think it does anyway.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:21.000
Correct me if I'm wrong, Act-F, but I don't think it does the whole

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:24.000
water beats fire beats, you know, that whole thing,

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:28.000
because it's a fighting game and you need the characters to be a little more equal.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:32.000
Like, you don't want one character to be stronger than another just because of the typing.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:35.000
In Pokken, it's different, so that's why they have this kind of different system.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
So, anyway.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
That's what I thought. Thank you, Act-F.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
Act-F agrees with me.

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:44.000
Alright, anyhow, let's move on. I know rumors are not the most fun stories,

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
but it's a slower time to hear.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:47.000
Let's talk more rumors!

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:48.000
Uh-oh.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
But this one has a little more substance to it, right?

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:54.000
Possibly. Hopefully it's not a faked screenshot, but apparently, allegedly,

01:34:54.000 --> 01:35:00.000
there was a PlayStation Network page that went live for Destiny 2's second expansion,

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:07.000
titled Gods of Mars, and it was also leaked onto Reddit with a few screenshots.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:11.000
They said that basically it talks about that the Guardian will be exploring

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:16.000
the frigid Vale of Mars, and will go up against, I guess,

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:22.000
Charlemagne, who imprisoned Rasputin after reawaking Mars,

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:27.000
and they are supposed to be freeing Rasputin and defeating Charlemagne.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:34.000
And they've got new story missions, new themed weapons armors, co-op,

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:38.000
co-op multiplayer arenas, new enemy factions and bosses,

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:41.000
and, of course, now it's supposed to be 20 bucks.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:44.000
Coming out March 2018.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
And I fell off that Destiny train so fast.

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:50.000
Like, I was really into it for like a week, and then I got distracted.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
And I think what hasn't helped is then they're like,

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
oh, this expansion came out and you've got to buy this expansion now

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:57.000
to kind of really see what else is in the game.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:00.000
And it's like, I barely, I think because I waited for the PC release,

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:03.000
I kind of screwed a lot of that up because the time between the PC release

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:07.000
and expansion was a lot less than, say, somebody who got it on PlayStation 4

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
or Xbox One in the expansion.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:13.000
So it was like, where did the time go with the first game?

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:14.000
Oh, well.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:17.000
Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Dungeon Buster says,

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:21.000
people are pretty upset with Destiny 2 right now, especially with the expansion.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:25.000
Yeah, I've heard that they've actually had to go in and do another patch for the game

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:29.000
because I guess, you know, end game content was getting pretty hosed by this expansion

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:32.000
and some of the people who hadn't bought it were getting really irritated.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:35.000
Well, yeah, they had it. It was content that was available already

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:39.000
and then they paywalled it, like, after it's been available for a while

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:45.000
behind the expansion because it was end game stuff, which was just like, what the hell?

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:48.000
And then they were messing with the XP gains.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:53.000
At least you can still play stuff like World of Warcraft if you don't have the expansions.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:58.000
You might have a lot harder of a time finding a party for the content you want to do,

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:01.000
but, you know, you can do it.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:06.000
I don't know. There's just been a whole lot of Destiny 2 backlash

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:10.000
and the whole, you know, Eververse thing is just not helping.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:13.000
Funny you bring that up because Dungeon Buster actually says in chat,

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:18.000
if you go to the official forums, there are pages of nothing but remove Eververse

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:21.000
because of the way they did the loot tables in the game, especially with the Cyrus.

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
Right, yeah, did you hear about their Christmas event that they did?

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:24.000
No, I didn't.

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:27.000
So they had a holiday event and, you know, whereas most holiday events in games,

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:31.000
you know, you go in there, they have Christmas themed loot boxes and all that stuff.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
Yeah, Heroes of the Storm is doing that right now.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:34.000
Yeah, so they made it impossible.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:35.000
I got a snowflake mount last night.

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:39.000
Nice. So they made it so that it was impossible to get all of the, you know,

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:42.000
basically to unlock most of the stuff in those loot boxes.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:48.000
They paywalled the stuff that they were giving out as part of the Christmas thing behind stuff.

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:52.000
So instead of giving out these things and having, you know, stuff that you could get,

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:55.000
you know, maybe incorporating that into the normal loot boxes.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:59.000
Like, you know, with Overwatch, you get, you know, holiday stuff themed within that.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:06.000
Well, in this, it was separate. You have to have certain engrams to unlock those holiday loot boxes.

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:14.000
It's just, it's so greedy. This is just a perfect example.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:17.000
I think it's going to come back to bite them all. I think it is. Anyway.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:21.000
All right. Well, hopefully this game won't have any special boxes or DLC.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:24.000
And again, we don't know what it's going to be.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:30.000
There is a teaser site that has come up for a new Space Invaders project in 2018,

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:35.000
which of course, what, like only like the biggest arcade game ever in Japan, right?

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:39.000
And certainly everybody here knows Space Invaders as well. It was hugely popular over here.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:44.000
But I think what's more, I mean, okay, Space Invaders is kind of an older game at this point.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:47.000
I'm not sure a lot of people get really into like the old, old Space Invaders,

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:52.000
but this game has been reinvented several times in pretty cool ways.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:56.000
Like Groove Coaster is kind of Space Invaders-y in a way.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:01.000
Like they use a lot of the same like art, but especially like I think of Space Invaders Extreme,

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
the one that was kind of like, it was on PSP, I think.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:04.000
Yeah.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:07.000
I think they did a version on Xbox Arcade and some of that.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:08.000
Yeah.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:11.000
But like with the techno music and stuff as you play, it was a really cool game.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
Like it was a really neat reinvention.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:17.000
And then what they had Arknoid versus Space Invaders not that long ago, and that was kind of fun too.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:20.000
So like they've been reinventing Space Invaders in some really cool ways.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
Oh, and the thing at the arcade.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:26.000
That's something I played during the break that I haven't talked about on the show yet.

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:31.000
Randomly, Shane and I went over to, you know, the place up in Rockland that has all the music games.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
So we went up there, it's like a place in Neon FM.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:37.000
And they have one of those giant, now it's Space Invaders, but it spits out tickets.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:40.000
But this thing is so colorful and bright and loud, right?

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:41.000
Have you seen these things?

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:42.000
No, I haven't.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:43.000
I'm surprised they didn't have one at Golf Land.

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
They may have, but I didn't walk around too much.

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:48.000
I literally went through, we just went upstairs and like didn't look at most of the games.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:52.000
I did see there was a Max 2 still there that it's sad.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:59.000
Well, anyway, this mystery project is between Taito, who owns Space Invaders, and Dekika Games.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:00.000
I hope I said that right.

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:04.000
And they say, if you've ever played a video game, then you likely have Taito to thank.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
It's been four, that's a little.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:11.000
But anyway, it's been 40 years since they've released their monumentally influential arcade title,

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:14.000
Space Invaders, an indisputable founding father of modern gaming.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:20.000
To celebrate this occasion, Taito and Dekika are bringing the invasion to Steam in 2018.

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:23.000
Stay tuned for more details at the beginning of the new year.

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:24.000
They're so humble about it.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
I know, right? They're so humble.

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:29.000
Maybe that's why they're going to Steam and not the Humble Bundle.

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:32.000
Anyway, I'm sure they'll sell it there too.

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
But yeah, so it'll be interesting to see what this is.

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:35.000
Yeah.

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:40.000
Yeah, probably going to be something that kind of just modernizes the shooter, kind of like Extreme.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
But I hope the soundtrack is cool.

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:47.000
Yeah, actdeftinchat says, Space Invaders Extreme 3, please.

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:54.000
Tigerclaw says, the game I'm thinking of, Space Invaders Frenzy from Raw Thrills.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:58.000
Who, Raw Thrills has been doing a lot of those reinvention games.

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
Aren't they the ones that are doing that Ninja Turtles arcade game too?

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:01.000
Yes.

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:02.000
Yeah, that whole thing. So they're doing a lot.

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
There it is. Yeah, this is it.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:07.000
You have to see where you sit down, you have like the thing you point, it's crazy.

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:10.000
I bet you maybe this is something like they're going to try to make on Steam.

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
I don't know, something that's maybe a little more like...

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
So you actually like shoot stuff?

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
Yeah, you actually shoot them with like a gun.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:17.000
Huh.

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:18.000
It's different, right?

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:23.000
That's the cool thing about these Space Invaders reimaginings is that many of them don't really stick to the old format.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
So, anyway.

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:26.000
Cool.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:29.000
Cool. Anyway, that's what I have to say about Space Invaders. Loki.

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:32.000
Alright, and then unfortunately some more bad news.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:47.000
The voice actor, Jim French, has passed away. He was better known for some of the games he did voice work for for Valve, including Left 4 Dead, Left 4 Dead 2, and even Half-Life 2.

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:51.000
So, he did play Bill, I guess, in the Left 4 Dead series.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:56.000
And in Half-Life 2, he played Father Grigori.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:03.000
And I guess he also does the voice of Elder Titan in Dota 2, and the fisherman in Half-Life 2, Lost Coast.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:11.000
And aside from that, he was also, you know, I guess a radio producer and a host for several years.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:20.000
He created a show called Imagination Theater, I guess in Seattle's KIRO station, and later in KIXI.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
So, he was 89 years old.

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:28.000
Well, that's a good age, but very sad to hear about that.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:36.000
Lastly, tonight, end 2017. I thought maybe a little bit of music game news would be fun here.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:37.000
Yes.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:42.000
I don't know if there's anybody out there who wants to call in, but just in case we have anybody again on this early day.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:50.000
If you do happen to be listening later in the evening at our usual time, you're hearing a rebroadcast because we did tape the show today at noon.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:54.000
It's almost 2 o'clock on the West Coast now to free up our evenings.

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:57.000
But if you are listening live at the earlier time, you can give us a call.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:00.000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
And you can say hello.

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
Otherwise, we'll probably be wrapping up soon.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
But I did want to end it here on this note.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:09.000
It's just kind of music game news, but a little iffy.

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:23.000
That is that MAME, the Multi Arcade Machine Emulator, controversial emulator, I'm sure, but it is worth reporting that MAME, the new version of MAME, will be supporting Beatmania.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:27.000
Certain versions, 2DX specifically. I think the five keys are already supported.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:28.000
Yeah.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:40.000
But it will now support Beatmania 2DX 4th style, 6th style, 7th style, 8th style, Substream, and that's the one with DDR 2nd club.

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:47.000
Some other games worth mentioning, King of Fighters 98, Knights of Valor 2, New Legend, San Francisco Rush.

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:48.000
Rock sweet.

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
Wow, I'm almost more excited about that.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:51.000
Yeah, exactly.

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
That game was awesome.

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:54.000
So there you go.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:44:02.000
So that's kind of neat. Again, a little bit controversial because those games still kind of exist in many arcades, but those are some older versions.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:12.000
And something to also think about, because it is an emulator, it's going to be a little slower, so your timing is going to really stink.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:16.000
And working doesn't necessarily mean working greater.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:29.000
What kind of specs do you need to run that kind of stuff? Because I remember trying to get Gauntlet Legends to work, you have to have a 4GHz processor or something ridiculous.

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:37.000
I used to do a lot more MAME than I do now, and usually they'd get released, but then they'd get optimized. It would take a little time, but they'd get faster.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:44.000
And also, I've been doing MAME prior to them supporting multi-processors as well, so it may be a lot better now, who knows.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:52.000
DarkTetsuya said, I played 2DX6 on it, it's still early, so there's some issues, but it still kind of works, but I figured you guys might appreciate this.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:58.000
No, of course, it's a good note, but I'm bummed for us to end on here in 2017.

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:02.000
Alright, I'm going to do another shoutout for calls and see if we get anything.

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:07.000
OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype if anyone wants to get out their final thoughts for 2017.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
So games we're anticipating playing in 2018?

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
The Bayonetta remakes.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:18.000
I want to play Dance Rush whenever that gets brought out here, because I know they're doing location testing still.

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:23.000
But if it ever comes out here, which, that stuff tends to make its way to Dave and Busters.

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:30.000
I feel like next year might be the year for Kingdom Hearts III, finally. Fingers and toes crossed.

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
What do you think about Final Fantasy VII?

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:38.000
I think one or the other's got to happen next year. Maybe next year will be the Final Fantasy VII remake, and then next...

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:41.000
But the Final Fantasy VII remake's supposed to be episodic, too.

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
So I guess the first episode of that.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
Yeah, maybe they'll both hit next year.

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:48.000
I wonder if Metroid's going to be the fourth quarter game.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:51.000
I think Metroid will probably be next year. I don't think they want to announce it.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:52.000
Smash Brothers, maybe?

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:53.000
Maybe.

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:59.000
Smash Brothers, I could see, is a game that they could wait to launch that online service for, because then it's like, you need to have this.

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:06.000
That could be, yeah. They'll probably put out a very powerful kind of game to go with that online service, that's for sure.

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:09.000
Supposed to. By then, it's probably not going to be all that hot.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:14.000
DungeonBuster in chat says, Bayonetta 2 is definitely on the list for me. Never got to play it.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:21.000
BobbyBlackWolf says, Final Fantasy VII Remake Episode 1 in December 2018. You don't think they'll aim for November?

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
Try to get the jump on...

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:30.000
I mean, I guess that stuff isn't as important as it used to be, but I would still think you'd try to get it out in November to get the jump on the holidays.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
But it's not like...

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
Is Crackdown going to come out finally?

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:37.000
I think so, yeah. Crackdown is a game to look forward to next year.

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
Well, it's supposed to come out this year, too.

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:42.000
Yeah. I always forget about the Microsoft stuff. I know that's horrible.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
But that's because they don't have anything.

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:45.000
Like, they used to have, like...

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
Sea Thieves looked interesting.

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
Oh, come on. No.

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:50.000
Wow.

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:53.000
No, no, they used to have, like, really big, like, releases.

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
Forza Horizon 4.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:56.000
And now...

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:57.000
Hey, we gotta call. We gotta call. Let's get to it.

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
Hi, you're on Orange Taunt's radio. Who's this?

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:00.000
Hey, this, Act F.

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
Hey, Act F. What's on your mind, buddy?

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:08.000
Well, first of all, I really like that you enjoyed the gift I sent you.

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:11.000
We did. In fact, they're pretty much almost all gone at this point.

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:16.000
But we went all over. Like, I think Alan took a box to, like, a gallery meeting.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
I don't know if Farzer's still at the house.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
I know my wife was hoarding them, so...

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:21.000
What, did she like them?

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
I don't know if she's eaten them yet.

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:26.000
Yeah, the hazelnut stuff's really good. I'm sure Jamie ate all hers, too.

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
So, yeah, they're good stuff.

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:31.000
So, thank you for sending enough that we could all kind of share.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:32.000
Hey, no problem.

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
Well, what's on your mind tonight?

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:47.000
Yeah, anyways, there's a bit of news in Mexico concerning video games, and it's not that great.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:48.000
Uh-oh.

01:47:49.000 --> 01:48:02.000
Basically, Mexico legislation just passed a law that has to regulate violent games.

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:03.000
Oh.

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:12.000
Yeah. And it's weird, because I'm not against it, because, well, yeah, we do have to regulate those things,

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:18.000
because you cannot sell, like, an M-rated game to a child and all that stuff.

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:22.000
We don't have, like, some... We use the ESRB, obviously.

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:23.000
Right.

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:26.000
But there's nothing that regulates it, so...

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:32.000
So, when we talk about regulating violent games, is it kind of like that law that the Supreme Court kind of flipped here?

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:39.000
In the U.S., the one that never really took place, where, like, a store can't even sell it without checking ID?

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:42.000
Or what do we mean when we say, like, regulating violent games?

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
Yeah, that's basically it.

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:52.000
You'll be ID'd if you want to buy an M-rated game, or a violent game.

01:48:52.000 --> 01:49:08.000
And that's the thing. The legislation says they're gonna make, like, a new rating system, which is, like, really stupid,

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:11.000
because we already use the ESRB.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:16.000
The ESRB, it's even in Spanish, so it's like, oh, I cannot read English.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:28.000
No, it's in Spanish, too, so it's, like, really dumb that we're gonna use another, or have another, like, rating system, since it already exists, and we can use that.

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:34.000
Yeah. What do you know? Do you know the why? Like, why is this all happening?

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:47.000
Basically, the reasoning they have, it's because, oh, there's way, the people playing video games right now, it has tripled in amount,

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:58.000
and the majority of people are between the ages of 12 and 18, supposedly, and which I really, really don't believe it,

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:11.000
because consoles here are so way, way too expensive for, like, a 14-year-old to get, so I really don't believe the numbers.

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:20.000
I do understand the reasoning. Again, I'm not really against it, but it's, like, really dumb. They didn't think it through.

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:24.000
Well, for those that agree with you that it's dumb, is there anything at this point that can be done about it?

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:34.000
You know, I know here in the US, again, not to get too political or what have you, but I don't think it's any secret that, like, this year has been really hard on a lot of people,

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:41.000
because, you know, they may not agree with everything that's going on within the government, and it's caused a lot more people to get involved with politics,

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:48.000
and involved in that whole process. Do you think, I mean, is there an option for people in Mexico? Is there a way to get involved?

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:55.000
Is there a Supreme Court type of thing? I really, you know, I don't know. What could be done at this point, Akdev?

01:50:55.000 --> 01:51:10.000
Well, it passed the House of Representatives, the equivalent of it, so it has to go through the Senate, and they can overturn it, or they can just say no, it cannot pass,

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:20.000
but at this point, I think it's gonna pass, even if people, like, start saying, oh, we don't want this, or can you modify it?

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:31.000
It's gonna be like, oh, it's gonna be there, and you cannot do anything about it. Mexican politics are, if you think the US politics are really, really...

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:40.000
I've heard, I've heard, yes. I've heard. Although, I do always get a kick out of what's-his-name, Vicente Fox, and his ramblings on Trump.

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:50.000
That's always a lot of fun, anyway. But, not to get too political. Well, Akdev, I'm sorry to hear that, you know, it may not be going so well, although there might be elements of that that you agree with,

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:58.000
but again, I would, even if it feels like there is no hope, I would encourage people to try to get involved with the political process. At least let the Senators know you disagree.

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:03.000
We do have elections, presidential elections this coming year, so yeah.

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:08.000
There you go, there's your way to have a say. Alright, my friend, well thank you for the update, I appreciate it, keep us posted, alright?

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:21.000
I especially want to know, like, ultimately what the impact is that it has on, like, going to actually buy a game, or if it kind of turns out that you, you know, decide maybe to get stuff from America and bring it in. Who knows? Who knows?

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:27.000
Yeah, most probably what I'm thinking is gonna happen, more people are gonna go digital here.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:32.000
Ahh. Because, yeah, you cannot wriggle your debt. That's pretty much, like,

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:38.000
Very good point. Yeah, that's a way easy workaround on that, and that's got your games digitally, so,

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:44.000
That's a very good point, just go digital. Alright, Akdev, thank you so much for your support, and have a happy new year, okay?

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
Hey, you too. Alright, thanks buddy.

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:47.000
Thanks.

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:56.000
Alright, I don't think we have any other calls coming in, so I'm gonna go ahead and close up the Skype line there, but if you do have a thought you want to get out, you can always email us.

01:52:56.000 --> 01:53:03.000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, and I think, do you have any last minute stories? I didn't ask.

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:04.000
No.

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:11.000
I figured as much. I figured it's probably time we wrap it up. I think, Josh is probably all done with Odyssey now. Did you get all the moons?

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:12.000
No.

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:13.000
No, okay.

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
I was just going through random.

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:18.000
He was just going through random. Don't forget to talk in the mic or the people can't hear you.

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:21.000
I was going through random.

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:22.000
Did you turn the mic off?

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:23.000
It's on, we can hear him.

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:24.000
Okay.

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:25.000
Go ahead, you were going through random.

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:29.000
I was going through random kingdoms.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:35.000
Just random kingdoms. That's what I do too. I just, you know, what do I feel like doing today? That's a good way to do it.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:41.000
Well, Josh, thank you for being here. Appreciate you being here. I know you didn't say a lot on the show, but we enjoyed hearing from you when we did.

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:47.000
So, we'll have you back in a couple years when you're ready to promote your YouTube channel, okay?

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:48.000
Alright.

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:49.000
Alright, sounds good.

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:50.000
Alright.

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:51.000
Yeah.

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:52.000
Yeah, good.

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:57.000
Alright, Loki, thanks as always for being here, my friend. Next year, year 16.

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:58.000
Yeah.

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:02.000
Old enough to drive here at Orange Lounge Radio. Play some games already.

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:03.000
I know.

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:04.000
Make a game already. Get on it.

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:05.000
I'll do it.

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:06.000
Alright, good job.

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:07.000
Any final thoughts?

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
Apparently our dryer's broken.

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:10.000
Woohoo!

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:13.000
So, fun never ends in 2017.

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
What a great start to the new year.

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:16.000
Your dryer broke?

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:17.000
Yes, our clothes dryer is broken.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:20.000
You know what that means? You're gonna have to hang up all your clothes to dry them.

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:23.000
No, it means you're gonna take them over to my mother-in-law's house to dry them.

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
Well, how did it break?

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
It just, it's like...

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000
Somebody took a ride in there.

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
It's like almost nine years old, so...

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:38.000
Alright, as always, I say, if you enjoy what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, please tell a friend or two about the show.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:43.000
Help us spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, if the voices are actually here to be heard.

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:47.000
Otherwise, my final thought is, bring on the new year.

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:51.000
2017, I am done with you. Goodbye.

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:55.000
And for this week, we're done with all of you out there in Radio Land.

01:54:55.000 --> 01:55:00.000
We'll see you in seven days, live back at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern.

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:01.000
Have a great night, everybody.

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:04.000
