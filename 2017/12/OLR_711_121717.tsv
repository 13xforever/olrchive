7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	21000	Tonight we bring you the holiday joy of hopefulness, eagerness, and maybe a little bit of bitterness too, for what changes have happened and what's to come.
21000	27000	Join us for the week's gaming news and another day off the advent calendar, starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	37000	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37000	47000	It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight, episode number 711, sorry, no free slurpees, for this December the 17th of 2017.
47000	56000	My name, Rob Roberts, you might know me on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E, joining me, as always, say hello, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
56000	58000	I need to get seven words out in the open.
58000	60000	Oh, is this going to be a George Carlin thing?
60000	62000	It's the new George Carlin thing.
62000	63000	Okay.
63000	72000	Because apparently number 45 dump has decided that people can't say these words, so we're getting into 1984 territory here.
72000	75000	Never one to shy away from political statements here on OLR.
75000	77000	Well, I call out garbage when garbage is there.
77000	78000	I understand, I understand.
78000	79000	So I'm going to say them now.
79000	80000	Please.
80000	88000	Fetus, diversity, vulnerable, entitlement, transgender, science-based, evidence-based.
88000	90000	Are these all things you got me for Christmas?
90000	93000	I got you a fetus. I found it in the dumpster.
93000	100000	Because our regulations now on women's bodies are so terrible that women have to go and use coat hangers.
100000	104000	Anyway, believe it or not, it's a show about video games once in a while.
104000	105000	Well, you kind of did walk into that one.
105000	106000	I guess I did.
106000	108000	Anyway, happy Hanukkah, for what it's worth.
108000	109000	Thank you.
109000	111000	Chag Sameach to you.
111000	112000	Good shoe tie.
112000	115000	That's actually like pretty much what you say on a holiday.
115000	116000	Is it? Okay.
116000	117000	Chag Sameach.
117000	124000	Now, but if I remember correctly, and I come from a place of I don't really know, so just educate me if I need to be educated.
124000	128000	But my understanding is that like Christmas is like a big freaking deal to the people who celebrate Christmas, right?
128000	129000	Yeah.
129000	134000	But Hanukkah is like, it's a deal, but like it's not the Jewish holiday.
134000	135000	That would be like Rosh Hashanah, right?
135000	138000	Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, those are the big ones.
138000	139000	Okay.
139000	142000	This is more like so kids have a thing to not feel left out.
142000	143000	Story time.
143000	144000	All right.
144000	149000	Back in the day, and see now I'm also going to say this, this is the only Jewish holiday that is not in Torah.
149000	150000	Okay.
150000	153000	It was actually in an apocryphal book called The Book of Maccabees.
153000	157000	So Christ lady, you're dumping politics and religion on me and having been five minutes in the show.
157000	166000	So basically, the temple had been taken over, made into a place of pagan worship and Maccabees got their, you know, shit together, took the temple back.
166000	167000	Quick version, right?
167000	169000	They only had enough oil for one night.
169000	170000	Right.
170000	174000	So they sent off for oil, but they made the oil last for eight nights.
174000	175000	And that's the miracle of Hanukkah.
175000	179000	Well, that's what you get for using Amazon these days because they never get their shit out on time.
179000	180000	Girl.
180000	189000	But anyway, and I like the meme going around and say the modern equivalence is having, you know, one hour left on what being 1% on your phone and having it last for eight days.
189000	191000	That is a miracle.
191000	193000	That's a very modern way to explore.
193000	195000	That's how you explain it to a millennial.
195000	199000	Put down the angry emails. I'm just being silly.
199000	206000	But the whole thing is that I'm sure Jewish kids felt left out that all of their little gentile friends were getting presents.
206000	213000	So now it's kind of like a back to school holiday where people get pencils and like shirts and socks.
213000	216000	Which you don't start to appreciate those things till later in life.
216000	217000	I like socks.
217000	221000	Like when I was younger, it was like, you know, socks and underwear, whatever.
221000	224000	But now that I'm, you know, more in my prime, I'm like, ooh, socks and underwear.
224000	233000	Dude, I get giddy every time Daiso has socks because the Daiso, okay, this is my non endorsed endorsement of Daiso.
233000	234000	Okay.
234000	238000	The pile socks they have at Daiso are fucking comfortable as hell.
238000	240000	I'm wearing my new pair with stars all over them.
240000	241000	They are pretty cute actually.
241000	245000	And they're thick and cushy and I tear up socks really easily.
245000	247000	And women's socks usually made like shit.
247000	248000	These are comfy.
248000	249000	I will sleep in these suckers.
249000	250000	All right.
250000	252000	So Daiso socks.
252000	253000	Anyway, let's move on.
253000	254000	Of course.
254000	255000	Tech master Loki as well.
255000	256000	Hello.
256000	257000	Hello.
257000	259000	Who is, who is downing a Slurpee here on the show?
259000	261000	Did you bring enough for the whole class?
261000	262000	No, of course you didn't.
262000	263000	All right.
263000	264000	That's all right.
264000	265000	But you did bring other gifts.
265000	266000	Can I open this?
266000	267000	Yay.
267000	268000	So it's a, it's a Christmas special.
268000	274000	So I know I'm hearing that in chat, some of you are tuning out OLR live to go watch a Christmas story live.
274000	275000	Come on.
275000	276000	You've seen that.
276000	279000	Well, you've seen technically it's based on the Broadway thing.
279000	280000	It's not.
280000	281000	Oh yeah.
281000	283000	So everybody's like, why would they remake the movie?
283000	286000	Well, they're technically doing the Broadway version, which wasn't around very long.
286000	290000	But anyway, my point is you could have T vote that and listen to this.
290000	291000	No, I'm just kidding.
291000	292000	Whatever you like what you like.
292000	293000	That's why we podcast this.
293000	296000	Cause Sunday nights don't work for everybody, but I am going to open this.
296000	297000	Okay.
297000	298000	Have our own Christmas story right now.
298000	299000	So I'm opening this.
299000	300000	What is, Ooh, is this like a puzzle?
300000	301000	What is this?
301000	305000	This is Ooh, what the hell?
305000	310000	And Oh, there's actually like, Oh, Loki's a good guy and puts the receipt on there.
310000	313000	Just in case I decide it's not for me.
313000	314000	Drop mix.
314000	316000	What the wait a minute.
316000	317000	I know this.
317000	319000	This was like a Kickstarter at one place.
319000	320000	The harmonics thing.
320000	321000	Right.
321000	322000	Oh rad.
322000	326000	And I have batteries for it too.
326000	327000	Cause I love batteries.
327000	329000	So tell me really quick.
329000	330000	Like I sort of remember the Kickstarter for this.
330000	332000	I don't know what the game's like.
332000	337000	I tried it at the store one time and he basically put cards down and it reads them and it makes
337000	338000	music.
338000	339000	Okay.
339000	340000	Somehow.
340000	341000	Yeah.
341000	344000	And they actually has music from a fallout boy.
344000	345000	Imagine dragons.
345000	347000	Oh, thank God.
347000	349000	There's a, this is a religious holiday after all.
349000	352000	There is Carly Rae Jepsen included in this as well.
352000	353000	Carly slay Jesus.
353000	354000	And I'm so happy.
354000	355000	All right.
355000	356000	That's great.
356000	357000	Fantastic.
357000	358000	Thank you, Loki.
358000	359000	That's very nice of you.
359000	360000	No problem.
360000	361000	All right.
361000	362000	Oh.
362000	363000	And now dark.
363000	364000	Oh fuck.
364000	365000	And I'm looking in chat at live.vognore.com.
366000	367000	This is Joe.
367000	368000	And her mat says drop mix is really cool.
368000	369000	Vid power says it's really well done.
369000	370000	That's awesome.
370000	371000	Yay.
371000	372000	Don't throw the bag away.
372000	373000	I have portal.
373000	379000	The uncooperative cake acquisition game with the steam code for portal two.
379000	384000	So if any friends would like to have a steam code for portal two and play with me.
384000	385000	Ooh, steam card.
385000	386000	Yay.
386000	387000	Thank you.
387000	389000	Now you can buy portal three J K J K.
389000	390000	They can't count.
390000	393000	Well, technically it's a new game because it's a board.
393000	394000	No, I love it.
395000	400000	It's very, uh, if you haven't seen the box for this, it's very like plain 1960s generic
400000	401000	box.
401000	406000	And it does say in like a very plain font portal cake acquisition game.
406000	407000	So that's great.
407000	408000	I love it.
408000	409000	Let me see what the ours look like.
409000	410000	Uh, aha.
410000	415000	We have some rather tightly kerned, um, uh, Helvetica.
415000	416000	Great.
416000	419000	And actually there are some games on my steam wishlist that this will come in handy for.
419000	421000	Loki, you bought me a game on steam as well.
421000	423000	Like as if this drop mix wasn't awesome enough.
423000	425000	What was the game you bought on steam and why did you pick this?
425000	428000	Um, we can actually get to video games at some point tonight.
428000	432000	It's called getting over it and it's because it's incredibly frustrating and it's a good
432000	436000	streaming game because, because it's fun to watch people play it cause it's incredibly
436000	437000	frustrating.
437000	441000	And I've been really, really slacking on my streaming, but I really, really am going to
441000	443000	try to get back into doing that regularly.
443000	445000	Just not tonight cause I have company visiting.
445000	448000	So, uh, welcome back to the show here at orange on trade.
448000	452000	Oh, he's been on the show like a bunch this year and he's back one more time for our last
452000	453000	live show of 2017.
453000	454000	Say hello to JD.
454000	455000	Hi.
455000	456000	Hi.
456000	457000	How are you?
457000	458000	I'm doing pretty good.
458000	459000	Yeah.
459000	460000	Great.
460000	461000	So we went on Pokemon adventures today.
461000	462000	You want to talk about that for a little bit?
462000	463000	Um, sure.
463000	466000	You've been playing more poke, like Pokemon go cause nobody plays it anymore.
466000	467000	Right?
467000	470000	I mean, I play it when I come to Sacramento.
470000	474000	You've been playing, you've been playing at home too, haven't you?
474000	479000	Cause some very nice guy gave you a clicker thing, his old clicker thing and you're playing
479000	480000	it more.
480000	481000	Right?
481000	482000	Yeah.
482000	483000	Yeah.
483000	485000	Um, but yeah, it's been good to get like the, the GPS credit for like walking around because
485000	489000	that was one of the biggest obstacles to me playing was like Pokemon go, like having it
489000	493000	in the foreground of my phone takes forever and I can't do anything else.
493000	496000	And so now I can like do other stuff on my phone.
496000	501000	That's really the best part of the Pokemon go Bluetooth devices, be it an official device
501000	502000	or something like that.
502000	503000	Yeah.
503000	504000	Yeah.
504000	505000	Yeah.
505000	506000	Yeah.
506000	511000	That's really the best part of the Pokemon go Bluetooth devices, be it an official plus
511000	513000	or a gotcha is the walking credit.
513000	514000	I really is the best.
514000	515000	Yeah.
515000	516000	So awesome.
516000	517000	Yes.
517000	518000	Star.
518000	519000	Sorry.
519000	521000	I actually use when I take a walk at work, I turn on Pokemon go on my Apple watch.
521000	522000	Oh yeah.
522000	524000	I always, depending on where I'm walking, I either play Pokemon go.
524000	527000	If it's not a place I can really play ingress or I play ingress.
527000	530000	If I intentionally drove to a park to pew, pew, pew laser beams.
530000	532000	And sometimes you do both at the same time.
532000	535000	I thankfully with the iPhone 10 I can kind of do both.
535000	539000	I can Bluetooth with Pokemon and I can pew pew laser beams with ingress.
539000	542000	So it just kind of depends on the situation.
542000	547000	So heaven forbid when Niantic launches that third game, Harry Potter wizards unite because
547000	551000	then I'm going to have to make some tough choices because luckily that Draconis go was
551000	554000	kind of choosing a house isn't hard enough.
554000	555000	Yeah, I know.
555000	556000	I know.
556000	557000	No, no.
557000	558000	That part's easy.
558000	559000	Slytherin for life.
559000	560000	Slytherin.
560000	561000	I'm easy.
561000	562000	I'm kind of torn between Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw.
562000	567000	When your favorite drag queen is Alaska, you're going to pick Slytherin, right?
567000	568000	Cause you already speak parcel tongue.
568000	569000	That's right.
569000	570000	Exactly.
570000	572000	And there's like only three listeners that are going to understand that.
572000	574000	I think that you're a cuddly, adorable Hufflepuff.
574000	579000	Another problem, see with playing Pokemon go recently is that we're just too extreme
579000	580000	for Pokemon go.
580000	581000	Yeah.
581000	582000	What the hell is that about?
582000	583000	It's extreme weather.
583000	584000	Oh my God.
584000	585000	There's clouds outside.
585000	589000	So right now here, our show is based in lovely Sacramento, California.
589000	591000	And right now you just brought up Pokemon go this moment.
591000	593000	We're getting an extreme weather alert.
593000	594000	Yes.
594000	599000	Extreme weather because it's chilly outside, like not cold, but kind of chilly.
599000	601000	And there's a few slight clouds.
601000	602000	So here's the thing.
602000	605000	Apparently that is tied to official weather alerts.
605000	607000	So when you see that extreme alert,
607000	610000	I just pull up the weather channel app or whatever weather channel thing you want
610000	611000	to use.
611000	614000	Boy, I just really plugged the weather channel, didn't I?
614000	615000	I guess I hope for a kickback.
615000	617000	But anyway, I see the alert and here's the thing.
617000	621000	There is an alert, a special weather statement until Monday, 6 AM.
621000	622000	So we're going to be locked.
622000	626000	Well, you're not locked out of Pokemon go, but no bonus, no bonus for you and
626000	627000	Pokemon go.
627000	628000	You want stardust?
628000	629000	You can't have it.
629000	632000	So no stardust and Pokemon go until Monday, 6 AM,
632000	634000	because here's the official notice.
634000	636000	Rain and lower elevation,
636000	639000	mountain snow late Tuesday night and Wednesday,
639000	643000	a weak storm system will move across the region Tuesday night and Wednesday.
644000	648000	This is a fucking alert for Tuesday and Wednesday about a weak ass storm
648000	649000	system.
649000	653000	It says in the did not say a weak storm system.
653000	654000	You know what I'm looking forward to?
654000	655000	What?
655000	658000	So I live in San Francisco in the summer.
658000	660000	Sometimes it gets a little warm for us.
660000	663000	So the national weather service will issue heat alerts when it gets to be
663000	664000	about 80 Fahrenheit.
664000	667000	So because it actually is a problem there.
667000	669000	If you don't have air conditioning,
669000	671000	like 80 is actually harmful for the elderly,
671000	673000	but it's like for everyone else, it's like, okay,
673000	674000	it's going to be a little warm,
674000	677000	but that's probably going to do the same thing in Pokemon go.
677000	679000	It's going to shut off and it's like, Oh no, it's too hot.
679000	683000	Here's my suggestion for Niantic on how to fix this because a lot of the
683000	686000	players are kind of irritated at this because the weather system is actually
686000	690000	really awesome because it has really mixed up the types of Pokemon that you
690000	694000	see. Like I'm seeing way different stuff now with, you know, when it's,
694000	696000	you know, sunny and cloudy and all that stuff.
696000	699000	But this kind of puts a big stink on the whole thing.
699000	703000	But my suggestion for Niantic is you need to filter the title of these alerts
703000	706000	and look for severe weather statement.
706000	707000	Yeah.
707000	709000	That would be the stuff that would be hurricanes.
709000	711000	Tornado, blizzard.
711000	713000	Well, honestly, if you do severe weather statement,
713000	716000	I think anything that falls in that category is going to do that.
716000	719000	But you need to filter out these. That's a cautionary statement.
719000	723000	It really makes me wonder just how sophisticated the API is because I'm sure
723000	724000	that's got to be part of it.
724000	725000	It's not.
725000	727000	Plot twist.
727000	728000	Well, there you go.
728000	732000	Anyway, the last break band in our chat at live.vognetwork.com says,
732000	735000	What the fuck? The weather people in California sound bored.
735000	737000	Yeah, kinda. Sometimes.
737000	740000	Anyway, I should introduce I should give our chat room a proper introduction.
740000	741000	Hello, guys.
741000	744000	We do tape live, of course, every Sunday nights at the voice geeks network
744000	748000	vognetwork.com 6 o'clock Pacific 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby
748000	750000	Black Wolf show.
750000	753000	And that's where you guys are chatting along with our show right now.
753000	758000	Tiger Claw points out, guys, today is the 30th anniversary of Mega Man.
758000	761000	It came out on December 17th, 1987.
761000	762000	How about that?
762000	764000	Mega Man is officially 30 years old today.
764000	768000	And I would have made a lame joke about how Capcom has pretty much, you know,
768000	769000	kicked Mega Man to the curb.
769000	772000	But Mega Man 11 kind of saved the day, didn't it?
772000	774000	And now we're going to Mega Man X collection.
774000	777000	So I can't really talk shit about Capcom right now with Mega Man.
777000	778000	So let me ask this.
778000	782000	Favorite Mega Man stage in any game.
782000	783000	You can do X if you want.
783000	787000	Favorite Mega Man stage in any game.
787000	791000	That's going to be a little bit difficult because it's kind of like my least
791000	793000	favorite and most favorite.
793000	796000	And that's the Mega Dragon in Mega Man 2.
796000	797000	Okay.
797000	798000	So you're picking Wily's Castle part one.
798000	799000	Yeah.
799000	800000	Part two.
800000	801000	Sorry.
801000	803000	Wily's Castle into part one.
803000	804000	Yes.
804000	805000	No, not part one.
805000	807000	It was part one.
807000	808000	It was part one.
808000	809000	The dragon was the boss of part one.
809000	810000	No, never mind.
810000	811000	Because two is when you fall down.
811000	812000	And anyway.
812000	813000	I like that one too.
813000	814000	Yeah.
814000	815000	I just pretty much like the whole Wily stage in two.
815000	816000	They have the same music.
816000	817000	That's what you can use.
817000	818000	So anyway.
818000	819000	But that's your favorite?
819000	820000	Yeah, that dragon's pretty bad.
820000	821000	Pretty much the whole Wily stage.
821000	822000	Yeah.
822000	823000	I would say.
823000	824000	Okay.
824000	825840	Because I had that whole thing down to a science.
825840	829840	And I used to be able to do that level blindfolded.
829840	830900	What about you, JD?
830900	834660	So I'm going to have to admit, I'm going to need to buy this collection of all the Mega
834660	835660	Man games.
835660	836660	Because you haven't played any?
836660	838000	Because I don't think I've ever beaten a Mega Man game.
838000	839340	That's okay if you haven't beaten one.
839340	840340	They're kind of hard.
840340	842420	I played some of them when I was in elementary school.
842420	844140	Do you remember any of them?
844140	845540	Usually the one that comes to mind first.
845540	849060	I remember the names of some of them, but I haven't really sat down and gone through
849060	850060	a level.
850060	851060	Okay.
851060	852060	Like, I've watched other people play.
852060	853060	You ignorant child.
853060	854060	I'm just kidding.
854060	856220	Well, I mean, Mega Man is only six months younger than me.
856220	857740	Shut up.
857740	858740	Alright.
858740	860940	Loki, how about you?
860940	861940	Favorite Mega Man?
861940	862940	I don't know.
862940	865100	It's been so long since I played those.
865100	866100	Probably.
866100	867100	That's easy for me.
867460	872100	I like when you have to go back in number two to fight some of the bosses from number
872100	873100	one.
873100	874100	That's kind of fun.
874100	875100	But there's like four stages for that.
875100	876100	That doesn't happen.
876100	877100	That's me.
877100	878100	You're thinking Mega Man three.
878100	879100	You go back and fight Mega Man two.
879100	880100	You sure?
880100	881100	Yeah.
881100	882100	I thought that was in two.
882100	883100	Chatters?
883100	884100	Am I wrong?
884100	885100	Because you have to fight Metal Man again.
885100	886100	Nope.
886100	887100	In two.
887100	888100	You have to go back and fight.
888100	889100	In fact, this is in every Mega Man game.
889100	891780	You have to go back and fight all the bosses again from the same game that you're in.
891780	892780	Right.
892780	893780	For the same game.
893780	895940	I thought they had the ones from number one in there as well.
895940	896940	No.
897780	898780	In three, you went back and fought the bosses in two.
898780	899780	Oh.
899780	900780	And they redid.
900780	903780	They alter some of the stages, the corner stages, and you do like two bosses.
903780	904780	Yeah.
904780	905780	I remember that.
905780	906780	Okay.
906780	907780	Well.
907780	908780	I guess I'm the only one that remembers these games.
908780	909780	Jesus.
909780	910780	All right.
910780	911780	No, it's fine.
911780	912780	Girl.
912780	913780	Let's see.
913780	914780	Okay.
914780	915780	So my favorite, easy, hands down, Elec Man.
915780	916780	It's because of the music in the original Mega Man game.
916780	917780	It's my favorite music in any stage is Elec Man.
917780	919260	She's a really good sound designer.
919260	920260	Really good composer.
920260	921260	Oh, yeah.
921260	922260	Oh, yeah.
922260	923260	She was amazing.
923260	924260	Well, she didn't die.
924260	925900	She has a new album coming out soon.
925900	926900	She does.
927860	928860	She is amazing.
928860	929860	She is a good composer.
929860	930860	Yes.
930860	931860	Yes.
931860	932860	I'm just giving you crap.
932860	933860	Isn't that what I said?
933860	934860	Our word wasn't me.
934860	935860	Well, you said was.
935860	936860	I was like, well, she didn't die.
936860	938980	She was a mag fest the last time I went.
938980	939980	So yeah.
939980	942420	I do know the music from Mega Man well enough because that's like everywhere.
942420	943420	Okay.
943420	944420	So what's your favorite Mega Man song?
944420	945420	Well, I don't know the names.
945420	946420	I just hear them on radio.
946420	947420	Oh, Jesus.
947420	948420	Bubble Man's the same.
948420	949420	Just say Bubble Man.
949420	951420	Or say, what's another popular one?
951420	953420	I'm trying to think of the popular one.
953420	954420	Crash Bandicoot.
954420	955420	Crash Man.
955420	956420	Crash Man.
956940	957940	Anyway.
957940	958940	All right.
958940	959940	Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
959940	961940	Quick Man's music was rad.
961940	965700	Dark Tetsuya says, I think three was my favorite of the series.
965700	968660	Black Wolf says, my favorite thing about Mega Man is the Megas.
968660	971740	Vid Power says Air Man's song is a great song.
971740	972740	That was, you know what?
972740	975780	Air Man's stage was the first stage I ever played in any Mega Man game.
975780	976780	And I remember that.
976780	979620	They always would tell people to start with Air Man and I never would.
979620	981460	I'd always start with Metal Man.
981460	982460	Yes.
982460	985780	There's kind of two loops through the game and you can start with Air Man, but I agree.
986140	987420	Metal Man, I think is easier to start with.
987420	993700	And don't forget, we got from that game, Air Man got Taos and I.
993700	994700	Okay.
994700	996300	Let's embarrass ourselves in front of the listeners.
996300	997300	You ready?
997300	998300	Do you remember?
998300	999300	Okay.
999300	1000300	Starting with Metal Man.
1000300	1001300	Do you remember Love?
1001300	1002300	That's my cross.
1002300	1006460	Do you remember the path through Mega Man to what bosses to do in what order?
1006460	1007700	Starting with whatever you want.
1007700	1012020	I would always do them a little bit out of order because I would always do Mega Man,
1012020	1016460	Flash Man and Flash Man just because you can always use the weapon.
1016460	1021980	And then I would do Air Man and then I would go do Quick Man with Flash Man's weapon.
1021980	1028140	And then I would do Heat Man with Quick Man.
1028140	1029740	I don't know.
1029740	1030740	That's right.
1030740	1031740	No.
1031740	1032740	I would do Bubble Man.
1032740	1034260	I would just beat everybody with the metal blades anyway.
1034260	1036100	You just kick all their asses.
1036100	1038380	You just beat them with the metal blades anyway.
1038380	1040420	It doesn't matter because they shoot diagonal.
1040420	1041420	Let's see.
1041820	1045860	I always started with Metal Man and then Metal Man to Flash Man, Flash Man to Quick Man,
1045860	1047420	Quick Man to...
1047420	1049340	Yeah, this is where I get stuck too.
1049340	1051540	I can't remember what Quick Man worked well on.
1051540	1052540	Was it...
1052540	1053580	Bubble Man?
1053580	1054580	Was it Bubble Man?
1054580	1055580	I don't know.
1055580	1059100	Because that would make sense because the bubble is what you use on Heat.
1059100	1060100	Heat is Wood Man.
1060100	1062820	You can kill Wood Man with one super fire shot.
1062820	1063820	Wood Man is Air Man.
1063820	1065180	Air Man is Crash Man.
1065180	1067860	You need the bubble lead for the final wily fight.
1067860	1068860	I think that's it.
1068860	1069860	Did I name eight?
1069860	1070860	I think I just named the path through the game.
1071300	1073740	And you need the bubble lead to beat two.
1073740	1076300	Well, yeah, yeah, that's the super weapon at the end.
1076300	1080700	And in three it's the top man, which was otherwise fucking useless.
1080700	1081700	Alright.
1081700	1085820	Chatter's agree, it was Bubble Man after Quick Man.
1085820	1086820	That's what I thought.
1086820	1087820	Alright.
1087820	1088820	So I sort of remembered.
1088820	1089820	Yay.
1089820	1090820	Alright.
1090820	1091820	Let's get into the real kickoff topic for tonight.
1091820	1096580	I mean, Mega Man, celebrating that is always fun, but it just goes to show our live chatters
1096580	1099700	will derail this show at any moment for any reason.
1099700	1104620	So anyway, I want to go to, I want to talk about this because this is a controversial
1104620	1105740	topic around this week.
1105740	1108700	You know, this is usually the time of year when the gaming news slows down, but this
1108700	1109700	year's been kind of different.
1109700	1112980	Like, I feel like we've still got a lot of stuff to talk about tonight.
1112980	1118020	Starting with this, and it has to do with something that the creator of PUBG, which
1118020	1122260	I sometimes call Pugbee, which I know is out of order, but pugs are cute, which of course
1122260	1124400	I'm talking about Player Unknown Battlegrounds.
1124400	1126380	And Brendan Greene is the creator of this game.
1126380	1131280	And a little statement that he made is kind of floating around the blogs this week.
1131280	1134540	And it's kind of, you know, I don't, I don't know how much of this, this guy kind of like
1134540	1140580	truly feels or how much is kind of a shaped quote to make articles sound clicky.
1140580	1146660	But anyway, apparently what's going on is that he's not too big on copycats of PUBG.
1146660	1152260	And I don't think this is so much about, cause we know a few months ago or maybe even less
1152260	1155940	than that, there was a little bit of a hubbub with Fortnite.
1155940	1159220	And you know, I don't think they were feeling too great about that, but I don't think this
1159220	1160460	is what he's addressing here.
1160460	1164860	He's talking a little bit more about, you go to like some of the mobile phone fronts,
1164860	1169180	especially like China, you're going to see shit where they have just like straight up
1169180	1175140	downloaded the assets, the maps, you know, they've basically ripped off the game.
1175140	1179980	So anyway, he didn't drop any names when he was talking about what his problems was, were
1179980	1180980	though.
1180980	1184500	But Brendan, the creator of PUBG said, I want other developers to put their own spin on
1184500	1187560	the game, not just lift things from our game.
1187560	1191020	And this came from an interview he did with BBC Radio 1.
1191020	1195180	In movies and music, there is IP production and you can really look after your work.
1195180	1198660	In gaming, that doesn't exist yet and it's something that could be, should be looked
1198660	1199660	into.
1199660	1206220	But didn't he rip his game off of H1Z1 King of the Kill, I mean, it's basically the same
1206220	1207220	game.
1207220	1208820	Yeah, I mean, there you go.
1208820	1209820	Now he did.
1209820	1212740	I just, I like people preaching like, oh, it should be this way.
1212740	1215300	You're fucking guilty of the same shit.
1215300	1219420	He did say, though, that he's not trying to shut down anyone who copies elements from
1219420	1221980	his game, but he wants the genre to grow.
1221980	1224640	And that's only going to happen when developers find new ways to do things.
1224640	1230860	And he said in this quote, for the genre to grow, you need new and interesting spins on
1230860	1231860	the game mode.
1231860	1237400	If it just copycats down the line, then the genre doesn't grow and people get bored.
1237400	1243320	So and apparently it was called out that some of the PUBG clones in China, they're everywhere
1243320	1244320	and there are problems.
1244320	1245320	Yeah, that's China.
1245320	1246320	Well, right.
1246320	1252280	And China has rampant IP theft because it's China and it's not the US.
1252280	1255480	There's not a lot you can do really with that type of stuff.
1255480	1262020	But usually the quality of said games kind of travels around and we kind of know that,
1262020	1263480	you know, they're to stay away from.
1263480	1266080	And this isn't exactly a new thing either, right?
1266080	1272280	Like haven't we heard like of the Final Fantasy 7 on the NES that was like a hacked ROM thing?
1272280	1276320	Like even more modern, like, you know, there's Overwatch has probably had some stuff.
1276320	1277320	Oh, God.
1277320	1278320	Several.
1278320	1279320	Oh, sure.
1279320	1280320	Sure.
1280320	1281320	Of course.
1281320	1282320	Yeah.
1282320	1283320	And then they'll just take those straight up steal the Overwatch characters and put
1283320	1284520	them in other games.
1284520	1285520	Sometimes that can be funny, though.
1285520	1288400	Wasn't there also like a Pokemon Go clone that somebody made?
1288400	1293400	Well, there's that whole Draconis thing that I played for like a week, which is interesting.
1293400	1298680	But the interesting thing about that, even though, like, it's totally like a copy of
1298680	1304040	Pokemon Go from about a year ago, like, what's weird is that they stole that.
1304040	1307060	And then they but they did all new monsters and that whole thing.
1307060	1312080	But then they kind of like added new shit like they were like, but now we have PvP and
1312080	1316280	we have these portals that you can travel to to go to the underworld, which is just
1316280	1317920	the same world, but it's a different color.
1317920	1320480	It's like the upside down and stranger things or something, right?
1320480	1321480	It's actually kind of cool.
1321480	1322920	Yeah, no, it's actually kind of cool.
1322920	1327840	It's just because it's very clear that this was an outsourced developed game.
1327840	1332600	It kind of it's not very well optimized and it kind of feels cheapy.
1332600	1336160	But some people kind of prefer it to Pokemon Go.
1336160	1341200	I don't because there's no Bluetooth and Pikachu is way cuter than Potty, which, yes, one of
1341200	1344880	the one of the monsters Draconis is called Potty.
1344880	1347420	It's a little it's a little fire pot.
1347420	1348840	That's why he's called Potty.
1348840	1352960	But I don't know if the developers realize that a potty is also something you go poo
1352960	1354460	poo in.
1354460	1357880	So I don't I don't know if they realize that when they translated it.
1357880	1361640	Does it evolve from squatty?
1361640	1365280	You'd have to ask the RuPaul podcast about that, because that's not something we pitch
1365280	1366280	here.
1366280	1367280	All right.
1367280	1368280	Anyway.
1368280	1370320	Well, what do you guys think, Loki?
1370320	1371320	What do you think?
1371320	1372320	What do you think?
1372320	1377760	Because my mind went to the whole like I know this is like years old here on O.L.R., but
1377760	1380700	we did talk many years ago about the whole debate.
1380700	1382920	Remember when In the Groove came out?
1382920	1386680	Was that basically a theft of DDR?
1386680	1390160	And years later, probably a couple of years ago at this point.
1390160	1393160	But we actually had, you know, Kyle Ward, who was a big part of In the Groove, actually
1393160	1397760	came on this show and we kind of got to hear it from the other side, because, you know,
1397760	1400340	I'm not going to lie about what happened at the time.
1400340	1403080	I wasn't very keen on In the Groove.
1403080	1407880	I did kind of feel like it was jacking a lot from DDR at the time.
1407880	1411000	But then, you know, years pass, you get older, sometimes your mind's changed.
1411000	1416920	And I also see where In the Groove was kind of trying to fill a gap that Konami was leaving
1416920	1417920	out there.
1417920	1423400	And, you know, and I always kind of think the biggest mistake that game made was releasing
1423400	1427560	on PlayStation 2, because when they were in the arcades, they weren't really infringing
1427560	1430480	on Konami's turf because those games weren't legal here.
1430480	1435240	But when they released on PS2, that was the big thing that allowed Konami to to smack
1435240	1436240	it down.
1436240	1440520	Anyway, I don't mean to rehash that whole thing because, well, because, again, I think
1440520	1444560	if you ask me now how I feel about it, I think my answer would be different than what I would
1444560	1449420	have said 10 years ago when I was like, yeah, 10 years ago I said, yeah, it's just it's
1449420	1450420	not as good.
1450420	1451420	It's a copy of a copy or whatever.
1451420	1455280	But now, like kind of looking back, I kind of go, well, you know what?
1455280	1458920	Somebody had to do something because Konami was going to let that genre die.
1458920	1463480	And so I kind of give props to them for trying to do something.
1463480	1467840	I mean, I remember being kind of mad in 2006, but a lot of that was I was mad at Konami
1467840	1470720	and it was coming out at being mad at Rockstar.
1470720	1474200	Like that's like that filter kind of a thing, you know.
1474200	1478440	So yeah, I hear you here.
1478440	1483200	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,
1483200	1484760	use the passphrase sister.
1484760	1487640	Well, anyway, that's that's years ago.
1487640	1488640	What do you think?
1488640	1489640	Fast forwarding to now.
1489640	1491320	But I can't help but see things in that perspective, right?
1491320	1495860	Is that I feel like this debate we've kind of had before, but something that was very
1495860	1500200	fascinating from that, you know, Kyle interview and some folks in chat are saying, bring him
1500200	1501200	back, bring him back.
1501200	1505080	If he has something to promote, which he does with that StepMania X thing, I'm sure at some
1505080	1506080	point we will have him back.
1506080	1507220	And he's always welcome back on the show.
1507220	1511000	But if you haven't heard that interview and you're a music game fan, like even though
1511000	1514960	the episode is like two, three years old at this point, go fucking listen to it, because
1514960	1519960	we learned a lot about the fucking iron grip that Konami had on that whole genre.
1519960	1520960	It's from 2015.
1520960	1522640	I want to say August.
1522640	1527200	It was whatever year I went to PAX East, because that's when we connected.
1527200	1530380	I'm sure if you search the wiki for Kyle Ward, you'll find it.
1530380	1532560	Is there a wiki for Orange Lounge Radio?
1532560	1534280	Oh, yeah, there's a wiki for Orange Lounge Radio.
1534280	1535280	I don't know if that is.
1535280	1536280	Oh, yeah, probably.
1536280	1537280	Of course it is.
1537280	1538980	There's the page that has all the episode summaries.
1538980	1540800	So you can search the wiki for that.
1540800	1541800	You're right.
1541800	1542800	Thank you.
1542800	1546640	But anyway, so that's that's old, but I can't help but reference that.
1546640	1550040	But going back to the new Loki, do you think what do you think?
1550040	1555040	Does PUBG need to chill a little bit here or do they kind of you know, there are a lot
1555040	1556840	of rip offs in China, actually.
1556840	1557840	What do you think?
1557840	1560400	Well, that's just a given that there's going to be rip offs of that.
1560400	1565560	I think it's not necessarily him complaining about rip offs from China because there's
1565560	1566560	that.
1566560	1571540	But I think he's concerned that people are ripping them off, like in other games, like
1571540	1576580	because Grand Theft Auto had their kind of PUBG type game and then they added that mode
1576580	1577580	to, you know, Fortnite.
1577580	1581620	And I think he's feeling like, well, that was my original idea.
1581620	1584540	And now everybody's getting a piece of the pie, too.
1584540	1591940	You know, I just find that just very elitist that he would consider that he started this
1591940	1594580	genre of game because I'm sorry, you didn't.
1594580	1601100	I mean, it's fucking battle royale, like all these games have done this shit before.
1601100	1603940	You just have a popular, you have the current popular version.
1603940	1608020	It's back when, remember, like even if you want to go back further, it's where they tried
1608020	1612900	to copy, say they copyrighted a genre like Street Fighter versus Mortal Kombat.
1612900	1616460	You know, well, who owns the fighting game genre?
1616460	1621140	You know, somebody, oh, that's just a Street Fighter clone or that's a Doom clone.
1621140	1625020	There's going to be, it's a genre now and that's, you're just going to be used to the
1625020	1627060	fact that there's going to be competition.
1627060	1629680	You know what's funny when you talk about the genre is because maybe for somebody like
1629680	1635280	me who doesn't always get into these types of games, I just go, it's a first person shooter
1635280	1638280	game.
1638280	1641080	I think for a lot of people out there, chatters, am I wrong?
1641080	1645960	Does anybody else feel this way that like, if you haven't read a lot about PUBG or whatever,
1645960	1650000	you kind of look at it and go, oh, it looks like a counter strikey call of duty kind of
1650000	1651000	thing.
1651000	1652000	I don't know if I'm into that.
1652000	1653840	I mean, that's basically my take on the game.
1653840	1654840	Thank you.
1654840	1655840	I know.
1655840	1660160	There are PUBG fans who are going to hear that and go, what a bunch of idiots.
1660160	1665360	But I'm sorry, that's, you know, until you take the deep dive into kind of looking at
1665360	1668800	that game a little more, that's, it just looks like another pew pew shooty shooty game.
1668800	1671840	I mean, to be fair, I pretty much exclusively don't play shooters.
1671840	1675280	The most I'll do is Portal or Splatoon.
1675280	1678880	But I see, I'm in this weird place where I can kind of say that I don't usually get into
1678880	1683920	like Call of Duty type of games, but like Destiny's rad, Overwatch is cool.
1684480	1689080	And I do actually understand the difference between what PUBG is and, you know, Fortnite
1689080	1690080	and all this stuff.
1690080	1695000	I do understand the battle royale genre, but I know there was a certain period of time
1695000	1698960	when I wasn't as well versed on what PUBG was where I was kind of like, oh, it's just
1698960	1701760	another shooty game I'll probably just won't get into.
1701760	1703240	And I still haven't gotten into it.
1703240	1707200	But I mean, anything with real time aiming, it's like it's its own genre kind of thing.
1707200	1711540	Like shooting arrows in Zelda can be problematic for me because it's still like you have to
1711540	1713060	hit things and they're moving.
1713060	1714860	And I have trouble with that.
1714860	1717640	Going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
1717640	1722740	First off, the super sleuths in the chat, we've been referencing episode number 596.
1722740	1726760	So you can Google Orange On Radio 596 from May 3rd, 2015.
1726760	1727760	So there it is.
1727760	1729460	Anyway, thank you, guys.
1729460	1734780	Also, let's see in chat, Ragenator says over at live.vognetwork.com, I was going to reference
1734780	1741060	the fact that before the term first person shooter was coined, all FPSs were called Doom
1741060	1742060	Jones.
1742060	1744760	Yeah, I remember that for a bit, too.
1744760	1751220	But even when Doom first came out, oh, it's Wolfenstein.
1751220	1757020	But in more three dimensions, because Wolfenstein was really kind of a 2D game in a 3D space.
1757020	1760500	I know that sounds weird to say, but like if you go into the map editor, the map editor
1760500	1762420	is like pure 2D.
1762420	1764420	It's blocks, right?
1764420	1767740	But I know and not everybody's going to agree with what I just said.
1767740	1768740	That's fine.
1768740	1769740	Let's see.
1770300	1774380	Dungeon Buster in chat says I might not have to deal with China, but they didn't flip out
1774380	1777560	when Doom killers and clones eventually came out.
1777560	1779740	They just upped their tech in response.
1779740	1781260	There you go.
1781260	1784460	Bobby Blackwell points out the Doom added elevation, but you still couldn't look up
1784460	1785460	or down.
1785460	1786460	So, whatever.
1786460	1789740	I played Duke Nukem 3D anyway, which was totally different, right?
1789740	1791360	Duke Nukem 3D was a totally different game.
1791360	1792660	Has my favorite quote in it.
1792660	1793660	What, your face, your ass?
1793660	1794660	Your face, your ass.
1794660	1796660	What's the difference?
1796660	1804420	I had that as a WAV file I would play in the old AOL chat rooms, which by the way, R-A-P-AOL.
1804420	1806060	Rest in peace AOL Instant Messenger.
1806060	1807060	You're right.
1807060	1808060	That was something that happened this week.
1808060	1815580	I had all of my usernames that I had as AOL accounts in AIM and I met my husband that
1815580	1816580	way.
1816580	1823460	I made a lot of friends who became my con buddies and I had friends in the Bay Area
1823460	1825420	before I had ever set foot in the Bay Area.
1825420	1827940	So it's just, yeah, R-A-P-AOL.
1827940	1832260	I definitely did a lot of chatting through AIM, you know, probably when Alan and I first
1832260	1835660	got together, it was a lot of, it was all chatting with live journal friends on AIM.
1835660	1839500	And sometimes I was playing the survivor games and big brother games on live journal.
1839500	1844220	It was all through AIM and now they all moved to Facebook a few years ago.
1844220	1845220	So yeah.
1845220	1852740	But when AOL back in the day extended their screen names from 10 letters to 15, I was
1852740	1855040	the first person to take Queen Emeraldus.
1855040	1856040	Thank you.
1856040	1857040	What do you want?
1857040	1858040	A cookie?
1858040	1859040	Yes.
1859040	1860040	I would really like a cookie.
1860040	1863160	Well, I was the first person that had mad tea party 78 because that was my name.
1863160	1865640	I can say that now because it's not like you message me.
1865640	1868960	So there you go.
1868960	1870680	All right.
1870680	1871680	What was my other?
1871680	1872680	I don't remember.
1872680	1874000	I had, I had like five.
1874000	1876840	I had Majin Bura for the longest time.
1876840	1877840	Didn't you just have dark Sakura?
1877840	1883420	I had dark Sakura for ages too, but I was Majin Bura before that on AOL.
1883420	1887860	And then I had, I had like one for sailor aluminum siren.
1887860	1893820	And then, um, but I also had dark Ukyo cause Dan had dark Ryoga.
1893820	1897380	See, I was on Prodigy before AOL.
1897380	1902380	So we called it Buttigy.
1902380	1906540	But well it was, it was Buttigy when I ran up that $70 bill or whatever it was using
1906540	1907540	chat rooms.
1907540	1908540	Yes.
1908540	1909540	Prodigy.
1909540	1912960	I remember that I was, we were, I was messing with a friend and we were trying to submit
1913000	1918600	like a stupid joke to their joke, like forum website thing or something like that.
1918600	1920760	And that like costs like $60.
1920760	1921760	No it didn't.
1921760	1922760	Bam.
1922760	1926480	It costs like 60 bucks in like fees because it was calling a long distance number or something
1926480	1927480	like that.
1927480	1928480	Oh no.
1928480	1930200	We had a local number in Roseville or something.
1930200	1933480	So we were able to, I was able to be on Prodigy for like four hours a day.
1933480	1938120	But the problem was when they started opening the plus stuff that costs by the minute, that's
1938120	1939720	when it got dangerous.
1939720	1940960	So yeah.
1940960	1942920	Look forward to that in 2018.
1942920	1943920	That's right.
1943920	1945200	Cost by the minute.
1945200	1948040	You think porn is free now.
1948040	1955060	That's a really good way to explain like net neutrality importance to somebody over 40.
1955060	1960200	Remember when Prodigy and AOL charged for plus services?
1960200	1964440	I remember when AIM came out as a standalone program because like all of my friends had
1964440	1969860	AOL and my dad didn't like AOL as an internet service provider for reasons.
1969860	1974180	So like AIM came out as a standalone and I was like, oh, now I can chat with people,
1974180	1975740	you know, that I previously had to email.
1975740	1977280	That was a neat thing to happen.
1977280	1980620	Did you ever build yourself a quilt out of free AOL discs?
1980620	1984900	Uh, not a quilt because how are you going to stitch together CDs?
1984900	1988420	Cause they came in little cardboard things.
1988420	1989900	I just mostly remember the CDs.
1989900	1994500	The floppies were around, but they were harder to get for me.
1994500	2000420	One of my friends who was very crafty and DIY before DIY was cool tried to make an oven
2000420	2001420	out of AOL CDs.
2001420	2003500	How do you make an oven?
2003500	2009220	You get like a high powered bulb and line the inside of a box with broken CDs and it's
2009220	2010860	supposed to reflect.
2010860	2011860	Why did I fucking ask?
2011860	2012860	Like why?
2012860	2017200	Like I knew she would, I should have known she would have an actual answer because I
2017200	2018200	always have an answer.
2018200	2021460	In reality, I don't fucking care, but you're terrible.
2022460	2027660	What if, what if we lose all power and the only way that you have to cook any food is
2027660	2030540	with a camp stove made out of AOL discs, Rob?
2030540	2034580	I mean, seriously, it's not going to get very hot cause they're plastic.
2034580	2036220	Guess where all those AOL discs are now?
2036220	2037860	They're in a fucking landfill somewhere.
2037860	2041380	Well, I'm, I'm the only person in this room, I guess it has survival skills.
2041380	2042380	Okay.
2042380	2043380	Whatever.
2043380	2044540	Here's the, here's the thing with dark Sakura is that she would be the one that would be
2044540	2049700	at the high school reunion go, yeah, I invented post-its and first, first you thermoset your
2049700	2054460	resin and when the temperature gets here, your glucose, it's you.
2054460	2059800	My favorite thing with the AOL CDs though is somebody organized a campaign to mail them
2059800	2063060	back to AOL in large scale.
2063060	2067460	Like he mobilized everybody who's getting all of these unwanted spam discs and said,
2067460	2072620	we'll just mail them back to AOL cause if everyone pays his own postage, it's not expensive.
2072620	2076740	And I think that's one of the reasons AOL stopped mailing out CDs.
2076740	2079580	Here's Bobby Black Wolf with a funny joke on that whole thing.
2079580	2085420	Bobby Black Wolf says, uh, over at chat live.vognotework.com dark Sakura, are you saying Rob's house is
2085420	2089340	the Atlanta airport because of the blackout that happened there today?
2089340	2094220	Because if you die, it doesn't matter if you go to hell or no, I think that Rob's house
2094220	2097100	is like the Atlanta airport and that it's a shit to navigate.
2097100	2098940	What do you mean?
2098940	2100940	Kidding, kidding, kidding.
2100940	2101940	One hallway.
2101940	2102940	You just have to navigate around the laundry pile.
2102940	2109140	At least you don't have, you know, the, uh, the never ending escalator, but you got those
2109140	2110980	shady characters sleeping on seats.
2110980	2112340	So, you know, it's true.
2112340	2117700	Look, there's a, there's this homeless guy, Mr. Smoosh, that just stays on that chair.
2117700	2121740	He's got a pair of daddies who love him and an auntie Jamie who spoils the shit out of
2121740	2122740	him.
2122740	2127380	Just so you guys know that a cat tunnel that Jamie brought to the show last week for Mr.
2127380	2132260	Smoosh, he fucking loves that thing, but he can't just be bothered to crawl through the
2132260	2134220	tunnel like a normal cat would know.
2134220	2135780	He darts through the fucking tunnel.
2135780	2139060	He looks through it and he goes and like darts through it and then looks through it again.
2139060	2140060	Shake, shake, shake.
2140060	2141220	And he makes so much noise.
2141220	2143660	By the way, this all happens at three in the morning.
2143660	2145120	That's what cats do.
2145120	2149220	My cat likes to play with their Christmas tree and tries to knock it over and be like
2149220	2150220	another asshole.
2150220	2154100	Did you notice what we, did you notice what we didn't bother to put up this year?
2154100	2155100	Yeah.
2155100	2157780	Did you, if you, cause if you say Christmas tree, cause guess where the Christmas tree
2157780	2158780	goes?
2158780	2159780	To hell.
2159780	2160780	In the window.
2160780	2164220	In the window in the exact spot where Mr. Smoosh decided one day, I'm just going to
2164220	2169420	knock everything over to get to this spot where I can look out the window.
2169420	2173420	And so if I put a tree there, a tree's not going to, that tree going to die.
2173420	2174420	Important news alert.
2174420	2175420	Okay.
2175420	2176420	Yes.
2176420	2177420	Cher will be in Mamma Mia too.
2177420	2179340	Bitch, where you been?
2179340	2180540	That was announced like two months ago.
2180540	2182540	Oh, I didn't know.
2182540	2187420	It was Jamie, the conductor of the derail train.
2187420	2190580	It probably took Facebook two months to show it because you know how Facebook is.
2190580	2191580	That is true.
2192140	2193780	That I will, I will accept that answer.
2193780	2194780	All right.
2194780	2198860	Anyway, at one point we were talking about player unknown battlegrounds, but this being
2198860	2201140	orange launch radio at derail.
2201140	2205380	So let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks and maybe we can get some video game
2205380	2208700	content on our video game program.
2208700	2212220	Dark Sakura, how was your video gaming week?
2212220	2218300	Um, I played animal crossing and some me Tomo.
2218300	2221460	I'm actually getting kind of tired of me Tomo finally.
2221460	2227020	Um, I've played some ingress, but I need more bursters.
2227020	2228020	This again, right?
2228020	2231140	Well, it's those people who try to take over my work.
2231140	2233180	Um, and I'm playing Pokemon go.
2233180	2235100	I caught a mudkip today.
2235100	2236100	Good job.
2236100	2237100	I heard you like mudkips.
2237100	2238100	Yeah.
2238100	2239100	Yeah.
2239100	2241260	I was going to post it on Facebook, but it said not to.
2242260	2251300	I did play a little bit of dragon age inquisition, but I put up a, um, a poll on Facebook on
2251300	2258260	which MMO I should go back to final fantasy 14 or, or, uh, wow.
2258260	2260780	I missed this poll somehow.
2260780	2261780	What's yeah.
2261780	2262780	Cause it's on Facebook.
2262780	2263780	What's what's winning.
2263780	2264780	I don't know.
2264780	2266780	Cause I'm waiting for the poll to finish.
2266780	2268540	Um, I guess I could go look at it.
2268540	2269820	I'll find it and repost it.
2269820	2276140	But um, one of my friends, like just one of her friends randomly, we ran into each
2276140	2280000	other at the grocery store while my friend was there with us.
2280000	2285260	And she's, and so the, their free company person's like, I will buy you an apartment
2285260	2287140	if you come join us.
2287140	2292120	I'm like, well then again, void elves.
2292120	2294360	Why wouldn't somebody buy me an apartment in real life?
2294360	2295360	That's unfortunate.
2295360	2296360	Void elves.
2296360	2297360	All right.
2297360	2298360	But actually I like my demon spawn better.
2298360	2299360	My demon hunter.
2299360	2300360	Sorry.
2300360	2302360	Uh, anything else for you?
2302360	2305520	Um, super Mario Odyssey is still fun.
2305520	2306520	Yes it is.
2306520	2307520	Yep.
2307520	2309200	How many, how many Mooney things are you up to?
2309200	2310200	Well, it's not me.
2310200	2311200	It's Dan playing it.
2311200	2313000	Oh, but you're, you're, he's mooning everybody.
2313000	2315200	I've seen you guys play games together before though.
2315200	2316200	I'm more like his navigator.
2316200	2317200	Yeah.
2317200	2318200	Dan playing a video game.
2318200	2319200	Is you being a backseat driver the entire time?
2319200	2320200	Pretty much.
2320200	2324200	Well, that's how we got through breath of the wild cause I'm like, no, the wrong way.
2324200	2325200	No.
2325200	2326640	Your other left.
2326640	2327640	It's like he's in band.
2327640	2330040	You're like the world's worst GPS.
2330040	2331040	Girl.
2331040	2332040	All right.
2332040	2333040	I can get anywhere I want to.
2333040	2334040	All right.
2334040	2335320	JD wants to comment and then I'm going to get to Loki's.
2335320	2338640	Have you tried playing Odyssey in two player mode or one of you does the hat and the other
2338640	2339640	does Mario?
2339640	2340640	That sounds awful.
2340640	2341720	That sounds like an awful idea.
2341720	2344440	Because I don't cooperate well with others.
2344440	2347600	I basically suggested that to my husband when he was watching me play and he's like, you're
2347600	2350040	going to be better at this and you're just going to get frustrated and yell at me.
2350040	2351400	And I'm like, you're probably right.
2351400	2352400	Accurate.
2352400	2353400	That's how it sounds like.
2353400	2354400	That's married life.
2354400	2355400	Really.
2355400	2356400	It is.
2357160	2360400	You have to do something better and getting frustrated at the other person no matter what.
2360400	2362360	Everyone's got different things.
2362360	2365400	That's the great thing about the relationship Alan and I have when it comes to games, too,
2365400	2368680	because he can play Overwatch and I can go, you know, you're better at Overwatch than
2368680	2369680	I am.
2369680	2370680	Yep.
2370680	2373640	And then he can watch me play something like you can watch me play Mario Odyssey or something
2373640	2374640	else.
2374640	2375640	You know, you're probably better at this than I am.
2375640	2381080	And so it's like we each know which lane to stay in, which is great.
2381080	2382080	Anyway.
2382080	2384080	Loki, how was your gaming week?
2384080	2386280	I actually did play something different this week.
2387160	2391680	Aside from just the Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2 stuff, which is really just grinding for
2391680	2393720	the rest of the characters.
2393720	2399080	I don't know why, because there's not any unique abilities that any of them have.
2399080	2404640	So I started up, because I've been putting it off for weeks now, I started up South Park,
2404640	2406920	the Fractured But Whole.
2406920	2408040	And that game is awesome.
2408040	2409040	It's pretty funny.
2409040	2415200	It hasn't quite gotten into the story of the game, because you know with the Stick of Truth
2415200	2420760	it kind of got into what the actual story of the game is pretty quickly.
2420760	2423600	But this hasn't quite gotten there yet.
2423600	2431160	I'm only on the second day, but it's kind of getting there slowly to figure out what
2431160	2433920	the twist story is going to be in there.
2433920	2435480	But it's very entertaining.
2435480	2438480	The new combat system, I actually kind of like it a little bit.
2438480	2442200	It does mix it up quite a bit from the previous game.
2442200	2447960	The only thing I disliked though is the fact that there's one point where you dual specialized.
2447960	2452160	And so I picked another specialty that I thought I would like, and now I hate it.
2452160	2454720	And I was like, crap, I wish I had picked something else.
2454720	2459180	But I guess the only way you can fix that is by playing the game again from the beginning.
2459180	2463800	And I don't want to do that, but I wish I could have previewed what the abilities were
2463800	2464800	a little bit better.
2464800	2467960	But yeah, I've been really enjoying that, so I'll probably continue playing that.
2467960	2470160	Didn't get around the VR games.
2470160	2471160	Thought about it though.
2472120	2473120	That's it.
2473120	2474120	All right.
2474120	2475120	JD, you want to jump in here?
2475120	2476120	How was your gaming week?
2476120	2477120	Sure.
2477120	2480200	Well, I've been playing Animal Crossing on my phone, and I'm kind of getting a little
2480200	2481200	tired of it.
2481200	2487600	Because once you hit around level 30, level 35, they stop inviting new animals over.
2487600	2490120	So it's just the same ones back and forth.
2490120	2494540	Although they just put out an update today where they've started doing flowers.
2494540	2497120	So I'm immediately interested again.
2497120	2500600	I've been doing Pokemon Go, like we talked about earlier.
2501040	2507180	I've been playing the new Zelda Breath of the Wild DLC content, and I'm about halfway
2507180	2508560	through it.
2508560	2509560	And that's been good.
2509560	2514400	And I did Splatfest this weekend, which was Friday night to Saturday.
2514400	2516400	And that was the sweaters and socks thing, right?
2516400	2517400	Yes.
2517400	2518640	Like what do you enjoy getting more at Christmas?
2518640	2523920	I mean, so they framed it as like, we know that these are terrible gifts, but which one
2523920	2525060	do you like more?
2525060	2529440	And I went with socks because honestly, I would rather pick my own sweater.
2529440	2530440	Socks are just a commodity.
2530440	2531720	I'll take more of them.
2531720	2534160	You know, they wear out and they're easily replaced.
2534160	2536720	Sweaters, I'm like, I want to have my own style.
2536720	2540160	So I would rather get socks as a gift, but my team lost.
2540160	2541240	And they lost big.
2541240	2543600	They lost all three of the things.
2543600	2549880	It was only by like five to 10% on each dimension, but it's like you lose three to zero.
2549880	2552440	I would have picked socks too, for what it's worth.
2552440	2553440	Right.
2553440	2556440	And then Pearl is mean to Marina because Pearl is terrible.
2556440	2557440	Bitch.
2558440	2565360	I've also been playing Oracle of Ages on my 3DS because that was on sale the past couple
2565360	2569040	of weeks and I'm getting around to clearing my backlog on that.
2569040	2570040	All right.
2570040	2572160	Sounds like you've had a productive gaming week.
2572160	2573160	Yeah.
2573160	2575000	My gaming week then, let's see.
2575000	2580160	So besides mobile games, we already talked about like Pogo and stuff, I've been playing
2580160	2582120	more World of Warcraft addict, right?
2582120	2584200	But I'm up to level 105.
2584200	2588280	So on this character, I just started whenever I mentioned I started playing World of Warcraft
2588280	2589280	again.
2589280	2591240	So that's been kind of fun to play through the content again.
2591240	2594040	And I'm at the point where I can do the mobile phone stuff for my mission.
2594040	2595040	So that's kind of cool.
2595040	2598800	But then as far as other games too, I've been playing a little bit on Switch.
2598800	2600280	I played a really cheap game.
2600280	2603800	I mean, it was actually like four or five bucks called Kid Trip, which is kind of like
2603800	2609360	Super Mario Run, but you can, you know, you have a jump button, but then you also have
2609360	2612600	a button to throw a rock and then the mechanics are a little different.
2612600	2616800	But I mean, Kid Trip is kind of cool, but it just, it gets way too hard, way too fast.
2616800	2621400	Like the fifth, I'm on like the fifth level and there's like moving platforms and shit
2621400	2624500	and I can't get past it and it's kind of frustrating.
2624500	2625920	So I don't know.
2625920	2628520	That's my, that's my only thing is that I wish there was a way to maybe tone it down
2628520	2633240	a little bit and so I could maybe enjoy the game a little more, but some of the early
2633240	2634360	levels were fun.
2634360	2638120	And I like how like the little creatures when they kill you, like their faces, they'll get
2638120	2640640	all like, ha ha ha, I killed you bitch.
2640640	2644080	So it's just kind of, I like the little, little flourishes they put in this.
2644080	2648440	Oh, and the game looks very 8-bit because of course it's the hip new thing to do now
2648440	2650640	is make your games look retro, but it works.
2650640	2652900	It works for this game.
2652900	2656900	Also on the Switch though, I will mention, it's been a big pinball week.
2656900	2660200	Dark Soccer, you need to get in on this on Switch because I know you're a pinball fan.
2660200	2663360	So there's two pinball games that released this past week.
2663360	2665600	So the Stern Pinball Collection came out.
2665600	2666600	Yeah.
2666600	2667600	Okay.
2667600	2672520	So they give you, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is the table that they give you as like a
2672520	2673760	free download.
2673760	2677720	But then if you want to buy more tables, so Stern Pinball Arcade, that's the one that's
2677720	2680800	real tables being put in a game.
2680800	2685500	And it also has the new Star Trek table, ACDC.
2685500	2688160	And I can't remember everything else that's in there, but there's other tables too that
2688160	2689160	are like newer tables.
2689160	2692520	Which we could just go to our friends house and play.
2692520	2694120	So you would just rather play the real tables?
2694120	2695120	Kinda.
2695120	2696520	I mean, the video pinball's okay.
2696520	2697520	Yeah.
2698440	2703560	Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, in before Jamie says, I prefer real pinball.
2703560	2704560	Called it.
2704560	2705560	Too late.
2705560	2706560	Too late.
2706560	2708520	But I mean, I'm sure Dan would be interested in something like that.
2708520	2710440	I just, I like playing the real thing.
2710440	2713120	I like feeling the table shake.
2713120	2714640	Yeah, I understand.
2714640	2718920	Well, maybe this other game would be more acceptable for you because also what came
2718920	2723000	out in addition to Stern Pinball Arcade is Pinball FX3, which I've been playing a little
2723000	2724000	more of.
2724000	2727480	Now, the thing about Pinball FX3 is that these are, I don't want to say they're fake tables,
2727480	2728760	but they're not real tables.
2728760	2732840	They were made for video pinball and because of that, they do things that you can't do
2732840	2737520	in real pinball, like Hydra heads that come out of the machine and, you know, do their
2737520	2738520	thing.
2738520	2741360	It was like playing pinball on the NES where like weird shit started happening.
2741360	2742360	But I like that.
2742360	2745280	I'm just thinking of Hydra heads and balls and then my brain went blank.
2745280	2746280	Okay.
2746280	2752060	Well anyway, by the way, hot tip, if you download Pinball FX3 before, I think it's Tuesday.
2752060	2754600	So you either want to do it like tonight while you're listening to OLR live or if you're
2754600	2759100	listening to the podcast on Monday, you want to get it like now because you get three tables
2759100	2760740	free if you do that.
2760740	2764400	Whereas if you wait, you're only going to get the Sorcerer's Lair table for free.
2764400	2765400	On Switch?
2765400	2766400	They're giving away a pack right now.
2766400	2767400	Yeah.
2767400	2768400	On Switch.
2768400	2769400	Let's hold Dan.
2769400	2770400	So, but here's the other cool thing, and I'm going to give them props for this because
2770400	2771400	this is really cool.
2771400	2774840	And I know we talked about this on OLR, but it's one thing to kind of do that, but it's
2774840	2776120	another to see it in motion.
2776120	2778300	They have a vertical mode in it.
2778300	2782400	So when you have your Switch portable, you actually can have the tables in a vertical
2782400	2783400	mode.
2783400	2788480	And that's great because obviously widescreen is not really the right dimensions for a pinball
2788480	2789480	table, right?
2789480	2792960	It's like when you play shooter games, it's like all the space is taken up.
2792960	2796640	And I mean like a space shooter, Ikaruga type of games, right?
2796640	2798100	Like you can't really play those in a widescreen.
2798100	2800140	It's all taken up, right?
2800140	2804800	But the cool thing is with the Switch, you can flip it into vertical mode.
2804800	2806520	And I love that they did that.
2806520	2811500	And I hope this is something that more games will do like the shooter type games to be
2811500	2813860	able to use all the real estate and everything.
2813860	2816880	So that's cool.
2816880	2821040	The controls are a little funky when you're in vertical mode, but you can remap everything.
2821040	2823340	So if you don't like the way it is, you can remap it.
2823340	2826500	I think technically you can have it vertical and still use.
2826500	2832220	Like you can like mount your or I guess lay your Switch against books or whatever and
2832220	2833860	use a pro controller.
2833860	2835300	And that might be a way to do it as well.
2835300	2837660	But anyway, I really like that they have the vertical mode.
2837660	2839300	I wish the Stern game had that too.
2839300	2842660	If it's there, I didn't see it, but I don't think the Stern game has it, but maybe it's
2842660	2847060	something they'll be inspired to do because of what they see Pinball FX doing.
2847060	2851740	The only other thing I could kind of give, that's too bad for on Pinball FX.
2851740	2856360	Well two things, one, none of the Star Wars or Marvel tables came over.
2856360	2859600	So you're not able to play those license tables.
2859600	2862100	You can play like the universal ones.
2862100	2866540	So like Back to the Future came over, Portal came over.
2866580	2869920	Some of their license stuff came over, but not probably their biggest ones, the Marvel
2869920	2871820	and the Star Wars tables.
2871820	2877740	The other, excuse me, the other kind of complaint is that you can link your Switch account to
2877740	2881020	a Xen account, Xen Pinball, right?
2881020	2885580	But it doesn't do you any good because you can't bring over your tables from the PC.
2885580	2890100	So like I have a ton of tables on the PC version because I bought a few and there was a Humble
2890100	2892880	Bundle not that long ago that had a ton of them in it.
2892880	2895100	So I have a ton of tables thanks to that.
2895140	2897380	And that does me no good right now with the Switch version.
2897380	2900260	So if I want to play the tables, I'm going to have to re-buy it.
2900260	2905260	You know, I wonder if you have them on Humble if you go back on there, if they will have
2905260	2907980	Switch codes for them because Humble does that sometimes.
2907980	2908980	I doubt it.
2908980	2909980	It's too old at this point.
2909980	2911540	And this is too new as well.
2911540	2914220	That might be, but it's worth a shot anyway.
2914220	2915220	Yeah.
2915220	2920240	So, you know, but I also understand that, you know, many games, you know, you're not
2920240	2923140	going to be able to just carry your content from one platform to the other.
2923180	2927380	So I can't really like give the developers crap for that, but it's just, oh, that's
2927380	2933100	kind of a bummer that, you know, Pinball FX is a series that's been running on other platforms
2933100	2934100	so much longer.
2934100	2935820	I've been building up my collection there.
2935820	2939240	And it's kind of a bummer that I can't just import at least some of that.
2939240	2944860	I mean, if I can't bring over the licenses, then whatever, I kind of get that because
2944860	2946060	they have to pay a fee for that.
2946060	2950460	But at least the original tables created by the Pinball FX team, I would hope maybe some
2950460	2954300	more of those could come over, especially the older ones like Tesla and some of that.
2954300	2960580	Like I just, it would be nice, but I guess, I guess I can't really, I can't really fault
2960580	2961840	them too hard for that.
2961840	2967000	So and Bobby Black Wolf points out Rock Band DLC didn't go between Xbox and PlayStation.
2967000	2968000	They need their cut.
2968000	2969000	Yeah.
2969000	2972940	I mean, so it's like, I get it, but it is, well, but that also, okay, so you bring up
2972940	2974740	the Rock Band thing.
2974740	2981980	That also like made me buy Rock Band 4 on Xbox One, even though I probably have more
2981980	2986300	gaming stuff on PlayStation 4, but I wanted to carry my library over, right?
2986300	2989780	So I actually bought it on Xbox One so I could do that.
2989780	2993040	So you know, sometimes being able to carry your library over is cool.
2993040	2996220	And the thing about the Switch is that because of the vertical mode and the fact that it's
2996220	2998900	portable, it's probably the best version.
2998900	3002060	So that's why it's kind of a bummer that, oh, but I spent all that time building up
3002060	3003180	the PC collection.
3003180	3007140	So that's just, that's kind of where it's a little bit frustrating, but I'm not going
3007140	3014020	to be like angry tweets and all this stuff about it because yeah, logically I get it.
3014020	3017660	You know, they, they are in the business to make money and they don't make money by giving
3017660	3019460	everything away for free.
3019460	3022540	So there you go.
3022540	3028020	Over in chat, over at live.vognetwork.com, SSG100Matt says you can't buy those Star Wars
3028020	3031300	tables yet because Disney hasn't bought the company involved yet.
3031300	3033140	There you go.
3033140	3037420	Oh, Bobby does point out over at live.vognetwork.com that the two tables they're giving away for
3037420	3040940	free, it's on all platforms, not just Switch.
3040940	3045500	So I can go add those to my PC library and do that if I want to.
3045500	3048180	That might be fun.
3048180	3052980	Dark Tetsuya in chat says, I know a lot of the arcade Switch ports support the vertical
3052980	3053980	mode.
3053980	3057460	I think the NAGCO museum games that are oriented that way do.
3057900	3058900	Oh, that's really cool.
3058900	3059900	I didn't realize that.
3059900	3060900	I hope that's a trend.
3060900	3061900	They keep kind of going with that.
3061900	3062900	So that's neat.
3062900	3064460	Anyway, there it is.
3064460	3065700	That was my gaming week.
3065700	3069640	So yeah, pinball and World of Warcraft and some mobile phone games.
3069640	3075340	So anyway, housekeeping, we will not be here live over the next two weeks because next
3075340	3079620	Sunday is Christmas Eve and I have family plans as does Loki.
3079620	3081600	I think Jamie does too.
3081600	3083420	And then New Year's Eve.
3083420	3087000	I know y'all would love an OLR New Year's Eve countdown, but the reality is we have
3087040	3088960	other things we want to do.
3088960	3091640	So our next live show is going to be January 8th.
3091640	3092640	Oh, excuse me.
3092640	3094520	No, I'm looking at the, I'm looking at the wrong year.
3094520	3095520	Sorry.
3095520	3097360	January 7th will be the next live show.
3097360	3099120	So we'll see you then for that.
3099120	3102820	However, so that our podcast feed doesn't go too long without a little love.
3102820	3107060	We are going to do a show around New Year's Eve because we need to do the time capsule
3107060	3109400	stuff and we'll probably have some other surprises too.
3109400	3111340	So we will do a taped show.
3111340	3114960	We might broadcast that live on VOG, but if you want to find out when that's going to
3114960	3119760	be, you got to follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR because we haven't picked the exact
3119760	3120920	time yet.
3120920	3127000	But if I were going to bet money, I would say it's around noon on New Year's Eve, but
3127000	3133320	don't hold us to that until we announce it on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.
3133320	3138920	Also I know anime jam session is putting together some Christmasy stuff for the 25th.
3138920	3142280	I don't have the exact timeframe on when that's going to run yet, but stay tuned to our Twitter
3142280	3145120	at VOG network and you can find that out.
3145120	3152280	I know Rama is going to be doing some ho ho hoeing on the stream, uh, on the 25th.
3152280	3153280	So let's see.
3153280	3154280	Uh, that's it.
3154280	3156880	I have for housekeeping, so I guess we're going to get into some other gaming news and
3156880	3159040	looking ahead to 2018 here at the start.
3159040	3160040	Right?
3160040	3161040	Loki?
3161040	3162040	Yes, that's correct.
3162040	3167120	So already the registration for E3 2018 has gone public and so you can actually go register
3167120	3168160	because guess what?
3168160	3174440	It looks like they're allowing non-industry fans and gamers to buy tickets as well.
3174440	3180320	So they're going to be, um, sold in early bird and they also have regular tickets and
3180320	3185480	according to their FAQ it says E3 is now open to consumers and game enthusiasts on a limited
3185480	3187820	pass basis.
3187820	3189960	So that's disappointing.
3189960	3194640	Which means you're probably going to get more out of E3 by staying home because you won't
3194640	3195920	have to wait in line at home.
3195920	3196920	Yeah.
3196920	3202400	I mean recently with all this stuff, it's, it would be cool to play some of these games,
3202400	3204520	but this is not going to happen.
3204520	3210000	I mean, and honestly just to wait in lines to play demos for stuff, it's kind of neat
3210000	3211240	to be able to brag to people.
3211240	3213800	Yeah, I played that, but no one cares.
3213800	3214800	No one does.
3214800	3219460	And you probably learn more from just watching the press through, you know, the press conferences
3219460	3223320	and hearing the live streams and stuff that they do because you're going to be able to
3223320	3228960	see all that stuff in more detail than you can just, even if you go there as press and
3228960	3234000	then you're not like Nijin or something like that, you're going to get shunned off anyways
3234000	3236600	and you're going to have to wait, you know, make appointments to see all these people
3236600	3239780	to ask them the questions that they're not going to answer because they have.
3239780	3243900	That's what fucking killed E3 for me right there is the whole like making appointments
3243900	3247000	to see something that's going to be on YouTube anyway.
3247000	3248000	Why bother?
3248000	3249440	Yeah, there's no point.
3249440	3256280	So I just, I would probably want to take some time off to watch this stuff, um, because
3256280	3262100	it's fun and it's very distracting otherwise, but I mean, I kind of enjoy now watching the,
3262100	3265000	the press briefings and stuff and then there's, and it seems like each year there's more and
3265000	3267200	more companies not participating in E3.
3267200	3270760	So yeah, you know, who wants to deal with that kind of crap?
3270760	3275760	I'll be curious what they kind of do to develop the show for the public facing crowd, if anything,
3275760	3280040	like are they going to try to do more like, I don't know, the, the Nintendo world championships
3280040	3281040	type of thing.
3281040	3282040	Are you sports?
3282040	3283040	Yeah.
3283040	3285400	E-sports are they going to, what are they going to try to do to make it so that there's
3285400	3289320	more for the public to do if that makes sense?
3289320	3290320	I don't know.
3290320	3291320	I don't know.
3291320	3292320	So we'll see.
3292320	3295320	I mean, there's still some time to develop that cause we're still in 2017 but yeah, it
3295320	3297000	looks like they're going to go that same route again next year.
3297000	3299360	I mean, maybe they could do something that would get me excited about E3.
3299360	3303360	I'm not sure what that is, but yeah, I don't know what would really make me would say,
3303360	3306080	Oh my God, I really need to go.
3306080	3309680	I can't think of anything aside from like a new console launch.
3309680	3312480	Yeah, maybe that would like be like fucking revolutionary.
3312480	3314200	I have no reason to go.
3314200	3315200	Yeah.
3315200	3318760	I just, I, you know, I want to spend the money to go to smaller game shows where I can talk
3318760	3319760	directly to developers.
3319760	3320760	I'm still disappointed.
3320760	3324560	Like I kind of like how they did it and I understand you developing demos and stuff
3324560	3327800	is kind of hard, but you're making demos anyways for E3.
3327800	3332640	Like I kind of wish that they would do what they did in 2006 where they actually had like
3332640	3334640	demos for games like lost planet.
3334640	3335640	They had a demo though.
3335640	3338920	Hey, here's our press conference and now you can play the demo.
3338920	3340640	It's like E3 at home type thing.
3340640	3343400	Like I wish they would just do that to a limited extent.
3343400	3347240	Like, okay, Hey, we've got these games that were shown off on the floor and you know,
3347240	3350600	maybe it's not necessarily like big games.
3350600	3351800	It could be indie games even.
3351800	3357280	I mean just something different.
3357280	3361200	Bobby Black Wolf in chat says last year the exhibitors weren't told that it was open to
3361200	3363400	the public until six weeks beforehand.
3363400	3365460	They were not prepared for the crowd this year.
3365460	3366460	They will be.
3366460	3369520	So that could be interesting to see how that dynamic kind of changes things a little bit
3369520	3372360	with the preparation having this much time to put into it.
3372360	3373360	It's true.
3373360	3374360	We'll see.
3374360	3375360	Yeah.
3375360	3376980	They will be trying to throw things together like they were last time.
3376980	3379600	So JD, what about you?
3379600	3383920	We're all bitter bitches apparently here at OLR, but you've, you've never been to E3.
3383920	3384920	Do you have any interest?
3384920	3389880	Well, I mean, I kind of did like 10 years ago because it was all like anyone could talk
3389880	3390880	about.
3391560	3397320	I'm kind of like, eh, I don't really like, I'm honestly only interested in the Nintendo
3397320	3399180	news most of the time anyway.
3399180	3403240	So like it doesn't seem like it'd be worth it to, you know, pay a big fee to go see everything.
3403240	3406680	And if I'm only going to go to one area, um, I don't know.
3406680	3410720	I feel like the trend is each of the major publishers is doing their own thing.
3410720	3412000	Like Nintendo has their thing.
3412000	3413800	Sony has the PlayStation experience.
3413800	3416200	Like that just seems to be the way things are going.
3416200	3418640	So why go to E3?
3418640	3422640	I, and you know what, if I want to go to the LA convention center, I'll just go one month
3422640	3426560	before and go to drag con because at least at drag con I can get a picture with Tyra
3426560	3427560	Sanchez.
3427560	3428560	No waiting.
3428560	3429920	So, well, you can do that anywhere.
3429920	3433800	Tyra Sanchez is, um, I mean that's, that's kind of a lot of it.
3433800	3438280	It's like if, if E3 were held in the city that I live in, I might actually care more,
3438280	3439840	but I have to go to SoCal for that.
3439840	3441320	And that's just, that's effort.
3441320	3443200	And if I'm going to go, I'm going to go for something else.
3443200	3445680	SoCal driving to SoCal is effort.
3445680	3446680	It is.
3446720	3451040	I don't, I don't drive, so I'd have to, you know, take Amtrak or whatever, or just hit
3451040	3452040	your ride.
3452040	3453040	It convinced me.
3453040	3454920	It's a good idea and hit your ride.
3454920	3456600	That's is that a precedent you want to set?
3456600	3457600	Maybe not.
3457600	3458600	Yes, Jamie.
3458600	3459600	I'm going to drag con.
3459600	3460600	Yup.
3460600	3461600	There you go.
3461600	3462600	No.
3462600	3463600	All right.
3463600	3464600	Uh, moving on.
3464600	3467360	Let's talk, uh, about Soul Calibur six.
3467360	3470640	This is now, this is a game that might be at E3 that I would be excited to actually
3470640	3473240	play, but you know, I, or I could just wait until it comes out.
3473240	3476360	Soul Calibur is such a tech and clone.
3476360	3481200	Soul Calibur six, uh, had some more revealed in Famitsu to talk about what's going to be
3481200	3482600	in Soul Calibur six.
3482600	3484540	There was a translation that was done.
3484540	3488480	They say the development is about 70% and they're talking reboot.
3488480	3489860	Oh boy.
3489860	3492600	And that will be reflected in the game's story mode.
3492600	3497040	Uh, there will be some new characters and classic characters, but you also get guest
3497040	3498040	characters.
3498040	3501280	Although of course they're not saying who the guest characters are at this point, but
3501280	3502760	we had some of those early rumors, right?
3502760	3507080	Weren't they talking about like fire emblem characters on Nintendo and yeah, I just hope
3507080	3510200	they bring link back if it's on the switch cause he was in Soul Calibur two.
3510200	3511200	Is it on the switch?
3511200	3512200	I can't remember.
3512200	3513200	I don't know if it is.
3513200	3514200	I know it's PS4 and Xbox one for sure.
3514200	3515200	I can't remember.
3515200	3516200	Well they better put it on the switch cause everything needs to be on the switch.
3516200	3517200	I don't know though.
3517200	3521080	It's gotta be dad Kratos.
3521080	3522320	It might be daddy Kratos.
3522320	3523320	Who knows?
3523320	3528560	Uh, anyway, also coming back, a critical edge attacks with single button activation, uh,
3528560	3529560	soul charge.
3529560	3532080	You can meet or burn in order to do certain attack properties.
3532080	3535520	Uh, the character creation mode is set to return.
3535520	3536520	Yay.
3536520	3538680	What about armor breaking?
3538680	3539960	I want to know for Kelek.
3539960	3543160	I mean, I don't think they're saying that yet.
3543160	3546960	So, uh, and dark Tetsuya says, uh, it has not been announced for switch at least for
3546960	3548120	the VGA trailer.
3548120	3550980	And probably it's just one of those things where now the switches power is holding it
3550980	3551980	back a little bit.
3551980	3552980	So we'll see.
3552980	3556720	Uh, anyhow, also something to consider about Soul Calibur six.
3556720	3558760	Uh, I mentioned it is kind of a reboot.
3558760	3562280	It is going to take place during the events of the first game.
3562280	3568000	So you are revisiting the events of the original Soul Calibur to uncover hidden truths.
3568000	3569000	So kind of interesting.
3569000	3573720	I don't know if they're doing like a mortal combat nine type of thing where they're like
3573720	3577000	revisiting the same story, but they didn't call it just Soul Calibur.
3577000	3578200	They're calling it Soul Calibur six.
3578200	3581160	All I have to say about that is reboot.
3581160	3583480	Wasn't there like also soul edge before Soul Calibur?
3583480	3585160	Like there's a complicated story.
3585160	3589240	It is a complicated story and, and, uh, and some of the characters then kind of share
3589240	3591720	with other, like they come, they come from Tekken and shit.
3591720	3593600	So dude, it's a fighting game.
3593600	3595680	There doesn't need to be a storyline, you know, she meets you.
3595680	3601600	But then later guest characters, like soul edge was the one that came out on PlayStation
3601600	3604080	and then soul blazer had nothing to do with any of those games.
3604080	3605080	That was super Nintendo game.
3605080	3606080	It was awesome.
3606080	3611120	Soul Calibur was the now me hardware series.
3611120	3612640	So anyway, uh, yes.
3612640	3617440	And this other article I'm looking at is confirming PlayStation four, Xbox one and PC next year.
3617440	3618440	Not the switch.
3618440	3619440	Sorry, JD.
3619440	3620440	But you never know.
3620440	3622360	I'll always hold out hope.
3622360	3623640	You never know what will happen.
3623640	3625360	The soul still burns.
3625360	3626920	All right.
3626920	3628680	Uh, dark soccer.
3628680	3629680	What do you have for us?
3629680	3631640	Oh, some stuff.
3631640	3634120	Basically modders gonna mod, right?
3634120	3639640	So of course there, um, have already modded, you know, breath of the wild further, you
3639640	3640640	know, things.
3640680	3645320	Like in all kinds of weird outfits with, you know, key blades and shit dong mod.
3645320	3656680	Well, they've, there's a mod now that changes his bike to a Sonic running well, cause you
3656680	3657920	got to go fast.
3657920	3662600	Link writing Sonic is the fanfic I never knew I needed.
3662600	3668800	And then there's one that I guess turns them into Sanchez from GTA.
3668800	3672520	It's a CJ right in a Sanchez with, uh, forget the guy.
3672520	3673520	Okay.
3673520	3676000	Cause I didn't catch the train CJ.
3676000	3680880	Oh, and then there's the road runner.
3680880	3681880	That's pretty cool.
3681880	3682880	Do you get to that now?
3682880	3683880	That's what they should do.
3683880	3687120	They should make a video game that's like Zelda breath of the wild, but it's the road
3687120	3692480	runner killing a Wiley coyote in all sorts of strange and mysterious ways on the one
3692480	3697440	does this too, but it's like the there's like feet wheels.
3697440	3701600	And so it looks really cartoony and it works well, it's in motion, but it's just like,
3701600	3705040	he's got like wheels made out of feet.
3705040	3706040	It's just crazy.
3706040	3707560	Isn't that kind of what Sonic has?
3707560	3709320	Well, I'm looking at the road runner one.
3709320	3711040	Oh, well they have the road runner one.
3711040	3712040	Road runner.
3712040	3713360	Maybe look at that.
3713360	3717760	You know, there was a road runner video game back in the days of the Atari game.
3717760	3718760	A couple.
3718760	3722760	There was actually also one on super Nintendo that ironically enough was very much like
3722760	3723840	Sonic the hedgehog.
3723840	3727040	The Sonic one looks better cause he's got like his hands behind him.
3727040	3731360	Like he's doing his real fast run that the road runner one was just fucking weird.
3731360	3735880	Cause when I got my super Nintendo, I was like, do I want Mario brothers?
3735880	3736880	No.
3736880	3737880	Fuck that.
3737880	3738880	I want road runners.
3738880	3739880	Death Valley rally.
3739880	3740880	Fuck.
3740880	3741880	Yeah.
3741880	3742880	No.
3742880	3743880	Apparently Mario brothers.
3743880	3744880	It was like $90.
3744880	3745880	It was like, it was expensive.
3745880	3748320	Um, cause I bought it used, I bought all that stuff used.
3748320	3749320	I don't know why.
3749320	3753040	For some reason I, I would have probably gotten super Mario world.
3753040	3755000	Maybe it was because I was smart and new.
3755000	3756400	Hey, I have lots of friends.
3756400	3758640	They have super Nintendo's and they have that.
3758640	3762200	We'll just borrow each other's games cause that's what we used to do.
3762200	3767160	And so I got red runners, death Valley rally, and it is very much like a Sonic game.
3767160	3768160	Okay.
3768160	3771520	And kind of, isn't that also one of the hardest games to emulate?
3771520	3773340	I don't know, but it's a pretty hard game.
3773340	3777080	I think road runner is a, there's something about like the boxes don't show up in one
3777080	3778080	of the levels.
3778080	3782640	Like it's a very rare type of super Nintendo thing or maybe I'm confusing it with an NES
3782640	3783640	game.
3783640	3784640	I think it is.
3784640	3785640	Yeah.
3785880	3787240	And it's not that it's, you know, there's where they say emulators can always pull it
3787240	3788240	off perfectly.
3788240	3791320	So, all right, well that'd be fun.
3791320	3792320	Dark soccer.
3792320	3794760	Any interest in modding your breath of the wild for anything?
3794760	3795760	No.
3795760	3799760	I mean you basically, it's all just with um, uh, an emulator anyway.
3799760	3800760	Hmm.
3800760	3802080	I guess that's true.
3802080	3806200	So, which the thing I like about watching other people do that is they'll like watching
3806200	3812000	like the, the map zooms and how far out the maps go to see how the game's constructed.
3812000	3815320	All right, let's move on Loki.
3815320	3820360	So this isn't really a ton of news, but Obsidian is basically saying that their next game that
3820360	3824820	they're working on will not have microtransactions of any kind.
3824820	3827800	Now, they're basically saying that...
3827800	3829200	That's kind of great news, actually.
3829200	3837000	Well, no, no, I understand that, but it does set an interesting precedent that these, obviously,
3837000	3842520	publishers out there are aware of the situation and the gamers' views on microtransactions
3842520	3847520	to where they feel it's necessary to come out and make a statement like this, saying
3847520	3851360	that, hey, listen, we're not going to have any of that crap.
3851360	3859320	So they're basically showing off, I guess, it's some new project they haven't really
3859320	3864160	said yet, but it's going to be in conjunction with Private Division, which I guess is Take
3864160	3868800	Two's new publishing label, and it's going to be an RPG of some sort, which I guess makes
3868800	3873000	sense because it is Obsidian.
3873000	3876360	So yeah, I'm glad to see that they're not going to try to shoehorn that in like they
3876360	3880840	did with Middle-earth Shadow of War.
3880840	3885160	And you know that when you buy the game, you will have the game.
3885160	3886160	That's it.
3886160	3888200	Unless there's a season pass, because there's no...
3888200	3890680	It doesn't say anything about that.
3890680	3893000	Mega-transactions are still okay.
3893000	3897000	Season passes, eh, eh, eh, that's fine, DLC is fine.
3897000	3898000	But you know what?
3898040	3903200	It's an RPG, usually RPGs are pretty meaty as it is, I don't feel that it's necessarily
3903200	3904200	a bad thing.
3904200	3909340	But do you think, on average, people spend more on a mega-transaction DLC package, or
3909340	3914920	on individual micro-transactions that they continuously buy?
3914920	3917240	I don't know, see, for me, I only buy the big stuff.
3917240	3919600	I don't like to buy the little stuff.
3919600	3921600	Every gamer's different.
3921600	3926200	I wonder what it's like in the statistical sense, like, how much does killing micro-transactions
3926200	3928040	actually cost them money?
3928040	3932240	Well, I know it's like, I don't really play a lot of games that have micro-transactions.
3932240	3937200	The only thing that I can think of that sorta did, and I thought it was absolutely ridiculous,
3937200	3942880	was actually Saints Row the 3rd or the 4th, actually probably both of them, where they
3942880	3947840	had a fuck-ton of, like, cosmetic DLC that really didn't fucking do anything.
3947840	3949880	It was just all cosmetics.
3949880	3953840	And that was pretty cheap, but it was still like a micro-transaction, whereas they had
3953840	3959040	DLC content for it that added new weapons and new modes and stuff like that, and extended
3959040	3960480	the story a little bit.
3960480	3964560	That I purchased, the other cosmetic stuff, I was like, fuck that shit, I'm not playing
3964560	3965560	that.
3965560	3969200	Well, it kinda also goes back to, let's say, the granddaddy of this whole fucking thing.
3969200	3974760	Going back to Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion, and horse armor, versus, you know...
3974760	3975760	Knights of the Nine.
3975760	3976760	Yeah, exactly.
3976760	3981640	The vampire mod, or the expansion, that was actually Skyrim, but you know what I mean!
3981640	3985440	All those, like, full quest lines and stuff that were fleshed out there.
3985440	3986440	Yes.
3986440	3990800	And I mean, at least to their credit for Oblivion, they had a ton of expansions, and even some
3990800	3992240	I think were free.
3992240	3998640	So I know at least some came free on demo-dis that were with the Xbox Magazine or whatever,
3998640	3999640	so hell yes.
3999640	4000640	Hell yes.
4000640	4006160	Alright, moving on, let's talk a little bit about Destiny 2, speaking about money.
4006160	4009960	Because Curse of Osiris actually launched, I totally forgot that that was, god, I feel
4009960	4013920	like the PC version just came out, and now here we are already on an expansion, but the
4013920	4016960	PC one was delayed a little bit, so there you go.
4016960	4022480	Anyway, originally, vanilla players in Curse of Osiris were kinda walled off from key content,
4022480	4027200	meaning like, weekly endgame stuff, and things that you need for trophies and achievements.
4027200	4030640	So as you can imagine, the community was like, fuck you greedy bastards!
4030640	4032800	I'm paraphrasing, but that's basically what it was.
4032800	4038920	Apparently though, they are listening, and with the next Destiny 2 update, 1.1.1, many
4038920	4042640	of these changes are going to be reversed, access to endgame content will be available
4042640	4046400	for those who haven't purchased Curse of Osiris.
4046400	4050560	That update is scheduled to have already gone out, so it went out this past week already,
4050560	4054280	so hopefully that is doing well for the players, they did have to take the game down for seven
4054280	4057840	hours to fix that, so, good.
4057840	4062480	So now if I decide to play more Destiny 2, I'm not forced to buy this Curse of Osiris
4062480	4066200	to figure out what the endgame is all about, because I did play Destiny 2 up to like level
4066200	4068280	10, and then I was like, ooh shiny!
4068280	4069500	And I played other games.
4069500	4075040	But that's very typical for me in video games, is that, you know, unless it's an MMO or a
4075040	4079640	multiplayer or something, I get which, funny enough, Destiny is kinda both those things,
4079640	4082480	but I still get sidetracked with other stuff.
4082480	4084920	I tend to go where the people I know are playing.
4084920	4088260	And I didn't know a lot of people playing Destiny 2 on PC, sadly.
4088260	4089260	Just like, one.
4089260	4090260	No, two.
4090260	4095000	I played with our mutual friend, Crystal.
4095000	4099820	I played on that, and then my buddy Delvin from Video Game Realness was the only other
4099820	4103920	person I think I played Destiny 2 online with, so, that's it.
4103920	4106820	Alright, more stories, Dark Sakura.
4106820	4110040	This made me happy, and I wish I could play some of the music from the trailer, because
4110040	4112940	it just made me super happy.
4112940	4120820	But there's a new trailer for Dragon Ball FighterZ, and it's set to We Were Angels,
4120820	4127500	which was the ending theme for Dragon Ball Z in its original run from 1993 to 1996.
4127500	4134340	God, I can't believe that people didn't get that part of the series until 2001 here.
4134340	4137860	That's crazy, just how far behind we were on it.
4137860	4145240	But at any rate, it also shows some other fighters that are gonna be in there.
4145240	4153200	So it brings Hit, Beerus, and Goku Black to the series, so that's gonna be pretty cool.
4153200	4157740	It looks like it just really kind of does that Xenoverse thing where it replays past
4157740	4159400	fights and everything.
4159400	4163060	And I think it's gonna be really fun, I'm looking forward to it.
4163060	4168360	But I hope, though, if we get some of the super characters, that we then get Cabba and
4168360	4171840	Caulifla and all them, because they're fun, too.
4171840	4175080	Alright, you're definitely checking this game out when it comes out, right?
4175080	4176080	No shit.
4176080	4177080	Yeah, I know.
4177080	4178480	It's on your must-have list.
4178480	4181080	Yeah, it's on my Jamie want list.
4181080	4185480	Alright, just a few more stories for you guys, and then Jamie will want to pick a classic
4185480	4186480	game for you all.
4186480	4187480	The last one of the year.
4187480	4188480	The last one of the year.
4188480	4189480	Maybe.
4189480	4190480	No, it is.
4190480	4192940	Well, no, because there might be a New Year's Eve one.
4192940	4193940	So maybe.
4193940	4194940	Maybe.
4194940	4197520	It might be your last pick, but we're waiting to see how that works out.
4197520	4198520	I picked a good one.
4198520	4199520	What?
4199520	4200520	I picked a good one, though.
4200520	4201520	You did pick a good one.
4201520	4202520	Alright.
4202520	4203520	Until we get to that moment, though, we have a couple more stories.
4203520	4204520	Loki.
4204960	4208040	This has been a game that has been removed from Steam.
4208040	4211920	How horrible must it be that it got removed from Steam, because there's a whole lot of
4211920	4216400	horrible shit on Steam right now, and it's quite amazing that all of that's still there.
4216400	4219680	Well, apparently there's a game actually called Shit on Steam.
4219680	4220680	No, it was not.
4220680	4228440	It was called You Must Be 18 or Older to Enter, and it's basically, they call it basically
4228440	4232120	a simulator.
4232120	4237080	It's simulating being underage and looking at porn websites in the early parts of the
4237080	4238080	Internet.
4238080	4239080	Wow.
4239080	4241240	And so, well, it's all ASCII.
4241240	4243120	Like all of the art is ASCII.
4243120	4244680	Did you say ass-y?
4244680	4245680	It's all ass-y?
4245680	4249680	Well, ironically, you should say that because the image that they show on the screen isn't
4249680	4251320	ASCII and it is of an ass.
4251320	4256840	So I mean, it sort of does make, you know, there is a pun there, but yes, it's basically
4256840	4263400	it's you explore a series of lo-fi websites, they say, as a first-time porn liker.
4263400	4264400	And then...
4264400	4266960	This is like playing strip poker on the Commodore 64.
4266960	4273880	To recreate the isolated disorientation, they said that you have to also, like, basically
4273880	4278840	you have to deal with pop-ups that make loud noises and different, like, other jump scares
4278840	4282640	and you have to look behind you, that type of stuff, you know, making sure that your
4282640	4284160	parents aren't walking up on it.
4284160	4290680	But anyway, so they got, the developer that made this game, got an email from Valve basically
4290680	4292600	saying your game's been banned from Steam.
4292600	4297280	Of course, you know, he then wrote back saying, well, there's been other games that have had
4297280	4300200	way more, you know, explicit stuff.
4300200	4304040	Like for example, let's talk about Saints Row again, Saints Row the Third had a whole
4304040	4310200	scene where you fight through naked in a BDSM club and it had a giant fucking dickbat, okay?
4310200	4312580	There's a giant fucking dildo bat.
4312580	4314040	That was true.
4314040	4316480	That was a microtransaction worth the purchase.
4316480	4317480	No, it actually wasn't.
4317480	4319000	And you can get one for real.
4319000	4321120	You can get one for real.
4321120	4322880	Yeah, just check your local good vibrations.
4322880	4325640	Yeah, look forward to the upcoming DDR tournament.
4325640	4327720	The Retain 13 Jamie and I are gonna do.
4327720	4331400	So yeah, basically, you know, Valve banned the game.
4331400	4336080	They basically, you know, he claims that, you know, it's been more explicit or anything
4336080	4341680	and a lot of the stuff out there is more explicit than you must be 18 or older to enter.
4341680	4343800	But no one else seemed to care.
4343800	4349240	And on top of that, you know, they even tried to, um, I guess blur some of the images and
4349240	4352860	stuff even a little bit more, but it still wasn't enough.
4352860	4356880	And they just kind of want to know what exactly are the rules in for this?
4356880	4361620	Because it seems like you're offering different standards depending on the game or publisher.
4361620	4362840	What am I allowed to show?
4362840	4363840	What am I not?
4363840	4364840	Do I get to show titty?
4364840	4366640	Do I get to show?
4366640	4371000	There's like, like indie games though that have, they're on Steam.
4371000	4372000	Shower with your dad simulator.
4372000	4373000	Shower with your dad.
4373000	4378360	See, we have a perfect example or like even like, um, fucking, there's other games out
4378360	4382380	there that have like, you know, bare chested women and stuff, or even there's like Japanese
4382380	4385600	games out there and you squirt women down and their clothes come off and stuff like
4385600	4386600	that.
4386600	4387600	What was the game you were playing?
4387600	4388600	I think this is years ago.
4388600	4391480	You're actually playing it during OLR and it was a game about like you rotated the breasts
4391480	4392480	in different directions.
4392480	4395880	Oh, I don't know what that was, but that was like a little flash game that someone made.
4395880	4396880	That was funny.
4396880	4399280	It was, it was like, it was like a rhythm game.
4400000	4402720	And you slap the breasts and use the rhythm method.
4402720	4405520	And so they have like different moves that you have to do.
4405520	4409080	So they had like, you had to bounce the tits up and down, you had to swing them side to
4409080	4411320	side and you had to spin them around.
4411320	4416480	And based on, on that, you know, there's, you had to do all those moves to, you know,
4416480	4420040	take out the different things coming up before they hit the top of the screen.
4420040	4422120	And so it was like, it was silly.
4422120	4427080	But um, you know, something like they have stuff out there that is violating these rules
4427080	4428080	as it is.
4428080	4429080	And it's kind of unfair.
4429080	4436040	They pick on this guy that really, dude, I mean, it's, it's very basic ASCII art.
4436040	4439160	Rage Nator points out genital jousting and mount your friends.
4439160	4440160	Yes, exactly.
4440160	4441560	Genital jousting.
4441560	4447400	It's fucking dicks, big fucking dicks in the game, floppy dicks.
4447400	4452000	Is it because maybe this is an indie game that hasn't maybe was genital jousting rated
4452000	4457120	by the ESRB and no one couldn't have because that would have been an AO game.
4457120	4458120	I do.
4458120	4460240	I think genital jousting is banned from Twitch for what it's worth.
4460240	4461240	Yeah, it is.
4461240	4464160	But seriously though, genital jousting, okay.
4464160	4469000	ASCII art, which barely looks like anything and not even really, it's just kind of like,
4469000	4474640	this is supposed to be porn, but it's not really porn and that's not okay.
4474640	4475640	Obviously different standards.
4475640	4479080	It's, it's a little surprising to me because I got recommended a lot of dating sim games
4479080	4483400	that were very straight and I don't know how graphic they were, but like the way they were
4483400	4486920	advertised, it's like, it looks like you're going to see stuff.
4486920	4487920	And those are on steam.
4487920	4492520	Like those are actually like actually marketed at me because I played a gay dating sim, you
4492520	4494280	know, because they have terrible algorithms.
4494280	4498760	So, but that's kind of surprising that it's just ASCII art and they're saying that's too
4498760	4499760	explicit.
4499760	4501960	It's not even like really good ASCII art.
4501960	4506120	It's like, it's sort of, it looks, I mean like this picture, you can tell it's supposed
4506120	4512240	to be like a guy with like someone bent over him, but like it's black and white and it's
4512240	4513240	ASCII art.
4513240	4516880	And then they have like a little like add to the side that it sorta looks like a woman's
4516880	4520240	profile, but it's fucking ASCII art.
4520240	4521240	But it might be a dude.
4521240	4522240	Okay.
4522240	4526220	But I've got to ask this question shouldn't be important, but it might be, is it primarily
4526220	4528840	gay content or is it straight content or is it both?
4528840	4529840	I don't know.
4529840	4530840	Sometimes that makes a difference.
4530840	4531840	It doesn't really say.
4531840	4535360	It says you have, they have like, I don't really understand what the game is.
4535360	4541800	So it says you guys, you, you take more mental notes and it says orgy German milf, anal,
4541800	4542800	and your type.
4542800	4546860	And then they have orgy German milf or anal and you, I mean, if it's milf, it's straight
4546860	4553420	but like there's a history of gay adult content getting censored more judiciously than straight
4553420	4555380	like, okay, like I'll show you the screenshot here.
4555380	4558940	It's like, it's really stupid.
4558940	4562540	Like that's, that's in a high quality ASCII art.
4562540	4568980	On the flip side though, this game is now getting more publicity than it would have
4568980	4569980	ever got before.
4569980	4572980	So I would hope that this game is available on itch.io or something because like seriously
4572980	4577140	right now, like I see people in chat going, I should check this out.
4577140	4581100	Or this game looks hilarious and it's like, we would have never talked about this game
4581100	4583220	if Steam hadn't abandoned it.
4583220	4586820	So I almost feel like this, these developers should just fucking embrace the too hot for
4586820	4592780	Steam thing and you're going to sell tons or tons more than you were going to before.
4592780	4595860	You already have your fucking credit cards on file with a lot of these things.
4595860	4600540	I mean, just put a credit card on file to assert that you're over 18 and then let the
4600540	4601540	porn flow.
4601980	4604140	Let the porn flow.
4604140	4609920	So I'll just point out that the gay dating sim I played, um, did have a censored release
4609920	4614120	on Steam because they have to, to get around the content filter, but there's also easily
4614120	4619340	unofficial patches where you can put the standalone adult content back in the game.
4619340	4622340	So they, but it sounds like it's difficult to do that with a game built around ASCII
4622340	4625060	art cause it's rendering text instead of inserting images.
4625060	4626060	Huh?
4626060	4627060	I don't know.
4627060	4628060	Yeah.
4628580	4632340	But anyway, let's wait six months for Valve to see the bad publicity and look at all the
4632340	4636020	money from people buying it that could have been on Steam and reverse their decision.
4636020	4638620	Like, I don't know if they were charging for it though.
4638620	4641660	Oh, if it's a free game, then they're probably less.
4641660	4642660	There's less you can get away with.
4642660	4645300	Should we invite these guys on the show to talk about porn?
4645300	4646300	Yes.
4646300	4656300	So yeah, the game it's, it's James Earl Cox, the third, Joe Cox and Julian, Julie, uh,
4656300	4663300	you can in are the people who made it guys, I swear to God.
4663300	4664300	Love it.
4664300	4665300	All right.
4665300	4667900	Like they even have, like, it's supposed to be an AOL welcome screen and it's like, do
4667900	4668900	your search.
4668900	4671500	You search for porn, people doing it.
4671500	4672500	Sex or fourth base.
4672500	4673500	Wait.
4673500	4676060	So it simulates AOL chat rooms from like the nineties.
4676060	4677420	Well, it's all in ASCII art.
4677420	4678420	What a throwback.
4678420	4680460	I'd have to be like through a terminal or something.
4680460	4681460	All right.
4681460	4685460	Let's, let's take a trip down memory lane when yes, please.
4685460	4689820	Adult games were sold at adult stores and they were like legendary and it's like your
4689820	4692220	uncle had a friend who had it, but they really didn't.
4692220	4693620	You just made that up.
4693620	4697700	Oh, so I did find the link to the game, so I will link it in the chat room because it's
4697700	4698700	on itch.io.
4698700	4699700	I knew it.
4699700	4700700	There you go.
4700700	4701700	And they're going to,
4701700	4702700	Oh, I don't know.
4702700	4703700	It's tough.
4703700	4704700	Oh, it's actually really neat.
4704700	4705700	Little indie store.
4705700	4706700	Check it out.
4706700	4707700	It's cool.
4707700	4708700	There's lots of free games on it too.
4708700	4709700	I try not to spend money, but I will.
4709700	4710700	There's a pay what you want a lot of times.
4710700	4711700	Okay.
4711700	4720780	Look, here's back when you had to pay $90, 50 bucks or actually, no, I think tonight's
4720780	4723140	game, you had to pay like 200 bucks for it.
4723140	4726140	The classic game of the week, dark soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and
4726140	4732780	find a game that she thinks, Hey, put down your porn and play this quality fapping.
4732780	4735220	Stop fapping, put away the Crisco.
4735220	4736220	Start yapping.
4736220	4737220	All right.
4737220	4738220	Dark soccer.
4738220	4739220	What is the game of the week?
4739740	4747140	I've already done blazing star, but pull star is one of my favorite, um, side schooling
4747140	4748140	shooters.
4748140	4753540	It is, it was published by SNK, Neo Geo, Neo Geo CD and arcade.
4753540	4756860	And as I said, it was the predecessor of blazing star.
4756860	4761460	It was also the first Neo Geo game to incorporate pre-rendered graphics.
4761460	4763940	Um, it had, I finally have some music.
4763940	4766940	Well, that's why I gave you the minute mark.
4767660	4774620	Well, you know what, anyway, um, it was also re-released in 2017 under the arcade archives
4774620	4779340	that were developed by hamster corporation for PS4 and Xbox one.
4779340	4783060	Um, it is a super fun game.
4783060	4787900	Um, basically you have different, you know, types of spacecraft to choose from.
4787900	4790020	You get different power ups.
4790020	4795940	And um, the thing that I liked about it is that it did resemble a good bit of R-type
4795940	4799620	with, you know, the way that your power ups works and everything.
4799620	4804780	This looks a lot like Gradius 2, like what I'm looking at is a lot like Gradius 2 with
4804780	4805780	the fire.
4805780	4809820	It definitely took its homage, you know, like I could play burning heat in the background
4809820	4812780	and I would think it's Gradius 2, but anyway, no, it looks cool though.
4812780	4816020	It definitely looks like a, like a, an evolved form of it.
4816020	4818020	Like not to, not to knock the game cause it looks sweet.
4818020	4822700	Well, it certainly though is, I would say a, um, a product of its time.
4822700	4826180	It came out in 1995 originally.
4826180	4832500	So it has that nineties anime character styling, you know, where the, the bangs were just,
4832500	4835540	you know, unbelievably set aside and tall.
4835540	4838900	Um, but it's really is a very fun shooter.
4838900	4841380	It has, you know, different, uh, voices that go on it.
4841380	4849420	The most of the visuals are, uh, 3d pre-rendered, um, with a full cut scenes and a pre-rendered
4849420	4850820	movies.
4850820	4856020	And you also, uh, once you have your power ups, you get a small orb hanging out on your
4856020	4861740	butt and it can be used to, um, absorb or deflect fire.
4861740	4869180	Kind of like how, um, the, uh, the one from R-Type is, the little add on thing.
4869180	4876860	Um, but Pole Star is, I mean, it really did get some mixed reviews, either people super
4876860	4879580	loved it or they super hated it.
4879580	4885220	Um, it across the board, it was, um, you know, people liked the graphics, but still a lot
4885220	4889140	of people said that it just didn't seem very original, you know, and I don't care what
4889140	4891660	any of those people think because they're wrong.
4891660	4897740	Um, Pole Star is one of, I would say the best Neo Geo games.
4897740	4900260	Blazing Star is better.
4900260	4904820	Don't get me wrong, but Pole Star is a really, really good game.
4904820	4908180	And it's one that I think a lot of people, you know, if you haven't played it, you're
4908180	4909180	missing out.
4909180	4911180	So there you go.
4911180	4915580	Put that quote on the back of the box, if you haven't played it, you're missing out.
4915580	4916580	Classic game of the week.
4916580	4917580	Pole Star.
4917580	4919580	If you haven't played it, why?
4919580	4922220	Well, to be fair, Neo Geos are kind of expensive.
4922220	4924300	And it just got a, it got a PS4.
4924300	4925300	That is true.
4925300	4930340	Although I've understood though that for some of the Neo Geo collections out there, um,
4930340	4933500	watch out for the emulation cause some of them have some weird artifacting.
4933500	4934500	Just saying.
4934500	4935500	Yeah.
4936100	4942660	And if somebody wants to find me a Blazing Star cartridge for my Neo Geo at home, I wouldn't
4942660	4943660	say no.
4943660	4945500	That would be a great Hanukkah present.
4945500	4946500	It would.
4946500	4948260	I need that for Jumis.
4948260	4949260	All right.
4949260	4953180	Well, we're going to take a quick break here, but when we come back, there is plenty more
4953180	4956100	Orange Lounge Radio to come, including your emails.
4956100	4958460	If we have any this week, we actually might not.
4958460	4962620	Also we're going to get to the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
4962620	4965120	And we'll talk a little bit about news with the Xbox.
4965120	4967180	We'll talk about a big lawsuit going on.
4967180	4968680	Somebody posted about that to Discord.
4968680	4972840	We'll talk about that, which, Ooh, by the way, join our Discord, uh, vognetwork.com
4972840	4973840	slash Discord.
4973840	4977480	Uh, and, and most importantly, we'll talk about the Golden Girls.
4977480	4981240	When we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4987680	4990860	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
4990860	4996940	Live tonight, episode number 711 already in progress for this December the 17th of
4996940	4997940	2017.
4997940	5003880	It is the last Orange Lounge Radio of the year, sad face, but you know, we have holidays
5003880	5004880	coming up.
5004880	5005880	So happy face, I guess.
5005880	5006880	All right.
5006880	5010380	So anyway, uh, let's get into this here.
5010380	5014820	This is something where, um, we actually have another present here in studio.
5014820	5018060	This one, I believe, I don't know if your cat is a gift.
5018060	5019060	I don't.
5019060	5020060	Oh, Mr. Smoosh.
5020140	5021140	Mr. Smoosh to humanity.
5021140	5022420	He is actually like the best holiday gift.
5022420	5024180	He's a precious little chocolate cinnamon roll.
5024180	5025180	Yeah, he's great.
5025180	5026180	Except for when he tries to...
5026180	5027780	Especially because his face looks like a cinnamon roll.
5027780	5030060	Especially when he tries to claw things that aren't his.
5030060	5032200	That's when he's not so precious, but that's all right.
5032200	5037020	So anyway, um, so I believe this box in studio here is from actdeft.
5037020	5042940	So we could JD, I asked JD to open it so that all we had to do is take the cover off and
5042940	5043940	see what it is.
5043940	5044940	So let's do it.
5044940	5045940	Open it.
5045940	5046940	Oh shit.
5046940	5047940	Fuck me.
5047940	5048940	What is this?
5048940	5049940	Like cereal?
5050820	5051820	What is this?
5051820	5053820	You said something about this on a previous episode.
5053820	5055740	Oh yes.
5055740	5064900	He actually sent us hazelnut Oreos from Mexico, which I believe came up in a prior episode
5064900	5065900	of the show.
5065900	5066900	He sent me some before too.
5066900	5067900	Oh my God.
5067900	5068900	These are going to be great.
5068900	5069900	What a nice boy.
5069900	5071700	And he says, this is the last week I can eat sweets like this.
5071700	5074860	He sent four boxes so we can each take one.
5074860	5076660	I guess you get a Christmas gift too, JD.
5076660	5077660	How about that?
5077660	5078660	You can thank actdeft for that.
5078660	5079660	How about that?
5080380	5081380	Or maybe it was supposed to be for Alan.
5081380	5082380	I don't know.
5082380	5083380	I mean, if it'll fit in my backpack.
5083380	5084380	Sure.
5084380	5085380	There you go.
5085380	5086380	Otherwise we'll just give it to Alan.
5086380	5087380	I'll fit this in my mouth.
5087380	5088380	All right.
5088380	5089380	I'm looking at it right now.
5089380	5090380	Watch me.
5090380	5091380	Watch me.
5091380	5092380	Thank you actdeft.
5092380	5093380	That's great.
5093380	5094380	Hazelnut Oreos.
5094380	5098540	Do they have all the crazy Oreo flavors down there that we get up here?
5098540	5101780	Like oh, they're in like individual serving packs.
5101780	5102780	That's kind of neat.
5102780	5106260	I actually saw a news article saying we might actually get the hazelnut ones domestically
5106260	5107260	in a couple of months.
5107260	5108980	It's weird that we don't already have them.
5109300	5110300	Yeah.
5110300	5111300	Okay.
5111300	5112300	I've never had these hazelnut Oreos.
5112300	5113300	Are you going to give me one?
5113300	5114300	Okay.
5114300	5122140	Well, if I don't usually listen to the ladies that anyway, here it is.
5122140	5123700	The cookie tastes different.
5123700	5125260	Oh my God.
5125260	5126260	Yeah.
5126260	5128620	The cookie doesn't the cookie taste different to you?
5128620	5130100	It tastes like real chocolate.
5130100	5131100	Yeah.
5131100	5132100	That's very different.
5132100	5133580	I like it though.
5133580	5136100	Maybe it's not made with high fructose corn syrup.
5136100	5137500	Maybe not.
5137500	5138500	It's made with real corn.
5138500	5139500	All right.
5139500	5143580	It's so fucking good.
5143580	5146540	We're breaking all the rules of how you're supposed to do a podcast.
5146540	5148660	You know, they're like, don't eat when you do a podcast.
5148660	5149660	Well, you know what?
5149660	5152380	I'm sorry.
5152380	5155060	Podcasters that think they're better than us.
5155060	5156460	I got a challenge for you.
5156460	5158700	I'm going to set these hazelnut Oreos down in front of you.
5158700	5160700	Don't do Patreon then.
5160700	5161700	Don't go there.
5161700	5163900	Are you going to do the ASMR crunching on the microphone?
5163900	5164900	Yeah.
5164900	5165900	It's just an ASMR show.
5165900	5166900	Yeah.
5166900	5167900	You can't hear me crunching.
5167900	5168900	Okay.
5168900	5178300	What I'm going to do now is I'm going to eat a hazelnut Oreo and I'm going to do it slow
5178300	5183140	so that I can actually savor every little bite.
5183140	5185340	That's just annoying.
5185340	5186340	All right.
5186340	5187340	Anyway.
5187340	5192060	That'll give a shit because I have hazelnut.
5192060	5194340	Let's get back into some rapid fire news.
5194340	5197380	Loki save us by talking about some actual video games.
5197380	5198380	Okay.
5198380	5204140	So we talked a little bit about PUBG earlier and how they were bitching about, you know,
5204140	5206580	people copying their style.
5206580	5212380	Well, this is one style I don't want copied and that's, well, the Xbox one version.
5212380	5218900	So apparently at the very least you get, um, if you purchase your Xbox one, um, starting
5218900	5223460	December 17th and I don't know how long this is running, I think maybe through the end
5223460	5228300	of the year or something like that, but you'll get a complimentary copy of the Xbox one version
5228300	5231540	of PUBG with your game or game system.
5231540	5232540	So that's kind of cool.
5232540	5233660	At least you get a game.
5233660	5239300	The only downside to that is apparently the game runs like shit on the Xbox one X and
5239300	5243540	Xbox one S, um, sub 30 FPS.
5243540	5250540	So that's not good considering that this game is kind of like Microsoft's like fucking flagship
5250540	5251540	right now.
5251540	5255780	It's like I actually logged into mixer cause they updated on my phone and they were like,
5255780	5256780	Oh, it's a whole new space.
5256780	5258460	I looked at, it's like, it's all fucking PUBG.
5258460	5264420	It's all PUBG, not all, but I have some serious streaming asset issues with the game.
5264420	5269380	I mean, there's, they were showing, I guess a digital foundry had done like a whole, uh,
5269380	5271300	frame rate analysis of it.
5271300	5276260	And I guess it was dipping on the Xbox one S I think doing like the skydiving portion
5276260	5277260	or whatever.
5277260	5281500	It's like down to like four FPS, you know, it's ridiculously low.
5281500	5287300	So that sucks, but Hey, at least it's free and you know what, it's not always going to
5287300	5288300	be like that forever.
5288300	5291220	I mean, they are going to fix the game eventually.
5291220	5292220	I hope.
5292220	5295500	Um, and it is technically an early access.
5295500	5299260	That's really silly being that this is a console game, but you know, that's a new thing that
5299260	5303300	consoles want to do now is, Hey, it also got nominated for game of the year.
5303300	5304300	So that's true.
5304300	5307980	Uh, it's like, Hey, well I mean, and don't get me wrong if you want to play the game
5307980	5311340	and you have your choice playing on PC, but Hey, if you're getting it for free,
5311820	5312820	why not?
5312820	5319020	Um, and then, um, news that will definitely please Bobby black Wolf.
5319020	5322020	There's been a two month delay for Nino Cooney too.
5322020	5323020	He will.
5323020	5326460	He won't be satisfied until it's canceled, but for the rest of us, so it'll be out on
5326460	5331780	March 23rd, 2018 they don't really list a reason why I assume is because their demo
5331780	5333580	was pretty bad.
5333580	5334580	What did he know?
5334580	5337820	Cooney to get a demo to no, but you know, they're developing it.
5337820	5338820	Yeah, yeah, I get it.
5338820	5339820	I get it.
5340140	5344100	Maybe there was just some fatal error that, cause the game would have needed to go gold
5344100	5345100	around this week.
5345100	5346100	So maybe some fatal error.
5346100	5350940	Well yeah, originally it was scheduled for, um, the fall and then scheduled for January
5350940	5356140	and now it's March 23rd pushing it back and back.
5356140	5361140	Well, Hey, as long, as long as it's quality, a good game is good forever, blah, blah, blah,
5361140	5362140	blah, blah.
5362140	5366340	As long as while we can beat the demo, I think this time they just aren't going to fucking
5366340	5368180	do a demo and then they'll say, how do you like that?
5368180	5372060	Bobby Black Wolf, since you complained about demos, we're just not going to do one.
5372060	5373060	You ruined it single-handedly.
5373060	5374580	I'm just kidding.
5374580	5375580	It was a terrible demo.
5375580	5377420	The game was much better than the demo.
5377420	5378420	All right.
5378420	5381020	Anyhow, let's move on and talk about Squeenix.
5381020	5384620	This is something I think we all like is old Squeenix titles, right?
5384620	5387100	Even Bobby can agree old Squeenix titles are cool.
5387100	5393020	Uh, anyhow, this was a comment from Iosuke Matsuda in a, an interview with a publication
5393020	5395140	out of the UK MCV.
5395180	5400460	One of our other big initiatives is to get as many of our past titles available via digital
5400460	5401460	release.
5401460	5404660	Among the younger generations of gamers, you've got lots of people out there who may have
5404660	5409100	heard of our past titles, but have never had an opportunity to play them.
5409100	5413460	So we think that program of porting and transferring the older titles over to newer platforms such
5413460	5418900	as the switch is very important so that people get that awareness of our back catalog.
5418900	5421660	Just straight port is in our cutting it.
5421700	5425660	We need to update those and modernize them to make something that works for modern gamers
5425660	5430560	to do that port of final fantasy four that was only on the Vita that was really good
5430560	5434140	because it was still like the 2d Sprite thing, but it was like new.
5434140	5438260	It wasn't the 3d remake or even like, was it, I think it was the PSP final fantasy games
5438260	5439260	too.
5439260	5440260	That's what I meant.
5440260	5441260	Sorry.
5441260	5442260	Not PS Vita, PSP final fantasy four.
5442260	5444340	The PSP ones were good because they were still 2d and stuff.
5444340	5445340	One and two.
5445340	5446340	Yeah.
5446340	5448060	One and two were just Final Fantasy origins I think all the way back on PlayStation.
5448060	5449060	Yeah.
5449060	5451620	They also had like, was it like, didn't they have like some dungeon or something?
5451620	5453340	It was like randomly generated.
5453340	5455300	I believe that was in four.
5455300	5459980	They had like a random dungeon, but anyway, do, do put, I doubt a lot of people got to
5459980	5463620	play that on the Vita, put that version out on the switch, but I worry that they'll stick
5463620	5465180	with that 3d version.
5465180	5466180	That's the 3ds.
5466180	5467980	And it's, it's okay.
5467980	5472660	I mean, if obviously four is still a great game, but I just, I don't know.
5472660	5476960	I feel like the 3d is too much, but that's, that's my concern there anyway.
5476960	5478100	So that's pretty cool though.
5478100	5481300	And uh, excited to hear about some of the older Squeenix titles.
5481300	5483340	Now here's my, here's my real suggestion though.
5483340	5484340	Okay.
5484340	5485420	We can talk about fantasy all we want.
5485420	5486420	Here's the thing.
5486420	5490780	Squeenix, we call them Squeenix because they're square enix, right?
5490780	5494900	How about you fucking dip into the enix catalog and give us some of that shit.
5494900	5498660	Like how about the like soul blazer illusion of Gaia.
5498660	5504560	Do that or even better, uh, the bust a groove slash bust a move games, depending on what
5504560	5505560	country you lived in.
5505560	5507620	How about those games re-imagined on switch?
5507620	5508940	That would be cool.
5508940	5510820	So right, Jamie?
5510820	5511820	Hell yeah.
5511820	5512820	Hell yeah.
5512820	5514180	And how about a new one while we're at it?
5514180	5515180	Be nice.
5515180	5516540	All right.
5516540	5520140	Also looking to dip into the vault, Capcom is saying that they are looking to port more
5520140	5521780	games for the Nintendo switch.
5521780	5526380	Uh, this was, uh, something, uh, that was picked up via Twitter, uh, and then an interview
5526380	5532540	that Capcom CEO Tsujimoto did with the Nikkei saying the home and portable concept works
5532540	5537420	better than expected and Capcom wants to port games to the switch that were not available
5537420	5539660	on Nintendo consoles previously.
5539660	5543740	So here's hoping that Disney morning show thing makes it cause I still haven't bought
5543740	5548020	that waiting for the switch version and we know the Mega Man games are coming, so we'll
5548020	5550040	see what else maybe of the old school.
5550040	5551940	How about Power Stone?
5551940	5557600	What I really want is the Phoenix Wright game that never got released in North America.
5557600	5560940	I realize that's translation and not porting, but that would be nice.
5560940	5561940	You never know.
5561940	5562940	Never know.
5562940	5563940	All right.
5563940	5568860	Uh, and lastly, let's talk about Dissidia NT because Dissidia NT is coming out January
5568860	5572460	11th in Japan and January 30th in the West.
5572460	5578000	All 28 fighters in the game have been announced at this point, including the cloud of darkness
5578000	5580460	among some other villains as well.
5580460	5585940	Uh, we have Ramza from Final Fantasy Tactics, Ace from Final Fantasy Type Zero and Noctis
5585940	5587260	also got in the game.
5587260	5589500	Do we get gold farmers from Final Fantasy 11?
5589500	5590500	Here we go.
5590500	5591500	Here's, here's the list.
5591500	5596220	All the characters in Dissidia from Final Fantasy one, the Warrior of Light and Garland
5596220	5601280	from Final Fantasy two, Furion and the Emperor from Final Fantasy three, the Onion Knight
5601280	5606580	and the Cloud of Darkness from Final Fantasy four, Cecil, Kane from Final Fantasy five,
5606580	5607580	Golbez.
5607580	5609140	Golbez was in four, not five.
5609140	5611100	Or was there also a character named Golbez in five?
5611100	5612540	I think this list might be wrong.
5612540	5616500	Uh, Bartz was definitely a five character though, as was Exdeath and then from Final
5616500	5622740	Fantasy six, Terra and Kefka from Final Fantasy seven, Cloud and Sephiroth from Final Fantasy
5622740	5629060	eight, Squall and Ultimicia from Final Fantasy nine, Zidane and Kuja from Final Fantasy ten,
5629060	5632700	Tidus and Jecht from Final Fantasy 11, Shantotto.
5632700	5635700	And that's it because Shantotto is the only Final Fantasy 11 character that ever shows
5635700	5636700	up anywhere else.
5636700	5642500	From Final Fantasy 12, Van, okay, Square.
5642500	5647740	Why Van and not Balthier or Fran or Balthier and Fran?
5647740	5648740	Why?
5648740	5649740	Square?
5649740	5650740	Why?
5650740	5651740	No, I want a fucking reason.
5651740	5653540	I want a show until Square answers me.
5653540	5655100	Why not Balthier or Fran?
5655100	5660580	I'll take, I'll take, uh, I'll take what's going to be in the DLC for 500 Alex.
5660580	5663420	Bing, bing, bing, okay.
5663420	5665940	Loki answered on your behalf Square Enix.
5665940	5667140	The listeners have been saved.
5667140	5673900	From Final Fantasy 13, Lightning, from Final Fantasy 14, Ishtola, and from 15, Noctis,
5673900	5679820	and then type zero has Ace and Tactics has Ramza, Ramza, I said Ramma, no unfortunately
5679820	5684700	Ramna will not, Ramna will not be in the game, but Ramza seriously out, out skilled
5684700	5685700	there.
5685700	5687020	What the hell am I doing here?
5687020	5688300	He'll kill them all.
5688300	5694740	All right, anyway, uh, moving on, let's get to some other news, uh, Dark Sakura for rapid
5694740	5695860	fire news.
5695860	5702580	Um, there is a survey recently put out on, uh, about a UK video game companies.
5702580	5708300	It says that 29% of them have been damaged by Brexit, um, that it's really taken a big
5708340	5711300	hit into, uh, the gaming industry there.
5711300	5716140	They're saying that, uh, this is based off of a sample of 63 game businesses, including
5716140	5718220	small, medium, and large companies.
5718220	5723020	And 29% of the respondents feel like their process, uh, feel like the process has been
5723020	5728940	particularly damaged, damaging to them because of how it impacts recruitment and retention.
5728940	5730940	So, bah.
5730940	5734700	Then again, about 11% of them believe that it's been favorable, but we don't care what
5734700	5736020	they think.
5736020	5746900	So moving forward, um, we also have, uh, on December 22nd in Japan, there will be a versus
5746900	5750660	Super Mario Brothers will be arriving on the Switch eShop.
5750660	5758220	Um, it will be 823 yen, so it's about 799 in the US and it will have new and remixed
5758220	5761300	content from the original.
5761300	5763380	I'm actually kind of excited about this.
5763380	5764380	Yes.
5764380	5768060	Cause the closest thing we have to virtual console on the Switch right now, but it is
5768060	5771660	kind of neat that it's like the arcade one, which is a little harder, you know?
5771660	5773220	It was, it was a remix.
5773220	5774220	Yes.
5774220	5775220	Yes.
5775220	5776220	It will be even mixier.
5776220	5777220	That's right.
5777220	5781500	Let's, uh, mix up some release dates and talk about what's coming out to a video game store
5781500	5782500	near you.
5782500	5784700	Although I imagine this week is going to get a little dull, right?
5784700	5785700	Um, yeah.
5785700	5789820	So I'm just going to cover what's up for the rest of the year since it's really not a whole
5789820	5791460	ton of stuff.
5791460	5794780	And none of these I'm really recognizing except for Life is Strange.
5794780	5795980	So we'll start there.
5795980	5798700	Life is Strange before the storm episode three.
5798700	5801500	That's going to be coming out on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox one.
5801500	5806580	We have a game called Dragon Fang Z, the Rose and Dungeon of Time.
5806580	5814020	That's coming out on the Switch, defunct on PS4 and Xbox one, uh, Slice Dice and Rice.
5814020	5815020	I love that title.
5815020	5817580	I don't know what it is, but I want to know more about it.
5817580	5823580	Uh, that's coming out on PlayStation four, um, Blossom tales, the sleeping King on Nintendo
5823580	5830260	switch, a tiny metal that's going to be out on PC switch and PlayStation four.
5830260	5838500	And finally on Christmas day, style savvy styling star on the three D S. Um, that's,
5838500	5840220	that's gotta be some weird placeholder day.
5840220	5841820	You don't release games on Christmas day.
5841820	5843700	I don't think it's actually coming out that day.
5843700	5844700	Maybe digital.
5845700	5853740	It could be a digital, but I, I, yeah, I doubt that it's that, uh, Oh, well that's okay.
5853740	5858660	Listen, this is a U S release state, you know, site.
5858660	5863260	Why is there a subtitle or a little footnote here saying this release date is only for
5863260	5865000	Japan only.
5865000	5868260	That is misleading because this is supposed to be for North America.
5868260	5873340	It's some, some, and Slice Dice and Rice is a fucking amazing name of a game.
5873980	5874980	I am very disappointed.
5874980	5875980	Sorry to hear it.
5875980	5878100	Well, let's talk about what else is coming out in Japan because there are some releases
5878100	5879100	still this week.
5879100	5881820	Uh, Christmas is in Japan, but it's a little different.
5881820	5882820	Okay.
5882820	5883820	There, there may be cake involved.
5883820	5888340	So, um, but, uh, we still have some releases coming out this week in Japan, including on
5888340	5889340	the PlayStation four.
5889340	5896940	Ottlier, uh, Liddy and Sawyer, Fushigi, not Kaiga, no Renkin Jutsu samurai comes out.
5896940	5899980	That's basically another Ottlier game, uh, that is out this week.
5900020	5903540	Okami, uh, Zekai Ban comes out on the PlayStation four this week.
5903540	5906820	So that of course is the Okami, um, remaster on PlayStation four.
5906820	5908220	That is also on December 21st.
5908220	5912160	If you are an idol master fan, which I'm sure Loki is, you can look forward to Stella stage
5912160	5913680	is out this week.
5913680	5918140	And if you are more of a, a train type of per type of person, if Misty's out there somewhere,
5918140	5922980	uh, you can check out a train day equal, which I think is actually an expansion or at least
5922980	5923980	they call it exp.
5923980	5927860	So maybe that's just part of the name, but another, a train game available on PlayStation
5927860	5928860	four.
5928860	5934180	So, um, put those games out, um, here in the U S like, or at least try, like, I guess maybe
5934180	5935180	they just don't want to localize them.
5935180	5936180	I don't know.
5936180	5940180	The Vita still has games that Ottlier game is also out on the Vita this week, as well
5940180	5945620	as the game called code realize Shirogane no Kisuke comes out this week on the PlayStation
5945620	5946620	Vita.
5946620	5950340	And then looking over to the Nintendo switch, that Ottlier game is also on the Nintendo
5950340	5956060	switch and one piece Kaizuko Musou three deluxe edition is also out on the switch this week
5956060	5958980	on December, uh, 21st.
5958980	5965640	And then lastly on the three DS Medarot classics, there's a Kabuto version, a Kuwagata version
5965640	5968280	and a 20th anniversary edition.
5968280	5972820	All those are out on the three DS this week, all from Imagineer.
5972820	5973820	So you can check that out.
5973820	5977320	And those look like they look like Gameboy games kind of reimagined on the three DS.
5977320	5979740	So that's kind of neat.
5979740	5983080	All right, let's move on to the UK dark Sakura.
5983080	5986760	There's only one thing with a date on it, and that's December 27th, the steam world
5986760	5989360	heist on switch.
5989360	5990360	There it is.
5990360	5991360	That's it.
5991360	5992360	All right.
5992360	5997080	Well, let's, uh, we, well, actually I rage said he resend an email during the break.
5997080	5999040	So I don't know if you want to jump in the email bag or whatever.
5999040	6000440	I'll try if I can get it to work.
6000440	6001880	Remember it wasn't working.
6001880	6002880	That's true.
6002880	6003880	It wasn't working.
6003880	6004880	I have it here.
6004880	6006560	I can always read it if we need to, but we are going to, uh, take a trip into the mail
6006560	6008200	bag.
6008200	6012340	When you guys send us emails, participate at orange lounge radio.com is the place to
6012340	6013340	send us emails.
6013340	6017900	I have to get logged back in and dark Sakura will usually dive into the mail bag headfirst
6017900	6020500	and find some emails to read for us tonight.
6020500	6025380	I had it closed and we're going to get this one email here and then I will encourage you
6025380	6028260	guys of course to email us even though we're not going to be live for a few weeks.
6028260	6031540	We can always read your email when we get back and we do have a bonus show.
6031540	6033820	That's going to be during the break.
6033820	6034820	Okay, great.
6034820	6035820	Yeah.
6035820	6040100	So starting from reginator, hi all it's reginator.
6040100	6042700	I just wanted to give you all a quick heads up.
6042700	6046340	As you probably noticed by now, I'm not in chat to listen to bobby's or your shows.
6046340	6051460	Unfortunately that can't be helped the hero king, but I think means long and short of
6051460	6056580	it is that my video card issues have gotten far worse and my PC is currently and effectively
6056580	6061460	unusable until I can come up with the money to get a new video card found on my current
6061460	6063460	one completely died.
6063460	6067540	Just to get something that I know will work in my PC and is relatively cheap.
6067540	6069300	I'll be getting the same thing.
6069300	6073220	It's currently in my PC and Nvidia Geforce GT 610.
6073220	6075820	However it will take some time to gather up the money and get one.
6075820	6081000	That being said, for the time being I will have to rely on my local library's PC to access
6081000	6082220	the internet and whatnot.
6082220	6085860	I try to rejoin the VoG community as soon as humanly possible.
6085860	6091940	As an aside, seeing as how I can't, I really can't do anything online from home for the
6091940	6092940	time being.
6092940	6098300	Dark Tetsuya is pretty much in charge of the raging deals steam group until things are
6098300	6100140	back up and running at home.
6100140	6103200	Anyway, I'll take care and talk to you all soon hopefully.
6103200	6107200	Well he's in chat now so he must have been able to fix some of those issues, but that's
6107200	6109100	probably a good call is to just go for it.
6109100	6114020	I mean the video card technology changes so fast that like buying what you have now is
6114020	6116580	probably going to be cheaper than what you paid for it then.
6116580	6124260	I may still have my old card which is a kick up from that and I'll talk to Dan about making
6124260	6125260	you a deal on it.
6125260	6126260	Ho ho ho.
6126260	6127260	There you go.
6127260	6128260	We'll see.
6128260	6136660	It's uh, I think uh, it's I think around like that same era of Geforce, but it's like
6136660	6137980	one of the black editions.
6137980	6139820	So it was pretty okay.
6139820	6142320	I was running wow on it and all the stuff.
6142320	6143320	So
6143320	6144320	All right.
6144320	6145320	All right.
6145320	6151780	Um, hello L R. Well hello Y Y R. In last week's mailbag Robert M mused about the possibility
6151780	6154400	of an intense horror game in an arcade.
6154400	6155400	Guess what?
6155400	6156560	This already exists.
6156560	6160180	If you're in North America, get to your local Dave and busters and play Namco's dark escape
6160180	6166240	for D as a closed booth person, first person, two player mounted gun rail shooter that uses
6166240	6171760	three D glasses for and it just reloaded the email weird.
6171760	6172760	That's weird.
6172760	6178460	Um, uh, and features tons of jump scares, loud noises and even blows air on you.
6178460	6180680	It's quite difficult but worth a play through.
6180680	6181680	Wait.
6181680	6185640	So Y Y R is recommending a game that will literally blow you.
6186440	6187440	The future is now.
6187440	6188440	Yes.
6188440	6189440	That's right.
6189440	6190440	Wow.
6190440	6191440	I live in the future.
6191440	6194760	Dave and busters isn't the only place you can find dark escape for D, but it's the most
6194760	6195760	common.
6195760	6200600	The game is at all of their locations, but it will also be at other large arcades such
6200600	6203680	as round one and I've seen it in a random bowling alley too.
6203680	6207280	You should hopefully be able to find it wherever in the world you happen to be.
6207280	6208280	Enjoy Aaron.
6208280	6209280	Y Y R.
6209280	6211980	Well thank you for the tip because obviously we didn't think of it and I had no idea something
6211980	6212980	like this existed.
6212980	6215600	Remember the AKB 48 game that we played at round one?
6215600	6216600	Yes.
6216600	6220340	That game is terrible and wonderful.
6220340	6223720	Is that also a survival horror game that you recommend?
6223720	6225480	If you want to laugh your ass off.
6225480	6227040	That's the one where they're like zombies, right?
6227040	6228040	Yeah.
6228040	6229040	That's pretty funny.
6229040	6233420	They're like still like, you know, for people who don't know, that's a girl group in Japan.
6233420	6237120	Like they're performing their number and you choose like one of them is like your friend
6237120	6240900	or something and they will just like in the middle of their number turn zombie and try
6240900	6241900	to eat your face.
6241900	6244440	Like it's the most surreal thing.
6244440	6245800	That sounds hilariously bad.
6245800	6247280	I kind of love it.
6247280	6248280	Did you play it?
6248280	6249280	No, I didn't.
6249280	6251960	You guys were off giggling and playing it or something and I went and played something
6251960	6252960	else.
6252960	6256800	Yeah, it's, it's, I was, I was, I was probably playing the gigantic keyboard game that gives
6256800	6257840	you tickets.
6257840	6258840	I love that.
6258840	6259840	I love that game.
6259840	6262360	Cause I just spent, Oh my God, I have to share this.
6262360	6263360	Act Def'd.
6263360	6264360	Kitty in a bet.
6264360	6265360	Please get a picture of that.
6265360	6266360	Okay.
6266360	6272000	So we opened Act Def's present and now Mr. Smoosh has decided to co-op the box and use
6272000	6276220	the box for himself.
6276220	6278880	So just so you know, I got, I got a picture.
6278880	6279880	You did get a picture.
6279880	6282640	Can you like tweet it out and retweet it or something?
6282640	6283640	So back.
6283640	6284640	Okay.
6284640	6285640	That's hilarious.
6285640	6290480	My fashion is that SSU 100 Matt says it's his box now.
6290480	6291480	So there you go.
6291480	6292480	Yeah.
6292480	6295680	Send me this tweet out the one where he's sitting in the box.
6295680	6296680	If you got that JD.
6296680	6297680	Yeah.
6297680	6298680	All right.
6298680	6299680	Looking in chat over at live.
6299880	6300880	Mr. Smoosh we love you.
6300880	6302200	You people are just writing it from him.
6302200	6307200	I will use this opportunity to give a cheap plug to Mr. Smoosh's Instagram account.
6307200	6309400	You can actually follow Mr. Smoosh on Instagram.
6309400	6316960	Mr. that spelled out M I S T E R S M O O S H. I almost said S M O O O S H. Mr. Smoosh.
6316960	6317960	There it is.
6317960	6318960	He's back.
6318960	6319960	I have a look.
6319960	6320960	Okay.
6320960	6321960	Get a good picture.
6321960	6322960	Smoosh's Instagram.
6322960	6323960	All right.
6323960	6329480	Now that Mr. Smoosh has derailed the show again, let's get back into some gaming news.
6329480	6330480	Email us.
6330480	6331480	Participate at orange on trader.com.
6331480	6332480	Meanwhile, Loki.
6332480	6333480	All right.
6333480	6342280	So cry tech is actually suing the, uh, German, I guess the developer for star citizen.
6342280	6348800	So apparently, uh, cloud Imperium games, they said that there was a breach of contract.
6348800	6355400	So it's basically let their lawsuits alleging that cloud Imperium games, uh, breaches contract
6355400	6363500	cry tech that was created when the two companies, I guess it partnered to, um, create star citizen.
6363500	6372040	And then I guess with that, they're saying that, um, apparently because of, I guess it
6372040	6377100	has to do with the, the engine because they did, um, put some money, I guess, towards
6377100	6381240	the game being developed using the cry tech engine, I guess in exchange cry tech, uh,
6381240	6387120	would provide marketing and engine support for, you know, their game, I guess over, over
6387120	6392960	the time against the relationship between the two companies broke down and now, um,
6392960	6397120	the engine has, um, they've switched up the engine.
6397120	6403480	So now it switched to Amazon's lumber yard engine, which is based off of cry tech's engine.
6403480	6408320	And because I guess, so now they can't really, they put marketing behind the game, but now
6408320	6411720	that they're not using the cry tech engines, kind of like a waste of money.
6411720	6413680	And so there was an agreement that they're going to use their engine.
6413680	6414680	They didn't.
6414680	6419160	And so, but I thought lumber yard did that get discontinued?
6419160	6422280	I thought lumber yard was gone.
6422280	6423520	I could be wrong though.
6423520	6428240	Um, there's so many engines out there that come and go, but I swear lumber yard I thought
6428240	6431000	was gone.
6431000	6433840	I remember I downloaded it and then I was like, okay, I don't give a shit about this
6433840	6437720	anymore and never looked into it.
6437720	6440440	That's kind of this point, but you know, disputes happen.
6440440	6444000	It starts isn't coming out anytime soon though.
6444000	6447160	Like most games, they're usually under construction for a while.
6447160	6450760	Quite a bit of money from all the crowdfunding, but yeah.
6450760	6451760	Yeah.
6451760	6452760	Right.
6452760	6453760	All right.
6453760	6454760	Well, we'll see.
6454760	6455760	Uh, we'll see what happens.
6455760	6458600	Oh, Jamie's trying to airdrop me files in the middle of the show.
6458600	6460480	Well, I'm going to send you the adorable.
6460480	6461880	And that's why I'm going to smoosh.
6461880	6466440	I'm going to tweet it out on the OLR account as soon as I can, but I have to read, um,
6466440	6467680	another story here.
6467680	6469040	Oh, you did.
6469040	6470040	Oh, good.
6470040	6471040	All right.
6471040	6475000	Let's talk about, uh, Xbox party chat.
6475000	6478720	I remember when Xbox party chat was awesome because you could do Netflix over it, but
6478720	6480200	they got rid of that a while ago.
6480200	6481200	However, fun allowed.
6481200	6482440	No, no, no fun allowed.
6482440	6486480	Well, now you can have more fun with your phones because a new beta of the Xbox phone
6486480	6491340	app has released and this will allow you to do party chat on your mobile device.
6491340	6495860	So you can chat with your Xbox party on your mobile device, which is how the Nintendo switch
6495900	6500100	app works, but it's still built into the console too.
6500100	6503220	So the Xbox app is available for both iOS and Android.
6503220	6506500	The new beta, however, right now is only on Google play, but for all we know, it could
6506500	6507900	just be going through iOS certification.
6507900	6509740	It might still show up there.
6509740	6512860	You can chat with your Xbox party even when not at a console.
6512860	6515740	So what's kind of cool about that is that, you know, if your, your friends are gaming
6515740	6519620	on Xbox, you can join the party from your mobile device and talk, you know, in the car
6519620	6522740	so that hands-free in the car, uh, or something like that.
6522740	6526020	So, uh, there's nothing official that's come out from Microsoft on this yet.
6526020	6529300	Uh, this is mostly because of Reddit has spotted this feature.
6529300	6532900	So we don't know because it's a beta, maybe they're not another thing too, which would
6532900	6534640	come in handy.
6534640	6540620	Not seeing a lot of people play the game, but you know, certain games like Minecraft,
6540620	6543100	um, are cross platform.
6543100	6547420	And so you could play from your mobile device with people that are on Xbox.
6547420	6548420	So you could party chat.
6548420	6550060	We'll play Minecraft cross platform.
6553540	6557300	And you can, uh, can you, I wonder if you can crash other people's games and just do
6557300	6560420	a go on your mobile phone device to start screaming hysterically people.
6560420	6562840	But I guess that's just, that's just regular Xbox live, isn't it?
6562840	6565700	So it's not really box live simulator.
6565700	6566700	Is that a game?
6566700	6567700	I'm sure that's a game.
6567700	6568700	That should be a game.
6568700	6573880	There has to be, that could be the safe version because you can, you know, we'll just ban
6573880	6574880	it off steam.
6574880	6575880	Don't show it to pornographic.
6575880	6578540	And so, you know, all right.
6578540	6582100	Just a few more stories for you guys before we get to our Skypline at orange lounge radio,
6582100	6588260	all one word on Skype, but first Jamie, Oh, I love your cat.
6588260	6589260	Me too.
6589260	6593580	That is the best little pussy ever.
6593580	6596340	I can't wait to crop that quote and use it out of context.
6596340	6597340	All right.
6597340	6598340	Okay.
6598340	6604780	Um, Autodesk, which, um, I, I kind of have a bit of a history with them cause I used
6604780	6607620	to use Maya a whole lot for 3d rendering.
6608580	6616140	But there's Stingray game development engine is being discontinued, which as far as I knew
6616140	6622540	there was a decent amount of development being done on it from time to time.
6622540	6627580	But the software is actually still going to be included with the Maya LT subscriptions
6627580	6632380	for the time being, but they're no longer going to be doing any development or updates
6632380	6635060	or sales on it down the line.
6635060	6640060	And this is coming right after Autodesk, uh, laid off pretty much a bunch of people.
6640060	6641060	So sad.
6641060	6642060	Yeah.
6642060	6648980	They laid off about 13% of their company layoffs are no fun, especially this time of year.
6648980	6649980	Yeah.
6649980	6650980	Yeah.
6650980	6655780	But I knew a few people who had worked on a few things in, uh, in, uh, Stingray.
6655780	6660120	So sometimes sometimes you want to hold onto those old engines that you know how to use,
6660120	6662560	you know, I know how, I know how that goes.
6662560	6668080	Look at us using shout cast to podcast all these years later, Twitch, what?
6668080	6669080	All right.
6669080	6670080	Uh, Loki.
6670080	6671080	All right.
6671080	6676600	And so this is really random, but I guess that they're adding the predator to ghost
6676600	6679380	recon wild lands for a few weeks.
6679380	6684320	So beginning, uh, December 14th and running through the beginning of January, you can
6684320	6691600	play a special challenge where it's either you, um, or up to a group of four will have
6691600	6695880	to survive the predator.
6695880	6696880	That's neat.
6696880	6701720	I guess that's kind of random, but neat.
6701720	6705600	I hear it's not very good, but it's a neat idea.
6705600	6706960	Why not put the predator in it?
6706960	6711120	Just, just because just put the predator in there cause you know, does your game need
6711120	6712120	a little boost?
6712120	6713120	How about the predator?
6713120	6714120	How about the predator?
6714120	6715600	Hey, it works for mortal combat.
6715600	6716600	That's right.
6716600	6717600	Why not put it in Mario Odyssey?
6717600	6720280	Even though I gave her really should be in all the games.
6720280	6721280	That's right.
6721960	6726000	Animal crossing predator, come on listless right now, game that needs the predator added
6726000	6727000	to it.
6727000	6731080	I mean, you joke, but the predator also crossed over into Archie comics, like in the nineties.
6731080	6733720	Like that is an actual thing that was published.
6733720	6735920	Will the predator show up at Riverdale then?
6735920	6740280	Um, probably not because Archie has crossed over with a lot of unexpected things like
6740280	6741280	that.
6741280	6742280	So probably not.
6742280	6744280	Is Casper the friendly ghost in Riverdale?
6744280	6745280	I don't watch the show.
6745280	6746400	I don't, I don't know.
6746400	6747400	Not yet.
6747400	6749080	Josie is, and I think they're going to add Sabrina.
6749080	6751040	We need Melissa Joan Hart to show up as Sabrina.
6751040	6756740	Well, but then I, I think they are actually doing a Sabrina show on the CW, but they're
6756740	6757740	doing it.
6757740	6759180	They're not, it's not going to be like the ABC show.
6759180	6761200	They're doing it that whole like dark comic style.
6761200	6762200	Like Riverdale is.
6762200	6763920	I would watch a Sabrina show like that.
6763920	6764920	Yeah.
6764920	6768280	So quick guys in our chat, uh, let's, let's do like a, we won't do a real list list, but
6768280	6772160	if this were a list list, what would be the game game that needs predator added to it?
6772160	6777320	Prey predator and prey dance, dance revolution, dance revolution.
6777320	6780720	You better dance faster, you son of a bitch.
6780720	6782040	I'm going to kill you.
6782040	6786400	Dua beach volleyball, dead or alive beach volleyball,
6786400	6794600	Silent hill, uh, super bass fishing, bass bass.
6794600	6800160	I don't know why I said bass bass, DDR bass, super bass.
6800160	6804760	Although now that we're on this tangent, super bass fishing would be hilarious where you
6804760	6809320	try to like catch fish using like a subwoofer and you have to have like these jalopies with
6809320	6812640	giant ass subwoofers, just knocking the fish out of the water.
6812640	6813640	That'd be hilarious.
6813640	6816600	When you don't catch the fish, you just hear a little boom, boom, boom, boom, but like
6816600	6817600	a little bass.
6817600	6822560	So licensing for that song from Nicki Minaj would be like, would torpedo that project.
6822560	6823560	Okay.
6823560	6824560	Some comments from chat.
6824560	6825560	SSU 100.
6825560	6831800	Matt says predator cooking mama cook, cook the right meal for them or they'll kill you.
6831800	6832800	That's great.
6832840	6833840	Dartitsia says Loki.
6833840	6834840	That's an amazing idea.
6834840	6835840	Very good.
6835840	6836840	I like that.
6836840	6837840	Predator cooking mama.
6837840	6844040	What if you had predator as like a skin for like, like pro hunting, like those hunting
6844040	6847680	games, except you could switch from the gun to being the predator.
6847680	6852000	Like they say like Cabela's in every Walmart in America.
6852000	6853000	Yeah.
6853000	6855760	But what if they do like a predator game like that where you go around like hunting people.
6855760	6856760	Okay.
6856760	6857760	I like that.
6857760	6858760	You have like little claw controllers.
6859640	6861360	You combine the claw game.
6861360	6863160	That's always right next to the Cabela game at every Walmart.
6863160	6866360	Not that, but you have like little hand controllers that are the claws.
6866360	6867360	It was my attempt at a joke.
6867360	6868360	All right.
6868360	6869360	Uh, let's see.
6869360	6870360	You know me.
6870360	6871360	I have an answer for everything.
6871360	6874640	Bob coffee suggests one, two, three predator fail the mini game and you die.
6874640	6876160	Um, let's see.
6876160	6880920	Vid power says predator is a robot master and mega man dungeon buster says predator
6880920	6881920	right?
6881920	6882920	Ace assassin.
6882920	6883920	Objection.
6884920	6885920	Kill you.
6885920	6886920	Hold it.
6886920	6887920	Hmm.
6887920	6892960	Uh, and lastly, SSG 100 Matt says predator spice world.
6892960	6896120	It's just the same game as spice world, but with predator heads.
6896120	6900720	Let's put another predator through her paces.
6900720	6901720	I would love it.
6901720	6906440	Like, it's just like you have like a game or a movie like that, but it just, they never
6906440	6908040	acknowledged that it's the predator.
6908040	6913200	It's just like another person there never acknowledging that there's a giant alien death
6913200	6914200	machine.
6914200	6915200	It's just.
6915200	6916200	I love it.
6916200	6917200	All right.
6917200	6924040	Well, there's only one more character that could make your game more awesome than adding
6924040	6928120	the predator to it and that would be adding Betty white to it.
6928120	6929120	That's right.
6929120	6933880	Let's talk about the golden girls here at the end of the show because apparently there
6933880	6937840	is a game that's being developed at somebody's little side project called the golden girls
6937840	6939720	take Manhattan DX.
6939720	6945000	Uh, and apparently, uh, this game is something you can read about on tumbler.
6945000	6950840	So the creator of this game is located on tumbler at Grawley, G R A W L Y dot tumbler.com.
6950840	6954960	And apparently, uh, this person is a software engineer at mid boss who is the company that
6954960	6959680	made 2064 read only memories, which they just kind of stealth dropped on the Vita during
6959680	6960920	the PSX.
6960920	6965200	So anyway, golden girls take Manhattan is something that's been a project since January
6965200	6970300	2017 and basically you guys, it's golden girls meets persona.
6970300	6971300	That is what this is.
6971300	6976920	And for some reason you kill me, mr baseball and there's Kevin from home alone that Sophia
6976920	6979600	has to kill for, I don't know why.
6979600	6984520	And for some reason, um, Stanley, which is a Dorothy's ex husband is in the corner saying,
6984520	6985620	fuck them up girls.
6985620	6990440	So I, I mean, why not don't know what that is, but why not?
6990440	6995240	Basically this started as a silly joke, but now like it's, it's, it's a fucking like concerted
6995240	6996240	effort.
6996240	6999920	Although, I mean, if they release this, they're not going to be able to charge a dime for
6999920	7003880	it cause you know, they licensed the golden girls for everything now that's golden girls.
7003880	7008800	There's golden girls clue, golden girls, Napoli, like they, they, they fucking know that everybody
7008800	7013120	loves the golden girls, but you know, it only took 30 years for them to have their day.
7013120	7016480	Why wouldn't they license this to, you know, that's a good point.
7016480	7018240	That's a very good point.
7018240	7019240	So anyway, there you go.
7019240	7024480	If you like persona and you like the golden girls or shit, how can you not like both?
7024480	7027480	This game looks like it's something up your alley and uh, I hope it happens.
7027480	7030920	I hope it's able to be released in some form or another.
7030920	7031920	So there you go.
7031920	7036920	Uh, maybe, maybe Grawley will listen to this show and sneak the predator in there too.
7036920	7040920	Just because, just because, all right, I'm going to invite him on the show.
7040920	7043360	I will talk about the golden girls.
7043360	7044360	Okay.
7044360	7046920	Do you think I'm going to fucking say, if somebody comes here, I need to talk about
7046920	7048280	a golden girls project.
7048280	7049280	Come on.
7049280	7050880	I'm not, don't even finish the sentence.
7050880	7051880	Golden girls.
7051880	7052880	You had me at golden girls.
7052880	7054880	You had me at St. Olaf.
7054880	7056640	All right.
7056640	7057960	We'll share some cheesecake.
7057960	7058960	Talk about games.
7058960	7062520	Uh, speaking of talking about games, you can come give us a call on Skype right now.
7062520	7064800	Orange lounge radio, all one word on Skype.
7064800	7070040	St. Olaf's row, St. Olaf's row.
7070040	7071040	I like that.
7071040	7072040	What do you do?
7072040	7074000	Just like run off with people's tractors?
7074000	7075000	What wouldn't you do?
7075000	7076000	What wouldn't you do?
7076000	7077960	You'd kill everybody.
7077960	7078960	Suplex people.
7078960	7083720	I mean, I mean, I'm sure you could use character creator to basically make Sophia Petrello
7083720	7085000	in saints row.
7085000	7089560	Well, you know, there's that wonderful game from media molecule called dream coming out.
7089560	7091660	And if it's your dream, that should be able to make it.
7091660	7092960	That is my fucking dream.
7092960	7093960	Actually.
7093960	7098080	It's like, it's like you guys were in my head just then to have the golden girls killing
7098080	7099080	everybody.
7099080	7100080	That is my dream.
7100080	7104280	Any last minute stories, Loki, before we get to our Skype line at orange lounge radio,
7104280	7105280	all one word on Skype.
7105280	7106280	That's Loki.
7106280	7107280	That has last minute.
7107280	7108280	Do you have last minute stories?
7108280	7109280	No.
7109280	7110280	Cause you never do.
7110280	7111280	That's why I did last week.
7111280	7113760	The Animal Crossing garden was me.
7113760	7114760	And look, we have them today.
7114760	7116540	JD, do you have any last minute stories?
7116540	7117540	I don't.
7117540	7118540	All right.
7118540	7127500	Now that I've considered everybody, Loki, I don't have anything last minute, unfortunately.
7127500	7129000	It's been a pretty slow week.
7129000	7131140	A little bit, a little bit.
7131140	7134800	I was expecting this, this week's show to have like no news.
7134800	7138260	And at least there's like a little bit, but no news.
7138260	7139520	No good news is good.
7139520	7145160	Good news with Gary gnu and we are, we like the only people who remember the great space
7145160	7146160	coaster.
7146160	7147160	Yes.
7147160	7148160	All right.
7148160	7149160	Let's go do the phones.
7149160	7150160	Hi.
7150160	7151160	You're on orange launch radio.
7151160	7152160	Who's this?
7152160	7153160	Hey, uh, this is raging leader.
7153160	7154160	An email and a phone call tonight.
7154160	7155160	Well, what's on your mind, buddy?
7155160	7156160	Yeah.
7156160	7159840	Well, I honestly didn't seriously think I would be able to listen in, uh, tonight, you
7159840	7162400	know, live and be in China and all that.
7162400	7163400	Glad you made it.
7163400	7164400	Yeah.
7165000	7169120	Like I said, you said in the email, I've been having computer problems that I kind of sorry
7169120	7170800	got my computer to work.
7170800	7171800	I'll be in barely.
7171800	7175680	It's kind of like essentially the computer version of a coma right now.
7175680	7183280	So yeah, but uh, anyway, uh, I have a question for you.
7183280	7191140	It's not sort of, you know, not really gaming really, but it's kind of like tangential holidays.
7191140	7192140	What the hell?
7192140	7193140	What is it?
7193180	7194180	All right.
7194180	7203020	Well, no, uh, uh, I, you know, well, it helps if I put something in chat, uh, a link, cause
7203020	7210500	I'll be referencing, uh, the, the link you may want to bring it up, uh, up in your personal
7210500	7211500	web browsers.
7211500	7212500	All right.
7212500	7214860	So for the podcast listeners, um, because the podcast listeners aren't going to see
7214860	7219640	the link, I'm getting a link at new egg for a gaming, it looks like a gaming PC that's
7219640	7220640	out of stock right now.
7220640	7221640	Yeah.
7221640	7222640	Yeah.
7222640	7223640	I have a computer.
7223640	7233640	I have now my computer has, uh, in, in, in, in Nvidia G force GT six, 10, um, and right
7233640	7239640	now basically that dunk, uh, the vehicle is more or less pretty much dad for the most
7239640	7240640	part.
7240640	7247780	Um, now, you know, now to be completely honest, I have everyone within the VOD community.
7247780	7251560	I'm probably the least tech savvy out of everyone here.
7251560	7259860	Um, now that, you know, I, I just barely managed to put new, a new, uh, ram it to my computer
7259860	7263520	when I first got it, you know how I figured that out is beyond me.
7263520	7270960	But that being said, you know, if you were in my shoes, which, uh, would you, you know,
7270960	7278420	if you were to buy a new video card, you know, virtually next to nothing about switching
7278420	7283380	out parts about that, would you get the exact same card that you currently have in your
7283380	7290620	computer knowing that, Hey, it'll be compatible and it'll fit within your case or would you
7290620	7299980	take a slight gamble, maybe a slight upgrade, uh, and maybe it'll work, maybe it won't work.
7299980	7302200	Um, that's a good question.
7302200	7304440	Uh, this is, here's the thing though.
7304440	7305440	Here's the challenge.
7305440	7310000	This is why usually you want to kind of stay away from the all in one box computers anyway,
7310000	7311000	but I get it.
7311000	7313820	Like sometimes that's the cost affordability option.
7313820	7318160	And I think that's also a big, big factor in what you're talking about is I know you
7318160	7322440	might have registered your email too, is that, you know, you have cost things to, to consider
7322440	7323440	as well.
7323440	7327760	So I think with that being said, you probably just want to stick with what you have, um,
7327760	7332300	until you can kind of save up maybe to build a computer that's, you know, got a little
7332300	7333660	more beef in it.
7333660	7337060	But um, this computer doesn't exactly sound like it's a slouch though.
7337060	7339860	I mean, it should be able to handle a stronger video card.
7339860	7340860	Um,
7340860	7341860	Yeah.
7341860	7342860	Yeah.
7342860	7343860	Yeah.
7343860	7344860	No, no, no.
7344860	7351200	The fact that I've been having issues with the card aside, you know, even granted, like
7351200	7358100	you said, you know, this card that I currently have is relatively old is for, in as far as
7358100	7365260	video cards go, you know, it, you know, I've been, you know, I've been able to run games
7365260	7367860	pre, uh, pretty easily for the most part.
7367860	7374640	Uh, the only thing, you know, game that I've had problems with running is, uh, the free
7374640	7381660	version of, uh, Killer Instinct, which was released on, uh, Windows and Xbox One.
7381660	7387980	There, there is a little bit of a frame rate issue with that, but aside from that, yeah,
7387980	7388980	it's been working well.
7388980	7389980	So, um,
7389980	7390980	Okay.
7390980	7392980	Um, well, our chatters are helping out a little bit here and they know a lot more, especially
7392980	7393980	than I do.
7393980	7398660	So Rama is jumping in saying, uh, video card should match the chip set for better performance
7398660	7403320	if it's AMD or Nvidia, but granted nowadays that's a moot point, but it's something I
7403320	7404500	always go by.
7404500	7406860	S3100Matt has a great website.
7406860	7409540	Um, I don't know this site, but I, I take his word for it.
7409540	7414760	Um, S3100Matt suggests a website called pc-specs.com.
7414760	7418140	If you use that site, it's going to tell you what components are compatible with your computer.
7418140	7419260	That's a great idea.
7419260	7424020	I would say, yeah, if you got like a thing you can kind of test like that, that is, uh,
7424020	7425020	probably going to be great.
7425020	7426020	So, um,
7426020	7427020	All right.
7427020	7428020	Yeah.
7428020	7429020	Give it a try.
7429020	7433220	I do have one final question, uh, regarding video cards and I'll free up the lines for
7433220	7434640	other people to call.
7434640	7444600	I, I know at least with, uh, Nvidia, Nvidia graphics cards, no, no, w multiple companies
7444600	7455080	now make, uh, make the cards and there's slight variations, uh, there in, um, now if I were
7455080	7460340	to get like, uh, you know, uh, it's, you know, if I were to buy, you know, one of those,
7460340	7468820	uh, GT, uh, in G force GT six tens, do I really have to make sure I get a specific, you know,
7468820	7474740	one from a specific company or can I get any more salt and so long as it's a G force, I
7474740	7477140	don't think you need to, they're really all the same.
7477140	7482020	I mean, the only difference between those usually is just how fast the chips are clocked
7482020	7484900	and maybe what kind of, how much Rams in there.
7484900	7488880	But all that, I mean, there really is not going to be much of a difference between any
7488880	7489880	of them.
7489880	7490880	Just buy the cheapest one.
7490880	7491880	You can find.
7491880	7492880	Oh, all right.
7492880	7493880	All right.
7493880	7496800	This, this is going to end our call for help with Leo, the Roberts right now.
7496800	7498880	So thank you very much for the call.
7498880	7499880	Take care.
7499880	7500880	Yep.
7500880	7501880	Take care.
7501880	7502880	Yep.
7502880	7503880	All right.
7503880	7504880	Orange lounge radio, all one word on Skype.
7504880	7508420	If you'd like to give us a call, uh, or if not, I guess we can just get back to talking
7508420	7509420	amongst ourselves.
7509420	7512920	I think you have another, it turns out I do actually have a late breaking story.
7512940	7514340	Well, how about that?
7514340	7520340	Um, so team Ninja has announced to stop developing the dead or alive series on their live stream.
7520340	7522680	Wait, there's, they're no longer developing it.
7522680	7524540	That is what this Twitter post says.
7524540	7525540	Wow.
7525540	7526540	Yep.
7526540	7528140	So I guess that's no more volleyball.
7528140	7529140	Rest in peace.
7529140	7530140	That's wow.
7530140	7531600	I want to know more about what ended it.
7531600	7532600	What went into that?
7532600	7533940	Are they just making something else?
7533940	7536380	I mean, team Ninja isn't folding, right?
7536380	7540160	So it sounds like they're just going for other directions, but I didn't watch the live stream.
7540160	7542100	I only saw one Twitter post about it.
7542100	7543100	Interesting.
7543100	7544100	Let's get to the phones.
7544100	7545100	Hi.
7545100	7546100	You're on Orange lounge radio.
7546100	7547100	Who's this?
7547100	7548100	Hey, what's going on everyone?
7548100	7549100	It's Ronbo.
7549100	7550100	Uh, what's up buddy?
7550100	7551100	Not much.
7551100	7556260	I just finished watching one of my favorite holiday movies as a glorified musical.
7556260	7561180	So I have a question for everybody in the studio.
7561180	7562180	Okay.
7562180	7569320	What recent video game that you have played that you will love to see as a Broadway musical
7569320	7575960	that is so tacky, so bad, but it'll still be a guilty pleasure for you to watch any
7575960	7578800	time of the year?
7578800	7582720	Uh, a video game that should be a tacky Broadway musical.
7582720	7587560	Literally every game I play, literally every game you play Splatoon is, Oh my God, I split
7587560	7588920	hand to imagine actually.
7588920	7589920	Yeah.
7589920	7591640	That would be actually kind of fun, especially with that kind of music.
7591640	7596240	Like the like ska music, the musical style, plus just how much character like the narrators
7596240	7597240	have.
7598240	7599240	Callie, Marie, Marina.
7599240	7600240	Marina.
7600240	7601240	Yeah.
7601240	7602240	Why not?
7602240	7603240	That would be fun.
7603240	7604240	Two.
7604240	7605240	Okay.
7605240	7606240	One's not out yet.
7606240	7607240	So I'm gonna start with the one that is out.
7607240	7608240	No more heroes.
7608240	7609240	Okay.
7609240	7610240	Would be fucking balls.
7610240	7611240	Crazy.
7611240	7615840	And then the one that's going to top that of course obviously is going to be Death Stranding
7615840	7622200	because what the fuck would that be as a musical?
7622200	7627320	My two answers would be Super Mario Odyssey because you know, the one with the Pauline
7627320	7629800	singing and stuff would be fun, a little jazz there.
7629800	7633160	And then my other answer, which I thought like he was going to steal this would be Saints
7633160	7634160	Row.
7634160	7635160	Hello.
7635160	7636160	I'll be a hilarious musical.
7636160	7638480	They've done a Saints Row musical actually.
7638480	7639480	They're in Saints Row.
7639480	7641400	Then the script is already fucking done.
7641400	7644400	I think the one I would have picked would probably be Phoenix Wright, Ace Attorney.
7644400	7648280	How about you Dar Sakura video game that should be a Broadway musical?
7648280	7650880	I would say Breath of the Wild, but that's too easy.
7650880	7654980	So I'm going to pick Animal Crossing.
7654980	7659160	But it has to be all in that language.
7659160	7665920	I've brought you a fish, thanks for 500 bells.
7665920	7670000	How about a Broadway musical based on the Sims, but it's in Simlish.
7670000	7671000	No, no, no.
7671000	7674880	It has to be Animal Crossing because the Sims have already done like the redoing the songs.
7674880	7677400	I can't wait for the Rossetti song in that one.
7677920	7680680	But it'd be like, I need a new catchphrase.
7680680	7681680	Okay.
7681680	7682680	It's ass munch.
7682680	7684680	Thank you ass munch.
7684680	7687000	Rossetti would start after the intermission.
7687000	7689800	I think that's what should happen is that at the end of part A, the curtain just drops
7689800	7694880	and the Rossetti shows up after the intermission to give a long lecture about you lazy assholes
7694880	7698200	when you come to the theater, you should be able to sit through the whole performance
7698200	7701800	and you shouldn't just stop things in the middle of it so you can get a diet soda.
7701800	7705520	Don't you know the diet soda is bad for you and just go on and on like Rossetti does.
7705520	7706880	We need to start workshopping this.
7706880	7707880	Right.
7707880	7708880	That's right.
7708880	7709880	There you go.
7709880	7710880	And then we'll have Lyle trying to sell you insurance on your way out.
7710880	7716040	So look forward to Animal Crossing the musical and basically everyone at the concession
7716040	7718080	stand has to wear nookling masks.
7718080	7723880	And I think the whole thing has to be who fucking dug the pitfall in front of Barbara's
7723880	7724880	house.
7724880	7725880	Rob.
7725880	7729880	Who hit Ed with the shovel?
7729880	7734880	Well, I didn't have a bug net yet, so I hit him with shovel.
7734880	7735880	Oops.
7736880	7738600	Anyone want some glue?
7738600	7740480	How about some chat answers?
7740480	7743280	VidPower suggests Danganronpa the musical.
7743280	7745280	Oh my God.
7745280	7748480	Bob Coffee says Metal Gear Solid the musical.
7748480	7751520	It's just a cardboard box moving slowly down the stage.
7751520	7753680	Tigerclaw says Mega Man the musical.
7753680	7754680	Too many characters.
7754680	7760480	Come on, Kylie Minomis says how about a Stardew Valley musical?
7760480	7761480	That's a pretty good one.
7761480	7762480	I like that.
7762480	7765800	Tigerclaw says just how about World of Warcraft is a musical.
7766720	7771520	SSG100Matt says President Cat the musical would make more money than the game did.
7771520	7773200	And Undertale the musical.
7773200	7774200	Of course.
7774200	7775200	Oh God.
7775200	7777880	There'd already be a built-in Tumblr base to go see that.
7777880	7781300	By the way, Fifth Dream is following up on what you were talking about with the Dead
7781300	7782300	or Alive thing.
7782300	7783300	Just quickly here.
7783300	7787280	The developer explained Dead or Alive 5 has finally come to an end, but the Dead or Alive
7787280	7789320	team is very active.
7789320	7792560	It's time to stop what we're doing for now and look into the future.
7792560	7795520	So that doesn't really rule out Dead or Alive 6.
7795520	7800040	That just means no more costumes, which actually, did you see some of the dude costumes in Dead
7800040	7801040	or Alive 5?
7801040	7802160	No, but we'll trade images later.
7802160	7803160	Please go look them up.
7803160	7804160	Thank you.
7804160	7805160	Alright.
7805160	7807080	That definitely, well that's what happens when you use Twitter as a news source.
7807080	7809500	Well Rama, Imma flip it on ya.
7809500	7812640	What would be your video game musical?
7812640	7813640	Overwatch.
7813640	7814640	Overwatch.
7814640	7815640	That's a good one.
7815640	7816640	Oh, that's right.
7816640	7818600	There was a Saints Row musical.
7818600	7820460	Buggy Saints Row.
7820460	7821720	That's fucking amazing.
7821720	7824440	And yes, I would love Buggy Saints Row as a musical.
7824440	7825440	Go look it up.
7825440	7826680	I'll link it in chat.
7826680	7827680	There was.
7827680	7833520	I remember back in the all games days at one of those E3s that was at the big arena thing
7833520	7837380	in Santa Monica, they had a Mario Brothers Opera.
7837380	7840840	So somebody's kind of tried it.
7840840	7841840	For what it's worth.
7841840	7842840	I will point out.
7842840	7843840	Oh, sorry.
7843840	7844840	Oh yeah.
7844840	7849480	As Joe points out, the indie game Dominique Pamplemousse was the musical game.
7849480	7850480	That's right.
7850480	7851920	They're what, that was a musical.
7851920	7854600	It was a, it was also, it's a musical game.
7854600	7855600	And it was stop motion.
7855600	7856600	Yeah.
7856600	7857600	That was a pretty, that's a fun one.
7857600	7859760	I'm looking at some of these costumes and they're pretty crazy.
7859760	7860760	Good times.
7860760	7861760	All right, Rama.
7861760	7862760	Well, that was a fun question.
7862760	7863760	How was the Christmas story musical?
7863760	7867680	Should I bother watching it or?
7867680	7873160	The best way I can find it is it's Street Fighter bad, but good.
7873160	7874640	Street Fighter bad, but good.
7874640	7875640	Okay.
7875640	7876640	That's like, but now.
7876640	7877640	I enjoyed it.
7877640	7878640	You understood.
7878640	7881320	You understood they were not remaking the movie, right?
7881320	7882640	At first.
7882640	7886600	But then I was watching it and I totally forgot that there wasn't Broadway musical that I
7886600	7891620	wanted to see so badly, but Joe's got to be in consideration that I'm a little biased.
7891620	7897480	You're talking to somebody who sits here and watches the Christmas story marathon, at least
7897480	7904120	parts of it when they brought it for 24 hours, I have the 30th anniversary DVD on my shelf
7904120	7905760	that I watch every year.
7905760	7910600	I have a Blu-ray of the movie somewhere in my shelf that I watch.
7910600	7917840	I also have the terror really bad on Christmas story two Blu-ray that I also watch.
7917840	7920560	You have to understand, this is my guilty pleasure film.
7920560	7925040	Now do you know one of the next musicals that Fox is going to be doing?
7925040	7928680	I don't know if they advertised it, but do you know what is scheduled to air in January
7928680	7932520	of 2019?
7932520	7934520	Do you know what they're doing?
7934520	7935520	No.
7935520	7936520	Rent.
7936520	7938980	Oh my God.
7938980	7941220	This will not end well.
7941220	7942820	Yep.
7942820	7944660	So just look forward to that.
7944660	7949780	Fox brings you the studio that brought you A Christmas Story Live and the Rocky Horror
7949780	7953860	Picture Show, which was really the Rocky Horror Show, and they would have had a lot more people
7953860	7957220	on board if they just had said it was the Rocky Horror Show on television.
7957220	7961580	If they'd done that, it will be bringing you Rent Live in 2019, I'm sure many people are
7961580	7962580	thrilled to hear that.
7962580	7966700	They just need to have the Rocky Horror Show, but as an actual serial show, like The Muppet
7966700	7967700	Show.
7967700	7974820	It's the Dr. Frank converter show.
7974820	7979520	You should open one of the times you're hosting Rocky like that.
7979520	7980520	In a full Kermit thing.
7980520	7983760	Yeah, there's a whole Muppet Show parody, that'd be hilarious.
7983760	7985560	You know what?
7985560	7987380	The word time set something off for me.
7987380	7988380	Our time capsule.
7988380	7989600	We'll do it the first show, you're back.
7989600	7992660	If you're here for the New Year's thing, we'll do it then, if not, we'll do it the next show.
7992660	7993660	Okay.
7993660	7994660	Yeah.
7994660	7995660	I don't want to do it tonight.
7995660	7996660	Year's not over yet.
7996660	7997660	Fine.
7997660	8000420	She wants to open Christmas presents early and we can't do that.
8000420	8001420	All right.
8001420	8007220	So speaking of Mega Man, we still can't do it for the people that wanted a Mega Man musical.
8007220	8012580	If you look on YouTube, there's this guy who's done like lyrics to music to like, oh yeah,
8012580	8014920	there's one of us listen to every mega ran out.
8014920	8018860	So I mean, it doesn't exactly exist in musical form, but like that's a taste of it.
8018860	8019860	There you go.
8019860	8023400	I've done a lot of rental plus stuff for fortune cookie.
8023400	8024400	A lot.
8024400	8025400	She's done a lot.
8025400	8026400	All right.
8026440	8027440	I'll let you go, buddy.
8027440	8028440	But thanks for the call.
8028440	8029440	Uh, Rob.
8029440	8030440	What?
8030440	8035280	I just want you to know, you have said some really funny outlandish things to me and I
8035280	8040240	just bounced it back to you and we go back and forth, but after what you just said about
8040240	8048760	Fox doing rent, I'm just sitting here with my hands clasped, my face sitting on my, on
8048760	8054800	my clasped hands, just staring at my desk like Gendo Akari, I'm just like, okay, this
8054800	8058480	is what the gays call clutching your pearls.
8058480	8061160	I wouldn't call this clutching your pearls.
8061160	8065480	It's like, I'm thinking when this happens, we should go down to the studios and just
8065480	8070640	be there just in case if we have to clean house.
8070640	8072520	Or I'm just not going to turn the TV on.
8072520	8077400	It'll probably be on a Sunday night when OLR's going and let's be real like this show ain't
8077400	8082880	going to stop till Comcast blocks our internet thanks to net neutrality getting fucked.
8082880	8084840	So there it is.
8084840	8086920	I'll send you some of my Verizon fiber.
8086920	8088640	I'll put some, I'll put some support out.
8088640	8089640	All right.
8089640	8090640	Take care of my friend.
8090640	8091640	Thanks for the call.
8091640	8092640	Enjoy.
8092640	8093640	Bye.
8093640	8097040	Uh, Orange Launch Radio, all one word on Skype if anyone else wants to sneak through.
8097040	8101360	Meanwhile, anybody else in the studio have a tidbit, something for us to talk about?
8101360	8102360	No.
8102360	8103360	No?
8103360	8104360	Dying down there.
8104360	8105360	Let's see.
8105360	8106760	I'm looking at chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
8106760	8108440	Uh, let's see.
8108640	8112960	Brad from Pod Culture has some strong feelings saying a Christmas story is the fucking worst
8112960	8114680	movie ever.
8114680	8116760	I worked Suncoast during the holidays.
8116760	8119040	That goddamn DVD was always in.
8119040	8120700	It needs to die.
8120700	8123000	There are people that feel strongly about a Christmas story.
8123000	8128080	I think I remember that movie growing up, like we used to, when I was growing up, we
8128080	8132440	would watch that movie like on Christmas Eve, like all the time.
8132440	8139920	But the problem was when everybody who was seven became 30, then it was like, now you
8139920	8141520	fucking can't get away from it.
8141520	8142520	It's everywhere.
8142520	8146240	So I see why people get a little bit like jaded about it.
8146240	8150040	But for, especially for the time, it was, it was funny.
8150040	8151040	It's a good movie.
8151040	8152320	I actually don't know if I know it.
8152320	8153320	A Christmas story.
8153320	8154320	Do you know?
8154320	8155320	You'll shoot your eye out.
8155320	8156320	Do you know that line?
8156320	8157320	Okay.
8157320	8158320	He's hesitating.
8158320	8159320	So that means he's never seen it.
8159320	8160320	I hate that movie, by the way.
8160320	8161320	So you're with Brad from Pod Culture.
8161320	8162320	It just really bugs me.
8163200	8165520	It's just not fun to watch.
8165520	8168000	Is it because they did too much of it?
8168000	8169800	Like it got, cause you know, they're okay.
8169800	8170800	Let me put it this way.
8170800	8174400	There's some people that don't like Star Wars, you know, which people are so wrong.
8174400	8179440	Marathon Star Wars for a full day, like on a certain channel every year.
8179440	8180440	Are you sure?
8180440	8181440	All right.
8181440	8184560	Which, by the way, don't worry about Star Wars spoilers.
8184560	8186040	Cause like none of us saw it.
8186040	8187520	No, wait, look, you saw it, right?
8187520	8188520	You know better though.
8188520	8189720	The rest of us didn't even bother seeing it.
8189720	8191280	So I don't hate Star Wars.
8191280	8193800	I just, I was not going to fight that theater crowd this weekend.
8193800	8194800	No ma'am.
8194800	8195800	I will.
8195800	8196800	Here's the thing though.
8196800	8198240	Like on, I took Friday off to go see stars.
8198240	8201040	I was actually going to see Star Wars and Thor, but after watching Star Wars, I got
8201040	8203040	burnt out just watching movies.
8203040	8206400	I'm like, I can't sit for another like two and a half hours through a movie.
8206400	8207560	It'll just waste my whole day.
8207560	8209160	I heard it's a long movie.
8209160	8210160	That's not a spoiler, right?
8210160	8212040	We can say it's long, long movie.
8212040	8216280	It doesn't, the pacing of it, it, it feels like if you actually looked at like all this
8216280	8220360	stuff on paper, it doesn't seem like much happens, but it, it was good.
8220360	8221360	I liked it.
8221360	8223920	It wasn't like, Oh my God, this is the most amazing thing ever.
8223920	8226560	But it wasn't like, Oh, I hate this thing.
8226560	8228560	Tiger class says it's two hours and 32 minutes.
8228560	8231120	So yeah, I mean it was fine.
8231120	8233800	There was, I liked it.
8233800	8237480	I mean, I don't know.
8237480	8238480	There's not much to say.
8238480	8239480	Just go see it.
8239480	8245880	But I see, I was lucky though, cause like our theaters nearby, they were open like fucking
8245880	8246880	early.
8246880	8248520	I mean, they had like, I saw it at nine o'clock.
8248520	8249520	They were running 24 hours.
8249520	8250520	Yeah.
8250520	8251880	I saw it at nine o'clock in the morning.
8251880	8256280	So I got that out of the way and went, finished Christmas shopping.
8256280	8261680	We were going to finally go see lady bird yesterday, but I took a nap instead.
8261680	8263800	But what we did, we were, we had some time to kill yesterday.
8263800	8267800	So I took you over to where some of the houses are in that movie because I know some of the
8267800	8272080	famous houses that are in that movie or in what they call the fab forties here in SAC.
8272080	8274160	And that's also where all the Christmas lights are this time of year.
8274160	8275880	So Oh my God, the traffic was terrible.
8275880	8276880	Yeah.
8277320	8280360	We didn't go down 40th or 41st, which are the worst.
8280360	8284280	We went down like 43rd and I was like, here's, here's the experience.
8284280	8285280	Like light.
8285280	8286280	Yeah.
8286280	8292080	And that was one of those courts by my house and it backs up traffic everywhere.
8292080	8294180	Do they synchronize with music and everything?
8294180	8295180	Only one of them.
8295180	8299120	Like they're all, it's like, it's basically all the people that live in this court, it's,
8299120	8301080	you have to put out lights every year.
8301080	8305480	And so like one of my coworkers actually that's in our department, he lives on that court
8305680	8311020	and he is talking about, I mean he likes doing it, he likes Christmas and stuff, but yeah,
8311020	8314760	it's insane because it's like, okay, y'all take me 30 minutes to get to my house from
8314760	8315760	the end of my court.
8315760	8316760	Oh geez.
8316760	8318680	Cause it's just moving so slow.
8318680	8319680	Yeah.
8319680	8323400	I'm so glad I live in an apartment where I don't have any pressure to decorate.
8323400	8324400	What was the other movie?
8324400	8326800	I said we should go see, Oh, the disaster artists, but you didn't, you didn't know what
8326800	8327800	the room was.
8327800	8328800	Right.
8328800	8329800	I've never seen the room.
8329800	8330800	Yeah.
8330800	8331800	So I want to see that too.
8332120	8335840	If I'm going to see a movie about a disaster, I want it to be about Aja.
8335840	8338160	All right.
8338160	8339440	Well I guess our phones are not lighting up.
8339440	8341080	I still want to see the shape of water.
8341080	8342080	Yeah.
8342080	8343080	You were mentioning that.
8343080	8344080	Very, very much.
8344080	8345080	Yeah.
8345080	8346080	Is Call Me By Your Name playing in Sacramento?
8346080	8349140	Cause I've heard a lot of good things about that, but I know it's an independent film
8349140	8350140	so it might be hard to buy.
8350140	8352440	Well believe it or not, Sacramento has indie theaters.
8352440	8354160	Do you have landmark?
8354160	8356560	There's the, no, there's Tower and Crest are the two.
8356560	8358600	Well actually Crest doesn't really show stuff anymore.
8358600	8360920	They have a single screen, so like it's harder.
8361040	8362240	The Tower has three screens.
8362240	8363240	Yeah.
8363240	8365400	Tower was where I saw, I've seen some crazy movies there.
8365400	8366400	Okay.
8366400	8369080	So, and you, you, you, whatever movie, I know we're getting Sacramento right now, but any,
8369080	8371360	any theater city you live in has an art theater.
8371360	8372360	Right?
8372360	8373360	Right.
8373360	8375240	That's where I saw a short bus was the Tower Theater.
8375240	8378280	No wait, no, I saw that at the Crest.
8378280	8380200	I saw that with you.
8380200	8381200	That's right.
8381200	8384400	And my old roommate, we all went, no, that was at the Crest, not the, not the, in the
8384400	8385400	basement at the Crest.
8385400	8387040	Cause I know I brought the screen.
8387040	8388040	Yeah.
8388040	8390720	That, that was the one that was by the Hedwig and the Angry Inch director, but it was like
8390720	8392000	super porn.
8392000	8396680	Like it was just a movie that happened to have like, yeah, it was, it was, it was actually
8396680	8397680	a good movie.
8397680	8400280	It had the guy sucking his own dick.
8400280	8401280	Yes it did.
8401280	8403280	It was a good movie.
8403280	8404280	No.
8404280	8405280	Yeah.
8405280	8406280	And that's the weird thing about it.
8406280	8409320	Like you can say that I've ever seen auto fellatio that you can say that and still go,
8409320	8413660	but like actually it was a good movie, but I was the only one, see the controversial
8413660	8417440	thing about it is that everybody walked away going, it was a happy ending and I actually
8417440	8419800	walked out of there going, I actually thought that was like one of the saddest movies I've
8419880	8420880	ever seen.
8420880	8421880	Yeah.
8421880	8422880	Yeah.
8422880	8425360	So everybody kind of gets different things out of that.
8425360	8428000	So there you go.
8428000	8432160	So a lot of these artsy movies though, since you kind of got us on that topic, a lot of
8432160	8436780	the artsy movies don't really show up till January because they're just coming out limited
8436780	8438780	engagement so they can qualify for the Oscars.
8438780	8441760	Like I don't know if that call me by your name is going to be eligible for it.
8441760	8445520	Like if they're talking about Oscars for it or whatever, it's been out definitely in theaters
8445520	8446600	in December.
8446600	8449420	So if that's what they're doing, then it would qualify.
8449420	8452680	So Tower has Darkest Hour, which I haven't heard of that.
8452680	8453800	That's Gary Oldman.
8453800	8457240	They have Lady Bird, but that makes sense because Tower Theater is in that movie.
8457240	8459380	And then Three Billboards Outside Ebbing.
8459380	8461060	Oh, I've heard of that one too.
8461060	8462060	Yeah.
8462060	8463060	That is there too.
8463060	8464060	And then I don't know if the Crest is even on the list.
8464060	8466940	I know Crest is on the list, but they don't have anything today.
8466940	8471060	The Crest now like sticks to like one time shows, like they'll show It's a Wonderful
8471060	8472940	Life at some point during the season.
8472940	8476500	They're kind of like the Castro theater, but like not as cool.
8476500	8478100	Well, of course not.
8478100	8479820	It's not in the gay neighborhood.
8479820	8481300	Oh yeah.
8481300	8482300	Tiger Claw.
8482300	8483300	That's the other movie I want to see.
8483300	8484300	I, Tonya.
8484300	8485300	The one about Tonya Harding.
8485300	8488020	I live for Tonya Harding, Nancy Kerrigan's Scandal.
8488020	8489620	There's a great documentary on Netflix.
8489620	8491700	You've heard the Seshvan Stevens song.
8491700	8492900	Yes, the Tonya Harding.
8492900	8496380	Which was not actually part of the movie, but he wrote it around the same time and they
8496380	8497380	didn't use it.
8497380	8498380	Yeah.
8498380	8499380	Why not?
8499380	8500380	Why not write a song about Tonya Harding?
8500380	8503120	I mean, I think they just didn't need it, but he wanted to do it anyway.
8503120	8505620	So he's going to do what he's going to do.
8506140	8509420	Anyhow, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
8509420	8512420	I think we've really covered it all tonight.
8512420	8513420	Thank you guys.
8513420	8518160	And no matter what it is you celebrate this holiday season, we hope you have a great holiday.
8518160	8522220	We will see you again live in January in a few weeks.
8522220	8527060	Meanwhile, for our podcast listeners, we will be, which hopefully are the live listeners
8527060	8530900	too, we will be joining you for a special episode at some point during the break.
8530900	8534220	Hey, if you liked what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, be sure to leave us a five star
8534260	8538260	review on a site like iTunes or wherever it is you found this podcast, because word of
8538260	8539540	mouth is all we've got.
8539540	8542780	So you don't have to send us hazelnut Oreos like Act Def did.
8542780	8544280	You can just leave us a really nice review.
8544280	8549060	And that is a Christmas present or a Hanukkah present or whatever it is you want in December
8549060	8551340	present that we can all enjoy.
8551340	8553940	In fact, presents actually don't have to be limited to December.
8553940	8555060	You know, there you go.
8555060	8557780	You can, an unbirthday present can be any time of year.
8557780	8558780	JD, thank you for being here tonight.
8558780	8559780	Thank you for having me.
8559780	8560780	Hope you had a good time.
8560780	8562300	Oh, it's always a blast.
8562300	8563300	It's always fun.
8563620	8565820	What do people need to know about the experience of being here?
8565820	8569100	Like, because you listen to this when you're not here and then you're here.
8569100	8572420	What do people that are listening that have ever been here need to know about the being
8572420	8574120	here experience?
8574120	8575120	It's really hard to describe.
8575120	8578660	I don't, I'd have to, I'd have to think about that one before answering it.
8578660	8579660	That's a very good non-answer.
8579660	8580660	All right.
8580660	8585860	We've, we've been giggling though, like little school girls over here at Drag Queens.
8585860	8590060	Although this picture that I just posted of Raja is glorious.
8590100	8591820	Dungeon Buster says, thanks for an epic year.
8591820	8593820	OLR, rock on safely into the holidays.
8593820	8594820	Hey, will do.
8594820	8595820	Uh, 2018.
8595820	8598420	I know we don't want to get too much into like resolutions and stuff.
8598420	8602380	We'll talk about that on our bonus show, but I definitely am going to get back into streaming.
8602380	8604180	It's just, you guys know it's been a bad year for me.
8604180	8607460	So, but I really do have fun when I do streaming, so I'm going to, I'm actually going to try
8607460	8611060	and do the schedule thing, which can be a little weird for me, but there might be some
8611060	8614860	new podcast projects in 2018 to Jamie and I've been talking about something for a long
8614860	8615860	time.
8616220	8621220	My buddy, my buddy Victoria is like hell bent on making something happen and I think she'd
8621220	8622220	be really good.
8622220	8624420	She's kind of one of those people who doesn't have a podcast right now who kind of needs
8624420	8625420	one.
8625420	8626580	So I'm looking forward to that.
8626580	8629420	So anyway, uh, that's going to do it.
8629420	8632940	Let's go around and get everybody's final fricking thoughts for the year.
8632940	8634820	I guess final live thoughts for the year.
8634820	8635820	Anyway.
8635820	8637580	Uh, JD, do you have anything we should let our guests go first?
8637580	8639580	You have a final thought?
8639580	8643020	Um, no, I don't have anything right away.
8643020	8644020	All right.
8644020	8645020	That's fine.
8645180	8646180	Final thought tonight.
8646180	8652380	I'm worried I lost my dongle for my new phone because no, because I got a, I got pixel two
8652380	8657140	today so I upgraded my Samsung galaxy S six to a pixel two and they, since it doesn't
8657140	8662380	have a headphone jack, it has a dongle for it and Jack and I was like, man, I gotta find
8662380	8666380	a place to put this so I don't lose it and I put it, I thought I put in my back pocket
8666380	8669780	so I don't, maybe I didn't bring it to the show because I didn't think I was going to
8669780	8673620	be using my headphones, but that's going to be a real issue because I know I'm going to
8673620	8677660	lose that thing and also like, I guess I have to zip tie it to my headphones I use
8677660	8680420	because that's really the only, I've heard the apple one is cheaper if you need to buy
8680420	8681420	a replacement.
8681420	8687740	Well, it's used to be type C. That's a fun, well, Loki, sorry about your dongle, but I
8687740	8688920	love my new phone.
8688920	8689920	It's super snappy.
8689920	8690920	All right.
8690920	8695900	Uh, my final thought for the night is just thank you guys.
8695900	8700300	I know it's been a, an up and down year just, you know, for obviously for me personally,
8700300	8704260	but it's affected the show and we've gone like several weeks without some shows and
8704260	8707180	I really hate to do that, but I just, I really want to thank you guys who've like stuck by
8707180	8711460	us through the crazy fucking year that is 2017.
8711460	8716560	Um, and we're going to carry this show on into 2018 and who fucking knows when we're
8716560	8717820	going to run out of steam.
8717820	8718820	Who knows?
8718820	8719820	We haven't yet.
8719820	8724660	Well, not anytime soon cause dark soccer just got a steam gift card, but anyway, last but
8724660	8727220	not least, we're going to be posting from the grave anyway.
8727220	8729820	The OLR way here at the end of the show.
8729820	8731420	Ladies last.
8731420	8732420	Your final thought.
8732420	8734020	Save the best for last.
8734020	8735020	Sure.
8735020	8736020	Um, right.
8736020	8737580	Um, act deft.
8737580	8744700	I love you for the gift of hazelnut and um, reject false icons next year.
8744700	8745700	New year.
8745700	8746700	New me.
8746700	8747700	All right.
8747700	8748700	We'll see you next time.
8748700	8749700	New, new year.
8749700	8750700	New OLR.
8750700	8751700	New, new lol.
8751700	8752700	No, no.
8752700	8753700	That doesn't work.
8753700	8754700	New Orleans.
8754700	8755700	New Orleans.
