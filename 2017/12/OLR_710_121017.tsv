0	7000	Orange Lounge Radio
7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	27000	This week we've learned that Pokemon feign apparently due to quote, extreme weather against their frail bodies. What onyx wants moss growing on the north facing side anyway? This is just one story in tonight's news of a war, law, and more and it all starts right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	45000	Hello my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight, episode number 710 for this December the 10th of 2017.
45000	59000	My name is Rob Roberts, here with you over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle. If you want, you can follow me on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E. And if you want, you can follow her on Twitter at DarkSakura O-L-R, right? DarkSakura underscore O-R.
59000	61000	No, it's just DarkSakura.
61000	63000	Oh, is it on Twitter it is?
63000	69000	My YouTube is DarkSakura O-L-R, which doesn't have really any content other than Julian saying Dalek when he was 3.
69000	71000	That would have a million views I would think.
71000	73000	No, it has like 20.
73000	75000	Well, how are you DarkSakura?
75000	77000	I'm feeling better now that I've got food in me.
77000	79000	I'm glad you're feeling good. I was sick all week.
79000	81000	I'm sorry.
81000	83000	Who had to go to the Ingress thing last week, Rob?
83000	87000	Yes, I did the Ingress thing last week and clearly I caught something there. Well, you guys didn't get sick luckily.
87000	89000	You run all these diseased people.
89000	99000	But I'm actually kind of happy we had the shorter show last week because once you guys left, and you know sometimes I'll do Twitch streaming after the show, but I was like, I just don't know if I feel it last week.
100000	104000	And then sure enough after you guys left I'm like, uh oh, scratchy throat, sniffly nose.
104000	108000	And then I wake up Monday morning and it's just like, dun dun dun, you're sick.
108000	111000	And it's like these symptoms, I can't shake them at all.
111000	114000	Clearly, he caught the Jarvis virus.
117000	119000	Uh, leave.
121000	125000	And that's the shit I've been putting up with for over 15 years over there from Techmaster Loki.
125000	127000	I hope you're not feeling like crap like I've been.
127000	135000	No, I just have a minor cold, I guess. It's just like the end of a minor cold, so no, I'm okay.
135000	142000	I've actually been kind of tired, but I'm sticking to it because I will be off work for a month at the end of the year.
142000	144000	Oh boy. Alright.
144000	150000	And I actually may miss a couple of shows after that, so I'll go ahead and let everyone know for the five people who appreciate me on this show.
150000	151000	Oh, stop.
151000	154000	Well, I'm sorry, I have to go in the kitchen and make a sandwich.
155000	157000	Oh yeah, that was the Twitter thing.
157000	160000	And I'm still mocking them 15 years later.
160000	165000	Yeah, actually, if Jamie were to make you a sandwich, she'd be pretty lucky. She's a pretty good cook.
165000	168000	But she's under no obligation to do any such thing.
168000	171000	But that's right, next weekend we'll have to make latkes.
171000	172000	Oh yeah.
172000	174000	It's the Hanukkah latke fest.
174000	175000	Yeah, latke show.
175000	176000	Yay!
176000	187000	I have to mention, my kids like watching crap on Netflix, and they have all the holiday shows or episodes for different shows on Netflix, so one of those is home.
187000	191000	And they have a song in there called Eight Days of Latkes.
191000	192000	Oh, that sounds great.
192000	196000	It's fucking awesome. It's just a hilarious song, but I thought of you.
196000	197000	Oh.
197000	201000	So you said there you wanted to let the five thousand people that like you know.
201000	203000	Five.
203000	204000	Hundred thousand.
204000	205000	Whatever.
205000	213000	So yeah, I'll be off the show for a couple weeks, but it's nothing, you know, crazy. It'll just be, I'll be recovering from some surgery. That's all.
213000	215000	All right. Well, we'll miss you.
215000	218000	What will you throw? Will you throw latkes at me?
218000	219000	Sure.
219000	220000	Okay.
220000	229000	I am scheduling, just so you know, in your absence, I am working on, I need to figure out what days specifically you're not going to be here, but I am working on that Babes of Ingress edition when you're not here.
229000	233000	I'm actually kind of bummed you won't be here, but I wanted to have some strong females on the show.
233000	235000	Maybe I can do a phone in.
235000	236000	Yeah, of course. That would be fun.
236000	240000	If I'm not, you know, feeling like bleh.
240000	246000	All right. Well, anyway, let's get into video games because we are a show that talks about video games and culture and all that.
246000	247000	And food.
247000	258000	And once in a while, food. And I know I talk about this. I kind of repeat this story every few months, but with as long as this show has been around and the discoverability of this and the word of mouth and everything.
258000	263000	I know sometimes you guys find OLR. You know, you may not have even realized this show has been around as long as it has.
263000	268000	We're like a really good kept secret on the internet. Like a really, really, really good kept secret.
268000	270000	Because like, we're everyone's sassy aunt.
270000	272000	Like Jamie said, only five people really know.
272000	279000	But no, we love our chatters. There's much more than five of you there in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
279000	284000	We do tape live, of course, every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at the Voice Geeks Network.
284000	289000	vognetwork.com where you can find lots of hidden secret great podcasts over there, such as The Geek Card.
289000	292000	It's just back from hiatus. Shout out to The Geek Card.
292000	296000	Lovely duo over there from Europe that talks about a lot of different geeky things.
296000	298000	And let's see, what other show am I going to spotlight?
298000	300000	Oh, Electric Sisterhood. I don't talk about them enough.
300000	303000	I love those two girls, though, and they talk about video games as well.
303000	307000	But there's tons of room for lots of video gaming shows on the network.
307000	312000	So, oh, I have to give one more shout out because I'm not sure if I'm supposed to say this,
312000	314000	but it was on social media and it wasn't marked private.
314000	319000	So congratulations to Captain Spike at Game Buoy because he got engaged.
319000	323000	All right. So those are some shows at VOG Network.
323000	328000	But the story I like to tell every few months here at OLR or so is how we all met.
328000	330000	Because where did Orange Launch Radio come from?
330000	332000	Why are you called Orange Launch Radio?
332000	339000	Because myself, DarkSakura, Loki, we all played a game called Dance Dance Revolution at the arcades.
339000	346000	And this was back in the day when arcades actually had people that visited them regularly for not ticket-spitting games.
346000	348000	And we didn't give a shit if y'all were on our lawn.
348000	352000	You had fans of street-fighting games.
352000	355000	Dude, SVGL was Capcom's test place.
355000	357000	So that was like rival schools.
357000	363000	Racing games, because that's right when like, not Wangan, but the other one.
363000	365000	Initial D. Why can't I remember that?
365000	367000	That's like right when Initial D was starting to take off and all that.
367000	371000	So you had racing games, fighting games, other types of games, and music games.
371000	379000	So we all met playing a game called Dance Dance Revolution, which was a part of a series by a video game company.
379000	383000	You all know, unfortunately, in the past couple of years, it's mostly negative reasons,
383000	386000	but Konami used to be a very different company.
386000	389000	They had more offices, more production teams, and so forth.
389000	395000	And they were responsible for a lot of these different types of games that they put under a series called Bomani.
395000	399000	Well, the reason why I bring all of this up this week and tell this story again,
399000	402000	even though I'm a broken record to some of you long-time listeners,
402000	408000	is that Bomani actually turned 20 years old this past week.
408000	414000	Because the original Beatmania, so that was the very first game that started the whole thing off.
415000	423000	Bomani, Beatmania, get it right? So Beatmania came out December 10, 1997.
423000	424000	I'm sorry, 98, that's right.
424000	428000	No, no, 97, because it's 20 years old. DDR came out in 98.
428000	432000	That's right, I was playing BM98, because that was one of the...
432000	433000	Like the simulators, right?
433000	434000	Yeah, so yeah.
434000	437000	No, but the original Beatmania, and it's so close to the end of the year too,
437000	442000	but technically the original Beatmania was December of 1997, so it turned 20 years old this past week.
442000	446000	So I thought it would be worth acknowledging that here at the top of the show,
446000	451000	that this series, that this show basically owes its thanks to.
451000	457000	And if you didn't know, Orange Lounge is the name of one of the in-house bands that did songs in DDR.
457000	462000	And so we kind of picked that as our name because not only the ties to Bomani Games,
462000	466000	which we were exclusively talking about in those first few years of the show,
466000	470000	but just the fact that we're lounging around talking about games, I don't know.
470000	476000	Does that kind of still work? Do you picture us all kind of in big orange furniture talking about games,
476000	479000	even though the furniture actually really is an orange? Spoiler alert.
479000	483000	But it could be. I did find an orange couch not that long ago, and I thought about it.
483000	487000	I really thought about it. Anyway, let's see.
489000	492000	We're going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
492000	496000	S2100 Matt says, Golfland was the place back in the day.
496000	502000	I know Mesa Golfland got a lot of things early. Yeah, there was more Golflands a few years ago, too.
502000	504000	Some of them have closed since then.
504000	509000	ActDeft points out the song 1998 in DDR Extreme.
509000	514000	Yes, but that is because of DDR's anniversary, which was the next year where Dance Dance Revolution came from.
514000	520000	But without BeatMania, we would not have Dance Dance Revolution or anything that really came after that,
520000	522000	which DDR is really still out there today.
522000	527000	I know it kind of hibernated for a few years, but there's been some more recent mixes lately,
527000	532000	and there's kind of a whole bunch of new community that's really into this DDR ace.
532000	536000	I know they're doing an old-school freestyle tournament next month I talked about a few weeks ago,
536000	539000	so I'm very excited to check that out in January in San Jose.
539000	541000	So, yeah, lots to get excited about.
541000	543000	Anyway, before we get into some of the more current gaming news,
543000	547000	because I know we want to get into the game awards and some of those announcements and so forth,
547000	555000	I want to just quickly kind of ask, how did my co-hosts, how did you guys get introduced to BeatMania or whatever music game it was?
555000	563000	How did you get introduced to it, which ultimately led you basically to finding each other at Golf Land where this show came from? Loki.
563000	570000	I think I saw a DDR fourth mix at an anime expo.
570000	574000	So I saw it at Fanime. They had it set up in an arcade room.
574000	576000	I was like, what the hell is that? I'm like, I've never seen anything like that.
576000	580000	And they bought the soundtrack, and I just kind of got interested in it.
580000	584000	And then I ended up in the arcade, and there was.
584000	586000	How about you, DarkSagra?
586000	593000	I first heard of BeatMania when I was still living in Alabama, because I moved out here in 98.
593000	597000	No, 99. I take that back. I moved out here in 99.
597000	604000	And then I had gotten into playing BM98, so I had the little emulator,
604000	608000	you know, where I was playing a lot of BM98, and I really enjoyed it. It had all the songs.
608000	614000	And then I moved out here. Was it 98 I moved out? Yeah, I think it was 98 that I moved out here. Anyway.
614000	626000	And then I don't even know what it was, but I think it was the very next year was when Dan got me second mix for my birthday on Dreamcast.
627000	635000	Yeah, it had to have been somewhere. Yeah, somewhere around there, because we already had our import Dreamcast for a while.
635000	643000	I may be getting my ears kind of mixed up because I'm old, but I had I had gone on this rampage hunting down DVR machines,
643000	649000	and there was the one at Country Club Lanes, and then they eventually got one at Crestview Lanes.
649000	655000	And Crestview is like, wait, how did that was also the only place I've ever seen a Blazing Star arcade machine short of California Extreme.
655000	663000	But yeah, I just like really got into it. And then I started getting into all the other Bemani. So the effort for me, it started with BeatMania.
663000	668000	First time I ever met you. First time I ever met you is when we took a road trip from here in SAC.
668000	678000	Some of us DVR players. We took a road trip to Milpitas Golf Land. I think it was to play Pata Pata Paradise, whatever, which had just come out or at least made it over here.
678000	685000	I stayed up all night watching videos to learn some of the dances. I love it. Yeah, that's awesome. I only need like half of them.
685000	693000	I don't remember the I actually don't remember the very first time I met Loki. I think it was just some random Roseville Golf Land night, because I think that's just kind of where we connected.
693000	698000	Probably thanks to DVR Freak. So I just remember what this is really the early days of O.L.R.
698000	707000	But I remember, which will always crack me up to this day, the contest that you did, because you used to be able to edit step files on a PlayStation one version of the game.
707000	711000	You could actually bring your memory card and plug it in. Well, we were to that distribution play.
711000	716000	Yeah. When Loki worked for the video distribution place, he used to have all these like Skinemax films that he would just get for free.
716000	722000	You know, so he did a contest once called Make Edit, Get Porn. Yes. It was a part of O.L.R.
722000	729000	I think we covered it in the early, early episodes. So you did the Make Edit, Get Porn contest and that that skinny guy, Dave, won, right?
729000	732000	Yeah. Which I wonder what ever happened to that kid. There's so many people from the early days.
732000	740000	O.L.R. I have no idea where they went these days. Yeah. Or I'll see. I'll see people like Puppy. You remember Puppy? He's coming to the show all the time.
740000	748000	Like I see him and his daughter and I'm like, wait a minute, you used to be the young kid that was always on the show.
748000	753000	He does a lot of really cool like Star Wars stuff now. He can actually like lightsaber battle.
753000	756000	That's cool. I'm going to have to do like a where, where are they now?
756000	759000	Dark Tetsuya did a pretty good one when our show turned 10.
759000	764000	But I need to get like some audio or some video of some like the where are they now of the early O.L.R. people.
764000	772000	I still have the memory card with my another edit on it for.
772000	781000	Crap, I don't even remember what song it was, but I knew it was called Another because I made the steps go with the rhythm of the another version of music.
781000	786000	And so I actually used that one. Now that I think about it, I think Sinon was the one that that beat it.
786000	791000	I don't remember what his nickname was on DDR freak. But I said, if anyone can beat it, I'll buy them a tenner.
791000	797000	He beat it. I saw my memory cards there in a pouch. I know exactly where they are, actually.
797000	802000	I have my Final Fantasy 7 save card, which was on a third party one that didn't lose all of its files.
802000	807000	I can still kill Aerith over and over. S2-100 Matt in chat says Drew is still the intern.
807000	812000	He is. He'll always be the intern. But he kind of grew up at some point. He's my coworker. Yeah, right.
812000	818000	Yeah, he grew up at some point. Anyway, Drew was a reference for my job. Quickly, my story.
818000	826000	I first saw it. So here's the funny thing. I randomly ended up at Milpitas Golf Land because Milpitas is right next to Fremont.
826000	836000	And I was in Fremont because I was part of a live shadow cast screening of Shock Treatment, which is the not quite sequel to the Rocky Horror Picture Show.
836000	843000	So they actually released a few years later a movie called Shock Treatment. And once in a blue moon, you'll find a group crazy enough to actually do a shadow cast of it.
843000	850000	So anyway, so I was in the fridge. So my friend and I were like, let's go to this arcade that's nearby. And it was huge. I remember.
850000	857000	So we dipped in there and I remember seeing the machine and people were doing crazy shit like doing like the matrix walks and the flips and stuff.
857000	865000	I'm almost positive because it was Memorial Day weekend. I think we walked into during a DDR tournament during like the first Milpitas tournament.
865000	876000	I think we walked into that. And so that's kind of how I was introduced to DDR. But it wasn't until a year later when I was in Las Vegas again for Rocky Horror Picture Show.
876000	886000	This is the Rocky Horror Picture Show 25th anniversary, which by the way, the movie is now 42. But this is the 20. Actually, I think it's older than that. No, 42. It was the 25th.
886000	888000	It is now the meaning of life.
888000	897000	It was the Hard Rock Hotel, but we were staying at because we were all young 20 somethings. We were fucking broke. So we were staying at Circus Circus. Like what?
897000	903000	So Circus Circus is neat. Don't knock it. I don't know. You don't go there in your 30s if you don't have kids.
903000	908000	I did. Did you? I think it's so gross now. I don't like Circus Circus at all.
908000	914000	Because I went with Jessica one time when we were still associating. And we actually went to that Circus Circus a couple of times.
914000	922000	The one in Vegas or the one in Reno? The one in Vegas. Because we went to watch the performers. I cleaned out their crane games and we went to play DDR in the basement.
922000	929000	Maybe I'm just being not nice. And then we drunk called you. Because I always think of the one in Reno, which is not quite as nice.
929000	936000	But then we drunk called you and that was funny. I know. I know. Anyway, so anyway, the point is, I don't know if it's still there, but they had this place called the Adventure Dome.
936000	946000	That was where all the arcade stuff was. So we were in the arcade and we saw this DDR machine. Jessica was there with me who used to be on Understation Live here on this network.
946000	952000	She actually, better known in the DDR community as Iguana Girl, she ran those boards on DDR Freak for a few years.
952000	960000	So anyway, her and I actually first saw this machine. It was like we were just kind of staring at it with hearts in our eyes going, we gotta play this.
961000	972000	That was right when I was playing Busta Groove in the US. I know, but that's what we called it. We were playing Busta Groove 2 all the time.
972000	981000	So we saw this game and you get hooked. It's like Busta Groove in real life. Kinda. That's kind of what it was.
981000	995000	And, you know, we saw the game over there and, you know, we hear the little, you know, you know, like the cheesy, you can't help but love DDR music the first time you hear it. You just really can't.
995000	1007000	I'm actually trying to remember what my first DDR machine was. I know what my first DDR machine was. It was Anime Expo 2000, I think it was, where it was the Disneyland Hotel.
1007000	1018000	And it was also the year of the chair. You know, the year that everyone started screaming for the chair because there was a chair left on stage. And we camped out in the room playing Third Mix.
1020000	1029000	Yeah, you guys stayed up all night. I know, I know. But mine was the original DDR that I guess got imported. But it's this song. It's this fucking song.
1029000	1031000	That was actually manufactured for the US market.
1031000	1032000	It's this song.
1033000	1042000	That was the first song I saw. Not Butterfly, but actually I remember now seeing someone playing Beatmania and they were playing Metal Gear Solid.
1042000	1045000	And I was like, oh man, that's so awesome, I gotta get that.
1045000	1053000	You know what made me feel kinda old on that particular event with the Third Mix? Was walking around singing along with Xanadu because I was super happy.
1053000	1059000	Because I'm one of seven people in the world that like Xanadu. And I was singing along with it and my friend's like, I thought you never played this before.
1060000	1064000	You bitch. This movie is old, okay? It was old then.
1065000	1067000	What is Mr. Smoosh doing?
1067000	1068000	He's playing in bags.
1068000	1070000	And then I discovered the Olivia Project.
1071000	1072000	So anyway, I never finished my story.
1072000	1073000	Sorry.
1073000	1074000	No, that's okay. The end of my story is-
1074000	1075000	Not sorry.
1075000	1079000	It's gonna be one of those nights here at OLR. Let's just be real. It always is one of those nights at OLR.
1080000	1091000	The fact is, we started playing this game and we couldn't fucking stop playing. We just played all fucking night and suddenly it was- we missed Shock Treatment.
1091000	1095000	Again, it always comes back to this fucking movie Shock Treatment that ruined my life.
1096000	1100000	We missed the Shock Treatment screening on Friday because we were playing DDR all fucking night.
1100000	1112000	So that's the end of the story. I think I went on this new tool called the internet and I found out that Roseville Golf Land had a DDR machine so I just kind of went over there.
1113000	1118000	Princess Irene, I'm pretty sure, was a part of this too. We all went over there and that's when we met the rest of you and OLR started from there.
1119000	1128000	Friends with- crap, why can't I remember her name now? Who ended up marrying your ex-roommate?
1128000	1130000	Oh yeah, that whole thing. Those people, yes.
1131000	1139000	But that's where I met her. And that also led to me meeting more people too. And then it just kind of grew from there and that became our hub.
1140000	1143000	I remember that we had a birthday party for somebody there.
1144000	1149000	And I'm pretty sure it was that same girl you were referencing. But it was the Cheers bar of nerds.
1150000	1151000	And then we went to Brookfield's.
1151000	1159000	Yes. Anyway, I just had to acknowledge the whole Bamani being 20 years old here at the top of the show because obviously without it we wouldn't have OLR.
1160000	1162000	So I'm very excited to see what the future looks like.
1163000	1164000	I miss Rick.
1165000	1167000	Oh yeah, where is that? I fucking worship Rick. I remember that guy.
1168000	1169000	Yeah, he got married to Mary.
1170000	1171000	Worship Mary, yeah.
1172000	1173000	And then they vanished.
1174000	1176000	I hope they're okay. Rick, Mary, if you're out there we miss you.
1177000	1178000	Yeah.
1178000	1182000	It was a call. Anyway, what was I going to say? What was his cousin? Timmy?
1183000	1186000	Timmy, who was the son of the person.
1187000	1188000	He had a well-known family, yeah.
1189000	1192000	Whose friend tried to stalk me.
1193000	1194000	And I don't remember.
1195000	1199000	Yeah, his friend was sending me harassing messages. And so I IP traced him and got his address.
1200000	1204000	Because back then it was actually easier to do it. You know VPNs and all that were still new.
1204000	1214000	And so I sent him a NetSend. Not a NetSend. I messaged him somehow. Linked his address and IP.
1215000	1217000	I was like, you talk to me again and I'm going to report you to the police.
1218000	1219000	And Timmy apologized to me.
1220000	1223000	Well Timmy was a good young citizen.
1224000	1225000	That hung out with assholes.
1226000	1228000	Well, a lot of little boys hang out with assholes. Anyway.
1229000	1230000	Where was I?
1231000	1232000	I don't know, you're pointing at me or like shaking me.
1232000	1235000	I know, I was shaking my finger at you for some reason, I don't remember.
1236000	1239000	We were talking about, I wanted to get into another topic, but I guess, oh, I know what it was.
1240000	1243000	Because before the show. So our pal, Shane, is in Japan right now.
1244000	1245000	And he's been taking video of all these games.
1246000	1252000	And so speaking of like the future of Bomani, you were mentioning, did you see this one that has been around there?
1253000	1254000	And I know, I think he posted a video of this too.
1255000	1259000	Dance Rush is what it's called. So it kind of looks a little bit like DDR.
1259000	1262000	But imagine if you were playing DDR but stepping on a giant touchpad.
1263000	1266000	So there's not really necessarily arrows that you follow.
1267000	1274000	It's kind of like, a little bit like, I guess, when they tried to do the connect stuff with DDR.
1275000	1277000	Where you'd have to jump and move your arms in certain ways and stuff.
1278000	1282000	So basically, the entire stage has this pixelated look on it.
1283000	1285000	And everywhere you step, it just makes glitter and explosions everywhere.
1286000	1288000	Oh, I know what this is. It was originally called Step Star.
1289000	1290000	And so they have this like...
1291000	1292000	It's definitely an evolved version of it.
1293000	1294000	It's first beta was called Step Star.
1295000	1296000	Okay.
1297000	1298000	Because that sounds like Step Star. I'm going to look it up.
1299000	1302000	So then, so basically, yeah. So you have all this stuff and they integrate like slides in there.
1303000	1305000	So you have to like step with certain feet on certain things.
1306000	1310000	You have to kind of drag your feet along the ground to match where, you know, the highlights are.
1311000	1315000	And then there's spots where you have to jump and spots where you have to kind of like dip down a little bit.
1315000	1319000	Okay, here's the problem. When I started playing DDR, I was 22, 23.
1320000	1321000	By the time I get to one of these machines, I'm going to be 40.
1322000	1324000	So am I going to be able to do this? I don't think so.
1325000	1331000	I don't know. It's a little less, you know, fast paced it seemed like from the stuff I saw.
1332000	1334000	But what's kind of cool about it too is they also have like this like selfie.
1335000	1337000	It records video footage, which is kind of cool.
1338000	1344000	So you can actually watch yourself play and they add the like stupid like, you know, Instagram effects and shit on there.
1345000	1346000	So it looks cool.
1347000	1348000	All right. So here's are the names it's gone through.
1349000	1353000	It was first Stepstar in July, then Shuffle Dancers with a Z.
1354000	1355000	Shuffle?
1356000	1357000	Shuffle.
1358000	1359000	Oh, Shuffle.
1360000	1361000	Then Dance Generations in September.
1362000	1364000	And so now I guess it's supposed to be its final name.
1365000	1366000	I like Dance Rush. I like that better.
1367000	1368000	Stepstar is okay, but the other two I don't like.
1369000	1371000	It looks cool though. I would like to try it.
1371000	1378000	So anyway, so the future of Bomani is, you know, even though Konami has made some interesting life choices, you know,
1379000	1386000	as one of our favorite drag queens on television, Dark Sakura, likes to say choices when it comes to
1387000	1389000	The singing of Sassy Gay Friend. Look at your life. Look at your choices.
1390000	1396000	When it comes to Konami lately, we hope the Bomani series will stay strong and even stuff that isn't technically Bomani,
1396000	1403000	but I'm sure owes, you know, a lot to the music gaming community and music games becoming bigger, such as DJ Max.
1404000	1409000	I know he's had a presence at PSX this weekend and, you know, I think will come up later in the show.
1410000	1412000	We're going to be talking about that that is releasing in the US, which I think is a great thing.
1413000	1415000	So, you know, all the music games, it's going to be great.
1416000	1422000	So anyway, transitioning into, we're going to get into a little more current stuff like what's been going on this week.
1422000	1428000	However, you know, here at OLR, because we have been doing this show for over 15 years, we're a little bit of a family,
1429000	1433000	just us, you know, here in the room as well with, you know, you guys out there that listen to us every week.
1434000	1439000	So on that note, it's the holidays and sometimes during the holidays, you do nice things for your friends,
1440000	1446000	which I think Dark Sakura has done tonight. Do you want to set this up, Dark Sakura, with what you brought to the studio tonight?
1447000	1448000	Yeah, I brought presents.
1448000	1452000	So, you're early, but actually no, because I guess Hanukkah is this next week, right?
1453000	1454000	Yeah. Okay, so you're not that early.
1455000	1459000	Yeah, so Rob and I put together for Loki's present.
1460000	1466000	And then I helped. I incorporated every few of your suggestions and then went a little crazy.
1467000	1468000	So it's for you and Alan to share.
1469000	1471000	Okay, I'm excited. Well, Alan's not here, but he might be listening.
1472000	1473000	No, go ahead and open it.
1473000	1480000	Well, Loki, you open yours first because this is one we both went in on because Jamie, you know, what do you think Loki would like?
1481000	1486000	And we bounced some ideas back and forth and we kind of landed on an idea and was like, yes, they didn't have flamethrowers.
1487000	1490000	Yes. Yeah, they didn't have flamethrowers. So hopefully, so he's opening it now.
1491000	1496000	He's rifling through the, he's giggling at what he's pulling out and sure enough, domino rally racing.
1497000	1500000	That's right. We got him domino rally because we talked about it in our previous episode of the show.
1501000	1502000	That's hilarious.
1503000	1508000	Even though I think you said the new ones weren't as cool as the old ones, I was kind of like, you know what?
1509000	1513000	It's still something you can do with this kid. And even if they already have domino rally, now they have more domino rally.
1514000	1515000	They don't have domino rally. Oh, good.
1516000	1518000	If they didn't have that, I was going to get crossfire.
1519000	1520000	What are these? There's stuff at the bottom.
1521000	1522000	Oh, there's more. What's that? Oh, candy.
1523000	1524000	Candy. Yay. Candy is always a good thing.
1525000	1526000	I like candy.
1527000	1530000	Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Fifth Dream says Dark Sakura got me something cool.
1530000	1539000	Unfortunately, we can't get you a present, Fifth Dream. We don't have a way to get you a physical presence, but Dark Sakura, do you have any life advice for Fifth Dream?
1540000	1541000	Don't suck.
1542000	1544000	There you go. Some free advice, Fifth Dream.
1545000	1546000	All right. So there's one more here.
1547000	1548000	All right. Here's, here goes gift number two.
1549000	1550000	Legos.
1551000	1552000	Legos. Of course. Of course we got them Legos.
1553000	1554000	All right. Woo.
1555000	1556000	Of course we did. What kind of Legos? I don't even know what Legos.
1557000	1558000	So we got a brickhead Batman.
1558000	1560000	Oh, you have the ones that look like the vinyl pop dolls.
1561000	1562000	Yeah, like the pop dolls.
1563000	1564000	Y'all know I love pop dolls.
1565000	1567000	Flaco, you out there listening? You know I love me some pop dolls.
1568000	1574000	One of these giant, like, assorted Lego classic things with a bin to put stuff in.
1575000	1576000	Something that will not limit your imagination.
1577000	1578000	Awesome.
1579000	1580000	There we go.
1581000	1582000	We're going to have to put all that together and maybe Jamie can take a picture and put it on Twitter or something.
1583000	1584000	Sure.
1585000	1586000	All right. I'm going to open this.
1586000	1587000	This is some, I like this wrapping.
1588000	1589000	There's some little teeny things in there too.
1590000	1593000	Wait, is this an actual, oh, I thought this was wrapping.
1594000	1597000	Oh my God. It's a crinkle cat tunnel.
1598000	1603000	So as if Mr. Smoosh didn't love paper bags more than anything, now he's going to have this tunnel.
1604000	1607000	And you can undo it in the middle to be a long tunnel.
1608000	1609000	Oh boy. Oh boy. It's over now.
1610000	1614000	She's mentioned things for the cat and I was like, well, things for the cat are technically things for the daddies to watch the cat.
1614000	1620000	Is this? Oh my God. Is this one of those? Oh, oh, oh my God. I was telling JD about this. This is one of those. Yes.
1621000	1630000	Okay. JD, if you're out there listening, you know that pillow you have with the sequins where like, if you rub it down one side, it's one color and you rub it up the other, it's the other color.
1631000	1634000	So this one is, and hopefully some of you guys know what I'm talking about. This is a...
1635000	1636000	It's called a mermaid fin.
1637000	1639000	Purple and silver, but it's a mermaid fin, like a Snuggie.
1639000	1644000	I fucking love it. This is great.
1645000	1646000	Well, you'll have to share it, but...
1647000	1650000	And now I can like rub down my body and change my mermaid colors.
1651000	1653000	But yeah, the whole bottom fin is that reversible sequin.
1654000	1658000	I love it. No, ask JD. I sat there like all weekend, like rubbing the sequins on that pillow.
1659000	1660000	Now you can rub your own sequins.
1661000	1663000	Now I can rub my own sequins. There you go. I'm so happy. That's awesome.
1664000	1665000	Dang, Jamie, you went all out.
1666000	1667000	Well, it's for you and Alan.
1667000	1673000	Some lanyards. This is good because if you know me and Dragon Con, I always fucking forget lanyards.
1674000	1675000	So I won't do that next time.
1676000	1679000	One for each of you. You can fight over if you want modern Mario or old school Mario.
1680000	1681000	Well, obviously I'm taking old school Mario.
1682000	1683000	And then what's this? This is a...
1684000	1687000	For Mr. Smoosh. That was the thing. I almost told you what it was.
1688000	1691000	It's like, okay, it's a little skull and crossbones outfit.
1692000	1693000	I pulled the tag off of it because it got broken.
1694000	1695000	Okay, but that is...
1695000	1696000	I'm gonna murder you.
1697000	1698000	I have one like that for Midna, but it's her leash.
1699000	1700000	Jamie, there's too much here.
1701000	1702000	It's for you and Alan.
1703000	1704000	There's some candles.
1705000	1706000	They smell like amazingness.
1707000	1709000	And some candy. That's good.
1710000	1711000	And then what is this? A little...
1712000	1713000	I got two of those. One for you.
1714000	1717000	Unicorn keychains. And for those of you waiting for video game news, I promise we're getting there.
1718000	1720000	There's also a little teeny pin in there for you in particular.
1721000	1723000	Oh, shoot. Little tea lights. That's good.
1723000	1725000	And there's a pin in there if you can find the pin.
1726000	1728000	It's small, so I hope it didn't get lost.
1729000	1730000	Oh, yeah. I see it. It's way down here.
1731000	1733000	Oh, it's a little enlightened.
1734000	1736000	I got that for you to go to events, Etsy.
1737000	1738000	Oh, okay. Work.
1739000	1741000	So she actually found me an Ingress Enlightened pin. Thank you.
1742000	1745000	That's rad. I'm gonna put that on my hoodie that I just got.
1746000	1750000	Well, you know, I've been kind of broke the last few years and you guys have done nice stuff for me.
1751000	1752000	So I kind of went all out this year.
1753000	1756000	Thank you.
1757000	1760000	I'm feeling the love here at OLR. You guys are too much. Thank you guys so much.
1761000	1764000	Thank you guys. Marry whatever you celebrate here this December.
1765000	1766000	We call it Joomis at my house.
1767000	1770000	Or just, you know, happy holidays. I guess it's the good old catch all.
1771000	1776000	But you know what I mean. Merry Christmas, happy Hanukkah, whatever it is you're into this time of year.
1777000	1780000	Have a good one. And just, you know, thank you guys so much for being a part of OLR
1780000	1783000	and our continued, you know, growth over the last 15 years.
1784000	1787000	So, you know, we may not be the highest rated podcast out there.
1788000	1789000	But we have the most heart.
1790000	1795000	Or apparently we're not the highest rated podcast in Sacramento either based on something I was seeing on Twitter this weekend.
1796000	1797000	Is it about video games?
1798000	1799000	I'm not gonna be shady.
1800000	1801000	What?
1802000	1803000	If it's not about video games it doesn't count.
1804000	1805000	No, of course the show's about video games.
1806000	1807000	That meant the other podcasts.
1808000	1809000	Yes it is. I'll show you later.
1810000	1812000	I don't know who you're talking about. Did you see the same thing I saw?
1813000	1814000	No, but I suspect.
1815000	1816000	Oh, I see.
1817000	1818000	Just based on the people I follow. But hey, you know what, it's fine.
1819000	1820000	Yeah, it's fine.
1821000	1822000	They pimp themselves out more than we do.
1823000	1825000	As long as you're number one in your hearts. That's all we need.
1826000	1828000	Better number one in your heart than number one in the toilet.
1829000	1830000	Alright, let's move on.
1833000	1835000	Let's talk about the Game Awards this week.
1835000	1844000	That was, hey, you know what, I know we've given these award shows a lot of shit over the years, and rightfully so to be quite honest, especially the years they were on Spike TV.
1845000	1848000	But I gotta give credit where credit is due. Now, I didn't see the whole thing. Disclaimer.
1849000	1853000	I've been sick this week, so I kind of passed in and out and saw little bits and pieces.
1854000	1858000	But what I saw, I do have to admit, I was like, you know what, this really isn't turning out half bad.
1859000	1860000	Sure, there's things they could do better.
1860000	1869000	I don't like the whole, that they'll bring somebody up on stage and be like, they also won the award for best RPG and best, and kind of do that.
1870000	1874000	I think what they should do, I understand it's only like a three hour show or something like that, right?
1875000	1880000	If they need to cut corners for time, what they need to do, they need to do it kind of like the Grammys do.
1881000	1888000	You know, have your opening, do maybe an award in the beginning, and then be like, let's take a look at some of the other categories that were given out before the show tonight.
1888000	1894000	And then just do a quick montage for like three minutes, covering the categories you're not going to do on TV.
1895000	1898000	And then, you did it! Huzzah! Huzzah! You did it!
1899000	1903000	And that way if you do the pre-production of all that, you won't forget anything either. Huzzah!
1904000	1908000	That would be my suggestion. But honestly, it could be a lot worse. And it has been a lot worse.
1909000	1914000	But some things that they did right, like I did see at the end when they had the orchestra playing all the stuff from the games of the year.
1914000	1920000	And they actually had the gal, was she lip syncing the Pauline stuff? Or was she actually the voice of Pauline doing that live?
1921000	1922000	I don't know.
1923000	1926000	I don't know. If she was the voice of Pauline doing that live, that was really impressive. I think she was doing it live.
1927000	1930000	Or she's a good enough lip syncer to be on Drag Race, that's for sure.
1931000	1940000	So, I mean, I love that. I think we all like the video game orchestra stuff. It kind of brings more artsiness to our art form that we really enjoy.
1940000	1947000	So, you know, there's a lot of things that Game Awards are doing very well. So, you know, I don't want to always be negative here at OLR.
1948000	1952000	There are some, you know, good things amongst the, you know, challenges out there in the gaming industry.
1953000	1957000	But I think for the most part, they've come a long way. So anyway, big news came out of the Game Awards.
1958000	1965000	You know, Jeff Keeley, who puts this whole thing on, he's worked very hard to make this a, I don't want to say like a winner E3, but certainly like the must-see winner event.
1965000	1974000	And I would say, honestly, he took a lot of steam out of PSX, I think. A lot of these announcements could have been PSX, but they weren't.
1975000	1980000	So we'll get to PSX a little later though. But we had some announcements that came out of the Game Awards.
1981000	1985000	Dark Soccer, you have a couple news items about the big, big, big stuff at the Game Awards, right?
1986000	1991000	A couple, yeah. Number one is Bayonetta 3, which is like, I'm glad I own a Switch now.
1991000	1999000	Now look, this is a very overused term in the year 2017, but can I just say, YASS.
2000000	2007000	Work. To Bayonetta 3. I was so, like I actually woke up from my medication induced coma.
2008000	2010000	I mean it's, to YASS, for Bayonetta 3, and then it was actually…
2011000	2012000	It's good that it's coming out. Yes. Yes.
2012000	2018720	but I feel it much like how you know it's in development the same as Metroid
2018720	2023680	Prime 4 is in development it's kind of like yeah I mean it's it's good but it's
2023680	2027160	like I wish there was something more concrete you know like this is coming
2027160	2032000	out next year yeah I'm coming out 2019 it's like it's in development and it'll
2032000	2036440	be coming out someday like Kingdom Hearts 3 someday that's coming out I
2036440	2041560	mean I just I guess it's it's reassuring that at least it's coming out and it's
2041600	2045600	exclusive to Nintendo so that's kind of cool yeah well you know and when people
2045600	2048520	are thinking about do I get a switch or not and don't forget they also had the
2048520	2052920	announcement about Bayonetta so they did have a day for that Bayonetta 1 and 2
2052920	2057760	are coming out for switch in February so that's awesome I'm so happy that
2057760	2060840	Bayonetta 2 is getting a second life and a second chance on a console that more
2060840	2064200	people are buying because that's cool you know that was one of the best games
2064200	2069080	on the Wii U and I think a lot of people really really missed it so it really is
2069120	2074440	the best Christmas video game too if you think about the opening of the the game
2074440	2078160	but anyway so I'm very excited about Bayonetta can I quickly mention though I
2078160	2080320	know you have another thing to mention but I just want to quickly because I
2080320	2082640	know it's not what you're gonna talk about but when you talk about the whole
2082640	2087480	like announcement leading into years of hype and so forth this is a challenging
2087480	2091240	place that I'm kind of at I'm kind of at with Death Stranding okay so one of the
2091240	2094360	other things they brought to the Game Awards was the a new Death Stranding
2094360	2098760	trailer right where it's like okay Kojima's Empreg Fantasy what is it
2098760	2104360	oh so mysterious much Wow you know that whole thing but but with with Death
2104360	2107520	Stranding like I'm kind of hitting that point and I think I wrote a very sassy
2107520	2112440	tweet about this that some people wanted to fight me on and I said okay do you
2112440	2116040	know what other game had years and years of hype and we didn't see a single bit
2116040	2120040	of gameplay footage yeah it was called No Man's Sky just think about that for a
2120040	2125360	little bit now look and then well Kojima bla bla bla doesn't do bad games
2125360	2131320	look look look I get it I get it but my point is I'm just I I would just like a
2131320	2135720	little something it's been a few years so I just like to see maybe a little bit
2135720	2139020	of game a little hint about what the fuck this is they did some stuff the
2139020	2142080	same type of thing though with like some of the Metal Gear Solid games as well
2142080	2146760	and eventually I'm guessing probably by e3 we should have gameplay I would think
2146760	2148880	because that's what they kind of do with Metal Gear Solid remember Metal Gear
2148880	2155840	Solid he went all crazy with like oh hey I'm not really Kojima I'm Joe Kim
2155840	2160800	something or other and I'm the Swedish guy and I'm wearing a full face like
2160800	2165040	bandage thing and I have this game coming out called you know I remember
2165040	2169480	the healthy we're calling it fan of pain the fan of pain it's not Metal Gear even
2169480	2174200	though it's like that's Metal Gear and then like you know they eventually like
2174200	2178920	ah it's me Kojima and if they don't lose weird shit that drag on for like a few
2178920	2184560	years so this is kind of his mo already and and let's put it this way like this
2184560	2188520	new trailer I still I have fucking no idea what the fuck this thing is about
2188520	2194520	like it's just weird and creepy and I'm confused and what's this gonna play like
2194520	2199720	I have no idea okay yeah I'm gonna say with Death Stranding look I'm sure it'll
2199720	2205360	be fine you know Kojima is great if this is what PT has turned into then
2205360	2209320	fucking you know PT was fucking if you think about it kind of like Silent Hill
2209320	2213080	where you'd have everything kind of melt into whatever yeah it's sort of like
2213080	2216880	that with the tar stuff so look I look I'm not I'm not saying like I'm gonna
2216880	2221920	hate on it or I'm not gonna buy it all I'm saying is okay I'm a little done
2221920	2226360	with the hype machine next time let's let's see some gay but what is the game
2226360	2231400	though that's where I'm at what is the game though that's it if you swallowed a
2231400	2238440	baby and there's a baby inside in and the baby winked at me give me a thumbs
2238440	2242880	up I know some people that swallow babies on a pretty regular basis anyway
2242880	2250880	Oh Jamie you had some other news I was just watching the Capcom Cup winner yeah
2250880	2253960	but that that that baby though and there is kind of like you know the myth like
2253960	2258320	if you swallow a watermelon seeds gonna grow in your stomach well how bullshit
2258320	2262420	your stomach is acidic I know well anyway I know some people that are in
2262420	2267960	trouble DLC for the Legend of Zelda breath of the
2267960	2277880	wild the champions ballad DLC pack 2 is I believe out already and looking things
2277880	2282880	over on it the biggest thing about this is that link gets a motorbike called the
2283280	2292440	master cycle zero and it also will let you explore differently we haven't
2292440	2300520	downloaded it yet but what we will be master cycle 0 f 0 f 0 switch confirmed
2300520	2309080	girl I'm trying you're reaching for it I'm trying so but yeah news news all the
2309080	2312760	stuff maybe it'll be in development someday if they put out enough Pikmin
2312760	2317720	games yeah I want them to do like a DLC that's the rebuilding Hyrule where you
2317720	2322440	wander around with Zelda or you could wander around as Zelda well breath of
2322440	2326840	the wild as we all know one game of the year at this point at the Game Awards
2326840	2331920	which you know I it's it's hard to say it's not well deserved I was surprised I
2331920	2335960	thought audience see we get it yeah purse it's tough though because it's
2335960	2340640	like I can see here personally I would have picked Mario Odyssey but at the
2340640	2346420	same time it's like but like is breath of the wild a bad game at all in any way
2346420	2352320	whatsoever though no were any of those games not really so it's like I think
2352320	2356600	you would kind of have to be satisfied with any of the winners but there is I
2356600	2362360	will say this it is nice and it is a good thing to see Nintendo win it for a
2362360	2366920	change on a game developed for Wii U nonetheless there is something very much
2366920	2371120	like cheering for the underdog sort of thing that you do get a okay that's
2371120	2375160	that's a happy ending sort of thing out of that yeah I mean so I think the
2375160	2379080	other thing that's really good with this particular DLC is that it's about the
2379080	2382960	the four champions hmm so I think that'll be cool to learn more about them
2382960	2388240	yeah that'll be fun all right so anything else about the Game Awards you
2388240	2390400	guys want to say actually there's a couple other little announcements we
2390400	2393160	should probably mention they came out of Game Awards so caliber six is the
2393160	2396600	biggest one on my mind that they showed the trailer show too much of that well
2396600	2404560	they showed what it was Sofia and one of the other guys he's like the main guy
2404560	2407680	yeah I think they were fighting each other and that was that was kind of the
2407680	2410680	gist of it but they didn't yeah we don't know what like if there's character
2410680	2414960	customization again or who the guest characters are anything like that I like
2414960	2418720	well the announcements they had a lot of VR announcements which was kind of cool
2418720	2423560	so accounting is one that I'm looking forward to that's just really fucked up
2423560	2426760	it's done by the guys is Rick and Morty and they're actually doing in it as
2426760	2432920	another game as well but counting plus they've added more stuff to it and then
2432920	2438400	they announced the sequel to job simulator which is vacation simulator
2438400	2442840	which looks alright I'll definitely pick that up cuz I like the first one well
2442840	2445520	you just answered come on no Gus's question in chat are you gonna get
2445520	2451080	vacation simulator yeah I'll get it I'll get away comes out but those are
2451080	2457120	kind of neat and then they showed off a trailer for dream remember how like they
2457120	2460480	always have those like weird tech demos that media molecule was just hoeing off
2460480	2463720	yeah it's like finally get what they were trying to do with that it's like
2463720	2468880	fucking little big planet just amped up yeah a little bit a little big universe
2468880	2472280	yeah it's just ridiculous so I still don't know what the gameplay is gonna be
2472280	2475920	like but it looks like you can just well I'm not sure there is they'll
2475920	2479440	probably be some type of campaign adventure mode but maybe the sandbox is
2479440	2482880	the game kind of like a little big planet was kind of yeah yeah so I mean
2482880	2487840	I'm kind of interested you get to make your dream all the olr dream games come
2487840	2491100	true but I don't know if that games VR because they had some shots in there
2491100	2494720	that made it look like it could be VR but I don't know if it is I know it had
2494720	2500860	like move controller support but I don't know if it's like a VR game be cool to
2500860	2509020	see though maybe it can maybe it's optional hmm all right some breaking
2509020	2512700	news coming in our chat room oh shit sorry I dropped my phone some breaking
2512700	2515780	news coming in our chat room over at live dot vog network calm I guess Capcom
2515780	2519380	Cup is wrapping up and I think about an hour ago I should say this they did
2519380	2523340	announce that there is a Street Fighter collection coming out on PlayStation 4
2523340	2526580	so it is a Street Fighter 30th anniversary collection and it's
2526580	2531460	basically like every Street Fighter through like one two and three and every
2531460	2538140	like you know hyper two and all the other stuff and alpha is in there as
2538140	2541780	well so that's pretty rad so that's a real that sounds like it's gonna be a
2541780	2545740	really good collection they've only confirmed PlayStation because PSX is
2545740	2549140	going on right now I would hope they think about doing the switch but
2549140	2552700	considering they just put a $40 Street Fighter 2 remake on the switch maybe not
2552700	2557300	I don't know and then they are saying there in our chat over at live dot vog
2557300	2562220	network calm is Sakura was just confirmed for Street Fighter 5 sounds

2589220	2594700	that's exciting that's great those people have paid $40 for the I mean I
2594700	2598780	unless you really wanted that first-person fireball mode or and also
2598780	2602660	the extra characters that they created that were totally unique evil was it
2602660	2606940	evil right you and you know perturbed can or whatever it was I don't remember

2625780	2630500	there I don't think no I don't know probably just a new character I think
2630500	2633180	unfortunately I don't have the video in front of me so I'm relying on our
2633180	2636620	chatters to kind of fill me in on what's going on there but that's that's the
2636620	2641260	breaking news going on right now out of PSX we'll talk a little bit as well
2641260	2644500	about PSX we're gonna get into that in the news but first let's talk about our
2644500	2647940	gaming weeks the types of video games we've been playing this week Dark Sakura
2647940	2652860	how was your gaming week it was all right I've had a busy week so I have
2652860	2666340	been playing with I guess Pokemon go and Animal Crossing I'm almost level 42 and

2693760	2701880	play and then I played a little bit of ingress a little bit Pokemon go and a
2701880	2706800	little bit of the office space game although I kind of took a break from
2706800	2710080	the office space game for a little bit cuz it's just I was getting really
2710080	2714600	annoyed and just kind of the same stuff over and over again so I I don't know if
2714600	2718700	I'll go back to that or not I heard that endless Katamari game you used to play
2718700	2723540	and got me into for a little bit like finally came out for Android so I
2723540	2727660	thought I heard that amazing Katamari or something it's been out for Android I
2727660	2730500	had it for Android really I thought it I thought I was reading something just
2730500	2733300	today that like it just came out was there maybe a second Katamari game or
2733300	2737060	something oh is there a second Katamari game I mean at the big play that you
2737060	2740860	know tap my Katamari was oh wait no it's not tap my Katamari it was called

2869280	2874260	nostalgia orgy is what's going on here it isn't a soldier orgy okay
2874260	2878180	at least we've known you the book it's it's pretty good it's it's pretty dumb
2878180	2886180	but it's it's um it's fun Bobby Black Wolf and Chad says tracers not 80s well
2886180	2890940	not all the characters are 80s it you know a lot of the people had stuff
2890940	2897360	that's based off of 80s characters but you know not everybody necessarily had
2897360	2901780	avatars that were from the 80s it's just a lot of people were into that and so
2901780	2905420	that's what they made their avatars look like or they're more nostalgic about it
2906420	2910620	anything they've also said don't expect the movie to mirror the book it's gonna
2910620	2914420	be different having read the leaked script and based off the trailers it
2914420	2918300	seems to be following that it's not entirely based off of the book it's
2918300	2923900	falls the same kind of plot points but there are changes like some of the
2923900	2927060	different challenge or trials are different but I mean that makes sense
2927060	2931880	because like in the book the first trial was basically watching someone play a
2931920	2936960	joust game it's like that's not that exciting to watch on TV whereas an
2936960	2942080	extreme like racing thing with you know shit exploding and all these cars
2942080	2947520	everywhere that's more exciting right and I'm fine at that you know so it's
2947520	2951680	gonna be great I can't wait I'm already gonna put in my time off at work so I
2951680	2956240	can see that that's what a lot of people are doing this weekend for the war of
2956240	2963320	stars yes I'm right along with this big and then just because I don't want
2963320	2968280	spoilers and so I will see that I saw some fucking I saw like a Facebook ad
2968280	2972800	that was like basically like it was a it was an ad for the movie that was
2972800	2979560	basically like see it before it spoiled it's like fuck you like it was like an
2979560	2984000	official ad that was like see the movie before something asshole spoils it for
2984000	2987840	you I'm worried that someone will spoil it for me so thankfully they have shows
2987840	2992160	locally starting at 9 a.m. so somebody else I know on Facebook was like I'm
2992160	2996560	going to the 9 a.m. showing so the crowd won't it so that it won't be full I'm
2996560	3001240	gonna yell I'm gonna try to make it but like this is my day off to basically see
3001240	3006400	all the movies I've missed so I'm gonna see that for Ragnarok I'm not sure what
3006400	3010040	else is out that I want to see but I'm gonna see a couple movies and just to
3010040	3014240	catch up I want to see Lady Bird it's always I want to see how my city is
3014240	3018160	represented on the big screen because I imagine it's probably Lady Bird not
3018160	3021880	totally fly yeah oh yeah have you not heard of that that's like the movie that
3021880	3026120	is has all the Oscar hype around it you know because all the critics love it but
3026120	3029320	it was like made here in sack where our shows but Sacramento where we're based
3029320	3034000	it's like some of the landmarks you see it's like when you see the shot of the
3034000	3038280	Tower Bridge that's in the trailer I'm like oh I know exactly where that is
3038280	3041840	because I've played Pokemon go there a ton of times there I am in the back I
3041840	3044920	know as we're walking from Crocker to Old Town it's like we walk right by that
3044920	3048640	spot I'm like that's where all the homeless people hang out and it smells
3048640	3052680	kind of like urine all the time so I'm like that must have been interesting
3052680	3058440	when they made a movie there so just there was a thought I had when I saw the
3058440	3063120	trailer I was like romantic things don't usually happen in that spot actually but
3063120	3069840	such as movie magic I suppose I find your must so attractive that's not me
3069840	3074960	as Jonah Matt says Lady Bird is the apparently the highest rated movie most
3074960	3079040	certified fresh reviews on Rotten Tomatoes of all time I had heard that
3079040	3082640	too well then I have to not see it because I don't know what the hell it is
3082640	3088380	I think I don't know it might be is it about is it I think it's a girl coming
3088380	3091240	of age film so I don't know oh I thought it might have been about King of the
3091240	3094800	Hills you know I don't know wife wants to see it I bet your wife one it's
3094800	3098400	probably something your wife wants to see dark soccer have you heard of this
3098400	3104120	movie at all yeah yeah are you feeling it or no I kind of want to see it for
3104120	3107760	the Sacramento stuff and I do love Laurie Metcalfe I don't like going to
3107760	3112240	many movies it's it's not about Roseanne my childhood what not about Hank Hill's
3112240	3118320	dog it is not about Hank Hill's fucking dog all right anyway act F says it's a
3118320	3124160	slice-of-life movie there you go anyway that's about pizza sweet no all right
3124160	3129600	Mikey me week oh hi my video game week I well as you can hear I'm recovering from
3129600	3133680	a cold so I didn't play a lot of video games this week honestly I know it's
3133680	3136440	usually like oh if you're sick you just stay home and play video games all day
3136440	3139440	but no I really just wanted to stay home and sleep and then I didn't really have
3139440	3144080	the energy for video games but I did play an unhealthy amount of World of
3144080	3148240	Warcraft there was that I'm up to like on the character I started just a couple
3148240	3152840	weeks ago I'm up to level 97 now I think I just hit so there's that and
3152840	3159760	then let's see besides that I did play a couple new games on Nintendo switch the
3159760	3165240	one I'll mention is I started playing Xenoblade Chronicles 2 and even though
3165240	3167720	this isn't gonna make me the most popular person in the world I'm gonna
3167720	3172960	confess I can't I'm not getting into it like I started playing Xenoblade
3172960	3177640	Chronicles 2 and I just wasn't really grabbed by the story and the games don't
3177640	3180200	really have anything to do with each other right it's like Final Fantasy
3180200	3184240	right I because I didn't recognize any of the people in it I think I think
3184240	3188360	they're like separate stories but I tried playing through you know I was
3188360	3191720	doing some of the first few quests in the first area and I was like I'm not
3191720	3198120	I'm not feeling this I just I wasn't grabbed the same way that on Wii U
3198120	3201940	Xenoblade Chronicles X or whatever was on Wii U I just not grabbed the same way I
3201940	3207200	was with that game so that's my honest opinion I'll probably try to give it a
3207240	3211920	little more time and to be fair again I've been sick so I don't really have
3211920	3214880	the attention span for a lot right now so maybe I just didn't really give this
3214880	3219200	game a fair shot but yeah after playing it for and I've probably put a couple
3219200	3222440	hours into it I'm just I'm not really super feeling it like I'm not really
3222440	3228520	motivated to go play more so yeah dungeon buster in chat says XC2 has
3228520	3232560	nothing to do with the first one but it shares some concepts so okay so that's
3232560	3236280	that's a fair way to describe Final Fantasy games too I'm a dungeon buster
3236320	3241320	also says I like XC2 but it's not exactly blowing me away either okay well
3241320	3244960	I'm glad I'm not like totally being a negative Nancy with that then I just I
3244960	3249320	don't know it's just not grabbing me but maybe if if you're a super RPG fan maybe
3249320	3253760	there's gonna be here more here for you it is portable the text is really big
3253760	3256560	the interface looks a lot different so that like portable you can actually
3256560	3261000	reach it so you know that's all pretty cool but I just I'm not I haven't really
3261000	3266200	been grabbed by the game like I was with XCX so anyway so that was my gaming week
3266760	3271880	so some housekeeping real quick we will be here next week but then we will be
3271880	3274760	off for two Sundays we're not gonna be here Christmas Eve we're not gonna be
3274760	3278640	here New Year's Eve however I will be talking with the co-hosts about maybe we
3278640	3282360	can tape something at a different time so we're just not gonna be in our normal
3282360	3285640	live slot but I'm hoping we can still deliver something into the podcast feed
3285640	3289240	at least at least one of those weeks like a holiday special thing or
3289240	3292760	something we'll do while we're gone but unfortunately with the eaves falling on
3292760	3295920	Sundays this year it's gonna be really hard for us to be live especially like
3295920	3298760	an early show or something yeah maybe maybe especially I'll check in with you
3298760	3302080	guys for like New Year's New Year's plans like Christmas I can't even do an
3302080	3305120	early or Christmas Eve I can't even do an early show yeah but New Year's Eve
3305120	3308960	that's a possibility for sure so we'll I'll check your guys's schedule and so
3308960	3314120	forth so so that'll be that so those of you that come here live and listen on
3314120	3317400	Sunday nights we'll be here next week but then you're not gonna find us here
3317400	3320680	same bat time say bat channel for a couple weeks so I just want to warn you
3320680	3325680	guys now as Joe and Matt says will you do a special with your games of the year
3325680	3329960	probably that'll probably be do some something we do in that show I do time
3329960	3333640	capsule yeah and the time capsule maybe they'll be next year so yeah me well no
3333640	3337120	not next week well we'll save that and the so that way you guys have a reason
3337120	3341280	and motivation to go listen to the special show so we'll do that I'm
3341280	3344920	thinking an early taping will be good it's everybody fucking wants to know
3344920	3348320	about the time caps I can leave for go it's in there I mean I could here's the
3348320	3352720	miracle you could do I believe the shows in our archive you could go back to like
3352720	3356000	episode I think like 430 or something right now in our archive and then if you
3356000	3359680	want even further back just ask dark Tetsuya he has a little key to the vault
3359680	3363120	that has like episode 1 if you really want to hear it even though it's it's
3363120	3367160	it's hard for me to listen to episode 1 now it's pretty bad but anyway you know
3367160	3372460	you live you learn you grow but anyway we could just go back and listen to the
3372460	3375600	episode in June when we did it but that's the funny thing is that you know
3375600	3379800	with the gamer attention span we knew we weren't gonna remember that far back so
3379800	3382400	I don't remember what I said I know I don't remember what I said I have no
3382400	3385840	fucking idea what's in that thing just a little slips of paper it's probably just
3385840	3390320	gonna be like Jamie hand wrote things like give me a dollar and flaffle she
3390320	3399960	just wrote us do you like falafel anyway all right but we will I can already tell
3399960	3404840	you the time capsule will return in 2018 but it will be a proper time capsule so
3404840	3410480	that will be something we will do live on January 6th or 7th or whatever the
3410480	3417880	Sunday is the first show back so please look forward to it all right mmm as to
3417880	3422000	100 Matt says probably pictures of crudely drawn dicks and boobs probably
3422000	3426280	probably all right let's get into some gaming news it was actually a very busy
3426280	3429520	week because we had the game awards and we had other stuff right it's all this
3429520	3433400	like stuff that you just didn't even know that was there and all sudden yeah
3433440	3440840	so there was some announcements made at PSX which had its opening night just a
3440840	3447960	couple days ago so some cool additions one is which in knock I don't know how
3447960	3453400	vomit inducing this is gonna be but wipeout Omega collection is getting a VR
3453400	3460680	mode so that'll be intense I'm sure so look forward to that that sounds
3460680	3463920	completely unhealthy but I'm actually kind of into it I think wasn't that one
3463920	3470160	of the free games that they gave out with was wipeout omega free I bought it
3470160	3473640	I have the blu-ray so huh yeah I don't know if they gave I don't know if there
3473640	3477680	was a PlayStation Plus game or not but I feel like they gave away one of the
3477680	3482320	games that's remade in the collection they gave away a little maybe like on
3482320	3487100	PlayStation 3 but I don't think they gave away the collection yet okay well
3487100	3491180	noise God of War they're saying though that apparently the game is gonna be
3491180	3495940	quite long whereas the previous God of War games were bent about like 10 hours
3495940	3500780	long this one's gonna be 35 to 40 hours long which considering it's a linear
3500780	3507980	game that's that's a pretty long game so interesting they were saying that
3507980	3513620	talking a little bit about Detroit become human I guess you can ask about
3513780	3520380	they said emotional shocks so they were talking about how I guess why do I need
3520380	3525100	those from a video game when 2017 has been delivering to me in real life on a
3525100	3529180	regular basis I don't need any more emotional shocks thank you very much
3529180	3537140	yeah so there's I don't know it looks interesting talking about it you know
3537140	3540980	it's pretty much like the other other games that they've made MXC and chat
3540980	3544460	over at live.vognetwork.com about wipeout said surprisingly not that
3544460	3548540	vomit inducing and I'm not particularly great with VR but it's absolutely
3548540	3553320	intense okay how do you know that MXC were you at PSX this weekend or did they
3553320	3557660	do a demo on ps4 or something when I wasn't looking did he go do that they do
3557660	3560540	the live theater experience thing or something like that because I don't
3560540	3565360	know they have they didn't have like a keynote Oh MXC says oh yes I did go to
3565360	3570380	PSX oh that's great I hope you call in later I'd love to hear more many evils
3570420	3575540	getting remastered for PlayStation 4 so that's how that's pretty cool they're
3575540	3582340	gonna do a VR standalone experience for The Last Guardian which I guess they're
3582340	3586980	saying that's coming out as a demo um actually in a couple days to December
3586980	3593120	12th Monster Hunter world is gonna feature Megaman in there which looks
3593120	3601680	kind of weird but okay it's like a pixelated 3d 8-bit Megaman but not I
3601680	3605520	don't know they're saying that maybe in the future that you'll be able to change
3605520	3610480	your PlayStation Network name so that might be something that's coming soon
3610480	3614880	but this is really fucking hard for Sony to do isn't it
3614880	3619360	apparently I guess like you know it's like they're trying to invent the cure
3619360	3622940	for a disease over there to change your fucking name on PlayStation Network my
3622940	3627880	god yeah and that's pretty much it right now as far as like some of the
3627880	3632300	announcements that they have like during the first day so interesting yeah it
3632300	3635500	sounds like it sounds like the event this year was was a little different
3635500	3638540	from other years especially you know they didn't really have that bang-up
3638540	3641460	announcement thing that they did yeah there was kind of like we're just gonna
3641460	3645700	smoke pot and chill here on Friday night like I actually watched a little bit of
3645700	3651100	that and I was kind of like basically they were doing a podcast but on stage
3651140	3654940	with hundreds and hundreds of their friends I'm surprised well I'm not
3654940	3659580	surprised I'm disappointed I should say that they didn't have any announcements
3659580	3665300	regarding backwards compatibility oh and they set it up for that too like one of
3665300	3667900	the guys there was a Shawn Layden I'd actually kind of set up for that like
3667900	3672180	it's not like you can go into a store and go get a PSX or something like that
3672180	3676740	and the whole audience is like yes yes yes I'm gonna I'm gonna and then he's
3676740	3679500	like and that's why we're remastering medieval and you just hear the whole
3679500	3684620	like polite golf clapping in the audience like yay we get to buy it again
3684620	3692900	yeah it's I don't know I kind of disappointed I just wish that they would
3692900	3697620	do something about it I would have liked to gone to PSX I wish the year had been
3697620	3702540	kinder to me so I had more vacation time to do that but maybe maybe next year
3702540	3706940	just was in the cards for me this year but then next year I have to debate if
3706940	3711700	I'm gonna go to Final Fantasy fan fest or maybe even Blizzcon like so many
3711700	3720100	conventions so little time the struggle the struggle anyway I'm sorry I can't
3720100	3726220	stop watching the Sakura trailer oh how she look she looks really good but this
3726220	3730100	is what's a neat touch is that you know how normally when one of the characters
3730100	3734080	does something that you know they put their key into it's either charge blue
3734080	3738600	or something hers are all pink with cherry blossoms can I just point out
3738600	3742660	here in this moment we're talking positively about Street Fighter 5 here
3742660	3746600	at orange ons radio just note that down to the right time I fucking love her
3746600	3751060	outfit and I might have to do that outfit I haven't anything about Street
3751060	3756880	Fighter 5 maybe this is a great Diablo I have no I have no interest in Street
3756880	3763880	Fighter 5 oh my god in the background here is like her backyard with her
3763880	3767640	little brother playing video games again mm-hmm that's awesome that just
3767640	3771520	makes me super happy inside well this is gonna make a lot of people happy and
3771520	3774600	it's one of those things where I would say it's kind of obvious but it's nice
3774600	3779520	to have the confirmation especially when the developers were moving on to another
3779520	3785440	big game out of the Marvel Universe Square Enix did confirm that a new Tomb
3785440	3790680	Raider game is happening but they didn't say anything else it was not featured at
3790680	3794880	the Game Awards it was not featured at PlayStation experience little weird that
3794880	3797880	they kind of just announced this on Twitter with kind of like an open letter
3797880	3802640	but perhaps I'm gonna speculate maybe originally they were going to announce
3802640	3806840	it at one of these events something happened schedule got pushed back a bit
3806840	3811560	and so they decided now is not the time to do it but for whatever reason they
3811560	3814880	didn't announce it with a big trailer or anything but they did confirm we're
3814880	3819200	working on it so there will be a third Tomb Raider game by the way remember
3819200	3823040	that we saw the name shadow of the Tomb Raider I think trademarked or something
3823040	3827080	not that long ago so it's very possible that's the name but of course if they
3827080	3830960	want to change it who knows their statement said Square Enix is excited to
3830960	3834320	share some big news with you next year honestly we wish we could share it with
3834320	3839000	you right now but we're taking a new approach this time driven by our goal of
3839000	3842520	putting our fans first we want you to know that it won't be very long between
3842520	3848640	the official reveal and when you can play that's also a very interesting that
3848680	3853360	has me concerned because we did that we did see a trailer during the whole Game
3853360	3859280	Awards called shadows died twice so I don't think Loki you're reaching you
3859280	3863560	know you're reaching this is this isn't fucking Kojima Swedish developer Phantom
3863560	3867480	Payne shit okay it's not there's no reason for the Tomb Raider folks gonna
3867480	3874040	have twice as bad of a day no it's three times three times three times that
3874200	3881160	third times not the charm for Lara Croft as she gets eaten by a bear Lara Croft
3881160	3884840	in the no good horrible very bad day our journey together will begin with a major
3884840	3890080	event in 2018 we simply can't wait to take you on Lara Croft's defining
3890080	3894640	adventure that makes it sound a little final doesn't it I don't know it's just
3894640	3897360	hype well do you think maybe here's another thought do you think maybe
3897360	3901240	there's a tie-in for the movie do you think oh they're gonna hope not maybe
3901320	3905640	they're gonna show the trailer for the game with the movie and then the game is
3905640	3909400	gonna be out that fall that would be an interesting way to do it in my right in
3909400	3913760	the game I don't think they're rushing the game it's been what rise to the Tomb
3913760	3921280	Raider was like last year on no I think it was like two years ago I was two
3921280	3924760	years ago because they have the stupid time exclusive so if it's next year I
3924760	3928840	mean honestly they've had a good three years to do it now granted assuming
3928840	3934160	crystal we don't really have crystal dynamics that are they are is critical
3934160	3937480	dynamics doing this game because they might not be because they've got the
3937480	3942200	Marvel game they're working on right um yeah and so this Tomb Raider game may be
3942200	3947280	coming from elsewhere Tomb Raider was highly featured in the trailer today for
3947280	3953120	Ready Player One several times oh actually I'm I'm reading that Eidos
3953120	3958280	Montreal is apparently making this new game that's already that's the studio
3958280	3964680	that's hit man mmm I don't remember yeah one of them does that so be
3964680	3967600	interesting to me it could be a very different type of Tomb Raider game too
3967600	3973680	so anyway you mean she won't die horribly all these times she'll be
3973680	3979480	fluent in French and English all right anyway moving on Dark Sakura other
3979480	3984040	there's considering we're in fucking December is actually very busy gaming
3984040	3989400	Newsweek mobile games no exception right Jamie indeed a Niantic is bringing
3989400	3994540	out the third generation of a Pokemon and this time they're gonna be affected
3994540	4000200	by weather so it will I guess work in conjunction with local weather so that
4000200	4004680	you'll get certain Pokemon that are available like in the rain or the snow
4004680	4009440	or bright sunshine are we're gonna get a lot of fucking desert types or something
4009440	4015240	no it's fire grass and earth type it's already been brought in they launched on
4015240	4018840	Friday so yeah if you bring up your game you can actually see it right now I
4018840	4023560	don't know what the weather is I just caught a whirlpool on the house it was
4023560	4027440	some of the gentry stuffs here it was sunny I hadn't seen any of them today
4027440	4032760	but then again my my I had to get a new SIM card I just upgraded my phone I got
4032760	4037400	an iPhone 10 I have seen it switch from sunny to cloudy right now it's night oh
4037640	4042760	yeah there's that's the C dots evolution yeah Nuzleaf on the house right now so
4042760	4049040	yes everybody has their phone trying to catch the Nuzleaf he's an ugly little
4049040	4056240	fuck yeah but that's a lot of candy I think you need like a hundred to evolve
4056240	4062720	Nuzleaf into the third form there so I love it everybody brought up Pokemon go
4062720	4066320	here in studio and everybody's catching the fucking Nuzleaf on the house right
4066320	4070280	now it's so interesting that they did put the details of nipples on the
4070280	4073760	Nuzleaf as well yeah well it's like Mario necessary it's like Mario it's
4073760	4082360	Nipley anyway oh my god it's a wonder where if you appraise it it's the
4082360	4088080	highest appraisal oh that's awesome maybe that's just for you no oh if you
4088080	4093800	have to be at least level 30 to get the same I think Pokemon 29 don't yeah mine
4093800	4099240	appraised at the highest level 27 don't I'm a sit in a row but that was 37
4099240	4104200	anyway yeah JD points out that it makes certain types of moves more powerful
4104200	4109080	yeah and the raids it affects the raids so usually when you catch a Pokemon at a
4109080	4113760	raid I think you catch it at level 30 question mark but now you can catch it
4113760	4117720	up to like level 35 no I think you catch the Pokemon level 20 from a raid but the
4117720	4124360	weather bonuses add five levels so like you can catch ho ho is what I call him I
4124360	4128520	think he's ho oh but I call him a ho ho because well you know where that name
4128520	4133680	comes from no I don't it's a word for Phoenix okay well that makes sense
4133680	4137280	especially considering the design but it's Christmas so I call him ho ho so I
4137280	4141200	did catch a ho ho but apparently people are catching hoes that like the CP is
4141200	4144560	through the roof because they're five levels higher during the right kind of
4144560	4152160	weather so I III is impressive at least e3 vl or evil in our chat room over at
4152160	4156200	live dog network comm says I quit because of that I could take out gyms on
4156200	4161320	my own and not raid battles no discord around me have to travel 15 miles not
4161320	4165940	worth it in my opinion yeah that's a bummer the the more rural folks have a
4165940	4170280	real problem trying to do like you know trying to get right now absol from gen
4170280	4175080	3 is like a four star raid evils not gonna be able to do that himself unless
4175080	4179160	he can get a party of like seven people and that's led to people wanting to
4179160	4182520	multi-account and do all that stuff so they you know so they can enjoy the the
4182520	4187680	whole game and that's kind of Nantic needs to think about maybe flexing how
4187680	4192880	strong like at least make it so you can capture a week week week one by yourself
4192880	4196080	and then maybe have to just go through the process of leveling it up or
4196080	4200880	something I wish Niantic would revisit that somehow so yeah I wish we could
4200880	4206560	grind up one Pokemon for candy for another Pokemon wouldn't that be nice it
4206560	4209880	would be or at least like reduce did you want to mention the other piece on the
4209880	4215840	weather to Jimmy well yeah um well I did mention that the weather affects what
4215840	4220200	you can catch and how it catches right and that it you know like you brought up
4220200	4225000	it will bring up different advantages but you know the thing that actually
4225000	4227520	kind of strikes me worried about this is what if you live somewhere it doesn't
4227520	4231280	snow and you can't get like whatever is only going to come out only in that
4231280	4236880	weather my understanding is you there are not gonna be Pokemon that is limited
4236880	4241840	to weather so like there's nothing that will only spawn in snow but you're only
4241840	4246560	gonna be able to get stronger higher levels in snow it's kind of you'll have
4246560	4252280	to yeah so I mean you do get those penalties but it sounds like not living
4252280	4255840	in a snowy area is not gonna be the end of the world looking at the map to the
4255840	4259440	map will reflect the weather around you but they're saying though that one of
4259440	4262880	the disadvantages though of this new system is that if they think that
4262880	4266960	there's you know extreme weather outside they will actually reduce the amount of
4266960	4270100	spawns that are have like you know there's a screenshot I saw where
4270100	4274040	someone had one for snow he says extreme weather and you'll be careful going
4274040	4278720	outside and it's like there's a couple inches on the ground and that's it well
4278720	4282640	it sounds like those extreme weather alerts and Pokemon go are probably
4282640	4288640	triggered by actual you know warnings from the National Weather Service and
4288640	4291200	sometimes they put out warnings that aren't that serious not to sound
4291200	4295120	insensitive a man those fire types in LA are gonna be really strong that sounds a
4295120	4300240	little insensitive okay but well well but they're they're getting hit with the
4300240	4304360	extreme weather thing too in LA even if you're nowhere near those fires you know
4304360	4307560	you're getting hit with that right now but my understanding is it doesn't super
4307600	4311480	affect the spawn rate that bad but you're not gonna get any weather bonuses
4311480	4315600	in extreme conditions I think it feels like this might be a response in some
4315600	4319000	ways to remember when people were like playing Pokemon go in the hurricanes or
4319000	4322520	at least joking about it like you know if there's a motherfucking hurricane
4322520	4328080	coming to town put Pokemon go down I just number one I'm gonna go ahead and
4328080	4332020	spell this out for people who've never been in a fucking hurricane it sucks no
4332140	4339140	a cat one isn't that bad it's just a blustery windstorm with some rain we've
4339140	4343420	we've had storms here that were like a cat one we really right so it's not a
4343420	4347780	fucking big deal yeah if you live on the outskirts and you get the cat one level
4347780	4352420	winds that's not a big deal okay I've been in a hurricane that did nothing but
4352420	4357140	dump water on us for three days cycling out the bay and I walked to the fucking
4357140	4361620	circle K every night because we didn't have electricity right not that bad but
4361620	4366220	when you are getting cat three and higher that's when people need to stop
4366220	4369740	being stupid although I do know people who surf in hurricanes yeah and like
4369740	4373620	those poor folks in Puerto Rico and the cat five they got no fucking joke no
4373620	4378540	that's no joke at all but I think that you know if it's when the storm is
4378540	4382700	approaching I'm really not that concerned about it if you have your plan
4382700	4387140	in place to get out of you've got your generator but you know you get to cat
4387140	4391820	three level and higher that's when you GTFO or buck buckle down and have a
4391820	4396980	generator and don't do anything freaking stupid PS Pokemon will spawn in your
4396980	4403500	house hopefully unless you live in a really rural area like does evil do
4403500	4409580	Pokemon spawn in your house because it might not so anyway pardon me
4409580	4414300	anyhow let's move on so that's Pokemon go but the news keeps coming this week
4414300	4418740	right yeah exactly so they were talking during the whole Mega Man 30th
4418740	4422740	anniversary thing they were talking about all sorts of announcements one of
4422740	4427260	which is that on all eight Mega Man X games are we coming to current gen
4427260	4432740	platforms so PlayStation 4 Xbox one PC and even the switch in the summer of
4432740	4437340	2018 along with that because the switch did not receive the Mega Man legacy
4437340	4441820	collections they'll be getting legacy collections one and two which include
4441820	4446780	Mega Man 1 through 10 and I'll be coming during 2018 as well one of the
4446780	4450860	surprise announcements well maybe not surprised if you did end up playing what
4450860	4455100	some of those legacy collections and saw the leaked artwork that was in there but
4455100	4460580	Mega Man 11 was announced and make me 11 looks pretty amazing it actually the art
4460580	4465420	style of it reminds me a lot of mighty number 9 it's like taking all and you
4465420	4468940	know what people really wanted they wanted a modern Mega Man done like an
4468940	4475340	old Mega Man game with nicer graphics boom there it is and so I'm just kind of
4475340	4480100	I'm kind of been surprised so here's the first question that came to mind when I
4480100	4484620	saw that and I got to admit like I saw that I was like yeah yes yeah it was
4484620	4490220	yes right another week of yes I was looking to that and very very into it and
4490220	4493020	I think yeah this is the Mega Man game that people have been asking for is like
4493020	4497860	just make a really fucking good 2d Mega Man that's all we want right here's my
4497860	4505140	question though do we have mighty number 9 to thank for Mega Man 11 maybe
4505140	4509860	what do you guys think in our chat over at live dot vog network calm do we have
4509860	4514540	mighty number 9 to thank for Mega Man 11 and what I mean by that is you can take
4514540	4519140	that a variety of ways because maybe the success of the Kickstarter and that
4519140	4523040	people really wanted it or you could look at maybe the negative side of it
4523040	4526860	where and then when it came out it got a really lukewarm reception and people
4526860	4530660	weren't that into it so maybe Capcom kind of felt they had to come in and say
4530660	4536180	all right all right y'all let me show you how it's done even though by Ron I
4536180	4539900	mean you know Fune made Mega Man Mega Man and then Mike but anyway also made
4539900	4545860	money yeah but that whole complication aside you know going to our chat over at
4545860	4551380	live dot vog network calm act F says I think it did Mega Man 11 looks a lot
4551380	4555660	like mighty number 9 dungeon buster says I think Capcom may have been waiting in
4555660	4559940	the anniversary this month was the perfect moment dr. Sia says a fair point
4559940	4563620	I mean he went and made it since Capcom apparently couldn't be bothered and now
4563620	4568500	Capcom saw that people were actually interested JD says impossible to say
4568500	4574100	without inside Capcom information s 200 Matt says Mega Man 11 kicked mighty
4574100	4579140	number 9 when it was already down so it looked really good and they shut off one
4579140	4581900	of the powers which I'm not sure what that would have been but he dropped
4581900	4587060	blocks basically almost looks like then didn't come out that like they had
4587060	4592860	actually dropped a hint in the second Mega Man collection yeah it was like a
4592860	4596740	character that they show yeah there was artwork in Mega Man 8 or something and
4596740	4600340	everybody looked at it going that's not in Mega Man what is that and I think
4600340	4604220	most people wrote it off as oh maybe it was like a concept that didn't see the
4604220	4608460	light of day like they didn't actually go through with this particular thing
4608460	4611820	and then come to find out oh they just they they punked you they teased you
4611820	4615380	with a Mega Man 11 monster several months ago when that game came out so
4615380	4619980	that's that's kind of neat but yeah it looks really good so I'm very excited
4619980	4623420	to play it whenever it comes up and I think that's supposed to be I want to
4623420	4628740	say next year late next year yeah so they teased it with a lot of time to go
4628740	4632860	so maybe they only had that one stage done who knows but we still got a year
4632860	4637260	to go on this that's fine it looks good so far yeah I think people are gonna be
4637300	4641780	happy that Mega Man like it's happening don't fuck it up yeah because my number
4641780	4648980	nine good luck and don't fuck it up yeah and something else too they also
4648980	4652020	announced another collection right looking no we were talking about that oh
4652020	4655700	did we I must have missed that sorry yeah the Mega Man Mega Man X games those
4655700	4662100	are gonna be coming out and summer of next year but this time with Nintendo
4662100	4666980	switch yep yay and I also should mention that Mega Man 11 will be out on the
4666980	4671380	switch PlayStation 4 and Xbox one and the PC as well and then the other
4671380	4674740	Mega Man legacy collections they said they will put those out on switch if I'm
4674740	4679820	not mistaken yes PC as well I don't remember the second one was I think the
4679820	4684940	first one was I know I bought the I think about one of them or both of them
4684940	4693020	on PlayStation 4 yeah to register participation for this week's episode of
4693020	4698900	orange lounge radio at vog network comm use the passphrase warm anyhow you know
4698900	4702260	something that's been in the news a lot lately is Bitcoin which is something I'm
4702260	4706620	and I'm not trying to be a hater I just don't think I understand a Bitcoin and I
4706620	4711260	remember I remember a couple years ago when dogecoin was the thing somebody
4711260	4714580	kind of taught me how to set that up and do the mining on my computer but I have
4714580	4717460	to admit I still don't know to this day what the fuck I was doing I'm pretty
4717460	4721460	sure I have some Bitcoin still in my wallet well you should look into that
4721460	4724580	because do you have you heard about how much that value has gone up that it's
4724580	4729980	appreciated like by a lot I think I had like 25 Bitcoin at the time uh girl like
4729980	4733860	one Bitcoin is worth like $10,000 right now fuck me I'm gonna check that when I
4733860	4737340	need to look into your voice if you've got if you're like ho-hum I just have
4737340	4741100	25 bitcoins sit around right now bitch you've got like a fucking like house
4741100	4744700	fund right there if you can figure out a place to unload that Bitcoin well I mean
4744700	4749780	if I if I still had them because I bought I got Bitcoin like a while back
4749780	4753140	you might be thinking you have 25 Bitcoin but it turns out you have point
4753140	4757340	zero zero two five Bitcoin or something is that that is something that happens
4757340	4762060	too so well it's just like I got it like five years ago just because I was gonna
4762060	4767240	try using Bitcoin and then I never did anything with it okay so I I think it
4767240	4771420	would be very wise of you like tonight after you leave this show you need to
4771420	4774900	fucking figure out how much Bitcoin you have and keep in mind when I say this
4774900	4779620	right now in this story that I'm looking at at in gadget one Bitcoin is
4779620	4783660	worth thirteen thousand three hundred dollars as of this writing so if you're
4783660	4788460	like ho ho ho I have 25 Bitcoin just sitting around who knows where you
4788460	4793300	better fucking find it well I'll have to I mean I've got all the code written
4793300	4796700	down for my wallet so but just don't be disappointed if you go in there and it
4796700	4801540	turns out oh I had point zero zero zero two five but still yeah it's still you
4801540	4807220	might have like 20 bucks in Bitcoin sitting there so yeah you know anyway
4807220	4810780	let's see so anyway my point was one place you're not gonna be able to spend
4810780	4815100	that Bitcoin is on steam valve has stopped accepting Bitcoin right now
4815100	4818960	because of a combination of the transaction costs basically in the
4818960	4822660	beginning it used to be 20 cents now it's like $20 for each transaction and
4822660	4826580	because of the high extreme you know the volatility of what this cryptocurrency
4826580	4831380	is going through which I still fail to understand again I'm not hating I just
4831380	4836660	don't understand what is the where does the worth on a Bitcoin come from because
4836660	4840940	isn't my understanding that a Bitcoin is basically like a crypto passage that
4840940	4845900	does nothing it's just digital currency it doesn't make sense I just I don't
4845900	4849700	get it but I mean again I'm not hating I just I don't understand look at it this
4849700	4856340	way it would be like if you if say that well or like okay I'll use origin for an
4856340	4861140	example origin has points right and the points you pay a certain dollar amount
4861140	4864740	to get a certain amount of points okay if the points were being used though as
4864740	4869180	a currency they would appreciate and depreciate the way that normal currency
4869180	4876780	does so in that light it is a okay so that's actually not a bad paper is
4876780	4880260	paperless money that's not a bad way to explain it actually I actually kind of
4880260	4883980	get it because you're right if more places took those origin points then
4883980	4887540	they might go up or down based on you know how many people are on origin with
4887540	4891580	how many points are out there okay I guess some communities do like community
4891580	4896140	dollars where you know say that you go out and do like some public service and
4896140	4900540	you earn community money and it's useful in that community you can redeem it for
4900540	4906820	services or or a small good here and it has a value attributed to it it really
4906820	4912300	is just honestly I honestly would think that it would be great if all currency
4912300	4917780	went digital because first of all the the money that we have actually costs
4917780	4924600	more to manufacture it than the individual amounts worth and so if
4924600	4929220	everyone went digital and a lot of places now a lot of countries will have
4929220	4936220	like those NFR readers just about like as far as I'm more like I'll use as an
4936220	4939780	example because I was just reading about it vending machines in Japan almost all
4939780	4945500	of them will use NFR readers you know my Apple watch I don't have to have my
4945500	4949260	card anymore I bought my wrist on whatever the terminal and I can pay for
4949260	4955380	my money if all of our currency went digital like Bitcoin first of all that
4955380	4962620	would probably contribute to an increase in commerce and lowering you know
4962620	4966460	whatever national deficit that goes into the manufacturer of money yeah and I
4966460	4972140	actually Jamie I kind of get it because like you you can forge a $5 bill
4972140	4975940	probably pretty easy you can make a forgery of a $5 bill most people don't
4975940	4979020	check $5 bills they check 20s they don't really check fives yeah so you can
4979020	4981820	probably forge a bunch of $5 bills and you would have essentially fake money
4981820	4986580	out there now real money has some type of special they actually a little bit of
4986580	4988900	gold in there they have some say you have something in it that gives it a
4988900	4994980	little value right well no the 20s do the metal strips are just basically like
4994980	5002260	for authentication right and the they'll have like micro lettering and
5002260	5006940	all kinds of you know lenticular tricks and everything I mean some of the money
5006940	5011540	in other countries is like fucking holographic but you can't fucking forge
5011540	5016820	a Bitcoin no bitcoins every Bitcoin will have a digital signature on it and on
5016820	5021540	top of that too when you sign up for your wallet you are given because I like
5021540	5025100	I said I got my wallet about five years ago you're you don't have a password
5025100	5031340	you're given as an arbitrary series of like 12 words yeah that are your past
5031340	5035660	into your locker you lose that you have lost which in your locker which you
5035660	5039220	better not have lost your fucking locker I know where it is okay good girl you
5039220	5043060	know I kept that safe all I'm gonna remember is that just remember your
5043060	5048740	friend Rob Roberts when you're fucking filthy goddamn rich all this big we'll
5048740	5053460	see I already cashed him on my work stock all right that was really good
5053460	5057780	going to our chat come on Noel gust and chat says I can't slide digital currency
5057780	5063860	in a go-go boys G though well you could right if you had the actual key key
5063860	5068020	chain you know that's why they have like QR codes on coins right that's Bitcoin
5068020	5074020	but you know they also do make those little NFR readers for pay for payments
5074140	5079260	not like not like the square because the square is a slider but they have like
5079260	5082700	the little ones like the square you tap it on you can have that hooked up to a G
5082700	5087980	just tap your wrist on it like take my Apple pay so you could actually tap that
5087980	5093880	ass you could tap that ass you like that come on no Gus what would you rather do
5093880	5097460	do you want to slide digital currency in the go-go boys G or do you want to tap
5097460	5104520	that ass or you know I bet that they would do like like voucher conversions
5104520	5111660	for stuff like that you know they have a Bitcoin ATM at the mall that I've seen
5111660	5115660	yeah I look at them like I feel so I don't get what would I use that for like
5115660	5120100	I always feel so old like I'm a god this is this is what my parents must have
5120100	5123300	went through like when I was talking about Nintendo and stuff like I don't
5123300	5129060	understand anyway let's see SSG 100 Matt says she'll remember you talking
5129060	5132300	about Jamie she'll remember you Rob when she puts you in charge of her personal
5132300	5136580	pinkberry franchise location Oh goody you know I haven't had pinkberry in like
5136580	5139340	a year and a half I haven't had in a long time either because my husband
5139340	5144220	prefers yogurt land and sometimes you give up the things you like for your
5145220	5150620	pecan pie flavored right now we're going we're gonna pinkberry well we'll be done
5150620	5154580	we won't be doing the show in time all right probably not tonight next Saturday
5154580	5159740	we're gonna be very uh actually we have company from out of town here who might
5159740	5162820	be into that so we'll see oh well they're coming to then all right even if
5162820	5167340	they're not they're coming all right sounds good okay uh let's see and by the
5167340	5171820	way just also since the story was about steam and Bitcoin I did just want to
5171820	5176460	point out valve is not ruling out a return to Bitcoin in the future but not
5176460	5182060	until the volatility of Bitcoin settles down by the way as some of you nerds
5182060	5185660	probably know there's not just Bitcoin out there there's other digital
5185660	5190380	currency right like aetherium is another one I remember dogecoin is that worth
5190380	5193980	anything now because I might have dogecoin um and then what's the other
5193980	5197580	one that my friend was telling me this that he bought this litecoin is another
5197580	5203020	one so aetherium is another one now yeah which I just said I'm sorry I'm
5203020	5209660	checking we're tied now and the dogecoin price for today is 0.00 to $5 oh so it's
5209660	5213220	a quarter of a penny I think I don't even think I have like one dogecoin so
5213220	5220260	that's great I'm glad I did all that mining for dogecoin all right let's move
5220260	5226580	on with some more news dark Sakura well we like portal we like portal a lot and
5226580	5234460	portal is going to be in a collaboration for bridge constructor so
5234460	5239380	clockstone software and valve are putting it together to build bridges
5239380	5247980	with portals and so it looks interesting but it looks very silly and it has like
5247980	5254340	the little people figures like they have in the the portal ads you know like the
5254340	5257500	this is how you get from point A to point B and there's turrets and
5257500	5261220	everything it's adorable there's a door a bubble but you have to get the
5261220	5265380	aperture truck across the bridge and what do you build this out of aetherium
5265380	5271300	portals oh you can run over turrets with your truck that's amazing is this
5271300	5274660	something you might check out cuz it's my it's half portal which is something
5274660	5281140	you're like super into I know oh it's glad us this is so cute I just want a
5281140	5285220	new portal you just want a new portal game you want portal three Oh portal
5285220	5289500	three doesn't know how to count bitcoins are gonna fucking take for valve to give
5289500	5293540	us portals but anything anything with a three in it pretty much at this point do
5293540	5297240	I really mean anything is there any valve franchise doesn't believe in
5297240	5304140	threesomes Rob so apparently apparently which is lame all right I agree just a
5304140	5308220	few more stories before we get to the classic system of the month you guys
5308220	5312460	it's the last classic system it's December 2017 we're gonna get to that
5312460	5318740	in just a couple more stories it is Loki all right so this is odd but apparently
5318740	5327140	Nintendo is teaming up with Nvidia to release Wii games on the Nvidia shield
5327140	5332300	in China though so they're gonna have a number of older Nintendo games like New
5332300	5336540	Super Mario Brothers Super Mario Galaxy and Twilight Princess made for the
5336540	5344620	Nvidia shield that's interesting and I don't know how that's gonna work but I
5344620	5350580	mean does the shield have like wireless does it have like motion controls or
5350580	5353380	something I mean how the hell does that work if they have a like Wii remote for
5353380	5358980	that I mean I guess it's Bluetooth so you could well a lot of the games I was
5358980	5363340	noticing two things like New Super Mario Brothers Wii and stuff you know those
5363340	5367460	aren't games that really require motion control either true I guess it makes
5367460	5374060	sense but Mario Galaxy does though no I guess that's true yeah it does so maybe
5374060	5377260	something with the touchscreen on those things because maybe you can tap the
5377260	5383300	touchscreen I bet I bet it would work something yeah hmm I'm wondering though
5383300	5387740	because I want to this is that run on Android I mean I can't see how this
5387740	5391340	isn't gonna leak out that's that's my question too that was the first use I
5391340	5396900	okay it's coming out in China and you know China has a lot of people but not a
5396900	5400740	lot of the same games that we have here so I'm sure these companies are seeing
5400740	5404620	this as Oh potential huge market expansion with things that are not gonna
5404620	5408860	cost us anything especially Wii games those games for the most part they're
5408860	5412220	done here in the u.s. like you're never gonna sell Wii games and really make
5412220	5417660	money off them unless maybe virtual console but that whole question mark
5418180	5424580	games on the switch not yet because the switch is technically it's basically an
5424580	5430620	Nvidia shield so yeah so I don't know I would think that who knows that should
5430620	5433900	be very doable that was my thought is that the Nvidia shield is kind of a PC
5433900	5436820	based thing right so what's to prevent these games from leaking out over here
5436820	5442140	Tegra basic game system just like the switch okay but but at the end of the
5442140	5446460	day then you know maybe Nintendo's going it doesn't matter if the Wii games leak
5446460	5450060	out in the u.s. we've we've done made our money off those games already this
5450060	5457940	is just more money this is money for nothing it's Bitcoin I mean it's a good
5457940	5461900	idea because they've never had really consoles in China so that's you know
5461900	5466900	these this is gonna be a new thing for the people live there but is it really I
5466900	5474700	mean worth the check out there hey Alan Alan just got home Alan come here come
5474820	5478380	here I'm gonna totally derail the show but I have to show this so Jamie got us
5478380	5484580	holiday presents this is an outfit for mr. smoosh and look at this this is a
5484580	5488140	crinkle cat tunnel and you know he's gonna love the shit out of this
5488140	5494340	fantastic I love it there you go but did you show them oh yeah and then this is
5494340	5500100	for us it's a mermaid tail with the sequins that change colors that is also
5500100	5505180	incredible does this girl know us or what and I got you unicorn heads yes
5505180	5507540	and there's there's more seven here peek around in here's there's candles and
5507540	5511920	things here and candy so there you go but unfortunately chat room there's no
5511920	5516380	etherium in the bag but there's always 20 in the theorem is made of the ether
5516380	5521220	all right I got one more story for you guys then we'll get to the classic stuff
5521220	5525220	this one is about Facebook yes that's right I'm gonna do a story about
5525220	5529660	Facebook who remembers that Facebook actually has games built into messenger
5529660	5534260	because I mean there's things I blocked oh god my wife tried to play those I'm
5534260	5537220	not even talking about like fucking Farmville and that shit I'm talking
5537220	5541460	about like you can actually do in a messenger like what I could do nope you
5541460	5544460	better not message so here's something to do I'm gonna open up messenger right
5544460	5550020	now so I'm gonna go into messenger live here on air and I'm gonna start a new
5550020	5555380	conversation with Jamie and I'm gonna hit the ball there and then I'm gonna
5555380	5561540	hit this little button what is it I hit the plus sign and there's games and all
5561540	5566460	these games come up okay played recently pac-man play and then it's actually
5566460	5570460	loading pac-man onto my phone and then Jamie's gonna get a message that I'm
5570460	5574540	forcing her to play pack but yes challenge Jamie play now so there you go
5574540	5579140	and now it's loading and I can actually play pac-man so that's that's that's
5579140	5584460	actually all built into messenger so in my ringer is off anyway so you're not
5584460	5588020	gonna be able to hear any hear anything but basically once I were to get a score
5588020	5591100	in this I think you would see it and then you can like try to challenge my
5591100	5597740	score and beat it or whatever well because I turned the game off because I'm
5597740	5601140	trying to do a radio show but anyway there's other games in this messenger
5601140	5605140	thing too I it's something called ever wing I don't even know what half these
5605140	5608660	games are but there's you know little Facebook games but my point is
5608660	5613140	apparently something that Facebook is gonna be doing to celebrate one year of
5613140	5618220	games on messenger is to actually you can tap a camera icon in the upper
5618220	5623740	right-hand corner of the game screen and stream on Facebook live so I could
5623740	5628540	actually stream myself going this is me kicking Jamie's ass at pac-man live on
5628540	5634540	Facebook because Facebook desperately wants a piece of that twitch profit and
5634540	5638780	mixer and all that stuff Facebook really badly wants to be a contender in this I
5638780	5642420	personally think Facebook should stay the hell out of it not just because
5642420	5646860	they're Facebook but because I think the audience on like all the people on
5646860	5650580	my Facebook don't really want to see me playing video games like the audience
5650580	5654340	that's on my twitch is a very specific curated network that wants to be there I
5654340	5660540	think Facebook should stick to maybe life streaming and you suck my
5660540	5667180	battleship and so forth so anyway so you can stream that on Facebook live and it
5667180	5671860	is available I guess starting today but then later in 2018 you can play games
5671900	5676740	with friends from within a video chat in real time so you can see people's
5676740	5680620	reactions so one of the first games that's gonna get this is words with
5680620	5685780	friends so Jamie can actually see my reaction when she or maybe when it gets
5685780	5688940	battleship she can actually see my reaction live when she sinks my
5688940	5696460	battleship there's a game on here called mr. ah fuck these games are so stupid or
5696460	5701100	non cat when we're playing words with friends Jamie can see my reaction I get
5701100	5704660	really angry going what do you mean cunt isn't an acceptable word best to
5704660	5713020	move is on here all right let's let's go to classic times when you know what we
5713020	5719140	didn't we didn't have these messenger systems in our pockets we had beepers
5719140	5724900	actually I never had a beeper because that's my mom said Rob only drug drug
5725180	5731620	only drug dealers have beepers Rob if you have a beeper you're a drug dealer
5731620	5740140	dad has a beeper dad needs a beeper for work no my dad works for the railroad
5740140	5747700	don't leave one of my dad all right it's the classic game of the week but once a
5747700	5753740	month dark Sakura puts Facebook down and she steps in the game she says hey
5753780	5758060	here's a classic system for you to enjoy why celebrate the game when you can
5758060	5762140	celebrate the whole damn system she's been doing this every month at 2017 and
5762140	5766860	guess what guys tonight is the last one it is the segment gets retired after
5766860	5772060	tonight end of our classic system of the month so I picked a stinker so here it
5772060	5778100	is what is the classic system of the month the fairchild channel F lip lip
5778100	5783720	lip lip wow that riveting soundtrack the fairchild channel F was created
5783720	5790160	by a fairchild semiconductor in 1976 it sold for a hundred and sixty nine
5790160	5795040	dollars and ninety five cents which Rob find one of those little like money
5795040	5801000	converter thing which was like 50 Bitcoin back in 1976 you find one of
5801000	5811480	the converters for me 160 995 okay it sold 250,000 units by 1977 it was
5811480	5815880	originally just called the video entertainment system or VES but then
5815880	5823640	Atari released the VCS the next year so they changed the name of the system the
5823640	5829640	channel F it was it was actually one of what what is this talking you sent a
5829640	5836960	video that has some guy I just look for whatever it's fucking blip blip all right
5836960	5841520	blip blip there it is all right okay but anyway one of a couple of the big
5841520	5844760	signifiers of the fairchild channel F it was the first programmable ROM
5844760	5849880	cartridge based video game console and it was the first one that used a micro
5849880	5860160	processor so really the the fairchild channel F is our big big big like
5860160	5866680	granddaddy to what we've got today the the graphics I mean they're fairly
5866720	5872680	basic it was the 70s you know when pong was the thing at the time the resolution
5872680	5883280	is 128 by 64 64 bytes of RAM which is half of what the Atari 2600 had but you
5883280	5890800	it had enough AI compatibility or a I was sort of thinking of capability so
5890800	5896000	that you could play versus the machine and it was also another first so this
5896000	5902840	really did I'd say pave the way for a lot of what we have today it also had a
5902840	5907480	hold button which would let you pause your game you could also change the time
5907480	5912840	or change the speed of your game in the first iterations of the fairchild
5912840	5919320	channel F it had an internal speaker but the system to put that out through an RF
5919320	5925400	modulator so that your TV would play it now the the controllers I'll tell you
5925400	5929960	this they're they're kind of shite they're they're different because I mean
5929960	5935320	back then I mean people hadn't really locked down to any particular controller
5935320	5944120	style there were these these sticks that had a little analog peg on it well not
5944120	5949800	analog but it was an eight-way directional control and it can be used
5949800	5955320	as a paddle to twist it or it could be used as a joystick and it could be
5955320	5961440	pushed in as a fire button so it was really very versatile it just wasn't
5961440	5968320	very great and they also had another controller that was that well first of
5968320	5971680	all the first version they were hardwired and the system to they were
5971680	5978320	detachable a company called zircon offered another one that had an action
5978320	5982400	button on the front of the joystick it was called the channel F jet stick came
5982400	5989000	out in 1982 and even though the channel F wasn't all that great people did
5989000	5993520	really like the the joystick it was really novel I personally did not care
5993520	5998880	for it myself there were a lot of video carts that came out that's what they
5998880	6005040	called their cartridges some of them could do more than one game and they
6005040	6010640	were roughly 20 bucks a pop each of them was the size actually kind of about
6010640	6013200	the size and shape of an 8-track cartridge which none of y'all know what
6013200	6018600	that is unless you're us or you've been to like a garage sale or or a flea
6018600	6023880	market you know I had a collection of 8 tracks when I was a kid my grandma had
6023880	6029400	an Abba 8 track she's awesome anyway I want to answer an earlier question real
6029400	6034400	quick okay hundred sixty nine dollars in 1976 worth seven hundred and twenty
6034400	6039280	seven dollars and four cents today yeah and because I know the chatters are
6039280	6043840	gonna ask that's about one and a half a theory on the current rate whatever
6043840	6050960	anyway as of 1978 there were three keyboard video carts for sale there was
6050960	6056240	k1 casino poker k2 space odyssey in k3 pro football and they were supposed to
6056280	6061440	use the keyboard peripheral that was supposed to come out with it but yeah
6061440	6066040	they're all the video cards like word were numbered and like the very last one
6066040	6072600	that came out in December 1981 was called alien invasion the very first one
6072600	6079120	September 1977 was just the demo card so you know there were there was like a
6079120	6084760	pinball game and hangman and video whiz ball which just makes me laugh whiz ball
6084760	6090600	but the keyboard ones were never released they there was a German company
6090600	6094240	that released a few compatible cartridges as well but for the most part
6094240	6102080	the the channel F was pretty much in general a commercial failure you know
6102080	6109760	trying to compete with you know by 1982 when Atari had so many other games out
6109760	6112880	and then there was also the Intellivision the astrocade the Odyssey
6112880	6119360	you know the channel F was just below average according to its rating you know
6119360	6124400	it didn't really have a whole lot of interest in it and so in 1983 zircon
6124400	6131840	discontinued the fairchild channel F and it was basically what no one wanted it
6131840	6141920	was so a little bit of the the specs for it a fairchild 8-bit processor a 1.7 9
6141920	6148440	megahertz NTSC processor 2 kilobytes of RAM with 64 bytes for its scratchpad
6148440	6160520	memory 128 by 64 pixels monitor 60 Hertz refresh rate 8 colors 8 by 8 by 8 or 4
6160520	6169040	by 5 variable sprite size and that's it the fairchild channel F there it is your
6169040	6172600	classic system of the month I say I would question mark is the system
6172600	6177880	doesn't sound that classic but notable if nothing else it led to having it was
6177880	6181440	the first used cartridges that's true it was first with a microprocessor that's
6181440	6187320	true so it had a creator of this passed away in the past year or two I believe
6187320	6192240	because I remember seeing a story about it and in that we had him to thank for
6192240	6200960	the cartridge based gaming and all that yeah his name was is slash was Jerry
6200960	6207680	Lawson yeah yeah so and you know again not the greatest one but would we have
6207680	6214280	had what we had you know at the time and on top of this too you know just to
6214280	6221120	point out he was a african-american gentleman doing computer programming in
6221120	6225320	an age where you didn't hear about a lot of african-american you did not
6225320	6229720	programming and so like there weren't a lot of women doing programming either
6229720	6232920	which is why it's great that the Game Awards recognized Carol Shaw by the way
6232920	6237000	I just had to make sure that got it was women who put man on the moon that's
6237000	6241800	true enough but yeah he passed away April 9th 2011 oh that was I was a
6241800	6246440	longer time ago than I thought I thought that was more recent but okay yeah but
6246440	6252040	you know we we have him to thank for what we have today all right know your
6252040	6257400	history folks there it is the classic system of the month and that brings the
6257400	6263800	classic system series to a close how do you feel looking back dark soccer how
6263800	6267880	do you feel about the classic system of the month did you like that as a 2017
6267880	6271800	twist it was fun what did the listeners think I came up with it to be different
6271800	6274920	yeah and so I wouldn't have to think of a you know at least 12 games you have to
6274920	6279000	be bitingly different by the way let's just recap just so y'all remember so
6279000	6284000	let's take let's take a trip down memory lane of our trips down memory lane it's
6284000	6293080	actually not our trip down memory lane in January we had the FM towns Marty
6293080	6302120	February was the PC FX March was the WonderSwan April was the MSX May was the
6302120	6310600	TI 99 4a June was the Magnavox Odyssey 2 July was the ZX spectrum or the ZX
6310600	6315720	August was the engage September although I think we technically did that in
6315720	6321280	October but it was September was the Panasonic Q actual October was the
6321280	6327960	Pippen November was the X 86,000 and we closed it out for December with the
6327960	6336480	Fairchild channel so there it is your 2017 twist of the classic system of the
6336480	6342360	month you know the very first video game system I ever personally owned was a ti
6342360	6350160	99 mine was a Commodore 64 I'm pretty sure so we had a clico Adam as well but
6350160	6357120	the ti 99 was the first one um the second one that we owned we when I was a
6357120	6362080	kid I never owned an Atari an Atari system yeah we had a clico vision and
6362080	6366520	that thing fucking rocked I love the clico vision now we are gonna take a
6366520	6371520	quick break but at 68,000 did I screw up and say something wrong no no but
6371520	6374680	apparently dark touch yes thinks that you did well it wouldn't be the first
6374680	6378320	time anyway before we can't go to a break we are gonna go to a break here
6378320	6381320	but do we want to tell the listeners what they have to look forward to in
6381320	6386840	2018 sure is the twist don't stop y'all I'm a twisty bitch all right so the
6386840	6391080	classic game of the week will still be here but once a month what's gonna
6391080	6397680	happen we'll have the peripheral of the month where it you don't know what it
6397680	6403320	could be it could be a I'm trying to think of weird was an activator mm-hmm
6403320	6406600	it could be para para biscuits all I have to say is it better be the fucking
6406600	6413560	power glove at some point it's so bad it could be rod caliber there you go so
6413560	6418200	next year you have the classic peripheral of the month that would be a
6418200	6422600	little bit easier to extend into another year there's been plenty of them
6422600	6426840	especially when the a lot of shit pads yeah there's a lot of stuff that comes
6426840	6429760	out and then it kind of goes nowhere maybe I'll just do a family of them or
6429760	6434760	something but you know I tell you one that's gonna have to be on there and
6434760	6437080	I'll go ahead and announce it cuz it's one of my favorite ones and I wish I
6437080	6440800	don't spoil all right no boil a little unless someone wants to you know because
6440800	6444800	so that someone can find me one oh I see for research purpose I want Saturn
6444800	6451760	twin sticks okay for virtual on we've got that we've got the Dreamcast ones
6451760	6458020	well I want 25 Bitcoin you know where I can find that bitch all right maybe the
6458020	6462120	trans vibrator will show up we're gonna take a break you guys but we'll be back
6462120	6465840	after a quick music break there is more of orange laundry to come so don't go
6465840	6469700	anywhere we've got quite a bit of mailbag tonight and your calls at orange
6469700	6474260	lounge radio all one word on Skype when we come back after this with more of
6474260	6478580	orange lounge radio don't go anywhere
6482300	6486980	welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio live tonight December the 10th of
6486980	6491540	2017 with our seven hundred and tenth episode already in progress as we inch
6491540	6495500	closer and closer to the end of the year during the break their dark Sakura
6495500	6498740	tapping away at her Animal Crossing pocket camp because I know she's a huge
6498780	6503660	fan I'm close to level 42 my gosh I can't that's that's I mean that's great
6503660	6507380	but you know I'm just like dang that must take a lot of effort how long it
6507380	6511140	takes being really bored do you just kind of sit there and tap away at it
6511140	6514620	when you're like supposed to be doing stuff must be what it was I don't know
6514620	6517940	watching TV or something but I don't watch TV yeah I know that's what I was
6517940	6520900	thinking is that you don't really I usually will Dan and I would like do
6520900	6524740	YouTube stuff we'll watch it okay I'll have it on like while I'm you know
6524780	6528820	watching stuff on the internet or talking with Becky or something cuz
6528820	6533340	there you go yeah we chatter regularly because we're besties of course that's
6533340	6538100	what that's what happens you know I'll play during my break at work yeah so good
6538100	6543180	deal during my break any I know it's a little early to talk about New Year's
6543180	6546460	resolutions and some people kind of feel and the whole thing anyway but is there
6546460	6549900	anything maybe in 2018 that you're gonna like try to accomplish or something
6549900	6554020	you're trying to do in 2018 no no I don't I don't make the resolutions
6554020	6559780	anymore you know I I'm more do right around you know the ten days between
6559780	6564980	Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur is meant to be spent in introspection deciding
6564980	6569060	what worked for you in the year and what didn't and how to move forward you know
6569060	6574500	having things that you apologize for in the year or things that you regret doing
6574500	6580500	you can say that you apologize or that you regret them but it doesn't make any
6580540	6584540	fucking difference if you don't make an effort to not do those things anymore
6584540	6588700	right and that's more what I'm looking at besides that you know I've got other
6588700	6592540	things that are happening that I think as far as the road there I know I'm
6592540	6597580	getting way too deep into this but it's fine it's but resolutions to me I didn't
6597580	6600540	mean for it to be a deep question but it's okay if it is that's fine no I was
6600540	6603380	just thinking about it cuz it really just it's been something that's been on
6603380	6608020	my mind yeah and I think that the big thing that I really want to do is just
6608020	6613620	be I don't want to say this is bad let's change it I want to be the best
6613620	6617100	version of myself I can be right I guess the way I'm kind of looking at it like
6617100	6620540	you know obviously with your Jewish faith being important to you and in I
6620540	6623140	that totally makes sense that this more like Jewish New Year is a very kind of
6623140	6626380	different sort of tradition for me I don't necessarily have that same thing
6626380	6629500	but you know that 2017 for me and I think everybody out there knows it's
6629500	6632580	been a horrible year for me I mean you guys all know and I was just thinking
6632580	6635900	back today just not only with the whole fact that you know that I lost my mom
6635900	6640220	over the summer but really like but really how long that went on you know
6640220	6644140	that wasn't just like suddenly one day you know in July she was gone but it was
6644140	6647700	just like months and months leading up to that with her being the ICU and
6647700	6650200	everything right not to be a downer right now that's just the reality of you
6650200	6653220	know some kind of looking back at 2017 it was all that and then you know
6653220	6655980	everything that happened with Sanrio knew all the other stuff so I'm really
6655980	6660460	trying to look at it it's like okay you know yes it's just another year but at
6660460	6663460	the same time it's like it's something about like tearing down that calendar
6663460	6667780	and putting the new one up is very much like okay this year is gonna be less
6667780	6671460	suck than 2017 or at least I really hope so I mean there's gonna be things that
6671460	6675700	probably happen then an audio control but like what can I do and you know for
6675700	6678940	me I definitely want to keep doing olr you know I think that's something we
6678940	6684000	all kind of want to keep doing in 2018 I really want to pick up I feel like with
6684000	6688780	the streaming thing I had a lot of great steam going on like my twitch thing and
6688780	6691180	I was getting really good at that especially if you're using steam and
6691180	6694740	then oh yeah who were playing stream games on Twitch and then like I think I
6694740	6697540	think over the summer I really picked that up and I got the affiliate and then
6697540	6700820	like when my mom passed it's like a lot of that hit a brick road and I was kind
6700820	6703980	of like picking it up again and it's like like that train kept derailing and
6703980	6707300	it's like I think that's something that I want to do more of and I know I can do
6707300	6709820	a good job but I'm really gonna have to like I think it's something I'm gonna
6709820	6714140	challenge myself to do in 2018 is really kind of think out in advance the way I
6714140	6719340	know more that more other live streamers do it what am I gonna stream why and
6719340	6724460	when and really try to tack that down as opposed to oh it's a random Friday
6724460	6727660	night and I'm bored I'm gonna play Final Fantasy 14 on my stream I don't think
6727660	6731860	there's anything wrong with that but I do definitely want to try to like try to
6731860	6735540	and I also don't want to say hold myself accountable because that makes myself I
6735540	6739020	don't know that makes it sound like it's a job and not exactly it's a job and not
6739020	6744700	fun but I just I want to kind of maybe try to hold myself to a better schedule
6744700	6748700	if that makes sense that makes sense yeah you know I I have something that I
6748700	6753900	wanted to propose to you offline but I know that oh my god this bunny has an
6753900	6759580	inflatable nozzle in the back of its head anyway um but and this is something
6759580	6765620	that we talked about before was you know doing different and new things in the
6765620	6771300	realm of podcasting right so well we can talk about that more offline yeah I just
6771300	6775580	hit 42 by the way I really truly think it's just a matter of time before I'm
6775940	6780340	doing another podcast for sure unfortunately you guys all know pokey
6780340	6784700	stop podcast that ain't coming back although I do I you know one show that
6784700	6788220	I've been working more with and again with everything that's happened this year
6788220	6793220	I wanted to do more with those guys over at Pokemon go podcast but I just you
6793220	6795260	know with everything that's happened I haven't been able to so I'm hoping to
6795260	6799820	really you know reestablish and you know contribute for that more with with pokey
6799820	6803660	stop podcast being gone I you know I've been talking to X for about guys on a
6803740	6806300	show I just don't know if it's gonna be in the cards for that to come back but
6806300	6808700	I'm hoping it's one of those things where it's like like Arrested
6808700	6811380	Development dropped another season on you all these years later I'm really
6811380	6814940	hoping that's something that can happen but you know we'll see but otherwise
6814940	6820100	maybe something new in 2018 so we'll see reading is fundamental we'll be back I
6820100	6824460	know that but that's that's not my show that's that's John show and I'm just a
6824460	6828580	host on it so you know it's a little different a little different well we'll
6828580	6832020	talk yeah we'll talk we'll talk well you look yeah me me leave you out of the
6832020	6835380	conversation but anything you like it's been and going to our chat room over at
6835380	6839300	live dog network calm come on no Gus says I still have games that I bought
6839300	6842620	during last year's Black Friday that I haven't played you know a lot of people
6842620	6847100	say oh this is the year I'm gonna really dig into my backlog and actually play
6847100	6851380	more games what do you think about gaming wise right now Loki well I have
6851380	6855660	a backlog that's for sure of games I need to play I mean even as both recent
6855660	6861700	South Park the fracture butthole I haven't touched yet bought it it's an
6861700	6869460	assault time lady it mm-hmm yeah I don't know gaming wise I would like to
6869460	6874940	work on my game some more at some point I just I don't know what I want to start
6874940	6878500	I mean cuz I was working on one thing and I just kind of got bored with it
6878500	6882380	like I want to I need to find something that could just finish quickly that
6882380	6887220	doesn't get like ridiculously involved because I think once I finish some games
6887220	6892100	it'll be easier to stick with it longer it's just right now it just I over
6892100	6895260	scope everything and it just gets ridiculous and then I hit a wall with
6895260	6899940	like oh I can't figure one thing out and then I end up quitting like I happen
6899940	6904020	with like I was designing a Lego thing and I needed the design because it's
6904020	6909300	based off a real thing and so these tables are cubicles or deaths or
6909300	6912060	whatever that are in there are triangular they're like shaped like
6912060	6917140	three boomerangs set next to each other you can't fucking make that in Legos
6917140	6921820	at the scale that was doing it I spent weeks on that trying to solve that
6921820	6927700	problem and I just I couldn't get past it and then it just is time wasted and
6927700	6930180	that's kind of like where I run into with like these games and stuff it's
6930180	6935260	like I hit a wall with something that I can't do or something I can't figure out
6935260	6939740	and I waste tons of time on it and I get burnt out on it and it's just because
6939740	6943300	I'm not making any progress it's a small you have to probably commit to smaller
6943300	6948740	pry I want to it but small projects are boring as well but I need to give it at
6948740	6952880	least you'll finish one I understand that but I don't I don't know I had to
6952880	6957960	figure out what I want to do so it's just more of that and then I have to die
6957960	6963900	it so I don't get me started on that so I I do need to do that and I want to get
6963900	6969260	back in the DDR fact actually I won an auction today I could kick myself there
6969260	6977540	was there was some DDR pad stuff that was around here that was really cheap
6977540	6982780	and I let it like got bid on and I forgot the bid on it and stuff and I
6982780	6988700	could have won that but no I bought I have a set of arcade plates at home the
6988700	6994740	actual like Lexan and not Lexan the polycarbonate like actual arrow panels
6994740	6998900	so I have one set of those and I wanted to so I bought another set they don't
6998940	7004220	match and the other set it's not the you know two and two it's like three and one
7004220	7012100	but whatever as long as it works so now I have those I have parts to build new
7012100	7015980	pads but I have to design those from scratch as well because it's gonna be a
7015980	7021760	completely new design so we'll see if I get around to that ever to clean the
7021760	7025780	garage first Bobby black wolf with a witty little commentary here in chat at
7025780	7029500	live.vog network.com says finishing games is boring starting them is fun
7029500	7032740	that's why most people never finish their games and why most kickstarters
7032740	7037340	fail that's why me doing the show is fun me editing the show and posting it is
7037340	7042180	boring that's uh well Bobby you know my philosophy is that's why I don't edit
7042180	7048820	and and some other podcasters like to roast for this whole thing but I don't
7048820	7051860	want to be I don't want to be petty but I know you know I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm
7051860	7056060	gonna because at the same time I also got Ross it roasted by podcasters not
7056060	7063300	that long ago about why aren't you on patreon and well well okay I don't want
7063300	7066260	to have to deliver on all the stupid things whether you didn't did you hear
7066260	7069300	about the patreon controversy this we know what happened in the price they
7069300	7072580	change their pricing structure has people up in arms so but anyway I don't
7072580	7076420	want to repeat that whole thing but anyway just sometimes I just I just got
7076420	7080340	a march to the beat of my own drum and I don't if you want to do patreon that is
7080340	7084700	fucking rad you do what works for you I support that that's awesome you know but
7084700	7088820	I'm gonna do me you know what though hmm I don't think I would be opposed to
7088820	7094220	doing like a donation I take the biddies on Twitch so and that's cool you know
7094220	7098620	especially but I do but yet it does bring those feelings of guilt when it's
7098620	7104700	like Rob you haven't streamed in like two weeks but it's like I just if I keep
7104700	7107460	putting myself out there like that I'm gonna go fucking nuts you know so
7107460	7110780	sometimes I just can't do it I would still I'm gonna put the call out right
7110780	7114860	now because I've wanted to do this for a little while and I didn't have enough
7114860	7122220	material mm-hmm if anybody out there has pictures from being with us or pictures
7122220	7126460	of you guys what have we ever been out there in public hardly ever well I was
7126460	7129980	once in a great while I've met some of the listeners in Alabama sack indie
7129980	7135340	arcade you know dragon call your I see people dragon or any just pictures of
7135340	7138780	yourself that you want to you know add in a little bit of something to
7138780	7141740	contribute to it I'm still pointing to put together a kind of an art book in
7141740	7145700	history book so if anyone has anything they want to contribute to it you send
7145700	7150340	it to the mailbag okay that picture of me in New York like over ten years ago
7150340	7154700	at this point I have one of you and me when I still had like that kind of hot
7154700	7162620	fuchsia red hair and I was probably thin and had on my hair huh no comment yes
7162620	7168420	it's fine a little more ginger it was a little more ginger let's see over at
7168420	7172540	live.vog network.com Bobby Black Wolf says there's an animal crossing animal
7172540	7177700	that calls me bitty I think her Rob every time oh there you go all right we
7177700	7181700	got more video game stuff to get into rapid-fire news Loki yeah so it's that
7181700	7185740	time of year where we can announce more delays that's right some games that
7185740	7190300	you're looking forward to in the first half of next year well they're gonna be
7190300	7194820	a little later so all of these happen to be from Ubisoft starting off Far Cry
7194820	7199420	5 which was scheduled originally for February it's now coming out March 27
7199420	7205500	2018 the crew 2 is gonna be out later next year as well and there apparently
7205500	7210940	was an unannounced game that they were gonna have coming out but I guess that's
7210940	7218380	scheduled now for financial year 2018 2019 which is between April and March of
7218380	7227300	2019 so yeah that's kind of lame Far Cry looked interesting but yeah a month
7227300	7231700	that's not it's not a big that's nothing you know what it's nothing get it right
7231700	7237940	so finally at long last the time has come where everybody that was hoping
7237940	7243740	that someday we'd be able to unlock jetpacks in Grand Theft Auto 5 well now
7243740	7248340	thanks to the brand new Grand Theft Auto online doomsday heists you'll be able
7248340	7252140	to actually get jetpacks and so they're actually gonna take place inside Mount
7252140	7258020	Chiliad they've got a bunch of new events going on along with that so it's
7258020	7263220	coming out actually on December 12th and with that they've got you know jetpacks
7263220	7269500	there's even like a flying car that I saw submersible car and lots of new
7269500	7275860	vehicles so games getting more ridiculous as it is was it like okay so
7275860	7279020	that helicopter looks like there's something from airwolf that that car
7279020	7282700	looks like it's from Jean doesn't play the airwolf theme song yeah you need to
7282700	7289060	find us some airwolf now Rob does it does it play the airwolf NES game no it
7289060	7293220	doesn't but yeah it looks interesting so the whole premise is apparently a mill a
7293220	7298180	billionaire tech mogul and idealistic intelligence agent and a socially
7298180	7302140	awkward conspiracy theorist and a neurotic supercomputer have been forced
7302140	7308420	into an unlikely alliance to save San Andreas from total annihilation as an
7308420	7313420	apocalyptic threats mount from enemies unknown you and your criminal crew are
7313420	7319300	enlisted to untangle mysteries and eradicate threats spanning from the
7319300	7324300	bustling streets of downtown Los Santos to the ocean floor and all the way to
7324300	7329220	the inner depths of Mount Chiliad an epic new online adventure that's it I'm
7329220	7335620	gonna make a proposition right now what Loki's rapid-fire news to airwolf
7342820	7347540	wait what why the fuck if they rebooted like every third okay I don't know
7347540	7351580	writers they rebooted like with all those fucking reboots they've done how
7351580	7359740	have they not rebooted airwolf and the love boat how are they not rebooted
7359740	7363820	because I was okay so you know how this is one of those nights at OLR right
7363820	7367420	because here I go I'm gonna take it to a place I'm gonna take it to a place so
7367420	7370460	you know how sometimes you just fall down those random YouTube pits or
7370460	7373020	sometimes right we like you're watching all these different youtubes do you know
7373020	7377740	the you know the random YouTube pit I fell into the other day 80 shows clips
7377740	7384900	of Charo on various television shows because Charo is the best like sir try
7384900	7389380	and she's still doing her shit coochie coochie coo it started I think with one
7389380	7393940	of my friends posted Charo I'm like the Pee Wee Christmas special where she was
7393940	7397420	singing Feliz Navidad right that whole thing and then that led to a whole thing
7397420	7401100	where I was watching Charo on Hollywood Squares and then of course Charlie
7401100	7406340	Charo on the love boat and she was on Drag Race yeah I was I was there at the
7406340	7411740	finale she was that I have seen Charo in person that is something I can cross
7411740	7415980	off my buddy I'm like the celebrity apprentice or like god I hope not I
7415980	7418940	don't think she was the one where they all lived together a while the surreal
7418940	7424060	the surreal life that's right yes she what Charo was on that yes do you know
7424060	7427600	what my dream is is there somebody out there they could have Charo tape a very
7427600	7433040	special introduction for orange on radio like I just like before I die is that a
7433040	7437280	thing that could happen like Charo does the intro like Jason I love you you do
7437280	7440920	wonderful things for the show you but but just for why I think Jason would
7440920	7444760	even understand for one week can Charo do the intro do they have like a
7444760	7452420	convention that she would go to I don't know we need actually maybe she does go
7452420	7456840	to drag I am going to drag con next year that's something that's gonna have to
7456840	7461840	happen all right that's the show 100 Matt says Charo is all over the I love
7461840	7467120	the blank and other vh1 shows oh my god they said that they did reboot the love
7467120	7474120	boat in the 2000 early 2000s I don't even remember that I remember once I
7474120	7479880	like speed too so I mean that's true when I used to do live-action vampire
7479880	7484800	roleplay yes I did vampire LARP uh-huh we had a group of us who walk around in
7484800	7489400	our theme song was the blood boat we had lyrics to it and everything I don't
7489520	7494520	remember how all of them went but it was pretty funny Oh LARPing hey let's move
7494520	7499520	on I got some more news for you yeah let's talk a little bit about a game
7499520	7502960	that has been announced with some alpha footage out there on YouTube called
7502960	7507960	super retro maker so this is somebody taking Mario maker type of thing to the
7507960	7512800	next level you can make stages inspired by I'm using that my quote II fingers
7512800	7518600	inspired by games like Megaman Contra Strider Castlevania and more because if
7518600	7521560	you actually look at the trailer look at these characters it's not quite
7521560	7526920	Megaman it's like you know Maga Mon or something
7526920	7536320	Danky Kang Princess Zordla Zorlda Sornik the hedge goat Santa Santa
7536320	7542480	Santa the hedge goat and all that stuff and then don't forget Samus's Celtic
7542480	7549320	cousin Seamus are on Seamus and lonk so anyway so in super retro maker you have
7549320	7551840	all these characters in the game and like you can actually build like
7551840	7555920	basically like looks like a Metroidvania type of game if you want or you can make
7555920	7559880	games inspired by you know other types of 80s games I think it's really cool it
7559880	7562880	is something that's gonna be coming to steam they say it's gonna has a
7562880	7566920	projected release in 2018 so you can check out the trailer there at super
7566920	7570520	retro maker I was hoping when dark to see opposed to that new story for us I
7570520	7573800	was hoping that that meant the game was already out but sadly no they're just
7573800	7577720	announcing that that's a thing that's gonna happen but kind of cool something
7577720	7582960	that may happen a little sooner is the US release of DJ Max respect this game
7582960	7587160	has already been out overseas for a little bit I know Shane downloaded it on
7587160	7590960	his PlayStation 4 so I've played it but it is nice to see that it is going to
7590960	7594880	get a digital released anyway here in the US and that's coming up early next
7594880	7598480	year I don't know if we know the exact date but if you want to get in the know
7598480	7606440	you can actually be a DJ Max respect partner as part of their partner program
7606440	7611160	if you get into the partner program you would get a complimentary download code
7611160	7615640	you get an unlock all music code for event mode you get the chance to play
7615640	7620200	and stream with a developer and you get a DJ Max emote icon which is some type
7620200	7624160	of emoji you can use and I guess some type of ps4 plate I don't know if
7624160	7626840	that's like a replacement little front plate or something that you can do with
7626840	7631280	that but that's pretty cool but of course you can stream and you just don't
7631280	7634160	want to have inappropriate material with all that stuff but definitely they're
7634160	7639000	trying to reach out to some of you twitch people to get you to basically
7639000	7642800	advertise their game but hey that's how that's how it works in the year 2018
7642800	7646760	when this game will be out yep yep all right let's move on Dark
7646760	7650800	Sakura um well there's gonna be a live-action Pokemon movie and Ryan
7650800	7659920	Reynolds is Pikachu oh I don't get it well I detective Pikachu sorry it's not
7659920	7665800	Danny DeVito but I feel like we're gonna get Ryan Reynolds as Danny DeVito as
7665800	7669520	detective Pikachu Ryan Reynolds ain't stupid he knows what the internet wants
7669520	7674360	and he gives you just they want he does give him what he's gonna be like dead
7674360	7678360	pull at you I'm kind of fine with it yeah I still wanted anything like if
7678360	7682880	Danny DeVito was gonna be whiny and not gonna do it then fine Ryan Reynolds is
7682880	7688640	you know I was maybe number two on the list so sure I just remember when he was
7688640	7691920	on that two guys in a pizza place show that was fucking garbage but I'm glad
7691920	7695320	his career has come along honestly we just need to have like several Pokemon
7695320	7698620	and just get the whole cast if it's always sunny in Philadelphia to just do
7698620	7702260	the voices there that's my dream movie all right I need to respond to act
7702260	7706200	Efton check his act Efton chat over at live dog vog network comm says why do
7706240	7711440	people want Danny DeVito as Pikachu it's the worst choice act Efton I feel like
7711440	7715920	you're not watching it's always sunny in Philadelphia and you need to watch the
7715920	7720680	show they have to understand they have a clip of detective Pikachu with Danny
7720680	7724760	DeVito from it's always sunny in Philadelphia perfect I mean perfect you
7724760	7727840	know go watch that clip only thing I know if it's always sunny in Philadelphia
7727840	7732040	is because I watch binging with Babish huh who does like recreations of stuff
7732040	7736480	from TV and movies and he did the rum-soaked ham okay it's always sunny is
7736480	7739480	one of those shows that like when it's bad it's pretty fucking bad but when
7739480	7746560	it's good it's really fucking funny like some of those episodes I like I hurt
7746560	7750780	from laughing so hard and that rarely happens to me I just don't find humor
7750780	7754040	funny but I'm not afraid to say some episodes of South Park and I know some
7754040	7757440	people don't like South Park but you know so and it South Park I would say
7757440	7759480	there's another one of those shows that when it's bad it's pretty fucking bad
7759680	7764600	but when South Park's funny it is fucking funny but anyway that's just my
7764600	7770440	my thoughts on the matter there okay I'll post the link in chat that's
7770440	7774920	basically act after saying I've seen the clip it's the worst choice I like Danny
7774920	7781960	DeVito blah blah blah blah you're watching again so it is done all right
7781960	7791760	anyway Jamie yeah whatever I can't so other news streets of rage is also out
7791760	7800120	for mobile devices and it has local cross-platform multiplayer so you can
7800120	7807120	play on iOS or Android and you can beat them up with some bare knuckle which was
7807120	7811800	of course streets of rage over here and that's it I have nothing more to be
7811800	7816040	rapping about all right then let's uh well I'm I think this segment will go by
7816040	7819200	quick because this close to Christmas I can't imagine we have a lot in stores

7962280	7965840	like quite a few games coming out on the yeah yeah PSX they did kind of drop a
7965920	7970560	few video games which is really strong like a more powerful Vita and just kind
7970560	7974000	of go with that I know it's so weird how Sony would walk away from either or
7974000	7977480	something like that yeah I would never I'm still never gonna understand why
7977480	7981480	Sony just like completely abandoned that thing but I guess not everything is

8023240	8031080	let us now go to the mailbag every week you guys send us emails and we answer
8031080	8034880	participate at orange lounge radio comm is the place to send emails and we
8034880	8039920	actually have a few tonight sorry you may not be prepared for this order but I
8039920	8043160	know that why we are sent one at the end of the shirt like while we were live
8043160	8046440	last week but the show was so short we never got to it so I don't know if you
8046440	8050480	want to do that one first I already had it well you read my mind you should do
8050480	8056600	that more often hello LR I was kind of surprised to hear Rob's take on user
8056600	8061000	reviews specifically how he didn't put a whole lot of stock into them customer
8061000	8065040	reviews have been heavily influencing my purchasing decisions for many years now
8065040	8069680	first place I really paid attention to them actually was game facts I didn't
8069680	8073400	pay a ton of attention to the score out of 10 what I looked at were the specific
8073400	8077320	details in the reviews themselves by looking at both those specific details
8077320	8081240	in the general consensus across several reviews I could generally determine
8081240	8085580	whether I should spend my money on a particular game or not in the end I also
8085580	8089760	wrote several detailed reviews for game facts and one review of the month twice
8089760	8096560	I use the same practice today across team Amazon Newegg and even Yelp I look
8096560	8100920	at multiple reviews use the same combination of details and consensus to
8100920	8105040	form an opinion for myself you can also learn a lot of things about a game or
8105040	8108720	product or restaurant from a customer review the only able to find from the
8108720	8112640	back of a box from an online menu things like the controls feel floaty but still
8112640	8117100	responsive or the campaign only lasts four hours or the filling is really
8117100	8120360	spicy or the manufacturer says the battery last eight hours but actually
8120360	8125920	lasted ten I guess what I'm saying is I would I've been relying on customer
8125920	8129640	reviews is a good source of information and I would personally give them a high
8129640	8134880	rating probably a 4.7 out of 5 but I understand that people can disagree with
8134880	8138720	me and that's fine I will look forward to the end of tonight's show when Rob
8138720	8141760	will end it by saying a nice five-star review on iTunes may or may not actually
8141760	8145720	go a long way since it's an online review whatever look at this bitch
8145720	8148920	trying to come for me on my own damn show let me finish reading the email
8148920	8155040	rub I'm kidding of course and I stand by my five-star review of olr oh I have a

8184380	8188620	bitch but I'm gonna I'm gonna if he came here to play I'm gonna throw down no
8188620	8191660	that's coming for you I'd catch you that's right if he gonna come for me
8191660	8196500	then he might be ready cuz my nails have been sharpened so anyway no here's the
8196500	8199860	theater here's the thing I was feeling very attacked well I think yes right I
8199860	8203540	just came here to have a good time I'm feeling very attacked no here's the
8203540	8208300	thing with the customer reviews for me there is it and again for me you
8208300	8211500	explained how they work for you and that's fine you know again I don't I'm
8211540	8214900	not gonna tell people how to spend their money but for me I don't really care
8214900	8218620	what a lot of strangers think about things because I know a lot of this
8218620	8223580	campaign shit goes on to downvote games and things like that however do I put
8223580	8228620	stock in what my friends on Twitter say about a game abso-fucking-lutely and I
8228620	8233100	have swayed been swayed on the fence one way or the other based on some of the
8233100	8237660	reactions of people I know and how they react to particular games and things
8237660	8241420	like that when it comes to the iTunes reviews and why I beg for them at the
8241420	8244900	end of every show even though you said just kidding I am gonna just explain for
8244900	8249780	people who go well he does make a point here's the thing iTunes really does weigh
8249780	8253900	that stuff like and it will help with visibility if you have more positive
8253900	8257260	reviews and more interactions that are going on with your show and stuff so
8257260	8262540	whether I put any stock in him or not I just know the reality is that then why I
8262540	8266020	beg for that stuff and why any podcaster you're listening to is begging for that
8266020	8272060	stuff really is because iTunes the the one big big problem with iTunes right
8272060	8276580	now is that it really can be a dumping ground for podcasts and what I mean by
8276580	8281220	that is there's a lot of shows that I look that are in like the top 200 they
8281220	8284540	haven't fucking put a new show out since like February or March these shows are
8284540	8289860	like done you know but iTunes still continues to kind of put them where they
8289860	8293540	are because they don't weigh them by like how long they've like the last
8293540	8297540	release of it yeah you would think you would think but I don't know anyway so I
8297540	8301060	kind of that's that's for Apple to figure out with iTunes and I understand
8301060	8304900	that podcasting is a tricky thing and then when it comes to Spotify like I
8304900	8309220	really would love to get on Spotify podcast but with Spotify podcast like
8309220	8312820	you pretty much have to be through lips in to get through that whole thing and
8312820	8318700	so that feels kind of super limiting so I don't know and then we used to be on
8318700	8322540	stitcher and I'm gonna tell you why I took us off of stitcher in case you
8322540	8325660	weren't around to hear that I took us off of stitcher because stitcher when
8325660	8328720	they had their buyout and then they got bought again they were having so many
8328720	8332660	technical problems that our show was not updating on stitcher when we were
8332660	8335820	putting out new episodes and this was gone for months and I sent emails and
8335820	8338740	they went on responded to us I said you know what I'm pulling our show from
8338740	8342620	stitcher because it's not fair that we're getting emails asking oh did you
8342620	8345320	guys do a new show this week why can't I listen to your show and it's like I'm
8345320	8349480	here promoting stitcher and they can't like why can't they just directly tap
8349480	8353440	into the feed and I understand it's one of the things that it might be fixed now
8353440	8359400	but I've done gone and moved on so that's why we're not on stitcher but
8359400	8364240	just about everywhere else you can get podcasts we're there so or you can just
8364240	8368140	go straight to vog network calm and listen right there in the browser same
8368140	8371720	thing I think even an orange launch radio calm I think I like using use that
8371720	8375960	ten-year-old technology to listen to my podcast cuz I have an Android phone I
8375960	8382280	use the Google Play in the music thing and do my podcast through there and it
8382280	8389400	works we're always updated no all right so so there you go so anyway with the
8389400	8394120	user reviews I think I kind of hopefully clarified that I I will listen to users
8394120	8397960	when I know them but when they're just strangers on the internet I'm kind of
8397960	8403360	like I don't I don't you know I just I just don't put a lot of stock in them
8403360	8407640	it's not to say I've ignored them a hundred percent of the time but I do
8407640	8411200	this if to be fair this isn't just with games I do the same thing with Yelp
8411200	8414880	reviews because I know that people will go on Yelp and they're only gonna say
8414880	8418160	the bad things or they're friends with the owner and they're only gonna say the
8418160	8424880	good things so there's a lot that I read on Yelp that I go hmm I'm more likely to
8424880	8428640	believe a three-star review on Yelp than anything else well here's what I
8428640	8433040	normally do is I look at what like how in-depth the review is and what it the
8433040	8437120	criteria is so like especially if it's like a product review like I want to
8437120	8442160	know what it was that was broken on air why you didn't like it and like give the
8442160	8445520	positives and negatives and that type of thing because if you're just like well I
8445520	8451200	didn't like it cuz it arrived effective that doesn't help me because that can
8451200	8456600	happen but I don't know it you just have to kind of look at it and a lot of them
8456600	8461960	are like yeah it was awesome okay why was it awesome because it was
8461960	8467880	awesome all right thanks for the email nonetheless why why are it was it was a
8467880	8474160	fun debate and I do still really want to play your game so let's do that I was
8474160	8478200	dream your game you feel let me but I understand you may not be ready for that
8478200	8484800	next email hello peoples in what ways are the movie fruitvale station in the
8484800	8489400	game present evil 7 similar both are projects that receive lots of praise the
8489400	8493240	year they came out both are projects that first came out in January of the
8493240	8497080	year they were released when the end of the year awards came out in each of
8497080	8500640	these projects perspective fields both projects fail to receive a nomination in
8500640	8505720	the category best media form why did neither of these projects garner such
8505720	8510080	nominations that can be attributed to both of these projects being released in
8510080	8514400	January and by the end of the year the people who put together the awards
8514400	8518640	forgetting how impactful these projects were also because people suck resident
8518640	8522560	evil 7 for game of the year fruitvale station for best picture in 2013 stay
8522560	8528480	black entertainment no I agree I forgot resident evil 7 came out this year yeah
8528480	8531960	I totally forgot about resident evil 7 this year as well but what here here's
8531960	8538400	my my real question did it really um was it was resident evil 7 really as good as
8538400	8542560	breath of the wild and Super Mario I know no but it probably was as good as
8542560	8552400	probably like what's the other one horizon zero dawn I mean it's probably
8552400	8562640	it's been a hard year forget I mean it's been it's been a hard year to rank games
8562640	8566720	because there's been a lot of good games that's that's a that's actually great
8566720	8571560	news to hear when something like resident evil 7 isn't up for game of the
8571560	8575320	year because there's that many good games to choose from in a way that's
8575320	8579160	kind of good news now fruit veals fruitvale station that's a whole nother
8579160	8583120	you know issue over there I believe though I just went to the wiki page real
8583120	8587640	quick as I was curious fruitvale station got its Sundance release in January and
8587640	8591600	then it got its wide release in July so you would think maybe people would
8591600	8597520	remember it more but when it comes to awards movies usually not always usually
8597520	8601420	those movies tend to come out towards the end of the year that's why you have
8601420	8604860	stuff like Lady Bird the disaster artist and these movies that they're
8604860	8607500	talking about getting awards are coming out towards the end of the year and
8607500	8611500	usually what happens because this is a January thing you get movies that come
8611500	8616060	out in like LA and New York in December to qualify for the Oscars but then they
8616060	8620220	get their wide release in January because not a lot of blockbuster movies
8620220	8626420	come out in January but you know earlier movies have been getting recognized I
8626420	8630860	think a little more often there's a lot of talk that get out is probably gonna
8630860	8634340	be a Best Picture nominee this year get out was so fucking good I haven't seen
8634340	8637740	you yet unfortunately I don't I have a lot of movies oh I mean I may need to
8637740	8640820	borrow it I hear it good yeah I hear it's good too and it probably is gonna
8640820	8645780	get a Best Picture nomination that movie came out kind of early for you know and
8645780	8649940	you know what hmm I think the thing about that movie is that it gets its
8649940	8658700	point across in such a a great way that you can't oh god that movie's just so
8658700	8661820	good it's one of my I would put that as one of my favorite movies of the year
8661820	8666700	yeah I think I don't I I highly doubt you're alone with that so I was trying
8666700	8670180	to see because I thought I found the past couple years we've had like Oscars
8670180	8676900	where movies that work that came out earlier in the year were actually
8676900	8681980	getting nominated but I can't remember I thought was in 2015 or 2016 we had
8681980	8686920	movies that were kind of released a little earlier in the year when did Mad
8686920	8690080	Max Fury Road come out cuz I got a Best Picture nominee that was like a summer
8690080	8694480	blockbuster yeah that was like yeah that's another movie but nobody nobody
8694480	8698840	expected I don't think anybody expected um I mean come on when you heard Mad Max
8698840	8702280	was getting like a sequel I think a lot of people are going I just hope Mel
8702280	8706480	Gibson has nothing to do with it which he didn't and then you know and turns
8706480	8709840	out the movie was that now that movie I did see and that movie was pretty
8709840	8714400	fucking badass and I don't even usually like action movies I haven't seen it
8714440	8721640	it's it's pretty fucking good I was very very impressed anyway let's move on next
8721640	8729080	email next email alright hold on there it is with the switch port of Outlast
8729080	8732920	announced I was thinking about the owner of a small arcade and toy shop
8732920	8737520	specifically the neutral zone in Chesterfield Mall in St. Louis and
8737520	8741900	asking him as well as you while Outlast, Amnesia, the multiplayer Dead by
8741900	8746060	Daylight and a myriad of games full of tension and jump scares have defined
8746060	8750660	YouTube's let's play channels most arcade games of the genre have been
8750660	8754600	action games with horror themes your ghosts and goblins your house of the
8754600	8759500	dead and so on for a few places where arcade games is still a thing what are
8759500	8762620	the chances of the cabinet that gives the same level of tension and
8762620	8768500	helplessness of the better computer games how would such an experience
8768500	8771980	translate to coin-op gaming what general audience design would you
8771980	8777300	suggest well if and that's from Robert M if you remember there were survival
8777300	8782700	horror games that like there was the whole gun survivor series you know there
8782700	8789500	was I guess not too many in the realm of scary but here's the problem is that in
8789500	8793820	arcades there's going to be a lot of noise and that noise is gonna take you
8793820	8797220	out of the experience a little bit because you know these places are
8797220	8801540	sometimes referred to as amusement centers so survival horror games aren't
8801540	8805860	always necessarily you know amusing and I think the reason why people have the
8805860	8808820	reactions that you see on youtubes and stuff and I know you know having
8808820	8813360	streamed some of those scary games like years ago when God what was that fucking
8813360	8818620	game that got me like to scream on and it wasn't even five nights as the other
8818620	8822460	was Slender Man okay that's the one I play and I was like oh my like I was
8822460	8826620	like crying it was so horrible you can't really replicate that in the arcade
8826660	8830660	because when I'm playing at home I have headphones on the lights are off maybe
8830660	8834620	and I'm in the zone looking at my monitor there's nothing really to break
8834620	8837780	that atmosphere but when you're at an arcade it's loud it's noisy there's
8837780	8842060	little kids running right through your game so I think it's harder to get in
8842060	8846420	that experience you know but like Jamie said there's been some like you know a
8846420	8851540	Silent Hill had an arcade game but it wasn't really scary it was just pew pew
8851540	8855180	pew shoot him up with a gun all the pyramid head and all the things from
8855180	8858500	Silent Hill wasn't really the same thing you can't mess with people's heads
8858500	8862500	and allowed arcade I mean truly and on top of that the whole point I mean in
8862500	8868060	the end with with coin up games is to make people put more coin in the game oh
8868060	8872260	that's that's a good point and if you poop scared out of you you're not gonna
8872260	8875220	want to do that no no no that's not really what I'm talking about you can't
8875220	8881180	build up the level of suspense needed especially if you were having to stop in
8881180	8887620	the experience to put another coin in just saying okay fair enough I think we
8887620	8890020	gave some good explanations at least I hope we did thanks for the email though
8890020	8896980	yeah because we're smart people we'd like to think we are so modest exactly
8896980	8902460	we're very humble too hello olr why are some people against emulation of older
8902460	8908380	games but on the other how many times do you really play said older game maybe
8908540	8913460	15 minutes after which the nostalgia has died down emulation is also often the
8913460	8917500	only chance to play an older arcade game anyway as always thank you for making
8917500	8922500	the podcast yours truly Fabrice from Belgium I personally don't have a
8922500	8926220	problem with it the only people who have a problem with it I think are number one
8926220	8934220	collectors who want to keep the value of their games higher I mean honestly enough
8934220	8938580	Dan and I are gonna start selling off the collection so that's fine the other
8938580	8944740	thing too I think goes with having the people who hold the licenses for some of
8944740	8948860	these games who might want to do like a best-of collection or make their money
8948860	8955980	selling you know those those like flashbacks and things like that so it
8955980	8961460	really is is coming back to you know who's got their hand in the pocket I
8961580	8967140	think with emulation sometimes you know well you know having the hardware
8967140	8970700	perfect thing is very important for some people but honestly I think the way that
8970700	8974460	services like virtual console and some of the you know official repackaging is
8974460	8978620	and stuff the way they do it is well enough especially for people to be able
8978620	8981900	to play games that maybe they missed the first time around they were too young to
8981900	8987900	play the first time around or what have you so emulation is great for that but
8987900	8990660	you do bring up a very good point and a lot of people do this with emulators is
8990660	8995020	that now when you have a buffet in front of you and you know the way some people
8995020	8998460	do emulators they'll download the emulator and let's say they download an
8998460	9003860	Atari 2600 emulator and then like how you can download like every single
9003860	9011060	Atari 2600 game ever fucking made would fit on like an old floppy disk probably
9011060	9014660	like those games were not very big right and there was only so many hundred of
9014660	9018900	them so my point is many people also download every fucking ROM when they
9018900	9022140	download the game I realize that's not really the legal thing you're supposed
9022140	9025220	to do but I just I know that's what a lot of people do and so it's kind of
9025220	9027860	like you're all of a sudden at this buffet and it's like oh I want to try a
9027860	9030060	little bit that I want a little bit that I want to try a little bit that I want
9030060	9034060	that that that oh my gosh I guess my eyes are bigger than my stomach you type
9034060	9038620	of thing so I think people just kind of get the whole like attention span you
9038620	9043100	know it gets harder and especially the older the game gets because when you go
9043100	9048460	back to an Atari 2600 game a lot of them were kind of repetitive but that's what
9048540	9053500	we had and that was the game and there was something about that repetition that
9053500	9058540	can actually be a little bit kind of Zen or you know it's kind of like when you're
9058540	9062660	building blocks in Minecraft that could be very a lot of repetition as well it's
9062660	9068420	just a different kind so going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com OMG in our
9068420	9072020	chat says emulators bring an embarrassment of riches it's always
9072020	9076700	choice anxiety for me and I never end up playing anything yeah it's kind of like
9076780	9079740	you start playing one thing and it's like oh I want to go hear this other thing I
9079740	9083740	do that on Spotify I'll start listening to one song and then suddenly that song
9083740	9086020	makes me think of another song that's like I never get more than halfway
9086020	9091980	through any song dark to see you makes a point here in our chat at live.vognetwork.com
9091980	9096700	saying that's also why I like the decently sized classic systems
9096700	9101540	Nintendo did you're not overwhelmed maybe that's why they limit it to 30 or
9101540	9105260	you know 24 or whatever the Super Nintendo had anyway you said there was
9105260	9110860	one more Jamie all right we just got another one last minute it says hey OLR

9177320	9182420	Awards was there they had a new trailer for Zelda Breath of the Wild the
9182420	9187180	champions ballot expansion so they showed off a little bit of you know what
9187180	9192900	that was with all the new you know gameplay stuff plus they even had the
9192900	9199060	whole new motorcycle thing that was in there the master cycle zero and then
9199060	9204180	they're like it's available now go download it now so you can go download
9204180	9211340	it now and yeah and and it's good apparently so are you not gonna talk
9211340	9215300	about the loot box thing I thought or did oh no we linked the long wrong thing
9215300	9220060	didn't we son of a bitch I'm seeing that because I was sorry Jamie talked
9220060	9223500	about that earlier in the show I thought that she did too you know and that bad
9223500	9228220	link in our show role sorry that's my bad so no no that's alright so we can
9228220	9232540	yeah I guess we can talk about the legislation yes I'm kind of running back
9232540	9236820	to you know what the whole loot box thing with Star Wars Battlefront there
9236820	9243860	was you know obviously Hawaii was one of the states they had some senators come
9243900	9249700	out talking about you know what needs to happen with that and so they're coming
9249700	9252300	out with like kind of what their solution would be for that so they do
9252300	9257980	want to fight the predatory behavior of loot boxes and so Republican or
9257980	9264140	representative Chris Lee he basically said that you know of course he made the
9264140	9269780	joke because the Star Wars that it's a trap that there's they would like we're
9269780	9273820	stepping up to act in Hawaii we have also been in discussion with our
9273820	9277180	counterparts in a number of other states who are also considering on how to
9277180	9282140	address this issue change is difficult at the federal level but states can and
9282140	9286820	are taking action so they're saying if even elected officials can't do it alone
9286820	9291100	they would need your support and you can compel them by you know reaching out to
9291100	9295500	your local representatives these kind of loot boxes and microtransactions are
9295500	9299620	explicitly designed to prey upon exploit human psychology the same way
9299620	9304580	casino games are so designed and this is especially true for young adults who
9304580	9310140	can't who child psychologists and other experts explain are particularly
9310140	9314340	vulnerable these exploitative mechanisms and deceptive business marketing
9314340	9319340	promoting them have no place in the games being marketed the miners and
9319340	9324900	perhaps no place in games at all so they would one thing that they are thinking
9324900	9330220	about is maybe having some sort of you know official body that basically
9330220	9335260	legislates this type of thing but I don't know I watched a little video the
9335260	9339180	guy did that he put on YouTube it was it was it it's kind of interesting too
9339180	9342100	because you start to realize like oh these government people are around the
9342100	9345240	same age I am and they probably grew up on all the same video games I did and
9345240	9348220	now they you know have that type of influence to be able to do the
9348220	9353220	legislation but I I kind of sense that maybe they're just hoping to really push
9353220	9356940	the game industry to really regulate itself just like it did when the ESRB
9356940	9362100	happen they should and honestly like if they don't it's gonna get ugly if
9362100	9364700	you're gonna ruin it for everybody a is gonna fuck it up for everybody if they
9364700	9371020	don't want to be the first time but I kind of I kind of feel like I already
9371020	9373860	feel like and I know not everybody's gonna believe me I already feel like
9373860	9377820	there's a big chunk of the gaming industry that's kind of like message
9377820	9381460	received you all don't like these loot boxes and I think you're starting to see
9381460	9384780	people already distance themselves right you know I know people have
9384780	9388740	already done that and in fact actually the sales of Battlefront 2 have gone
9388740	9392060	down quite a bit so like the sales they were saying that right now that it
9392060	9396100	wasn't even meeting the same numbers that the 2015 Battlefront game did and
9396100	9399620	they're saying I think it's only 20% of expectation that they were selling with
9399620	9403420	that did we not I mean I just I have throw it out there do we not just hear
9403420	9406540	that a couple of Ubisoft games were being delayed like by like a month and
9406540	9411900	these little things well is this why no I don't know if that's why I don't think
9411900	9415740	because I know games take a long time to develop so like of course these loot
9415740	9419180	boxes have already been built into games that are still scheduled to be released
9419180	9423780	and so forth but you have every gaming company is talking about how the
9423780	9427180	internet responded to Battlefront 2 right now this everybody's talking about
9427180	9430540	blue boxes I don't remember if that game did or not did what that's the screen
9430540	9435500	game I can't remember if that had did or not I don't know I would need our
9435500	9439820	chatters to help me out over at live dot vog network comm I don't think so I
9439820	9446660	don't remember but um I it's just I mean I'm not surprised that this is happening
9446660	9451780	because look at they've been basically kind of inching the stuff up slowly as
9451780	9455780	over the years you know being introduced in scene kind of like okay can we get
9455780	9459140	way of this can we get away with this okay we got way of that like can we get
9459140	9465460	away this and it just has gotten worse and worse and worse and you know some
9465460	9470540	people kind of can overlook it at the games really good but in this case you
9470540	9474420	know even with Battlefront it was just kind of okay and then it just this was
9474420	9481020	such an ear-fearing thing that you can't tie you can't tie your leveling system
9481020	9485260	to loot boxes it's just not dungeon buster and chat says AC origins they
9485260	9488460	really did their best to keep the helix system off to the side and make any
9488460	9492180	everything attainable in the game Bobby Blackwell wants to point out Ubisoft
9492180	9495300	said the delay is the publisher is quote investing more time in the
9495340	9498900	development of these games this decision is in line with our strategic vision of
9498900	9503140	developing even more engaging and higher quality experiences for gamers okay I'm
9503140	9506260	sorry that's great that that's their official line that sounds like that is
9506260	9509460	total PR speak and smoke and mirrors they're not gonna come out and say and
9509460	9513660	again to be fair it could have we had loot boxes in there and they were shitty
9513660	9519060	but we're just gonna and it absolutely I made that up and I theorized it and it's
9519060	9523460	completely possible it has nothing to fucking do with loot boxes and maybe
9523500	9526740	there were just some last-minute bugs that reared their ugly head that need to
9526740	9530540	be squashed and they don't want to say we delayed it cuz oops we had some bugs
9530540	9533300	they're not gonna say that so of course we're gonna get these smokes mirrors but
9533300	9537780	I'm just saying it is interesting that is all you know and it's I can't help
9537780	9543340	but think hmm I would be soft or not there's got to be a lot of developers
9543340	9546940	with games about to come out in 2018 that maybe had the loot box system in it
9546940	9551220	where they're going maybe this isn't such a good idea because fucking Star
9551220	9556820	Wars fucking Star Wars just got crucified over maybe I shouldn't do it
9556820	9560700	because I've already paid you $60 for your fucking game no and how about you
9560700	9565180	treat me some fucking respect your own customer because now you're like oh yeah
9565180	9568380	I know you pay me $60 for the game but I need more money any more money money
9568380	9572580	money might give you give me give me give me give me fuck you I paid for your
9572580	9579140	game if you can't make that game work on $60 then don't develop that game quickly
9579180	9584540	what do you what do you ultimately think happens with loot box issue I think that
9584540	9588580	they scale it back a little bit and it comes right back or you know it's
9588580	9591940	possible that if legislation does go in place that they just drop them all
9591940	9594620	together kind like they did with the online pass that was a big thing
9594620	9598460	everybody was doing it even then like it was like oh yeah we need to fight use
9598460	9601820	game sales because that's really cutting into they make fucking excuse of
9601820	9605900	everything oh it's piracy that's cutting our that that's why we're losing all
9605900	9610260	this money it's because of piracy no way no it's game sales now oh wait no
9610260	9615620	it's because mobile games they make fucking excuses all time and in the end
9615620	9618420	it's like maybe it's just because your games just not that interesting people
9618420	9624660	don't want to buy it maybe that could be it um but like you'll date even with
9624660	9628980	that other system with the online pass they kind of like have skirting up oh
9628980	9633100	yeah we need to pay for those online servers because they're ongoing well
9633100	9636620	wait a second this game is an offline game why do you need an online pass for
9636620	9643100	that well we want money and then it's just like people just decided they want
9643100	9648940	to do it anymore here here's my prediction ESRB will be cornered to put
9648940	9652460	loot box into the rating basically a gambling if you have loot box you're
9652460	9656020	gonna get a gambling warning on your game I fully under I know the ESRB has
9656020	9659860	come out and said before that they don't see the problem loot boxes that was then
9659860	9663060	this is now I think ESRB is gonna be backed into corner they're gonna have
9663060	9667940	to do that and I think developers will need to they're gonna have to take the
9667940	9672380	quote-unquote China rule and publish the just have to save it for the loop or the
9672380	9676740	I'm not done they're gonna have to put in the percentages of what is in the
9676740	9680340	loot boxes that they're gonna have to be transparent with that and games are
9680340	9685860	gonna go up to ten more dollars in the next two years be ready for it well
9685860	9690060	here's the thing with the games going up ten dollars you know what fuck them they
9690060	9694780	already charged that kind of mine no I'm sorry and that's fine you are free
9694780	9698500	to choose what you want to buy what you buy and I'm gonna tell you gay when the
9698500	9702820	loot boxes go games gonna go up ten dollars two years and you know it's
9702820	9708620	gonna happen there's a 44 K is why and here's no and here's that's stupid too
9708620	9712120	but I just tell you here's what's gonna happen in those the loot boxes will
9712120	9715060	still be in there they'll raise them ten dollars and that shit will still be in
9715060	9719020	there because they want all of the money you give them some of the money and they
9719020	9722140	want all of the money that's what's gonna happen it's not because they need
9722140	9726800	the money they even said to their investors that pulling back the loot
9726800	9732540	boxes in Star Wars Battlefront was not gonna affect them monetarily all right
9732540	9737500	we'll see what happens moving on here's something a little more closer to home
9737500	9740460	which I think is interesting a little bit of Sacramento in the news actually
9740460	9745540	and this has to do with the Sacramento Kings they're a basketball team now they
9745540	9748100	don't usually make the playoffs you might not have heard of them before we
9748140	9751460	have a basketball it's in the NBA a little team called the Sacramento Kings
9751460	9755700	here in Sacramento and you may not know that they built a new arena a couple it
9755700	9759460	was very controversial here in the area but and I wasn't the biggest fan of it
9759460	9765860	either but I must admit it has really kind of pushed downtown to overall
9765860	9768900	transform you know there's a lot of new stuff that's down there and like things
9768900	9773060	to do down in the downtown area so we have this new you know arena that's
9773060	9776180	there well the reason why I bring all that up is because it was just announced
9776180	9781140	this week the Sacramento Kings put a new eSports training facility within that
9781140	9785100	arena which called the golden one Center gold ones Bank around here so they they
9785100	9789500	actually they have opened up an eSports training facility so they're calling it
9789500	9793580	a venue within a venue where there's a training facility broadcast center and
9793580	9797820	gamer lounge in that same area where the Kings basically do their games the
9797820	9802140	eSports venue will have fast connections lag free gaming theater style seating
9802140	9805940	for tournaments and events professional gamers that end up on the Kings eSports
9805940	9810540	team will be able to access the same stuff that NBA athletes get like the
9810540	9816780	food program and the oxygen bar that you know NBA players have access to the
9816780	9821580	eSports studios got 4k cameras green screens the whole thing is on the 4k
9821580	9826500	ultra HD broadcast center so that studio will end up being a massive backstage
9826500	9831900	area for musical acts as well with a ton of video games to play and a DJ rig for
9831900	9835020	musicians to mess around with so that's kind of interesting that they're
9835020	9838140	multitasking for when the bands come to town they could just play all the
9838140	9842500	fucking video games in the training center which I think is interesting so
9842500	9845140	that's kind of neat that that's happening in our backyard we'll just
9845140	9849180	we'll be sitting right here waiting for our invite to tour the facility as you
9849180	9852740	know we'll just we'll just be right over here guys hello well right you know when
9852740	9859420	when we were doing our stuff for work when I had to do the eSports thing that
9859420	9864500	we talked to the guys that were you know ahead of the marina there and yeah
9864500	9868140	eSports was a big consideration when they were designing the arena so mm-hmm
9868140	9871460	not surprised yeah no I think they even said that this was one of the things that
9871460	9879340	was coming was the whole 2k NBA thing mm-hmm we'll see all right moving on
9879340	9886620	dark Sakura well there's another game in the five nights at Freddy's franchise
9886620	9893580	and it's cute you design pizzas feed kids and get higher scores and it's
9893580	9899860	called Freddy fast pizza simulator shush you're ruining my spoilers but
9899860	9906940	that's not all it is some kind of spoilery quotes from people this game is
9906940	9911180	not what it claims to be do not be tricked by the screenshots and trailer
9911180	9918340	what just happened all you can do is play pizza simulator for free on steam
9918340	9925180	that's all you'll know and then tell us I'm glad it's free that's great
9925180	9930780	especially after the whole debacle with the RPG game this pizza has incomplete
9930780	9935780	choices for toppings because pineapple is not available it's not topping well
9935780	9939380	no wonder they were your whore mouth no wonder they want to murder everybody

9945460	9950020	news okay on the animal Animal Crossing pocket

9981460	9987940	kind of creepy though I'll just lock Ed in there welcome to dark soccer's camp
9987940	9993300	it's called glue factory all right moving on a couple more stories for you
9993300	9997980	guys that we're gonna get to Skype Loki so a new world record has been set for
9997980	10002520	Minecraft that's right speedrunning Minecraft just got faster because of a
10002520	10008160	new exploit where placing an end crystal right as you get to the end
10008160	10013160	allows you to actually skip the whole boss fight with the ender dragon and so
10013160	10019320	because of that now that the new record is actually a little bit faster so
10019320	10025760	record originally was four minutes seven seconds or and now the new run actually
10025760	10033560	stands at three minutes 20 seconds so not bad I'm sorry that was the previous
10033560	10036360	we're gonna yeah that's right that's gonna say I saw this a lot faster so
10036360	10042560	they did it in what was the time on this oh man I watched this earlier today I
10042560	10048360	think it was like a minute 40 or something this is pretty quick but see
10048360	10054240	they do it with like a set seed mm-hmm so let's see oh to cut it yeah make
10054640	10060320	standard I'm in at 35 is what it was SSG 100 Matt wants to know if Minecraft is
10060320	10064200	an AGD queue this year no but maybe this is something they could submit for a
10064200	10071160	future it would be really short it would be really short and SD owner Matt says I
10071160	10074300	just checked and nope yeah I figured that was the case they've had it in the
10074300	10078920	past and I watched it and I was bored because it's just I thought you know
10078920	10082920	when I thought it was like oh they're just gonna pick a random seed and go at
10082960	10087120	it and yeah quickly they can do it but it was like oh we have a set seed and I
10087120	10090840	just have to dig straight down to get to where I need to get and that I'm done
10090840	10095240	that's that's like hacking the game it's like yeah which to be fair is kind of
10095240	10098480	how they speed run some of this right here this is a tool assisted speed run
10098480	10106080	too so assisted I don't know all right well by the way we're gonna open up the
10106080	10109560	skype line it's available right now orange lounge radio all one word it's

10197720	10204480	weekend yes I was tell us about it how was did you did you go to the the little
10204480	10208840	Friday like kickback let's you know smoke weed and talk about PlayStation
10208840	10212440	event that they had on Friday or was no I didn't have them going I'm kind of
10212440	10217720	glad I didn't I don't blame you necessarily all right well how was the
10217720	10224440	show itself tell us a little bit about you know the the show itself sure well I
10224480	10231480	went actually last year too and I think this year's was better it's mostly
10231480	10236440	really it's really focused on indie games so they have you know who is
10236440	10240560	spread all over the place various games all types of genres you know they have
10240560	10246240	their Sony section but really it's total it's like probably 70 80 percent indie
10246240	10251040	or small games that are there really that's great yeah that's pretty cool
10251040	10254680	that's interesting that you say it's better than last year because most
10254680	10258560	people are probably looking at it going but the keynote was better last year so
10258560	10266240	what about it for you was better I just think they had a better setup like two
10266240	10273560	years ago or less whatever it was I went they their setup was really small sort
10273560	10280600	of like gamer X is Paul in the early years oh wow that you know even though
10280600	10284120	was in the same convention center the Anaheim Convention Center it was really
10284120	10290080	small and crowded so you you had a hard time getting around I think they planned
10290080	10296160	it out better the floor space there's more room between the rows really and I
10296160	10303400	think the game quality probably similar I just think they also brought a bunch
10303400	10311040	of stuff from e3 like not games they brought like the setup so they had like
10311040	10316440	Sega at e3 had like this sort of Tokyo hallway thing I don't know how to
10316440	10322720	explain it but they brought all the big stuff there to psx as well you know what
10322720	10326920	they didn't bring those fantasy star online too and I'm still salty about it
10326920	10336440	so just saying oh I wish we all wish but so it was more glitzy too I guess you
10336440	10340720	could say okay no that's good that's good you want to make when people are at
10340720	10343900	this Expo you want to make it feel luxurious because they spent a lot of
10343900	10347880	money to go I'm sure in PSX one of those cons like I keep meaning to go every
10347880	10350800	year but it's just this time of year is not always the best I but one of these
10350800	10354040	news dammit I'm gonna get there but let me ask this because you mentioned it was
10354040	10359360	so much indie game what's a game that caught your eye that you don't think
10359360	10365080	enough people are talking about that maybe they should be well my favorite
10365080	10371960	game that's coming up from the indie scene and it was sort of it's been
10371960	10375600	shown a little bit of other at other conventions maybe even packs but for me
10375600	10380640	it's donut County donut County yeah I think they showed a trailer for that
10380640	10389600	sometime recently but it's basically sort of like a katamari game except you
10389600	10394520	are a hole in the ground a small hole in the ground and it's sort of like you you
10394520	10398680	need to have objects fall into it and the more objects that fall in the larger
10398680	10403680	the hole becomes and then you can grab bigger things like houses and stuff like
10403680	10407800	that okay that sounds like more like that's weird they call it donut cuz I
10407800	10417720	think like black hole or something is what that sounds like yeah Florida don't
10417720	10424880	fall through the floor it uh okay it's really cute the art style you know
10424880	10430040	that's it's like a world of animals it's I think that's really good-looking game
10430040	10434360	and you can swallow them whole these cute animals and then they're like they
10434360	10438160	live underground from then on oh okay so it's a little happy ending that's
10438160	10443800	cute it reminds me of Animaniacs does it remember when they go down the hole
10443800	10452160	what's that tiny toons or was that animated that was tiny that was tiny
10452160	10463960	tunes cuz it was baby plucky elevator go down the whole okay so we just you know
10463960	10467120	took this game you're really excited about yeah it's 90s animation awesome
10467120	10471960	all right well MXC thank you for letting us know about your trip to a PSX I'm
10471960	10476080	kind of jealous you got to go you think you go back next year I might I mean I
10476080	10481160	wasn't even planning to go this year but my plan sort of got dashed because of
10481160	10487520	all the fires so right so I just say well I'll just go to PSX all right well
10487520	10491160	stay safe I don't know if that fire stuff is near you but say stay safe it's
10491160	10494920	not good thank you very much all right no problem take care you too right bye
10494920	10498600	bye orange lounge radio all one word on skype if you'd like to give us a call
10498600	10503440	to talk about anything that's on your mind or what have you we will leave that
10503440	10506600	open for just a little bit and then we'll probably move to wrap up here
10506600	10510680	before too long because it is already after nine o'clock here on the West
10510680	10513680	Coast which means midnight for you East coasters but we do have another call
10513680	10516880	coming in speaking of East coasters hi you're on orange lounge radio who's this
10516880	10521480	hey what's going on everybody it's Ron hey Ron mutts past your bedtime what's
10521480	10527280	up my friend what is this bedtime that you speak that's right it doesn't exist
10527280	10532840	anymore once you get to a certain point what's on your mind I'm on a system of
10532840	10536720	five hours of sleep that's all I need five hours of sleep and endless supply
10536720	10543040	of coffee at work I'm good I had to cut back on coffee because my heartbeat was
10543040	10548760	getting funky and so my doctor was like how much coffee do you drink and I told
10548760	10554280	her and she said maybe you want to stop drinking coffee no I was like okay sorry
10554280	10559960	let's hear that let's not talk crazy because that's not gonna happen I
10559960	10563840	actually laughed at her I said that's not gonna happen so she said let's try
10563840	10569240	cutting back on coffee okay that's that's more reasonable and as he did
10569240	10574280	fix it Mike problems on the way yeah yeah that works but um I wanted to
10574280	10581480	mention the main reason why I stopped playing Candy Crush is that I even with
10581480	10586560	the even with cheating the damn game I couldn't pass half the frickin levels I
10586560	10590160	was like nope done I can't do this anymore
10590160	10596720	how do you cheat Candy Crush all right a few years ago there was an add-on app if
10597080	10603200	your if your device was rooted it would edit your save game we could have an
10603200	10608200	unlimited amount of lives and power-ups and bonuses and I will go into the level
10608200	10617640	maxing out when I sat there at level 412 going through these power-ups and not
10617640	10622760	passing the stage I said you know what I believe I am done I'm going to find some
10622760	10628240	other games to play to kill time and then friends started telling about soda
10628240	10635880	saga about 15 levels in I said nope this ain't happening no I'm not getting caught
10635880	10640280	up in this again nope nope not gonna happen no I fell for this once I'm not
10640280	10648240	doing it again exactly God I wish that worked on me on me and MMOs but it's
10648240	10654600	just not going to everyone has their vice I guess what you've robbed MMOs is
10654600	10659520	your vice it is it's just always gonna be that so so there's like a little
10659520	10665480	syringe next to your bed that says ff14 on one one says wow you know you just
10665480	10669320	pick one that you want to tap the vein for that day then you have to get the
10669320	10673880	random shit like you got a bug up your ass to play the Old Republic today try
10673880	10677720	that so or elder screw well you met somebody who plays Elder Scrolls online
10677760	10684400	so you thought maybe this will be a good idea to play so yeah all right speaking
10684400	10687080	of old school I'm gonna say this one where they want to get out of here I
10687080	10694400	think right Enix may just be giving us rad racer 3 ooh why is that I was
10694400	10699640	playing around on the Google Play Store one day just exploring so I came across
10699640	10705960	a game title of a classic NES game that square put out that I would use to sit
10705960	10709560	there as a kid play the ever-loving daylights out of that's on the Play
10709560	10717160	Store do you remember a game called Kings night I do remember the name but
10717160	10720680	I'm having trouble remembering the gameplay in my head but of course now
10720680	10725000	I'm going to this good old-fashioned Google and looking it up it was like it
10725000	10729920	it's like a top-down shooter but not a shooter it was a top-down and you
10729920	10732800	controlled the character you're just throwing weapons and stuff like that
10733000	10737320	they're trying to save the princess he choose from four different characters
10737320	10742680	yeah yep I do remember this now yeah yeah they totally overhauled it and put
10742680	10750000	it out for mobile devices that's pretty rad and I have found myself there in the
10750000	10754940	company bathroom dark to see in chat says I heard about the sequel to that I
10754940	10758320	think it was a tie-in for Final Fantasy 15 it'll be an interesting way to
10758400	10763400	leverage an old product oh good lord that's Kings night by the way is the
10763400	10768640	name of that yeah so I'm like well this is good I wonder what the odds of them
10768640	10773280	bringing us rad racer I'm just saying hell we got puzzle fighter what more can
10773280	10779080	we ask for okay but can we talk about the puzzle fighter on the phone for a
10779080	10783920	minute because it's kind of crap no well we can but let me tell you me my sister
10784120	10789320	in the family she is the self-proclaimed puzzle fighter champion I've come close
10789320	10795120	to beating her but not yet today I show her the game and I'm like come get this
10795120	10798840	ass woman come get it come get it and she's like I can't play the game I'm
10798840	10803480	like why my phone can't handle it I look at her like that's supposed to be a you
10803480	10808000	problem though doesn't it I can't with the touch controls I just can't with the
10808000	10811720	touch controls and it's also just kind of it's kind of bootsy like I just
10811720	10815520	don't really care for it yeah I know it has all these cool new characters in it
10815520	10819920	but why don't you why don't you bring me something like on console where I can
10819920	10827160	use a controller or something well I mean well that's right I could bring a

10918640	10922760	get everybody's final thought for the night Dar soccer your final thought you
10922760	10929520	say that while I'm in the middle of typing sorry words that's it it's very
10929520	10935200	very deep very complex final thought Loki your final thought tonight my final
10935200	10941240	thought is aside from ready player one watching that trailer this weekend what
10941240	10946040	the fuck is up with the eyes and battle angel Alita I mean seriously did they
10946040	10951320	think putting anime eyes on a person was a good idea actually that wasn't a
10951320	10956720	tribute back to the manga so I was reading an interview about it so it
10956720	10961840	actually is a conscious choice to reflect the art style for the manga I'm
10961840	10964880	looking forward to it I really am because I've been waiting for a battle
10964880	10971400	angel movie for an age so I'm pretty excited about it and my final thought is
10971400	10974760	I would like very much to wake up tomorrow and not be sick anymore thank
10974760	10978640	you very much I'd appreciate it thank you guys for tuning in and supporting
