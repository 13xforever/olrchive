7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	20000	2017 we hardly knew you, well 2017 we bid you a fon, actually 2017 you're done.
20000	27000	O.L. Army, enjoy your new years plans, whatever they may be. May they be joyous, exciting, and most importantly, safe. See you in 2018.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	38000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio
38000	46000	Live today with episode number 712 for this December the 31st, the very last day of 2017.
46000	53000	My name is Rob Roberts. Not joining us live here yet today is DarkSakura or Jamie Sommers.
53000	59000	She'll be joining us over the telephone a little bit later on. But in studio we do have Techmaster Loki.
59000	63000	Hello. How are you Loki? I'm good. Happy New Year. Yes.
63000	70000	So real quick, just in case people forgot, we talked about this the last episode of the episode before, but we're actually live a little earlier today
70000	78000	where it's noon on New Years Eve and usually we do our show a little later at 6 o'clock, but for people's plans we figured, you know, let's do the show a little bit earlier today.
78000	88000	But usually we tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network, vog-network.com, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
88000	98000	And if you are listening live, even if you do happen to be here at noon, you maybe saw the tweet or something, you can join us in our chat room and we will be reading whatever comments are there.
98000	107000	Our next live show, the regular stuff, will be January 7th, 2018, New Year. Anyway, so that's a little bit of housekeeping there.
107000	114000	But how are you doing today, Master Loki? I'm fine. Yeah, so this is interesting since we have an earlier show today, you brought somebody else to the show.
114000	123000	Yeah, oddly enough he doesn't want to talk right now because he knew that you had a Switch and he wants to play the Switch.
123000	129000	That's fair, yeah. So yeah, I brought my son Josh. Yeah. And maybe he'll say hi later.
129000	134000	But right now he's too infatuated with Mario Odyssey, right? Yeah, he's too busy playing Mario Odyssey.
134000	143000	That's fine. That's understandable. Mario Odyssey is a pretty fun game. So anyway, we're going to get into some video game news here in a little bit.
143000	149000	I don't think it'll be as long of a show as usual, but we'll try to squeeze in what's been going on around the gaming world.
149000	155000	But there are some things like, you know, there's no video game releases going on right now. It's a little bit slower of a time of year.
156000	164000	I should go on over to our chat room, of course, over at live.vognetwork.com. ActDeft is in chat saying, Loki son, definitely.
164000	170000	I don't know if that's because shy, but you're not shy. No, I think because he's playing video games.
170000	173000	Playing video games, playing Mario Odyssey. He's busy at talk over video games.
173000	179000	Choosing to do video games over another activity. That maybe makes a little sense. I get it.
179000	184000	Alright, well, let's start at the top of the show here since it is New Year's Eve. It's the end of the year.
184000	191000	This is the time of year when people tend to talk about, oh, what are my New Year's resolutions?
191000	195000	For better or for worse. I know not everybody's into them, but I thought I'd ask anyway.
195000	200000	Is there anything that you are wanting to accomplish in gaming in 2018?
200000	205000	And I open that up to our chatters as well. Is there anything you want to accomplish in gaming in 2018, Loki?
205000	212000	I do want to rebuild my DDR pads. I keep bidding on DDR machines, but they never end cheap enough.
212000	220000	So I have now a full set of the acrylic panels from a DDR machine.
220000	226000	Is that nostalgia for Dance Dance Revolution? The reason why? Or is that like I want to have exercise gaming?
226000	236000	Well, yesterday I played laser tag in the first time in a while, and I'm sore after playing that.
236000	246000	I'm like, dude, that's nothing. That is low impact. I need to get my ass in shape now.
246000	253000	That wasn't a yeah of agreement. That was a yeah of I hear you, I understand you.
253000	261000	Yeah, it's just like just to be like, you know, I do, you know, before it gets worse because it's only going to get worse and get harder.
261000	269000	So it's like I didn't realize, like, oh, yeah, I can't do DDR anymore because that's that's too hard, you know, to do what I used to do.
269000	273000	But now it's like playing laser tag is like, wow, I'm that sore after playing laser tag.
273000	276000	OK, so one game of laser tag. Backtrack a little bit.
276000	280000	Yesterday you went and you took the kids to go play. Yes, I took them to play their first game of laser.
280000	285000	So walk us through that. So we went to Golf Land to play, you know, they want to play all the games there.
285000	291000	And I said, no, I said, you're going to go play laser tag. And so we did that and they had fun.
291000	296000	They you know, they got laser tag like toys for Christmas.
296000	301000	So they've been playing around with those, but they kind of like, you know, they're cheap and crappy.
301000	306000	So I was like, well, let's play with the actual laser equipment and go in the arena and actually play that and see all that.
306000	311000	So they liked it. All right. But they're my August son's still a bit little.
311000	318000	He's, you know, just about to turn four. And so he got upset because he he lost track of where I was a couple of times.
318000	322000	And so, you know, that made him upset. But, you know, he had fun.
322000	327000	And for the most part, he was shooting me. I'm like, you got to shoot the other team, not me.
327000	332000	Shoot the other team. I'm on your team. Is that something like repressed anger from.
332000	336000	No, it's just like it's funny. It's like it's I'm shooting you, daddy. Like whatever.
336000	340000	As long as he's having fun. I don't really care. So it was just all right.
340000	344000	I mean, but the laser type that they have at Golf Land Sunsplash.
344000	349000	I mean, granted, it's not Cuzar. It's it's really old like that.
349000	352000	I like I played on that. Ironically enough, I played on that.
352000	359000	Probably one of the first games that they ever had there because we actually got to do grad night at Golf Land before it opened to the public.
359000	364000	So I got to play laser tag there. Like one of their first games on brand new equipment.
364000	369000	And it was kind of crappy then. But now they're like really crappy.
369000	372000	They have these a system called Laser Runner, which is all right.
372000	375000	Like the new the packs that they have on their Web site now look really nice.
375000	380000	The packs that they're using now looks like someone took. But this place was built in what, like 97 or 98.
380000	383000	Yeah. It's like they haven't changed since then. Yeah.
383000	386000	It's just it's been the same equipment like the entire time.
386000	394000	So, I mean, it looks like that they took a laser gun sprayed spray foam all over the crap of that and wrapped it with electrical tape.
394000	397000	I mean, it's just like this big padded thing. All right.
397000	402000	So you did the laser tag and you your kids were shooting you and you were shooting the other team.
402000	407000	You did OK. But after it was done, you were just I was just a little bit.
407000	412000	Yeah, I wasn't really tired, but it's just like, oh, you know, my legs hurt from that.
412000	417000	Like it shouldn't hurt. Did you stretch first? I did not stretch first.
417000	422000	But like I totally would, you know, like if there's a Q's are nearby every weekend, I'd be there all the time.
422000	427000	Yeah. But it's just, you know, I don't know. It was fun.
427000	434000	But yeah, I do need I do want to build those pads just to utilize my arcade cabinet they have in the garage.
434000	439000	And, you know, I've been buying equipment for it. Like I've got the sheet metal sitting out in my shed.
439000	447000	It's been sitting there for years now. I've got the I bought the actual acrylic arcade arrows,
447000	454000	except three or four of them are like this custom printed stuff and it doesn't match.
454000	459000	But whatever. It's going it's just a thing you step on. So who cares?
459000	462000	It doesn't have to look good. It just doesn't have to look at it. It's acrylic.
462000	468000	Who cares of like the decal or the print on it is rubbing off or whatever. It doesn't matter.
468000	471000	So I thought you're putting this on YouTube or anything. Right. Exactly.
471000	478000	So like all I would need now is just the lumber for it and just hardware, I think, and should build it.
478000	482000	Now, will this be another project that you have finished where like you get the up and down arrow done,
482000	485000	but there's no left and right arrows? No, I would be able to get done.
485000	491000	Like I the last like I've built pads like several times and the last ones I had,
491000	494000	I had a problem with static electricity building up in them.
494000	499000	So it kept shorting out the controller board for it. So like it would work for two minutes
499000	503000	and they would just stop working until you shut the whole thing off and turn it back on again.
503000	506000	So now, you know, knowing more about that kind of stuff,
506000	512000	I can ground it properly and have, you know, bypass that issue. So I don't know.
512000	514000	All right. Well, I will hope to do that.
514000	516000	So whether I get around to it or not.
516000	519000	So constructing a new DDR exercise thing.
519000	524000	And of course, and of course, the other thing that I've been painfully aware of
524000	530000	and been more so lately now that I've run out of things to build is I got to work on my game again.
530000	531000	Yes, you do.
531000	535000	So that that's the other thing. It's been kind of in the front of my mind.
535000	541000	Yes, you do. For me, I think everything as far as like my resolutions or whatever you want to call it go,
541000	545000	probably go around live streaming because I was doing really well for a little bit.
545000	549000	You know, I got the affiliate status and then you guys all know I had a really bad year last year.
549000	551000	And I think it just kind of stopped.
551000	558000	And like it's just, you know, you kind of get in a place where it's like, I don't I don't know if I feel like being extroverted,
558000	562000	because I think when you're kind of doing the live stream stuff, you have to be a little bit extroverted.
562000	564000	Or at least I feel that you do.
564000	569000	I mean, I realize some people live stream like literally nothing but just video of them playing.
569000	571000	But I feel like you got to have a little more interaction.
571000	574000	So it takes it takes a little more extroversion or whatever.
574000	578000	So sometimes I just don't always feel it, but I miss it.
578000	582000	And I actually did a random live stream again this week, which was my first one in a month.
582000	588000	So that's something I kind of want to get back into, because I think I think I do have a lot of fun with the audience.
588000	592000	And especially like when it's things like Mario Kart and things you can play with the other people.
592000	595000	I think those are some of the best streams that were done.
595000	596000	So you haven't played?
596000	597000	I do.
597000	599000	No, I have not played that.
599000	607000	No, that is definitely on my agenda for things I want to do in the first couple of weeks of the year, because you speak so highly of it.
607000	609000	Oh, no, it's incredibly frustrating.
609000	610000	Yeah.
610000	615000	I guess otherwise it's just catch up on the good old games backlog of which I have quite a bit.
615000	622000	Oh, I should mention this as a little bit of a follow up to something I talked about six weeks ago or so.
622000	625000	I've allowed the Xbox back on the network.
625000	629000	Do you remember when my Xbox one used like 900 gigs of data or whatever it was?
629000	632000	By the way, I did I don't know if I ever mentioned this.
632000	635000	I did hear from somebody either Twitter or email.
635000	641000	I'm sorry, I forget who and where is a few weeks now, but somebody else reached out and said the same thing happened to them.
641000	642000	So it wasn't just me.
642000	644000	Thank you very much.
644000	647000	But I did feel like it was probably quantum break.
647000	649000	That was the culprit in that whole thing.
649000	650000	So what I did, I win it.
650000	651000	I just deleted quantum break.
651000	656000	I was like, if I want to play it again, I'll, you know, just redownload it at that point.
656000	660000	But right now I deleted it and no problems.
660000	662000	The Xbox has been online. It's been well behaved.
662000	668000	So it was definitely something about that particular patch that was downloading over and over.
668000	670000	It's just a 900 gigabyte patch.
670000	674000	I guess, I guess all that 4K for that 4K TV, I don't have.
674000	676000	No, I don't know if we'll ever know the solution.
676000	680000	4K, because that also happens to be how much your cable bill is that much.
681000	682000	Anyway.
682000	683000	All right.
683000	684000	Let's see.
684000	687000	Going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
687000	691000	Speaking of 4K, Bobby Blackwolf in our chat says,
691000	695000	My 2018 gaming resolution is hopefully going to be 4K.
695000	700000	Had the first two meetings with a local home theater installation company about a room in my basement.
700000	702000	Holy shit, that's taking it seriously.
702000	704000	Going to get professional installation.
704000	706000	That is, that is a man cave.
706000	708000	That is a supremo.
708000	714000	Although, even though I call it that, it's not like I know Bobby's fiance and she's going to be like,
714000	717000	Move, I want to watch Doctor Who in 4K.
717000	720000	So, even though I say that.
720000	721000	Let's see.
721000	722000	Dungeon Buster in chat says,
722000	727000	No huge resolution other than to hope for a better 2018.
727000	729000	Well, ain't that the truth?
729000	731000	I think there's a lot of us that are looking out for that.
732000	740000	This is the part of the year where I think a lot of your favorite shows would talk about their favorite game from the past year.
740000	743000	Their game of the year, if you will.
743000	747000	Their personal best game that came out in 2017.
747000	749000	Whatever your criteria is.
749000	752000	I'm kind of curious for you guys in chat what that game might be.
752000	754000	And, of course, I've got to ask Loki.
754000	756000	What would be your personal game of the year for 2017?
756000	758000	I haven't played a lot of games this year.
758000	760000	You kind of didn't, yet you still have this podcast.
760000	761000	Yeah.
761000	762000	So, you follow gaming culture.
762000	764000	Well, I bought a lot of games that I didn't play.
764000	765000	That's true.
765000	766000	You still buy the games.
766000	767000	I still buy the games.
767000	769000	I just didn't get around to them.
769000	771000	I don't know.
771000	776000	I'm trying to think back to all the things that came out of me.
779000	782000	I guess I didn't even play through Zelda, really.
782000	784000	So, I mean, that's kind of bad.
784000	790000	I'm sure that one of Zelda or Super Mario Odyssey would have been probably up there.
790000	791000	But I never played them.
791000	792000	Well, you don't have a Switch.
792000	793000	I don't have a Switch.
793000	795000	But I played enough of the kiosk.
795000	796000	And you got the Wii U.
796000	798000	You have the Wii U Zelda, right?
798000	799000	Yeah, we have the Wii U.
799000	800000	Zelda and Wii U.
800000	801000	So, I mean, that's alright.
801000	804000	What the hell did I play this year?
804000	805000	I don't even remember.
805000	809000	I probably want to play more Skyrim again.
809000	812000	No, I would say...
813000	814000	Let me think here.
814000	815000	So...
822000	824000	I didn't realize this would be such a hard question for you.
824000	825000	Yeah, I don't really...
825000	826000	I didn't play a whole...
826000	828000	I mean, nothing was really stand-out-ish to me.
828000	831000	I guess South Park, just because that's the last thing I played.
831000	834000	I mean, even that was kind of...
834000	836000	It wasn't as good as the last one, I thought.
836000	838000	I thought the first one was much better.
838000	841000	You know almost everybody out there is talking about what a great fucking year this was for gaming.
841000	843000	Just for the record.
843000	846000	There was a lot of strong games this year.
846000	850000	So I think at some point you got to catch up on some of these games, for sure.
850000	851000	Well, yeah.
851000	854000	I mean, there was a lot of great games that came out, but I didn't bother...
854000	858000	Well, because the first part of the year I was actually trying to work on my games.
858000	860000	So I did my things for that reason.
860000	863000	And then the latter half of the year is just like...
863000	864000	I don't know.
864000	867000	I'm too burnt out to play anything.
867000	871000	So even this fall, I picked up South Park.
871000	873000	I picked up the LEGO Marvel Super Heroes game.
873000	877000	The LEGO Marvel Super Heroes game was just a grind, so it wasn't even that good.
879000	882000	I don't know. I played a lot of VR in the beginning of the year.
885000	887000	I can't think of anything that really sticks out.
887000	888000	Alright.
888000	890000	For me, it's easy.
890000	894000	My game of the year for 2017 is Super Mario Odyssey, easily.
894000	902000	It kind of gets me to really enjoy 3D Mario games in a way I haven't.
902000	904000	I don't know if I have ever.
904000	910000	I was never as big on Mario 64 when it was first out as I think other people were.
910000	914000	Although I certainly recognize why it's such a great game and why people really like it.
914000	919000	And I think a lot of the best parts of that game really shine through again in Super Mario Odyssey.
919000	928000	The fact that Mario Odyssey is a game that's very simple in nature, yet there is so much to see and do.
928000	932000	And it's like they kind of took that script that worked very well in Zelda.
932000	936000	Although obviously all these games were in development for a long time, so it's not like they were copying off each other.
936000	941000	But I guess you see Nintendo in general taking this more open world approach.
941000	944000	And I think that worked really well in Mario Odyssey.
945000	952000	Which I suppose is not too dissimilar from how Mario 64 originally was, really.
952000	956000	But I think there's something about having the boat and traveling back and forth.
956000	963000	And the fact that you open up more after you beat the main story and so forth.
963000	971000	I kind of feel like it even gives it more of that sense of openness than I think I even felt when I did play Mario 64.
971000	978000	Even the minimal online components where you have some of the leaderboards with friends and so forth.
978000	984000	And just the variety of costumes and especially some of the way they handle the retro 8-bit stuff and all of that.
984000	989000	I think it just adds up to what was just a stellar gaming experience for me this year.
989000	992000	Mario Odyssey absolutely will be my game of the year.
992000	996000	Let me check and chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
997000	1005000	Let's see. Bobby Black Wolf in chat says most lists have Zelda, Mario, Cuphead, Resident Evil 7, Horizon Zero, Dawn.
1005000	1009000	Player Unknown Battlegrounds came out on the 20th so that counts.
1010000	1012000	Bobby also points out Persona 5.
1012000	1017000	Act F says I would put Cuphead as my top 5. Yeah, Cuphead was great.
1017000	1018000	Cuphead was a good game.
1018000	1028000	Cuphead was, especially the art direction and the way they really did transform that whole 1930s cartoon style into what is essentially a shoot-em-up game.
1028000	1036000	It's great. That game is a stellar experience so it's definitely worth checking out if you haven't yet.
1036000	1040000	Bobby in chat says I wasn't as big on Mario 64 either.
1040000	1044000	When Mario Odyssey got rid of the lives mechanic, that's what got me.
1045000	1050000	I'm fine losing 10 coins if I die. I'm not fine if I lose one of my last 3 lives.
1050000	1060000	Yeah, it is interesting how they changed that and I think since the game is more open, where do lives in that traditional sense,
1060000	1065000	going all the way back to the original Super Mario Brothers, where do lives fit in in that picture?
1065000	1067000	Where does the story begin and end?
1067000	1073000	Those lines are blurred a little bit so I think that's kind of why you have to get away from lives a little bit and look at instead
1073000	1077000	other ways to penalize the player if they die, which coins is a good mechanic.
1077000	1084000	It's also good too because a lot of the moons in the game that you have to get are very technical to get to certain places
1084000	1092000	and so it kind of allows you to challenge yourself to get to places because you know that the repercussion for failing is not that big.
1092000	1102000	So anyway, sorry, I was reading. So DarkSakura actually joined our chat room over at live.vognetware.com.
1102000	1108000	I'm not sure how much of this I want to say because I would like her to be here to talk through this at some point,
1108000	1115000	but you could probably guess what one of her top 3 games would be based on certain franchises.
1115000	1120000	I know! I was surprised too when she said Halo was her top franchise of the year.
1121000	1125000	You're just asking for a beating. You're asking for a beating.
1125000	1132000	Whereas, I understand it can't be the classic game of the week, but to make your 2017 top game of the year, I mean, that is just...
1132000	1136000	She's gonna come back. She's gonna show back up here and you're gonna be dead.
1136000	1141000	And then I'm gonna have to explain why Loki's missing all these shows in a row. That's gonna be what happens.
1141000	1148000	So anyway, I think I will wait for JB to come back and let her reveal those herself, which I don't know if she'll be back next week
1148000	1155000	or in a couple weeks, but we'll find out. Anyway, let's see, going to chat over at live.vognetware.com.
1155000	1162000	Now, something I will mention that JB's saying in chat, when Dan and I were first together, we kind of bonded over Mario 64 and Symphony of the Night.
1162000	1167000	Well, there's certainly always going to be some games, I think.
1167000	1173000	Obviously, I don't think there's anybody that's gonna dispute that Mario 64 and Symphony of the Night aren't really good games,
1174000	1181000	but I think there's always gonna be sentimental stuff. I think that you played maybe when you were younger or at a certain key time in your life,
1181000	1186000	and so maybe that's why you tend to like games maybe a little more than other people.
1186000	1192000	It kind of ties into what our pal Bobby has said on his show about Final Fantasy games for a long time,
1192000	1197000	that your favorite Final Fantasy game tends to be the one that was out when you were 12,
1197000	1205000	which, whether that exact science is true or not specifically for you, I think that age is tied to a lot of sentimental things,
1205000	1212000	so I think maybe those two kind of things are tied, is that you tend to, things that have a sentimental tie to them,
1212000	1215000	you're always gonna remember a little more fondly than other people.
1215000	1222000	And maybe, just maybe, y'all, when we talk about how we get in those, I call them fake arguments, I don't think they're real,
1222000	1226000	maybe they're real for you, I don't know, but when we talk about how Super Metroid, I believe, is the best game that was ever made,
1226000	1229000	yeah, there's probably some sentimental stuff that comes into that.
1229000	1234000	I played that game a lot in college when I didn't have a lot of other stuff going on,
1234000	1238000	so I think there's, you know, for me, maybe that's got some sentimental stuff in it.
1238000	1244000	And Bobby already, you know, early announcing that his game of 2018 is gonna be Ni No Kuni 2.
1244000	1248000	Very courageous, all these like big, you know, announcements today.
1248000	1249000	That's a big, that's hedging a big bet.
1249000	1250000	It's just crazy.
1250000	1252000	That game might get delayed again, we'll see.
1253000	1263000	Let's see, VOG 338, somebody going a little anonymous in our chat, saying Mario Kart was my game.
1263000	1268000	So, yeah, well, you know, some people, I don't know if that's Mario Kart in the past, like a sentimental game,
1268000	1274000	or Mario Kart 8 on Switch was game of the year, because some people didn't discover it till this year,
1274000	1276000	because not everybody bought the Wii U.
1276000	1283000	Did you see that news story this week about how the Switch lifetime sales in Japan have already exceeded Wii U's lifetime sales?
1283000	1285000	In just the less than a year it's been out.
1285000	1286000	Yeah, I believe it.
1286000	1288000	Yeah, I believe it too, but it's, you know.
1288000	1295000	Which is still surprising, which we'll get to later, that certain things aren't implemented or done yet, Nintendo.
1295000	1296000	Come on.
1296000	1299000	Well, maybe we'll find a little more about that as we continue on with the show.
1299000	1303000	So, ActDeft also pointing out another game that I hear a lot about.
1303000	1305000	Sonic Mania is definitely great.
1305000	1309000	DungeonBuster also saying Sonic Mania was so good in SSA 100M.
1309000	1312000	Sonic Mania is in my top three game of the year.
1312000	1316000	Yeah, I think a lot of people are very pleased with what happened with Sonic, for sure.
1318000	1323000	Okay, let's talk a little more current and talk about our gaming weeks,
1323000	1325000	and then we'll get into some of the news that happened this week.
1325000	1329000	Loki, I don't know, I mean, you already kind of mentioned you've been a little slower on the games this year,
1329000	1332000	but did you get to play any games this week? How was your gaming week?
1332000	1335000	I didn't play any VR games, unfortunately.
1335000	1341000	I did finish South Park, The Fractured But Whole, and then I started going into DLC stuff.
1341000	1349000	But, you know, having played The Sick of Truth, I think that was a better story than The Fractured But Whole.
1349000	1357000	The Fractured But Whole is funny, but at the end it just kind of seemed very rushed and just kind of like,
1357000	1362000	I don't know. It was alright. It just wasn't as hilarious.
1362000	1370000	Because the whole Sick of Truth was more of the kids playing this role-playing game type thing,
1370000	1373000	and this other thing going on in the background that was ridiculous.
1373000	1379000	And then this one was more about superheroes, and the thing that's ridiculous going on in the background
1379000	1383000	is heavily involved in what they're doing.
1383000	1389000	So it wasn't kind of like they're oblivious to this whole thing, or people are oblivious to what's going on.
1389000	1396000	It's just, I don't know, it was ridiculous. But just not as funny as the first game.
1396000	1401000	And then the DLC that I'm playing right now is kind of like this Danger Room thing, so it's just these really hard battles.
1401000	1405000	And it's just like a grind. There's not really any point to doing it other than,
1405000	1408000	oh, I beat this on really hard difficulty.
1408000	1414000	I didn't even play that game on hard difficulty, because all it does is give the AI more...
1414000	1420000	It makes the battles longer, and I don't really want to sit there fighting all the time for a very long time
1420000	1426000	about the story to progress. But at least the Danger Room stuff, you have to play it on the highest difficulty.
1426000	1432000	It wasn't that difficult, it just took longer. I don't know.
1432000	1436000	It's alright, though. I like the game. I recommend it, but it's just...
1436000	1442000	If you're going into it thinking, the combat system's pretty good, but I think the story in the first game was better.
1442000	1444000	Alright.
1444000	1448000	And then, as far as other games, I played more Pokémon Go and actually a little bit of Ingress,
1448000	1452000	because we can go in different parks, so I hit whatever portals are nearby.
1452000	1454000	New stuff. Here you go.
1454000	1460000	Yeah, new stuff. But I'm gonna try to get into more things again next year.
1460000	1461000	Okay.
1462000	1470000	To register participation with this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, smile.
1470000	1476000	Mike Gaming Week. Well, I mean, I didn't play a lot of new stuff that I can think of this week.
1476000	1482000	It was mostly revisiting, especially a lot of Blizzard stuff, because I've still been playing a little World of Warcraft here and there,
1482000	1488000	although I did also play Final Fantasy XIV. See, I am kind of juggling both MMOs, because I went and I got that bear mount for Christmas.
1488000	1494000	This is super adorable. You ride this little bear and you throw presents at people. It's really cute, so I like that.
1494000	1499000	And then I was playing Heroes of the Storm, which I've been playing off and on for a few months now.
1499000	1506000	And then I finally played Overwatch, which I was actually streaming a little bit, and then there were some that I didn't stream.
1506000	1510000	I was actually playing some Overwatch this week, so I was kind of getting back into that.
1510000	1515000	And again, it's this masterful thing that Blizzard has done through games like Heroes of the Storm.
1515000	1519000	I start playing it going, and this is what kind of got me back in a while. I was like,
1519000	1524000	oh, playing Malfurion in Heroes of the Storm is kind of fun. I miss the Druid healing stuff, so I go play that.
1524000	1531000	And now it's with Heroes of the Storm, it's like, oh, playing Lucio and Junkrat is kind of fun, and I should go play Overwatch again.
1531000	1537000	So god damn you, Blizzard, for finding a really good formula that kind of works with all your properties.
1537000	1542000	I guess I've just been lucky that I haven't been sucked into the whole Blizzard thing, because I tried Overwatch and I just never got into it.
1542000	1548000	I tried it, and I bought it, and... no. Just not interesting.
1548000	1554000	See, it's controversial what I'm going to say, but I don't know if maybe the experience is different on console versus PC.
1554000	1557000	But then again, I know some people that swear by consoles and they love it.
1557000	1558000	I play on PC.
1558000	1560000	Oh, gee, I thought you played on console.
1560000	1562000	I play with a controller on PC.
1562000	1564000	Okay, now that's just weird.
1564000	1568000	Well, I have a touchpad. I can't play keyboard mouse with a touchpad.
1569000	1576000	I have a mouse, but I don't have any place to put a mouse on a couch, so I play with a controller.
1576000	1583000	I mean, it's fine, I like a controller, but it's not that I keep dying or anything, it's just that I just don't find the game interesting.
1583000	1589000	Let's see, going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Valagas in chat says,
1589000	1593000	I'm with Loki on Overwatch, yet Act F says, I love Overwatch.
1593000	1595000	Well, a lot of people love Overwatch.
1595000	1597000	I'm not knocking it, it's a great game.
1597000	1600000	It's just, I can't get into it for some reason. I don't know.
1600000	1609000	TigerKlaue in chat says, I guess you could say 2017 was Overwatch's year, so much so they managed to get themselves featured in the upcoming Ready Player One movie for next year.
1609000	1612000	Yeah, I mean, see, that's the thing.
1612000	1616000	Like, Ready Player One, I'm ultra hyped for that.
1616000	1620000	That, I used to have, like, I used to be that way with games, too.
1620000	1623000	Like, certain games would be like, oh my god, I can't fucking wait to play that game.
1623000	1624000	Right.
1624000	1627000	You know, but it's just, not feeling it now.
1627000	1632000	Red Dead Redemption 2, maybe? But I'm not even, like, I'm kind of cooling down to that game.
1632000	1636000	What is it? Is that, is that just, you know that you don't have the same time that you used to?
1636000	1639000	Or is that this whole stuff that's happening with loot boxes?
1639000	1642000	Well, it's just, I know that they're going to have a big online portion.
1642000	1648000	Red Dead Redemption, I never was into it as much as Grand Theft Auto, but it was a great game.
1648000	1654000	I just never finished it, or as I finished all the Grand Theft Auto games.
1654000	1661000	But, I don't know, I just, like, if they announced a Grand Theft Auto 6, I'd be pretty hyped for that.
1661000	1669000	It's just now, though, like, I'm a little disappointed that they didn't do any single player DLC for Grand Theft Auto 5.
1669000	1674000	Because they had, like, planned some nice stuff, but then they made too much money online, and they're like, ah, forget that.
1674000	1677000	We're just going to put all our resources in the online, which is fine. Online's pretty good.
1677000	1683000	Apparently, and there's a lot to do now, but I just haven't, I've been so out of it for a long time that, I don't know.
1684000	1685000	Alright.
1685000	1696000	Well, you know, I think with Overwatch, I think there's a lot of people that, you know, are still, or at least I'm kind of getting the sense, you know, reading blogs and people's personal game of the year and Twitter and stuff.
1696000	1700000	There's some people that are saying, you know, Overwatch was kind of my game of the year this year, too.
1700000	1708000	It's the game that I just play a lot of because they add maps, they add characters, they do different things in the competitive seasons.
1708000	1711000	They kind of, you know, kind of keep people engaged with Overwatch.
1711000	1715000	So for some people, it was kind of their game of the year 2017 and 2016.
1715000	1725000	That's just the interesting thing about the gaming world we live in now, how games metamorphosize and change through patches and either pay expansions or not pay expansions.
1725000	1726000	Yeah.
1726000	1733000	So, you know, in many ways, I would say Final Fantasy XIV Stormblood, that expansion was one of the better things that was released this year.
1733000	1735000	But where does that kind of fit in, you know?
1735000	1743000	Yeah. And then, like, also in a lot of the games I was looking forward to in the fourth quarter this year were ruined by microtransactions and stuff.
1743000	1745000	Like, I was looking forward to the new Battlefront game.
1745000	1755000	Like, it looked cool because, like, oh, hey, you know, the fact that you're playing, you know, the bad guy, which apparently, spoiler, you turned to the light side, like, immediately.
1756000	1762000	I mean, it would have been better if you stayed on as the villain and that, like, that's more interesting.
1762000	1763000	Yeah.
1763000	1766000	You know, but no, we didn't do that.
1766000	1771000	And then they ruined all of it with just, like, shoving this microtransaction stuff down your throat.
1771000	1779000	What? I still kind of think that, I think because of all this vast negativity and some of the things we're going to get into here at the top of the show, I think loot boxes are done for.
1779000	1783000	I know you kind of still think that there's companies, maybe in free-to-play games they'll still be there.
1783000	1784000	No.
1784000	1786000	I think they're done for. I really do.
1786000	1788000	They're not. I don't think so at all.
1788000	1789000	We'll see.
1789000	1790000	I think they're going to still do this.
1790000	1791000	We'll see.
1791000	1792000	It's going to get worse.
1792000	1794000	That's going to be something for the time capsule for next year.
1794000	1795000	That will be for the time capsule.
1795000	1797000	Which, by the way, some of you might be asking, why aren't you opening the time capsule tonight?
1797000	1801000	We want to do it when we're live at our normal time so we have, you know, our usual turnout here.
1801000	1804000	And we would like Jamie to be here so that we can all kind of do it together.
1804000	1806000	So, we'll do that at our first show back.
1806000	1807000	Yeah.
1807000	1811000	But I will say, oh, I guess a little bit of housekeeping because we're going to get into housekeeping here.
1811000	1814000	I am going to try to get more guests on the show in 2020.
1814000	1817000	I know I always say that and then we'll get a bunch of guests and then it kind of fizzles out.
1817000	1821000	But certainly if you know somebody who's developing a game or somebody that wants to come promote, you know...
1821000	1823000	Should we try to do another game jam?
1823000	1825000	And this time actually go through with it?
1825000	1827000	No.
1827000	1831000	I would want to make sure it's defined a little better than it was last time.
1831000	1833000	So, we can talk about that.
1834000	1838000	But as far... and that's not a knock. It's just more like definition for like...
1838000	1843000	So that I don't feel like I'm holding the whole thing up by, you know, not participating in certain ways.
1843000	1844000	So, I just kind of want to...
1844000	1847000	Well, how can we better quantify our role in that whole thing? That's all.
1847000	1848000	Anyway.
1848000	1850000	Shoot. Now you can...
1850000	1852000	There was only one entry that was never submitted.
1852000	1855000	Yeah. Yeah.
1855000	1858000	To be fair, I said I tried to do something too and it was just...
1858000	1860000	I did try to go in Unity and learn.
1860000	1862000	I probably learned more about Unity than I knew before because of it.
1862000	1865000	So, I would say little accomplishment. Nothing else.
1865000	1867000	But anyway.
1867000	1869000	I did finish one thing this year.
1869000	1872000	I mean, it was a project for work.
1872000	1876000	But it technically was a built thing.
1876000	1879000	It was a tech demo and it was finished.
1879000	1882000	So, it's one thing that's somewhat finished.
1882000	1885000	There you go. Grasp the straws where you can.
1885000	1886000	I'll take that.
1886000	1892000	Anyway, I will say you can look forward to January 14th here on the show.
1892000	1895000	That is when I'm planning the Ladies of Ingress night.
1895000	1896000	So, that'll be fun.
1896000	1897000	Hooray!
1897000	1898000	That'll be fun.
1898000	1901000	So, if you don't know much about that game, even though we talk about it once in a while,
1901000	1903000	we're gonna have a lot to talk about that night.
1903000	1904000	So, that should be fun.
1904000	1908000	And the gals that'll be here are really funny.
1908000	1910000	So, it's gonna be a fun show.
1910000	1912000	Even if you don't play that game and you don't really give a hoot about it,
1912000	1914000	I think you'll have a good time.
1914000	1916000	Did you find Pepper or anything?
1916000	1918000	We couldn't gain one on the blue side?
1918000	1920000	There's too many green people that want to come.
1920000	1923000	It's gonna be as fair and balanced as Fox News that night.
1923000	1924000	That's all I can say.
1924000	1926000	Well, here's my thing.
1926000	1930000	I don't want to talk about stupid drama, faction war stuff.
1930000	1933000	I don't want to talk about that other stuff.
1933000	1938000	This show is really highbrow and so I'm trying not to bring it down with that other stuff.
1938000	1939000	So, yeah.
1939000	1943000	We're gonna just keep it focused on accomplishments and positives and all that good stuff.
1943000	1944000	Alright, anyway.
1947000	1948000	Where was I?
1948000	1949000	Oh, yes.
1949000	1951000	We're gonna get into...
1951000	1956000	Oh, I guess as far as other housekeeping goes, there's no shows off that I know of coming up.
1956000	1959000	We should be here pretty regularly on Sunday nights.
1959000	1964000	I don't even have any conventions scheduled until August, really, at this point.
1964000	1965000	So, I don't know.
1965000	1967000	I don't know if I'll be doing anything early next year.
1967000	1968000	We'll kind of see.
1968000	1970000	I'm not doing Nightfest, sadly.
1970000	1971000	Oh, yeah.
1971000	1972000	The indie arcade will be in April.
1972000	1973000	So, there'll be that.
1973000	1974000	Hopefully.
1974000	1976000	I mean, I haven't had confirmation on that, but I'm pretty sure it's gonna happen.
1976000	1977000	So, that'll be good.
1977000	1980000	Oh, and Bobby says March 25th.
1980000	1982000	That's not a gaming convention.
1982000	1983000	Oh, right.
1983000	1985000	But I'm gonna be out of town that Sunday anyway.
1985000	1986000	You're right.
1986000	1987000	Okay, so that's...
1987000	1988000	Yeah.
1988000	1992000	The end of March will be a show that will be missing for not a convention reason, but
1992000	1993000	personal reasons.
1993000	1994000	Yeah.
1994000	1995000	Alright.
1995000	1998000	Anyway, in the meantime, let's get into some gaming news, talk about what's going on in
1998000	1999000	the gaming world.
1999000	2000000	Okay.
2000000	2002000	So, let's start off with an extremely positive story.
2002000	2003000	Okay, just kidding.
2003000	2006000	It's not extremely positive because it's 2017.
2006000	2011000	So, you may be familiar with swatting the whole thing where if you don't like what someone's
2011000	2017000	doing, you call in a fake police report and the swat arrives at their house and scares
2017000	2018000	them.
2018000	2021000	Oh, it's so hilarious, isn't it?
2021000	2026000	So, apparently there was a couple people that were involved with a Call of Duty match where
2026000	2031000	they had a bet of $1.50 running on the match and apparently they lost.
2031000	2036000	And there were words had between them and they started arguing.
2036000	2041000	And so, apparently the one guy threatened to swat the other guy and so he got this guy
2041000	2046000	by the name of Swatastic to swat him.
2046000	2055000	And the player, I guess Miracle, he had taunted the Swatastic guy because he was trying to
2055000	2057000	dox him to get his address.
2057000	2060000	And so, he said, well, here's my address, come swat me.
2060000	2063000	You're just going to get jail time if you do that.
2063000	2064000	And so, he did.
2064000	2067000	He swatted him and come to find out it wasn't his address.
2067000	2068000	And so, what happened?
2068000	2071000	Well, the police arrived.
2071000	2080000	The guy that was at the house heard a commotion outside, opened the door and was shot to death.
2080000	2083000	And so, now he's dead.
2083000	2085000	His children don't have a dad anymore.
2085000	2090000	And this guy basically thought he got away with it.
2090000	2096000	Well, then he went on to Drama Alert, a YouTube channel, and bragged about what he did and stuff.
2096000	2102000	And then, finally, the LAPD did catch him and so now he's under arrest.
2105000	2108000	So, I hate that this story is tied to video gaming.
2109000	2113000	No offense, I realize it's something a lot of blogs and people are talking about.
2113000	2118000	And that's what we bring to the table each week, even if it's not, hooray, a new game being released.
2118000	2125000	But it really sounds like this whole video game thing is completely secondary to the other issues going on here.
2125000	2127000	Because it could have been $1.50 on a sports game.
2127000	2133000	It could have been $1.50 on a You Got Served dance battle.
2133000	2136000	There's a whole lot of people to blame here.
2136000	2142000	I mean, first off, this guy brags about swatting MLG events and stuff like that.
2142000	2147000	He thinks it's funny to have people evacuate buildings and watch it on TV.
2147000	2150000	Well, what a bunch of, and I hope your kid isn't listening so say this quietly,
2150000	2154000	but what a bunch of fucking assholes just being fucking assholes.
2154000	2158000	That's what this is. This is just a story about assholes being assholes.
2158000	2164000	And it's horrible. It's horrible what's happened that an innocent person basically got killed in this whole thing.
2164000	2167000	These are grown adults that are doing this kind of stuff.
2167000	2172000	And I don't think anybody in our audience really does this or is into this or whatever,
2172000	2177000	but my plea would be to anybody out there is don't watch these YouTubes.
2177000	2184000	Don't support these things. Call people out when they're being stupid about this swatting stuff because look at what happened.
2184000	2190000	And the guy wasn't even involved in it. The guy that got killed is a complete innocent bystander.
2190000	2195000	And it's not like this is the first time swatting has happened. We've seen this stupid stuff happen on Twitch
2195000	2200000	and throughout all the drama that's happened in gaming in the past couple years and so forth.
2200000	2205000	It's not like this is the first time. But unfortunately, I think a lot of people said at that time,
2205000	2209000	what's it going to take for people to take this seriously? Is somebody going to have to die?
2209000	2214000	Well, here we are. We've reached that point because nobody took it seriously before.
2214000	2222000	And now it sucks. And I'm sorry to be so bleh about it, but that's the reality is here we are.
2222000	2229000	You know, thank God this guy is in jail. You know, he should be spanked publicly.
2229000	2235000	Naughty, naughty, naughty. Actually, more than that. But anyway, I'll leave that to the...
2235000	2241000	The guy that called it in was 25 years old. It's like a grown adult.
2241000	2245000	It's just I don't understand how these people are out there.
2245000	2249000	You know, and his like he was, you know, like I said on Twitter, he was kind of saying, you know,
2249000	2254000	I didn't get anyone killed because I didn't discharge a weapon and being a SWAT member isn't my profession.
2254000	2259000	And yeah, the police, I think, are a little bit to blame here. Well, they're definitely to blame here, too,
2259000	2265000	because what did you expect was going to happen? You're making a commotion outside, you know,
2265000	2270000	and the guy opens the door unarmed to see what's going on and you immediately shoot him.
2270000	2276000	You don't say, hey, get down on the ground or anything like that. It's just that open fire.
2276000	2279000	A whole nother issue, I think, that needs to be explored, too.
2279000	2284000	But much bigger than what this show can get into, you know, that type of thing.
2284000	2289000	But obviously there's just a lot of like stuff in the story where it's like this all sucks.
2289000	2296000	All of it. It sucks. And as in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com,
2296000	2300000	Valagis in chat says we gamers get trashed again because of an a-hole.
2300000	2305000	Yeah. And that's what it is. And that's unfortunately why we have to bring it up on this show.
2305000	2310000	But I think it's an opportunity for us to kind of say, OK, this ain't funny.
2310000	2315000	And I'm going to let other people know it's not funny and I'm not going to follow it and I'm not going to support it.
2315000	2319000	And that's kind of what MXC in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says.
2319000	2327000	This is disgusting. And I'm glad I don't understand why or I'm glad I don't understand why anyone finds it humorous to do this stuff.
2327000	2332000	It's not. They had a was an interview with the I don't know who it was.
2332000	2336000	It was like the the wife or the sister or something like that, basically.
2336000	2343000	So after they because they called him basically that he was in a hostage situation, is holding his family hostage.
2343000	2346000	And he was I don't know if he had killed somebody or something like that.
2346000	2351000	So basically they took down who they thought was the hostage taker.
2351000	2359000	And then they made they arrested the hostages as well and had them walk over their dead dad, like step over their dead dad.
2359000	2369000	And as they brought him outside, it was like like kids. Like it just the whole thing sounds like it was handled terribly.
2369000	2378000	I don't know. I mean, I understand, though, that a lot of law enforcement has to take some of this stuff seriously, because what if it was a serious situation?
2378000	2381000	Right. You don't want to, you know, the boy who cried wolf, that type of situation.
2381000	2383000	Well, you don't want to shoot first, ask questions later.
2383000	2385000	I definitely agree with that element of that.
2385000	2393000	Because how many times have we had problems with that or just over, you know, an excessive force being used in situations?
2393000	2401000	Yeah. Anyway. All right. That's it. I don't want to talk about stupid people doing horrible, horrible things any longer.
2401000	2407000	Let's move on to something that actually really does impact gaming. And this could be setting an interesting tone for 2018.
2407000	2415000	And it's a new rule out of Apple. Apple and this kind of quietly. I say quietly because, well, I mean, obviously blogs are picking up on it.
2415000	2420000	But that kind of happened in that slower holiday period. And so I'm not sure everybody's really picked up that this has happened.
2420000	2429000	But Apple has put a new guideline for games coming to the App Store. And this is targeting, I suppose, microtransaction.
2429000	2442000	As part of the new policy, which you can see on Apple's website, Apple will now require games on the App Store that features microtransactions and loot boxes to disclose the possibility of winning a certain loot or item.
2442000	2447000	Where we've heard this before, which was the big China law that some people have been talking about.
2447000	2449000	Good. I think it's a great thing that they're doing.
2449000	2467000	Yeah. So anyway, the rule specifically states in the guidelines for App Store approvals, quote, apps offering loot boxes or other mechanisms that provide randomized virtual items for purchase must disclose the odds of receiving each type of item to customers prior to purchase.
2467000	2478000	So does that mean that they have to disclose it like an end user license agreement or like when I go to purchase that loot box that says it pops up a screen showing me the odds of everything?
2478000	2489000	That's a really good question. And unfortunately, I don't think it's really clear. It's not clear here. So we'll have to see what kind of happens from what Apple starts accepting from what they don't start accepting.
2489000	2502000	Now, this same policy doesn't show up on the Google Play Store. But since most people kind of have to do their apps for both these days, right, if you really want to get everybody, you got to do Apple and Google, although some things get away with it.
2502000	2509000	Like HQ still is on Android, right? That game's a big frickin' deal. And it's still not an Android, right? Or it's going to be soon? I don't know.
2509000	2518000	And then some things, you know, like with Mario Run came out on iOS first and then with the Fire Emblem thing was out on Android first. You know, some things, but eventually they're kind of out for both.
2518000	2530000	But my point is, is that even though Google doesn't have this rule, like it's probably going to start showing up even if you have an Android device just because programmers are just going to make the same game for both.
2530000	2546000	Well, no, not necessarily. I don't think that they'd volunteer that information. I think that they'll only show it if they have to. What I could see them implementing that is if they start having more pressure from like the ESA is going to really put any pressure on them.
2546000	2559000	But it's like, you know, this whole movement right now with government where they're trying to, I think, put out a Senate bill or something like that saying, hey, we need to crack down on these loot boxes because there's several states now led by Hawaii.
2559000	2562000	I thought Hawaii was doing that in Hawaii.
2562000	2578000	No, there's other congressmen that are actually working on it as well. Or at least they have support by other states. So it may start in Hawaii and then may move on. So who knows?
2578000	2583000	That's another reason why I'm thinking loot boxes are kind of done, but we'll see.
2583000	2585000	We'll find a way around it.
2586000	2598000	Anyway, over in chat, over at live.vognetwork.com, actf says that's a good rule. Dungeon Buster says if you have to start somewhere with self-regulating loot boxes, one could say Apple is as good and as big a proponent as any.
2598000	2611000	So that's another interesting angle is that is Apple doing this to quote unquote self-regulate to stop maybe a lot of this talk about Hawaii, et cetera, getting in on a movement to regulate something?
2611000	2615000	Maybe. I think that could be a huge part of it, too.
2615000	2626000	Well, interesting. It'll be interesting to see how this could affect games in 2018. We haven't really seen the results of this yet because then Apple kind of went in that dark approval, which is normal.
2626000	2637000	Between Christmas and New Year, there's not really a lot of approvals getting through. But I think as we get into January, I'm assuming that if games want to do updates, they're going to have to conform to this, right?
2637000	2647000	I mean, maybe the games that are already out there are going to stay out there, but now games as they update are going to have to implement this. So it's going to be interesting to see how that changes things in 2018.
2647000	2650000	We'll see. All right, moving on. Next story, Loki.
2650000	2663000	So you remember that whole kind of Easter egg that they had in the Switch operating system that hid the game Golf, the NES game Golf in there?
2663000	2665000	It was the tribute to Iwata, right?
2665000	2681000	Yes, the tribute to Iwata. Well, apparently they are removing it. So according to hackers, data miners, I should say, the Switch update 4.0 takes the Flog code that was in there, removes all of it and the executable and overrides it with garbage data.
2682000	2699000	So that's kind of unfortunate. So I don't know what the point of that is. Why? Was it because they didn't know that was in there? It was like some coder hid that in there and they didn't like it? I mean, that's kind of lame. I don't know what the point would be behind that.
2699000	2713000	Yeah, I'm not sure why. Maybe they got frustrated at how much this was taking off when it was supposed to be kind of like a hidden tribute type of thing. Or maybe they realized they could charge for this. I don't know. That's what the cynical side, I think, says a lot of people.
2713000	2717000	It's golf. Come on. We're missing out on that $10.
2719000	2733000	The golf on the NES was, you know, it's not a game that aged gracefully. Back in the day, you know, it was golf. It was about as good as you could get, but it hasn't aged gracefully compared to a lot of stuff today.
2733000	2756000	That's like removing nibbles or gorillas from, you know, Q Basic 5 and DOS or something like that. It's like, they're shitty. It's a shitty game that's super old that, who cares? You've made your money. You've made your money on that. I hope it's not financially motivated because if it is, that's super lame.
2756000	2769000	So Bobby in Chat is saying that it was supposed to be a blessing never to be unopened. It's part of the Japanese custom, and it's not about money or anything like that. It was kind of supposed to be removed because the data miners opened it.
2769000	2778000	So basically, it was intended to be hidden the whole time, and because it got opened, it's like Pandora's box got unleashed or whatever.
2778000	2781000	Then don't make a way to activate it. That's so dumb.
2781000	2796000	Well, Loki, I kind of get it. I actually kind of get it. It was a hidden secret thing. But here's the thing. At the end of the day, this is what I will agree with. At the end of the day, okay, they buried this thing and they made it very hard to get to because it was supposed to be a blessing and all that stuff.
2796000	2808000	But at the end of the day, somebody forgot that rule, and that is hackers gonna hack. Right? So of course somebody was gonna find this eventually. So, you know, that's the whole thing.
2809000	2821000	I understand why maybe it was supposed to be the secret thing that wasn't supposed to get out, and then when it got out, it became about, ooh, hidden game, and not about, it's a tribute, actually, type of thing.
2821000	2823000	Don't mod it and put it back in there.
2823000	2829000	Yeah, that's interesting. You say that tongue in cheek, but I bet you people will.
2830000	2842000	There was, and I was seeing some of the chat on Discord. I didn't put it in our, which by the way, just a plug for our VOG Network Discord if you're not there. It's a lot of fun conversations like this one, vognetwork.com slash Discord.
2842000	2851000	I was seeing that there's been a lot of advancement in Switch Homebrew this week, and there was a full, I didn't get a chance to watch that whole YouTube, so that's why I didn't want to bring it up totally on the show tonight.
2851000	2857000	But they have made some much bigger strides in getting Homebrew to actually work on the Switch this week.
2857000	2865000	You know, so even though you say that very tongue in cheek, oh, they'll just put it back? Well, we're getting closer to that being a reality, really.
2865000	2866000	Yeah.
2866000	2867000	Yeah.
2868000	2869000	Anyway.
2870000	2875000	Let's see, so Bobby found the whole little explanation he wanted to copy paste here, saying,
2875000	2886000	It's because the Flog was intended to be a omamori for Iwata or an amulet asking for a blessing. You don't open an omamori or else you lose its blessing.
2886000	2893000	When people found the Golf Iwata tribute, they opened the omamori. Omamori are replaced yearly, traditionally.
2893000	2897000	Oh, interesting, so maybe there's a new one in there. No, that might be taking it too far.
2897000	2899000	They don't make a way to open it.
2899000	2908000	And that's the thing, I get it, I totally respect that, I understand that, but did you think you were gonna sneak a game in the hardware and somebody wouldn't find it?
2908000	2912000	Like, again, hackers gonna hack, right? So, like, it was gonna get opened.
2912000	2913000	Yeah.
2913000	2922000	We'll see. It'll be interesting to see maybe if Golf ends up on this whole Nintendo thing that's coming in the next year or what they do there, but...
2922000	2932000	It could be. It could be on their online service, and since we'll never be able to open it because it'll never come out, the tradition lives on.
2932000	2933000	Now you're being mean.
2933000	2934000	Alright.
2934000	2936000	I'm just being realistic.
2936000	2940000	Alright, let's talk about some Sega hardware. Woohoo! We like Sega.
2940000	2946000	Since, you know, a lot of people are talking about, you know, SNES Classic and all that stuff this holiday season, let's talk about Sega hardware.
2946000	2960000	Well, there are some new systems coming out, not like a brand new Sega system, don't get too excited, but apparently this is the Retro-Bit Micro console, the folks that make the Retro-Bit console.
2961000	2971000	They are teaming up with Sega to do new products based on the Mega Drive or Genesis, the Saturn, and the Dreamcast. Yeah, that could be awesome.
2971000	2973000	So we might actually see Dreamcast games on one of these.
2973000	2979000	Yeah, because I could care less about the Sega, Genesis, or the Mega Drive because those have been out forever.
2979000	2981000	That's true. They have re-released those in boxes.
2981000	2988000	Several times, and they're trying to get in on that, that we, the NES and SNES Classic mini money.
2988000	2991000	Actually, nah, those Genesis things were out before that.
2991000	2994000	Right, exactly, but now they're trying to get in on that.
2994000	2995000	Okay, that's fair.
2995000	2998000	They're trying to figure out, but like, Dreamcast and Saturn, yeah, maybe I'm bored with that.
2998000	3004000	Yeah, oh yeah, for sure. I think especially with Dreamcast, especially, oh my gosh, if I could play Phantasy Star online again, I'd be so happy.
3004000	3011000	I'm not gonna go that far to expect that that'll be there. I think it'll be stuff more like, you know, Crazy Taxi, and I don't care.
3011000	3015000	You know, Space Channel 5, hey, I'm in for that, why not?
3016000	3023000	Anyway, so, Retro-Bit is promising to retain the original formats, but also doing upgrades like USB and Bluetooth.
3023000	3027000	Apparently, CES 2018, which is, what, it's only about a week away.
3027000	3028000	A few weeks away.
3028000	3030000	Yeah, it's the first weekend in January, I think.
3030000	3035000	We're gonna see more about this. They're saying they will tease that there, so that'll be very cool.
3035000	3042000	So, maybe, maybe next year's big thing will be the Dreamcast mini. Who knows? We can dream.
3042000	3049000	But, I mean, the thing with those retro Sega Genesises and the Atari flashbacks and stuff is that you could really find those really easy.
3049000	3056000	They certainly don't have a, in fact, with the flashbacks, I think they might make too many of those, because I usually see those on sale at some point.
3056000	3058000	Yeah, they're all over the place.
3058000	3063000	Yeah, they are, so. Alright, one more story for you, and then we're gonna get to the classic game of the week. Loki.
3063000	3072000	So, Universal Studios keeps putting out all these different rides based on video games, so now Universal Studios Japan is finally getting a Final Fantasy ride.
3072000	3084000	And, I guess they said, starting January 19th, the Final Fantasy is getting a roller coaster at Universal Studios Japan called Final Fantasy XR Ride.
3084000	3095000	It's a limited time ride, part of, I guess, their Cool Japan event. And, it'll be a VR-enabled roller coaster.
3098000	3107000	Pretty neat. And, I guess it's gonna end its run on June 24th. But, they have pictures of Sephiroth.
3107000	3115000	I think it's supposed to be a bunch of the different Final Fantasy games you travel through, because I guess Lightning's in it too, and some of the other characters.
3115000	3118000	So, I guess you travel from one fantasy to another.
3118000	3120000	This is the roller coaster.
3120000	3123000	Well, we have that release on PS4 coming up, so maybe.
3123000	3128000	Am I gonna go down a big hill and then run through Aerith as I go?
3128000	3129000	One can hope.
3129000	3131000	Like, it's the total Sephiroth simulator there?
3132000	3138000	We won't know until people ride the ride. But, that is interesting. It's an interesting way to do it, especially with the whole VR coaster.
3138000	3143000	I haven't been on one yet here, but I know they just put one in at the nearby Six Flags...
3143000	3146000	They still call it Six Flags Marine World. What the hell is it called now?
3146000	3148000	I'm so old and I'm cool.
3148000	3149000	Animal Kingdom or something?
3149000	3152000	Whatever it is. The one in Vallejo. Or, as I like to say, Valley Joe.
3152000	3156000	The one in Vallejo has a VR coaster they just put in.
3157000	3160000	The thing about that is, okay, cool, you can do the VR stuff.
3160000	3166000	But, because a lot of that is also software-based, it's not like you're having to lay all this new track.
3166000	3170000	You can kind of generate a new... I make it sound like, oh, you just do it overnight.
3170000	3172000	Obviously, no. It takes a team of graphics programmers.
3172000	3179000	But, probably still less people than it would to actually go out there and lay a new track to do a new coaster and tear the old one down.
3179000	3183000	Yeah, because they have all the motion data already in there and they're just re-skinning it, which is kind of cool.
3184000	3185000	Yeah.
3185000	3190000	Looking in chat, Bobby Blackwolf says, Six Flags Over Georgia has a VR coaster.
3190000	3193000	It's a regular coaster, but you can opt to wear a Gear VR.
3193000	3197000	Yeah, I think that's kind of what the Six Flags thing here is, too.
3197000	3198000	So, maybe they put them in a lot of different ones.
3198000	3206000	It looks cool. I mean, they've got them fighting and Seth Roth looking into this Japanese woman's eyes very lovingly as he murders...
3206000	3210000	Oh, and Chocobos. That was short. That was 15 seconds.
3210000	3219000	Well, I'm curious to see what this looks like and, you know, what they might kind of rotate in and out at different places.
3219000	3222000	I would like to see if it would come to Universal Studios over here as well.
3222000	3225000	It's all about Mario Kart VR whenever that comes out.
3225000	3228000	Well, Mario Land's going to be a real thing.
3228000	3229000	I know. I won't play that.
3229000	3231000	Or Super Nintendo World, whatever they're calling it.
3231000	3236000	Anyway, we're going to take a trip to old school land right now.
3236000	3239000	I'm going to say what we call the classic game of the week.
3239000	3246000	Every week, Dark Soccer jumps into the gaming vault, finds a game that she thinks, hey, you brats should check this game out and do this.
3246000	3255000	So, we're actually going to get her on the line right now through the magic of the telephone so Dark Soccer can actually tell us the classic game of the week.
3255000	3258000	And hopefully, she doesn't ignore the call because it's a weird number.
3258000	3260000	Oh, I think we have her there. Hi, Jamie. You there?
3260000	3262000	Yeah, I am.
3262000	3264000	Hi. Welcome to the show.
3264000	3265000	Hi.
3265000	3267000	Hi. Good to hear from you. I hope you're doing well.
3267000	3269000	Um, okay.
3269000	3275000	Yeah, alright. Are you sure you're good to do this segment tonight? You sound a little like you want to go back to bed.
3275000	3282000	Well, you know what? I was in bed and everyone kept waking me up with text messages.
3282000	3283000	Oh.
3283000	3289000	So, I just got up and I'm a little bit on coding right now.
3290000	3296000	So, we get to spend the last classic game of 2017 on drugs. Hooray.
3296000	3298000	Yay. Don't do drugs, kids.
3298000	3302000	How appropriate considering what's happening here tomorrow in California.
3302000	3308000	If you haven't already heard, a proposition that was passed a year or two ago is finally taking effect.
3308000	3312000	Oops, that was supposed to be your classic game.
3312000	3313000	I think it's just...
3313000	3314000	It's your classic commercial?
3314000	3318000	Classic commercial because I was an idiot and didn't have a password. Sorry about that.
3318000	3319000	What were you going to say, Jamie?
3319000	3322000	I think I'm just going to grow some bud in my backyard just because I can.
3322000	3323000	Just because you can.
3323000	3325000	It'll grow in my fairy garden.
3325000	3330000	So, Jamie, one thing I did not mention, I did see an article regarding it, though.
3330000	3338000	But they have, and I haven't downloaded it yet, because I just found out about it yesterday, but they have a VR Danganronpa thing.
3338000	3343000	They've had a VR Danganronpa thing for a while.
3343000	3347000	Oh, since I have you on the line, I was going to wait until you were back in studio to do this.
3347000	3350000	But you did send them to me in a message, so maybe you do want to get it out there tonight.
3350000	3356000	Before we get to the classic game of the week, would you like to share quickly your favorite game of 2017 and why?
3356000	3361000	Well, I have the top three, but one of them is really more favorite than the others.
3361000	3362000	Okay.
3362000	3373000	So, I would say that Breath of the Wild is my game, because we've already played through it on Wii U, and then I won the Switch at work.
3373000	3380000	So, we're playing through it again, and we've got all these Amiibo cards that I bought on Amazon.
3380000	3387000	So, we're trying to get all of the special goodies from the other games, and it's really fun.
3387000	3395000	It's revitalized our love for the series, so that's been getting more attention from me, I think,
3395000	3399000	except the fact that I've been going back and playing Dragon Age Inquisition a lot.
3399000	3408000	I'd also like to give the honorable mentions to Danganronpa Z3, even though I haven't gotten very far in it, because it's Danganronpa.
3408000	3415000	What else came out this year? Mass Effect Andromeda? I think it came out this year?
3415000	3418000	Yeah, it did. You had that on your list you sent to me.
3418000	3431000	Yeah, I played it a good bit. I really like the Legion WoW expansion, to be honest, although right now I don't have enough stability to play it right now.
3431000	3433000	That's fair. Codeine, it's fun.
3433000	3438000	But I like floating around and breaking old dungeons with my Demon Hunter. That's pretty fun.
3438000	3439000	There you go.
3439000	3452000	And I really do like, as far as IOS releases, I really do like the Animal Crossing Pocket Camp. That one's pretty fun.
3452000	3458000	I really enjoyed it, and I really play a good bit of it every day.
3458000	3461000	I have to be honest, I kind of gave up on that. Is there still a lot to do in that?
3462000	3471000	Oh yeah, they put out the flowers, and you can crossbreed your plants, and I'm trying to have a garden of nothing but black tulips, like my soul.
3471000	3479000	Fair enough. Well, let's get to the Classic Game of the Week for this week, which has nothing to do with any of these games we've talked about.
3479000	3484000	It does have to do with the classic system that I brought up over this year.
3484000	3485000	Okay, so here it is.
3485000	3487000	The first game out on that system.
3487000	3492000	The final Classic Game of 2017, bringing it full circle. What is your pick tonight, Arasaka?
3492000	3497000	It's Asuka 120% Burning Fest.
3500000	3505000	Which I think is a lot of cutscenes. A lot of long, extended segments. You're going to hear a little talking in the background here.
3505000	3508000	You can skip up into the fighting part of things.
3508000	3511000	Okay, if I can find one of the fighting parts here. Let me see.
3511000	3513000	Maybe ten minutes.
3513000	3520000	Yeah, I was like, this is a long intro. Oh wait, here's some fighting. Hold on, let me skip ahead to here.
3520000	3522000	There we go.
3522000	3524000	Okay.
3524000	3529000	But I would appreciate if you could turn it down a little bit, because I can't hear myself talk.
3529000	3531000	Oh, sorry.
3531000	3543000	Okay. Anyway, Asuka 120% Burning Fest was produced by Fill In Cafe and distributed by Family Soft in Kodansha.
3543000	3554000	It was actually programmed and designed by Imazumi Masatoshi, who also did a little game called Tanser Bandit.
3554000	3560000	Which, if anyone knows Tanser Bandit, it was reskinned as Tandemonium.
3560000	3564000	So, we've got a little bit of a Playstation link here.
3564000	3570000	It actually had some pretty good talent behind the design.
3570000	3582000	Manga artist, Alina Nase did the character designs, and she also did the Samurai Spirits 2 anime designs.
3582000	3590000	And a few other manga and games, so really good artists.
3590000	3600000	And then the music was done by Youmao Keishi, who did actually a good number of games for Terra Fantavica,
3600000	3606000	Paradise Lost, Mad Stalker, quite a few games.
3606000	3611000	So, we've got a really talented sound designer.
3611000	3617000	But anyway, the game itself came out on the FM Challenge.
3617000	3622000	So, that's why it went back to one of the classic games.
3622000	3628000	And it was released initially on March 11, 1994.
3628000	3631000	The series only came out in Japan.
3631000	3634000	But it had many iterations of the time.
3634000	3638000	I'm not even saying it's all that great of a game, it's an all-female fighting game.
3638000	3642000	Where it's set at the Ryōran Private School.
3642000	3650000	Where it's all for young girls from the upper edges of society.
3650000	3655000	And they have a martial arts tournament called the Club Rivalry Budget Contest Mega Fight.
3655000	3657000	Yeah, I'd sign up for that.
3658000	3662000	But it's an all-digital game.
3662000	3668000	So, there was a version released that had voice acting and dubbing,
3668000	3671000	which I think that's the version I've linked to the video.
3671000	3677000	It's Asuka 120% Special Burning Fest on PlayStation in 1996.
3677000	3682000	And then it had a couple of other releases later.
3683000	3691000	It was updated and released as Asuka 120% Excellent Burning Fest in 1997.
3691000	3696000	And then Asuka 120% Limited Burning Fest for Sega Saturn.
3696000	3700000	That's much better graphics and changes to the characters.
3700000	3711000	And then there was finally a 1999 release that was Asuka 120% Final Burning Fest.
3712000	3716000	And then there were other releases on PC.
3716000	3722000	It had Return Burning Fest, and then another Final Burning Fest on PlayStation,
3722000	3724000	which was part of the Super Life 1500 series.
3724000	3730000	And Limit Over Burning Fest, that was an unofficial release on Sega Saturn.
3730000	3732000	It came out in 1998.
3732000	3736000	But one of the other notable things about this game is that
3737000	3744000	basically, Fill-In Cafe was just two full-time programmers.
3744000	3748000	And they basically went on to treasure.
3748000	3753000	So, some of the games that they developed,
3753000	3757000	they were also behind Mad Stalker on the X68000,
3757000	3768000	and Makenna Makenna 2, Kimero Yokai Sori for PlayStation before Fill-In Cafe went bankrupt.
3768000	3772000	So we have our treasure link here as well.
3772000	3779000	But for a game that's only got six characters, it certainly did have quite the following.
3779000	3784000	The website actually is still up and running, the Japanese website.
3784000	3792000	It's Asuka 120% Burning Room, and you can go check out characters and look up stuff on them there.
3792000	3795000	You know, there's character models and whatnot.
3795000	3805000	But really, this is, I mean, it was kind of one of those niche games that fans either love or hate.
3805000	3810000	Like I said, it's not the most solid fighting game out there,
3810000	3816000	but it is one of the ones that began its life on the FM Towns,
3816000	3821000	and we got much wider releases later, and they kept updating and updating it.
3821000	3825000	So, there you go, Asuka 120% Burning Fest.
3825000	3833000	Alright, kind of bringing it full circle with the FM Towns from earlier this year and the classic system and all that.
3833000	3837000	There it is, your classic game of the week, Asuka 120% Burning Fest.
3838000	3840000	Eleven versions of the game.
3840000	3844000	Yeah, the noises you were hearing were from the Sega Saturn version of the game, just to clarify,
3844000	3847000	because I think you said it was the PlayStation in there, but that was the Sega Saturn version,
3847000	3851000	which was probably the one you had, if any of them, I'm assuming.
3851000	3855000	I think I've got it somewhere in the pile.
3855000	3862000	But I mean, it was always that game that whenever I went to import shops, it was always everywhere.
3862000	3867000	I mean, it's about, I'd say, a fairly common game.
3867000	3870000	You know, at least in my experience it was.
3870000	3873000	People might have a little bit more trouble finding it now.
3873000	3879000	I mean, if we look on eBay, I'm sure we could find a couple copies for various things.
3879000	3884000	Alright. Well, Jamie, feel better, and we hope to see you here next week,
3884000	3886000	but if it's a couple weeks, then it's a couple weeks.
3886000	3888000	But we'll see you soon, I hope.
3888000	3896000	By the way, if you did want it on Saturn, the most expensive one I found is 27 bucks.
3896000	3898000	Oh, that's not that bad.
3898000	3902000	Yeah, it's really cheap. However, the game is...
3902000	3906000	There's other games you could spend the money on.
3906000	3912000	Well, the Sharp X68000 version is 200 bucks, but then again, it is the Sharp X68000.
3912000	3915000	Yeah, that's gonna be a little harder console to find, so...
3915000	3919000	Alright. Well, I'm gonna let you go, Jamie. Enjoy the drugs.
3919000	3922000	Oh, yeah, I've been enjoying them a lot. Thank you.
3922000	3923000	Alright.
3923000	3928000	Hopefully it will make me not give a crap about how 2018 starts.
3928000	3931000	Alright, well take care and feel better.
3931000	3934000	Thank you. Bye.
3934000	3938000	Alright, always good to hear from Dark Sakura here on the show.
3938000	3940000	We are gonna take a quick break, though, but don't go anywhere.
3940000	3944000	We've got more Orange Launch Radio to come, including some rapid-fire news.
3944000	3947000	I don't know if we have mail tonight, but we'll log in and find out.
3947000	3950000	And some other gaming news, and then we'll open the Skype line.
3950000	3954000	I don't know if anyone's gonna call us, but we'll open the Skype line and see if we get anything.
3954000	3958000	And then that'll probably wrap it up here on this special New Year's Eve edition,
3958000	3960000	because we didn't want to go two weeks with no show.
3960000	3962000	So, you know, because we've done that already too much this year.
3962000	3964000	It's been a year.
3964000	3968000	So, a little special edition of Orange Launch Radio here to close out the year.
3968000	3972000	We'll be right back after this break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
3974000	3981000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
3981000	3987000	Live today, December 31st, New Year's Eve, with a special edition of our show
3987000	3990000	that's taping a little bit earlier in the day here.
3990000	3992000	Loki is joining me here in studio.
3992000	3997000	Dark Sakura just was on the phone with us, but is no longer here.
3997000	3999000	So, yes, Loki?
3999000	4003000	So, yeah. So, I bribed my son into coming in here to talk to us a little bit.
4003000	4006000	Okay. Amazing. I don't know how you did that, but congrats.
4006000	4008000	Power of Slurpees.
4008000	4010000	All right. So, can we say hello?
4010000	4013000	Pick up that mic and say hi to our listeners that are out there, if you don't mind.
4013000	4015000	How's it going?
4015000	4016000	Good.
4016000	4019000	Good, yeah. You've been playing Super Mario Odyssey in the other room, right?
4019000	4020000	Yeah.
4020000	4021000	Do you like that game?
4021000	4022000	Yes.
4022000	4025000	Why do you like Super Mario Odyssey? What is it about that game?
4026000	4036000	Well, so, it's just like you can throw the hat and you can turn into stuff. It's fun to do it.
4036000	4038000	When you're like throwing the hat and stuff, it's really cool?
4038000	4047000	Yeah, you can like throw it on them and then you can like throw it on stuff and then you can like turn into it.
4047000	4050000	What's your favorite like thing to throw a hat at?
4050000	4053000	Frog, because you can jump high.
4053000	4056000	Frogs are pretty cool, but don't bring them in the house.
4056000	4057000	Yeah.
4057000	4058000	Yeah.
4058000	4061000	So, you play a lot of, what was it, Roblox?
4061000	4062000	Yeah, Roblox.
4062000	4065000	So, in Roblox, what's your favorite game to play on that one?
4067000	4069000	Or what is Roblox, first off?
4069000	4082000	Well, Roblox is like a game where you can like make your own character, but you need to, some stuff like you need to use with Roblox, which you buy with real money.
4082000	4084000	Oh boy, I bet Dad loves that.
4084000	4089000	And then, and then you use it to like buy stuff in the game.
4089000	4090000	Like VIP-ers?
4090000	4091000	Yeah, like VIP.
4091000	4096000	So, I've seen you play like different like simulator games in there, like they have like a prison-
4096000	4097000	Subway simulator.
4097000	4102000	Subway simulator, so is that like a subway like the train or a subway like the restaurant?
4102000	4104000	A subway to the train.
4104000	4105000	Oh, okay.
4105000	4110000	Not the restaurant, because then I would just go in there and buy like a thousand million sandwiches.
4111000	4120000	And then I've seen you do one like, was it like a cake or something? Was it like a cake one where you make cakes or something and then you were killing somebody?
4120000	4121000	I don't remember how-
4121000	4123000	What? I wasn't killing anybody?
4123000	4124000	No.
4124000	4125000	With a cake? That seems-
4125000	4126000	If they have like-
4126000	4127000	What a delicious death.
4127000	4132000	I don't know, he had like simulators and stuff where he'll go and attack people like for money or something, I don't remember.
4133000	4141000	Well, there's some stuff where you need to like attack people and then you need to like evolve.
4141000	4145000	And then you play a lot of Wii U stuff, so what are your favorite games to play on Wii U?
4145000	4147000	Legend of Zelda.
4147000	4149000	Legend of Zelda.
4149000	4152000	The Breath of the Wild? The new one?
4152000	4153000	Both.
4153000	4155000	Both, and you got Wind Waker?
4155000	4157000	Yeah, I only have those two.
4157000	4158000	Cool.
4158000	4165000	What's your favorite thing to do in Zelda Breath of the Wild? Do you like to just run around or do you like to ride a horse or what do you like to do?
4165000	4167000	I like to throw in the bombs.
4167000	4169000	Do you like to use the bombs?
4169000	4175000	Come on, Nolgus wants to ask. Ask him if Loki steals his Legos. Do I steal your Legos?
4178000	4179000	Do I steal your Legos?
4179000	4180000	Kind of.
4180000	4181000	Kind of.
4181000	4182000	Kind of.
4182000	4189000	If you don't steal his Legos, I suggest he completes his Lego sets in a shorter period of time than three months.
4189000	4194000	I did hear that the presence of Dark Soccer and I got you, he ended up getting to use a lot, so.
4194000	4199000	Yes, yes. My youngest son Danny got the Lego Batman.
4199000	4201000	Lego Batman.
4201000	4211000	The Brickhead and then they got the Domino Rally, which we haven't, well we opened up the other day and my youngest son wants to take it out and spread it all over the floor and I'm like, no.
4211000	4218000	Let's not do that. I think he wanted, he thought that there was like cars in there and he wanted to play with the cars is what he wanted.
4218000	4219000	Oh.
4219000	4220000	So we did that.
4220000	4228000	I'm looking at our chat. Tigerclaw on chat says, does Loki, your dad, stay true to his name? Is he a trickster around the house?
4229000	4230000	What?
4230000	4231000	Are you a trickster?
4231000	4233000	Do I trick you a lot?
4233000	4235000	Does he like to do pranks? Does he trick you?
4235000	4242000	He sometimes tricks me, like that time on the field trip where you said the head's gonna eat you if you get close.
4242000	4243000	What?
4243000	4250000	Remember you said the head was gonna eat you when I get close and you're tricking me.
4250000	4251000	I don't remember that.
4251000	4254000	It's probably something adults lie about to make kids behave.
4254000	4262000	You just have to understand, one thing you learn as you're a parent is there's a certain age where kids will believe anything that you tell them and it's fun just to kind of mess with that.
4262000	4263000	And so.
4263000	4264000	Okay.
4264000	4266000	When I'm an adult, I'm gonna do that.
4266000	4268000	Yes you will and you'll learn the joy that.
4268000	4269000	Do you.
4269000	4276000	One more question here from one of our listeners, Bobby Blackwolf, who asks, who completes things they build first? Josh or Loki?
4279000	4283000	He is referring to the fact that I've not finished my game.
4284000	4286000	Yeah, you've never finished your game.
4286000	4287000	Yes.
4287000	4288000	All your games.
4288000	4290000	Yes, that's correct.
4290000	4291000	Yeah, drag him.
4292000	4293000	All right.
4293000	4298000	Well, technically he hasn't finished most of his Lego sets either, so we're tied.
4298000	4299000	Only two.
4299000	4301000	Only two.
4301000	4304000	Well, two that you've started, you still have one that's in a box.
4304000	4306000	I can now see the resemblance here.
4308000	4309000	I'm screaming over here.
4309000	4312000	All right, anything else we need to ask Josh about?
4312000	4314000	Did you want to plug your YouTube channel?
4314000	4315000	Wait, Josh has a YouTube channel?
4315000	4316000	He does have a YouTube channel.
4316000	4317000	I didn't know that.
4318000	4327000	I don't know if my wife wants a lot of people in the middle, but your YouTube channel, the one that you do with your, what is it, Josh and Danny music and games?
4327000	4328000	No.
4328000	4330000	He doesn't want to plug his YouTube channel.
4330000	4332000	All right, but it's a secret for now.
4332000	4337000	Yeah, I said in one year I put one video on.
4337000	4338000	That's all right.
4338000	4339000	I put one video on.
4339000	4342000	That's why I asked your dad how many games he's published in a year.
4343000	4346000	One of these days I'll publish something in a year.
4346000	4347000	You'll have to be quiet.
4347000	4349000	So enjoy it while you can now.
4350000	4354000	No, but there's, uh, no, he plays the piano, so he does that.
4354000	4360000	And, um, the only hardest part of my homework is my piano.
4360000	4368000	And he likes, um, I kind of played the piano when I was about your age, except I played what was called the organ.
4368000	4369000	I'm seven.
4369000	4370000	You know an organ?
4371000	4372000	No.
4372000	4373000	The organ's like two pianos.
4373000	4374000	One's on top of the other.
4374000	4375000	That's what I used to play.
4375000	4377000	Oh, yeah, I think that is.
4377000	4385000	So, um, so yeah, he plays the piano, so he records some videos of him doing that, but he really looks up to Ryan's toy review.
4385000	4387000	It's, it's a video.
4387000	4392000	Well, there's videos where, basically he does everything.
4392000	4399000	They do like a lot of blogging and toy opening and stuff like that, but he's like one of the most insanely popular kids channels.
4399000	4405000	He's like a multi-millionaire now because, yeah, from opening toys and doing stuff with your family.
4405000	4406000	I like to open toys.
4406000	4407000	Exactly!
4407000	4408000	I like toys.
4408000	4411000	Why am I not getting millions of dollars, you know?
4411000	4414000	Because you're not playing a YouTube channel of toys.
4414000	4416000	Well, we need to do that.
4416000	4418000	We just need to vlog all this stuff we do and open toys.
4418000	4423000	That's why I made my, uh, my channel for toys.
4423000	4424000	Your toys channel?
4424000	4425000	So I can be rich.
4426000	4430000	I can't wait for your kid to make more money off YouTube than you've ever made off this show.
4430000	4432000	It won't take long.
4432000	4434000	It won't take long at all.
4434000	4435000	Alright.
4435000	4440000	But I'm, uh, I'm not gonna make huge, like, eggs.
4440000	4443000	He doesn't want to do the big surprise eggs, I guess.
4443000	4446000	Yeah, they have, like, a bunch of toys that we don't get for toys.
4446000	4449000	You gotta talk into the microphone, they can't hear you otherwise.
4449000	4450000	I know.
4450000	4451000	Okay.
4451000	4452000	Alright.
4452000	4456000	Any final thoughts for the show?
4456000	4458000	You wanna go back to playing Super Mario Odyssey?
4458000	4460000	Yes!
4460000	4461000	Just say bye.
4461000	4463000	Bye, bye!
4463000	4464000	Alright.
4464000	4470000	Josh, everybody, Loki's child, making his debut on the show.
4470000	4472000	Give a round of applause, even though there's really nobody here.
4472000	4473000	Good job, Josh.
4473000	4474000	Alright.
4474000	4475000	There you go.
4475000	4476000	They're applauding out there.
4476000	4477000	Why don't you take your coat off?
4477000	4478000	You're probably hot.
4478000	4479000	Alright.
4479000	4480000	Alright, fine.
4480000	4481000	Go play Super Mario Odyssey.
4481000	4483000	We've got some comments in chat here.
4483000	4486000	Does Josh have any last minute stories?
4486000	4488000	Dungeon Buster says, Super Josh Odyssey.
4488000	4489000	And Dark Tetsuya says, He's adorable.
4489000	4490000	There you go.
4490000	4491000	Seal of approval from chat.
4491000	4492000	Alright.
4492000	4493000	Alright, thanks.
4493000	4494000	Buy Josh a Switch.
4494000	4496000	Yes, he would probably like it if I got a Switch.
4496000	4499000	And honestly, like, you should've heard before the show.
4499000	4502000	Josh was like, Let's go after the show and buy one.
4502000	4505000	I'm like, I can't, Mommy would get mad if I spent the time.
4505000	4507000	Yeah, Mommy would get very mad, I think.
4507000	4508000	Have the money on a Switch.
4508000	4511000	Alright, let's get into some rapid fire news, Loki.
4511000	4515000	Okay, so let's talk a little bit about PlayStation Plus in January.
4515000	4516000	Actually getting some decent games.
4516000	4522000	Deus Ex Mankind Divided is gonna be the free game as well as Batman the Telltale series.
4522000	4523000	That's on PlayStation 4.
4523000	4528000	PlayStation 3, you're getting Sacred 3 and The Book of Unwritten Tales 2.
4528000	4532000	And then on the Vita, you're getting a couple cross-buy games as well for PlayStation 4,
4532000	4537000	which is Psycho-Pass mandatory happiness and Uncanny Valley.
4537000	4542000	So Psycho-Pass, is that related to the Weird Al Yankovic album as well?
4542000	4543000	I wish.
4543000	4545000	You know, that would be pretty cool.
4545000	4549000	But hey, Deus Ex looks pretty cool, so hope I check those out.
4549000	4553000	And those are free if you have PlayStation Plus, which you probably do if you have a PlayStation system.
4554000	4560000	Alright, and then last but not least, there is a ROM hack out there for Super Mario Land 2,
4560000	4564000	which adds color, because if you remember, it was a Game Boy game.
4564000	4570000	And Game Boys were pretty much monochrome green back in the 90s.
4570000	4574000	And so now this is actually like a Game Boy Color version of the game.
4574000	4577000	And they even have it where you can dump it to a ROM and you can play it.
4577000	4581000	And they'll even give you the error if you try to play it on a regular Game Boy,
4581000	4584000	where it says this is a Game Boy Color game.
4584000	4585000	That's kind of neat.
4585000	4589000	Yeah, and it looks pretty nice looking, so you can check that out.
4589000	4592000	Has anyone tried to reverse dump that onto a cartridge to actually play it on Game Boy Color?
4592000	4593000	Yeah, they've done that.
4593000	4594000	Oh, cool.
4594000	4596000	You can actually dump that onto a cartridge, yeah.
4598000	4599000	Wow.
4600000	4601000	Alright.
4601000	4606000	Well, moving on to some other stories, let's talk about the upcoming Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection.
4606000	4607000	Some fans in Japan.
4607000	4613000	So it's not just people in the US on Twitter that create sometimes a lot of controversy,
4613000	4619000	because it's even happening in Japan that they are very upset about some, well not everybody,
4619000	4624000	but some fans in Japan are upset about some of the decisions made for Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection.
4624000	4628000	This actually, it does kind of make sense though, like I actually get why they're mad.
4628000	4632000	If you haven't heard, there's going to be 12 games in this 30th Anniversary edition,
4632000	4637000	which they announced a few weeks ago, including Street Fighter II, Street Fighter II Turbo,
4637000	4640000	3rd Strike, Street Fighter Alpha, et cetera, et cetera.
4641000	4643000	But, here's the crazy part.
4643000	4647000	Since all titles contents are based on the overseas versions,
4647000	4650000	the titles, voicing, and text will be in English.
4651000	4657000	So, meaning that the Street Fighter Alpha series, which was called Street Fighter Zero in Japan,
4657000	4663000	they're going to go with the English title names, and so they're basically not changing anything for Japan,
4663000	4670000	and I think that even means going so far as to, like, that the names of the characters are going to be all messed up,
4670000	4673000	because you know, over in Japan, what was it?
4673000	4676000	What we know as Balrog was...
4676000	4677000	Vega?
4677000	4679000	No, what we know as Balrog...
4679000	4680000	M. Bison?
4680000	4685000	How was it, yeah. M. Bison was that, and then Vega was the last boss, which we have as M. Bison,
4685000	4690000	and then the guy that climbs the walls, we have as Vega, but that was Balrog.
4690000	4692000	So it's all messed up, right?
4692000	4696000	So that is, apparently none of that's getting changed for Japan.
4696000	4699000	So it's kind of like, you get the 30th Anniversary Collection,
4699000	4704000	but we hope you enjoy the additions from the Americas, because that's what you're getting.
4704000	4710000	So, Japanese fans are a little upset they're not taking the time to provide the Japanese versions.
4710000	4712000	So, anyway.
4712000	4714000	Dartetsuya, interesting.
4714000	4718000	That's why Ivo uses universal names for the characters.
4718000	4722000	Boxer, Claw, Dictator. Interesting.
4722000	4723000	Boxer, Claw, Dictator.
4723000	4725000	Yeah, makes sense. Alright.
4725000	4736000	So anyway, it works both ways around, I suppose, is that sometimes Japanese fans get upset about things not being localized over there either.
4736000	4741000	Anyway, my last, or my next rapid-fire story won't load, but I'm going to try to do this from memory.
4741000	4745000	They are re-releasing, I suppose, Catherine.
4745000	4750000	You know that game, that was a big, kind of like, it was like a puzzle game, it was a little bit cultish.
4750000	4754000	They are re-releasing that on the PlayStation 4 as what's called Catherine Full Body,
4754000	4762000	and I'm hearing it is kind of like a remaster of the first game, but it sounds like there might be some extra content there.
4762000	4767000	It's kind of like New Game Plus, I suppose. They're going back and adding some new stuff to it.
4767000	4776000	Yeah, they're saying that basically this came out of Weekly Famitsu, so they've got, I guess, a profile for the third Catherine,
4776000	4780000	because if you remember from Catherine, there was two different Catharines that were in there, but now they're adding a third.
4781000	4788000	And I guess along with that, there's, I don't know, they don't really talk too much about it.
4788000	4795000	There's some streams that they're doing as well on YouTube and NicoNico, or they did those, I guess those were on the 22nd.
4795000	4801000	And yeah, so it looks like it's just kind of an expanded version of the game.
4801000	4807000	Yeah, so I kind of missed it the first time around, so maybe I'll get around to checking it out this time, we'll see.
4807000	4815000	Yeah, just depends on price and time and all that good stuff, but I know the first game had its fans, so I'm sure some folks are excited to kind of see that come full circle.
4815000	4822000	Alright, this is the part of the show where we talk about what's coming out in stores this week, but I think with the holidays, we're really empty,
4822000	4827000	so we're going to just kind of skip past that this week and get back into some releases next year, right?
4827000	4832000	Do we have anything in early January? I know I'm kind of asking you a question about something you might not be prepared to answer.
4832000	4835000	Why do we know Dissidia is a January title next year, right?
4835000	4847000	Yeah, I don't know what they've got coming as far as 2018. They usually get some stuff in January, but it's not normally until the second or third week, usually.
4847000	4850000	Let's take a quick peek here real fast.
4850000	4852000	Sorry to put you on the spot.
4852000	4863000	No worries. January, the first release I show is actually on the 11th, so they have The Escapists 2 on the Nintendo Switch, followed by the 16th with Street Fighter V, the arcade edition.
4863000	4865000	Oh, right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4865000	4872000	So, yeah, there's Dissidia. I mean, just kind of going over some of the stuff. There's Dragon Ball FighterZ. Jamie will be very pleased with that.
4872000	4876000	Dissidia Final Fantasy NT is going to be coming to the PlayStation 4 by the end of the month.
4878000	4881000	And looking way ahead, February, they've got Civ VI Rise and Fall.
4881000	4889000	Yeah, that's the expansion, yeah. It didn't make our show roll tonight, but they announced there's going to be another leader for India, I guess, in that expansion.
4889000	4908000	So that it's not always Gandhi that's threatening to nuke you, which goes back to a bug in the classic Civilization game, where basically Gandhi was supposed to be so not like that that I think it subtracted two or something, and then that caused the odometer to roll over, so it actually set him on the ultra-highest setting.
4908000	4929000	I'm like really crappily explaining this, but basically we'll say a math bug caused him to be the most extreme when it came to declaring war and bombing people, which obviously is not what Gandhi was, but it just kind of makes for a funny Civilization game, I suppose. It is just a video game, after all.
4929000	4941000	Yeah, Monster Hunter World, and then looking into February, they've got, what else have we got here? Looks like Metal Gear Survive.
4942000	4944000	Oh god, I forgot all about that.
4944000	4945000	The Bananas Switch releases.
4945000	4947000	Yeah, I'm excited about that, so that'll be cool.
4947000	4948000	There's lots of stuff coming.
4948000	4953000	Well, this is a good chance for you guys to catch up on gaming backlogs, and if you're like me, I'm sure you have a ton of them.
4954000	4961000	Alright, we would usually do emails here as well, but our email bag's looking a little empty, so send us something for next year, would ya?
4961000	4966000	Participate at orangelauntrader.com if you'd like to say hello, comment on any news story that we've been talking about.
4966000	4982000	We get some really good insights sometimes from people that are like, hey, I work at XYZ Place, or hey, this game you guys didn't know much about, I played a lot of this game, so we always appreciate those insights, because there's only so many hours in a day, and we do all hold down day jobs too, so sometimes we can't get around to literally everything.
4983000	4987000	Anyway, we will pick back up then with some other news. Loki.
4987000	4999000	As I've been hinting throughout the show, Nintendo, their paid online service, which still hasn't released and has been delayed and delayed and delayed is now being delayed again.
4999000	5003000	So now they're saying that it's been pushed back to fall of 2018.
5003000	5004000	Wow.
5005000	5016000	I mean, I don't know what this is, what is the holdup? Like really, what is the holdup at this point? It's like 19 months after the...
5016000	5026000	I would literally have to invent things, because we have no idea what it is, what they're working on, I can only think maybe performance issues, but I mean, that's not really being fair to anybody, it's just a guess.
5026000	5034000	I mean, I hate making fun of Nintendo for being totally green and online, but...
5034000	5046000	Well, here's the plus, there is a plus to this, you don't have to pay to play Splatoon online for another year potentially, so wasn't there something too about that this may only be impacting certain countries?
5046000	5050000	Because Nintendo hasn't officially said anything yet, right?
5050000	5056000	They haven't said anything, it originally was delayed this spring 2018, but they haven't really said too much about it.
5056000	5068000	They're saying that apparently, this is according to Nintendo, the Italian Nintendo website, so Nintendo Italy is showing that it's been delayed to fall of 2018, so the assumption is well, it's a worldwide launch.
5068000	5071000	And we know it may not necessarily be worldwide.
5071000	5078000	I kinda don't understand why they'd hold it back in certain places only, especially a place like Italy, what did they do, you know?
5078000	5085000	Like, what's special in an online capacity regard, what is special about Italy compared to say, the rest of Europe, you know?
5085000	5092000	Well, I don't know, so we don't know yet because they're quiet about it, so don't be surprised.
5092000	5103000	Again, rumor, capital rumor, is that there's supposed to be a Nintendo Direct in early January, which would make sense because they're gonna start to detail some of the gaming releases.
5103000	5110000	We know we have Bayonetta coming, but they're gonna really want to lay out, here's what to get hyped about in January, February, March, April, May, so it would make sense that they would do a Direct.
5110000	5121000	And if they don't address it in the Direct, I think it's safe to say it's delayed, because if it was supposed to be debuting in early 2018, we would kinda hear something in this Direct, I would think.
5121000	5122000	So...
5124000	5137000	Yeah, I'm just surprised. I mean, I don't know. I would've thought, it seems like if it's coming out like 19 months after a console's been released, that's like pretty poor planning. Like, you couldn't... I don't know.
5137000	5142000	I'm trying to think, though, haven't? I mean, it's not like, well, yeah, I mean, it's online.
5142000	5143000	This isn't...
5143000	5145000	Yeah, it's not like a redesign of the dashboard or...
5145000	5153000	But this isn't like the first time they delayed. So I remember with the original Wii web browser and stuff, that was delayed as well after launch, and then you had to pay for it.
5153000	5160000	And I don't know, back in that time period, jeez. But like, I'm just surprised.
5160000	5168000	Okay, I knew there had to be some of this. Bobby Blackwolf points out Xbox Live didn't come out on the original Xbox for two years.
5168000	5169000	But maybe...
5169000	5172000	But did they ever plan to have that at launch? Or was that like a...
5172000	5179000	Well, and I also kind of strike it up to one of those things where it's like, well, you don't know what you're missing until you have it.
5179000	5182000	And that was the first. Xbox Live was kind of the first, right?
5182000	5188000	And so now, you know, at that point, those first two years of Xbox Live, you didn't know what you were missing until you had it.
5188000	5194000	And now that's kind of where we're at with Nintendo. But it's not like you can play Splatoon Online.
5195000	5201000	You do have that phone app, which, you know, it's not... I think everybody's kind of worked around with the voice chat.
5201000	5207000	But it does provide that enhanced breakdown of your stats in Splatoon 2 and being able to see what's in the stores.
5207000	5211000	I mean, it's a little something that wasn't there before. So it's not like there isn't anything at all.
5211000	5218000	I think the big question mark is, what the heck is going on with Virtual Console and Online and that whole thing?
5218000	5222000	I think that's more of it. It's not like online play doesn't work. Look at Splatoon 2.
5222000	5226000	And I know I keep going back to that one. That's the first thing that comes to my mind. Mario Kart is also online.
5226000	5229000	You know, there are Nintendo games that perform online right now.
5229000	5237000	It's just, we don't know what the extra stuff, which is namely, I guess, Virtual Console, we don't know what any of that's going to be.
5237000	5243000	But then here's the other weird thing about Virtual Console and all that. I don't know if you know this, but over this holiday break,
5243000	5251000	I think it was just either like on Christmas Day or the day before, that versus Super Mario Brothers came out for Arcade Archives.
5251000	5259000	So you can play kinda the original Super Mario Brothers on Nintendo Switch now. Kinda.
5259000	5265000	But of course, that versus Super Mario Brothers, it was different. It was a little bit harder. There's some missing things.
5265000	5270000	And then even when you get into it, like the warp zones don't all work. You can only go to level six.
5270000	5278000	And then when you get that far in the game, like levels are straight up replaced with levels that are in Super Mario Brothers 2 Japan,
5278000	5282000	which is lost levels here, which as you remember, those levels were very hard.
5282000	5289000	So anyway, so it's kind of like a mishmash of all these different elements of, I guess, the first two Mario Brothers games overseas.
5289000	5296000	But anyway, the point is you can play Super Mario Brothers on the Switch kinda right now.
5296000	5301000	So, but it won't be the same thing you guys remember. Anyway.
5301000	5307000	All right. But Bobby does want to clarify the Ethernet port was there at launch.
5307000	5313000	But was that intended for LAN? Because here's the thing is I remember that the Halo, the original Halo game was all like a...
5313000	5316000	Was the original Halo LAN? I thought it was.
5316000	5317000	Yeah, it's the same link, yeah.
5317000	5319000	Or was it Halo 2? Yeah, I think it was the original Halo.
5319000	5323000	Because I remember, I'm trying to remember when I first got into Xbox.
5323000	5326000	Remember, I've told this story before, I played it at a wedding.
5326000	5331000	And the wedding reception they had, yes they did, they had Halo. Was it Halo or Halo 2?
5331000	5332000	They had it, but it was a local area network.
5332000	5333000	I think they both did.
5333000	5335000	Yeah. And that was when I got hooked on Halo.
5335000	5340000	And I was like, I did not think I would enjoy a first person shooter, but this is so much fun. So.
5340000	5345000	Anyway. And Bobby's clarified, yes, Halo 1 had LAN.
5345000	5348000	I don't know, it's so long ago, I barely remember.
5348000	5349000	It's been over 10 years.
5349000	5352000	It has been a bit closer to 15 at this point.
5352000	5354000	I know, totally classic game material.
5354000	5361000	The original Xbox was before this show. I remember buying an Xbox the first or second year of the show.
5361000	5366000	Because I finally got swayed by UltraMix. Remember we had that guy, he brought his Xbox to the show.
5366000	5370000	What was his name, Ryan? Zero? Something like that was his name. Remember that guy?
5370000	5371000	Yeah, maybe.
5371000	5375000	And he came and he brought his Xbox. And I was like, UltraMix is actually kind of rad.
5375000	5378000	And then when UltraMix 2 happened, I had to have an Xbox.
5379000	5384000	Because that was the best DDR game. And I still say to this day, the best home DDR game they ever did was UltraMix 2.
5385000	5387000	Was that where they had the different drum stuff?
5387000	5391000	Yeah, that was when they started licensing the synth pop and it really started to go a different direction.
5391000	5393000	And then they killed it.
5393000	5400000	Yeah, unfortunately. Anyway. Let's move on. Did you want to talk about the chips too, while we're here?
5400000	5410000	Yeah, we can talk about the chips. So, they're also delaying the 64 gigabit or gigabyte chips. I'm assuming it's gigabyte chips.
5410000	5417000	So, I guess originally they were supposed to be in the hands of developers already.
5417000	5421000	But apparently now it's going to be coming out in 2019.
5421000	5430000	And I guess one thing with that, from what I hear, is that a lot of people aren't using the 32 gigabyte ones that are already available.
5430000	5437000	And so, right now a way developers have been kind of getting around it is just having a large download after the fact.
5437000	5441000	Yeah, is this just a cost thing? This might be a stupid question.
5441000	5447000	But I'm just assuming that a 32 gig cart costs more than a 16 or an 8 gig cart.
5447000	5454000	And so, to make more money, they are using the smaller carts and doing the download.
5454000	5458000	Yeah. Because it's your data that you can use.
5458000	5463000	That's right. That's your 900 gigabytes that the Xbox is downloading in a month.
5463000	5467000	Yeah. I don't know.
5467000	5475000	Moving on. Let's talk about, again, these are rumors, but it's a slower show this week, so I'm allowing a few more rumors than usual.
5475000	5481000	But it's a game that people get excited about. It's Pokemon and the upcoming Gen 8 game, which we know is for Switch.
5481000	5485000	That part we know. Nintendo's confirmed that the next generation of Pokemon will be on Switch.
5485000	5489000	And we kind of know that Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon were kind of the last on the 3DS.
5489000	5493000	And could the game be going through some changes when it comes to the Switch?
5493000	5497000	Well, there's some information kind of leaking out there on the web.
5497000	5500000	And, you know, again, take it with a grain of salt.
5500000	5506000	But the Chinese localization team has apparently already finished translating the game script.
5506000	5509000	There's not going to be any new mega evolutions introduced in the games.
5509000	5514000	There will be Z-moves, and they use motion control to activate using the Joy-Cons.
5514000	5518000	Now, all of this sounds like, okay, yeah, this could all be real.
5518000	5522000	The central plot revolves around the conflict between tradition and innovation.
5522000	5527000	Okay, sure. Region inspiration been rumored to be Spain or Italy.
5527000	5532000	Which, okay, yeah, I mean, X and Y was kind of France inspired, if I remember right.
5532000	5534000	And Sun and Moon was definitely Hawaii.
5534000	5538000	And every Pokemon game has been inspired by a certain region.
5538000	5540000	Which region did they say it was again?
5540000	5542000	Spain or Italy.
5542000	5548000	Poor Italy. You know, getting a region in Pokemon, but not getting there, you know, online for the Switch.
5548000	5550000	Yeah.
5550000	5556000	Also, though, the biggest, probably, like, big piece that would be a huge change to the whole thing
5556000	5559000	is that apparently the battle system is getting simplified.
5559000	5562000	That could be controversial, and that's the part where I kind of go,
5562000	5565000	I don't know. I don't know if everybody would be down for that.
5565000	5572000	But it's going to be, I guess, similar to Digimon World, which seems like sacrilege, but whatever.
5572000	5579000	And Pokken Tournament with more of a rock, scissors, paper type of attack, block, or grab.
5579000	5583000	I don't, see, and I don't know if I'm, that doesn't really make sense to me.
5583000	5589000	Because the typing is so important and is kind of the whole, like, rock, paper, scissors thing, right?
5589000	5594000	Like, water beats fire, grass beats water, fire beats grass, right?
5594000	5596000	Like, that's your rock, paper, scissors stuff.
5596000	5597000	Yeah.
5597000	5603000	So, I don't really understand why, and I get, I know that there is this whole system in Pokken and everything as well,
5603000	5607000	but, like, Pokken is also, like, a fast-paced type of game.
5607000	5612000	There's a lot going on, like, right now, and so it kind of had to have a different system,
5612000	5617000	but with the more traditional Pokemon games, they're more of, like, a role-playing game.
5617000	5620000	So, I don't know, I don't know if this makes as much sense.
5620000	5623000	I mean, I guess we'll see, but...
5623000	5624000	Yeah.
5624000	5628000	I'm excited for Pokemon Gen 8, though. I really am excited to see it on the Switch,
5628000	5633000	and the fact that I can pick it up and take it with me and play it on the TV is going to be great.
5633000	5636000	Like, I really wish I could have done that for some of the 3DS games.
5636000	5638000	I probably would have been more into it if that was the case.
5638000	5642000	So, go into our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
5642000	5645000	Act-F says, that works in Pokken.
5645000	5647000	It's dumb to apply it to the regular games.
5647000	5650000	Pokken is a fighting game. It needs the triangle system.
5650000	5654000	Pokemon has way more going for it to have way oversimplified.
5654000	5658000	Well, yeah, and in Pokken, you can't really, I don't think it does anyway.
5658000	5661000	Correct me if I'm wrong, Act-F, but I don't think it does the whole
5661000	5664000	water beats fire beats, you know, that whole thing,
5664000	5668000	because it's a fighting game and you need the characters to be a little more equal.
5668000	5672000	Like, you don't want one character to be stronger than another just because of the typing.
5672000	5675000	In Pokken, it's different, so that's why they have this kind of different system.
5675000	5677000	So, anyway.
5677000	5679000	That's what I thought. Thank you, Act-F.
5679000	5681000	Act-F agrees with me.
5681000	5684000	Alright, anyhow, let's move on. I know rumors are not the most fun stories,
5684000	5686000	but it's a slower time to hear.
5686000	5687000	Let's talk more rumors!
5687000	5688000	Uh-oh.
5688000	5690000	But this one has a little more substance to it, right?
5690000	5694000	Possibly. Hopefully it's not a faked screenshot, but apparently, allegedly,
5694000	5700000	there was a PlayStation Network page that went live for Destiny 2's second expansion,
5700000	5707000	titled Gods of Mars, and it was also leaked onto Reddit with a few screenshots.
5707000	5711000	They said that basically it talks about that the Guardian will be exploring
5711000	5716000	the frigid Vale of Mars, and will go up against, I guess,
5716000	5722000	Charlemagne, who imprisoned Rasputin after reawaking Mars,
5722000	5727000	and they are supposed to be freeing Rasputin and defeating Charlemagne.
5727000	5734000	And they've got new story missions, new themed weapons armors, co-op,
5734000	5738000	co-op multiplayer arenas, new enemy factions and bosses,
5738000	5741000	and, of course, now it's supposed to be 20 bucks.
5741000	5744000	Coming out March 2018.
5744000	5746000	And I fell off that Destiny train so fast.
5746000	5750000	Like, I was really into it for like a week, and then I got distracted.
5750000	5752000	And I think what hasn't helped is then they're like,
5752000	5754000	oh, this expansion came out and you've got to buy this expansion now
5754000	5757000	to kind of really see what else is in the game.
5757000	5760000	And it's like, I barely, I think because I waited for the PC release,
5760000	5763000	I kind of screwed a lot of that up because the time between the PC release
5763000	5767000	and expansion was a lot less than, say, somebody who got it on PlayStation 4
5767000	5769000	or Xbox One in the expansion.
5769000	5773000	So it was like, where did the time go with the first game?
5773000	5774000	Oh, well.
5774000	5777000	Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Dungeon Buster says,
5777000	5781000	people are pretty upset with Destiny 2 right now, especially with the expansion.
5781000	5785000	Yeah, I've heard that they've actually had to go in and do another patch for the game
5785000	5789000	because I guess, you know, end game content was getting pretty hosed by this expansion
5789000	5792000	and some of the people who hadn't bought it were getting really irritated.
5792000	5795000	Well, yeah, they had it. It was content that was available already
5795000	5799000	and then they paywalled it, like, after it's been available for a while
5799000	5805000	behind the expansion because it was end game stuff, which was just like, what the hell?
5805000	5808000	And then they were messing with the XP gains.
5808000	5813000	At least you can still play stuff like World of Warcraft if you don't have the expansions.
5813000	5818000	You might have a lot harder of a time finding a party for the content you want to do,
5818000	5821000	but, you know, you can do it.
5823000	5826000	I don't know. There's just been a whole lot of Destiny 2 backlash
5826000	5830000	and the whole, you know, Eververse thing is just not helping.
5830000	5833000	Funny you bring that up because Dungeon Buster actually says in chat,
5833000	5838000	if you go to the official forums, there are pages of nothing but remove Eververse
5838000	5841000	because of the way they did the loot tables in the game, especially with the Cyrus.
5841000	5843000	Right, yeah, did you hear about their Christmas event that they did?
5843000	5844000	No, I didn't.
5844000	5847000	So they had a holiday event and, you know, whereas most holiday events in games,
5847000	5851000	you know, you go in there, they have Christmas themed loot boxes and all that stuff.
5851000	5853000	Yeah, Heroes of the Storm is doing that right now.
5853000	5854000	Yeah, so they made it impossible.
5854000	5855000	I got a snowflake mount last night.
5855000	5859000	Nice. So they made it so that it was impossible to get all of the, you know,
5859000	5862000	basically to unlock most of the stuff in those loot boxes.
5862000	5868000	They paywalled the stuff that they were giving out as part of the Christmas thing behind stuff.
5868000	5872000	So instead of giving out these things and having, you know, stuff that you could get,
5872000	5875000	you know, maybe incorporating that into the normal loot boxes.
5875000	5879000	Like, you know, with Overwatch, you get, you know, holiday stuff themed within that.
5880000	5886000	Well, in this, it was separate. You have to have certain engrams to unlock those holiday loot boxes.
5886000	5894000	It's just, it's so greedy. This is just a perfect example.
5894000	5897000	I think it's going to come back to bite them all. I think it is. Anyway.
5897000	5901000	All right. Well, hopefully this game won't have any special boxes or DLC.
5901000	5904000	And again, we don't know what it's going to be.
5904000	5910000	There is a teaser site that has come up for a new Space Invaders project in 2018,
5910000	5915000	which of course, what, like only like the biggest arcade game ever in Japan, right?
5915000	5919000	And certainly everybody here knows Space Invaders as well. It was hugely popular over here.
5919000	5924000	But I think what's more, I mean, okay, Space Invaders is kind of an older game at this point.
5924000	5927000	I'm not sure a lot of people get really into like the old, old Space Invaders,
5927000	5932000	but this game has been reinvented several times in pretty cool ways.
5932000	5936000	Like Groove Coaster is kind of Space Invaders-y in a way.
5936000	5941000	Like they use a lot of the same like art, but especially like I think of Space Invaders Extreme,
5941000	5943000	the one that was kind of like, it was on PSP, I think.
5943000	5944000	Yeah.
5944000	5947000	I think they did a version on Xbox Arcade and some of that.
5947000	5948000	Yeah.
5948000	5951000	But like with the techno music and stuff as you play, it was a really cool game.
5951000	5953000	Like it was a really neat reinvention.
5953000	5957000	And then what they had Arknoid versus Space Invaders not that long ago, and that was kind of fun too.
5957000	5960000	So like they've been reinventing Space Invaders in some really cool ways.
5960000	5962000	Oh, and the thing at the arcade.
5962000	5966000	That's something I played during the break that I haven't talked about on the show yet.
5966000	5971000	Randomly, Shane and I went over to, you know, the place up in Rockland that has all the music games.
5971000	5973000	So we went up there, it's like a place in Neon FM.
5973000	5977000	And they have one of those giant, now it's Space Invaders, but it spits out tickets.
5977000	5980000	But this thing is so colorful and bright and loud, right?
5980000	5981000	Have you seen these things?
5981000	5982000	No, I haven't.
5982000	5983000	I'm surprised they didn't have one at Golf Land.
5983000	5985000	They may have, but I didn't walk around too much.
5985000	5988000	I literally went through, we just went upstairs and like didn't look at most of the games.
5988000	5992000	I did see there was a Max 2 still there that it's sad.
5992000	5999000	Well, anyway, this mystery project is between Taito, who owns Space Invaders, and Dekika Games.
5999000	6000000	I hope I said that right.
6000000	6004000	And they say, if you've ever played a video game, then you likely have Taito to thank.
6004000	6006000	It's been four, that's a little.
6006000	6011000	But anyway, it's been 40 years since they've released their monumentally influential arcade title,
6011000	6014000	Space Invaders, an indisputable founding father of modern gaming.
6014000	6020000	To celebrate this occasion, Taito and Dekika are bringing the invasion to Steam in 2018.
6020000	6023000	Stay tuned for more details at the beginning of the new year.
6023000	6024000	They're so humble about it.
6024000	6026000	I know, right? They're so humble.
6026000	6029000	Maybe that's why they're going to Steam and not the Humble Bundle.
6029000	6032000	Anyway, I'm sure they'll sell it there too.
6032000	6034000	But yeah, so it'll be interesting to see what this is.
6034000	6035000	Yeah.
6035000	6040000	Yeah, probably going to be something that kind of just modernizes the shooter, kind of like Extreme.
6040000	6042000	But I hope the soundtrack is cool.
6043000	6047000	Yeah, actdeftinchat says, Space Invaders Extreme 3, please.
6047000	6054000	Tigerclaw says, the game I'm thinking of, Space Invaders Frenzy from Raw Thrills.
6054000	6058000	Who, Raw Thrills has been doing a lot of those reinvention games.
6058000	6060000	Aren't they the ones that are doing that Ninja Turtles arcade game too?
6060000	6061000	Yes.
6061000	6062000	Yeah, that whole thing. So they're doing a lot.
6062000	6064000	There it is. Yeah, this is it.
6064000	6067000	You have to see where you sit down, you have like the thing you point, it's crazy.
6067000	6070000	I bet you maybe this is something like they're going to try to make on Steam.
6070000	6072000	I don't know, something that's maybe a little more like...
6072000	6074000	So you actually like shoot stuff?
6074000	6076000	Yeah, you actually shoot them with like a gun.
6076000	6077000	Huh.
6077000	6078000	It's different, right?
6078000	6083000	That's the cool thing about these Space Invaders reimaginings is that many of them don't really stick to the old format.
6083000	6085000	So, anyway.
6085000	6086000	Cool.
6086000	6089000	Cool. Anyway, that's what I have to say about Space Invaders. Loki.
6089000	6092000	Alright, and then unfortunately some more bad news.
6093000	6107000	The voice actor, Jim French, has passed away. He was better known for some of the games he did voice work for for Valve, including Left 4 Dead, Left 4 Dead 2, and even Half-Life 2.
6108000	6111000	So, he did play Bill, I guess, in the Left 4 Dead series.
6111000	6116000	And in Half-Life 2, he played Father Grigori.
6116000	6123000	And I guess he also does the voice of Elder Titan in Dota 2, and the fisherman in Half-Life 2, Lost Coast.
6125000	6131000	And aside from that, he was also, you know, I guess a radio producer and a host for several years.
6131000	6140000	He created a show called Imagination Theater, I guess in Seattle's KIRO station, and later in KIXI.
6141000	6143000	So, he was 89 years old.
6143000	6148000	Well, that's a good age, but very sad to hear about that.
6149000	6156000	Lastly, tonight, end 2017. I thought maybe a little bit of music game news would be fun here.
6156000	6157000	Yes.
6158000	6162000	I don't know if there's anybody out there who wants to call in, but just in case we have anybody again on this early day.
6162000	6170000	If you do happen to be listening later in the evening at our usual time, you're hearing a rebroadcast because we did tape the show today at noon.
6170000	6174000	It's almost 2 o'clock on the West Coast now to free up our evenings.
6174000	6177000	But if you are listening live at the earlier time, you can give us a call.
6177000	6180000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
6180000	6182000	And you can say hello.
6182000	6184000	Otherwise, we'll probably be wrapping up soon.
6184000	6186000	But I did want to end it here on this note.
6186000	6189000	It's just kind of music game news, but a little iffy.
6189000	6203000	That is that MAME, the Multi Arcade Machine Emulator, controversial emulator, I'm sure, but it is worth reporting that MAME, the new version of MAME, will be supporting Beatmania.
6203000	6207000	Certain versions, 2DX specifically. I think the five keys are already supported.
6207000	6208000	Yeah.
6208000	6220000	But it will now support Beatmania 2DX 4th style, 6th style, 7th style, 8th style, Substream, and that's the one with DDR 2nd club.
6220000	6227000	Some other games worth mentioning, King of Fighters 98, Knights of Valor 2, New Legend, San Francisco Rush.
6227000	6228000	Rock sweet.
6228000	6230000	Wow, I'm almost more excited about that.
6230000	6231000	Yeah, exactly.
6231000	6233000	That game was awesome.
6233000	6234000	So there you go.
6234000	6242000	So that's kind of neat. Again, a little bit controversial because those games still kind of exist in many arcades, but those are some older versions.
6242000	6252000	And something to also think about, because it is an emulator, it's going to be a little slower, so your timing is going to really stink.
6252000	6256000	And working doesn't necessarily mean working greater.
6257000	6269000	What kind of specs do you need to run that kind of stuff? Because I remember trying to get Gauntlet Legends to work, you have to have a 4GHz processor or something ridiculous.
6269000	6277000	I used to do a lot more MAME than I do now, and usually they'd get released, but then they'd get optimized. It would take a little time, but they'd get faster.
6277000	6284000	And also, I've been doing MAME prior to them supporting multi-processors as well, so it may be a lot better now, who knows.
6284000	6292000	DarkTetsuya said, I played 2DX6 on it, it's still early, so there's some issues, but it still kind of works, but I figured you guys might appreciate this.
6292000	6298000	No, of course, it's a good note, but I'm bummed for us to end on here in 2017.
6298000	6302000	Alright, I'm going to do another shoutout for calls and see if we get anything.
6302000	6307000	OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype if anyone wants to get out their final thoughts for 2017.
6307000	6309000	So games we're anticipating playing in 2018?
6309000	6311000	The Bayonetta remakes.
6311000	6318000	I want to play Dance Rush whenever that gets brought out here, because I know they're doing location testing still.
6318000	6323000	But if it ever comes out here, which, that stuff tends to make its way to Dave and Busters.
6323000	6330000	I feel like next year might be the year for Kingdom Hearts III, finally. Fingers and toes crossed.
6330000	6332000	What do you think about Final Fantasy VII?
6332000	6338000	I think one or the other's got to happen next year. Maybe next year will be the Final Fantasy VII remake, and then next...
6338000	6341000	But the Final Fantasy VII remake's supposed to be episodic, too.
6341000	6343000	So I guess the first episode of that.
6343000	6345000	Yeah, maybe they'll both hit next year.
6345000	6348000	I wonder if Metroid's going to be the fourth quarter game.
6348000	6351000	I think Metroid will probably be next year. I don't think they want to announce it.
6351000	6352000	Smash Brothers, maybe?
6352000	6353000	Maybe.
6353000	6359000	Smash Brothers, I could see, is a game that they could wait to launch that online service for, because then it's like, you need to have this.
6359000	6366000	That could be, yeah. They'll probably put out a very powerful kind of game to go with that online service, that's for sure.
6366000	6369000	Supposed to. By then, it's probably not going to be all that hot.
6369000	6374000	DungeonBuster in chat says, Bayonetta 2 is definitely on the list for me. Never got to play it.
6374000	6381000	BobbyBlackWolf says, Final Fantasy VII Remake Episode 1 in December 2018. You don't think they'll aim for November?
6381000	6383000	Try to get the jump on...
6383000	6390000	I mean, I guess that stuff isn't as important as it used to be, but I would still think you'd try to get it out in November to get the jump on the holidays.
6390000	6392000	But it's not like...
6392000	6394000	Is Crackdown going to come out finally?
6394000	6397000	I think so, yeah. Crackdown is a game to look forward to next year.
6397000	6399000	Well, it's supposed to come out this year, too.
6399000	6402000	Yeah. I always forget about the Microsoft stuff. I know that's horrible.
6402000	6404000	But that's because they don't have anything.
6404000	6405000	Like, they used to have, like...
6405000	6407000	Sea Thieves looked interesting.
6407000	6409000	Oh, come on. No.
6409000	6410000	Wow.
6410000	6413000	No, no, they used to have, like, really big, like, releases.
6413000	6415000	Forza Horizon 4.
6415000	6416000	And now...
6416000	6417000	Hey, we gotta call. We gotta call. Let's get to it.
6417000	6419000	Hi, you're on Orange Taunt's radio. Who's this?
6419000	6420000	Hey, this, Act F.
6420000	6422000	Hey, Act F. What's on your mind, buddy?
6422000	6428000	Well, first of all, I really like that you enjoyed the gift I sent you.
6428000	6431000	We did. In fact, they're pretty much almost all gone at this point.
6431000	6436000	But we went all over. Like, I think Alan took a box to, like, a gallery meeting.
6436000	6438000	I don't know if Farzer's still at the house.
6438000	6440000	I know my wife was hoarding them, so...
6440000	6441000	What, did she like them?
6441000	6443000	I don't know if she's eaten them yet.
6443000	6446000	Yeah, the hazelnut stuff's really good. I'm sure Jamie ate all hers, too.
6446000	6448000	So, yeah, they're good stuff.
6448000	6451000	So, thank you for sending enough that we could all kind of share.
6451000	6452000	Hey, no problem.
6452000	6454000	Well, what's on your mind tonight?
6454000	6467000	Yeah, anyways, there's a bit of news in Mexico concerning video games, and it's not that great.
6467000	6468000	Uh-oh.
6469000	6482000	Basically, Mexico legislation just passed a law that has to regulate violent games.
6482000	6483000	Oh.
6483000	6492000	Yeah. And it's weird, because I'm not against it, because, well, yeah, we do have to regulate those things,
6492000	6498000	because you cannot sell, like, an M-rated game to a child and all that stuff.
6498000	6502000	We don't have, like, some... We use the ESRB, obviously.
6502000	6503000	Right.
6503000	6506000	But there's nothing that regulates it, so...
6506000	6512000	So, when we talk about regulating violent games, is it kind of like that law that the Supreme Court kind of flipped here?
6512000	6519000	In the U.S., the one that never really took place, where, like, a store can't even sell it without checking ID?
6519000	6522000	Or what do we mean when we say, like, regulating violent games?
6522000	6524000	Yeah, that's basically it.
6524000	6532000	You'll be ID'd if you want to buy an M-rated game, or a violent game.
6532000	6548000	And that's the thing. The legislation says they're gonna make, like, a new rating system, which is, like, really stupid,
6548000	6551000	because we already use the ESRB.
6551000	6556000	The ESRB, it's even in Spanish, so it's like, oh, I cannot read English.
6556000	6568000	No, it's in Spanish, too, so it's, like, really dumb that we're gonna use another, or have another, like, rating system, since it already exists, and we can use that.
6568000	6574000	Yeah. What do you know? Do you know the why? Like, why is this all happening?
6575000	6587000	Basically, the reasoning they have, it's because, oh, there's way, the people playing video games right now, it has tripled in amount,
6587000	6598000	and the majority of people are between the ages of 12 and 18, supposedly, and which I really, really don't believe it,
6598000	6611000	because consoles here are so way, way too expensive for, like, a 14-year-old to get, so I really don't believe the numbers.
6611000	6620000	I do understand the reasoning. Again, I'm not really against it, but it's, like, really dumb. They didn't think it through.
6620000	6624000	Well, for those that agree with you that it's dumb, is there anything at this point that can be done about it?
6625000	6634000	You know, I know here in the US, again, not to get too political or what have you, but I don't think it's any secret that, like, this year has been really hard on a lot of people,
6634000	6641000	because, you know, they may not agree with everything that's going on within the government, and it's caused a lot more people to get involved with politics,
6641000	6648000	and involved in that whole process. Do you think, I mean, is there an option for people in Mexico? Is there a way to get involved?
6648000	6655000	Is there a Supreme Court type of thing? I really, you know, I don't know. What could be done at this point, Akdev?
6655000	6670000	Well, it passed the House of Representatives, the equivalent of it, so it has to go through the Senate, and they can overturn it, or they can just say no, it cannot pass,
6670000	6680000	but at this point, I think it's gonna pass, even if people, like, start saying, oh, we don't want this, or can you modify it?
6680000	6691000	It's gonna be like, oh, it's gonna be there, and you cannot do anything about it. Mexican politics are, if you think the US politics are really, really...
6691000	6700000	I've heard, I've heard, yes. I've heard. Although, I do always get a kick out of what's-his-name, Vicente Fox, and his ramblings on Trump.
6700000	6710000	That's always a lot of fun, anyway. But, not to get too political. Well, Akdev, I'm sorry to hear that, you know, it may not be going so well, although there might be elements of that that you agree with,
6710000	6718000	but again, I would, even if it feels like there is no hope, I would encourage people to try to get involved with the political process. At least let the Senators know you disagree.
6718000	6723000	We do have elections, presidential elections this coming year, so yeah.
6723000	6728000	There you go, there's your way to have a say. Alright, my friend, well thank you for the update, I appreciate it, keep us posted, alright?
6728000	6741000	I especially want to know, like, ultimately what the impact is that it has on, like, going to actually buy a game, or if it kind of turns out that you, you know, decide maybe to get stuff from America and bring it in. Who knows? Who knows?
6741000	6747000	Yeah, most probably what I'm thinking is gonna happen, more people are gonna go digital here.
6747000	6752000	Ahh. Because, yeah, you cannot wriggle your debt. That's pretty much, like,
6752000	6758000	Very good point. Yeah, that's a way easy workaround on that, and that's got your games digitally, so,
6758000	6764000	That's a very good point, just go digital. Alright, Akdev, thank you so much for your support, and have a happy new year, okay?
6764000	6766000	Hey, you too. Alright, thanks buddy.
6766000	6767000	Thanks.
6768000	6776000	Alright, I don't think we have any other calls coming in, so I'm gonna go ahead and close up the Skype line there, but if you do have a thought you want to get out, you can always email us.
6776000	6783000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, and I think, do you have any last minute stories? I didn't ask.
6783000	6784000	No.
6784000	6791000	I figured as much. I figured it's probably time we wrap it up. I think, Josh is probably all done with Odyssey now. Did you get all the moons?
6791000	6792000	No.
6792000	6793000	No, okay.
6793000	6795000	I was just going through random.
6795000	6798000	He was just going through random. Don't forget to talk in the mic or the people can't hear you.
6798000	6801000	I was going through random.
6801000	6802000	Did you turn the mic off?
6802000	6803000	It's on, we can hear him.
6803000	6804000	Okay.
6804000	6805000	Go ahead, you were going through random.
6805000	6809000	I was going through random kingdoms.
6809000	6815000	Just random kingdoms. That's what I do too. I just, you know, what do I feel like doing today? That's a good way to do it.
6815000	6821000	Well, Josh, thank you for being here. Appreciate you being here. I know you didn't say a lot on the show, but we enjoyed hearing from you when we did.
6821000	6827000	So, we'll have you back in a couple years when you're ready to promote your YouTube channel, okay?
6827000	6828000	Alright.
6828000	6829000	Alright, sounds good.
6829000	6830000	Alright.
6830000	6831000	Yeah.
6831000	6832000	Yeah, good.
6832000	6837000	Alright, Loki, thanks as always for being here, my friend. Next year, year 16.
6837000	6838000	Yeah.
6838000	6842000	Old enough to drive here at Orange Lounge Radio. Play some games already.
6842000	6843000	I know.
6843000	6844000	Make a game already. Get on it.
6844000	6845000	I'll do it.
6845000	6846000	Alright, good job.
6846000	6847000	Any final thoughts?
6847000	6849000	Apparently our dryer's broken.
6849000	6850000	Woohoo!
6850000	6853000	So, fun never ends in 2017.
6853000	6855000	What a great start to the new year.
6855000	6856000	Your dryer broke?
6856000	6857000	Yes, our clothes dryer is broken.
6857000	6860000	You know what that means? You're gonna have to hang up all your clothes to dry them.
6860000	6863000	No, it means you're gonna take them over to my mother-in-law's house to dry them.
6863000	6865000	Well, how did it break?
6865000	6867000	It just, it's like...
6867000	6869000	Somebody took a ride in there.
6869000	6871000	It's like almost nine years old, so...
6871000	6878000	Alright, as always, I say, if you enjoy what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, please tell a friend or two about the show.
6878000	6883000	Help us spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, if the voices are actually here to be heard.
6883000	6887000	Otherwise, my final thought is, bring on the new year.
6887000	6891000	2017, I am done with you. Goodbye.
