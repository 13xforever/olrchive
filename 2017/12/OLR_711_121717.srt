Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Tonight we bring you the holiday joy of hopefulness, eagerness, and maybe a little bit of bitterness too, for what changes have happened and what's to come.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Join us for the week's gaming news and another day off the advent calendar, starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight, episode number 711, sorry, no free slurpees, for this December the 17th of 2017.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:56,000
My name, Rob Roberts, you might know me on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E, joining me, as always, say hello, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I need to get seven words out in the open.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Oh, is this going to be a George Carlin thing?

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's the new George Carlin thing.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Okay.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Because apparently number 45 dump has decided that people can't say these words, so we're getting into 1984 territory here.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Never one to shy away from political statements here on OLR.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Well, I call out garbage when garbage is there.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I understand, I understand.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So I'm going to say them now.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Please.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Fetus, diversity, vulnerable, entitlement, transgender, science-based, evidence-based.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Are these all things you got me for Christmas?

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I got you a fetus. I found it in the dumpster.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Because our regulations now on women's bodies are so terrible that women have to go and use coat hangers.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Anyway, believe it or not, it's a show about video games once in a while.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Well, you kind of did walk into that one.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I guess I did.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Anyway, happy Hanukkah, for what it's worth.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Thank you.

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Chag Sameach to you.

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Good shoe tie.

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
That's actually like pretty much what you say on a holiday.

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Is it? Okay.

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Chag Sameach.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Now, but if I remember correctly, and I come from a place of I don't really know, so just educate me if I need to be educated.

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
But my understanding is that like Christmas is like a big freaking deal to the people who celebrate Christmas, right?

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yeah.

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
But Hanukkah is like, it's a deal, but like it's not the Jewish holiday.

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
That would be like Rosh Hashanah, right?

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, those are the big ones.

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Okay.

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
This is more like so kids have a thing to not feel left out.

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Story time.

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
All right.

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Back in the day, and see now I'm also going to say this, this is the only Jewish holiday that is not in Torah.

44
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Okay.

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It was actually in an apocryphal book called The Book of Maccabees.

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So Christ lady, you're dumping politics and religion on me and having been five minutes in the show.

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So basically, the temple had been taken over, made into a place of pagan worship and Maccabees got their, you know, shit together, took the temple back.

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Quick version, right?

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
They only had enough oil for one night.

50
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Right.

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So they sent off for oil, but they made the oil last for eight nights.

52
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And that's the miracle of Hanukkah.

53
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Well, that's what you get for using Amazon these days because they never get their shit out on time.

54
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Girl.

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:09,000
But anyway, and I like the meme going around and say the modern equivalence is having, you know, one hour left on what being 1% on your phone and having it last for eight days.

56
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
That is a miracle.

57
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
That's a very modern way to explore.

58
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
That's how you explain it to a millennial.

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Put down the angry emails. I'm just being silly.

60
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,000
But the whole thing is that I'm sure Jewish kids felt left out that all of their little gentile friends were getting presents.

61
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So now it's kind of like a back to school holiday where people get pencils and like shirts and socks.

62
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Which you don't start to appreciate those things till later in life.

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I like socks.

64
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Like when I was younger, it was like, you know, socks and underwear, whatever.

65
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
But now that I'm, you know, more in my prime, I'm like, ooh, socks and underwear.

66
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Dude, I get giddy every time Daiso has socks because the Daiso, okay, this is my non endorsed endorsement of Daiso.

67
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Okay.

68
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The pile socks they have at Daiso are fucking comfortable as hell.

69
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm wearing my new pair with stars all over them.

70
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
They are pretty cute actually.

71
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And they're thick and cushy and I tear up socks really easily.

72
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And women's socks usually made like shit.

73
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
These are comfy.

74
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I will sleep in these suckers.

75
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
All right.

76
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So Daiso socks.

77
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Anyway, let's move on.

78
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Of course.

79
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Tech master Loki as well.

80
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Hello.

81
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Hello.

82
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Who is, who is downing a Slurpee here on the show?

83
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Did you bring enough for the whole class?

84
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
No, of course you didn't.

85
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
All right.

86
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
That's all right.

87
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
But you did bring other gifts.

88
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Can I open this?

89
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Yay.

90
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So it's a, it's a Christmas special.

91
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So I know I'm hearing that in chat, some of you are tuning out OLR live to go watch a Christmas story live.

92
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Come on.

93
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You've seen that.

94
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Well, you've seen technically it's based on the Broadway thing.

95
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's not.

96
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Oh yeah.

97
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So everybody's like, why would they remake the movie?

98
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Well, they're technically doing the Broadway version, which wasn't around very long.

99
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
But anyway, my point is you could have T vote that and listen to this.

100
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
No, I'm just kidding.

101
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Whatever you like what you like.

102
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
That's why we podcast this.

103
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Cause Sunday nights don't work for everybody, but I am going to open this.

104
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Okay.

105
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Have our own Christmas story right now.

106
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So I'm opening this.

107
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
What is, Ooh, is this like a puzzle?

108
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
What is this?

109
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
This is Ooh, what the hell?

110
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And Oh, there's actually like, Oh, Loki's a good guy and puts the receipt on there.

111
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Just in case I decide it's not for me.

112
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Drop mix.

113
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
What the wait a minute.

114
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I know this.

115
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
This was like a Kickstarter at one place.

116
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The harmonics thing.

117
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Right.

118
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Oh rad.

119
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And I have batteries for it too.

120
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Cause I love batteries.

121
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So tell me really quick.

122
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Like I sort of remember the Kickstarter for this.

123
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I don't know what the game's like.

124
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I tried it at the store one time and he basically put cards down and it reads them and it makes

125
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
music.

126
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Okay.

127
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Somehow.

128
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Yeah.

129
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And they actually has music from a fallout boy.

130
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Imagine dragons.

131
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Oh, thank God.

132
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
There's a, this is a religious holiday after all.

133
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
There is Carly Rae Jepsen included in this as well.

134
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Carly slay Jesus.

135
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And I'm so happy.

136
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
All right.

137
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
That's great.

138
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Fantastic.

139
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Thank you, Loki.

140
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
That's very nice of you.

141
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
No problem.

142
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
All right.

143
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Oh.

144
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And now dark.

145
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Oh fuck.

146
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
And I'm looking in chat at live.vognore.com.

147
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
This is Joe.

148
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
And her mat says drop mix is really cool.

149
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Vid power says it's really well done.

150
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
That's awesome.

151
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Yay.

152
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Don't throw the bag away.

153
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I have portal.

154
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,000
The uncooperative cake acquisition game with the steam code for portal two.

155
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So if any friends would like to have a steam code for portal two and play with me.

156
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Ooh, steam card.

157
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Yay.

158
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Thank you.

159
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Now you can buy portal three J K J K.

160
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
They can't count.

161
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Well, technically it's a new game because it's a board.

162
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
No, I love it.

163
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It's very, uh, if you haven't seen the box for this, it's very like plain 1960s generic

164
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
box.

165
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And it does say in like a very plain font portal cake acquisition game.

166
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
So that's great.

167
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I love it.

168
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Let me see what the ours look like.

169
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Uh, aha.

170
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
We have some rather tightly kerned, um, uh, Helvetica.

171
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Great.

172
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
And actually there are some games on my steam wishlist that this will come in handy for.

173
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Loki, you bought me a game on steam as well.

174
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Like as if this drop mix wasn't awesome enough.

175
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
What was the game you bought on steam and why did you pick this?

176
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Um, we can actually get to video games at some point tonight.

177
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's called getting over it and it's because it's incredibly frustrating and it's a good

178
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
streaming game because, because it's fun to watch people play it cause it's incredibly

179
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
frustrating.

180
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
And I've been really, really slacking on my streaming, but I really, really am going to

181
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
try to get back into doing that regularly.

182
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Just not tonight cause I have company visiting.

183
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
So, uh, welcome back to the show here at orange on trade.

184
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Oh, he's been on the show like a bunch this year and he's back one more time for our last

185
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
live show of 2017.

186
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Say hello to JD.

187
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Hi.

188
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Hi.

189
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
How are you?

190
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm doing pretty good.

191
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Yeah.

192
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Great.

193
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
So we went on Pokemon adventures today.

194
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You want to talk about that for a little bit?

195
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Um, sure.

196
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You've been playing more poke, like Pokemon go cause nobody plays it anymore.

197
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Right?

198
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I mean, I play it when I come to Sacramento.

199
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You've been playing, you've been playing at home too, haven't you?

200
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Cause some very nice guy gave you a clicker thing, his old clicker thing and you're playing

201
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
it more.

202
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Right?

203
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Yeah.

204
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Yeah.

205
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Um, but yeah, it's been good to get like the, the GPS credit for like walking around because

206
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
that was one of the biggest obstacles to me playing was like Pokemon go, like having it

207
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
in the foreground of my phone takes forever and I can't do anything else.

208
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And so now I can like do other stuff on my phone.

209
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
That's really the best part of the Pokemon go Bluetooth devices, be it an official device

210
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
or something like that.

211
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Yeah.

212
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Yeah.

213
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Yeah.

214
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Yeah.

215
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
That's really the best part of the Pokemon go Bluetooth devices, be it an official plus

216
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
or a gotcha is the walking credit.

217
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I really is the best.

218
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Yeah.

219
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
So awesome.

220
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Yes.

221
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Star.

222
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Sorry.

223
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I actually use when I take a walk at work, I turn on Pokemon go on my Apple watch.

224
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Oh yeah.

225
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I always, depending on where I'm walking, I either play Pokemon go.

226
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
If it's not a place I can really play ingress or I play ingress.

227
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
If I intentionally drove to a park to pew, pew, pew laser beams.

228
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
And sometimes you do both at the same time.

229
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I thankfully with the iPhone 10 I can kind of do both.

230
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I can Bluetooth with Pokemon and I can pew pew laser beams with ingress.

231
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So it just kind of depends on the situation.

232
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
So heaven forbid when Niantic launches that third game, Harry Potter wizards unite because

233
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
then I'm going to have to make some tough choices because luckily that Draconis go was

234
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
kind of choosing a house isn't hard enough.

235
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Yeah, I know.

236
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I know.

237
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
No, no.

238
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
That part's easy.

239
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Slytherin for life.

240
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Slytherin.

241
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I'm easy.

242
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'm kind of torn between Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw.

243
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
When your favorite drag queen is Alaska, you're going to pick Slytherin, right?

244
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Cause you already speak parcel tongue.

245
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
That's right.

246
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Exactly.

247
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And there's like only three listeners that are going to understand that.

248
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I think that you're a cuddly, adorable Hufflepuff.

249
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Another problem, see with playing Pokemon go recently is that we're just too extreme

250
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
for Pokemon go.

251
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Yeah.

252
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
What the hell is that about?

253
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It's extreme weather.

254
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Oh my God.

255
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
There's clouds outside.

256
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So right now here, our show is based in lovely Sacramento, California.

257
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And right now you just brought up Pokemon go this moment.

258
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
We're getting an extreme weather alert.

259
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Yes.

260
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Extreme weather because it's chilly outside, like not cold, but kind of chilly.

261
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And there's a few slight clouds.

262
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
So here's the thing.

263
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Apparently that is tied to official weather alerts.

264
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
So when you see that extreme alert,

265
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I just pull up the weather channel app or whatever weather channel thing you want

266
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
to use.

267
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Boy, I just really plugged the weather channel, didn't I?

268
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I guess I hope for a kickback.

269
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
But anyway, I see the alert and here's the thing.

270
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
There is an alert, a special weather statement until Monday, 6 AM.

271
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
So we're going to be locked.

272
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Well, you're not locked out of Pokemon go, but no bonus, no bonus for you and

273
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Pokemon go.

274
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You want stardust?

275
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You can't have it.

276
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
So no stardust and Pokemon go until Monday, 6 AM,

277
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
because here's the official notice.

278
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Rain and lower elevation,

279
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
mountain snow late Tuesday night and Wednesday,

280
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
a weak storm system will move across the region Tuesday night and Wednesday.

281
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
This is a fucking alert for Tuesday and Wednesday about a weak ass storm

282
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
system.

283
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It says in the did not say a weak storm system.

284
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You know what I'm looking forward to?

285
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
What?

286
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
So I live in San Francisco in the summer.

287
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Sometimes it gets a little warm for us.

288
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
So the national weather service will issue heat alerts when it gets to be

289
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
about 80 Fahrenheit.

290
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
So because it actually is a problem there.

291
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
If you don't have air conditioning,

292
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
like 80 is actually harmful for the elderly,

293
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
but it's like for everyone else, it's like, okay,

294
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
it's going to be a little warm,

295
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
but that's probably going to do the same thing in Pokemon go.

296
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It's going to shut off and it's like, Oh no, it's too hot.

297
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Here's my suggestion for Niantic on how to fix this because a lot of the

298
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
players are kind of irritated at this because the weather system is actually

299
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
really awesome because it has really mixed up the types of Pokemon that you

300
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
see. Like I'm seeing way different stuff now with, you know, when it's,

301
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
you know, sunny and cloudy and all that stuff.

302
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
But this kind of puts a big stink on the whole thing.

303
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
But my suggestion for Niantic is you need to filter the title of these alerts

304
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
and look for severe weather statement.

305
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Yeah.

306
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
That would be the stuff that would be hurricanes.

307
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Tornado, blizzard.

308
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Well, honestly, if you do severe weather statement,

309
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I think anything that falls in that category is going to do that.

310
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
But you need to filter out these. That's a cautionary statement.

311
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It really makes me wonder just how sophisticated the API is because I'm sure

312
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
that's got to be part of it.

313
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It's not.

314
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Plot twist.

315
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Well, there you go.

316
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Anyway, the last break band in our chat at live.vognetwork.com says,

317
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
What the fuck? The weather people in California sound bored.

318
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Yeah, kinda. Sometimes.

319
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Anyway, I should introduce I should give our chat room a proper introduction.

320
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Hello, guys.

321
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
We do tape live, of course, every Sunday nights at the voice geeks network

322
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
vognetwork.com 6 o'clock Pacific 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby

323
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Black Wolf show.

324
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
And that's where you guys are chatting along with our show right now.

325
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Tiger Claw points out, guys, today is the 30th anniversary of Mega Man.

326
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It came out on December 17th, 1987.

327
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
How about that?

328
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Mega Man is officially 30 years old today.

329
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
And I would have made a lame joke about how Capcom has pretty much, you know,

330
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
kicked Mega Man to the curb.

331
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
But Mega Man 11 kind of saved the day, didn't it?

332
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
And now we're going to Mega Man X collection.

333
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
So I can't really talk shit about Capcom right now with Mega Man.

334
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
So let me ask this.

335
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Favorite Mega Man stage in any game.

336
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
You can do X if you want.

337
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Favorite Mega Man stage in any game.

338
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
That's going to be a little bit difficult because it's kind of like my least

339
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
favorite and most favorite.

340
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
And that's the Mega Dragon in Mega Man 2.

341
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Okay.

342
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
So you're picking Wily's Castle part one.

343
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Yeah.

344
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Part two.

345
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Sorry.

346
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Wily's Castle into part one.

347
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Yes.

348
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
No, not part one.

349
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
It was part one.

350
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It was part one.

351
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
The dragon was the boss of part one.

352
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
No, never mind.

353
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Because two is when you fall down.

354
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
And anyway.

355
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I like that one too.

356
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Yeah.

357
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I just pretty much like the whole Wily stage in two.

358
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
They have the same music.

359
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
That's what you can use.

360
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
So anyway.

361
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
But that's your favorite?

362
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Yeah, that dragon's pretty bad.

363
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Pretty much the whole Wily stage.

364
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Yeah.

365
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I would say.

366
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Okay.

367
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,840
Because I had that whole thing down to a science.

368
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:49,840
And I used to be able to do that level blindfolded.

369
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,900
What about you, JD?

370
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:54,660
So I'm going to have to admit, I'm going to need to buy this collection of all the Mega

371
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,660
Man games.

372
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,660
Because you haven't played any?

373
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,000
Because I don't think I've ever beaten a Mega Man game.

374
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,340
That's okay if you haven't beaten one.

375
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,340
They're kind of hard.

376
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,420
I played some of them when I was in elementary school.

377
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,140
Do you remember any of them?

378
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,540
Usually the one that comes to mind first.

379
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:09,060
I remember the names of some of them, but I haven't really sat down and gone through

380
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,060
a level.

381
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,060
Okay.

382
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,060
Like, I've watched other people play.

383
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,060
You ignorant child.

384
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,060
I'm just kidding.

385
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,220
Well, I mean, Mega Man is only six months younger than me.

386
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,740
Shut up.

387
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,740
Alright.

388
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,940
Loki, how about you?

389
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:21,940
Favorite Mega Man?

390
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:22,940
I don't know.

391
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:25,100
It's been so long since I played those.

392
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,100
Probably.

393
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,100
That's easy for me.

394
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:32,100
I like when you have to go back in number two to fight some of the bosses from number

395
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,100
one.

396
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,100
That's kind of fun.

397
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,100
But there's like four stages for that.

398
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,100
That doesn't happen.

399
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,100
That's me.

400
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,100
You're thinking Mega Man three.

401
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,100
You go back and fight Mega Man two.

402
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,100
You sure?

403
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,100
Yeah.

404
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,100
I thought that was in two.

405
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,100
Chatters?

406
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,100
Am I wrong?

407
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,100
Because you have to fight Metal Man again.

408
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,100
Nope.

409
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,100
In two.

410
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,100
You have to go back and fight.

411
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,100
In fact, this is in every Mega Man game.

412
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,780
You have to go back and fight all the bosses again from the same game that you're in.

413
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:52,780
Right.

414
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:53,780
For the same game.

415
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,940
I thought they had the ones from number one in there as well.

416
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:56,940
No.

417
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:58,780
In three, you went back and fought the bosses in two.

418
00:14:58,780 --> 00:14:59,780
Oh.

419
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:00,780
And they redid.

420
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,780
They alter some of the stages, the corner stages, and you do like two bosses.

421
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,780
Yeah.

422
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,780
I remember that.

423
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,780
Okay.

424
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,780
Well.

425
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:08,780
I guess I'm the only one that remembers these games.

426
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,780
Jesus.

427
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:10,780
All right.

428
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:11,780
No, it's fine.

429
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:12,780
Girl.

430
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:13,780
Let's see.

431
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,780
Okay.

432
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:15,780
So my favorite, easy, hands down, Elec Man.

433
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:16,780
It's because of the music in the original Mega Man game.

434
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,780
It's my favorite music in any stage is Elec Man.

435
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,260
She's a really good sound designer.

436
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,260
Really good composer.

437
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,260
Oh, yeah.

438
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,260
Oh, yeah.

439
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,260
She was amazing.

440
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,260
Well, she didn't die.

441
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,900
She has a new album coming out soon.

442
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:26,900
She does.

443
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,860
She is amazing.

444
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:29,860
She is a good composer.

445
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:30,860
Yes.

446
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:31,860
Yes.

447
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:32,860
I'm just giving you crap.

448
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:33,860
Isn't that what I said?

449
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,860
Our word wasn't me.

450
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:35,860
Well, you said was.

451
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:36,860
I was like, well, she didn't die.

452
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,980
She was a mag fest the last time I went.

453
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:39,980
So yeah.

454
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,420
I do know the music from Mega Man well enough because that's like everywhere.

455
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,420
Okay.

456
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,420
So what's your favorite Mega Man song?

457
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,420
Well, I don't know the names.

458
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,420
I just hear them on radio.

459
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,420
Oh, Jesus.

460
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,420
Bubble Man's the same.

461
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,420
Just say Bubble Man.

462
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,420
Or say, what's another popular one?

463
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,420
I'm trying to think of the popular one.

464
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,420
Crash Bandicoot.

465
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,420
Crash Man.

466
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,420
Crash Man.

467
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:57,940
Anyway.

468
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:58,940
All right.

469
00:15:58,940 --> 00:15:59,940
Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

470
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,940
Quick Man's music was rad.

471
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:05,700
Dark Tetsuya says, I think three was my favorite of the series.

472
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,660
Black Wolf says, my favorite thing about Mega Man is the Megas.

473
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:11,740
Vid Power says Air Man's song is a great song.

474
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,740
That was, you know what?

475
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:15,780
Air Man's stage was the first stage I ever played in any Mega Man game.

476
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:16,780
And I remember that.

477
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:19,620
They always would tell people to start with Air Man and I never would.

478
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,460
I'd always start with Metal Man.

479
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,460
Yes.

480
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:25,780
There's kind of two loops through the game and you can start with Air Man, but I agree.

481
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,420
Metal Man, I think is easier to start with.

482
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:33,700
And don't forget, we got from that game, Air Man got Taos and I.

483
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,700
Okay.

484
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,300
Let's embarrass ourselves in front of the listeners.

485
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,300
You ready?

486
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,300
Do you remember?

487
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,300
Okay.

488
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,300
Starting with Metal Man.

489
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,300
Do you remember Love?

490
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,300
That's my cross.

491
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:46,460
Do you remember the path through Mega Man to what bosses to do in what order?

492
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,700
Starting with whatever you want.

493
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:52,020
I would always do them a little bit out of order because I would always do Mega Man,

494
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:56,460
Flash Man and Flash Man just because you can always use the weapon.

495
00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:01,980
And then I would do Air Man and then I would go do Quick Man with Flash Man's weapon.

496
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:08,140
And then I would do Heat Man with Quick Man.

497
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,740
I don't know.

498
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:10,740
That's right.

499
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,740
No.

500
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,740
I would do Bubble Man.

501
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,260
I would just beat everybody with the metal blades anyway.

502
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,100
You just kick all their asses.

503
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,380
You just beat them with the metal blades anyway.

504
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,420
It doesn't matter because they shoot diagonal.

505
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,420
Let's see.

506
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:25,860
I always started with Metal Man and then Metal Man to Flash Man, Flash Man to Quick Man,

507
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,420
Quick Man to...

508
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,340
Yeah, this is where I get stuck too.

509
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,540
I can't remember what Quick Man worked well on.

510
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,540
Was it...

511
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,580
Bubble Man?

512
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,580
Was it Bubble Man?

513
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,580
I don't know.

514
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:39,100
Because that would make sense because the bubble is what you use on Heat.

515
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,100
Heat is Wood Man.

516
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,820
You can kill Wood Man with one super fire shot.

517
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:43,820
Wood Man is Air Man.

518
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,180
Air Man is Crash Man.

519
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:47,860
You need the bubble lead for the final wily fight.

520
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:48,860
I think that's it.

521
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:49,860
Did I name eight?

522
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,860
I think I just named the path through the game.

523
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,740
And you need the bubble lead to beat two.

524
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,300
Well, yeah, yeah, that's the super weapon at the end.

525
00:17:56,300 --> 00:18:00,700
And in three it's the top man, which was otherwise fucking useless.

526
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,700
Alright.

527
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:05,820
Chatter's agree, it was Bubble Man after Quick Man.

528
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:06,820
That's what I thought.

529
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:07,820
Alright.

530
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,820
So I sort of remembered.

531
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:09,820
Yay.

532
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:10,820
Alright.

533
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,820
Let's get into the real kickoff topic for tonight.

534
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:16,580
I mean, Mega Man, celebrating that is always fun, but it just goes to show our live chatters

535
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:19,700
will derail this show at any moment for any reason.

536
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:24,620
So anyway, I want to go to, I want to talk about this because this is a controversial

537
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,740
topic around this week.

538
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:28,700
You know, this is usually the time of year when the gaming news slows down, but this

539
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,700
year's been kind of different.

540
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,980
Like, I feel like we've still got a lot of stuff to talk about tonight.

541
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:38,020
Starting with this, and it has to do with something that the creator of PUBG, which

542
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:42,260
I sometimes call Pugbee, which I know is out of order, but pugs are cute, which of course

543
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,400
I'm talking about Player Unknown Battlegrounds.

544
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,380
And Brendan Greene is the creator of this game.

545
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:51,280
And a little statement that he made is kind of floating around the blogs this week.

546
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,540
And it's kind of, you know, I don't, I don't know how much of this, this guy kind of like

547
00:18:54,540 --> 00:19:00,580
truly feels or how much is kind of a shaped quote to make articles sound clicky.

548
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:06,660
But anyway, apparently what's going on is that he's not too big on copycats of PUBG.

549
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:12,260
And I don't think this is so much about, cause we know a few months ago or maybe even less

550
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:15,940
than that, there was a little bit of a hubbub with Fortnite.

551
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:19,220
And you know, I don't think they were feeling too great about that, but I don't think this

552
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,460
is what he's addressing here.

553
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:24,860
He's talking a little bit more about, you go to like some of the mobile phone fronts,

554
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:29,180
especially like China, you're going to see shit where they have just like straight up

555
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:35,140
downloaded the assets, the maps, you know, they've basically ripped off the game.

556
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:39,980
So anyway, he didn't drop any names when he was talking about what his problems was, were

557
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:40,980
though.

558
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:44,500
But Brendan, the creator of PUBG said, I want other developers to put their own spin on

559
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,560
the game, not just lift things from our game.

560
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:51,020
And this came from an interview he did with BBC Radio 1.

561
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:55,180
In movies and music, there is IP production and you can really look after your work.

562
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:58,660
In gaming, that doesn't exist yet and it's something that could be, should be looked

563
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,660
into.

564
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:06,220
But didn't he rip his game off of H1Z1 King of the Kill, I mean, it's basically the same

565
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,220
game.

566
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,820
Yeah, I mean, there you go.

567
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:09,820
Now he did.

568
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:12,740
I just, I like people preaching like, oh, it should be this way.

569
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:15,300
You're fucking guilty of the same shit.

570
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:19,420
He did say, though, that he's not trying to shut down anyone who copies elements from

571
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,980
his game, but he wants the genre to grow.

572
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:24,640
And that's only going to happen when developers find new ways to do things.

573
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:30,860
And he said in this quote, for the genre to grow, you need new and interesting spins on

574
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,860
the game mode.

575
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:37,400
If it just copycats down the line, then the genre doesn't grow and people get bored.

576
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:43,320
So and apparently it was called out that some of the PUBG clones in China, they're everywhere

577
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,320
and there are problems.

578
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,320
Yeah, that's China.

579
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,320
Well, right.

580
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:52,280
And China has rampant IP theft because it's China and it's not the US.

581
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,480
There's not a lot you can do really with that type of stuff.

582
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:02,020
But usually the quality of said games kind of travels around and we kind of know that,

583
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,480
you know, they're to stay away from.

584
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,080
And this isn't exactly a new thing either, right?

585
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:12,280
Like haven't we heard like of the Final Fantasy 7 on the NES that was like a hacked ROM thing?

586
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:16,320
Like even more modern, like, you know, there's Overwatch has probably had some stuff.

587
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,320
Oh, God.

588
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,320
Several.

589
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,320
Oh, sure.

590
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,320
Sure.

591
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,320
Of course.

592
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,320
Yeah.

593
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,320
And then they'll just take those straight up steal the Overwatch characters and put

594
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,520
them in other games.

595
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,520
Sometimes that can be funny, though.

596
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,400
Wasn't there also like a Pokemon Go clone that somebody made?

597
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:33,400
Well, there's that whole Draconis thing that I played for like a week, which is interesting.

598
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:38,680
But the interesting thing about that, even though, like, it's totally like a copy of

599
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:44,040
Pokemon Go from about a year ago, like, what's weird is that they stole that.

600
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:47,060
And then they but they did all new monsters and that whole thing.

601
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:52,080
But then they kind of like added new shit like they were like, but now we have PvP and

602
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,280
we have these portals that you can travel to to go to the underworld, which is just

603
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,920
the same world, but it's a different color.

604
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,480
It's like the upside down and stranger things or something, right?

605
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,480
It's actually kind of cool.

606
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,920
Yeah, no, it's actually kind of cool.

607
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:07,840
It's just because it's very clear that this was an outsourced developed game.

608
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,600
It kind of it's not very well optimized and it kind of feels cheapy.

609
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:16,160
But some people kind of prefer it to Pokemon Go.

610
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:21,200
I don't because there's no Bluetooth and Pikachu is way cuter than Potty, which, yes, one of

611
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,880
the one of the monsters Draconis is called Potty.

612
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,420
It's a little it's a little fire pot.

613
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,840
That's why he's called Potty.

614
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:32,960
But I don't know if the developers realize that a potty is also something you go poo

615
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,460
poo in.

616
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:37,880
So I don't I don't know if they realize that when they translated it.

617
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,640
Does it evolve from squatty?

618
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:45,280
You'd have to ask the RuPaul podcast about that, because that's not something we pitch

619
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,280
here.

620
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,280
All right.

621
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,280
Anyway.

622
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,320
Well, what do you guys think, Loki?

623
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,320
What do you think?

624
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,320
What do you think?

625
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:57,760
Because my mind went to the whole like I know this is like years old here on O.L.R., but

626
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,700
we did talk many years ago about the whole debate.

627
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,920
Remember when In the Groove came out?

628
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:06,680
Was that basically a theft of DDR?

629
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:10,160
And years later, probably a couple of years ago at this point.

630
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,160
But we actually had, you know, Kyle Ward, who was a big part of In the Groove, actually

631
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:17,760
came on this show and we kind of got to hear it from the other side, because, you know,

632
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,340
I'm not going to lie about what happened at the time.

633
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:23,080
I wasn't very keen on In the Groove.

634
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:27,880
I did kind of feel like it was jacking a lot from DDR at the time.

635
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:31,000
But then, you know, years pass, you get older, sometimes your mind's changed.

636
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,920
And I also see where In the Groove was kind of trying to fill a gap that Konami was leaving

637
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,920
out there.

638
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:43,400
And, you know, and I always kind of think the biggest mistake that game made was releasing

639
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:47,560
on PlayStation 2, because when they were in the arcades, they weren't really infringing

640
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,480
on Konami's turf because those games weren't legal here.

641
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,240
But when they released on PS2, that was the big thing that allowed Konami to to smack

642
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,240
it down.

643
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,520
Anyway, I don't mean to rehash that whole thing because, well, because, again, I think

644
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:04,560
if you ask me now how I feel about it, I think my answer would be different than what I would

645
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:09,420
have said 10 years ago when I was like, yeah, 10 years ago I said, yeah, it's just it's

646
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,420
not as good.

647
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,420
It's a copy of a copy or whatever.

648
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:15,280
But now, like kind of looking back, I kind of go, well, you know what?

649
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:18,920
Somebody had to do something because Konami was going to let that genre die.

650
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:23,480
And so I kind of give props to them for trying to do something.

651
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:27,840
I mean, I remember being kind of mad in 2006, but a lot of that was I was mad at Konami

652
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,720
and it was coming out at being mad at Rockstar.

653
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,200
Like that's like that filter kind of a thing, you know.

654
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,440
So yeah, I hear you here.

655
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:43,200
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,

656
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,760
use the passphrase sister.

657
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,640
Well, anyway, that's that's years ago.

658
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,640
What do you think?

659
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,640
Fast forwarding to now.

660
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,320
But I can't help but see things in that perspective, right?

661
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:55,860
Is that I feel like this debate we've kind of had before, but something that was very

662
00:24:55,860 --> 00:25:00,200
fascinating from that, you know, Kyle interview and some folks in chat are saying, bring him

663
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,200
back, bring him back.

664
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,080
If he has something to promote, which he does with that StepMania X thing, I'm sure at some

665
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,080
point we will have him back.

666
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,220
And he's always welcome back on the show.

667
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:11,000
But if you haven't heard that interview and you're a music game fan, like even though

668
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,960
the episode is like two, three years old at this point, go fucking listen to it, because

669
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,960
we learned a lot about the fucking iron grip that Konami had on that whole genre.

670
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,960
It's from 2015.

671
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,640
I want to say August.

672
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,200
It was whatever year I went to PAX East, because that's when we connected.

673
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,380
I'm sure if you search the wiki for Kyle Ward, you'll find it.

674
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:32,560
Is there a wiki for Orange Lounge Radio?

675
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,280
Oh, yeah, there's a wiki for Orange Lounge Radio.

676
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,280
I don't know if that is.

677
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,280
Oh, yeah, probably.

678
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,280
Of course it is.

679
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,980
There's the page that has all the episode summaries.

680
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,800
So you can search the wiki for that.

681
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,800
You're right.

682
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,800
Thank you.

683
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,640
But anyway, so that's that's old, but I can't help but reference that.

684
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,040
But going back to the new Loki, do you think what do you think?

685
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:55,040
Does PUBG need to chill a little bit here or do they kind of you know, there are a lot

686
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,840
of rip offs in China, actually.

687
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,840
What do you think?

688
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,400
Well, that's just a given that there's going to be rip offs of that.

689
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:05,560
I think it's not necessarily him complaining about rip offs from China because there's

690
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,560
that.

691
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:11,540
But I think he's concerned that people are ripping them off, like in other games, like

692
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:16,580
because Grand Theft Auto had their kind of PUBG type game and then they added that mode

693
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,580
to, you know, Fortnite.

694
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:21,620
And I think he's feeling like, well, that was my original idea.

695
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:24,540
And now everybody's getting a piece of the pie, too.

696
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:31,940
You know, I just find that just very elitist that he would consider that he started this

697
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:34,580
genre of game because I'm sorry, you didn't.

698
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:41,100
I mean, it's fucking battle royale, like all these games have done this shit before.

699
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,940
You just have a popular, you have the current popular version.

700
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:48,020
It's back when, remember, like even if you want to go back further, it's where they tried

701
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:52,900
to copy, say they copyrighted a genre like Street Fighter versus Mortal Kombat.

702
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:56,460
You know, well, who owns the fighting game genre?

703
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:01,140
You know, somebody, oh, that's just a Street Fighter clone or that's a Doom clone.

704
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:05,020
There's going to be, it's a genre now and that's, you're just going to be used to the

705
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:07,060
fact that there's going to be competition.

706
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,680
You know what's funny when you talk about the genre is because maybe for somebody like

707
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:15,280
me who doesn't always get into these types of games, I just go, it's a first person shooter

708
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,280
game.

709
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:21,080
I think for a lot of people out there, chatters, am I wrong?

710
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:25,960
Does anybody else feel this way that like, if you haven't read a lot about PUBG or whatever,

711
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:30,000
you kind of look at it and go, oh, it looks like a counter strikey call of duty kind of

712
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
thing.

713
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I don't know if I'm into that.

714
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,840
I mean, that's basically my take on the game.

715
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,840
Thank you.

716
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,840
I know.

717
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,160
There are PUBG fans who are going to hear that and go, what a bunch of idiots.

718
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:45,360
But I'm sorry, that's, you know, until you take the deep dive into kind of looking at

719
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,800
that game a little more, that's, it just looks like another pew pew shooty shooty game.

720
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,840
I mean, to be fair, I pretty much exclusively don't play shooters.

721
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,280
The most I'll do is Portal or Splatoon.

722
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,880
But I see, I'm in this weird place where I can kind of say that I don't usually get into

723
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,920
like Call of Duty type of games, but like Destiny's rad, Overwatch is cool.

724
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:09,080
And I do actually understand the difference between what PUBG is and, you know, Fortnite

725
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,080
and all this stuff.

726
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:15,000
I do understand the battle royale genre, but I know there was a certain period of time

727
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,960
when I wasn't as well versed on what PUBG was where I was kind of like, oh, it's just

728
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,760
another shooty game I'll probably just won't get into.

729
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,240
And I still haven't gotten into it.

730
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:27,200
But I mean, anything with real time aiming, it's like it's its own genre kind of thing.

731
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,540
Like shooting arrows in Zelda can be problematic for me because it's still like you have to

732
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,060
hit things and they're moving.

733
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,860
And I have trouble with that.

734
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,640
Going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

735
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:42,740
First off, the super sleuths in the chat, we've been referencing episode number 596.

736
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:46,760
So you can Google Orange On Radio 596 from May 3rd, 2015.

737
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,760
So there it is.

738
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,460
Anyway, thank you, guys.

739
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:54,780
Also, let's see in chat, Ragenator says over at live.vognetwork.com, I was going to reference

740
00:28:54,780 --> 00:29:01,060
the fact that before the term first person shooter was coined, all FPSs were called Doom

741
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,060
Jones.

742
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,760
Yeah, I remember that for a bit, too.

743
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:11,220
But even when Doom first came out, oh, it's Wolfenstein.

744
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:17,020
But in more three dimensions, because Wolfenstein was really kind of a 2D game in a 3D space.

745
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:20,500
I know that sounds weird to say, but like if you go into the map editor, the map editor

746
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,420
is like pure 2D.

747
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,420
It's blocks, right?

748
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:27,740
But I know and not everybody's going to agree with what I just said.

749
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:28,740
That's fine.

750
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,740
Let's see.

751
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:34,380
Dungeon Buster in chat says I might not have to deal with China, but they didn't flip out

752
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:37,560
when Doom killers and clones eventually came out.

753
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,740
They just upped their tech in response.

754
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,260
There you go.

755
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:44,460
Bobby Blackwell points out the Doom added elevation, but you still couldn't look up

756
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:45,460
or down.

757
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,460
So, whatever.

758
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:49,740
I played Duke Nukem 3D anyway, which was totally different, right?

759
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,360
Duke Nukem 3D was a totally different game.

760
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,660
Has my favorite quote in it.

761
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:53,660
What, your face, your ass?

762
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,660
Your face, your ass.

763
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,660
What's the difference?

764
00:29:56,660 --> 00:30:04,420
I had that as a WAV file I would play in the old AOL chat rooms, which by the way, R-A-P-AOL.

765
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:06,060
Rest in peace AOL Instant Messenger.

766
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,060
You're right.

767
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,060
That was something that happened this week.

768
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:15,580
I had all of my usernames that I had as AOL accounts in AIM and I met my husband that

769
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,580
way.

770
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:23,460
I made a lot of friends who became my con buddies and I had friends in the Bay Area

771
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,420
before I had ever set foot in the Bay Area.

772
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,940
So it's just, yeah, R-A-P-AOL.

773
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:32,260
I definitely did a lot of chatting through AIM, you know, probably when Alan and I first

774
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:35,660
got together, it was a lot of, it was all chatting with live journal friends on AIM.

775
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:39,500
And sometimes I was playing the survivor games and big brother games on live journal.

776
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:44,220
It was all through AIM and now they all moved to Facebook a few years ago.

777
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,220
So yeah.

778
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:52,740
But when AOL back in the day extended their screen names from 10 letters to 15, I was

779
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:55,040
the first person to take Queen Emeraldus.

780
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,040
Thank you.

781
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,040
What do you want?

782
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,040
A cookie?

783
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,040
Yes.

784
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,040
I would really like a cookie.

785
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:03,160
Well, I was the first person that had mad tea party 78 because that was my name.

786
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,640
I can say that now because it's not like you message me.

787
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,960
So there you go.

788
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,680
All right.

789
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,680
What was my other?

790
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,680
I don't remember.

791
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,000
I had, I had like five.

792
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,840
I had Majin Bura for the longest time.

793
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,840
Didn't you just have dark Sakura?

794
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:23,420
I had dark Sakura for ages too, but I was Majin Bura before that on AOL.

795
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:27,860
And then I had, I had like one for sailor aluminum siren.

796
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:33,820
And then, um, but I also had dark Ukyo cause Dan had dark Ryoga.

797
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:37,380
See, I was on Prodigy before AOL.

798
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:42,380
So we called it Buttigy.

799
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:46,540
But well it was, it was Buttigy when I ran up that $70 bill or whatever it was using

800
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,540
chat rooms.

801
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,540
Yes.

802
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,540
Prodigy.

803
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:52,960
I remember that I was, we were, I was messing with a friend and we were trying to submit

804
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,600
like a stupid joke to their joke, like forum website thing or something like that.

805
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,760
And that like costs like $60.

806
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,760
No it didn't.

807
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,760
Bam.

808
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:06,480
It costs like 60 bucks in like fees because it was calling a long distance number or something

809
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,480
like that.

810
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,480
Oh no.

811
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,200
We had a local number in Roseville or something.

812
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,480
So we were able to, I was able to be on Prodigy for like four hours a day.

813
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:18,120
But the problem was when they started opening the plus stuff that costs by the minute, that's

814
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,720
when it got dangerous.

815
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,960
So yeah.

816
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,920
Look forward to that in 2018.

817
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,920
That's right.

818
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,200
Cost by the minute.

819
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,040
You think porn is free now.

820
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:35,060
That's a really good way to explain like net neutrality importance to somebody over 40.

821
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:40,200
Remember when Prodigy and AOL charged for plus services?

822
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:44,440
I remember when AIM came out as a standalone program because like all of my friends had

823
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:49,860
AOL and my dad didn't like AOL as an internet service provider for reasons.

824
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:54,180
So like AIM came out as a standalone and I was like, oh, now I can chat with people,

825
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,740
you know, that I previously had to email.

826
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,280
That was a neat thing to happen.

827
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:00,620
Did you ever build yourself a quilt out of free AOL discs?

828
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:04,900
Uh, not a quilt because how are you going to stitch together CDs?

829
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:08,420
Cause they came in little cardboard things.

830
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,900
I just mostly remember the CDs.

831
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:14,500
The floppies were around, but they were harder to get for me.

832
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:20,420
One of my friends who was very crafty and DIY before DIY was cool tried to make an oven

833
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,420
out of AOL CDs.

834
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:23,500
How do you make an oven?

835
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:29,220
You get like a high powered bulb and line the inside of a box with broken CDs and it's

836
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,860
supposed to reflect.

837
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:31,860
Why did I fucking ask?

838
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:32,860
Like why?

839
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:37,200
Like I knew she would, I should have known she would have an actual answer because I

840
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,200
always have an answer.

841
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,460
In reality, I don't fucking care, but you're terrible.

842
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:47,660
What if, what if we lose all power and the only way that you have to cook any food is

843
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:50,540
with a camp stove made out of AOL discs, Rob?

844
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:54,580
I mean, seriously, it's not going to get very hot cause they're plastic.

845
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:56,220
Guess where all those AOL discs are now?

846
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,860
They're in a fucking landfill somewhere.

847
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:01,380
Well, I'm, I'm the only person in this room, I guess it has survival skills.

848
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,380
Okay.

849
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,380
Whatever.

850
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,540
Here's the, here's the thing with dark Sakura is that she would be the one that would be

851
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:09,700
at the high school reunion go, yeah, I invented post-its and first, first you thermoset your

852
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:14,460
resin and when the temperature gets here, your glucose, it's you.

853
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:19,800
My favorite thing with the AOL CDs though is somebody organized a campaign to mail them

854
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,060
back to AOL in large scale.

855
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:27,460
Like he mobilized everybody who's getting all of these unwanted spam discs and said,

856
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:32,620
we'll just mail them back to AOL cause if everyone pays his own postage, it's not expensive.

857
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:36,740
And I think that's one of the reasons AOL stopped mailing out CDs.

858
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:39,580
Here's Bobby Black Wolf with a funny joke on that whole thing.

859
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:45,420
Bobby Black Wolf says, uh, over at chat live.vognotework.com dark Sakura, are you saying Rob's house is

860
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:49,340
the Atlanta airport because of the blackout that happened there today?

861
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:54,220
Because if you die, it doesn't matter if you go to hell or no, I think that Rob's house

862
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:57,100
is like the Atlanta airport and that it's a shit to navigate.

863
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,940
What do you mean?

864
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,940
Kidding, kidding, kidding.

865
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:01,940
One hallway.

866
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:02,940
You just have to navigate around the laundry pile.

867
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:09,140
At least you don't have, you know, the, uh, the never ending escalator, but you got those

868
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,980
shady characters sleeping on seats.

869
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,340
So, you know, it's true.

870
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:17,700
Look, there's a, there's this homeless guy, Mr. Smoosh, that just stays on that chair.

871
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:21,740
He's got a pair of daddies who love him and an auntie Jamie who spoils the shit out of

872
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:22,740
him.

873
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:27,380
Just so you guys know that a cat tunnel that Jamie brought to the show last week for Mr.

874
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:32,260
Smoosh, he fucking loves that thing, but he can't just be bothered to crawl through the

875
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:34,220
tunnel like a normal cat would know.

876
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,780
He darts through the fucking tunnel.

877
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:39,060
He looks through it and he goes and like darts through it and then looks through it again.

878
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,060
Shake, shake, shake.

879
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,220
And he makes so much noise.

880
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:43,660
By the way, this all happens at three in the morning.

881
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:45,120
That's what cats do.

882
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:49,220
My cat likes to play with their Christmas tree and tries to knock it over and be like

883
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,220
another asshole.

884
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:54,100
Did you notice what we, did you notice what we didn't bother to put up this year?

885
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,100
Yeah.

886
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,780
Did you, if you, cause if you say Christmas tree, cause guess where the Christmas tree

887
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,780
goes?

888
00:35:58,780 --> 00:35:59,780
To hell.

889
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:00,780
In the window.

890
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:04,220
In the window in the exact spot where Mr. Smoosh decided one day, I'm just going to

891
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:09,420
knock everything over to get to this spot where I can look out the window.

892
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:13,420
And so if I put a tree there, a tree's not going to, that tree going to die.

893
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:14,420
Important news alert.

894
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:15,420
Okay.

895
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,420
Yes.

896
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,420
Cher will be in Mamma Mia too.

897
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:19,340
Bitch, where you been?

898
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,540
That was announced like two months ago.

899
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:22,540
Oh, I didn't know.

900
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:27,420
It was Jamie, the conductor of the derail train.

901
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:30,580
It probably took Facebook two months to show it because you know how Facebook is.

902
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,580
That is true.

903
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:33,780
That I will, I will accept that answer.

904
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:34,780
All right.

905
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:38,860
Anyway, at one point we were talking about player unknown battlegrounds, but this being

906
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:41,140
orange launch radio at derail.

907
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:45,380
So let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks and maybe we can get some video game

908
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:48,700
content on our video game program.

909
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:52,220
Dark Sakura, how was your video gaming week?

910
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:58,300
Um, I played animal crossing and some me Tomo.

911
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:01,460
I'm actually getting kind of tired of me Tomo finally.

912
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:07,020
Um, I've played some ingress, but I need more bursters.

913
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,020
This again, right?

914
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:11,140
Well, it's those people who try to take over my work.

915
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:13,180
Um, and I'm playing Pokemon go.

916
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:15,100
I caught a mudkip today.

917
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,100
Good job.

918
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,100
I heard you like mudkips.

919
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,100
Yeah.

920
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,100
Yeah.

921
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:21,260
I was going to post it on Facebook, but it said not to.

922
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:31,300
I did play a little bit of dragon age inquisition, but I put up a, um, a poll on Facebook on

923
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:38,260
which MMO I should go back to final fantasy 14 or, or, uh, wow.

924
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:40,780
I missed this poll somehow.

925
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:41,780
What's yeah.

926
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:42,780
Cause it's on Facebook.

927
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:43,780
What's what's winning.

928
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:44,780
I don't know.

929
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:46,780
Cause I'm waiting for the poll to finish.

930
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,540
Um, I guess I could go look at it.

931
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:49,820
I'll find it and repost it.

932
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:56,140
But um, one of my friends, like just one of her friends randomly, we ran into each

933
00:37:56,140 --> 00:38:00,000
other at the grocery store while my friend was there with us.

934
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,260
And she's, and so the, their free company person's like, I will buy you an apartment

935
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:07,140
if you come join us.

936
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:12,120
I'm like, well then again, void elves.

937
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,360
Why wouldn't somebody buy me an apartment in real life?

938
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,360
That's unfortunate.

939
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,360
Void elves.

940
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,360
All right.

941
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,360
But actually I like my demon spawn better.

942
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,360
My demon hunter.

943
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,360
Sorry.

944
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,360
Uh, anything else for you?

945
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:25,520
Um, super Mario Odyssey is still fun.

946
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,520
Yes it is.

947
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,520
Yep.

948
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,200
How many, how many Mooney things are you up to?

949
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,200
Well, it's not me.

950
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,200
It's Dan playing it.

951
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,000
Oh, but you're, you're, he's mooning everybody.

952
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,200
I've seen you guys play games together before though.

953
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,200
I'm more like his navigator.

954
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,200
Yeah.

955
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,200
Dan playing a video game.

956
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,200
Is you being a backseat driver the entire time?

957
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,200
Pretty much.

958
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:44,200
Well, that's how we got through breath of the wild cause I'm like, no, the wrong way.

959
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,200
No.

960
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,640
Your other left.

961
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,640
It's like he's in band.

962
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:50,040
You're like the world's worst GPS.

963
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,040
Girl.

964
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,040
All right.

965
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,040
I can get anywhere I want to.

966
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,040
All right.

967
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,320
JD wants to comment and then I'm going to get to Loki's.

968
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:58,640
Have you tried playing Odyssey in two player mode or one of you does the hat and the other

969
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,640
does Mario?

970
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,640
That sounds awful.

971
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,720
That sounds like an awful idea.

972
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:04,440
Because I don't cooperate well with others.

973
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,600
I basically suggested that to my husband when he was watching me play and he's like, you're

974
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,040
going to be better at this and you're just going to get frustrated and yell at me.

975
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,400
And I'm like, you're probably right.

976
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,400
Accurate.

977
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,400
That's how it sounds like.

978
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,400
That's married life.

979
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,400
Really.

980
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,400
It is.

981
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:20,400
You have to do something better and getting frustrated at the other person no matter what.

982
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,360
Everyone's got different things.

983
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,400
That's the great thing about the relationship Alan and I have when it comes to games, too,

984
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:28,680
because he can play Overwatch and I can go, you know, you're better at Overwatch than

985
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,680
I am.

986
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,680
Yep.

987
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:33,640
And then he can watch me play something like you can watch me play Mario Odyssey or something

988
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,640
else.

989
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,640
You know, you're probably better at this than I am.

990
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:41,080
And so it's like we each know which lane to stay in, which is great.

991
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,080
Anyway.

992
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,080
Loki, how was your gaming week?

993
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,280
I actually did play something different this week.

994
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:51,680
Aside from just the Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2 stuff, which is really just grinding for

995
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,720
the rest of the characters.

996
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:59,080
I don't know why, because there's not any unique abilities that any of them have.

997
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:04,640
So I started up, because I've been putting it off for weeks now, I started up South Park,

998
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,920
the Fractured But Whole.

999
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,040
And that game is awesome.

1000
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,040
It's pretty funny.

1001
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:15,200
It hasn't quite gotten into the story of the game, because you know with the Stick of Truth

1002
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:20,760
it kind of got into what the actual story of the game is pretty quickly.

1003
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,600
But this hasn't quite gotten there yet.

1004
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:31,160
I'm only on the second day, but it's kind of getting there slowly to figure out what

1005
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,920
the twist story is going to be in there.

1006
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,480
But it's very entertaining.

1007
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:38,480
The new combat system, I actually kind of like it a little bit.

1008
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,200
It does mix it up quite a bit from the previous game.

1009
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:47,960
The only thing I disliked though is the fact that there's one point where you dual specialized.

1010
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:52,160
And so I picked another specialty that I thought I would like, and now I hate it.

1011
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,720
And I was like, crap, I wish I had picked something else.

1012
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:59,180
But I guess the only way you can fix that is by playing the game again from the beginning.

1013
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:03,800
And I don't want to do that, but I wish I could have previewed what the abilities were

1014
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,800
a little bit better.

1015
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,960
But yeah, I've been really enjoying that, so I'll probably continue playing that.

1016
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,160
Didn't get around the VR games.

1017
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,160
Thought about it though.

1018
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,120
That's it.

1019
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,120
All right.

1020
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,120
JD, you want to jump in here?

1021
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,120
How was your gaming week?

1022
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,120
Sure.

1023
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:20,200
Well, I've been playing Animal Crossing on my phone, and I'm kind of getting a little

1024
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,200
tired of it.

1025
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:27,600
Because once you hit around level 30, level 35, they stop inviting new animals over.

1026
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,120
So it's just the same ones back and forth.

1027
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:34,540
Although they just put out an update today where they've started doing flowers.

1028
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:37,120
So I'm immediately interested again.

1029
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:40,600
I've been doing Pokemon Go, like we talked about earlier.

1030
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:47,180
I've been playing the new Zelda Breath of the Wild DLC content, and I'm about halfway

1031
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,560
through it.

1032
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,560
And that's been good.

1033
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:54,400
And I did Splatfest this weekend, which was Friday night to Saturday.

1034
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,400
And that was the sweaters and socks thing, right?

1035
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,400
Yes.

1036
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,640
Like what do you enjoy getting more at Christmas?

1037
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:03,920
I mean, so they framed it as like, we know that these are terrible gifts, but which one

1038
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,060
do you like more?

1039
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:09,440
And I went with socks because honestly, I would rather pick my own sweater.

1040
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,440
Socks are just a commodity.

1041
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,720
I'll take more of them.

1042
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:14,160
You know, they wear out and they're easily replaced.

1043
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,720
Sweaters, I'm like, I want to have my own style.

1044
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:20,160
So I would rather get socks as a gift, but my team lost.

1045
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,240
And they lost big.

1046
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,600
They lost all three of the things.

1047
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:29,880
It was only by like five to 10% on each dimension, but it's like you lose three to zero.

1048
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,440
I would have picked socks too, for what it's worth.

1049
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,440
Right.

1050
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,440
And then Pearl is mean to Marina because Pearl is terrible.

1051
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,440
Bitch.

1052
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:45,360
I've also been playing Oracle of Ages on my 3DS because that was on sale the past couple

1053
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:49,040
of weeks and I'm getting around to clearing my backlog on that.

1054
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,040
All right.

1055
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,160
Sounds like you've had a productive gaming week.

1056
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,160
Yeah.

1057
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,000
My gaming week then, let's see.

1058
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:00,160
So besides mobile games, we already talked about like Pogo and stuff, I've been playing

1059
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,120
more World of Warcraft addict, right?

1060
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,200
But I'm up to level 105.

1061
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:08,280
So on this character, I just started whenever I mentioned I started playing World of Warcraft

1062
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,280
again.

1063
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,240
So that's been kind of fun to play through the content again.

1064
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:14,040
And I'm at the point where I can do the mobile phone stuff for my mission.

1065
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,040
So that's kind of cool.

1066
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:18,800
But then as far as other games too, I've been playing a little bit on Switch.

1067
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,280
I played a really cheap game.

1068
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:23,800
I mean, it was actually like four or five bucks called Kid Trip, which is kind of like

1069
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:29,360
Super Mario Run, but you can, you know, you have a jump button, but then you also have

1070
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:32,600
a button to throw a rock and then the mechanics are a little different.

1071
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:36,800
But I mean, Kid Trip is kind of cool, but it just, it gets way too hard, way too fast.

1072
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:41,400
Like the fifth, I'm on like the fifth level and there's like moving platforms and shit

1073
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:44,500
and I can't get past it and it's kind of frustrating.

1074
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:45,920
So I don't know.

1075
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,520
That's my, that's my only thing is that I wish there was a way to maybe tone it down

1076
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:53,240
a little bit and so I could maybe enjoy the game a little more, but some of the early

1077
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,360
levels were fun.

1078
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:58,120
And I like how like the little creatures when they kill you, like their faces, they'll get

1079
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,640
all like, ha ha ha, I killed you bitch.

1080
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:04,080
So it's just kind of, I like the little, little flourishes they put in this.

1081
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:08,440
Oh, and the game looks very 8-bit because of course it's the hip new thing to do now

1082
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,640
is make your games look retro, but it works.

1083
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,900
It works for this game.

1084
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:16,900
Also on the Switch though, I will mention, it's been a big pinball week.

1085
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:20,200
Dark Soccer, you need to get in on this on Switch because I know you're a pinball fan.

1086
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:23,360
So there's two pinball games that released this past week.

1087
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,600
So the Stern Pinball Collection came out.

1088
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,600
Yeah.

1089
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:27,600
Okay.

1090
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:32,520
So they give you, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is the table that they give you as like a

1091
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:33,760
free download.

1092
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:37,720
But then if you want to buy more tables, so Stern Pinball Arcade, that's the one that's

1093
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:40,800
real tables being put in a game.

1094
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:45,500
And it also has the new Star Trek table, ACDC.

1095
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:48,160
And I can't remember everything else that's in there, but there's other tables too that

1096
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,160
are like newer tables.

1097
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:52,520
Which we could just go to our friends house and play.

1098
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,120
So you would just rather play the real tables?

1099
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,120
Kinda.

1100
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:56,520
I mean, the video pinball's okay.

1101
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:57,520
Yeah.

1102
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:03,560
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, in before Jamie says, I prefer real pinball.

1103
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:04,560
Called it.

1104
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,560
Too late.

1105
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:06,560
Too late.

1106
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,520
But I mean, I'm sure Dan would be interested in something like that.

1107
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,440
I just, I like playing the real thing.

1108
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:13,120
I like feeling the table shake.

1109
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,640
Yeah, I understand.

1110
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:18,920
Well, maybe this other game would be more acceptable for you because also what came

1111
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:23,000
out in addition to Stern Pinball Arcade is Pinball FX3, which I've been playing a little

1112
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
more of.

1113
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,480
Now, the thing about Pinball FX3 is that these are, I don't want to say they're fake tables,

1114
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:28,760
but they're not real tables.

1115
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:32,840
They were made for video pinball and because of that, they do things that you can't do

1116
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:37,520
in real pinball, like Hydra heads that come out of the machine and, you know, do their

1117
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:38,520
thing.

1118
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:41,360
It was like playing pinball on the NES where like weird shit started happening.

1119
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,360
But I like that.

1120
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:45,280
I'm just thinking of Hydra heads and balls and then my brain went blank.

1121
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,280
Okay.

1122
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:52,060
Well anyway, by the way, hot tip, if you download Pinball FX3 before, I think it's Tuesday.

1123
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:54,600
So you either want to do it like tonight while you're listening to OLR live or if you're

1124
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:59,100
listening to the podcast on Monday, you want to get it like now because you get three tables

1125
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:00,740
free if you do that.

1126
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:04,400
Whereas if you wait, you're only going to get the Sorcerer's Lair table for free.

1127
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,400
On Switch?

1128
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,400
They're giving away a pack right now.

1129
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,400
Yeah.

1130
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:08,400
On Switch.

1131
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,400
Let's hold Dan.

1132
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,400
So, but here's the other cool thing, and I'm going to give them props for this because

1133
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,400
this is really cool.

1134
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:14,840
And I know we talked about this on OLR, but it's one thing to kind of do that, but it's

1135
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,120
another to see it in motion.

1136
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:18,300
They have a vertical mode in it.

1137
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:22,400
So when you have your Switch portable, you actually can have the tables in a vertical

1138
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,400
mode.

1139
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:28,480
And that's great because obviously widescreen is not really the right dimensions for a pinball

1140
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:29,480
table, right?

1141
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:32,960
It's like when you play shooter games, it's like all the space is taken up.

1142
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:36,640
And I mean like a space shooter, Ikaruga type of games, right?

1143
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,100
Like you can't really play those in a widescreen.

1144
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:40,140
It's all taken up, right?

1145
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:44,800
But the cool thing is with the Switch, you can flip it into vertical mode.

1146
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,520
And I love that they did that.

1147
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:51,500
And I hope this is something that more games will do like the shooter type games to be

1148
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:53,860
able to use all the real estate and everything.

1149
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:56,880
So that's cool.

1150
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:01,040
The controls are a little funky when you're in vertical mode, but you can remap everything.

1151
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,340
So if you don't like the way it is, you can remap it.

1152
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:06,500
I think technically you can have it vertical and still use.

1153
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:12,220
Like you can like mount your or I guess lay your Switch against books or whatever and

1154
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:13,860
use a pro controller.

1155
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:15,300
And that might be a way to do it as well.

1156
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:17,660
But anyway, I really like that they have the vertical mode.

1157
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:19,300
I wish the Stern game had that too.

1158
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:22,660
If it's there, I didn't see it, but I don't think the Stern game has it, but maybe it's

1159
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:27,060
something they'll be inspired to do because of what they see Pinball FX doing.

1160
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:31,740
The only other thing I could kind of give, that's too bad for on Pinball FX.

1161
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:36,360
Well two things, one, none of the Star Wars or Marvel tables came over.

1162
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:39,600
So you're not able to play those license tables.

1163
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:42,100
You can play like the universal ones.

1164
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:46,540
So like Back to the Future came over, Portal came over.

1165
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:49,920
Some of their license stuff came over, but not probably their biggest ones, the Marvel

1166
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,820
and the Star Wars tables.

1167
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:57,740
The other, excuse me, the other kind of complaint is that you can link your Switch account to

1168
00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:01,020
a Xen account, Xen Pinball, right?

1169
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:05,580
But it doesn't do you any good because you can't bring over your tables from the PC.

1170
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:10,100
So like I have a ton of tables on the PC version because I bought a few and there was a Humble

1171
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:12,880
Bundle not that long ago that had a ton of them in it.

1172
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,100
So I have a ton of tables thanks to that.

1173
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:17,380
And that does me no good right now with the Switch version.

1174
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:20,260
So if I want to play the tables, I'm going to have to re-buy it.

1175
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:25,260
You know, I wonder if you have them on Humble if you go back on there, if they will have

1176
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:27,980
Switch codes for them because Humble does that sometimes.

1177
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:28,980
I doubt it.

1178
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:29,980
It's too old at this point.

1179
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:31,540
And this is too new as well.

1180
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:34,220
That might be, but it's worth a shot anyway.

1181
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:35,220
Yeah.

1182
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:40,240
So, you know, but I also understand that, you know, many games, you know, you're not

1183
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:43,140
going to be able to just carry your content from one platform to the other.

1184
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:47,380
So I can't really like give the developers crap for that, but it's just, oh, that's

1185
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:53,100
kind of a bummer that, you know, Pinball FX is a series that's been running on other platforms

1186
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:54,100
so much longer.

1187
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:55,820
I've been building up my collection there.

1188
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:59,240
And it's kind of a bummer that I can't just import at least some of that.

1189
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:04,860
I mean, if I can't bring over the licenses, then whatever, I kind of get that because

1190
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:06,060
they have to pay a fee for that.

1191
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:10,460
But at least the original tables created by the Pinball FX team, I would hope maybe some

1192
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:14,300
more of those could come over, especially the older ones like Tesla and some of that.

1193
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:20,580
Like I just, it would be nice, but I guess, I guess I can't really, I can't really fault

1194
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:21,840
them too hard for that.

1195
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:27,000
So and Bobby Black Wolf points out Rock Band DLC didn't go between Xbox and PlayStation.

1196
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
They need their cut.

1197
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Yeah.

1198
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,940
I mean, so it's like, I get it, but it is, well, but that also, okay, so you bring up

1199
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:34,740
the Rock Band thing.

1200
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:41,980
That also like made me buy Rock Band 4 on Xbox One, even though I probably have more

1201
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:46,300
gaming stuff on PlayStation 4, but I wanted to carry my library over, right?

1202
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:49,780
So I actually bought it on Xbox One so I could do that.

1203
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:53,040
So you know, sometimes being able to carry your library over is cool.

1204
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:56,220
And the thing about the Switch is that because of the vertical mode and the fact that it's

1205
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:58,900
portable, it's probably the best version.

1206
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:02,060
So that's why it's kind of a bummer that, oh, but I spent all that time building up

1207
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:03,180
the PC collection.

1208
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:07,140
So that's just, that's kind of where it's a little bit frustrating, but I'm not going

1209
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:14,020
to be like angry tweets and all this stuff about it because yeah, logically I get it.

1210
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:17,660
You know, they, they are in the business to make money and they don't make money by giving

1211
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:19,460
everything away for free.

1212
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:22,540
So there you go.

1213
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:28,020
Over in chat, over at live.vognetwork.com, SSG100Matt says you can't buy those Star Wars

1214
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:31,300
tables yet because Disney hasn't bought the company involved yet.

1215
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:33,140
There you go.

1216
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:37,420
Oh, Bobby does point out over at live.vognetwork.com that the two tables they're giving away for

1217
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:40,940
free, it's on all platforms, not just Switch.

1218
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:45,500
So I can go add those to my PC library and do that if I want to.

1219
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,180
That might be fun.

1220
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:52,980
Dark Tetsuya in chat says, I know a lot of the arcade Switch ports support the vertical

1221
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:53,980
mode.

1222
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:57,460
I think the NAGCO museum games that are oriented that way do.

1223
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:58,900
Oh, that's really cool.

1224
00:50:58,900 --> 00:50:59,900
I didn't realize that.

1225
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:00,900
I hope that's a trend.

1226
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:01,900
They keep kind of going with that.

1227
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:02,900
So that's neat.

1228
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:04,460
Anyway, there it is.

1229
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:05,700
That was my gaming week.

1230
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:09,640
So yeah, pinball and World of Warcraft and some mobile phone games.

1231
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:15,340
So anyway, housekeeping, we will not be here live over the next two weeks because next

1232
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:19,620
Sunday is Christmas Eve and I have family plans as does Loki.

1233
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:21,600
I think Jamie does too.

1234
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,420
And then New Year's Eve.

1235
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:27,000
I know y'all would love an OLR New Year's Eve countdown, but the reality is we have

1236
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,960
other things we want to do.

1237
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,640
So our next live show is going to be January 8th.

1238
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:32,640
Oh, excuse me.

1239
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,520
No, I'm looking at the, I'm looking at the wrong year.

1240
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:35,520
Sorry.

1241
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,360
January 7th will be the next live show.

1242
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:39,120
So we'll see you then for that.

1243
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:42,820
However, so that our podcast feed doesn't go too long without a little love.

1244
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:47,060
We are going to do a show around New Year's Eve because we need to do the time capsule

1245
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:49,400
stuff and we'll probably have some other surprises too.

1246
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,340
So we will do a taped show.

1247
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:54,960
We might broadcast that live on VOG, but if you want to find out when that's going to

1248
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:59,760
be, you got to follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR because we haven't picked the exact

1249
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:00,920
time yet.

1250
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:07,000
But if I were going to bet money, I would say it's around noon on New Year's Eve, but

1251
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:13,320
don't hold us to that until we announce it on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.

1252
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:18,920
Also I know anime jam session is putting together some Christmasy stuff for the 25th.

1253
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:22,280
I don't have the exact timeframe on when that's going to run yet, but stay tuned to our Twitter

1254
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:25,120
at VOG network and you can find that out.

1255
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:32,280
I know Rama is going to be doing some ho ho hoeing on the stream, uh, on the 25th.

1256
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:33,280
So let's see.

1257
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,280
Uh, that's it.

1258
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:36,880
I have for housekeeping, so I guess we're going to get into some other gaming news and

1259
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:39,040
looking ahead to 2018 here at the start.

1260
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:40,040
Right?

1261
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:41,040
Loki?

1262
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,040
Yes, that's correct.

1263
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:47,120
So already the registration for E3 2018 has gone public and so you can actually go register

1264
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:48,160
because guess what?

1265
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:54,440
It looks like they're allowing non-industry fans and gamers to buy tickets as well.

1266
00:52:54,440 --> 00:53:00,320
So they're going to be, um, sold in early bird and they also have regular tickets and

1267
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:05,480
according to their FAQ it says E3 is now open to consumers and game enthusiasts on a limited

1268
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:07,820
pass basis.

1269
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:09,960
So that's disappointing.

1270
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:14,640
Which means you're probably going to get more out of E3 by staying home because you won't

1271
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:15,920
have to wait in line at home.

1272
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:16,920
Yeah.

1273
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:22,400
I mean recently with all this stuff, it's, it would be cool to play some of these games,

1274
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,520
but this is not going to happen.

1275
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:30,000
I mean, and honestly just to wait in lines to play demos for stuff, it's kind of neat

1276
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,240
to be able to brag to people.

1277
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:33,800
Yeah, I played that, but no one cares.

1278
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:34,800
No one does.

1279
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:39,460
And you probably learn more from just watching the press through, you know, the press conferences

1280
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:43,320
and hearing the live streams and stuff that they do because you're going to be able to

1281
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:48,960
see all that stuff in more detail than you can just, even if you go there as press and

1282
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:54,000
then you're not like Nijin or something like that, you're going to get shunned off anyways

1283
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,600
and you're going to have to wait, you know, make appointments to see all these people

1284
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,780
to ask them the questions that they're not going to answer because they have.

1285
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:03,900
That's what fucking killed E3 for me right there is the whole like making appointments

1286
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:07,000
to see something that's going to be on YouTube anyway.

1287
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Why bother?

1288
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,440
Yeah, there's no point.

1289
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:16,280
So I just, I would probably want to take some time off to watch this stuff, um, because

1290
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:22,100
it's fun and it's very distracting otherwise, but I mean, I kind of enjoy now watching the,

1291
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:25,000
the press briefings and stuff and then there's, and it seems like each year there's more and

1292
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,200
more companies not participating in E3.

1293
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:30,760
So yeah, you know, who wants to deal with that kind of crap?

1294
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:35,760
I'll be curious what they kind of do to develop the show for the public facing crowd, if anything,

1295
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:40,040
like are they going to try to do more like, I don't know, the, the Nintendo world championships

1296
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:41,040
type of thing.

1297
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,040
Are you sports?

1298
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:43,040
Yeah.

1299
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,400
E-sports are they going to, what are they going to try to do to make it so that there's

1300
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:49,320
more for the public to do if that makes sense?

1301
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:50,320
I don't know.

1302
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:51,320
I don't know.

1303
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:52,320
So we'll see.

1304
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:55,320
I mean, there's still some time to develop that cause we're still in 2017 but yeah, it

1305
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:57,000
looks like they're going to go that same route again next year.

1306
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,360
I mean, maybe they could do something that would get me excited about E3.

1307
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:03,360
I'm not sure what that is, but yeah, I don't know what would really make me would say,

1308
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:06,080
Oh my God, I really need to go.

1309
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:09,680
I can't think of anything aside from like a new console launch.

1310
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:12,480
Yeah, maybe that would like be like fucking revolutionary.

1311
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,200
I have no reason to go.

1312
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:15,200
Yeah.

1313
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:18,760
I just, I, you know, I want to spend the money to go to smaller game shows where I can talk

1314
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:19,760
directly to developers.

1315
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:20,760
I'm still disappointed.

1316
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:24,560
Like I kind of like how they did it and I understand you developing demos and stuff

1317
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:27,800
is kind of hard, but you're making demos anyways for E3.

1318
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:32,640
Like I kind of wish that they would do what they did in 2006 where they actually had like

1319
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,640
demos for games like lost planet.

1320
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:35,640
They had a demo though.

1321
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:38,920
Hey, here's our press conference and now you can play the demo.

1322
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:40,640
It's like E3 at home type thing.

1323
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:43,400
Like I wish they would just do that to a limited extent.

1324
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:47,240
Like, okay, Hey, we've got these games that were shown off on the floor and you know,

1325
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:50,600
maybe it's not necessarily like big games.

1326
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:51,800
It could be indie games even.

1327
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:57,280
I mean just something different.

1328
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:01,200
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says last year the exhibitors weren't told that it was open to

1329
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,400
the public until six weeks beforehand.

1330
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:05,460
They were not prepared for the crowd this year.

1331
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:06,460
They will be.

1332
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:09,520
So that could be interesting to see how that dynamic kind of changes things a little bit

1333
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:12,360
with the preparation having this much time to put into it.

1334
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:13,360
It's true.

1335
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:14,360
We'll see.

1336
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:15,360
Yeah.

1337
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:16,980
They will be trying to throw things together like they were last time.

1338
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:19,600
So JD, what about you?

1339
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:23,920
We're all bitter bitches apparently here at OLR, but you've, you've never been to E3.

1340
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:24,920
Do you have any interest?

1341
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:29,880
Well, I mean, I kind of did like 10 years ago because it was all like anyone could talk

1342
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:30,880
about.

1343
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:37,320
I'm kind of like, eh, I don't really like, I'm honestly only interested in the Nintendo

1344
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:39,180
news most of the time anyway.

1345
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:43,240
So like it doesn't seem like it'd be worth it to, you know, pay a big fee to go see everything.

1346
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:46,680
And if I'm only going to go to one area, um, I don't know.

1347
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:50,720
I feel like the trend is each of the major publishers is doing their own thing.

1348
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:52,000
Like Nintendo has their thing.

1349
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,800
Sony has the PlayStation experience.

1350
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:56,200
Like that just seems to be the way things are going.

1351
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:58,640
So why go to E3?

1352
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:02,640
I, and you know what, if I want to go to the LA convention center, I'll just go one month

1353
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:06,560
before and go to drag con because at least at drag con I can get a picture with Tyra

1354
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:07,560
Sanchez.

1355
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:08,560
No waiting.

1356
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:09,920
So, well, you can do that anywhere.

1357
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:13,800
Tyra Sanchez is, um, I mean that's, that's kind of a lot of it.

1358
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:18,280
It's like if, if E3 were held in the city that I live in, I might actually care more,

1359
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:19,840
but I have to go to SoCal for that.

1360
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,320
And that's just, that's effort.

1361
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:23,200
And if I'm going to go, I'm going to go for something else.

1362
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,680
SoCal driving to SoCal is effort.

1363
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:26,680
It is.

1364
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:31,040
I don't, I don't drive, so I'd have to, you know, take Amtrak or whatever, or just hit

1365
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:32,040
your ride.

1366
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:33,040
It convinced me.

1367
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,920
It's a good idea and hit your ride.

1368
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:36,600
That's is that a precedent you want to set?

1369
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:37,600
Maybe not.

1370
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:38,600
Yes, Jamie.

1371
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:39,600
I'm going to drag con.

1372
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:40,600
Yup.

1373
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:41,600
There you go.

1374
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:42,600
No.

1375
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:43,600
All right.

1376
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:44,600
Uh, moving on.

1377
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:47,360
Let's talk, uh, about Soul Calibur six.

1378
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:50,640
This is now, this is a game that might be at E3 that I would be excited to actually

1379
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:53,240
play, but you know, I, or I could just wait until it comes out.

1380
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:56,360
Soul Calibur is such a tech and clone.

1381
00:57:56,360 --> 00:58:01,200
Soul Calibur six, uh, had some more revealed in Famitsu to talk about what's going to be

1382
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:02,600
in Soul Calibur six.

1383
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:04,540
There was a translation that was done.

1384
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:08,480
They say the development is about 70% and they're talking reboot.

1385
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:09,860
Oh boy.

1386
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:12,600
And that will be reflected in the game's story mode.

1387
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:17,040
Uh, there will be some new characters and classic characters, but you also get guest

1388
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:18,040
characters.

1389
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:21,280
Although of course they're not saying who the guest characters are at this point, but

1390
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:22,760
we had some of those early rumors, right?

1391
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:27,080
Weren't they talking about like fire emblem characters on Nintendo and yeah, I just hope

1392
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:30,200
they bring link back if it's on the switch cause he was in Soul Calibur two.

1393
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:31,200
Is it on the switch?

1394
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,200
I can't remember.

1395
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:33,200
I don't know if it is.

1396
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:34,200
I know it's PS4 and Xbox one for sure.

1397
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:35,200
I can't remember.

1398
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:36,200
Well they better put it on the switch cause everything needs to be on the switch.

1399
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:37,200
I don't know though.

1400
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:41,080
It's gotta be dad Kratos.

1401
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:42,320
It might be daddy Kratos.

1402
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:43,320
Who knows?

1403
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:48,560
Uh, anyway, also coming back, a critical edge attacks with single button activation, uh,

1404
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:49,560
soul charge.

1405
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:52,080
You can meet or burn in order to do certain attack properties.

1406
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:55,520
Uh, the character creation mode is set to return.

1407
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:56,520
Yay.

1408
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:58,680
What about armor breaking?

1409
00:58:58,680 --> 00:58:59,960
I want to know for Kelek.

1410
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:03,160
I mean, I don't think they're saying that yet.

1411
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:06,960
So, uh, and dark Tetsuya says, uh, it has not been announced for switch at least for

1412
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,120
the VGA trailer.

1413
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:10,980
And probably it's just one of those things where now the switches power is holding it

1414
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:11,980
back a little bit.

1415
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:12,980
So we'll see.

1416
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:16,720
Uh, anyhow, also something to consider about Soul Calibur six.

1417
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,760
Uh, I mentioned it is kind of a reboot.

1418
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:22,280
It is going to take place during the events of the first game.

1419
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:28,000
So you are revisiting the events of the original Soul Calibur to uncover hidden truths.

1420
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,000
So kind of interesting.

1421
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:33,720
I don't know if they're doing like a mortal combat nine type of thing where they're like

1422
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:37,000
revisiting the same story, but they didn't call it just Soul Calibur.

1423
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,200
They're calling it Soul Calibur six.

1424
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:41,160
All I have to say about that is reboot.

1425
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,480
Wasn't there like also soul edge before Soul Calibur?

1426
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:45,160
Like there's a complicated story.

1427
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:49,240
It is a complicated story and, and, uh, and some of the characters then kind of share

1428
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:51,720
with other, like they come, they come from Tekken and shit.

1429
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:53,600
So dude, it's a fighting game.

1430
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:55,680
There doesn't need to be a storyline, you know, she meets you.

1431
00:59:55,680 --> 01:00:01,600
But then later guest characters, like soul edge was the one that came out on PlayStation

1432
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:04,080
and then soul blazer had nothing to do with any of those games.

1433
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:05,080
That was super Nintendo game.

1434
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:06,080
It was awesome.

1435
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:11,120
Soul Calibur was the now me hardware series.

1436
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:12,640
So anyway, uh, yes.

1437
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:17,440
And this other article I'm looking at is confirming PlayStation four, Xbox one and PC next year.

1438
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:18,440
Not the switch.

1439
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:19,440
Sorry, JD.

1440
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:20,440
But you never know.

1441
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:22,360
I'll always hold out hope.

1442
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:23,640
You never know what will happen.

1443
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:25,360
The soul still burns.

1444
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:26,920
All right.

1445
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:28,680
Uh, dark soccer.

1446
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:29,680
What do you have for us?

1447
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:31,640
Oh, some stuff.

1448
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:34,120
Basically modders gonna mod, right?

1449
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:39,640
So of course there, um, have already modded, you know, breath of the wild further, you

1450
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:40,640
know, things.

1451
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:45,320
Like in all kinds of weird outfits with, you know, key blades and shit dong mod.

1452
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:56,680
Well, they've, there's a mod now that changes his bike to a Sonic running well, cause you

1453
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:57,920
got to go fast.

1454
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:02,600
Link writing Sonic is the fanfic I never knew I needed.

1455
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:08,800
And then there's one that I guess turns them into Sanchez from GTA.

1456
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:12,520
It's a CJ right in a Sanchez with, uh, forget the guy.

1457
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:13,520
Okay.

1458
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:16,000
Cause I didn't catch the train CJ.

1459
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:20,880
Oh, and then there's the road runner.

1460
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:21,880
That's pretty cool.

1461
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:22,880
Do you get to that now?

1462
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:23,880
That's what they should do.

1463
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:27,120
They should make a video game that's like Zelda breath of the wild, but it's the road

1464
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:32,480
runner killing a Wiley coyote in all sorts of strange and mysterious ways on the one

1465
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:37,440
does this too, but it's like the there's like feet wheels.

1466
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:41,600
And so it looks really cartoony and it works well, it's in motion, but it's just like,

1467
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:45,040
he's got like wheels made out of feet.

1468
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:46,040
It's just crazy.

1469
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:47,560
Isn't that kind of what Sonic has?

1470
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:49,320
Well, I'm looking at the road runner one.

1471
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:51,040
Oh, well they have the road runner one.

1472
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,040
Road runner.

1473
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:53,360
Maybe look at that.

1474
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:57,760
You know, there was a road runner video game back in the days of the Atari game.

1475
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:58,760
A couple.

1476
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:02,760
There was actually also one on super Nintendo that ironically enough was very much like

1477
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:03,840
Sonic the hedgehog.

1478
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:07,040
The Sonic one looks better cause he's got like his hands behind him.

1479
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:11,360
Like he's doing his real fast run that the road runner one was just fucking weird.

1480
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:15,880
Cause when I got my super Nintendo, I was like, do I want Mario brothers?

1481
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:16,880
No.

1482
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:17,880
Fuck that.

1483
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:18,880
I want road runners.

1484
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:19,880
Death Valley rally.

1485
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:20,880
Fuck.

1486
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:21,880
Yeah.

1487
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:22,880
No.

1488
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:23,880
Apparently Mario brothers.

1489
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:24,880
It was like $90.

1490
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:25,880
It was like, it was expensive.

1491
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:28,320
Um, cause I bought it used, I bought all that stuff used.

1492
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:29,320
I don't know why.

1493
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:33,040
For some reason I, I would have probably gotten super Mario world.

1494
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:35,000
Maybe it was because I was smart and new.

1495
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,400
Hey, I have lots of friends.

1496
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:38,640
They have super Nintendo's and they have that.

1497
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:42,200
We'll just borrow each other's games cause that's what we used to do.

1498
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:47,160
And so I got red runners, death Valley rally, and it is very much like a Sonic game.

1499
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:48,160
Okay.

1500
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:51,520
And kind of, isn't that also one of the hardest games to emulate?

1501
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:53,340
I don't know, but it's a pretty hard game.

1502
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:57,080
I think road runner is a, there's something about like the boxes don't show up in one

1503
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:58,080
of the levels.

1504
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:02,640
Like it's a very rare type of super Nintendo thing or maybe I'm confusing it with an NES

1505
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:03,640
game.

1506
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:04,640
I think it is.

1507
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:05,640
Yeah.

1508
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:07,240
And it's not that it's, you know, there's where they say emulators can always pull it

1509
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:08,240
off perfectly.

1510
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:11,320
So, all right, well that'd be fun.

1511
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:12,320
Dark soccer.

1512
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:14,760
Any interest in modding your breath of the wild for anything?

1513
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:15,760
No.

1514
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:19,760
I mean you basically, it's all just with um, uh, an emulator anyway.

1515
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:20,760
Hmm.

1516
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:22,080
I guess that's true.

1517
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:26,200
So, which the thing I like about watching other people do that is they'll like watching

1518
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:32,000
like the, the map zooms and how far out the maps go to see how the game's constructed.

1519
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,320
All right, let's move on Loki.

1520
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:40,360
So this isn't really a ton of news, but Obsidian is basically saying that their next game that

1521
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:44,820
they're working on will not have microtransactions of any kind.

1522
01:03:44,820 --> 01:03:47,800
Now, they're basically saying that...

1523
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:49,200
That's kind of great news, actually.

1524
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:57,000
Well, no, no, I understand that, but it does set an interesting precedent that these, obviously,

1525
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:02,520
publishers out there are aware of the situation and the gamers' views on microtransactions

1526
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:07,520
to where they feel it's necessary to come out and make a statement like this, saying

1527
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:11,360
that, hey, listen, we're not going to have any of that crap.

1528
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:19,320
So they're basically showing off, I guess, it's some new project they haven't really

1529
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:24,160
said yet, but it's going to be in conjunction with Private Division, which I guess is Take

1530
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:28,800
Two's new publishing label, and it's going to be an RPG of some sort, which I guess makes

1531
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:33,000
sense because it is Obsidian.

1532
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,360
So yeah, I'm glad to see that they're not going to try to shoehorn that in like they

1533
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:40,840
did with Middle-earth Shadow of War.

1534
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:45,160
And you know that when you buy the game, you will have the game.

1535
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:46,160
That's it.

1536
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:48,200
Unless there's a season pass, because there's no...

1537
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:50,680
It doesn't say anything about that.

1538
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:53,000
Mega-transactions are still okay.

1539
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Season passes, eh, eh, eh, that's fine, DLC is fine.

1540
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,000
But you know what?

1541
01:04:58,040 --> 01:05:03,200
It's an RPG, usually RPGs are pretty meaty as it is, I don't feel that it's necessarily

1542
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,200
a bad thing.

1543
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:09,340
But do you think, on average, people spend more on a mega-transaction DLC package, or

1544
01:05:09,340 --> 01:05:14,920
on individual micro-transactions that they continuously buy?

1545
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:17,240
I don't know, see, for me, I only buy the big stuff.

1546
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:19,600
I don't like to buy the little stuff.

1547
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:21,600
Every gamer's different.

1548
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:26,200
I wonder what it's like in the statistical sense, like, how much does killing micro-transactions

1549
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:28,040
actually cost them money?

1550
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:32,240
Well, I know it's like, I don't really play a lot of games that have micro-transactions.

1551
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:37,200
The only thing that I can think of that sorta did, and I thought it was absolutely ridiculous,

1552
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:42,880
was actually Saints Row the 3rd or the 4th, actually probably both of them, where they

1553
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:47,840
had a fuck-ton of, like, cosmetic DLC that really didn't fucking do anything.

1554
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:49,880
It was just all cosmetics.

1555
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:53,840
And that was pretty cheap, but it was still like a micro-transaction, whereas they had

1556
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:59,040
DLC content for it that added new weapons and new modes and stuff like that, and extended

1557
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:00,480
the story a little bit.

1558
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:04,560
That I purchased, the other cosmetic stuff, I was like, fuck that shit, I'm not playing

1559
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:05,560
that.

1560
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:09,200
Well, it kinda also goes back to, let's say, the granddaddy of this whole fucking thing.

1561
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:14,760
Going back to Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion, and horse armor, versus, you know...

1562
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:15,760
Knights of the Nine.

1563
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:16,760
Yeah, exactly.

1564
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:21,640
The vampire mod, or the expansion, that was actually Skyrim, but you know what I mean!

1565
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:25,440
All those, like, full quest lines and stuff that were fleshed out there.

1566
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:26,440
Yes.

1567
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:30,800
And I mean, at least to their credit for Oblivion, they had a ton of expansions, and even some

1568
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:32,240
I think were free.

1569
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:38,640
So I know at least some came free on demo-dis that were with the Xbox Magazine or whatever,

1570
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:39,640
so hell yes.

1571
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:40,640
Hell yes.

1572
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:46,160
Alright, moving on, let's talk a little bit about Destiny 2, speaking about money.

1573
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:49,960
Because Curse of Osiris actually launched, I totally forgot that that was, god, I feel

1574
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:53,920
like the PC version just came out, and now here we are already on an expansion, but the

1575
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:56,960
PC one was delayed a little bit, so there you go.

1576
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:02,480
Anyway, originally, vanilla players in Curse of Osiris were kinda walled off from key content,

1577
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:07,200
meaning like, weekly endgame stuff, and things that you need for trophies and achievements.

1578
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:10,640
So as you can imagine, the community was like, fuck you greedy bastards!

1579
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:12,800
I'm paraphrasing, but that's basically what it was.

1580
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:18,920
Apparently though, they are listening, and with the next Destiny 2 update, 1.1.1, many

1581
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:22,640
of these changes are going to be reversed, access to endgame content will be available

1582
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:26,400
for those who haven't purchased Curse of Osiris.

1583
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:30,560
That update is scheduled to have already gone out, so it went out this past week already,

1584
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:34,280
so hopefully that is doing well for the players, they did have to take the game down for seven

1585
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:37,840
hours to fix that, so, good.

1586
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:42,480
So now if I decide to play more Destiny 2, I'm not forced to buy this Curse of Osiris

1587
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:46,200
to figure out what the endgame is all about, because I did play Destiny 2 up to like level

1588
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:48,280
10, and then I was like, ooh shiny!

1589
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:49,500
And I played other games.

1590
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:55,040
But that's very typical for me in video games, is that, you know, unless it's an MMO or a

1591
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:59,640
multiplayer or something, I get which, funny enough, Destiny is kinda both those things,

1592
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:02,480
but I still get sidetracked with other stuff.

1593
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:04,920
I tend to go where the people I know are playing.

1594
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:08,260
And I didn't know a lot of people playing Destiny 2 on PC, sadly.

1595
01:08:08,260 --> 01:08:09,260
Just like, one.

1596
01:08:09,260 --> 01:08:10,260
No, two.

1597
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:15,000
I played with our mutual friend, Crystal.

1598
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:19,820
I played on that, and then my buddy Delvin from Video Game Realness was the only other

1599
01:08:19,820 --> 01:08:23,920
person I think I played Destiny 2 online with, so, that's it.

1600
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:26,820
Alright, more stories, Dark Sakura.

1601
01:08:26,820 --> 01:08:30,040
This made me happy, and I wish I could play some of the music from the trailer, because

1602
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:32,940
it just made me super happy.

1603
01:08:32,940 --> 01:08:40,820
But there's a new trailer for Dragon Ball FighterZ, and it's set to We Were Angels,

1604
01:08:40,820 --> 01:08:47,500
which was the ending theme for Dragon Ball Z in its original run from 1993 to 1996.

1605
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:54,340
God, I can't believe that people didn't get that part of the series until 2001 here.

1606
01:08:54,340 --> 01:08:57,860
That's crazy, just how far behind we were on it.

1607
01:08:57,860 --> 01:09:05,240
But at any rate, it also shows some other fighters that are gonna be in there.

1608
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:13,200
So it brings Hit, Beerus, and Goku Black to the series, so that's gonna be pretty cool.

1609
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:17,740
It looks like it just really kind of does that Xenoverse thing where it replays past

1610
01:09:17,740 --> 01:09:19,400
fights and everything.

1611
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:23,060
And I think it's gonna be really fun, I'm looking forward to it.

1612
01:09:23,060 --> 01:09:28,360
But I hope, though, if we get some of the super characters, that we then get Cabba and

1613
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:31,840
Caulifla and all them, because they're fun, too.

1614
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:35,080
Alright, you're definitely checking this game out when it comes out, right?

1615
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:36,080
No shit.

1616
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:37,080
Yeah, I know.

1617
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:38,480
It's on your must-have list.

1618
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:41,080
Yeah, it's on my Jamie want list.

1619
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:45,480
Alright, just a few more stories for you guys, and then Jamie will want to pick a classic

1620
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:46,480
game for you all.

1621
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:47,480
The last one of the year.

1622
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:48,480
The last one of the year.

1623
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:49,480
Maybe.

1624
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:50,480
No, it is.

1625
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:52,940
Well, no, because there might be a New Year's Eve one.

1626
01:09:52,940 --> 01:09:53,940
So maybe.

1627
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:54,940
Maybe.

1628
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:57,520
It might be your last pick, but we're waiting to see how that works out.

1629
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:58,520
I picked a good one.

1630
01:09:58,520 --> 01:09:59,520
What?

1631
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:00,520
I picked a good one, though.

1632
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:01,520
You did pick a good one.

1633
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:02,520
Alright.

1634
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:03,520
Until we get to that moment, though, we have a couple more stories.

1635
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:04,520
Loki.

1636
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:08,040
This has been a game that has been removed from Steam.

1637
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:11,920
How horrible must it be that it got removed from Steam, because there's a whole lot of

1638
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:16,400
horrible shit on Steam right now, and it's quite amazing that all of that's still there.

1639
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:19,680
Well, apparently there's a game actually called Shit on Steam.

1640
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:20,680
No, it was not.

1641
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:28,440
It was called You Must Be 18 or Older to Enter, and it's basically, they call it basically

1642
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:32,120
a simulator.

1643
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:37,080
It's simulating being underage and looking at porn websites in the early parts of the

1644
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:38,080
Internet.

1645
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:39,080
Wow.

1646
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:41,240
And so, well, it's all ASCII.

1647
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:43,120
Like all of the art is ASCII.

1648
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:44,680
Did you say ass-y?

1649
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:45,680
It's all ass-y?

1650
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:49,680
Well, ironically, you should say that because the image that they show on the screen isn't

1651
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:51,320
ASCII and it is of an ass.

1652
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:56,840
So I mean, it sort of does make, you know, there is a pun there, but yes, it's basically

1653
01:10:56,840 --> 01:11:03,400
it's you explore a series of lo-fi websites, they say, as a first-time porn liker.

1654
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:04,400
And then...

1655
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:06,960
This is like playing strip poker on the Commodore 64.

1656
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:13,880
To recreate the isolated disorientation, they said that you have to also, like, basically

1657
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:18,840
you have to deal with pop-ups that make loud noises and different, like, other jump scares

1658
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:22,640
and you have to look behind you, that type of stuff, you know, making sure that your

1659
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:24,160
parents aren't walking up on it.

1660
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:30,680
But anyway, so they got, the developer that made this game, got an email from Valve basically

1661
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:32,600
saying your game's been banned from Steam.

1662
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:37,280
Of course, you know, he then wrote back saying, well, there's been other games that have had

1663
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:40,200
way more, you know, explicit stuff.

1664
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:44,040
Like for example, let's talk about Saints Row again, Saints Row the Third had a whole

1665
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:50,200
scene where you fight through naked in a BDSM club and it had a giant fucking dickbat, okay?

1666
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:52,580
There's a giant fucking dildo bat.

1667
01:11:52,580 --> 01:11:54,040
That was true.

1668
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:56,480
That was a microtransaction worth the purchase.

1669
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:57,480
No, it actually wasn't.

1670
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:59,000
And you can get one for real.

1671
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,120
You can get one for real.

1672
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:02,880
Yeah, just check your local good vibrations.

1673
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:05,640
Yeah, look forward to the upcoming DDR tournament.

1674
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:07,720
The Retain 13 Jamie and I are gonna do.

1675
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:11,400
So yeah, basically, you know, Valve banned the game.

1676
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:16,080
They basically, you know, he claims that, you know, it's been more explicit or anything

1677
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:21,680
and a lot of the stuff out there is more explicit than you must be 18 or older to enter.

1678
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:23,800
But no one else seemed to care.

1679
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:29,240
And on top of that, you know, they even tried to, um, I guess blur some of the images and

1680
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:32,860
stuff even a little bit more, but it still wasn't enough.

1681
01:12:32,860 --> 01:12:36,880
And they just kind of want to know what exactly are the rules in for this?

1682
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:41,620
Because it seems like you're offering different standards depending on the game or publisher.

1683
01:12:41,620 --> 01:12:42,840
What am I allowed to show?

1684
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:43,840
What am I not?

1685
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:44,840
Do I get to show titty?

1686
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:46,640
Do I get to show?

1687
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:51,000
There's like, like indie games though that have, they're on Steam.

1688
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Shower with your dad simulator.

1689
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Shower with your dad.

1690
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:58,360
See, we have a perfect example or like even like, um, fucking, there's other games out

1691
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:02,380
there that have like, you know, bare chested women and stuff, or even there's like Japanese

1692
01:13:02,380 --> 01:13:05,600
games out there and you squirt women down and their clothes come off and stuff like

1693
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:06,600
that.

1694
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:07,600
What was the game you were playing?

1695
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:08,600
I think this is years ago.

1696
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:11,480
You're actually playing it during OLR and it was a game about like you rotated the breasts

1697
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:12,480
in different directions.

1698
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:15,880
Oh, I don't know what that was, but that was like a little flash game that someone made.

1699
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:16,880
That was funny.

1700
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:19,280
It was, it was like, it was like a rhythm game.

1701
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,720
And you slap the breasts and use the rhythm method.

1702
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:25,520
And so they have like different moves that you have to do.

1703
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:29,080
So they had like, you had to bounce the tits up and down, you had to swing them side to

1704
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:31,320
side and you had to spin them around.

1705
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:36,480
And based on, on that, you know, there's, you had to do all those moves to, you know,

1706
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:40,040
take out the different things coming up before they hit the top of the screen.

1707
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:42,120
And so it was like, it was silly.

1708
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:47,080
But um, you know, something like they have stuff out there that is violating these rules

1709
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:48,080
as it is.

1710
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:49,080
And it's kind of unfair.

1711
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:56,040
They pick on this guy that really, dude, I mean, it's, it's very basic ASCII art.

1712
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:59,160
Rage Nator points out genital jousting and mount your friends.

1713
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:00,160
Yes, exactly.

1714
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:01,560
Genital jousting.

1715
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:07,400
It's fucking dicks, big fucking dicks in the game, floppy dicks.

1716
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:12,000
Is it because maybe this is an indie game that hasn't maybe was genital jousting rated

1717
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:17,120
by the ESRB and no one couldn't have because that would have been an AO game.

1718
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:18,120
I do.

1719
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:20,240
I think genital jousting is banned from Twitch for what it's worth.

1720
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:21,240
Yeah, it is.

1721
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:24,160
But seriously though, genital jousting, okay.

1722
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:29,000
ASCII art, which barely looks like anything and not even really, it's just kind of like,

1723
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:34,640
this is supposed to be porn, but it's not really porn and that's not okay.

1724
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:35,640
Obviously different standards.

1725
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:39,080
It's, it's a little surprising to me because I got recommended a lot of dating sim games

1726
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:43,400
that were very straight and I don't know how graphic they were, but like the way they were

1727
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:46,920
advertised, it's like, it looks like you're going to see stuff.

1728
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:47,920
And those are on steam.

1729
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:52,520
Like those are actually like actually marketed at me because I played a gay dating sim, you

1730
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:54,280
know, because they have terrible algorithms.

1731
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:58,760
So, but that's kind of surprising that it's just ASCII art and they're saying that's too

1732
01:14:58,760 --> 01:14:59,760
explicit.

1733
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:01,960
It's not even like really good ASCII art.

1734
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:06,120
It's like, it's sort of, it looks, I mean like this picture, you can tell it's supposed

1735
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:12,240
to be like a guy with like someone bent over him, but like it's black and white and it's

1736
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:13,240
ASCII art.

1737
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:16,880
And then they have like a little like add to the side that it sorta looks like a woman's

1738
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:20,240
profile, but it's fucking ASCII art.

1739
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:21,240
But it might be a dude.

1740
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:22,240
Okay.

1741
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:26,220
But I've got to ask this question shouldn't be important, but it might be, is it primarily

1742
01:15:26,220 --> 01:15:28,840
gay content or is it straight content or is it both?

1743
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:29,840
I don't know.

1744
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:30,840
Sometimes that makes a difference.

1745
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:31,840
It doesn't really say.

1746
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:35,360
It says you have, they have like, I don't really understand what the game is.

1747
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:41,800
So it says you guys, you, you take more mental notes and it says orgy German milf, anal,

1748
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:42,800
and your type.

1749
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:46,860
And then they have orgy German milf or anal and you, I mean, if it's milf, it's straight

1750
01:15:46,860 --> 01:15:53,420
but like there's a history of gay adult content getting censored more judiciously than straight

1751
01:15:53,420 --> 01:15:55,380
like, okay, like I'll show you the screenshot here.

1752
01:15:55,380 --> 01:15:58,940
It's like, it's really stupid.

1753
01:15:58,940 --> 01:16:02,540
Like that's, that's in a high quality ASCII art.

1754
01:16:02,540 --> 01:16:08,980
On the flip side though, this game is now getting more publicity than it would have

1755
01:16:08,980 --> 01:16:09,980
ever got before.

1756
01:16:09,980 --> 01:16:12,980
So I would hope that this game is available on itch.io or something because like seriously

1757
01:16:12,980 --> 01:16:17,140
right now, like I see people in chat going, I should check this out.

1758
01:16:17,140 --> 01:16:21,100
Or this game looks hilarious and it's like, we would have never talked about this game

1759
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:23,220
if Steam hadn't abandoned it.

1760
01:16:23,220 --> 01:16:26,820
So I almost feel like this, these developers should just fucking embrace the too hot for

1761
01:16:26,820 --> 01:16:32,780
Steam thing and you're going to sell tons or tons more than you were going to before.

1762
01:16:32,780 --> 01:16:35,860
You already have your fucking credit cards on file with a lot of these things.

1763
01:16:35,860 --> 01:16:40,540
I mean, just put a credit card on file to assert that you're over 18 and then let the

1764
01:16:40,540 --> 01:16:41,540
porn flow.

1765
01:16:41,980 --> 01:16:44,140
Let the porn flow.

1766
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:49,920
So I'll just point out that the gay dating sim I played, um, did have a censored release

1767
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:54,120
on Steam because they have to, to get around the content filter, but there's also easily

1768
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:59,340
unofficial patches where you can put the standalone adult content back in the game.

1769
01:16:59,340 --> 01:17:02,340
So they, but it sounds like it's difficult to do that with a game built around ASCII

1770
01:17:02,340 --> 01:17:05,060
art cause it's rendering text instead of inserting images.

1771
01:17:05,060 --> 01:17:06,060
Huh?

1772
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:07,060
I don't know.

1773
01:17:07,060 --> 01:17:08,060
Yeah.

1774
01:17:08,580 --> 01:17:12,340
But anyway, let's wait six months for Valve to see the bad publicity and look at all the

1775
01:17:12,340 --> 01:17:16,020
money from people buying it that could have been on Steam and reverse their decision.

1776
01:17:16,020 --> 01:17:18,620
Like, I don't know if they were charging for it though.

1777
01:17:18,620 --> 01:17:21,660
Oh, if it's a free game, then they're probably less.

1778
01:17:21,660 --> 01:17:22,660
There's less you can get away with.

1779
01:17:22,660 --> 01:17:25,300
Should we invite these guys on the show to talk about porn?

1780
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:26,300
Yes.

1781
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:36,300
So yeah, the game it's, it's James Earl Cox, the third, Joe Cox and Julian, Julie, uh,

1782
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:43,300
you can in are the people who made it guys, I swear to God.

1783
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:44,300
Love it.

1784
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:45,300
All right.

1785
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:47,900
Like they even have, like, it's supposed to be an AOL welcome screen and it's like, do

1786
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:48,900
your search.

1787
01:17:48,900 --> 01:17:51,500
You search for porn, people doing it.

1788
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:52,500
Sex or fourth base.

1789
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:53,500
Wait.

1790
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:56,060
So it simulates AOL chat rooms from like the nineties.

1791
01:17:56,060 --> 01:17:57,420
Well, it's all in ASCII art.

1792
01:17:57,420 --> 01:17:58,420
What a throwback.

1793
01:17:58,420 --> 01:18:00,460
I'd have to be like through a terminal or something.

1794
01:18:00,460 --> 01:18:01,460
All right.

1795
01:18:01,460 --> 01:18:05,460
Let's, let's take a trip down memory lane when yes, please.

1796
01:18:05,460 --> 01:18:09,820
Adult games were sold at adult stores and they were like legendary and it's like your

1797
01:18:09,820 --> 01:18:12,220
uncle had a friend who had it, but they really didn't.

1798
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:13,620
You just made that up.

1799
01:18:13,620 --> 01:18:17,700
Oh, so I did find the link to the game, so I will link it in the chat room because it's

1800
01:18:17,700 --> 01:18:18,700
on itch.io.

1801
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:19,700
I knew it.

1802
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:20,700
There you go.

1803
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:21,700
And they're going to,

1804
01:18:21,700 --> 01:18:22,700
Oh, I don't know.

1805
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:23,700
It's tough.

1806
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:24,700
Oh, it's actually really neat.

1807
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:25,700
Little indie store.

1808
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:26,700
Check it out.

1809
01:18:26,700 --> 01:18:27,700
It's cool.

1810
01:18:27,700 --> 01:18:28,700
There's lots of free games on it too.

1811
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:29,700
I try not to spend money, but I will.

1812
01:18:29,700 --> 01:18:30,700
There's a pay what you want a lot of times.

1813
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:31,700
Okay.

1814
01:18:31,700 --> 01:18:40,780
Look, here's back when you had to pay $90, 50 bucks or actually, no, I think tonight's

1815
01:18:40,780 --> 01:18:43,140
game, you had to pay like 200 bucks for it.

1816
01:18:43,140 --> 01:18:46,140
The classic game of the week, dark soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and

1817
01:18:46,140 --> 01:18:52,780
find a game that she thinks, Hey, put down your porn and play this quality fapping.

1818
01:18:52,780 --> 01:18:55,220
Stop fapping, put away the Crisco.

1819
01:18:55,220 --> 01:18:56,220
Start yapping.

1820
01:18:56,220 --> 01:18:57,220
All right.

1821
01:18:57,220 --> 01:18:58,220
Dark soccer.

1822
01:18:58,220 --> 01:18:59,220
What is the game of the week?

1823
01:18:59,740 --> 01:19:07,140
I've already done blazing star, but pull star is one of my favorite, um, side schooling

1824
01:19:07,140 --> 01:19:08,140
shooters.

1825
01:19:08,140 --> 01:19:13,540
It is, it was published by SNK, Neo Geo, Neo Geo CD and arcade.

1826
01:19:13,540 --> 01:19:16,860
And as I said, it was the predecessor of blazing star.

1827
01:19:16,860 --> 01:19:21,460
It was also the first Neo Geo game to incorporate pre-rendered graphics.

1828
01:19:21,460 --> 01:19:23,940
Um, it had, I finally have some music.

1829
01:19:23,940 --> 01:19:26,940
Well, that's why I gave you the minute mark.

1830
01:19:27,660 --> 01:19:34,620
Well, you know what, anyway, um, it was also re-released in 2017 under the arcade archives

1831
01:19:34,620 --> 01:19:39,340
that were developed by hamster corporation for PS4 and Xbox one.

1832
01:19:39,340 --> 01:19:43,060
Um, it is a super fun game.

1833
01:19:43,060 --> 01:19:47,900
Um, basically you have different, you know, types of spacecraft to choose from.

1834
01:19:47,900 --> 01:19:50,020
You get different power ups.

1835
01:19:50,020 --> 01:19:55,940
And um, the thing that I liked about it is that it did resemble a good bit of R-type

1836
01:19:55,940 --> 01:19:59,620
with, you know, the way that your power ups works and everything.

1837
01:19:59,620 --> 01:20:04,780
This looks a lot like Gradius 2, like what I'm looking at is a lot like Gradius 2 with

1838
01:20:04,780 --> 01:20:05,780
the fire.

1839
01:20:05,780 --> 01:20:09,820
It definitely took its homage, you know, like I could play burning heat in the background

1840
01:20:09,820 --> 01:20:12,780
and I would think it's Gradius 2, but anyway, no, it looks cool though.

1841
01:20:12,780 --> 01:20:16,020
It definitely looks like a, like a, an evolved form of it.

1842
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:18,020
Like not to, not to knock the game cause it looks sweet.

1843
01:20:18,020 --> 01:20:22,700
Well, it certainly though is, I would say a, um, a product of its time.

1844
01:20:22,700 --> 01:20:26,180
It came out in 1995 originally.

1845
01:20:26,180 --> 01:20:32,500
So it has that nineties anime character styling, you know, where the, the bangs were just,

1846
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:35,540
you know, unbelievably set aside and tall.

1847
01:20:35,540 --> 01:20:38,900
Um, but it's really is a very fun shooter.

1848
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:41,380
It has, you know, different, uh, voices that go on it.

1849
01:20:41,380 --> 01:20:49,420
The most of the visuals are, uh, 3d pre-rendered, um, with a full cut scenes and a pre-rendered

1850
01:20:49,420 --> 01:20:50,820
movies.

1851
01:20:50,820 --> 01:20:56,020
And you also, uh, once you have your power ups, you get a small orb hanging out on your

1852
01:20:56,020 --> 01:21:01,740
butt and it can be used to, um, absorb or deflect fire.

1853
01:21:01,740 --> 01:21:09,180
Kind of like how, um, the, uh, the one from R-Type is, the little add on thing.

1854
01:21:09,180 --> 01:21:16,860
Um, but Pole Star is, I mean, it really did get some mixed reviews, either people super

1855
01:21:16,860 --> 01:21:19,580
loved it or they super hated it.

1856
01:21:19,580 --> 01:21:25,220
Um, it across the board, it was, um, you know, people liked the graphics, but still a lot

1857
01:21:25,220 --> 01:21:29,140
of people said that it just didn't seem very original, you know, and I don't care what

1858
01:21:29,140 --> 01:21:31,660
any of those people think because they're wrong.

1859
01:21:31,660 --> 01:21:37,740
Um, Pole Star is one of, I would say the best Neo Geo games.

1860
01:21:37,740 --> 01:21:40,260
Blazing Star is better.

1861
01:21:40,260 --> 01:21:44,820
Don't get me wrong, but Pole Star is a really, really good game.

1862
01:21:44,820 --> 01:21:48,180
And it's one that I think a lot of people, you know, if you haven't played it, you're

1863
01:21:48,180 --> 01:21:49,180
missing out.

1864
01:21:49,180 --> 01:21:51,180
So there you go.

1865
01:21:51,180 --> 01:21:55,580
Put that quote on the back of the box, if you haven't played it, you're missing out.

1866
01:21:55,580 --> 01:21:56,580
Classic game of the week.

1867
01:21:56,580 --> 01:21:57,580
Pole Star.

1868
01:21:57,580 --> 01:21:59,580
If you haven't played it, why?

1869
01:21:59,580 --> 01:22:02,220
Well, to be fair, Neo Geos are kind of expensive.

1870
01:22:02,220 --> 01:22:04,300
And it just got a, it got a PS4.

1871
01:22:04,300 --> 01:22:05,300
That is true.

1872
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:10,340
Although I've understood though that for some of the Neo Geo collections out there, um,

1873
01:22:10,340 --> 01:22:13,500
watch out for the emulation cause some of them have some weird artifacting.

1874
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:14,500
Just saying.

1875
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:15,500
Yeah.

1876
01:22:16,100 --> 01:22:22,660
And if somebody wants to find me a Blazing Star cartridge for my Neo Geo at home, I wouldn't

1877
01:22:22,660 --> 01:22:23,660
say no.

1878
01:22:23,660 --> 01:22:25,500
That would be a great Hanukkah present.

1879
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:26,500
It would.

1880
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:28,260
I need that for Jumis.

1881
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:29,260
All right.

1882
01:22:29,260 --> 01:22:33,180
Well, we're going to take a quick break here, but when we come back, there is plenty more

1883
01:22:33,180 --> 01:22:36,100
Orange Lounge Radio to come, including your emails.

1884
01:22:36,100 --> 01:22:38,460
If we have any this week, we actually might not.

1885
01:22:38,460 --> 01:22:42,620
Also we're going to get to the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

1886
01:22:42,620 --> 01:22:45,120
And we'll talk a little bit about news with the Xbox.

1887
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:47,180
We'll talk about a big lawsuit going on.

1888
01:22:47,180 --> 01:22:48,680
Somebody posted about that to Discord.

1889
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:52,840
We'll talk about that, which, Ooh, by the way, join our Discord, uh, vognetwork.com

1890
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:53,840
slash Discord.

1891
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:57,480
Uh, and, and most importantly, we'll talk about the Golden Girls.

1892
01:22:57,480 --> 01:23:01,240
When we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1893
01:23:07,680 --> 01:23:10,860
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

1894
01:23:10,860 --> 01:23:16,940
Live tonight, episode number 711 already in progress for this December the 17th of

1895
01:23:16,940 --> 01:23:17,940
2017.

1896
01:23:17,940 --> 01:23:23,880
It is the last Orange Lounge Radio of the year, sad face, but you know, we have holidays

1897
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:24,880
coming up.

1898
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:25,880
So happy face, I guess.

1899
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:26,880
All right.

1900
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:30,380
So anyway, uh, let's get into this here.

1901
01:23:30,380 --> 01:23:34,820
This is something where, um, we actually have another present here in studio.

1902
01:23:34,820 --> 01:23:38,060
This one, I believe, I don't know if your cat is a gift.

1903
01:23:38,060 --> 01:23:39,060
I don't.

1904
01:23:39,060 --> 01:23:40,060
Oh, Mr. Smoosh.

1905
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:41,140
Mr. Smoosh to humanity.

1906
01:23:41,140 --> 01:23:42,420
He is actually like the best holiday gift.

1907
01:23:42,420 --> 01:23:44,180
He's a precious little chocolate cinnamon roll.

1908
01:23:44,180 --> 01:23:45,180
Yeah, he's great.

1909
01:23:45,180 --> 01:23:46,180
Except for when he tries to...

1910
01:23:46,180 --> 01:23:47,780
Especially because his face looks like a cinnamon roll.

1911
01:23:47,780 --> 01:23:50,060
Especially when he tries to claw things that aren't his.

1912
01:23:50,060 --> 01:23:52,200
That's when he's not so precious, but that's all right.

1913
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:57,020
So anyway, um, so I believe this box in studio here is from actdeft.

1914
01:23:57,020 --> 01:24:02,940
So we could JD, I asked JD to open it so that all we had to do is take the cover off and

1915
01:24:02,940 --> 01:24:03,940
see what it is.

1916
01:24:03,940 --> 01:24:04,940
So let's do it.

1917
01:24:04,940 --> 01:24:05,940
Open it.

1918
01:24:05,940 --> 01:24:06,940
Oh shit.

1919
01:24:06,940 --> 01:24:07,940
Fuck me.

1920
01:24:07,940 --> 01:24:08,940
What is this?

1921
01:24:08,940 --> 01:24:09,940
Like cereal?

1922
01:24:10,820 --> 01:24:11,820
What is this?

1923
01:24:11,820 --> 01:24:13,820
You said something about this on a previous episode.

1924
01:24:13,820 --> 01:24:15,740
Oh yes.

1925
01:24:15,740 --> 01:24:24,900
He actually sent us hazelnut Oreos from Mexico, which I believe came up in a prior episode

1926
01:24:24,900 --> 01:24:25,900
of the show.

1927
01:24:25,900 --> 01:24:26,900
He sent me some before too.

1928
01:24:26,900 --> 01:24:27,900
Oh my God.

1929
01:24:27,900 --> 01:24:28,900
These are going to be great.

1930
01:24:28,900 --> 01:24:29,900
What a nice boy.

1931
01:24:29,900 --> 01:24:31,700
And he says, this is the last week I can eat sweets like this.

1932
01:24:31,700 --> 01:24:34,860
He sent four boxes so we can each take one.

1933
01:24:34,860 --> 01:24:36,660
I guess you get a Christmas gift too, JD.

1934
01:24:36,660 --> 01:24:37,660
How about that?

1935
01:24:37,660 --> 01:24:38,660
You can thank actdeft for that.

1936
01:24:38,660 --> 01:24:39,660
How about that?

1937
01:24:40,380 --> 01:24:41,380
Or maybe it was supposed to be for Alan.

1938
01:24:41,380 --> 01:24:42,380
I don't know.

1939
01:24:42,380 --> 01:24:43,380
I mean, if it'll fit in my backpack.

1940
01:24:43,380 --> 01:24:44,380
Sure.

1941
01:24:44,380 --> 01:24:45,380
There you go.

1942
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:46,380
Otherwise we'll just give it to Alan.

1943
01:24:46,380 --> 01:24:47,380
I'll fit this in my mouth.

1944
01:24:47,380 --> 01:24:48,380
All right.

1945
01:24:48,380 --> 01:24:49,380
I'm looking at it right now.

1946
01:24:49,380 --> 01:24:50,380
Watch me.

1947
01:24:50,380 --> 01:24:51,380
Watch me.

1948
01:24:51,380 --> 01:24:52,380
Thank you actdeft.

1949
01:24:52,380 --> 01:24:53,380
That's great.

1950
01:24:53,380 --> 01:24:54,380
Hazelnut Oreos.

1951
01:24:54,380 --> 01:24:58,540
Do they have all the crazy Oreo flavors down there that we get up here?

1952
01:24:58,540 --> 01:25:01,780
Like oh, they're in like individual serving packs.

1953
01:25:01,780 --> 01:25:02,780
That's kind of neat.

1954
01:25:02,780 --> 01:25:06,260
I actually saw a news article saying we might actually get the hazelnut ones domestically

1955
01:25:06,260 --> 01:25:07,260
in a couple of months.

1956
01:25:07,260 --> 01:25:08,980
It's weird that we don't already have them.

1957
01:25:09,300 --> 01:25:10,300
Yeah.

1958
01:25:10,300 --> 01:25:11,300
Okay.

1959
01:25:11,300 --> 01:25:12,300
I've never had these hazelnut Oreos.

1960
01:25:12,300 --> 01:25:13,300
Are you going to give me one?

1961
01:25:13,300 --> 01:25:14,300
Okay.

1962
01:25:14,300 --> 01:25:22,140
Well, if I don't usually listen to the ladies that anyway, here it is.

1963
01:25:22,140 --> 01:25:23,700
The cookie tastes different.

1964
01:25:23,700 --> 01:25:25,260
Oh my God.

1965
01:25:25,260 --> 01:25:26,260
Yeah.

1966
01:25:26,260 --> 01:25:28,620
The cookie doesn't the cookie taste different to you?

1967
01:25:28,620 --> 01:25:30,100
It tastes like real chocolate.

1968
01:25:30,100 --> 01:25:31,100
Yeah.

1969
01:25:31,100 --> 01:25:32,100
That's very different.

1970
01:25:32,100 --> 01:25:33,580
I like it though.

1971
01:25:33,580 --> 01:25:36,100
Maybe it's not made with high fructose corn syrup.

1972
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:37,500
Maybe not.

1973
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:38,500
It's made with real corn.

1974
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:39,500
All right.

1975
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:43,580
It's so fucking good.

1976
01:25:43,580 --> 01:25:46,540
We're breaking all the rules of how you're supposed to do a podcast.

1977
01:25:46,540 --> 01:25:48,660
You know, they're like, don't eat when you do a podcast.

1978
01:25:48,660 --> 01:25:49,660
Well, you know what?

1979
01:25:49,660 --> 01:25:52,380
I'm sorry.

1980
01:25:52,380 --> 01:25:55,060
Podcasters that think they're better than us.

1981
01:25:55,060 --> 01:25:56,460
I got a challenge for you.

1982
01:25:56,460 --> 01:25:58,700
I'm going to set these hazelnut Oreos down in front of you.

1983
01:25:58,700 --> 01:26:00,700
Don't do Patreon then.

1984
01:26:00,700 --> 01:26:01,700
Don't go there.

1985
01:26:01,700 --> 01:26:03,900
Are you going to do the ASMR crunching on the microphone?

1986
01:26:03,900 --> 01:26:04,900
Yeah.

1987
01:26:04,900 --> 01:26:05,900
It's just an ASMR show.

1988
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:06,900
Yeah.

1989
01:26:06,900 --> 01:26:07,900
You can't hear me crunching.

1990
01:26:07,900 --> 01:26:08,900
Okay.

1991
01:26:08,900 --> 01:26:18,300
What I'm going to do now is I'm going to eat a hazelnut Oreo and I'm going to do it slow

1992
01:26:18,300 --> 01:26:23,140
so that I can actually savor every little bite.

1993
01:26:23,140 --> 01:26:25,340
That's just annoying.

1994
01:26:25,340 --> 01:26:26,340
All right.

1995
01:26:26,340 --> 01:26:27,340
Anyway.

1996
01:26:27,340 --> 01:26:32,060
That'll give a shit because I have hazelnut.

1997
01:26:32,060 --> 01:26:34,340
Let's get back into some rapid fire news.

1998
01:26:34,340 --> 01:26:37,380
Loki save us by talking about some actual video games.

1999
01:26:37,380 --> 01:26:38,380
Okay.

2000
01:26:38,380 --> 01:26:44,140
So we talked a little bit about PUBG earlier and how they were bitching about, you know,

2001
01:26:44,140 --> 01:26:46,580
people copying their style.

2002
01:26:46,580 --> 01:26:52,380
Well, this is one style I don't want copied and that's, well, the Xbox one version.

2003
01:26:52,380 --> 01:26:58,900
So apparently at the very least you get, um, if you purchase your Xbox one, um, starting

2004
01:26:58,900 --> 01:27:03,460
December 17th and I don't know how long this is running, I think maybe through the end

2005
01:27:03,460 --> 01:27:08,300
of the year or something like that, but you'll get a complimentary copy of the Xbox one version

2006
01:27:08,300 --> 01:27:11,540
of PUBG with your game or game system.

2007
01:27:11,540 --> 01:27:12,540
So that's kind of cool.

2008
01:27:12,540 --> 01:27:13,660
At least you get a game.

2009
01:27:13,660 --> 01:27:19,300
The only downside to that is apparently the game runs like shit on the Xbox one X and

2010
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:23,540
Xbox one S, um, sub 30 FPS.

2011
01:27:23,540 --> 01:27:30,540
So that's not good considering that this game is kind of like Microsoft's like fucking flagship

2012
01:27:30,540 --> 01:27:31,540
right now.

2013
01:27:31,540 --> 01:27:35,780
It's like I actually logged into mixer cause they updated on my phone and they were like,

2014
01:27:35,780 --> 01:27:36,780
Oh, it's a whole new space.

2015
01:27:36,780 --> 01:27:38,460
I looked at, it's like, it's all fucking PUBG.

2016
01:27:38,460 --> 01:27:44,420
It's all PUBG, not all, but I have some serious streaming asset issues with the game.

2017
01:27:44,420 --> 01:27:49,380
I mean, there's, they were showing, I guess a digital foundry had done like a whole, uh,

2018
01:27:49,380 --> 01:27:51,300
frame rate analysis of it.

2019
01:27:51,300 --> 01:27:56,260
And I guess it was dipping on the Xbox one S I think doing like the skydiving portion

2020
01:27:56,260 --> 01:27:57,260
or whatever.

2021
01:27:57,260 --> 01:28:01,500
It's like down to like four FPS, you know, it's ridiculously low.

2022
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:07,300
So that sucks, but Hey, at least it's free and you know what, it's not always going to

2023
01:28:07,300 --> 01:28:08,300
be like that forever.

2024
01:28:08,300 --> 01:28:11,220
I mean, they are going to fix the game eventually.

2025
01:28:11,220 --> 01:28:12,220
I hope.

2026
01:28:12,220 --> 01:28:15,500
Um, and it is technically an early access.

2027
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:19,260
That's really silly being that this is a console game, but you know, that's a new thing that

2028
01:28:19,260 --> 01:28:23,300
consoles want to do now is, Hey, it also got nominated for game of the year.

2029
01:28:23,300 --> 01:28:24,300
So that's true.

2030
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:27,980
Uh, it's like, Hey, well I mean, and don't get me wrong if you want to play the game

2031
01:28:27,980 --> 01:28:31,340
and you have your choice playing on PC, but Hey, if you're getting it for free,

2032
01:28:31,820 --> 01:28:32,820
why not?

2033
01:28:32,820 --> 01:28:39,020
Um, and then, um, news that will definitely please Bobby black Wolf.

2034
01:28:39,020 --> 01:28:42,020
There's been a two month delay for Nino Cooney too.

2035
01:28:42,020 --> 01:28:43,020
He will.

2036
01:28:43,020 --> 01:28:46,460
He won't be satisfied until it's canceled, but for the rest of us, so it'll be out on

2037
01:28:46,460 --> 01:28:51,780
March 23rd, 2018 they don't really list a reason why I assume is because their demo

2038
01:28:51,780 --> 01:28:53,580
was pretty bad.

2039
01:28:53,580 --> 01:28:54,580
What did he know?

2040
01:28:54,580 --> 01:28:57,820
Cooney to get a demo to no, but you know, they're developing it.

2041
01:28:57,820 --> 01:28:58,820
Yeah, yeah, I get it.

2042
01:28:58,820 --> 01:28:59,820
I get it.

2043
01:29:00,140 --> 01:29:04,100
Maybe there was just some fatal error that, cause the game would have needed to go gold

2044
01:29:04,100 --> 01:29:05,100
around this week.

2045
01:29:05,100 --> 01:29:06,100
So maybe some fatal error.

2046
01:29:06,100 --> 01:29:10,940
Well yeah, originally it was scheduled for, um, the fall and then scheduled for January

2047
01:29:10,940 --> 01:29:16,140
and now it's March 23rd pushing it back and back.

2048
01:29:16,140 --> 01:29:21,140
Well, Hey, as long, as long as it's quality, a good game is good forever, blah, blah, blah,

2049
01:29:21,140 --> 01:29:22,140
blah, blah.

2050
01:29:22,140 --> 01:29:26,340
As long as while we can beat the demo, I think this time they just aren't going to fucking

2051
01:29:26,340 --> 01:29:28,180
do a demo and then they'll say, how do you like that?

2052
01:29:28,180 --> 01:29:32,060
Bobby Black Wolf, since you complained about demos, we're just not going to do one.

2053
01:29:32,060 --> 01:29:33,060
You ruined it single-handedly.

2054
01:29:33,060 --> 01:29:34,580
I'm just kidding.

2055
01:29:34,580 --> 01:29:35,580
It was a terrible demo.

2056
01:29:35,580 --> 01:29:37,420
The game was much better than the demo.

2057
01:29:37,420 --> 01:29:38,420
All right.

2058
01:29:38,420 --> 01:29:41,020
Anyhow, let's move on and talk about Squeenix.

2059
01:29:41,020 --> 01:29:44,620
This is something I think we all like is old Squeenix titles, right?

2060
01:29:44,620 --> 01:29:47,100
Even Bobby can agree old Squeenix titles are cool.

2061
01:29:47,100 --> 01:29:53,020
Uh, anyhow, this was a comment from Iosuke Matsuda in a, an interview with a publication

2062
01:29:53,020 --> 01:29:55,140
out of the UK MCV.

2063
01:29:55,180 --> 01:30:00,460
One of our other big initiatives is to get as many of our past titles available via digital

2064
01:30:00,460 --> 01:30:01,460
release.

2065
01:30:01,460 --> 01:30:04,660
Among the younger generations of gamers, you've got lots of people out there who may have

2066
01:30:04,660 --> 01:30:09,100
heard of our past titles, but have never had an opportunity to play them.

2067
01:30:09,100 --> 01:30:13,460
So we think that program of porting and transferring the older titles over to newer platforms such

2068
01:30:13,460 --> 01:30:18,900
as the switch is very important so that people get that awareness of our back catalog.

2069
01:30:18,900 --> 01:30:21,660
Just straight port is in our cutting it.

2070
01:30:21,700 --> 01:30:25,660
We need to update those and modernize them to make something that works for modern gamers

2071
01:30:25,660 --> 01:30:30,560
to do that port of final fantasy four that was only on the Vita that was really good

2072
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:34,140
because it was still like the 2d Sprite thing, but it was like new.

2073
01:30:34,140 --> 01:30:38,260
It wasn't the 3d remake or even like, was it, I think it was the PSP final fantasy games

2074
01:30:38,260 --> 01:30:39,260
too.

2075
01:30:39,260 --> 01:30:40,260
That's what I meant.

2076
01:30:40,260 --> 01:30:41,260
Sorry.

2077
01:30:41,260 --> 01:30:42,260
Not PS Vita, PSP final fantasy four.

2078
01:30:42,260 --> 01:30:44,340
The PSP ones were good because they were still 2d and stuff.

2079
01:30:44,340 --> 01:30:45,340
One and two.

2080
01:30:45,340 --> 01:30:46,340
Yeah.

2081
01:30:46,340 --> 01:30:48,060
One and two were just Final Fantasy origins I think all the way back on PlayStation.

2082
01:30:48,060 --> 01:30:49,060
Yeah.

2083
01:30:49,060 --> 01:30:51,620
They also had like, was it like, didn't they have like some dungeon or something?

2084
01:30:51,620 --> 01:30:53,340
It was like randomly generated.

2085
01:30:53,340 --> 01:30:55,300
I believe that was in four.

2086
01:30:55,300 --> 01:30:59,980
They had like a random dungeon, but anyway, do, do put, I doubt a lot of people got to

2087
01:30:59,980 --> 01:31:03,620
play that on the Vita, put that version out on the switch, but I worry that they'll stick

2088
01:31:03,620 --> 01:31:05,180
with that 3d version.

2089
01:31:05,180 --> 01:31:06,180
That's the 3ds.

2090
01:31:06,180 --> 01:31:07,980
And it's, it's okay.

2091
01:31:07,980 --> 01:31:12,660
I mean, if obviously four is still a great game, but I just, I don't know.

2092
01:31:12,660 --> 01:31:16,960
I feel like the 3d is too much, but that's, that's my concern there anyway.

2093
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:18,100
So that's pretty cool though.

2094
01:31:18,100 --> 01:31:21,300
And uh, excited to hear about some of the older Squeenix titles.

2095
01:31:21,300 --> 01:31:23,340
Now here's my, here's my real suggestion though.

2096
01:31:23,340 --> 01:31:24,340
Okay.

2097
01:31:24,340 --> 01:31:25,420
We can talk about fantasy all we want.

2098
01:31:25,420 --> 01:31:26,420
Here's the thing.

2099
01:31:26,420 --> 01:31:30,780
Squeenix, we call them Squeenix because they're square enix, right?

2100
01:31:30,780 --> 01:31:34,900
How about you fucking dip into the enix catalog and give us some of that shit.

2101
01:31:34,900 --> 01:31:38,660
Like how about the like soul blazer illusion of Gaia.

2102
01:31:38,660 --> 01:31:44,560
Do that or even better, uh, the bust a groove slash bust a move games, depending on what

2103
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:45,560
country you lived in.

2104
01:31:45,560 --> 01:31:47,620
How about those games re-imagined on switch?

2105
01:31:47,620 --> 01:31:48,940
That would be cool.

2106
01:31:48,940 --> 01:31:50,820
So right, Jamie?

2107
01:31:50,820 --> 01:31:51,820
Hell yeah.

2108
01:31:51,820 --> 01:31:52,820
Hell yeah.

2109
01:31:52,820 --> 01:31:54,180
And how about a new one while we're at it?

2110
01:31:54,180 --> 01:31:55,180
Be nice.

2111
01:31:55,180 --> 01:31:56,540
All right.

2112
01:31:56,540 --> 01:32:00,140
Also looking to dip into the vault, Capcom is saying that they are looking to port more

2113
01:32:00,140 --> 01:32:01,780
games for the Nintendo switch.

2114
01:32:01,780 --> 01:32:06,380
Uh, this was, uh, something, uh, that was picked up via Twitter, uh, and then an interview

2115
01:32:06,380 --> 01:32:12,540
that Capcom CEO Tsujimoto did with the Nikkei saying the home and portable concept works

2116
01:32:12,540 --> 01:32:17,420
better than expected and Capcom wants to port games to the switch that were not available

2117
01:32:17,420 --> 01:32:19,660
on Nintendo consoles previously.

2118
01:32:19,660 --> 01:32:23,740
So here's hoping that Disney morning show thing makes it cause I still haven't bought

2119
01:32:23,740 --> 01:32:28,020
that waiting for the switch version and we know the Mega Man games are coming, so we'll

2120
01:32:28,020 --> 01:32:30,040
see what else maybe of the old school.

2121
01:32:30,040 --> 01:32:31,940
How about Power Stone?

2122
01:32:31,940 --> 01:32:37,600
What I really want is the Phoenix Wright game that never got released in North America.

2123
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:40,940
I realize that's translation and not porting, but that would be nice.

2124
01:32:40,940 --> 01:32:41,940
You never know.

2125
01:32:41,940 --> 01:32:42,940
Never know.

2126
01:32:42,940 --> 01:32:43,940
All right.

2127
01:32:43,940 --> 01:32:48,860
Uh, and lastly, let's talk about Dissidia NT because Dissidia NT is coming out January

2128
01:32:48,860 --> 01:32:52,460
11th in Japan and January 30th in the West.

2129
01:32:52,460 --> 01:32:58,000
All 28 fighters in the game have been announced at this point, including the cloud of darkness

2130
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,460
among some other villains as well.

2131
01:33:00,460 --> 01:33:05,940
Uh, we have Ramza from Final Fantasy Tactics, Ace from Final Fantasy Type Zero and Noctis

2132
01:33:05,940 --> 01:33:07,260
also got in the game.

2133
01:33:07,260 --> 01:33:09,500
Do we get gold farmers from Final Fantasy 11?

2134
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:10,500
Here we go.

2135
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:11,500
Here's, here's the list.

2136
01:33:11,500 --> 01:33:16,220
All the characters in Dissidia from Final Fantasy one, the Warrior of Light and Garland

2137
01:33:16,220 --> 01:33:21,280
from Final Fantasy two, Furion and the Emperor from Final Fantasy three, the Onion Knight

2138
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:26,580
and the Cloud of Darkness from Final Fantasy four, Cecil, Kane from Final Fantasy five,

2139
01:33:26,580 --> 01:33:27,580
Golbez.

2140
01:33:27,580 --> 01:33:29,140
Golbez was in four, not five.

2141
01:33:29,140 --> 01:33:31,100
Or was there also a character named Golbez in five?

2142
01:33:31,100 --> 01:33:32,540
I think this list might be wrong.

2143
01:33:32,540 --> 01:33:36,500
Uh, Bartz was definitely a five character though, as was Exdeath and then from Final

2144
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:42,740
Fantasy six, Terra and Kefka from Final Fantasy seven, Cloud and Sephiroth from Final Fantasy

2145
01:33:42,740 --> 01:33:49,060
eight, Squall and Ultimicia from Final Fantasy nine, Zidane and Kuja from Final Fantasy ten,

2146
01:33:49,060 --> 01:33:52,700
Tidus and Jecht from Final Fantasy 11, Shantotto.

2147
01:33:52,700 --> 01:33:55,700
And that's it because Shantotto is the only Final Fantasy 11 character that ever shows

2148
01:33:55,700 --> 01:33:56,700
up anywhere else.

2149
01:33:56,700 --> 01:34:02,500
From Final Fantasy 12, Van, okay, Square.

2150
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:07,740
Why Van and not Balthier or Fran or Balthier and Fran?

2151
01:34:07,740 --> 01:34:08,740
Why?

2152
01:34:08,740 --> 01:34:09,740
Square?

2153
01:34:09,740 --> 01:34:10,740
Why?

2154
01:34:10,740 --> 01:34:11,740
No, I want a fucking reason.

2155
01:34:11,740 --> 01:34:13,540
I want a show until Square answers me.

2156
01:34:13,540 --> 01:34:15,100
Why not Balthier or Fran?

2157
01:34:15,100 --> 01:34:20,580
I'll take, I'll take, uh, I'll take what's going to be in the DLC for 500 Alex.

2158
01:34:20,580 --> 01:34:23,420
Bing, bing, bing, okay.

2159
01:34:23,420 --> 01:34:25,940
Loki answered on your behalf Square Enix.

2160
01:34:25,940 --> 01:34:27,140
The listeners have been saved.

2161
01:34:27,140 --> 01:34:33,900
From Final Fantasy 13, Lightning, from Final Fantasy 14, Ishtola, and from 15, Noctis,

2162
01:34:33,900 --> 01:34:39,820
and then type zero has Ace and Tactics has Ramza, Ramza, I said Ramma, no unfortunately

2163
01:34:39,820 --> 01:34:44,700
Ramna will not, Ramna will not be in the game, but Ramza seriously out, out skilled

2164
01:34:44,700 --> 01:34:45,700
there.

2165
01:34:45,700 --> 01:34:47,020
What the hell am I doing here?

2166
01:34:47,020 --> 01:34:48,300
He'll kill them all.

2167
01:34:48,300 --> 01:34:54,740
All right, anyway, uh, moving on, let's get to some other news, uh, Dark Sakura for rapid

2168
01:34:54,740 --> 01:34:55,860
fire news.

2169
01:34:55,860 --> 01:35:02,580
Um, there is a survey recently put out on, uh, about a UK video game companies.

2170
01:35:02,580 --> 01:35:08,300
It says that 29% of them have been damaged by Brexit, um, that it's really taken a big

2171
01:35:08,340 --> 01:35:11,300
hit into, uh, the gaming industry there.

2172
01:35:11,300 --> 01:35:16,140
They're saying that, uh, this is based off of a sample of 63 game businesses, including

2173
01:35:16,140 --> 01:35:18,220
small, medium, and large companies.

2174
01:35:18,220 --> 01:35:23,020
And 29% of the respondents feel like their process, uh, feel like the process has been

2175
01:35:23,020 --> 01:35:28,940
particularly damaged, damaging to them because of how it impacts recruitment and retention.

2176
01:35:28,940 --> 01:35:30,940
So, bah.

2177
01:35:30,940 --> 01:35:34,700
Then again, about 11% of them believe that it's been favorable, but we don't care what

2178
01:35:34,700 --> 01:35:36,020
they think.

2179
01:35:36,020 --> 01:35:46,900
So moving forward, um, we also have, uh, on December 22nd in Japan, there will be a versus

2180
01:35:46,900 --> 01:35:50,660
Super Mario Brothers will be arriving on the Switch eShop.

2181
01:35:50,660 --> 01:35:58,220
Um, it will be 823 yen, so it's about 799 in the US and it will have new and remixed

2182
01:35:58,220 --> 01:36:01,300
content from the original.

2183
01:36:01,300 --> 01:36:03,380
I'm actually kind of excited about this.

2184
01:36:03,380 --> 01:36:04,380
Yes.

2185
01:36:04,380 --> 01:36:08,060
Cause the closest thing we have to virtual console on the Switch right now, but it is

2186
01:36:08,060 --> 01:36:11,660
kind of neat that it's like the arcade one, which is a little harder, you know?

2187
01:36:11,660 --> 01:36:13,220
It was, it was a remix.

2188
01:36:13,220 --> 01:36:14,220
Yes.

2189
01:36:14,220 --> 01:36:15,220
Yes.

2190
01:36:15,220 --> 01:36:16,220
It will be even mixier.

2191
01:36:16,220 --> 01:36:17,220
That's right.

2192
01:36:17,220 --> 01:36:21,500
Let's, uh, mix up some release dates and talk about what's coming out to a video game store

2193
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:22,500
near you.

2194
01:36:22,500 --> 01:36:24,700
Although I imagine this week is going to get a little dull, right?

2195
01:36:24,700 --> 01:36:25,700
Um, yeah.

2196
01:36:25,700 --> 01:36:29,820
So I'm just going to cover what's up for the rest of the year since it's really not a whole

2197
01:36:29,820 --> 01:36:31,460
ton of stuff.

2198
01:36:31,460 --> 01:36:34,780
And none of these I'm really recognizing except for Life is Strange.

2199
01:36:34,780 --> 01:36:35,980
So we'll start there.

2200
01:36:35,980 --> 01:36:38,700
Life is Strange before the storm episode three.

2201
01:36:38,700 --> 01:36:41,500
That's going to be coming out on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox one.

2202
01:36:41,500 --> 01:36:46,580
We have a game called Dragon Fang Z, the Rose and Dungeon of Time.

2203
01:36:46,580 --> 01:36:54,020
That's coming out on the Switch, defunct on PS4 and Xbox one, uh, Slice Dice and Rice.

2204
01:36:54,020 --> 01:36:55,020
I love that title.

2205
01:36:55,020 --> 01:36:57,580
I don't know what it is, but I want to know more about it.

2206
01:36:57,580 --> 01:37:03,580
Uh, that's coming out on PlayStation four, um, Blossom tales, the sleeping King on Nintendo

2207
01:37:03,580 --> 01:37:10,260
switch, a tiny metal that's going to be out on PC switch and PlayStation four.

2208
01:37:10,260 --> 01:37:18,500
And finally on Christmas day, style savvy styling star on the three D S. Um, that's,

2209
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:20,220
that's gotta be some weird placeholder day.

2210
01:37:20,220 --> 01:37:21,820
You don't release games on Christmas day.

2211
01:37:21,820 --> 01:37:23,700
I don't think it's actually coming out that day.

2212
01:37:23,700 --> 01:37:24,700
Maybe digital.

2213
01:37:25,700 --> 01:37:33,740
It could be a digital, but I, I, yeah, I doubt that it's that, uh, Oh, well that's okay.

2214
01:37:33,740 --> 01:37:38,660
Listen, this is a U S release state, you know, site.

2215
01:37:38,660 --> 01:37:43,260
Why is there a subtitle or a little footnote here saying this release date is only for

2216
01:37:43,260 --> 01:37:45,000
Japan only.

2217
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:48,260
That is misleading because this is supposed to be for North America.

2218
01:37:48,260 --> 01:37:53,340
It's some, some, and Slice Dice and Rice is a fucking amazing name of a game.

2219
01:37:53,980 --> 01:37:54,980
I am very disappointed.

2220
01:37:54,980 --> 01:37:55,980
Sorry to hear it.

2221
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:58,100
Well, let's talk about what else is coming out in Japan because there are some releases

2222
01:37:58,100 --> 01:37:59,100
still this week.

2223
01:37:59,100 --> 01:38:01,820
Uh, Christmas is in Japan, but it's a little different.

2224
01:38:01,820 --> 01:38:02,820
Okay.

2225
01:38:02,820 --> 01:38:03,820
There, there may be cake involved.

2226
01:38:03,820 --> 01:38:08,340
So, um, but, uh, we still have some releases coming out this week in Japan, including on

2227
01:38:08,340 --> 01:38:09,340
the PlayStation four.

2228
01:38:09,340 --> 01:38:16,940
Ottlier, uh, Liddy and Sawyer, Fushigi, not Kaiga, no Renkin Jutsu samurai comes out.

2229
01:38:16,940 --> 01:38:19,980
That's basically another Ottlier game, uh, that is out this week.

2230
01:38:20,020 --> 01:38:23,540
Okami, uh, Zekai Ban comes out on the PlayStation four this week.

2231
01:38:23,540 --> 01:38:26,820
So that of course is the Okami, um, remaster on PlayStation four.

2232
01:38:26,820 --> 01:38:28,220
That is also on December 21st.

2233
01:38:28,220 --> 01:38:32,160
If you are an idol master fan, which I'm sure Loki is, you can look forward to Stella stage

2234
01:38:32,160 --> 01:38:33,680
is out this week.

2235
01:38:33,680 --> 01:38:38,140
And if you are more of a, a train type of per type of person, if Misty's out there somewhere,

2236
01:38:38,140 --> 01:38:42,980
uh, you can check out a train day equal, which I think is actually an expansion or at least

2237
01:38:42,980 --> 01:38:43,980
they call it exp.

2238
01:38:43,980 --> 01:38:47,860
So maybe that's just part of the name, but another, a train game available on PlayStation

2239
01:38:47,860 --> 01:38:48,860
four.

2240
01:38:48,860 --> 01:38:54,180
So, um, put those games out, um, here in the U S like, or at least try, like, I guess maybe

2241
01:38:54,180 --> 01:38:55,180
they just don't want to localize them.

2242
01:38:55,180 --> 01:38:56,180
I don't know.

2243
01:38:56,180 --> 01:39:00,180
The Vita still has games that Ottlier game is also out on the Vita this week, as well

2244
01:39:00,180 --> 01:39:05,620
as the game called code realize Shirogane no Kisuke comes out this week on the PlayStation

2245
01:39:05,620 --> 01:39:06,620
Vita.

2246
01:39:06,620 --> 01:39:10,340
And then looking over to the Nintendo switch, that Ottlier game is also on the Nintendo

2247
01:39:10,340 --> 01:39:16,060
switch and one piece Kaizuko Musou three deluxe edition is also out on the switch this week

2248
01:39:16,060 --> 01:39:18,980
on December, uh, 21st.

2249
01:39:18,980 --> 01:39:25,640
And then lastly on the three DS Medarot classics, there's a Kabuto version, a Kuwagata version

2250
01:39:25,640 --> 01:39:28,280
and a 20th anniversary edition.

2251
01:39:28,280 --> 01:39:32,820
All those are out on the three DS this week, all from Imagineer.

2252
01:39:32,820 --> 01:39:33,820
So you can check that out.

2253
01:39:33,820 --> 01:39:37,320
And those look like they look like Gameboy games kind of reimagined on the three DS.

2254
01:39:37,320 --> 01:39:39,740
So that's kind of neat.

2255
01:39:39,740 --> 01:39:43,080
All right, let's move on to the UK dark Sakura.

2256
01:39:43,080 --> 01:39:46,760
There's only one thing with a date on it, and that's December 27th, the steam world

2257
01:39:46,760 --> 01:39:49,360
heist on switch.

2258
01:39:49,360 --> 01:39:50,360
There it is.

2259
01:39:50,360 --> 01:39:51,360
That's it.

2260
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:52,360
All right.

2261
01:39:52,360 --> 01:39:57,080
Well, let's, uh, we, well, actually I rage said he resend an email during the break.

2262
01:39:57,080 --> 01:39:59,040
So I don't know if you want to jump in the email bag or whatever.

2263
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:00,440
I'll try if I can get it to work.

2264
01:40:00,440 --> 01:40:01,880
Remember it wasn't working.

2265
01:40:01,880 --> 01:40:02,880
That's true.

2266
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:03,880
It wasn't working.

2267
01:40:03,880 --> 01:40:04,880
I have it here.

2268
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:06,560
I can always read it if we need to, but we are going to, uh, take a trip into the mail

2269
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:08,200
bag.

2270
01:40:08,200 --> 01:40:12,340
When you guys send us emails, participate at orange lounge radio.com is the place to

2271
01:40:12,340 --> 01:40:13,340
send us emails.

2272
01:40:13,340 --> 01:40:17,900
I have to get logged back in and dark Sakura will usually dive into the mail bag headfirst

2273
01:40:17,900 --> 01:40:20,500
and find some emails to read for us tonight.

2274
01:40:20,500 --> 01:40:25,380
I had it closed and we're going to get this one email here and then I will encourage you

2275
01:40:25,380 --> 01:40:28,260
guys of course to email us even though we're not going to be live for a few weeks.

2276
01:40:28,260 --> 01:40:31,540
We can always read your email when we get back and we do have a bonus show.

2277
01:40:31,540 --> 01:40:33,820
That's going to be during the break.

2278
01:40:33,820 --> 01:40:34,820
Okay, great.

2279
01:40:34,820 --> 01:40:35,820
Yeah.

2280
01:40:35,820 --> 01:40:40,100
So starting from reginator, hi all it's reginator.

2281
01:40:40,100 --> 01:40:42,700
I just wanted to give you all a quick heads up.

2282
01:40:42,700 --> 01:40:46,340
As you probably noticed by now, I'm not in chat to listen to bobby's or your shows.

2283
01:40:46,340 --> 01:40:51,460
Unfortunately that can't be helped the hero king, but I think means long and short of

2284
01:40:51,460 --> 01:40:56,580
it is that my video card issues have gotten far worse and my PC is currently and effectively

2285
01:40:56,580 --> 01:41:01,460
unusable until I can come up with the money to get a new video card found on my current

2286
01:41:01,460 --> 01:41:03,460
one completely died.

2287
01:41:03,460 --> 01:41:07,540
Just to get something that I know will work in my PC and is relatively cheap.

2288
01:41:07,540 --> 01:41:09,300
I'll be getting the same thing.

2289
01:41:09,300 --> 01:41:13,220
It's currently in my PC and Nvidia Geforce GT 610.

2290
01:41:13,220 --> 01:41:15,820
However it will take some time to gather up the money and get one.

2291
01:41:15,820 --> 01:41:21,000
That being said, for the time being I will have to rely on my local library's PC to access

2292
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:22,220
the internet and whatnot.

2293
01:41:22,220 --> 01:41:25,860
I try to rejoin the VoG community as soon as humanly possible.

2294
01:41:25,860 --> 01:41:31,940
As an aside, seeing as how I can't, I really can't do anything online from home for the

2295
01:41:31,940 --> 01:41:32,940
time being.

2296
01:41:32,940 --> 01:41:38,300
Dark Tetsuya is pretty much in charge of the raging deals steam group until things are

2297
01:41:38,300 --> 01:41:40,140
back up and running at home.

2298
01:41:40,140 --> 01:41:43,200
Anyway, I'll take care and talk to you all soon hopefully.

2299
01:41:43,200 --> 01:41:47,200
Well he's in chat now so he must have been able to fix some of those issues, but that's

2300
01:41:47,200 --> 01:41:49,100
probably a good call is to just go for it.

2301
01:41:49,100 --> 01:41:54,020
I mean the video card technology changes so fast that like buying what you have now is

2302
01:41:54,020 --> 01:41:56,580
probably going to be cheaper than what you paid for it then.

2303
01:41:56,580 --> 01:42:04,260
I may still have my old card which is a kick up from that and I'll talk to Dan about making

2304
01:42:04,260 --> 01:42:05,260
you a deal on it.

2305
01:42:05,260 --> 01:42:06,260
Ho ho ho.

2306
01:42:06,260 --> 01:42:07,260
There you go.

2307
01:42:07,260 --> 01:42:08,260
We'll see.

2308
01:42:08,260 --> 01:42:16,660
It's uh, I think uh, it's I think around like that same era of Geforce, but it's like

2309
01:42:16,660 --> 01:42:17,980
one of the black editions.

2310
01:42:17,980 --> 01:42:19,820
So it was pretty okay.

2311
01:42:19,820 --> 01:42:22,320
I was running wow on it and all the stuff.

2312
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:23,320
So

2313
01:42:23,320 --> 01:42:24,320
All right.

2314
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:25,320
All right.

2315
01:42:25,320 --> 01:42:31,780
Um, hello L R. Well hello Y Y R. In last week's mailbag Robert M mused about the possibility

2316
01:42:31,780 --> 01:42:34,400
of an intense horror game in an arcade.

2317
01:42:34,400 --> 01:42:35,400
Guess what?

2318
01:42:35,400 --> 01:42:36,560
This already exists.

2319
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:40,180
If you're in North America, get to your local Dave and busters and play Namco's dark escape

2320
01:42:40,180 --> 01:42:46,240
for D as a closed booth person, first person, two player mounted gun rail shooter that uses

2321
01:42:46,240 --> 01:42:51,760
three D glasses for and it just reloaded the email weird.

2322
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:52,760
That's weird.

2323
01:42:52,760 --> 01:42:58,460
Um, uh, and features tons of jump scares, loud noises and even blows air on you.

2324
01:42:58,460 --> 01:43:00,680
It's quite difficult but worth a play through.

2325
01:43:00,680 --> 01:43:01,680
Wait.

2326
01:43:01,680 --> 01:43:05,640
So Y Y R is recommending a game that will literally blow you.

2327
01:43:06,440 --> 01:43:07,440
The future is now.

2328
01:43:07,440 --> 01:43:08,440
Yes.

2329
01:43:08,440 --> 01:43:09,440
That's right.

2330
01:43:09,440 --> 01:43:10,440
Wow.

2331
01:43:10,440 --> 01:43:11,440
I live in the future.

2332
01:43:11,440 --> 01:43:14,760
Dave and busters isn't the only place you can find dark escape for D, but it's the most

2333
01:43:14,760 --> 01:43:15,760
common.

2334
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:20,600
The game is at all of their locations, but it will also be at other large arcades such

2335
01:43:20,600 --> 01:43:23,680
as round one and I've seen it in a random bowling alley too.

2336
01:43:23,680 --> 01:43:27,280
You should hopefully be able to find it wherever in the world you happen to be.

2337
01:43:27,280 --> 01:43:28,280
Enjoy Aaron.

2338
01:43:28,280 --> 01:43:29,280
Y Y R.

2339
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:31,980
Well thank you for the tip because obviously we didn't think of it and I had no idea something

2340
01:43:31,980 --> 01:43:32,980
like this existed.

2341
01:43:32,980 --> 01:43:35,600
Remember the AKB 48 game that we played at round one?

2342
01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:36,600
Yes.

2343
01:43:36,600 --> 01:43:40,340
That game is terrible and wonderful.

2344
01:43:40,340 --> 01:43:43,720
Is that also a survival horror game that you recommend?

2345
01:43:43,720 --> 01:43:45,480
If you want to laugh your ass off.

2346
01:43:45,480 --> 01:43:47,040
That's the one where they're like zombies, right?

2347
01:43:47,040 --> 01:43:48,040
Yeah.

2348
01:43:48,040 --> 01:43:49,040
That's pretty funny.

2349
01:43:49,040 --> 01:43:53,420
They're like still like, you know, for people who don't know, that's a girl group in Japan.

2350
01:43:53,420 --> 01:43:57,120
Like they're performing their number and you choose like one of them is like your friend

2351
01:43:57,120 --> 01:44:00,900
or something and they will just like in the middle of their number turn zombie and try

2352
01:44:00,900 --> 01:44:01,900
to eat your face.

2353
01:44:01,900 --> 01:44:04,440
Like it's the most surreal thing.

2354
01:44:04,440 --> 01:44:05,800
That sounds hilariously bad.

2355
01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:07,280
I kind of love it.

2356
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:08,280
Did you play it?

2357
01:44:08,280 --> 01:44:09,280
No, I didn't.

2358
01:44:09,280 --> 01:44:11,960
You guys were off giggling and playing it or something and I went and played something

2359
01:44:11,960 --> 01:44:12,960
else.

2360
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:16,800
Yeah, it's, it's, I was, I was, I was probably playing the gigantic keyboard game that gives

2361
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:17,840
you tickets.

2362
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:18,840
I love that.

2363
01:44:18,840 --> 01:44:19,840
I love that game.

2364
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:22,360
Cause I just spent, Oh my God, I have to share this.

2365
01:44:22,360 --> 01:44:23,360
Act Def'd.

2366
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:24,360
Kitty in a bet.

2367
01:44:24,360 --> 01:44:25,360
Please get a picture of that.

2368
01:44:25,360 --> 01:44:26,360
Okay.

2369
01:44:26,360 --> 01:44:32,000
So we opened Act Def's present and now Mr. Smoosh has decided to co-op the box and use

2370
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:36,220
the box for himself.

2371
01:44:36,220 --> 01:44:38,880
So just so you know, I got, I got a picture.

2372
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:39,880
You did get a picture.

2373
01:44:39,880 --> 01:44:42,640
Can you like tweet it out and retweet it or something?

2374
01:44:42,640 --> 01:44:43,640
So back.

2375
01:44:43,640 --> 01:44:44,640
Okay.

2376
01:44:44,640 --> 01:44:45,640
That's hilarious.

2377
01:44:45,640 --> 01:44:50,480
My fashion is that SSU 100 Matt says it's his box now.

2378
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:51,480
So there you go.

2379
01:44:51,480 --> 01:44:52,480
Yeah.

2380
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:55,680
Send me this tweet out the one where he's sitting in the box.

2381
01:44:55,680 --> 01:44:56,680
If you got that JD.

2382
01:44:56,680 --> 01:44:57,680
Yeah.

2383
01:44:57,680 --> 01:44:58,680
All right.

2384
01:44:58,680 --> 01:44:59,680
Looking in chat over at live.

2385
01:44:59,880 --> 01:45:00,880
Mr. Smoosh we love you.

2386
01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:02,200
You people are just writing it from him.

2387
01:45:02,200 --> 01:45:07,200
I will use this opportunity to give a cheap plug to Mr. Smoosh's Instagram account.

2388
01:45:07,200 --> 01:45:09,400
You can actually follow Mr. Smoosh on Instagram.

2389
01:45:09,400 --> 01:45:16,960
Mr. that spelled out M I S T E R S M O O S H. I almost said S M O O O S H. Mr. Smoosh.

2390
01:45:16,960 --> 01:45:17,960
There it is.

2391
01:45:17,960 --> 01:45:18,960
He's back.

2392
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:19,960
I have a look.

2393
01:45:19,960 --> 01:45:20,960
Okay.

2394
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:21,960
Get a good picture.

2395
01:45:21,960 --> 01:45:22,960
Smoosh's Instagram.

2396
01:45:22,960 --> 01:45:23,960
All right.

2397
01:45:23,960 --> 01:45:29,480
Now that Mr. Smoosh has derailed the show again, let's get back into some gaming news.

2398
01:45:29,480 --> 01:45:30,480
Email us.

2399
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:31,480
Participate at orange on trader.com.

2400
01:45:31,480 --> 01:45:32,480
Meanwhile, Loki.

2401
01:45:32,480 --> 01:45:33,480
All right.

2402
01:45:33,480 --> 01:45:42,280
So cry tech is actually suing the, uh, German, I guess the developer for star citizen.

2403
01:45:42,280 --> 01:45:48,800
So apparently, uh, cloud Imperium games, they said that there was a breach of contract.

2404
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:55,400
So it's basically let their lawsuits alleging that cloud Imperium games, uh, breaches contract

2405
01:45:55,400 --> 01:46:03,500
cry tech that was created when the two companies, I guess it partnered to, um, create star citizen.

2406
01:46:03,500 --> 01:46:12,040
And then I guess with that, they're saying that, um, apparently because of, I guess it

2407
01:46:12,040 --> 01:46:17,100
has to do with the, the engine because they did, um, put some money, I guess, towards

2408
01:46:17,100 --> 01:46:21,240
the game being developed using the cry tech engine, I guess in exchange cry tech, uh,

2409
01:46:21,240 --> 01:46:27,120
would provide marketing and engine support for, you know, their game, I guess over, over

2410
01:46:27,120 --> 01:46:32,960
the time against the relationship between the two companies broke down and now, um,

2411
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:37,120
the engine has, um, they've switched up the engine.

2412
01:46:37,120 --> 01:46:43,480
So now it switched to Amazon's lumber yard engine, which is based off of cry tech's engine.

2413
01:46:43,480 --> 01:46:48,320
And because I guess, so now they can't really, they put marketing behind the game, but now

2414
01:46:48,320 --> 01:46:51,720
that they're not using the cry tech engines, kind of like a waste of money.

2415
01:46:51,720 --> 01:46:53,680
And so there was an agreement that they're going to use their engine.

2416
01:46:53,680 --> 01:46:54,680
They didn't.

2417
01:46:54,680 --> 01:46:59,160
And so, but I thought lumber yard did that get discontinued?

2418
01:46:59,160 --> 01:47:02,280
I thought lumber yard was gone.

2419
01:47:02,280 --> 01:47:03,520
I could be wrong though.

2420
01:47:03,520 --> 01:47:08,240
Um, there's so many engines out there that come and go, but I swear lumber yard I thought

2421
01:47:08,240 --> 01:47:11,000
was gone.

2422
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,840
I remember I downloaded it and then I was like, okay, I don't give a shit about this

2423
01:47:13,840 --> 01:47:17,720
anymore and never looked into it.

2424
01:47:17,720 --> 01:47:20,440
That's kind of this point, but you know, disputes happen.

2425
01:47:20,440 --> 01:47:24,000
It starts isn't coming out anytime soon though.

2426
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:27,160
Like most games, they're usually under construction for a while.

2427
01:47:27,160 --> 01:47:30,760
Quite a bit of money from all the crowdfunding, but yeah.

2428
01:47:30,760 --> 01:47:31,760
Yeah.

2429
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:32,760
Right.

2430
01:47:32,760 --> 01:47:33,760
All right.

2431
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:34,760
Well, we'll see.

2432
01:47:34,760 --> 01:47:35,760
Uh, we'll see what happens.

2433
01:47:35,760 --> 01:47:38,600
Oh, Jamie's trying to airdrop me files in the middle of the show.

2434
01:47:38,600 --> 01:47:40,480
Well, I'm going to send you the adorable.

2435
01:47:40,480 --> 01:47:41,880
And that's why I'm going to smoosh.

2436
01:47:41,880 --> 01:47:46,440
I'm going to tweet it out on the OLR account as soon as I can, but I have to read, um,

2437
01:47:46,440 --> 01:47:47,680
another story here.

2438
01:47:47,680 --> 01:47:49,040
Oh, you did.

2439
01:47:49,040 --> 01:47:50,040
Oh, good.

2440
01:47:50,040 --> 01:47:51,040
All right.

2441
01:47:51,040 --> 01:47:55,000
Let's talk about, uh, Xbox party chat.

2442
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:58,720
I remember when Xbox party chat was awesome because you could do Netflix over it, but

2443
01:47:58,720 --> 01:48:00,200
they got rid of that a while ago.

2444
01:48:00,200 --> 01:48:01,200
However, fun allowed.

2445
01:48:01,200 --> 01:48:02,440
No, no, no fun allowed.

2446
01:48:02,440 --> 01:48:06,480
Well, now you can have more fun with your phones because a new beta of the Xbox phone

2447
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:11,340
app has released and this will allow you to do party chat on your mobile device.

2448
01:48:11,340 --> 01:48:15,860
So you can chat with your Xbox party on your mobile device, which is how the Nintendo switch

2449
01:48:15,900 --> 01:48:20,100
app works, but it's still built into the console too.

2450
01:48:20,100 --> 01:48:23,220
So the Xbox app is available for both iOS and Android.

2451
01:48:23,220 --> 01:48:26,500
The new beta, however, right now is only on Google play, but for all we know, it could

2452
01:48:26,500 --> 01:48:27,900
just be going through iOS certification.

2453
01:48:27,900 --> 01:48:29,740
It might still show up there.

2454
01:48:29,740 --> 01:48:32,860
You can chat with your Xbox party even when not at a console.

2455
01:48:32,860 --> 01:48:35,740
So what's kind of cool about that is that, you know, if your, your friends are gaming

2456
01:48:35,740 --> 01:48:39,620
on Xbox, you can join the party from your mobile device and talk, you know, in the car

2457
01:48:39,620 --> 01:48:42,740
so that hands-free in the car, uh, or something like that.

2458
01:48:42,740 --> 01:48:46,020
So, uh, there's nothing official that's come out from Microsoft on this yet.

2459
01:48:46,020 --> 01:48:49,300
Uh, this is mostly because of Reddit has spotted this feature.

2460
01:48:49,300 --> 01:48:52,900
So we don't know because it's a beta, maybe they're not another thing too, which would

2461
01:48:52,900 --> 01:48:54,640
come in handy.

2462
01:48:54,640 --> 01:49:00,620
Not seeing a lot of people play the game, but you know, certain games like Minecraft,

2463
01:49:00,620 --> 01:49:03,100
um, are cross platform.

2464
01:49:03,100 --> 01:49:07,420
And so you could play from your mobile device with people that are on Xbox.

2465
01:49:07,420 --> 01:49:08,420
So you could party chat.

2466
01:49:08,420 --> 01:49:10,060
We'll play Minecraft cross platform.

2467
01:49:13,540 --> 01:49:17,300
And you can, uh, can you, I wonder if you can crash other people's games and just do

2468
01:49:17,300 --> 01:49:20,420
a go on your mobile phone device to start screaming hysterically people.

2469
01:49:20,420 --> 01:49:22,840
But I guess that's just, that's just regular Xbox live, isn't it?

2470
01:49:22,840 --> 01:49:25,700
So it's not really box live simulator.

2471
01:49:25,700 --> 01:49:26,700
Is that a game?

2472
01:49:26,700 --> 01:49:27,700
I'm sure that's a game.

2473
01:49:27,700 --> 01:49:28,700
That should be a game.

2474
01:49:28,700 --> 01:49:33,880
There has to be, that could be the safe version because you can, you know, we'll just ban

2475
01:49:33,880 --> 01:49:34,880
it off steam.

2476
01:49:34,880 --> 01:49:35,880
Don't show it to pornographic.

2477
01:49:35,880 --> 01:49:38,540
And so, you know, all right.

2478
01:49:38,540 --> 01:49:42,100
Just a few more stories for you guys before we get to our Skypline at orange lounge radio,

2479
01:49:42,100 --> 01:49:48,260
all one word on Skype, but first Jamie, Oh, I love your cat.

2480
01:49:48,260 --> 01:49:49,260
Me too.

2481
01:49:49,260 --> 01:49:53,580
That is the best little pussy ever.

2482
01:49:53,580 --> 01:49:56,340
I can't wait to crop that quote and use it out of context.

2483
01:49:56,340 --> 01:49:57,340
All right.

2484
01:49:57,340 --> 01:49:58,340
Okay.

2485
01:49:58,340 --> 01:50:04,780
Um, Autodesk, which, um, I, I kind of have a bit of a history with them cause I used

2486
01:50:04,780 --> 01:50:07,620
to use Maya a whole lot for 3d rendering.

2487
01:50:08,580 --> 01:50:16,140
But there's Stingray game development engine is being discontinued, which as far as I knew

2488
01:50:16,140 --> 01:50:22,540
there was a decent amount of development being done on it from time to time.

2489
01:50:22,540 --> 01:50:27,580
But the software is actually still going to be included with the Maya LT subscriptions

2490
01:50:27,580 --> 01:50:32,380
for the time being, but they're no longer going to be doing any development or updates

2491
01:50:32,380 --> 01:50:35,060
or sales on it down the line.

2492
01:50:35,060 --> 01:50:40,060
And this is coming right after Autodesk, uh, laid off pretty much a bunch of people.

2493
01:50:40,060 --> 01:50:41,060
So sad.

2494
01:50:41,060 --> 01:50:42,060
Yeah.

2495
01:50:42,060 --> 01:50:48,980
They laid off about 13% of their company layoffs are no fun, especially this time of year.

2496
01:50:48,980 --> 01:50:49,980
Yeah.

2497
01:50:49,980 --> 01:50:50,980
Yeah.

2498
01:50:50,980 --> 01:50:55,780
But I knew a few people who had worked on a few things in, uh, in, uh, Stingray.

2499
01:50:55,780 --> 01:51:00,120
So sometimes sometimes you want to hold onto those old engines that you know how to use,

2500
01:51:00,120 --> 01:51:02,560
you know, I know how, I know how that goes.

2501
01:51:02,560 --> 01:51:08,080
Look at us using shout cast to podcast all these years later, Twitch, what?

2502
01:51:08,080 --> 01:51:09,080
All right.

2503
01:51:09,080 --> 01:51:10,080
Uh, Loki.

2504
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:11,080
All right.

2505
01:51:11,080 --> 01:51:16,600
And so this is really random, but I guess that they're adding the predator to ghost

2506
01:51:16,600 --> 01:51:19,380
recon wild lands for a few weeks.

2507
01:51:19,380 --> 01:51:24,320
So beginning, uh, December 14th and running through the beginning of January, you can

2508
01:51:24,320 --> 01:51:31,600
play a special challenge where it's either you, um, or up to a group of four will have

2509
01:51:31,600 --> 01:51:35,880
to survive the predator.

2510
01:51:35,880 --> 01:51:36,880
That's neat.

2511
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:41,720
I guess that's kind of random, but neat.

2512
01:51:41,720 --> 01:51:45,600
I hear it's not very good, but it's a neat idea.

2513
01:51:45,600 --> 01:51:46,960
Why not put the predator in it?

2514
01:51:46,960 --> 01:51:51,120
Just, just because just put the predator in there cause you know, does your game need

2515
01:51:51,120 --> 01:51:52,120
a little boost?

2516
01:51:52,120 --> 01:51:53,120
How about the predator?

2517
01:51:53,120 --> 01:51:54,120
How about the predator?

2518
01:51:54,120 --> 01:51:55,600
Hey, it works for mortal combat.

2519
01:51:55,600 --> 01:51:56,600
That's right.

2520
01:51:56,600 --> 01:51:57,600
Why not put it in Mario Odyssey?

2521
01:51:57,600 --> 01:52:00,280
Even though I gave her really should be in all the games.

2522
01:52:00,280 --> 01:52:01,280
That's right.

2523
01:52:01,960 --> 01:52:06,000
Animal crossing predator, come on listless right now, game that needs the predator added

2524
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:07,000
to it.

2525
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:11,080
I mean, you joke, but the predator also crossed over into Archie comics, like in the nineties.

2526
01:52:11,080 --> 01:52:13,720
Like that is an actual thing that was published.

2527
01:52:13,720 --> 01:52:15,920
Will the predator show up at Riverdale then?

2528
01:52:15,920 --> 01:52:20,280
Um, probably not because Archie has crossed over with a lot of unexpected things like

2529
01:52:20,280 --> 01:52:21,280
that.

2530
01:52:21,280 --> 01:52:22,280
So probably not.

2531
01:52:22,280 --> 01:52:24,280
Is Casper the friendly ghost in Riverdale?

2532
01:52:24,280 --> 01:52:25,280
I don't watch the show.

2533
01:52:25,280 --> 01:52:26,400
I don't, I don't know.

2534
01:52:26,400 --> 01:52:27,400
Not yet.

2535
01:52:27,400 --> 01:52:29,080
Josie is, and I think they're going to add Sabrina.

2536
01:52:29,080 --> 01:52:31,040
We need Melissa Joan Hart to show up as Sabrina.

2537
01:52:31,040 --> 01:52:36,740
Well, but then I, I think they are actually doing a Sabrina show on the CW, but they're

2538
01:52:36,740 --> 01:52:37,740
doing it.

2539
01:52:37,740 --> 01:52:39,180
They're not, it's not going to be like the ABC show.

2540
01:52:39,180 --> 01:52:41,200
They're doing it that whole like dark comic style.

2541
01:52:41,200 --> 01:52:42,200
Like Riverdale is.

2542
01:52:42,200 --> 01:52:43,920
I would watch a Sabrina show like that.

2543
01:52:43,920 --> 01:52:44,920
Yeah.

2544
01:52:44,920 --> 01:52:48,280
So quick guys in our chat, uh, let's, let's do like a, we won't do a real list list, but

2545
01:52:48,280 --> 01:52:52,160
if this were a list list, what would be the game game that needs predator added to it?

2546
01:52:52,160 --> 01:52:57,320
Prey predator and prey dance, dance revolution, dance revolution.

2547
01:52:57,320 --> 01:53:00,720
You better dance faster, you son of a bitch.

2548
01:53:00,720 --> 01:53:02,040
I'm going to kill you.

2549
01:53:02,040 --> 01:53:06,400
Dua beach volleyball, dead or alive beach volleyball,

2550
01:53:06,400 --> 01:53:14,600
Silent hill, uh, super bass fishing, bass bass.

2551
01:53:14,600 --> 01:53:20,160
I don't know why I said bass bass, DDR bass, super bass.

2552
01:53:20,160 --> 01:53:24,760
Although now that we're on this tangent, super bass fishing would be hilarious where you

2553
01:53:24,760 --> 01:53:29,320
try to like catch fish using like a subwoofer and you have to have like these jalopies with

2554
01:53:29,320 --> 01:53:32,640
giant ass subwoofers, just knocking the fish out of the water.

2555
01:53:32,640 --> 01:53:33,640
That'd be hilarious.

2556
01:53:33,640 --> 01:53:36,600
When you don't catch the fish, you just hear a little boom, boom, boom, boom, but like

2557
01:53:36,600 --> 01:53:37,600
a little bass.

2558
01:53:37,600 --> 01:53:42,560
So licensing for that song from Nicki Minaj would be like, would torpedo that project.

2559
01:53:42,560 --> 01:53:43,560
Okay.

2560
01:53:43,560 --> 01:53:44,560
Some comments from chat.

2561
01:53:44,560 --> 01:53:45,560
SSU 100.

2562
01:53:45,560 --> 01:53:51,800
Matt says predator cooking mama cook, cook the right meal for them or they'll kill you.

2563
01:53:51,800 --> 01:53:52,800
That's great.

2564
01:53:52,840 --> 01:53:53,840
Dartitsia says Loki.

2565
01:53:53,840 --> 01:53:54,840
That's an amazing idea.

2566
01:53:54,840 --> 01:53:55,840
Very good.

2567
01:53:55,840 --> 01:53:56,840
I like that.

2568
01:53:56,840 --> 01:53:57,840
Predator cooking mama.

2569
01:53:57,840 --> 01:54:04,040
What if you had predator as like a skin for like, like pro hunting, like those hunting

2570
01:54:04,040 --> 01:54:07,680
games, except you could switch from the gun to being the predator.

2571
01:54:07,680 --> 01:54:12,000
Like they say like Cabela's in every Walmart in America.

2572
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:13,000
Yeah.

2573
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,760
But what if they do like a predator game like that where you go around like hunting people.

2574
01:54:15,760 --> 01:54:16,760
Okay.

2575
01:54:16,760 --> 01:54:17,760
I like that.

2576
01:54:17,760 --> 01:54:18,760
You have like little claw controllers.

2577
01:54:19,640 --> 01:54:21,360
You combine the claw game.

2578
01:54:21,360 --> 01:54:23,160
That's always right next to the Cabela game at every Walmart.

2579
01:54:23,160 --> 01:54:26,360
Not that, but you have like little hand controllers that are the claws.

2580
01:54:26,360 --> 01:54:27,360
It was my attempt at a joke.

2581
01:54:27,360 --> 01:54:28,360
All right.

2582
01:54:28,360 --> 01:54:29,360
Uh, let's see.

2583
01:54:29,360 --> 01:54:30,360
You know me.

2584
01:54:30,360 --> 01:54:31,360
I have an answer for everything.

2585
01:54:31,360 --> 01:54:34,640
Bob coffee suggests one, two, three predator fail the mini game and you die.

2586
01:54:34,640 --> 01:54:36,160
Um, let's see.

2587
01:54:36,160 --> 01:54:40,920
Vid power says predator is a robot master and mega man dungeon buster says predator

2588
01:54:40,920 --> 01:54:41,920
right?

2589
01:54:41,920 --> 01:54:42,920
Ace assassin.

2590
01:54:42,920 --> 01:54:43,920
Objection.

2591
01:54:44,920 --> 01:54:45,920
Kill you.

2592
01:54:45,920 --> 01:54:46,920
Hold it.

2593
01:54:46,920 --> 01:54:47,920
Hmm.

2594
01:54:47,920 --> 01:54:52,960
Uh, and lastly, SSG 100 Matt says predator spice world.

2595
01:54:52,960 --> 01:54:56,120
It's just the same game as spice world, but with predator heads.

2596
01:54:56,120 --> 01:55:00,720
Let's put another predator through her paces.

2597
01:55:00,720 --> 01:55:01,720
I would love it.

2598
01:55:01,720 --> 01:55:06,440
Like, it's just like you have like a game or a movie like that, but it just, they never

2599
01:55:06,440 --> 01:55:08,040
acknowledged that it's the predator.

2600
01:55:08,040 --> 01:55:13,200
It's just like another person there never acknowledging that there's a giant alien death

2601
01:55:13,200 --> 01:55:14,200
machine.

2602
01:55:14,200 --> 01:55:15,200
It's just.

2603
01:55:15,200 --> 01:55:16,200
I love it.

2604
01:55:16,200 --> 01:55:17,200
All right.

2605
01:55:17,200 --> 01:55:24,040
Well, there's only one more character that could make your game more awesome than adding

2606
01:55:24,040 --> 01:55:28,120
the predator to it and that would be adding Betty white to it.

2607
01:55:28,120 --> 01:55:29,120
That's right.

2608
01:55:29,120 --> 01:55:33,880
Let's talk about the golden girls here at the end of the show because apparently there

2609
01:55:33,880 --> 01:55:37,840
is a game that's being developed at somebody's little side project called the golden girls

2610
01:55:37,840 --> 01:55:39,720
take Manhattan DX.

2611
01:55:39,720 --> 01:55:45,000
Uh, and apparently, uh, this game is something you can read about on tumbler.

2612
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:50,840
So the creator of this game is located on tumbler at Grawley, G R A W L Y dot tumbler.com.

2613
01:55:50,840 --> 01:55:54,960
And apparently, uh, this person is a software engineer at mid boss who is the company that

2614
01:55:54,960 --> 01:55:59,680
made 2064 read only memories, which they just kind of stealth dropped on the Vita during

2615
01:55:59,680 --> 01:56:00,920
the PSX.

2616
01:56:00,920 --> 01:56:05,200
So anyway, golden girls take Manhattan is something that's been a project since January

2617
01:56:05,200 --> 01:56:10,300
2017 and basically you guys, it's golden girls meets persona.

2618
01:56:10,300 --> 01:56:11,300
That is what this is.

2619
01:56:11,300 --> 01:56:16,920
And for some reason you kill me, mr baseball and there's Kevin from home alone that Sophia

2620
01:56:16,920 --> 01:56:19,600
has to kill for, I don't know why.

2621
01:56:19,600 --> 01:56:24,520
And for some reason, um, Stanley, which is a Dorothy's ex husband is in the corner saying,

2622
01:56:24,520 --> 01:56:25,620
fuck them up girls.

2623
01:56:25,620 --> 01:56:30,440
So I, I mean, why not don't know what that is, but why not?

2624
01:56:30,440 --> 01:56:35,240
Basically this started as a silly joke, but now like it's, it's, it's a fucking like concerted

2625
01:56:35,240 --> 01:56:36,240
effort.

2626
01:56:36,240 --> 01:56:39,920
Although, I mean, if they release this, they're not going to be able to charge a dime for

2627
01:56:39,920 --> 01:56:43,880
it cause you know, they licensed the golden girls for everything now that's golden girls.

2628
01:56:43,880 --> 01:56:48,800
There's golden girls clue, golden girls, Napoli, like they, they, they fucking know that everybody

2629
01:56:48,800 --> 01:56:53,120
loves the golden girls, but you know, it only took 30 years for them to have their day.

2630
01:56:53,120 --> 01:56:56,480
Why wouldn't they license this to, you know, that's a good point.

2631
01:56:56,480 --> 01:56:58,240
That's a very good point.

2632
01:56:58,240 --> 01:56:59,240
So anyway, there you go.

2633
01:56:59,240 --> 01:57:04,480
If you like persona and you like the golden girls or shit, how can you not like both?

2634
01:57:04,480 --> 01:57:07,480
This game looks like it's something up your alley and uh, I hope it happens.

2635
01:57:07,480 --> 01:57:10,920
I hope it's able to be released in some form or another.

2636
01:57:10,920 --> 01:57:11,920
So there you go.

2637
01:57:11,920 --> 01:57:16,920
Uh, maybe, maybe Grawley will listen to this show and sneak the predator in there too.

2638
01:57:16,920 --> 01:57:20,920
Just because, just because, all right, I'm going to invite him on the show.

2639
01:57:20,920 --> 01:57:23,360
I will talk about the golden girls.

2640
01:57:23,360 --> 01:57:24,360
Okay.

2641
01:57:24,360 --> 01:57:26,920
Do you think I'm going to fucking say, if somebody comes here, I need to talk about

2642
01:57:26,920 --> 01:57:28,280
a golden girls project.

2643
01:57:28,280 --> 01:57:29,280
Come on.

2644
01:57:29,280 --> 01:57:30,880
I'm not, don't even finish the sentence.

2645
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:31,880
Golden girls.

2646
01:57:31,880 --> 01:57:32,880
You had me at golden girls.

2647
01:57:32,880 --> 01:57:34,880
You had me at St. Olaf.

2648
01:57:34,880 --> 01:57:36,640
All right.

2649
01:57:36,640 --> 01:57:37,960
We'll share some cheesecake.

2650
01:57:37,960 --> 01:57:38,960
Talk about games.

2651
01:57:38,960 --> 01:57:42,520
Uh, speaking of talking about games, you can come give us a call on Skype right now.

2652
01:57:42,520 --> 01:57:44,800
Orange lounge radio, all one word on Skype.

2653
01:57:44,800 --> 01:57:50,040
St. Olaf's row, St. Olaf's row.

2654
01:57:50,040 --> 01:57:51,040
I like that.

2655
01:57:51,040 --> 01:57:52,040
What do you do?

2656
01:57:52,040 --> 01:57:54,000
Just like run off with people's tractors?

2657
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:55,000
What wouldn't you do?

2658
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:56,000
What wouldn't you do?

2659
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:57,960
You'd kill everybody.

2660
01:57:57,960 --> 01:57:58,960
Suplex people.

2661
01:57:58,960 --> 01:58:03,720
I mean, I mean, I'm sure you could use character creator to basically make Sophia Petrello

2662
01:58:03,720 --> 01:58:05,000
in saints row.

2663
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:09,560
Well, you know, there's that wonderful game from media molecule called dream coming out.

2664
01:58:09,560 --> 01:58:11,660
And if it's your dream, that should be able to make it.

2665
01:58:11,660 --> 01:58:12,960
That is my fucking dream.

2666
01:58:12,960 --> 01:58:13,960
Actually.

2667
01:58:13,960 --> 01:58:18,080
It's like, it's like you guys were in my head just then to have the golden girls killing

2668
01:58:18,080 --> 01:58:19,080
everybody.

2669
01:58:19,080 --> 01:58:20,080
That is my dream.

2670
01:58:20,080 --> 01:58:24,280
Any last minute stories, Loki, before we get to our Skype line at orange lounge radio,

2671
01:58:24,280 --> 01:58:25,280
all one word on Skype.

2672
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:26,280
That's Loki.

2673
01:58:26,280 --> 01:58:27,280
That has last minute.

2674
01:58:27,280 --> 01:58:28,280
Do you have last minute stories?

2675
01:58:28,280 --> 01:58:29,280
No.

2676
01:58:29,280 --> 01:58:30,280
Cause you never do.

2677
01:58:30,280 --> 01:58:31,280
That's why I did last week.

2678
01:58:31,280 --> 01:58:33,760
The Animal Crossing garden was me.

2679
01:58:33,760 --> 01:58:34,760
And look, we have them today.

2680
01:58:34,760 --> 01:58:36,540
JD, do you have any last minute stories?

2681
01:58:36,540 --> 01:58:37,540
I don't.

2682
01:58:37,540 --> 01:58:38,540
All right.

2683
01:58:38,540 --> 01:58:47,500
Now that I've considered everybody, Loki, I don't have anything last minute, unfortunately.

2684
01:58:47,500 --> 01:58:49,000
It's been a pretty slow week.

2685
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,140
A little bit, a little bit.

2686
01:58:51,140 --> 01:58:54,800
I was expecting this, this week's show to have like no news.

2687
01:58:54,800 --> 01:58:58,260
And at least there's like a little bit, but no news.

2688
01:58:58,260 --> 01:58:59,520
No good news is good.

2689
01:58:59,520 --> 01:59:05,160
Good news with Gary gnu and we are, we like the only people who remember the great space

2690
01:59:05,160 --> 01:59:06,160
coaster.

2691
01:59:06,160 --> 01:59:07,160
Yes.

2692
01:59:07,160 --> 01:59:08,160
All right.

2693
01:59:08,160 --> 01:59:09,160
Let's go do the phones.

2694
01:59:09,160 --> 01:59:10,160
Hi.

2695
01:59:10,160 --> 01:59:11,160
You're on orange launch radio.

2696
01:59:11,160 --> 01:59:12,160
Who's this?

2697
01:59:12,160 --> 01:59:13,160
Hey, uh, this is raging leader.

2698
01:59:13,160 --> 01:59:14,160
An email and a phone call tonight.

2699
01:59:14,160 --> 01:59:15,160
Well, what's on your mind, buddy?

2700
01:59:15,160 --> 01:59:16,160
Yeah.

2701
01:59:16,160 --> 01:59:19,840
Well, I honestly didn't seriously think I would be able to listen in, uh, tonight, you

2702
01:59:19,840 --> 01:59:22,400
know, live and be in China and all that.

2703
01:59:22,400 --> 01:59:23,400
Glad you made it.

2704
01:59:23,400 --> 01:59:24,400
Yeah.

2705
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:29,120
Like I said, you said in the email, I've been having computer problems that I kind of sorry

2706
01:59:29,120 --> 01:59:30,800
got my computer to work.

2707
01:59:30,800 --> 01:59:31,800
I'll be in barely.

2708
01:59:31,800 --> 01:59:35,680
It's kind of like essentially the computer version of a coma right now.

2709
01:59:35,680 --> 01:59:43,280
So yeah, but uh, anyway, uh, I have a question for you.

2710
01:59:43,280 --> 01:59:51,140
It's not sort of, you know, not really gaming really, but it's kind of like tangential holidays.

2711
01:59:51,140 --> 01:59:52,140
What the hell?

2712
01:59:52,140 --> 01:59:53,140
What is it?

2713
01:59:53,180 --> 01:59:54,180
All right.

2714
01:59:54,180 --> 02:00:03,020
Well, no, uh, uh, I, you know, well, it helps if I put something in chat, uh, a link, cause

2715
02:00:03,020 --> 02:00:10,500
I'll be referencing, uh, the, the link you may want to bring it up, uh, up in your personal

2716
02:00:10,500 --> 02:00:11,500
web browsers.

2717
02:00:11,500 --> 02:00:12,500
All right.

2718
02:00:12,500 --> 02:00:14,860
So for the podcast listeners, um, because the podcast listeners aren't going to see

2719
02:00:14,860 --> 02:00:19,640
the link, I'm getting a link at new egg for a gaming, it looks like a gaming PC that's

2720
02:00:19,640 --> 02:00:20,640
out of stock right now.

2721
02:00:20,640 --> 02:00:21,640
Yeah.

2722
02:00:21,640 --> 02:00:22,640
Yeah.

2723
02:00:22,640 --> 02:00:23,640
I have a computer.

2724
02:00:23,640 --> 02:00:33,640
I have now my computer has, uh, in, in, in, in Nvidia G force GT six, 10, um, and right

2725
02:00:33,640 --> 02:00:39,640
now basically that dunk, uh, the vehicle is more or less pretty much dad for the most

2726
02:00:39,640 --> 02:00:40,640
part.

2727
02:00:40,640 --> 02:00:47,780
Um, now, you know, now to be completely honest, I have everyone within the VOD community.

2728
02:00:47,780 --> 02:00:51,560
I'm probably the least tech savvy out of everyone here.

2729
02:00:51,560 --> 02:00:59,860
Um, now that, you know, I, I just barely managed to put new, a new, uh, ram it to my computer

2730
02:00:59,860 --> 02:01:03,520
when I first got it, you know how I figured that out is beyond me.

2731
02:01:03,520 --> 02:01:10,960
But that being said, you know, if you were in my shoes, which, uh, would you, you know,

2732
02:01:10,960 --> 02:01:18,420
if you were to buy a new video card, you know, virtually next to nothing about switching

2733
02:01:18,420 --> 02:01:23,380
out parts about that, would you get the exact same card that you currently have in your

2734
02:01:23,380 --> 02:01:30,620
computer knowing that, Hey, it'll be compatible and it'll fit within your case or would you

2735
02:01:30,620 --> 02:01:39,980
take a slight gamble, maybe a slight upgrade, uh, and maybe it'll work, maybe it won't work.

2736
02:01:39,980 --> 02:01:42,200
Um, that's a good question.

2737
02:01:42,200 --> 02:01:44,440
Uh, this is, here's the thing though.

2738
02:01:44,440 --> 02:01:45,440
Here's the challenge.

2739
02:01:45,440 --> 02:01:50,000
This is why usually you want to kind of stay away from the all in one box computers anyway,

2740
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:51,000
but I get it.

2741
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,820
Like sometimes that's the cost affordability option.

2742
02:01:53,820 --> 02:01:58,160
And I think that's also a big, big factor in what you're talking about is I know you

2743
02:01:58,160 --> 02:02:02,440
might have registered your email too, is that, you know, you have cost things to, to consider

2744
02:02:02,440 --> 02:02:03,440
as well.

2745
02:02:03,440 --> 02:02:07,760
So I think with that being said, you probably just want to stick with what you have, um,

2746
02:02:07,760 --> 02:02:12,300
until you can kind of save up maybe to build a computer that's, you know, got a little

2747
02:02:12,300 --> 02:02:13,660
more beef in it.

2748
02:02:13,660 --> 02:02:17,060
But um, this computer doesn't exactly sound like it's a slouch though.

2749
02:02:17,060 --> 02:02:19,860
I mean, it should be able to handle a stronger video card.

2750
02:02:19,860 --> 02:02:20,860
Um,

2751
02:02:20,860 --> 02:02:21,860
Yeah.

2752
02:02:21,860 --> 02:02:22,860
Yeah.

2753
02:02:22,860 --> 02:02:23,860
Yeah.

2754
02:02:23,860 --> 02:02:24,860
No, no, no.

2755
02:02:24,860 --> 02:02:31,200
The fact that I've been having issues with the card aside, you know, even granted, like

2756
02:02:31,200 --> 02:02:38,100
you said, you know, this card that I currently have is relatively old is for, in as far as

2757
02:02:38,100 --> 02:02:45,260
video cards go, you know, it, you know, I've been, you know, I've been able to run games

2758
02:02:45,260 --> 02:02:47,860
pre, uh, pretty easily for the most part.

2759
02:02:47,860 --> 02:02:54,640
Uh, the only thing, you know, game that I've had problems with running is, uh, the free

2760
02:02:54,640 --> 02:03:01,660
version of, uh, Killer Instinct, which was released on, uh, Windows and Xbox One.

2761
02:03:01,660 --> 02:03:07,980
There, there is a little bit of a frame rate issue with that, but aside from that, yeah,

2762
02:03:07,980 --> 02:03:08,980
it's been working well.

2763
02:03:08,980 --> 02:03:09,980
So, um,

2764
02:03:09,980 --> 02:03:10,980
Okay.

2765
02:03:10,980 --> 02:03:12,980
Um, well, our chatters are helping out a little bit here and they know a lot more, especially

2766
02:03:12,980 --> 02:03:13,980
than I do.

2767
02:03:13,980 --> 02:03:18,660
So Rama is jumping in saying, uh, video card should match the chip set for better performance

2768
02:03:18,660 --> 02:03:23,320
if it's AMD or Nvidia, but granted nowadays that's a moot point, but it's something I

2769
02:03:23,320 --> 02:03:24,500
always go by.

2770
02:03:24,500 --> 02:03:26,860
S3100Matt has a great website.

2771
02:03:26,860 --> 02:03:29,540
Um, I don't know this site, but I, I take his word for it.

2772
02:03:29,540 --> 02:03:34,760
Um, S3100Matt suggests a website called pc-specs.com.

2773
02:03:34,760 --> 02:03:38,140
If you use that site, it's going to tell you what components are compatible with your computer.

2774
02:03:38,140 --> 02:03:39,260
That's a great idea.

2775
02:03:39,260 --> 02:03:44,020
I would say, yeah, if you got like a thing you can kind of test like that, that is, uh,

2776
02:03:44,020 --> 02:03:45,020
probably going to be great.

2777
02:03:45,020 --> 02:03:46,020
So, um,

2778
02:03:46,020 --> 02:03:47,020
All right.

2779
02:03:47,020 --> 02:03:48,020
Yeah.

2780
02:03:48,020 --> 02:03:49,020
Give it a try.

2781
02:03:49,020 --> 02:03:53,220
I do have one final question, uh, regarding video cards and I'll free up the lines for

2782
02:03:53,220 --> 02:03:54,640
other people to call.

2783
02:03:54,640 --> 02:04:04,600
I, I know at least with, uh, Nvidia, Nvidia graphics cards, no, no, w multiple companies

2784
02:04:04,600 --> 02:04:15,080
now make, uh, make the cards and there's slight variations, uh, there in, um, now if I were

2785
02:04:15,080 --> 02:04:20,340
to get like, uh, you know, uh, it's, you know, if I were to buy, you know, one of those,

2786
02:04:20,340 --> 02:04:28,820
uh, GT, uh, in G force GT six tens, do I really have to make sure I get a specific, you know,

2787
02:04:28,820 --> 02:04:34,740
one from a specific company or can I get any more salt and so long as it's a G force, I

2788
02:04:34,740 --> 02:04:37,140
don't think you need to, they're really all the same.

2789
02:04:37,140 --> 02:04:42,020
I mean, the only difference between those usually is just how fast the chips are clocked

2790
02:04:42,020 --> 02:04:44,900
and maybe what kind of, how much Rams in there.

2791
02:04:44,900 --> 02:04:48,880
But all that, I mean, there really is not going to be much of a difference between any

2792
02:04:48,880 --> 02:04:49,880
of them.

2793
02:04:49,880 --> 02:04:50,880
Just buy the cheapest one.

2794
02:04:50,880 --> 02:04:51,880
You can find.

2795
02:04:51,880 --> 02:04:52,880
Oh, all right.

2796
02:04:52,880 --> 02:04:53,880
All right.

2797
02:04:53,880 --> 02:04:56,800
This, this is going to end our call for help with Leo, the Roberts right now.

2798
02:04:56,800 --> 02:04:58,880
So thank you very much for the call.

2799
02:04:58,880 --> 02:04:59,880
Take care.

2800
02:04:59,880 --> 02:05:00,880
Yep.

2801
02:05:00,880 --> 02:05:01,880
Take care.

2802
02:05:01,880 --> 02:05:02,880
Yep.

2803
02:05:02,880 --> 02:05:03,880
All right.

2804
02:05:03,880 --> 02:05:04,880
Orange lounge radio, all one word on Skype.

2805
02:05:04,880 --> 02:05:08,420
If you'd like to give us a call, uh, or if not, I guess we can just get back to talking

2806
02:05:08,420 --> 02:05:09,420
amongst ourselves.

2807
02:05:09,420 --> 02:05:12,920
I think you have another, it turns out I do actually have a late breaking story.

2808
02:05:12,940 --> 02:05:14,340
Well, how about that?

2809
02:05:14,340 --> 02:05:20,340
Um, so team Ninja has announced to stop developing the dead or alive series on their live stream.

2810
02:05:20,340 --> 02:05:22,680
Wait, there's, they're no longer developing it.

2811
02:05:22,680 --> 02:05:24,540
That is what this Twitter post says.

2812
02:05:24,540 --> 02:05:25,540
Wow.

2813
02:05:25,540 --> 02:05:26,540
Yep.

2814
02:05:26,540 --> 02:05:28,140
So I guess that's no more volleyball.

2815
02:05:28,140 --> 02:05:29,140
Rest in peace.

2816
02:05:29,140 --> 02:05:30,140
That's wow.

2817
02:05:30,140 --> 02:05:31,600
I want to know more about what ended it.

2818
02:05:31,600 --> 02:05:32,600
What went into that?

2819
02:05:32,600 --> 02:05:33,940
Are they just making something else?

2820
02:05:33,940 --> 02:05:36,380
I mean, team Ninja isn't folding, right?

2821
02:05:36,380 --> 02:05:40,160
So it sounds like they're just going for other directions, but I didn't watch the live stream.

2822
02:05:40,160 --> 02:05:42,100
I only saw one Twitter post about it.

2823
02:05:42,100 --> 02:05:43,100
Interesting.

2824
02:05:43,100 --> 02:05:44,100
Let's get to the phones.

2825
02:05:44,100 --> 02:05:45,100
Hi.

2826
02:05:45,100 --> 02:05:46,100
You're on Orange lounge radio.

2827
02:05:46,100 --> 02:05:47,100
Who's this?

2828
02:05:47,100 --> 02:05:48,100
Hey, what's going on everyone?

2829
02:05:48,100 --> 02:05:49,100
It's Ronbo.

2830
02:05:49,100 --> 02:05:50,100
Uh, what's up buddy?

2831
02:05:50,100 --> 02:05:51,100
Not much.

2832
02:05:51,100 --> 02:05:56,260
I just finished watching one of my favorite holiday movies as a glorified musical.

2833
02:05:56,260 --> 02:06:01,180
So I have a question for everybody in the studio.

2834
02:06:01,180 --> 02:06:02,180
Okay.

2835
02:06:02,180 --> 02:06:09,320
What recent video game that you have played that you will love to see as a Broadway musical

2836
02:06:09,320 --> 02:06:15,960
that is so tacky, so bad, but it'll still be a guilty pleasure for you to watch any

2837
02:06:15,960 --> 02:06:18,800
time of the year?

2838
02:06:18,800 --> 02:06:22,720
Uh, a video game that should be a tacky Broadway musical.

2839
02:06:22,720 --> 02:06:27,560
Literally every game I play, literally every game you play Splatoon is, Oh my God, I split

2840
02:06:27,560 --> 02:06:28,920
hand to imagine actually.

2841
02:06:28,920 --> 02:06:29,920
Yeah.

2842
02:06:29,920 --> 02:06:31,640
That would be actually kind of fun, especially with that kind of music.

2843
02:06:31,640 --> 02:06:36,240
Like the like ska music, the musical style, plus just how much character like the narrators

2844
02:06:36,240 --> 02:06:37,240
have.

2845
02:06:38,240 --> 02:06:39,240
Callie, Marie, Marina.

2846
02:06:39,240 --> 02:06:40,240
Marina.

2847
02:06:40,240 --> 02:06:41,240
Yeah.

2848
02:06:41,240 --> 02:06:42,240
Why not?

2849
02:06:42,240 --> 02:06:43,240
That would be fun.

2850
02:06:43,240 --> 02:06:44,240
Two.

2851
02:06:44,240 --> 02:06:45,240
Okay.

2852
02:06:45,240 --> 02:06:46,240
One's not out yet.

2853
02:06:46,240 --> 02:06:47,240
So I'm gonna start with the one that is out.

2854
02:06:47,240 --> 02:06:48,240
No more heroes.

2855
02:06:48,240 --> 02:06:49,240
Okay.

2856
02:06:49,240 --> 02:06:50,240
Would be fucking balls.

2857
02:06:50,240 --> 02:06:51,240
Crazy.

2858
02:06:51,240 --> 02:06:55,840
And then the one that's going to top that of course obviously is going to be Death Stranding

2859
02:06:55,840 --> 02:07:02,200
because what the fuck would that be as a musical?

2860
02:07:02,200 --> 02:07:07,320
My two answers would be Super Mario Odyssey because you know, the one with the Pauline

2861
02:07:07,320 --> 02:07:09,800
singing and stuff would be fun, a little jazz there.

2862
02:07:09,800 --> 02:07:13,160
And then my other answer, which I thought like he was going to steal this would be Saints

2863
02:07:13,160 --> 02:07:14,160
Row.

2864
02:07:14,160 --> 02:07:15,160
Hello.

2865
02:07:15,160 --> 02:07:16,160
I'll be a hilarious musical.

2866
02:07:16,160 --> 02:07:18,480
They've done a Saints Row musical actually.

2867
02:07:18,480 --> 02:07:19,480
They're in Saints Row.

2868
02:07:19,480 --> 02:07:21,400
Then the script is already fucking done.

2869
02:07:21,400 --> 02:07:24,400
I think the one I would have picked would probably be Phoenix Wright, Ace Attorney.

2870
02:07:24,400 --> 02:07:28,280
How about you Dar Sakura video game that should be a Broadway musical?

2871
02:07:28,280 --> 02:07:30,880
I would say Breath of the Wild, but that's too easy.

2872
02:07:30,880 --> 02:07:34,980
So I'm going to pick Animal Crossing.

2873
02:07:34,980 --> 02:07:39,160
But it has to be all in that language.

2874
02:07:39,160 --> 02:07:45,920
I've brought you a fish, thanks for 500 bells.

2875
02:07:45,920 --> 02:07:50,000
How about a Broadway musical based on the Sims, but it's in Simlish.

2876
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:51,000
No, no, no.

2877
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:54,880
It has to be Animal Crossing because the Sims have already done like the redoing the songs.

2878
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:57,400
I can't wait for the Rossetti song in that one.

2879
02:07:57,920 --> 02:08:00,680
But it'd be like, I need a new catchphrase.

2880
02:08:00,680 --> 02:08:01,680
Okay.

2881
02:08:01,680 --> 02:08:02,680
It's ass munch.

2882
02:08:02,680 --> 02:08:04,680
Thank you ass munch.

2883
02:08:04,680 --> 02:08:07,000
Rossetti would start after the intermission.

2884
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:09,800
I think that's what should happen is that at the end of part A, the curtain just drops

2885
02:08:09,800 --> 02:08:14,880
and the Rossetti shows up after the intermission to give a long lecture about you lazy assholes

2886
02:08:14,880 --> 02:08:18,200
when you come to the theater, you should be able to sit through the whole performance

2887
02:08:18,200 --> 02:08:21,800
and you shouldn't just stop things in the middle of it so you can get a diet soda.

2888
02:08:21,800 --> 02:08:25,520
Don't you know the diet soda is bad for you and just go on and on like Rossetti does.

2889
02:08:25,520 --> 02:08:26,880
We need to start workshopping this.

2890
02:08:26,880 --> 02:08:27,880
Right.

2891
02:08:27,880 --> 02:08:28,880
That's right.

2892
02:08:28,880 --> 02:08:29,880
There you go.

2893
02:08:29,880 --> 02:08:30,880
And then we'll have Lyle trying to sell you insurance on your way out.

2894
02:08:30,880 --> 02:08:36,040
So look forward to Animal Crossing the musical and basically everyone at the concession

2895
02:08:36,040 --> 02:08:38,080
stand has to wear nookling masks.

2896
02:08:38,080 --> 02:08:43,880
And I think the whole thing has to be who fucking dug the pitfall in front of Barbara's

2897
02:08:43,880 --> 02:08:44,880
house.

2898
02:08:44,880 --> 02:08:45,880
Rob.

2899
02:08:45,880 --> 02:08:49,880
Who hit Ed with the shovel?

2900
02:08:49,880 --> 02:08:54,880
Well, I didn't have a bug net yet, so I hit him with shovel.

2901
02:08:54,880 --> 02:08:55,880
Oops.

2902
02:08:56,880 --> 02:08:58,600
Anyone want some glue?

2903
02:08:58,600 --> 02:09:00,480
How about some chat answers?

2904
02:09:00,480 --> 02:09:03,280
VidPower suggests Danganronpa the musical.

2905
02:09:03,280 --> 02:09:05,280
Oh my God.

2906
02:09:05,280 --> 02:09:08,480
Bob Coffee says Metal Gear Solid the musical.

2907
02:09:08,480 --> 02:09:11,520
It's just a cardboard box moving slowly down the stage.

2908
02:09:11,520 --> 02:09:13,680
Tigerclaw says Mega Man the musical.

2909
02:09:13,680 --> 02:09:14,680
Too many characters.

2910
02:09:14,680 --> 02:09:20,480
Come on, Kylie Minomis says how about a Stardew Valley musical?

2911
02:09:20,480 --> 02:09:21,480
That's a pretty good one.

2912
02:09:21,480 --> 02:09:22,480
I like that.

2913
02:09:22,480 --> 02:09:25,800
Tigerclaw says just how about World of Warcraft is a musical.

2914
02:09:26,720 --> 02:09:31,520
SSG100Matt says President Cat the musical would make more money than the game did.

2915
02:09:31,520 --> 02:09:33,200
And Undertale the musical.

2916
02:09:33,200 --> 02:09:34,200
Of course.

2917
02:09:34,200 --> 02:09:35,200
Oh God.

2918
02:09:35,200 --> 02:09:37,880
There'd already be a built-in Tumblr base to go see that.

2919
02:09:37,880 --> 02:09:41,300
By the way, Fifth Dream is following up on what you were talking about with the Dead

2920
02:09:41,300 --> 02:09:42,300
or Alive thing.

2921
02:09:42,300 --> 02:09:43,300
Just quickly here.

2922
02:09:43,300 --> 02:09:47,280
The developer explained Dead or Alive 5 has finally come to an end, but the Dead or Alive

2923
02:09:47,280 --> 02:09:49,320
team is very active.

2924
02:09:49,320 --> 02:09:52,560
It's time to stop what we're doing for now and look into the future.

2925
02:09:52,560 --> 02:09:55,520
So that doesn't really rule out Dead or Alive 6.

2926
02:09:55,520 --> 02:10:00,040
That just means no more costumes, which actually, did you see some of the dude costumes in Dead

2927
02:10:00,040 --> 02:10:01,040
or Alive 5?

2928
02:10:01,040 --> 02:10:02,160
No, but we'll trade images later.

2929
02:10:02,160 --> 02:10:03,160
Please go look them up.

2930
02:10:03,160 --> 02:10:04,160
Thank you.

2931
02:10:04,160 --> 02:10:05,160
Alright.

2932
02:10:05,160 --> 02:10:07,080
That definitely, well that's what happens when you use Twitter as a news source.

2933
02:10:07,080 --> 02:10:09,500
Well Rama, Imma flip it on ya.

2934
02:10:09,500 --> 02:10:12,640
What would be your video game musical?

2935
02:10:12,640 --> 02:10:13,640
Overwatch.

2936
02:10:13,640 --> 02:10:14,640
Overwatch.

2937
02:10:14,640 --> 02:10:15,640
That's a good one.

2938
02:10:15,640 --> 02:10:16,640
Oh, that's right.

2939
02:10:16,640 --> 02:10:18,600
There was a Saints Row musical.

2940
02:10:18,600 --> 02:10:20,460
Buggy Saints Row.

2941
02:10:20,460 --> 02:10:21,720
That's fucking amazing.

2942
02:10:21,720 --> 02:10:24,440
And yes, I would love Buggy Saints Row as a musical.

2943
02:10:24,440 --> 02:10:25,440
Go look it up.

2944
02:10:25,440 --> 02:10:26,680
I'll link it in chat.

2945
02:10:26,680 --> 02:10:27,680
There was.

2946
02:10:27,680 --> 02:10:33,520
I remember back in the all games days at one of those E3s that was at the big arena thing

2947
02:10:33,520 --> 02:10:37,380
in Santa Monica, they had a Mario Brothers Opera.

2948
02:10:37,380 --> 02:10:40,840
So somebody's kind of tried it.

2949
02:10:40,840 --> 02:10:41,840
For what it's worth.

2950
02:10:41,840 --> 02:10:42,840
I will point out.

2951
02:10:42,840 --> 02:10:43,840
Oh, sorry.

2952
02:10:43,840 --> 02:10:44,840
Oh yeah.

2953
02:10:44,840 --> 02:10:49,480
As Joe points out, the indie game Dominique Pamplemousse was the musical game.

2954
02:10:49,480 --> 02:10:50,480
That's right.

2955
02:10:50,480 --> 02:10:51,920
They're what, that was a musical.

2956
02:10:51,920 --> 02:10:54,600
It was a, it was also, it's a musical game.

2957
02:10:54,600 --> 02:10:55,600
And it was stop motion.

2958
02:10:55,600 --> 02:10:56,600
Yeah.

2959
02:10:56,600 --> 02:10:57,600
That was a pretty, that's a fun one.

2960
02:10:57,600 --> 02:10:59,760
I'm looking at some of these costumes and they're pretty crazy.

2961
02:10:59,760 --> 02:11:00,760
Good times.

2962
02:11:00,760 --> 02:11:01,760
All right, Rama.

2963
02:11:01,760 --> 02:11:02,760
Well, that was a fun question.

2964
02:11:02,760 --> 02:11:03,760
How was the Christmas story musical?

2965
02:11:03,760 --> 02:11:07,680
Should I bother watching it or?

2966
02:11:07,680 --> 02:11:13,160
The best way I can find it is it's Street Fighter bad, but good.

2967
02:11:13,160 --> 02:11:14,640
Street Fighter bad, but good.

2968
02:11:14,640 --> 02:11:15,640
Okay.

2969
02:11:15,640 --> 02:11:16,640
That's like, but now.

2970
02:11:16,640 --> 02:11:17,640
I enjoyed it.

2971
02:11:17,640 --> 02:11:18,640
You understood.

2972
02:11:18,640 --> 02:11:21,320
You understood they were not remaking the movie, right?

2973
02:11:21,320 --> 02:11:22,640
At first.

2974
02:11:22,640 --> 02:11:26,600
But then I was watching it and I totally forgot that there wasn't Broadway musical that I

2975
02:11:26,600 --> 02:11:31,620
wanted to see so badly, but Joe's got to be in consideration that I'm a little biased.

2976
02:11:31,620 --> 02:11:37,480
You're talking to somebody who sits here and watches the Christmas story marathon, at least

2977
02:11:37,480 --> 02:11:44,120
parts of it when they brought it for 24 hours, I have the 30th anniversary DVD on my shelf

2978
02:11:44,120 --> 02:11:45,760
that I watch every year.

2979
02:11:45,760 --> 02:11:50,600
I have a Blu-ray of the movie somewhere in my shelf that I watch.

2980
02:11:50,600 --> 02:11:57,840
I also have the terror really bad on Christmas story two Blu-ray that I also watch.

2981
02:11:57,840 --> 02:12:00,560
You have to understand, this is my guilty pleasure film.

2982
02:12:00,560 --> 02:12:05,040
Now do you know one of the next musicals that Fox is going to be doing?

2983
02:12:05,040 --> 02:12:08,680
I don't know if they advertised it, but do you know what is scheduled to air in January

2984
02:12:08,680 --> 02:12:12,520
of 2019?

2985
02:12:12,520 --> 02:12:14,520
Do you know what they're doing?

2986
02:12:14,520 --> 02:12:15,520
No.

2987
02:12:15,520 --> 02:12:16,520
Rent.

2988
02:12:16,520 --> 02:12:18,980
Oh my God.

2989
02:12:18,980 --> 02:12:21,220
This will not end well.

2990
02:12:21,220 --> 02:12:22,820
Yep.

2991
02:12:22,820 --> 02:12:24,660
So just look forward to that.

2992
02:12:24,660 --> 02:12:29,780
Fox brings you the studio that brought you A Christmas Story Live and the Rocky Horror

2993
02:12:29,780 --> 02:12:33,860
Picture Show, which was really the Rocky Horror Show, and they would have had a lot more people

2994
02:12:33,860 --> 02:12:37,220
on board if they just had said it was the Rocky Horror Show on television.

2995
02:12:37,220 --> 02:12:41,580
If they'd done that, it will be bringing you Rent Live in 2019, I'm sure many people are

2996
02:12:41,580 --> 02:12:42,580
thrilled to hear that.

2997
02:12:42,580 --> 02:12:46,700
They just need to have the Rocky Horror Show, but as an actual serial show, like The Muppet

2998
02:12:46,700 --> 02:12:47,700
Show.

2999
02:12:47,700 --> 02:12:54,820
It's the Dr. Frank converter show.

3000
02:12:54,820 --> 02:12:59,520
You should open one of the times you're hosting Rocky like that.

3001
02:12:59,520 --> 02:13:00,520
In a full Kermit thing.

3002
02:13:00,520 --> 02:13:03,760
Yeah, there's a whole Muppet Show parody, that'd be hilarious.

3003
02:13:03,760 --> 02:13:05,560
You know what?

3004
02:13:05,560 --> 02:13:07,380
The word time set something off for me.

3005
02:13:07,380 --> 02:13:08,380
Our time capsule.

3006
02:13:08,380 --> 02:13:09,600
We'll do it the first show, you're back.

3007
02:13:09,600 --> 02:13:12,660
If you're here for the New Year's thing, we'll do it then, if not, we'll do it the next show.

3008
02:13:12,660 --> 02:13:13,660
Okay.

3009
02:13:13,660 --> 02:13:14,660
Yeah.

3010
02:13:14,660 --> 02:13:15,660
I don't want to do it tonight.

3011
02:13:15,660 --> 02:13:16,660
Year's not over yet.

3012
02:13:16,660 --> 02:13:17,660
Fine.

3013
02:13:17,660 --> 02:13:20,420
She wants to open Christmas presents early and we can't do that.

3014
02:13:20,420 --> 02:13:21,420
All right.

3015
02:13:21,420 --> 02:13:27,220
So speaking of Mega Man, we still can't do it for the people that wanted a Mega Man musical.

3016
02:13:27,220 --> 02:13:32,580
If you look on YouTube, there's this guy who's done like lyrics to music to like, oh yeah,

3017
02:13:32,580 --> 02:13:34,920
there's one of us listen to every mega ran out.

3018
02:13:34,920 --> 02:13:38,860
So I mean, it doesn't exactly exist in musical form, but like that's a taste of it.

3019
02:13:38,860 --> 02:13:39,860
There you go.

3020
02:13:39,860 --> 02:13:43,400
I've done a lot of rental plus stuff for fortune cookie.

3021
02:13:43,400 --> 02:13:44,400
A lot.

3022
02:13:44,400 --> 02:13:45,400
She's done a lot.

3023
02:13:45,400 --> 02:13:46,400
All right.

3024
02:13:46,440 --> 02:13:47,440
I'll let you go, buddy.

3025
02:13:47,440 --> 02:13:48,440
But thanks for the call.

3026
02:13:48,440 --> 02:13:49,440
Uh, Rob.

3027
02:13:49,440 --> 02:13:50,440
What?

3028
02:13:50,440 --> 02:13:55,280
I just want you to know, you have said some really funny outlandish things to me and I

3029
02:13:55,280 --> 02:14:00,240
just bounced it back to you and we go back and forth, but after what you just said about

3030
02:14:00,240 --> 02:14:08,760
Fox doing rent, I'm just sitting here with my hands clasped, my face sitting on my, on

3031
02:14:08,760 --> 02:14:14,800
my clasped hands, just staring at my desk like Gendo Akari, I'm just like, okay, this

3032
02:14:14,800 --> 02:14:18,480
is what the gays call clutching your pearls.

3033
02:14:18,480 --> 02:14:21,160
I wouldn't call this clutching your pearls.

3034
02:14:21,160 --> 02:14:25,480
It's like, I'm thinking when this happens, we should go down to the studios and just

3035
02:14:25,480 --> 02:14:30,640
be there just in case if we have to clean house.

3036
02:14:30,640 --> 02:14:32,520
Or I'm just not going to turn the TV on.

3037
02:14:32,520 --> 02:14:37,400
It'll probably be on a Sunday night when OLR's going and let's be real like this show ain't

3038
02:14:37,400 --> 02:14:42,880
going to stop till Comcast blocks our internet thanks to net neutrality getting fucked.

3039
02:14:42,880 --> 02:14:44,840
So there it is.

3040
02:14:44,840 --> 02:14:46,920
I'll send you some of my Verizon fiber.

3041
02:14:46,920 --> 02:14:48,640
I'll put some, I'll put some support out.

3042
02:14:48,640 --> 02:14:49,640
All right.

3043
02:14:49,640 --> 02:14:50,640
Take care of my friend.

3044
02:14:50,640 --> 02:14:51,640
Thanks for the call.

3045
02:14:51,640 --> 02:14:52,640
Enjoy.

3046
02:14:52,640 --> 02:14:53,640
Bye.

3047
02:14:53,640 --> 02:14:57,040
Uh, Orange Launch Radio, all one word on Skype if anyone else wants to sneak through.

3048
02:14:57,040 --> 02:15:01,360
Meanwhile, anybody else in the studio have a tidbit, something for us to talk about?

3049
02:15:01,360 --> 02:15:02,360
No.

3050
02:15:02,360 --> 02:15:03,360
No?

3051
02:15:03,360 --> 02:15:04,360
Dying down there.

3052
02:15:04,360 --> 02:15:05,360
Let's see.

3053
02:15:05,360 --> 02:15:06,760
I'm looking at chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

3054
02:15:06,760 --> 02:15:08,440
Uh, let's see.

3055
02:15:08,640 --> 02:15:12,960
Brad from Pod Culture has some strong feelings saying a Christmas story is the fucking worst

3056
02:15:12,960 --> 02:15:14,680
movie ever.

3057
02:15:14,680 --> 02:15:16,760
I worked Suncoast during the holidays.

3058
02:15:16,760 --> 02:15:19,040
That goddamn DVD was always in.

3059
02:15:19,040 --> 02:15:20,700
It needs to die.

3060
02:15:20,700 --> 02:15:23,000
There are people that feel strongly about a Christmas story.

3061
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:28,080
I think I remember that movie growing up, like we used to, when I was growing up, we

3062
02:15:28,080 --> 02:15:32,440
would watch that movie like on Christmas Eve, like all the time.

3063
02:15:32,440 --> 02:15:39,920
But the problem was when everybody who was seven became 30, then it was like, now you

3064
02:15:39,920 --> 02:15:41,520
fucking can't get away from it.

3065
02:15:41,520 --> 02:15:42,520
It's everywhere.

3066
02:15:42,520 --> 02:15:46,240
So I see why people get a little bit like jaded about it.

3067
02:15:46,240 --> 02:15:50,040
But for, especially for the time, it was, it was funny.

3068
02:15:50,040 --> 02:15:51,040
It's a good movie.

3069
02:15:51,040 --> 02:15:52,320
I actually don't know if I know it.

3070
02:15:52,320 --> 02:15:53,320
A Christmas story.

3071
02:15:53,320 --> 02:15:54,320
Do you know?

3072
02:15:54,320 --> 02:15:55,320
You'll shoot your eye out.

3073
02:15:55,320 --> 02:15:56,320
Do you know that line?

3074
02:15:56,320 --> 02:15:57,320
Okay.

3075
02:15:57,320 --> 02:15:58,320
He's hesitating.

3076
02:15:58,320 --> 02:15:59,320
So that means he's never seen it.

3077
02:15:59,320 --> 02:16:00,320
I hate that movie, by the way.

3078
02:16:00,320 --> 02:16:01,320
So you're with Brad from Pod Culture.

3079
02:16:01,320 --> 02:16:02,320
It just really bugs me.

3080
02:16:03,200 --> 02:16:05,520
It's just not fun to watch.

3081
02:16:05,520 --> 02:16:08,000
Is it because they did too much of it?

3082
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:09,800
Like it got, cause you know, they're okay.

3083
02:16:09,800 --> 02:16:10,800
Let me put it this way.

3084
02:16:10,800 --> 02:16:14,400
There's some people that don't like Star Wars, you know, which people are so wrong.

3085
02:16:14,400 --> 02:16:19,440
Marathon Star Wars for a full day, like on a certain channel every year.

3086
02:16:19,440 --> 02:16:20,440
Are you sure?

3087
02:16:20,440 --> 02:16:21,440
All right.

3088
02:16:21,440 --> 02:16:24,560
Which, by the way, don't worry about Star Wars spoilers.

3089
02:16:24,560 --> 02:16:26,040
Cause like none of us saw it.

3090
02:16:26,040 --> 02:16:27,520
No, wait, look, you saw it, right?

3091
02:16:27,520 --> 02:16:28,520
You know better though.

3092
02:16:28,520 --> 02:16:29,720
The rest of us didn't even bother seeing it.

3093
02:16:29,720 --> 02:16:31,280
So I don't hate Star Wars.

3094
02:16:31,280 --> 02:16:33,800
I just, I was not going to fight that theater crowd this weekend.

3095
02:16:33,800 --> 02:16:34,800
No ma'am.

3096
02:16:34,800 --> 02:16:35,800
I will.

3097
02:16:35,800 --> 02:16:36,800
Here's the thing though.

3098
02:16:36,800 --> 02:16:38,240
Like on, I took Friday off to go see stars.

3099
02:16:38,240 --> 02:16:41,040
I was actually going to see Star Wars and Thor, but after watching Star Wars, I got

3100
02:16:41,040 --> 02:16:43,040
burnt out just watching movies.

3101
02:16:43,040 --> 02:16:46,400
I'm like, I can't sit for another like two and a half hours through a movie.

3102
02:16:46,400 --> 02:16:47,560
It'll just waste my whole day.

3103
02:16:47,560 --> 02:16:49,160
I heard it's a long movie.

3104
02:16:49,160 --> 02:16:50,160
That's not a spoiler, right?

3105
02:16:50,160 --> 02:16:52,040
We can say it's long, long movie.

3106
02:16:52,040 --> 02:16:56,280
It doesn't, the pacing of it, it, it feels like if you actually looked at like all this

3107
02:16:56,280 --> 02:17:00,360
stuff on paper, it doesn't seem like much happens, but it, it was good.

3108
02:17:00,360 --> 02:17:01,360
I liked it.

3109
02:17:01,360 --> 02:17:03,920
It wasn't like, Oh my God, this is the most amazing thing ever.

3110
02:17:03,920 --> 02:17:06,560
But it wasn't like, Oh, I hate this thing.

3111
02:17:06,560 --> 02:17:08,560
Tiger class says it's two hours and 32 minutes.

3112
02:17:08,560 --> 02:17:11,120
So yeah, I mean it was fine.

3113
02:17:11,120 --> 02:17:13,800
There was, I liked it.

3114
02:17:13,800 --> 02:17:17,480
I mean, I don't know.

3115
02:17:17,480 --> 02:17:18,480
There's not much to say.

3116
02:17:18,480 --> 02:17:19,480
Just go see it.

3117
02:17:19,480 --> 02:17:25,880
But I see, I was lucky though, cause like our theaters nearby, they were open like fucking

3118
02:17:25,880 --> 02:17:26,880
early.

3119
02:17:26,880 --> 02:17:28,520
I mean, they had like, I saw it at nine o'clock.

3120
02:17:28,520 --> 02:17:29,520
They were running 24 hours.

3121
02:17:29,520 --> 02:17:30,520
Yeah.

3122
02:17:30,520 --> 02:17:31,880
I saw it at nine o'clock in the morning.

3123
02:17:31,880 --> 02:17:36,280
So I got that out of the way and went, finished Christmas shopping.

3124
02:17:36,280 --> 02:17:41,680
We were going to finally go see lady bird yesterday, but I took a nap instead.

3125
02:17:41,680 --> 02:17:43,800
But what we did, we were, we had some time to kill yesterday.

3126
02:17:43,800 --> 02:17:47,800
So I took you over to where some of the houses are in that movie because I know some of the

3127
02:17:47,800 --> 02:17:52,080
famous houses that are in that movie or in what they call the fab forties here in SAC.

3128
02:17:52,080 --> 02:17:54,160
And that's also where all the Christmas lights are this time of year.

3129
02:17:54,160 --> 02:17:55,880
So Oh my God, the traffic was terrible.

3130
02:17:55,880 --> 02:17:56,880
Yeah.

3131
02:17:57,320 --> 02:18:00,360
We didn't go down 40th or 41st, which are the worst.

3132
02:18:00,360 --> 02:18:04,280
We went down like 43rd and I was like, here's, here's the experience.

3133
02:18:04,280 --> 02:18:05,280
Like light.

3134
02:18:05,280 --> 02:18:06,280
Yeah.

3135
02:18:06,280 --> 02:18:12,080
And that was one of those courts by my house and it backs up traffic everywhere.

3136
02:18:12,080 --> 02:18:14,180
Do they synchronize with music and everything?

3137
02:18:14,180 --> 02:18:15,180
Only one of them.

3138
02:18:15,180 --> 02:18:19,120
Like they're all, it's like, it's basically all the people that live in this court, it's,

3139
02:18:19,120 --> 02:18:21,080
you have to put out lights every year.

3140
02:18:21,080 --> 02:18:25,480
And so like one of my coworkers actually that's in our department, he lives on that court

3141
02:18:25,680 --> 02:18:31,020
and he is talking about, I mean he likes doing it, he likes Christmas and stuff, but yeah,

3142
02:18:31,020 --> 02:18:34,760
it's insane because it's like, okay, y'all take me 30 minutes to get to my house from

3143
02:18:34,760 --> 02:18:35,760
the end of my court.

3144
02:18:35,760 --> 02:18:36,760
Oh geez.

3145
02:18:36,760 --> 02:18:38,680
Cause it's just moving so slow.

3146
02:18:38,680 --> 02:18:39,680
Yeah.

3147
02:18:39,680 --> 02:18:43,400
I'm so glad I live in an apartment where I don't have any pressure to decorate.

3148
02:18:43,400 --> 02:18:44,400
What was the other movie?

3149
02:18:44,400 --> 02:18:46,800
I said we should go see, Oh, the disaster artists, but you didn't, you didn't know what

3150
02:18:46,800 --> 02:18:47,800
the room was.

3151
02:18:47,800 --> 02:18:48,800
Right.

3152
02:18:48,800 --> 02:18:49,800
I've never seen the room.

3153
02:18:49,800 --> 02:18:50,800
Yeah.

3154
02:18:50,800 --> 02:18:51,800
So I want to see that too.

3155
02:18:52,120 --> 02:18:55,840
If I'm going to see a movie about a disaster, I want it to be about Aja.

3156
02:18:55,840 --> 02:18:58,160
All right.

3157
02:18:58,160 --> 02:18:59,440
Well I guess our phones are not lighting up.

3158
02:18:59,440 --> 02:19:01,080
I still want to see the shape of water.

3159
02:19:01,080 --> 02:19:02,080
Yeah.

3160
02:19:02,080 --> 02:19:03,080
You were mentioning that.

3161
02:19:03,080 --> 02:19:04,080
Very, very much.

3162
02:19:04,080 --> 02:19:05,080
Yeah.

3163
02:19:05,080 --> 02:19:06,080
Is Call Me By Your Name playing in Sacramento?

3164
02:19:06,080 --> 02:19:09,140
Cause I've heard a lot of good things about that, but I know it's an independent film

3165
02:19:09,140 --> 02:19:10,140
so it might be hard to buy.

3166
02:19:10,140 --> 02:19:12,440
Well believe it or not, Sacramento has indie theaters.

3167
02:19:12,440 --> 02:19:14,160
Do you have landmark?

3168
02:19:14,160 --> 02:19:16,560
There's the, no, there's Tower and Crest are the two.

3169
02:19:16,560 --> 02:19:18,600
Well actually Crest doesn't really show stuff anymore.

3170
02:19:18,600 --> 02:19:20,920
They have a single screen, so like it's harder.

3171
02:19:21,040 --> 02:19:22,240
The Tower has three screens.

3172
02:19:22,240 --> 02:19:23,240
Yeah.

3173
02:19:23,240 --> 02:19:25,400
Tower was where I saw, I've seen some crazy movies there.

3174
02:19:25,400 --> 02:19:26,400
Okay.

3175
02:19:26,400 --> 02:19:29,080
So, and you, you, you, whatever movie, I know we're getting Sacramento right now, but any,

3176
02:19:29,080 --> 02:19:31,360
any theater city you live in has an art theater.

3177
02:19:31,360 --> 02:19:32,360
Right?

3178
02:19:32,360 --> 02:19:33,360
Right.

3179
02:19:33,360 --> 02:19:35,240
That's where I saw a short bus was the Tower Theater.

3180
02:19:35,240 --> 02:19:38,280
No wait, no, I saw that at the Crest.

3181
02:19:38,280 --> 02:19:40,200
I saw that with you.

3182
02:19:40,200 --> 02:19:41,200
That's right.

3183
02:19:41,200 --> 02:19:44,400
And my old roommate, we all went, no, that was at the Crest, not the, not the, in the

3184
02:19:44,400 --> 02:19:45,400
basement at the Crest.

3185
02:19:45,400 --> 02:19:47,040
Cause I know I brought the screen.

3186
02:19:47,040 --> 02:19:48,040
Yeah.

3187
02:19:48,040 --> 02:19:50,720
That, that was the one that was by the Hedwig and the Angry Inch director, but it was like

3188
02:19:50,720 --> 02:19:52,000
super porn.

3189
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:56,680
Like it was just a movie that happened to have like, yeah, it was, it was, it was actually

3190
02:19:56,680 --> 02:19:57,680
a good movie.

3191
02:19:57,680 --> 02:20:00,280
It had the guy sucking his own dick.

3192
02:20:00,280 --> 02:20:01,280
Yes it did.

3193
02:20:01,280 --> 02:20:03,280
It was a good movie.

3194
02:20:03,280 --> 02:20:04,280
No.

3195
02:20:04,280 --> 02:20:05,280
Yeah.

3196
02:20:05,280 --> 02:20:06,280
And that's the weird thing about it.

3197
02:20:06,280 --> 02:20:09,320
Like you can say that I've ever seen auto fellatio that you can say that and still go,

3198
02:20:09,320 --> 02:20:13,660
but like actually it was a good movie, but I was the only one, see the controversial

3199
02:20:13,660 --> 02:20:17,440
thing about it is that everybody walked away going, it was a happy ending and I actually

3200
02:20:17,440 --> 02:20:19,800
walked out of there going, I actually thought that was like one of the saddest movies I've

3201
02:20:19,880 --> 02:20:20,880
ever seen.

3202
02:20:20,880 --> 02:20:21,880
Yeah.

3203
02:20:21,880 --> 02:20:22,880
Yeah.

3204
02:20:22,880 --> 02:20:25,360
So everybody kind of gets different things out of that.

3205
02:20:25,360 --> 02:20:28,000
So there you go.

3206
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:32,160
So a lot of these artsy movies though, since you kind of got us on that topic, a lot of

3207
02:20:32,160 --> 02:20:36,780
the artsy movies don't really show up till January because they're just coming out limited

3208
02:20:36,780 --> 02:20:38,780
engagement so they can qualify for the Oscars.

3209
02:20:38,780 --> 02:20:41,760
Like I don't know if that call me by your name is going to be eligible for it.

3210
02:20:41,760 --> 02:20:45,520
Like if they're talking about Oscars for it or whatever, it's been out definitely in theaters

3211
02:20:45,520 --> 02:20:46,600
in December.

3212
02:20:46,600 --> 02:20:49,420
So if that's what they're doing, then it would qualify.

3213
02:20:49,420 --> 02:20:52,680
So Tower has Darkest Hour, which I haven't heard of that.

3214
02:20:52,680 --> 02:20:53,800
That's Gary Oldman.

3215
02:20:53,800 --> 02:20:57,240
They have Lady Bird, but that makes sense because Tower Theater is in that movie.

3216
02:20:57,240 --> 02:20:59,380
And then Three Billboards Outside Ebbing.

3217
02:20:59,380 --> 02:21:01,060
Oh, I've heard of that one too.

3218
02:21:01,060 --> 02:21:02,060
Yeah.

3219
02:21:02,060 --> 02:21:03,060
That is there too.

3220
02:21:03,060 --> 02:21:04,060
And then I don't know if the Crest is even on the list.

3221
02:21:04,060 --> 02:21:06,940
I know Crest is on the list, but they don't have anything today.

3222
02:21:06,940 --> 02:21:11,060
The Crest now like sticks to like one time shows, like they'll show It's a Wonderful

3223
02:21:11,060 --> 02:21:12,940
Life at some point during the season.

3224
02:21:12,940 --> 02:21:16,500
They're kind of like the Castro theater, but like not as cool.

3225
02:21:16,500 --> 02:21:18,100
Well, of course not.

3226
02:21:18,100 --> 02:21:19,820
It's not in the gay neighborhood.

3227
02:21:19,820 --> 02:21:21,300
Oh yeah.

3228
02:21:21,300 --> 02:21:22,300
Tiger Claw.

3229
02:21:22,300 --> 02:21:23,300
That's the other movie I want to see.

3230
02:21:23,300 --> 02:21:24,300
I, Tonya.

3231
02:21:24,300 --> 02:21:25,300
The one about Tonya Harding.

3232
02:21:25,300 --> 02:21:28,020
I live for Tonya Harding, Nancy Kerrigan's Scandal.

3233
02:21:28,020 --> 02:21:29,620
There's a great documentary on Netflix.

3234
02:21:29,620 --> 02:21:31,700
You've heard the Seshvan Stevens song.

3235
02:21:31,700 --> 02:21:32,900
Yes, the Tonya Harding.

3236
02:21:32,900 --> 02:21:36,380
Which was not actually part of the movie, but he wrote it around the same time and they

3237
02:21:36,380 --> 02:21:37,380
didn't use it.

3238
02:21:37,380 --> 02:21:38,380
Yeah.

3239
02:21:38,380 --> 02:21:39,380
Why not?

3240
02:21:39,380 --> 02:21:40,380
Why not write a song about Tonya Harding?

3241
02:21:40,380 --> 02:21:43,120
I mean, I think they just didn't need it, but he wanted to do it anyway.

3242
02:21:43,120 --> 02:21:45,620
So he's going to do what he's going to do.

3243
02:21:46,140 --> 02:21:49,420
Anyhow, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

3244
02:21:49,420 --> 02:21:52,420
I think we've really covered it all tonight.

3245
02:21:52,420 --> 02:21:53,420
Thank you guys.

3246
02:21:53,420 --> 02:21:58,160
And no matter what it is you celebrate this holiday season, we hope you have a great holiday.

3247
02:21:58,160 --> 02:22:02,220
We will see you again live in January in a few weeks.

3248
02:22:02,220 --> 02:22:07,060
Meanwhile, for our podcast listeners, we will be, which hopefully are the live listeners

3249
02:22:07,060 --> 02:22:10,900
too, we will be joining you for a special episode at some point during the break.

3250
02:22:10,900 --> 02:22:14,220
Hey, if you liked what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, be sure to leave us a five star

3251
02:22:14,260 --> 02:22:18,260
review on a site like iTunes or wherever it is you found this podcast, because word of

3252
02:22:18,260 --> 02:22:19,540
mouth is all we've got.

3253
02:22:19,540 --> 02:22:22,780
So you don't have to send us hazelnut Oreos like Act Def did.

3254
02:22:22,780 --> 02:22:24,280
You can just leave us a really nice review.

3255
02:22:24,280 --> 02:22:29,060
And that is a Christmas present or a Hanukkah present or whatever it is you want in December

3256
02:22:29,060 --> 02:22:31,340
present that we can all enjoy.

3257
02:22:31,340 --> 02:22:33,940
In fact, presents actually don't have to be limited to December.

3258
02:22:33,940 --> 02:22:35,060
You know, there you go.

3259
02:22:35,060 --> 02:22:37,780
You can, an unbirthday present can be any time of year.

3260
02:22:37,780 --> 02:22:38,780
JD, thank you for being here tonight.

3261
02:22:38,780 --> 02:22:39,780
Thank you for having me.

3262
02:22:39,780 --> 02:22:40,780
Hope you had a good time.

3263
02:22:40,780 --> 02:22:42,300
Oh, it's always a blast.

3264
02:22:42,300 --> 02:22:43,300
It's always fun.

3265
02:22:43,620 --> 02:22:45,820
What do people need to know about the experience of being here?

3266
02:22:45,820 --> 02:22:49,100
Like, because you listen to this when you're not here and then you're here.

3267
02:22:49,100 --> 02:22:52,420
What do people that are listening that have ever been here need to know about the being

3268
02:22:52,420 --> 02:22:54,120
here experience?

3269
02:22:54,120 --> 02:22:55,120
It's really hard to describe.

3270
02:22:55,120 --> 02:22:58,660
I don't, I'd have to, I'd have to think about that one before answering it.

3271
02:22:58,660 --> 02:22:59,660
That's a very good non-answer.

3272
02:22:59,660 --> 02:23:00,660
All right.

3273
02:23:00,660 --> 02:23:05,860
We've, we've been giggling though, like little school girls over here at Drag Queens.

3274
02:23:05,860 --> 02:23:10,060
Although this picture that I just posted of Raja is glorious.

3275
02:23:10,100 --> 02:23:11,820
Dungeon Buster says, thanks for an epic year.

3276
02:23:11,820 --> 02:23:13,820
OLR, rock on safely into the holidays.

3277
02:23:13,820 --> 02:23:14,820
Hey, will do.

3278
02:23:14,820 --> 02:23:15,820
Uh, 2018.

3279
02:23:15,820 --> 02:23:18,420
I know we don't want to get too much into like resolutions and stuff.

3280
02:23:18,420 --> 02:23:22,380
We'll talk about that on our bonus show, but I definitely am going to get back into streaming.

3281
02:23:22,380 --> 02:23:24,180
It's just, you guys know it's been a bad year for me.

3282
02:23:24,180 --> 02:23:27,460
So, but I really do have fun when I do streaming, so I'm going to, I'm actually going to try

3283
02:23:27,460 --> 02:23:31,060
and do the schedule thing, which can be a little weird for me, but there might be some

3284
02:23:31,060 --> 02:23:34,860
new podcast projects in 2018 to Jamie and I've been talking about something for a long

3285
02:23:34,860 --> 02:23:35,860
time.

3286
02:23:36,220 --> 02:23:41,220
My buddy, my buddy Victoria is like hell bent on making something happen and I think she'd

3287
02:23:41,220 --> 02:23:42,220
be really good.

3288
02:23:42,220 --> 02:23:44,420
She's kind of one of those people who doesn't have a podcast right now who kind of needs

3289
02:23:44,420 --> 02:23:45,420
one.

3290
02:23:45,420 --> 02:23:46,580
So I'm looking forward to that.

3291
02:23:46,580 --> 02:23:49,420
So anyway, uh, that's going to do it.

3292
02:23:49,420 --> 02:23:52,940
Let's go around and get everybody's final fricking thoughts for the year.

3293
02:23:52,940 --> 02:23:54,820
I guess final live thoughts for the year.

3294
02:23:54,820 --> 02:23:55,820
Anyway.

3295
02:23:55,820 --> 02:23:57,580
Uh, JD, do you have anything we should let our guests go first?

3296
02:23:57,580 --> 02:23:59,580
You have a final thought?

3297
02:23:59,580 --> 02:24:03,020
Um, no, I don't have anything right away.

3298
02:24:03,020 --> 02:24:04,020
All right.

3299
02:24:04,020 --> 02:24:05,020
That's fine.

3300
02:24:05,180 --> 02:24:06,180
Final thought tonight.

3301
02:24:06,180 --> 02:24:12,380
I'm worried I lost my dongle for my new phone because no, because I got a, I got pixel two

3302
02:24:12,380 --> 02:24:17,140
today so I upgraded my Samsung galaxy S six to a pixel two and they, since it doesn't

3303
02:24:17,140 --> 02:24:22,380
have a headphone jack, it has a dongle for it and Jack and I was like, man, I gotta find

3304
02:24:22,380 --> 02:24:26,380
a place to put this so I don't lose it and I put it, I thought I put in my back pocket

3305
02:24:26,380 --> 02:24:29,780
so I don't, maybe I didn't bring it to the show because I didn't think I was going to

3306
02:24:29,780 --> 02:24:33,620
be using my headphones, but that's going to be a real issue because I know I'm going to

3307
02:24:33,620 --> 02:24:37,660
lose that thing and also like, I guess I have to zip tie it to my headphones I use

3308
02:24:37,660 --> 02:24:40,420
because that's really the only, I've heard the apple one is cheaper if you need to buy

3309
02:24:40,420 --> 02:24:41,420
a replacement.

3310
02:24:41,420 --> 02:24:47,740
Well, it's used to be type C. That's a fun, well, Loki, sorry about your dongle, but I

3311
02:24:47,740 --> 02:24:48,920
love my new phone.

3312
02:24:48,920 --> 02:24:49,920
It's super snappy.

3313
02:24:49,920 --> 02:24:50,920
All right.

3314
02:24:50,920 --> 02:24:55,900
Uh, my final thought for the night is just thank you guys.

3315
02:24:55,900 --> 02:25:00,300
I know it's been a, an up and down year just, you know, for obviously for me personally,

3316
02:25:00,300 --> 02:25:04,260
but it's affected the show and we've gone like several weeks without some shows and

3317
02:25:04,260 --> 02:25:07,180
I really hate to do that, but I just, I really want to thank you guys who've like stuck by

3318
02:25:07,180 --> 02:25:11,460
us through the crazy fucking year that is 2017.

3319
02:25:11,460 --> 02:25:16,560
Um, and we're going to carry this show on into 2018 and who fucking knows when we're

3320
02:25:16,560 --> 02:25:17,820
going to run out of steam.

3321
02:25:17,820 --> 02:25:18,820
Who knows?

3322
02:25:18,820 --> 02:25:19,820
We haven't yet.

3323
02:25:19,820 --> 02:25:24,660
Well, not anytime soon cause dark soccer just got a steam gift card, but anyway, last but

3324
02:25:24,660 --> 02:25:27,220
not least, we're going to be posting from the grave anyway.

3325
02:25:27,220 --> 02:25:29,820
The OLR way here at the end of the show.

3326
02:25:29,820 --> 02:25:31,420
Ladies last.

3327
02:25:31,420 --> 02:25:32,420
Your final thought.

3328
02:25:32,420 --> 02:25:34,020
Save the best for last.

3329
02:25:34,020 --> 02:25:35,020
Sure.

3330
02:25:35,020 --> 02:25:36,020
Um, right.

3331
02:25:36,020 --> 02:25:37,580
Um, act deft.

3332
02:25:37,580 --> 02:25:44,700
I love you for the gift of hazelnut and um, reject false icons next year.

3333
02:25:44,700 --> 02:25:45,700
New year.

3334
02:25:45,700 --> 02:25:46,700
New me.

3335
02:25:46,700 --> 02:25:47,700
All right.

3336
02:25:47,700 --> 02:25:48,700
We'll see you next time.

3337
02:25:48,700 --> 02:25:49,700
New, new year.

3338
02:25:49,700 --> 02:25:50,700
New OLR.

3339
02:25:50,700 --> 02:25:51,700
New, new lol.

3340
02:25:51,700 --> 02:25:52,700
No, no.

3341
02:25:52,700 --> 02:25:53,700
That doesn't work.

3342
02:25:53,700 --> 02:25:54,700
New Orleans.

3343
02:25:54,700 --> 02:25:55,700
New Orleans.

3344
02:25:55,700 --> 02:25:56,700
Let's move to New Orleans.

3345
02:25:57,180 --> 02:25:58,180
Let's go to new Orleans.

3346
02:25:58,180 --> 02:26:02,820
See you in 2018 live from Southern decadence.

3347

Good night, everybody.
