00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This week we've learned that Pokemon feign apparently due to quote, extreme weather against their frail bodies. What onyx wants moss growing on the north facing side anyway? This is just one story in tonight's news of a war, law, and more and it all starts right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight, episode number 710 for this December the 10th of 2017.

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:59,000
My name is Rob Roberts, here with you over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle. If you want, you can follow me on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E. And if you want, you can follow her on Twitter at DarkSakura O-L-R, right? DarkSakura underscore O-R.

7
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
No, it's just DarkSakura.

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Oh, is it on Twitter it is?

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
My YouTube is DarkSakura O-L-R, which doesn't have really any content other than Julian saying Dalek when he was 3.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
That would have a million views I would think.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
No, it has like 20.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Well, how are you DarkSakura?

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm feeling better now that I've got food in me.

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm glad you're feeling good. I was sick all week.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Who had to go to the Ingress thing last week, Rob?

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Yes, I did the Ingress thing last week and clearly I caught something there. Well, you guys didn't get sick luckily.

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You run all these diseased people.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:39,000
But I'm actually kind of happy we had the shorter show last week because once you guys left, and you know sometimes I'll do Twitch streaming after the show, but I was like, I just don't know if I feel it last week.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And then sure enough after you guys left I'm like, uh oh, scratchy throat, sniffly nose.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And then I wake up Monday morning and it's just like, dun dun dun, you're sick.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And it's like these symptoms, I can't shake them at all.

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Clearly, he caught the Jarvis virus.

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Uh, leave.

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And that's the shit I've been putting up with for over 15 years over there from Techmaster Loki.

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I hope you're not feeling like crap like I've been.

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:15,000
No, I just have a minor cold, I guess. It's just like the end of a minor cold, so no, I'm okay.

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I've actually been kind of tired, but I'm sticking to it because I will be off work for a month at the end of the year.

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Oh boy. Alright.

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And I actually may miss a couple of shows after that, so I'll go ahead and let everyone know for the five people who appreciate me on this show.

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Oh, stop.

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Well, I'm sorry, I have to go in the kitchen and make a sandwich.

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Oh yeah, that was the Twitter thing.

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And I'm still mocking them 15 years later.

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Yeah, actually, if Jamie were to make you a sandwich, she'd be pretty lucky. She's a pretty good cook.

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
But she's under no obligation to do any such thing.

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
But that's right, next weekend we'll have to make latkes.

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Oh yeah.

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's the Hanukkah latke fest.

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Yeah, latke show.

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Yay!

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I have to mention, my kids like watching crap on Netflix, and they have all the holiday shows or episodes for different shows on Netflix, so one of those is home.

43
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And they have a song in there called Eight Days of Latkes.

44
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Oh, that sounds great.

45
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's fucking awesome. It's just a hilarious song, but I thought of you.

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Oh.

47
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So you said there you wanted to let the five thousand people that like you know.

48
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Five.

49
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Hundred thousand.

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Whatever.

51
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So yeah, I'll be off the show for a couple weeks, but it's nothing, you know, crazy. It'll just be, I'll be recovering from some surgery. That's all.

52
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
All right. Well, we'll miss you.

53
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
What will you throw? Will you throw latkes at me?

54
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Sure.

55
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Okay.

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I am scheduling, just so you know, in your absence, I am working on, I need to figure out what days specifically you're not going to be here, but I am working on that Babes of Ingress edition when you're not here.

57
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm actually kind of bummed you won't be here, but I wanted to have some strong females on the show.

58
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Maybe I can do a phone in.

59
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Yeah, of course. That would be fun.

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
If I'm not, you know, feeling like bleh.

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
All right. Well, anyway, let's get into video games because we are a show that talks about video games and culture and all that.

62
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And food.

63
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And once in a while, food. And I know I talk about this. I kind of repeat this story every few months, but with as long as this show has been around and the discoverability of this and the word of mouth and everything.

64
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I know sometimes you guys find OLR. You know, you may not have even realized this show has been around as long as it has.

65
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
We're like a really good kept secret on the internet. Like a really, really, really good kept secret.

66
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Because like, we're everyone's sassy aunt.

67
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Like Jamie said, only five people really know.

68
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:39,000
But no, we love our chatters. There's much more than five of you there in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

69
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
We do tape live, of course, every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at the Voice Geeks Network.

70
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
vognetwork.com where you can find lots of hidden secret great podcasts over there, such as The Geek Card.

71
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's just back from hiatus. Shout out to The Geek Card.

72
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Lovely duo over there from Europe that talks about a lot of different geeky things.

73
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And let's see, what other show am I going to spotlight?

74
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Oh, Electric Sisterhood. I don't talk about them enough.

75
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I love those two girls, though, and they talk about video games as well.

76
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
But there's tons of room for lots of video gaming shows on the network.

77
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So, oh, I have to give one more shout out because I'm not sure if I'm supposed to say this,

78
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
but it was on social media and it wasn't marked private.

79
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So congratulations to Captain Spike at Game Buoy because he got engaged.

80
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
All right. So those are some shows at VOG Network.

81
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
But the story I like to tell every few months here at OLR or so is how we all met.

82
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Because where did Orange Launch Radio come from?

83
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Why are you called Orange Launch Radio?

84
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Because myself, DarkSakura, Loki, we all played a game called Dance Dance Revolution at the arcades.

85
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And this was back in the day when arcades actually had people that visited them regularly for not ticket-spitting games.

86
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And we didn't give a shit if y'all were on our lawn.

87
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You had fans of street-fighting games.

88
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Dude, SVGL was Capcom's test place.

89
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
So that was like rival schools.

90
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Racing games, because that's right when like, not Wangan, but the other one.

91
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Initial D. Why can't I remember that?

92
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
That's like right when Initial D was starting to take off and all that.

93
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So you had racing games, fighting games, other types of games, and music games.

94
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:19,000
So we all met playing a game called Dance Dance Revolution, which was a part of a series by a video game company.

95
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You all know, unfortunately, in the past couple of years, it's mostly negative reasons,

96
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
but Konami used to be a very different company.

97
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
They had more offices, more production teams, and so forth.

98
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And they were responsible for a lot of these different types of games that they put under a series called Bomani.

99
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Well, the reason why I bring all of this up this week and tell this story again,

100
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
even though I'm a broken record to some of you long-time listeners,

101
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
is that Bomani actually turned 20 years old this past week.

102
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Because the original Beatmania, so that was the very first game that started the whole thing off.

103
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Bomani, Beatmania, get it right? So Beatmania came out December 10, 1997.

104
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm sorry, 98, that's right.

105
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
No, no, 97, because it's 20 years old. DDR came out in 98.

106
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
That's right, I was playing BM98, because that was one of the...

107
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Like the simulators, right?

108
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Yeah, so yeah.

109
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
No, but the original Beatmania, and it's so close to the end of the year too,

110
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
but technically the original Beatmania was December of 1997, so it turned 20 years old this past week.

111
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So I thought it would be worth acknowledging that here at the top of the show,

112
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
that this series, that this show basically owes its thanks to.

113
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And if you didn't know, Orange Lounge is the name of one of the in-house bands that did songs in DDR.

114
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And so we kind of picked that as our name because not only the ties to Bomani Games,

115
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
which we were exclusively talking about in those first few years of the show,

116
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
but just the fact that we're lounging around talking about games, I don't know.

117
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Does that kind of still work? Do you picture us all kind of in big orange furniture talking about games,

118
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
even though the furniture actually really is an orange? Spoiler alert.

119
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
But it could be. I did find an orange couch not that long ago, and I thought about it.

120
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I really thought about it. Anyway, let's see.

121
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
We're going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

122
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
S2100 Matt says, Golfland was the place back in the day.

123
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I know Mesa Golfland got a lot of things early. Yeah, there was more Golflands a few years ago, too.

124
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Some of them have closed since then.

125
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
ActDeft points out the song 1998 in DDR Extreme.

126
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Yes, but that is because of DDR's anniversary, which was the next year where Dance Dance Revolution came from.

127
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,000
But without BeatMania, we would not have Dance Dance Revolution or anything that really came after that,

128
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
which DDR is really still out there today.

129
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I know it kind of hibernated for a few years, but there's been some more recent mixes lately,

130
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
and there's kind of a whole bunch of new community that's really into this DDR ace.

131
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I know they're doing an old-school freestyle tournament next month I talked about a few weeks ago,

132
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
so I'm very excited to check that out in January in San Jose.

133
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
So, yeah, lots to get excited about.

134
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Anyway, before we get into some of the more current gaming news,

135
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
because I know we want to get into the game awards and some of those announcements and so forth,

136
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I want to just quickly kind of ask, how did my co-hosts, how did you guys get introduced to BeatMania or whatever music game it was?

137
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:23,000
How did you get introduced to it, which ultimately led you basically to finding each other at Golf Land where this show came from? Loki.

138
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I think I saw a DDR fourth mix at an anime expo.

139
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
So I saw it at Fanime. They had it set up in an arcade room.

140
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I was like, what the hell is that? I'm like, I've never seen anything like that.

141
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And they bought the soundtrack, and I just kind of got interested in it.

142
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
And then I ended up in the arcade, and there was.

143
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
How about you, DarkSagra?

144
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I first heard of BeatMania when I was still living in Alabama, because I moved out here in 98.

145
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
No, 99. I take that back. I moved out here in 99.

146
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And then I had gotten into playing BM98, so I had the little emulator,

147
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
you know, where I was playing a lot of BM98, and I really enjoyed it. It had all the songs.

148
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And then I moved out here. Was it 98 I moved out? Yeah, I think it was 98 that I moved out here. Anyway.

149
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:26,000
And then I don't even know what it was, but I think it was the very next year was when Dan got me second mix for my birthday on Dreamcast.

150
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Yeah, it had to have been somewhere. Yeah, somewhere around there, because we already had our import Dreamcast for a while.

151
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I may be getting my ears kind of mixed up because I'm old, but I had I had gone on this rampage hunting down DVR machines,

152
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,000
and there was the one at Country Club Lanes, and then they eventually got one at Crestview Lanes.

153
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,000
And Crestview is like, wait, how did that was also the only place I've ever seen a Blazing Star arcade machine short of California Extreme.

154
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:03,000
But yeah, I just like really got into it. And then I started getting into all the other Bemani. So the effort for me, it started with BeatMania.

155
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
First time I ever met you. First time I ever met you is when we took a road trip from here in SAC.

156
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Some of us DVR players. We took a road trip to Milpitas Golf Land. I think it was to play Pata Pata Paradise, whatever, which had just come out or at least made it over here.

157
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I stayed up all night watching videos to learn some of the dances. I love it. Yeah, that's awesome. I only need like half of them.

158
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I don't remember the I actually don't remember the very first time I met Loki. I think it was just some random Roseville Golf Land night, because I think that's just kind of where we connected.

159
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Probably thanks to DVR Freak. So I just remember what this is really the early days of O.L.R.

160
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:47,000
But I remember, which will always crack me up to this day, the contest that you did, because you used to be able to edit step files on a PlayStation one version of the game.

161
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
You could actually bring your memory card and plug it in. Well, we were to that distribution play.

162
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Yeah. When Loki worked for the video distribution place, he used to have all these like Skinemax films that he would just get for free.

163
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,000
You know, so he did a contest once called Make Edit, Get Porn. Yes. It was a part of O.L.R.

164
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I think we covered it in the early, early episodes. So you did the Make Edit, Get Porn contest and that that skinny guy, Dave, won, right?

165
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Yeah. Which I wonder what ever happened to that kid. There's so many people from the early days.

166
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:20,000
O.L.R. I have no idea where they went these days. Yeah. Or I'll see. I'll see people like Puppy. You remember Puppy? He's coming to the show all the time.

167
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Like I see him and his daughter and I'm like, wait a minute, you used to be the young kid that was always on the show.

168
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
He does a lot of really cool like Star Wars stuff now. He can actually like lightsaber battle.

169
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
That's cool. I'm going to have to do like a where, where are they now?

170
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Dark Tetsuya did a pretty good one when our show turned 10.

171
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
But I need to get like some audio or some video of some like the where are they now of the early O.L.R. people.

172
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I still have the memory card with my another edit on it for.

173
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Crap, I don't even remember what song it was, but I knew it was called Another because I made the steps go with the rhythm of the another version of music.

174
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
And so I actually used that one. Now that I think about it, I think Sinon was the one that that beat it.

175
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I don't remember what his nickname was on DDR freak. But I said, if anyone can beat it, I'll buy them a tenner.

176
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,000
He beat it. I saw my memory cards there in a pouch. I know exactly where they are, actually.

177
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I have my Final Fantasy 7 save card, which was on a third party one that didn't lose all of its files.

178
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I can still kill Aerith over and over. S2-100 Matt in chat says Drew is still the intern.

179
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
He is. He'll always be the intern. But he kind of grew up at some point. He's my coworker. Yeah, right.

180
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Yeah, he grew up at some point. Anyway, Drew was a reference for my job. Quickly, my story.

181
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I first saw it. So here's the funny thing. I randomly ended up at Milpitas Golf Land because Milpitas is right next to Fremont.

182
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:56,000
And I was in Fremont because I was part of a live shadow cast screening of Shock Treatment, which is the not quite sequel to the Rocky Horror Picture Show.

183
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:03,000
So they actually released a few years later a movie called Shock Treatment. And once in a blue moon, you'll find a group crazy enough to actually do a shadow cast of it.

184
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:10,000
So anyway, so I was in the fridge. So my friend and I were like, let's go to this arcade that's nearby. And it was huge. I remember.

185
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:17,000
So we dipped in there and I remember seeing the machine and people were doing crazy shit like doing like the matrix walks and the flips and stuff.

186
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'm almost positive because it was Memorial Day weekend. I think we walked into during a DDR tournament during like the first Milpitas tournament.

187
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I think we walked into that. And so that's kind of how I was introduced to DDR. But it wasn't until a year later when I was in Las Vegas again for Rocky Horror Picture Show.

188
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:46,000
This is the Rocky Horror Picture Show 25th anniversary, which by the way, the movie is now 42. But this is the 20. Actually, I think it's older than that. No, 42. It was the 25th.

189
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It is now the meaning of life.

190
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:57,000
It was the Hard Rock Hotel, but we were staying at because we were all young 20 somethings. We were fucking broke. So we were staying at Circus Circus. Like what?

191
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,000
So Circus Circus is neat. Don't knock it. I don't know. You don't go there in your 30s if you don't have kids.

192
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I did. Did you? I think it's so gross now. I don't like Circus Circus at all.

193
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Because I went with Jessica one time when we were still associating. And we actually went to that Circus Circus a couple of times.

194
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:22,000
The one in Vegas or the one in Reno? The one in Vegas. Because we went to watch the performers. I cleaned out their crane games and we went to play DDR in the basement.

195
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Maybe I'm just being not nice. And then we drunk called you. Because I always think of the one in Reno, which is not quite as nice.

196
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:36,000
But then we drunk called you and that was funny. I know. I know. Anyway, so anyway, the point is, I don't know if it's still there, but they had this place called the Adventure Dome.

197
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:46,000
That was where all the arcade stuff was. So we were in the arcade and we saw this DDR machine. Jessica was there with me who used to be on Understation Live here on this network.

198
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,000
She actually, better known in the DDR community as Iguana Girl, she ran those boards on DDR Freak for a few years.

199
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:00,000
So anyway, her and I actually first saw this machine. It was like we were just kind of staring at it with hearts in our eyes going, we gotta play this.

200
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:12,000
That was right when I was playing Busta Groove in the US. I know, but that's what we called it. We were playing Busta Groove 2 all the time.

201
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:21,000
So we saw this game and you get hooked. It's like Busta Groove in real life. Kinda. That's kind of what it was.

202
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:35,000
And, you know, we saw the game over there and, you know, we hear the little, you know, you know, like the cheesy, you can't help but love DDR music the first time you hear it. You just really can't.

203
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I'm actually trying to remember what my first DDR machine was. I know what my first DDR machine was. It was Anime Expo 2000, I think it was, where it was the Disneyland Hotel.

204
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:58,000
And it was also the year of the chair. You know, the year that everyone started screaming for the chair because there was a chair left on stage. And we camped out in the room playing Third Mix.

205
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Yeah, you guys stayed up all night. I know, I know. But mine was the original DDR that I guess got imported. But it's this song. It's this fucking song.

206
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
That was actually manufactured for the US market.

207
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It's this song.

208
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:22,000
That was the first song I saw. Not Butterfly, but actually I remember now seeing someone playing Beatmania and they were playing Metal Gear Solid.

209
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
And I was like, oh man, that's so awesome, I gotta get that.

210
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:33,000
You know what made me feel kinda old on that particular event with the Third Mix? Was walking around singing along with Xanadu because I was super happy.

211
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Because I'm one of seven people in the world that like Xanadu. And I was singing along with it and my friend's like, I thought you never played this before.

212
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
You bitch. This movie is old, okay? It was old then.

213
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
What is Mr. Smoosh doing?

214
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
He's playing in bags.

215
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
And then I discovered the Olivia Project.

216
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
So anyway, I never finished my story.

217
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Sorry.

218
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
No, that's okay. The end of my story is-

219
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Not sorry.

220
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
It's gonna be one of those nights here at OLR. Let's just be real. It always is one of those nights at OLR.

221
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:11,000
The fact is, we started playing this game and we couldn't fucking stop playing. We just played all fucking night and suddenly it was- we missed Shock Treatment.

222
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Again, it always comes back to this fucking movie Shock Treatment that ruined my life.

223
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
We missed the Shock Treatment screening on Friday because we were playing DDR all fucking night.

224
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:32,000
So that's the end of the story. I think I went on this new tool called the internet and I found out that Roseville Golf Land had a DDR machine so I just kind of went over there.

225
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Princess Irene, I'm pretty sure, was a part of this too. We all went over there and that's when we met the rest of you and OLR started from there.

226
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Friends with- crap, why can't I remember her name now? Who ended up marrying your ex-roommate?

227
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Oh yeah, that whole thing. Those people, yes.

228
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:59,000
But that's where I met her. And that also led to me meeting more people too. And then it just kind of grew from there and that became our hub.

229
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I remember that we had a birthday party for somebody there.

230
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
And I'm pretty sure it was that same girl you were referencing. But it was the Cheers bar of nerds.

231
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
And then we went to Brookfield's.

232
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Yes. Anyway, I just had to acknowledge the whole Bamani being 20 years old here at the top of the show because obviously without it we wouldn't have OLR.

233
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
So I'm very excited to see what the future looks like.

234
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I miss Rick.

235
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Oh yeah, where is that? I fucking worship Rick. I remember that guy.

236
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Yeah, he got married to Mary.

237
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Worship Mary, yeah.

238
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
And then they vanished.

239
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I hope they're okay. Rick, Mary, if you're out there we miss you.

240
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Yeah.

241
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It was a call. Anyway, what was I going to say? What was his cousin? Timmy?

242
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Timmy, who was the son of the person.

243
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
He had a well-known family, yeah.

244
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Whose friend tried to stalk me.

245
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
And I don't remember.

246
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Yeah, his friend was sending me harassing messages. And so I IP traced him and got his address.

247
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Because back then it was actually easier to do it. You know VPNs and all that were still new.

248
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:14,000
And so I sent him a NetSend. Not a NetSend. I messaged him somehow. Linked his address and IP.

249
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I was like, you talk to me again and I'm going to report you to the police.

250
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
And Timmy apologized to me.

251
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Well Timmy was a good young citizen.

252
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
That hung out with assholes.

253
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Well, a lot of little boys hang out with assholes. Anyway.

254
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Where was I?

255
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I don't know, you're pointing at me or like shaking me.

256
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I know, I was shaking my finger at you for some reason, I don't remember.

257
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
We were talking about, I wanted to get into another topic, but I guess, oh, I know what it was.

258
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Because before the show. So our pal, Shane, is in Japan right now.

259
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
And he's been taking video of all these games.

260
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:52,000
And so speaking of like the future of Bomani, you were mentioning, did you see this one that has been around there?

261
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
And I know, I think he posted a video of this too.

262
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Dance Rush is what it's called. So it kind of looks a little bit like DDR.

263
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
But imagine if you were playing DDR but stepping on a giant touchpad.

264
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
So there's not really necessarily arrows that you follow.

265
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:14,000
It's kind of like, a little bit like, I guess, when they tried to do the connect stuff with DDR.

266
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Where you'd have to jump and move your arms in certain ways and stuff.

267
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
So basically, the entire stage has this pixelated look on it.

268
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
And everywhere you step, it just makes glitter and explosions everywhere.

269
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Oh, I know what this is. It was originally called Step Star.

270
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
And so they have this like...

271
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
It's definitely an evolved version of it.

272
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
It's first beta was called Step Star.

273
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Okay.

274
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Because that sounds like Step Star. I'm going to look it up.

275
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
So then, so basically, yeah. So you have all this stuff and they integrate like slides in there.

276
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
So you have to like step with certain feet on certain things.

277
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
You have to kind of drag your feet along the ground to match where, you know, the highlights are.

278
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
And then there's spots where you have to jump and spots where you have to kind of like dip down a little bit.

279
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Okay, here's the problem. When I started playing DDR, I was 22, 23.

280
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
By the time I get to one of these machines, I'm going to be 40.

281
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
So am I going to be able to do this? I don't think so.

282
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I don't know. It's a little less, you know, fast paced it seemed like from the stuff I saw.

283
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
But what's kind of cool about it too is they also have like this like selfie.

284
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
It records video footage, which is kind of cool.

285
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:24,000
So you can actually watch yourself play and they add the like stupid like, you know, Instagram effects and shit on there.

286
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
So it looks cool.

287
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
All right. So here's are the names it's gone through.

288
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
It was first Stepstar in July, then Shuffle Dancers with a Z.

289
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Shuffle?

290
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Shuffle.

291
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Oh, Shuffle.

292
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Then Dance Generations in September.

293
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
And so now I guess it's supposed to be its final name.

294
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I like Dance Rush. I like that better.

295
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Stepstar is okay, but the other two I don't like.

296
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
It looks cool though. I would like to try it.

297
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:58,000
So anyway, so the future of Bomani is, you know, even though Konami has made some interesting life choices, you know,

298
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:06,000
as one of our favorite drag queens on television, Dark Sakura, likes to say choices when it comes to

299
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
The singing of Sassy Gay Friend. Look at your life. Look at your choices.

300
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,000
When it comes to Konami lately, we hope the Bomani series will stay strong and even stuff that isn't technically Bomani,

301
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:23,000
but I'm sure owes, you know, a lot to the music gaming community and music games becoming bigger, such as DJ Max.

302
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I know he's had a presence at PSX this weekend and, you know, I think will come up later in the show.

303
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
We're going to be talking about that that is releasing in the US, which I think is a great thing.

304
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
So, you know, all the music games, it's going to be great.

305
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:42,000
So anyway, transitioning into, we're going to get into a little more current stuff like what's been going on this week.

306
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:48,000
However, you know, here at OLR, because we have been doing this show for over 15 years, we're a little bit of a family,

307
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
just us, you know, here in the room as well with, you know, you guys out there that listen to us every week.

308
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,000
So on that note, it's the holidays and sometimes during the holidays, you do nice things for your friends,

309
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,000
which I think Dark Sakura has done tonight. Do you want to set this up, Dark Sakura, with what you brought to the studio tonight?

310
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Yeah, I brought presents.

311
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
So, you're early, but actually no, because I guess Hanukkah is this next week, right?

312
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Yeah. Okay, so you're not that early.

313
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Yeah, so Rob and I put together for Loki's present.

314
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,000
And then I helped. I incorporated every few of your suggestions and then went a little crazy.

315
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
So it's for you and Alan to share.

316
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Okay, I'm excited. Well, Alan's not here, but he might be listening.

317
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
No, go ahead and open it.

318
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Well, Loki, you open yours first because this is one we both went in on because Jamie, you know, what do you think Loki would like?

319
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,000
And we bounced some ideas back and forth and we kind of landed on an idea and was like, yes, they didn't have flamethrowers.

320
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Yes. Yeah, they didn't have flamethrowers. So hopefully, so he's opening it now.

321
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,000
He's rifling through the, he's giggling at what he's pulling out and sure enough, domino rally racing.

322
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
That's right. We got him domino rally because we talked about it in our previous episode of the show.

323
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
That's hilarious.

324
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Even though I think you said the new ones weren't as cool as the old ones, I was kind of like, you know what?

325
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
It's still something you can do with this kid. And even if they already have domino rally, now they have more domino rally.

326
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
They don't have domino rally. Oh, good.

327
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
If they didn't have that, I was going to get crossfire.

328
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
What are these? There's stuff at the bottom.

329
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Oh, there's more. What's that? Oh, candy.

330
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Candy. Yay. Candy is always a good thing.

331
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I like candy.

332
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Fifth Dream says Dark Sakura got me something cool.

333
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Unfortunately, we can't get you a present, Fifth Dream. We don't have a way to get you a physical presence, but Dark Sakura, do you have any life advice for Fifth Dream?

334
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Don't suck.

335
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
There you go. Some free advice, Fifth Dream.

336
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
All right. So there's one more here.

337
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
All right. Here's, here goes gift number two.

338
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Legos.

339
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Legos. Of course. Of course we got them Legos.

340
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
All right. Woo.

341
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Of course we did. What kind of Legos? I don't even know what Legos.

342
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
So we got a brickhead Batman.

343
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Oh, you have the ones that look like the vinyl pop dolls.

344
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Yeah, like the pop dolls.

345
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Y'all know I love pop dolls.

346
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Flaco, you out there listening? You know I love me some pop dolls.

347
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:14,000
One of these giant, like, assorted Lego classic things with a bin to put stuff in.

348
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Something that will not limit your imagination.

349
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Awesome.

350
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
There we go.

351
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
We're going to have to put all that together and maybe Jamie can take a picture and put it on Twitter or something.

352
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Sure.

353
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
All right. I'm going to open this.

354
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
This is some, I like this wrapping.

355
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
There's some little teeny things in there too.

356
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Wait, is this an actual, oh, I thought this was wrapping.

357
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Oh my God. It's a crinkle cat tunnel.

358
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
So as if Mr. Smoosh didn't love paper bags more than anything, now he's going to have this tunnel.

359
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
And you can undo it in the middle to be a long tunnel.

360
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Oh boy. Oh boy. It's over now.

361
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
She's mentioned things for the cat and I was like, well, things for the cat are technically things for the daddies to watch the cat.

362
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Is this? Oh my God. Is this one of those? Oh, oh, oh my God. I was telling JD about this. This is one of those. Yes.

363
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Okay. JD, if you're out there listening, you know that pillow you have with the sequins where like, if you rub it down one side, it's one color and you rub it up the other, it's the other color.

364
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
So this one is, and hopefully some of you guys know what I'm talking about. This is a...

365
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
It's called a mermaid fin.

366
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Purple and silver, but it's a mermaid fin, like a Snuggie.

367
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I fucking love it. This is great.

368
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Well, you'll have to share it, but...

369
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
And now I can like rub down my body and change my mermaid colors.

370
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
But yeah, the whole bottom fin is that reversible sequin.

371
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I love it. No, ask JD. I sat there like all weekend, like rubbing the sequins on that pillow.

372
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Now you can rub your own sequins.

373
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Now I can rub my own sequins. There you go. I'm so happy. That's awesome.

374
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Dang, Jamie, you went all out.

375
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Well, it's for you and Alan.

376
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Some lanyards. This is good because if you know me and Dragon Con, I always fucking forget lanyards.

377
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
So I won't do that next time.

378
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
One for each of you. You can fight over if you want modern Mario or old school Mario.

379
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Well, obviously I'm taking old school Mario.

380
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
And then what's this? This is a...

381
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
For Mr. Smoosh. That was the thing. I almost told you what it was.

382
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
It's like, okay, it's a little skull and crossbones outfit.

383
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I pulled the tag off of it because it got broken.

384
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Okay, but that is...

385
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I'm gonna murder you.

386
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
I have one like that for Midna, but it's her leash.

387
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Jamie, there's too much here.

388
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
It's for you and Alan.

389
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
There's some candles.

390
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
They smell like amazingness.

391
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
And some candy. That's good.

392
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
And then what is this? A little...

393
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I got two of those. One for you.

394
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Unicorn keychains. And for those of you waiting for video game news, I promise we're getting there.

395
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
There's also a little teeny pin in there for you in particular.

396
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Oh, shoot. Little tea lights. That's good.

397
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
And there's a pin in there if you can find the pin.

398
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
It's small, so I hope it didn't get lost.

399
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Oh, yeah. I see it. It's way down here.

400
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Oh, it's a little enlightened.

401
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
I got that for you to go to events, Etsy.

402
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Oh, okay. Work.

403
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
So she actually found me an Ingress Enlightened pin. Thank you.

404
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
That's rad. I'm gonna put that on my hoodie that I just got.

405
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Well, you know, I've been kind of broke the last few years and you guys have done nice stuff for me.

406
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
So I kind of went all out this year.

407
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Thank you.

408
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I'm feeling the love here at OLR. You guys are too much. Thank you guys so much.

409
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Thank you guys. Marry whatever you celebrate here this December.

410
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
We call it Joomis at my house.

411
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Or just, you know, happy holidays. I guess it's the good old catch all.

412
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,000
But you know what I mean. Merry Christmas, happy Hanukkah, whatever it is you're into this time of year.

413
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Have a good one. And just, you know, thank you guys so much for being a part of OLR

414
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
and our continued, you know, growth over the last 15 years.

415
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
So, you know, we may not be the highest rated podcast out there.

416
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
But we have the most heart.

417
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Or apparently we're not the highest rated podcast in Sacramento either based on something I was seeing on Twitter this weekend.

418
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Is it about video games?

419
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I'm not gonna be shady.

420
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
What?

421
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
If it's not about video games it doesn't count.

422
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
No, of course the show's about video games.

423
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
That meant the other podcasts.

424
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Yes it is. I'll show you later.

425
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I don't know who you're talking about. Did you see the same thing I saw?

426
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
No, but I suspect.

427
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Oh, I see.

428
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Just based on the people I follow. But hey, you know what, it's fine.

429
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Yeah, it's fine.

430
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
They pimp themselves out more than we do.

431
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
As long as you're number one in your hearts. That's all we need.

432
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Better number one in your heart than number one in the toilet.

433
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Alright, let's move on.

434
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Let's talk about the Game Awards this week.

435
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:44,000
That was, hey, you know what, I know we've given these award shows a lot of shit over the years, and rightfully so to be quite honest, especially the years they were on Spike TV.

436
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
But I gotta give credit where credit is due. Now, I didn't see the whole thing. Disclaimer.

437
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I've been sick this week, so I kind of passed in and out and saw little bits and pieces.

438
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
But what I saw, I do have to admit, I was like, you know what, this really isn't turning out half bad.

439
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Sure, there's things they could do better.

440
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I don't like the whole, that they'll bring somebody up on stage and be like, they also won the award for best RPG and best, and kind of do that.

441
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I think what they should do, I understand it's only like a three hour show or something like that, right?

442
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,000
If they need to cut corners for time, what they need to do, they need to do it kind of like the Grammys do.

443
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:28,000
You know, have your opening, do maybe an award in the beginning, and then be like, let's take a look at some of the other categories that were given out before the show tonight.

444
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:34,000
And then just do a quick montage for like three minutes, covering the categories you're not going to do on TV.

445
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
And then, you did it! Huzzah! Huzzah! You did it!

446
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
And that way if you do the pre-production of all that, you won't forget anything either. Huzzah!

447
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
That would be my suggestion. But honestly, it could be a lot worse. And it has been a lot worse.

448
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,000
But some things that they did right, like I did see at the end when they had the orchestra playing all the stuff from the games of the year.

449
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:00,000
And they actually had the gal, was she lip syncing the Pauline stuff? Or was she actually the voice of Pauline doing that live?

450
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I don't know.

451
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I don't know. If she was the voice of Pauline doing that live, that was really impressive. I think she was doing it live.

452
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Or she's a good enough lip syncer to be on Drag Race, that's for sure.

453
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:20,000
So, I mean, I love that. I think we all like the video game orchestra stuff. It kind of brings more artsiness to our art form that we really enjoy.

454
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:27,000
So, you know, there's a lot of things that Game Awards are doing very well. So, you know, I don't want to always be negative here at OLR.

455
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
There are some, you know, good things amongst the, you know, challenges out there in the gaming industry.

456
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
But I think for the most part, they've come a long way. So anyway, big news came out of the Game Awards.

457
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:45,000
You know, Jeff Keeley, who puts this whole thing on, he's worked very hard to make this a, I don't want to say like a winner E3, but certainly like the must-see winner event.

458
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:54,000
And I would say, honestly, he took a lot of steam out of PSX, I think. A lot of these announcements could have been PSX, but they weren't.

459
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,000
So we'll get to PSX a little later though. But we had some announcements that came out of the Game Awards.

460
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Dark Soccer, you have a couple news items about the big, big, big stuff at the Game Awards, right?

461
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,000
A couple, yeah. Number one is Bayonetta 3, which is like, I'm glad I own a Switch now.

462
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Now look, this is a very overused term in the year 2017, but can I just say, YASS.

463
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Work. To Bayonetta 3. I was so, like I actually woke up from my medication induced coma.

464
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
I mean it's, to YASS, for Bayonetta 3, and then it was actually…

465
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
It's good that it's coming out. Yes. Yes.

466
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:38,720
but I feel it much like how you know it's in development the same as Metroid

467
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:43,680
Prime 4 is in development it's kind of like yeah I mean it's it's good but it's

468
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:47,160
like I wish there was something more concrete you know like this is coming

469
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:52,000
out next year yeah I'm coming out 2019 it's like it's in development and it'll

470
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,440
be coming out someday like Kingdom Hearts 3 someday that's coming out I

471
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:01,560
mean I just I guess it's it's reassuring that at least it's coming out and it's

472
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,600
exclusive to Nintendo so that's kind of cool yeah well you know and when people

473
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,520
are thinking about do I get a switch or not and don't forget they also had the

474
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:12,920
announcement about Bayonetta so they did have a day for that Bayonetta 1 and 2

475
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:17,760
are coming out for switch in February so that's awesome I'm so happy that

476
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,840
Bayonetta 2 is getting a second life and a second chance on a console that more

477
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:24,200
people are buying because that's cool you know that was one of the best games

478
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:29,080
on the Wii U and I think a lot of people really really missed it so it really is

479
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:34,440
the best Christmas video game too if you think about the opening of the the game

480
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:38,160
but anyway so I'm very excited about Bayonetta can I quickly mention though I

481
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,320
know you have another thing to mention but I just want to quickly because I

482
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,640
know it's not what you're gonna talk about but when you talk about the whole

483
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:47,480
like announcement leading into years of hype and so forth this is a challenging

484
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:51,240
place that I'm kind of at I'm kind of at with Death Stranding okay so one of the

485
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:54,360
other things they brought to the Game Awards was the a new Death Stranding

486
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:58,760
trailer right where it's like okay Kojima's Empreg Fantasy what is it

487
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:04,360
oh so mysterious much Wow you know that whole thing but but with with Death

488
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:07,520
Stranding like I'm kind of hitting that point and I think I wrote a very sassy

489
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:12,440
tweet about this that some people wanted to fight me on and I said okay do you

490
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:16,040
know what other game had years and years of hype and we didn't see a single bit

491
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:20,040
of gameplay footage yeah it was called No Man's Sky just think about that for a

492
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:25,360
little bit now look and then well Kojima bla bla bla doesn't do bad games

493
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:31,320
look look look I get it I get it but my point is I'm just I I would just like a

494
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:35,720
little something it's been a few years so I just like to see maybe a little bit

495
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:39,020
of game a little hint about what the fuck this is they did some stuff the

496
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:42,080
same type of thing though with like some of the Metal Gear Solid games as well

497
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:46,760
and eventually I'm guessing probably by e3 we should have gameplay I would think

498
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,880
because that's what they kind of do with Metal Gear Solid remember Metal Gear

499
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:55,840
Solid he went all crazy with like oh hey I'm not really Kojima I'm Joe Kim

500
00:35:55,840 --> 00:36:00,800
something or other and I'm the Swedish guy and I'm wearing a full face like

501
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:05,040
bandage thing and I have this game coming out called you know I remember

502
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:09,480
the healthy we're calling it fan of pain the fan of pain it's not Metal Gear even

503
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:14,200
though it's like that's Metal Gear and then like you know they eventually like

504
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:18,920
ah it's me Kojima and if they don't lose weird shit that drag on for like a few

505
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:24,560
years so this is kind of his mo already and and let's put it this way like this

506
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:28,520
new trailer I still I have fucking no idea what the fuck this thing is about

507
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:34,520
like it's just weird and creepy and I'm confused and what's this gonna play like

508
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:39,720
I have no idea okay yeah I'm gonna say with Death Stranding look I'm sure it'll

509
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:45,360
be fine you know Kojima is great if this is what PT has turned into then

510
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:49,320
fucking you know PT was fucking if you think about it kind of like Silent Hill

511
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:53,080
where you'd have everything kind of melt into whatever yeah it's sort of like

512
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:56,880
that with the tar stuff so look I look I'm not I'm not saying like I'm gonna

513
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:01,920
hate on it or I'm not gonna buy it all I'm saying is okay I'm a little done

514
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:06,360
with the hype machine next time let's let's see some gay but what is the game

515
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:11,400
though that's where I'm at what is the game though that's it if you swallowed a

516
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:18,440
baby and there's a baby inside in and the baby winked at me give me a thumbs

517
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:22,880
up I know some people that swallow babies on a pretty regular basis anyway

518
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:30,880
Oh Jamie you had some other news I was just watching the Capcom Cup winner yeah

519
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,960
but that that that baby though and there is kind of like you know the myth like

520
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:38,320
if you swallow a watermelon seeds gonna grow in your stomach well how bullshit

521
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,420
your stomach is acidic I know well anyway I know some people that are in

522
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:47,960
trouble DLC for the Legend of Zelda breath of the

523
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:57,880
wild the champions ballad DLC pack 2 is I believe out already and looking things

524
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:02,880
over on it the biggest thing about this is that link gets a motorbike called the

525
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:12,440
master cycle zero and it also will let you explore differently we haven't

526
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:20,520
downloaded it yet but what we will be master cycle 0 f 0 f 0 switch confirmed

527
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:29,080
girl I'm trying you're reaching for it I'm trying so but yeah news news all the

528
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:32,760
stuff maybe it'll be in development someday if they put out enough Pikmin

529
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:37,720
games yeah I want them to do like a DLC that's the rebuilding Hyrule where you

530
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:42,440
wander around with Zelda or you could wander around as Zelda well breath of

531
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:46,840
the wild as we all know one game of the year at this point at the Game Awards

532
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:51,920
which you know I it's it's hard to say it's not well deserved I was surprised I

533
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,960
thought audience see we get it yeah purse it's tough though because it's

534
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:00,640
like I can see here personally I would have picked Mario Odyssey but at the

535
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:06,420
same time it's like but like is breath of the wild a bad game at all in any way

536
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:12,320
whatsoever though no were any of those games not really so it's like I think

537
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,600
you would kind of have to be satisfied with any of the winners but there is I

538
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:22,360
will say this it is nice and it is a good thing to see Nintendo win it for a

539
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:26,920
change on a game developed for Wii U nonetheless there is something very much

540
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:31,120
like cheering for the underdog sort of thing that you do get a okay that's

541
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:35,160
that's a happy ending sort of thing out of that yeah I mean so I think the

542
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:39,080
other thing that's really good with this particular DLC is that it's about the

543
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:42,960
the four champions hmm so I think that'll be cool to learn more about them

544
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:48,240
yeah that'll be fun all right so anything else about the Game Awards you

545
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,400
guys want to say actually there's a couple other little announcements we

546
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,160
should probably mention they came out of Game Awards so caliber six is the

547
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:56,600
biggest one on my mind that they showed the trailer show too much of that well

548
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:04,560
they showed what it was Sofia and one of the other guys he's like the main guy

549
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,680
yeah I think they were fighting each other and that was that was kind of the

550
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,680
gist of it but they didn't yeah we don't know what like if there's character

551
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:14,960
customization again or who the guest characters are anything like that I like

552
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,720
well the announcements they had a lot of VR announcements which was kind of cool

553
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:23,560
so accounting is one that I'm looking forward to that's just really fucked up

554
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:26,760
it's done by the guys is Rick and Morty and they're actually doing in it as

555
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:32,920
another game as well but counting plus they've added more stuff to it and then

556
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:38,400
they announced the sequel to job simulator which is vacation simulator

557
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,840
which looks alright I'll definitely pick that up cuz I like the first one well

558
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,520
you just answered come on no Gus's question in chat are you gonna get

559
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:51,080
vacation simulator yeah I'll get it I'll get away comes out but those are

560
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:57,120
kind of neat and then they showed off a trailer for dream remember how like they

561
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:00,480
always have those like weird tech demos that media molecule was just hoeing off

562
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,720
yeah it's like finally get what they were trying to do with that it's like

563
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:08,880
fucking little big planet just amped up yeah a little bit a little big universe

564
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,280
yeah it's just ridiculous so I still don't know what the gameplay is gonna be

565
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:15,920
like but it looks like you can just well I'm not sure there is they'll

566
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,440
probably be some type of campaign adventure mode but maybe the sandbox is

567
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,880
the game kind of like a little big planet was kind of yeah yeah so I mean

568
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:27,840
I'm kind of interested you get to make your dream all the olr dream games come

569
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:31,100
true but I don't know if that games VR because they had some shots in there

570
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:34,720
that made it look like it could be VR but I don't know if it is I know it had

571
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:40,860
like move controller support but I don't know if it's like a VR game be cool to

572
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:49,020
see though maybe it can maybe it's optional hmm all right some breaking

573
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:52,700
news coming in our chat room oh shit sorry I dropped my phone some breaking

574
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:55,780
news coming in our chat room over at live dot vog network calm I guess Capcom

575
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:59,380
Cup is wrapping up and I think about an hour ago I should say this they did

576
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:03,340
announce that there is a Street Fighter collection coming out on PlayStation 4

577
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:06,580
so it is a Street Fighter 30th anniversary collection and it's

578
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:11,460
basically like every Street Fighter through like one two and three and every

579
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:18,140
like you know hyper two and all the other stuff and alpha is in there as

580
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:21,780
well so that's pretty rad so that's a real that sounds like it's gonna be a

581
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:25,740
really good collection they've only confirmed PlayStation because PSX is

582
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:29,140
going on right now I would hope they think about doing the switch but

583
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:32,700
considering they just put a $40 Street Fighter 2 remake on the switch maybe not

584
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:37,300
I don't know and then they are saying there in our chat over at live dot vog

585

00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:55,460
Final Fight I think is what they're saying there is who's being announced

589
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:59,860
right now as our show is going on here on this Sunday evening live at the voice

592
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:14,700
that's exciting that's great those people have paid $40 for the I mean I

593
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:18,780
unless you really wanted that first-person fireball mode or and also

594
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:22,660
the extra characters that they created that were totally unique evil was it

595
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:26,940
evil right you and you know perturbed can or whatever it was I don't remember

Oh act F says they're announcing all of season three so it's Sakura Cody Blanca

Sagat and two others G and Falk are the other two so there it's all season three

598
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:45,780
characters well that's cool G as in Eddie Murphy's character meeting G over

599
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:50,500
there I don't think no I don't know probably just a new character I think

600
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:53,180
unfortunately I don't have the video in front of me so I'm relying on our

601
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:56,620
chatters to kind of fill me in on what's going on there but that's that's the

602
00:43:56,620 --> 00:44:01,260
breaking news going on right now out of PSX we'll talk a little bit as well

603
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:04,500
about PSX we're gonna get into that in the news but first let's talk about our

604
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:07,940
gaming weeks the types of video games we've been playing this week Dark Sakura

605
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:12,860
how was your gaming week it was all right I've had a busy week so I have

606
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:26,340
been playing with I guess Pokemon go and Animal Crossing I'm almost level 42 and

607
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:33,420
ingress I just haven't really been doing a whole lot we've been playing

608
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:39,060
through Super Mario Odyssey a bit more and that's really about it right now at

609
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:43,140
my house okay so not a whole lot not a whole lot

610
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:47,040
Loki how about you how's your gaming week I'm sadly not as in-depth as I

611
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:50,100
would have hoped it would have been but I did play more of the Lego Marvel

612
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:53,760
superheroes to thing just kind of unlocking more characters for my kids to

613
00:44:53,760 --> 00:45:01,880
play and then I played a little bit of ingress a little bit Pokemon go and a

614
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:06,800
little bit of the office space game although I kind of took a break from

615
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,080
the office space game for a little bit cuz it's just I was getting really

616
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:14,600
annoyed and just kind of the same stuff over and over again so I I don't know if

617
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:18,700
I'll go back to that or not I heard that endless Katamari game you used to play

618
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:23,540
and got me into for a little bit like finally came out for Android so I

619
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:27,660
thought I heard that amazing Katamari or something it's been out for Android I

620
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:30,500
had it for Android really I thought it I thought I was reading something just

621
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:33,300
today that like it just came out was there maybe a second Katamari game or

622
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:37,060
something oh is there a second Katamari game I mean at the big play that you

623
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:40,860
know tap my Katamari was oh wait no it's not tap my Katamari it was called

624
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:43,860
something else so maybe it is a new Katamari you know that I'll never was

625
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:50,620
tap my Katamari I'm looking it's there's a game called amazing Katamari

626
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:56,460
Damacy oh no this is not the same game this is a different runner game okay

627
00:45:56,460 --> 00:46:01,540
fifth dream says there's a runner and a clicker game so tap my Katamari is the

628
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:05,540
clicker game amazing Katamari is the runner so the runner game just came out

629
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:10,340
for there you go I'll check that out sorry I don't know why I thought of the

630
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:13,660
other one but I just I knew that that was a game year didn't you were into for

631
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:18,500
a hot minute so it was all right yeah I just got to like demanding like grinding

632
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:23,900
and I just said no forget it I don't want to play this anymore hmm so yeah I

633
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:28,780
haven't I haven't played that and I don't know that's pretty much it my wife

634
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:32,900
got in the candy crush and I you know I shook my finger at her I'm like you

635
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:37,020
can't support that game that game is evil don't play that game the company's

636
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:40,820
just shit and she's like I don't get it like I played this game and I ran out I

637
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:45,100
ran out of attempts to play the level I had to wait for the cooldown I'm like

638
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:49,820
it's shit don't play it connect her with Rama I don't know if Rama still plays

639
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:53,420
that but maybe they can send each other lives or something I don't even know how

640
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:56,740
it works I don't even know if he's still play I just totally threw him out there

641
00:46:56,740 --> 00:47:01,740
remember who are the people I knew that like that game so she's playing that and

642
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:06,860
then really it's like gaming which which Rama says in chat well it's not like

643
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:11,820
she's watching the game show thank God no we're not doing that but she did

644
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:16,180
finish friends so now she's up on to fuck I don't know what other shows she's

645
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:20,460
watching now and Rama also says I haven't played candy crush in years well

646
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:27,740
you know what Rama you did way to kick the habit you did um so yeah so she was

647
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:33,740
playing that I don't know like so I did watch the ready player one new trailer

648
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:38,340
today about a dozen I wondered when this was gonna come up dozen times it's

649
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:42,820
fucking awesome Battletoads are fucking in it yeah tracer I saw tracer lean yeah

650
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:46,580
all the characters it's still now see I never read the book so I still watch it

651
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:49,280
and I go this doesn't make sense to me but I have the book it seems like a

652
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:54,260
nostalgia orgy is what's going on here it isn't a soldier orgy okay

653
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:58,180
at least we've known you the book it's it's pretty good it's it's pretty dumb

654
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:06,180
but it's it's um it's fun Bobby Black Wolf and Chad says tracers not 80s well

655
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:10,940
not all the characters are 80s it you know a lot of the people had stuff

656
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:17,360
that's based off of 80s characters but you know not everybody necessarily had

657
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:21,780
avatars that were from the 80s it's just a lot of people were into that and so

658
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:25,420
that's what they made their avatars look like or they're more nostalgic about it

659
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:30,620
anything they've also said don't expect the movie to mirror the book it's gonna

660
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:34,420
be different having read the leaked script and based off the trailers it

661
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:38,300
seems to be following that it's not entirely based off of the book it's

662
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:43,900
falls the same kind of plot points but there are changes like some of the

663
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:47,060
different challenge or trials are different but I mean that makes sense

664
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:51,880
because like in the book the first trial was basically watching someone play a

665
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:56,960
joust game it's like that's not that exciting to watch on TV whereas an

666
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:02,080
extreme like racing thing with you know shit exploding and all these cars

667
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:07,520
everywhere that's more exciting right and I'm fine at that you know so it's

668
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:11,680
gonna be great I can't wait I'm already gonna put in my time off at work so I

669
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:16,240
can see that that's what a lot of people are doing this weekend for the war of

670
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:23,320
stars yes I'm right along with this big and then just because I don't want

671
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:28,280
spoilers and so I will see that I saw some fucking I saw like a Facebook ad

672
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:32,800
that was like basically like it was a it was an ad for the movie that was

673
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:39,560
basically like see it before it spoiled it's like fuck you like it was like an

674
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:44,000
official ad that was like see the movie before something asshole spoils it for

675
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,840
you I'm worried that someone will spoil it for me so thankfully they have shows

676
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:52,160
locally starting at 9 a.m. so somebody else I know on Facebook was like I'm

677
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:56,560
going to the 9 a.m. showing so the crowd won't it so that it won't be full I'm

678
00:49:56,560 --> 00:50:01,240
gonna yell I'm gonna try to make it but like this is my day off to basically see

679
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:06,400
all the movies I've missed so I'm gonna see that for Ragnarok I'm not sure what

680
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:10,040
else is out that I want to see but I'm gonna see a couple movies and just to

681
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:14,240
catch up I want to see Lady Bird it's always I want to see how my city is

682
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:18,160
represented on the big screen because I imagine it's probably Lady Bird not

683
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:21,880
totally fly yeah oh yeah have you not heard of that that's like the movie that

684
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:26,120
is has all the Oscar hype around it you know because all the critics love it but

685
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:29,320
it was like made here in sack where our shows but Sacramento where we're based

686
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:34,000
it's like some of the landmarks you see it's like when you see the shot of the

687
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,280
Tower Bridge that's in the trailer I'm like oh I know exactly where that is

688
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:41,840
because I've played Pokemon go there a ton of times there I am in the back I

689
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:44,920
know as we're walking from Crocker to Old Town it's like we walk right by that

690
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:48,640
spot I'm like that's where all the homeless people hang out and it smells

691
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:52,680
kind of like urine all the time so I'm like that must have been interesting

692
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:58,440
when they made a movie there so just there was a thought I had when I saw the

693
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:03,120
trailer I was like romantic things don't usually happen in that spot actually but

694
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:09,840
such as movie magic I suppose I find your must so attractive that's not me

695
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:14,960
as Jonah Matt says Lady Bird is the apparently the highest rated movie most

696
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:19,040
certified fresh reviews on Rotten Tomatoes of all time I had heard that

697
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:22,640
too well then I have to not see it because I don't know what the hell it is

698
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:28,380
I think I don't know it might be is it about is it I think it's a girl coming

699
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:31,240
of age film so I don't know oh I thought it might have been about King of the

700
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:34,800
Hills you know I don't know wife wants to see it I bet your wife one it's

701
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:38,400
probably something your wife wants to see dark soccer have you heard of this

702
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:44,120
movie at all yeah yeah are you feeling it or no I kind of want to see it for

703
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:47,760
the Sacramento stuff and I do love Laurie Metcalfe I don't like going to

704
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:52,240
many movies it's it's not about Roseanne my childhood what not about Hank Hill's

705
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:58,320
dog it is not about Hank Hill's fucking dog all right anyway act F says it's a

706
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:04,160
slice-of-life movie there you go anyway that's about pizza sweet no all right

707
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:09,600
Mikey me week oh hi my video game week I well as you can hear I'm recovering from

708
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:13,680
a cold so I didn't play a lot of video games this week honestly I know it's

709
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:16,440
usually like oh if you're sick you just stay home and play video games all day

710
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:19,440
but no I really just wanted to stay home and sleep and then I didn't really have

711
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:24,080
the energy for video games but I did play an unhealthy amount of World of

712
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:28,240
Warcraft there was that I'm up to like on the character I started just a couple

713
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:32,840
weeks ago I'm up to level 97 now I think I just hit so there's that and

714
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:39,760
then let's see besides that I did play a couple new games on Nintendo switch the

715
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:45,240
one I'll mention is I started playing Xenoblade Chronicles 2 and even though

716
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,720
this isn't gonna make me the most popular person in the world I'm gonna

717
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:52,960
confess I can't I'm not getting into it like I started playing Xenoblade

718
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:57,640
Chronicles 2 and I just wasn't really grabbed by the story and the games don't

719
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:00,200
really have anything to do with each other right it's like Final Fantasy

720
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:04,240
right I because I didn't recognize any of the people in it I think I think

721
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:08,360
they're like separate stories but I tried playing through you know I was

722
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:11,720
doing some of the first few quests in the first area and I was like I'm not

723
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:18,120
I'm not feeling this I just I wasn't grabbed the same way that on Wii U

724
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:21,940
Xenoblade Chronicles X or whatever was on Wii U I just not grabbed the same way I

725
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:27,200
was with that game so that's my honest opinion I'll probably try to give it a

726
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:31,920
little more time and to be fair again I've been sick so I don't really have

727
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,880
the attention span for a lot right now so maybe I just didn't really give this

728
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:39,200
game a fair shot but yeah after playing it for and I've probably put a couple

729
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:42,440
hours into it I'm just I'm not really super feeling it like I'm not really

730
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:48,520
motivated to go play more so yeah dungeon buster in chat says XC2 has

731
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:52,560
nothing to do with the first one but it shares some concepts so okay so that's

732
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:56,280
that's a fair way to describe Final Fantasy games too I'm a dungeon buster

733
00:53:56,320 --> 00:54:01,320
also says I like XC2 but it's not exactly blowing me away either okay well

734
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:04,960
I'm glad I'm not like totally being a negative Nancy with that then I just I

735
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:09,320
don't know it's just not grabbing me but maybe if if you're a super RPG fan maybe

736
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:13,760
there's gonna be here more here for you it is portable the text is really big

737
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,560
the interface looks a lot different so that like portable you can actually

738
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:21,000
reach it so you know that's all pretty cool but I just I'm not I haven't really

739
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:26,200
been grabbed by the game like I was with XCX so anyway so that was my gaming week

740
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:31,880
so some housekeeping real quick we will be here next week but then we will be

741
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:34,760
off for two Sundays we're not gonna be here Christmas Eve we're not gonna be

742
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:38,640
here New Year's Eve however I will be talking with the co-hosts about maybe we

743
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:42,360
can tape something at a different time so we're just not gonna be in our normal

744
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:45,640
live slot but I'm hoping we can still deliver something into the podcast feed

745
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:49,240
at least at least one of those weeks like a holiday special thing or

746
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:52,760
something we'll do while we're gone but unfortunately with the eaves falling on

747
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:55,920
Sundays this year it's gonna be really hard for us to be live especially like

748
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:58,760
an early show or something yeah maybe maybe especially I'll check in with you

749
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:02,080
guys for like New Year's New Year's plans like Christmas I can't even do an

750
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:05,120
early or Christmas Eve I can't even do an early show yeah but New Year's Eve

751
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:08,960
that's a possibility for sure so we'll I'll check your guys's schedule and so

752
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:14,120
forth so so that'll be that so those of you that come here live and listen on

753
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:17,400
Sunday nights we'll be here next week but then you're not gonna find us here

754
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:20,680
same bat time say bat channel for a couple weeks so I just want to warn you

755
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:25,680
guys now as Joe and Matt says will you do a special with your games of the year

756
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:29,960
probably that'll probably be do some something we do in that show I do time

757
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:33,640
capsule yeah and the time capsule maybe they'll be next year so yeah me well no

758
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:37,120
not next week well we'll save that and the so that way you guys have a reason

759
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:41,280
and motivation to go listen to the special show so we'll do that I'm

760
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:44,920
thinking an early taping will be good it's everybody fucking wants to know

761
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:48,320
about the time caps I can leave for go it's in there I mean I could here's the

762
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:52,720
miracle you could do I believe the shows in our archive you could go back to like

763
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:56,000
episode I think like 430 or something right now in our archive and then if you

764
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,680
want even further back just ask dark Tetsuya he has a little key to the vault

765
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:03,120
that has like episode 1 if you really want to hear it even though it's it's

766
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:07,160
it's hard for me to listen to episode 1 now it's pretty bad but anyway you know

767
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:12,460
you live you learn you grow but anyway we could just go back and listen to the

768
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:15,600
episode in June when we did it but that's the funny thing is that you know

769
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:19,800
with the gamer attention span we knew we weren't gonna remember that far back so

770
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:22,400
I don't remember what I said I know I don't remember what I said I have no

771
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,840
fucking idea what's in that thing just a little slips of paper it's probably just

772
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:30,320
gonna be like Jamie hand wrote things like give me a dollar and flaffle she

773
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:39,960
just wrote us do you like falafel anyway all right but we will I can already tell

774
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:44,840
you the time capsule will return in 2018 but it will be a proper time capsule so

775
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:50,480
that will be something we will do live on January 6th or 7th or whatever the

776
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:57,880
Sunday is the first show back so please look forward to it all right mmm as to

777
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:02,000
100 Matt says probably pictures of crudely drawn dicks and boobs probably

778
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,280
probably all right let's get into some gaming news it was actually a very busy

779
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:09,520
week because we had the game awards and we had other stuff right it's all this

780
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:13,400
like stuff that you just didn't even know that was there and all sudden yeah

781
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:20,840
so there was some announcements made at PSX which had its opening night just a

782
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:27,960
couple days ago so some cool additions one is which in knock I don't know how

783
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:33,400
vomit inducing this is gonna be but wipeout Omega collection is getting a VR

784
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:40,680
mode so that'll be intense I'm sure so look forward to that that sounds

785
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:43,920
completely unhealthy but I'm actually kind of into it I think wasn't that one

786
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:50,160
of the free games that they gave out with was wipeout omega free I bought it

787
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:53,640
I have the blu-ray so huh yeah I don't know if they gave I don't know if there

788
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:57,680
was a PlayStation Plus game or not but I feel like they gave away one of the

789
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:02,320
games that's remade in the collection they gave away a little maybe like on

790
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:07,100
PlayStation 3 but I don't think they gave away the collection yet okay well

791
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:11,180
noise God of War they're saying though that apparently the game is gonna be

792
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:15,940
quite long whereas the previous God of War games were bent about like 10 hours

793
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:20,780
long this one's gonna be 35 to 40 hours long which considering it's a linear

794
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:27,980
game that's that's a pretty long game so interesting they were saying that

795
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:33,620
talking a little bit about Detroit become human I guess you can ask about

796
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:40,380
they said emotional shocks so they were talking about how I guess why do I need

797
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:45,100
those from a video game when 2017 has been delivering to me in real life on a

798
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:49,180
regular basis I don't need any more emotional shocks thank you very much

799
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:57,140
yeah so there's I don't know it looks interesting talking about it you know

800
00:58:57,140 --> 00:59:00,980
it's pretty much like the other other games that they've made MXC and chat

801
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:04,460
over at live.vognetwork.com about wipeout said surprisingly not that

802
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:08,540
vomit inducing and I'm not particularly great with VR but it's absolutely

803
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:13,320
intense okay how do you know that MXC were you at PSX this weekend or did they

804
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:17,660
do a demo on ps4 or something when I wasn't looking did he go do that they do

805
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:20,540
the live theater experience thing or something like that because I don't

806
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:25,360
know they have they didn't have like a keynote Oh MXC says oh yes I did go to

807
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:30,380
PSX oh that's great I hope you call in later I'd love to hear more many evils

808
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:35,540
getting remastered for PlayStation 4 so that's how that's pretty cool they're

809
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:42,340
gonna do a VR standalone experience for The Last Guardian which I guess they're

810
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:46,980
saying that's coming out as a demo um actually in a couple days to December

811
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:53,120
12th Monster Hunter world is gonna feature Megaman in there which looks

812
00:59:53,120 --> 01:00:01,680
kind of weird but okay it's like a pixelated 3d 8-bit Megaman but not I

813
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:05,520
don't know they're saying that maybe in the future that you'll be able to change

814
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:10,480
your PlayStation Network name so that might be something that's coming soon

815
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:14,880
but this is really fucking hard for Sony to do isn't it

816
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:19,360
apparently I guess like you know it's like they're trying to invent the cure

817
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:22,940
for a disease over there to change your fucking name on PlayStation Network my

818
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:27,880
god yeah and that's pretty much it right now as far as like some of the

819
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:32,300
announcements that they have like during the first day so interesting yeah it

820
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:35,500
sounds like it sounds like the event this year was was a little different

821
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:38,540
from other years especially you know they didn't really have that bang-up

822
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:41,460
announcement thing that they did yeah there was kind of like we're just gonna

823
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:45,700
smoke pot and chill here on Friday night like I actually watched a little bit of

824
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:51,100
that and I was kind of like basically they were doing a podcast but on stage

825
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:54,940
with hundreds and hundreds of their friends I'm surprised well I'm not

826
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:59,580
surprised I'm disappointed I should say that they didn't have any announcements

827
01:00:59,580 --> 01:01:05,300
regarding backwards compatibility oh and they set it up for that too like one of

828
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:07,900
the guys there was a Shawn Layden I'd actually kind of set up for that like

829
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:12,180
it's not like you can go into a store and go get a PSX or something like that

830
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:16,740
and the whole audience is like yes yes yes I'm gonna I'm gonna and then he's

831
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:19,500
like and that's why we're remastering medieval and you just hear the whole

832
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:24,620
like polite golf clapping in the audience like yay we get to buy it again

833
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:32,900
yeah it's I don't know I kind of disappointed I just wish that they would

834
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:37,620
do something about it I would have liked to gone to PSX I wish the year had been

835
01:01:37,620 --> 01:01:42,540
kinder to me so I had more vacation time to do that but maybe maybe next year

836
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:46,940
just was in the cards for me this year but then next year I have to debate if

837
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:51,700
I'm gonna go to Final Fantasy fan fest or maybe even Blizzcon like so many

838
01:01:51,700 --> 01:02:00,100
conventions so little time the struggle the struggle anyway I'm sorry I can't

839
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:06,220
stop watching the Sakura trailer oh how she look she looks really good but this

840
01:02:06,220 --> 01:02:10,100
is what's a neat touch is that you know how normally when one of the characters

841
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:14,080
does something that you know they put their key into it's either charge blue

842
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:18,600
or something hers are all pink with cherry blossoms can I just point out

843
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:22,660
here in this moment we're talking positively about Street Fighter 5 here

844
01:02:22,660 --> 01:02:26,600
at orange ons radio just note that down to the right time I fucking love her

845
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:31,060
outfit and I might have to do that outfit I haven't anything about Street

846
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:36,880
Fighter 5 maybe this is a great Diablo I have no I have no interest in Street

847
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:43,880
Fighter 5 oh my god in the background here is like her backyard with her

848
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:47,640
little brother playing video games again mm-hmm that's awesome that just

849
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:51,520
makes me super happy inside well this is gonna make a lot of people happy and

850
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:54,600
it's one of those things where I would say it's kind of obvious but it's nice

851
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:59,520
to have the confirmation especially when the developers were moving on to another

852
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:05,440
big game out of the Marvel Universe Square Enix did confirm that a new Tomb

853
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:10,680
Raider game is happening but they didn't say anything else it was not featured at

854
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:14,880
the Game Awards it was not featured at PlayStation experience little weird that

855
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:17,880
they kind of just announced this on Twitter with kind of like an open letter

856
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:22,640
but perhaps I'm gonna speculate maybe originally they were going to announce

857
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:26,840
it at one of these events something happened schedule got pushed back a bit

858
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:31,560
and so they decided now is not the time to do it but for whatever reason they

859
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:34,880
didn't announce it with a big trailer or anything but they did confirm we're

860
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:39,200
working on it so there will be a third Tomb Raider game by the way remember

861
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:43,040
that we saw the name shadow of the Tomb Raider I think trademarked or something

862
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:47,080
not that long ago so it's very possible that's the name but of course if they

863
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:50,960
want to change it who knows their statement said Square Enix is excited to

864
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:54,320
share some big news with you next year honestly we wish we could share it with

865
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:59,000
you right now but we're taking a new approach this time driven by our goal of

866
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,520
putting our fans first we want you to know that it won't be very long between

867
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:08,640
the official reveal and when you can play that's also a very interesting that

868
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:13,360
has me concerned because we did that we did see a trailer during the whole Game

869
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:19,280
Awards called shadows died twice so I don't think Loki you're reaching you

870
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:23,560
know you're reaching this is this isn't fucking Kojima Swedish developer Phantom

871
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:27,480
Payne shit okay it's not there's no reason for the Tomb Raider folks gonna

872
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:34,040
have twice as bad of a day no it's three times three times three times that

873
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:41,160
third times not the charm for Lara Croft as she gets eaten by a bear Lara Croft

874
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:44,840
in the no good horrible very bad day our journey together will begin with a major

875
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:50,080
event in 2018 we simply can't wait to take you on Lara Croft's defining

876
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:54,640
adventure that makes it sound a little final doesn't it I don't know it's just

877
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:57,360
hype well do you think maybe here's another thought do you think maybe

878
01:04:57,360 --> 01:05:01,240
there's a tie-in for the movie do you think oh they're gonna hope not maybe

879
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:05,640
they're gonna show the trailer for the game with the movie and then the game is

880
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:09,400
gonna be out that fall that would be an interesting way to do it in my right in

881
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:13,760
the game I don't think they're rushing the game it's been what rise to the Tomb

882
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:21,280
Raider was like last year on no I think it was like two years ago I was two

883
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:24,760
years ago because they have the stupid time exclusive so if it's next year I

884
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:28,840
mean honestly they've had a good three years to do it now granted assuming

885
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:34,160
crystal we don't really have crystal dynamics that are they are is critical

886
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:37,480
dynamics doing this game because they might not be because they've got the

887
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:42,200
Marvel game they're working on right um yeah and so this Tomb Raider game may be

888
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:47,280
coming from elsewhere Tomb Raider was highly featured in the trailer today for

889
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:53,120
Ready Player One several times oh actually I'm I'm reading that Eidos

890
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:58,280
Montreal is apparently making this new game that's already that's the studio

891
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:04,680
that's hit man mmm I don't remember yeah one of them does that so be

892
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:07,600
interesting to me it could be a very different type of Tomb Raider game too

893
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:13,680
so anyway you mean she won't die horribly all these times she'll be

894
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:19,480
fluent in French and English all right anyway moving on Dark Sakura other

895
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:24,040
there's considering we're in fucking December is actually very busy gaming

896
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:29,400
Newsweek mobile games no exception right Jamie indeed a Niantic is bringing

897
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:34,540
out the third generation of a Pokemon and this time they're gonna be affected

898
01:06:34,540 --> 01:06:40,200
by weather so it will I guess work in conjunction with local weather so that

899
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:44,680
you'll get certain Pokemon that are available like in the rain or the snow

900
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:49,440
or bright sunshine are we're gonna get a lot of fucking desert types or something

901
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:55,240
no it's fire grass and earth type it's already been brought in they launched on

902
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:58,840
Friday so yeah if you bring up your game you can actually see it right now I

903
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:03,560
don't know what the weather is I just caught a whirlpool on the house it was

904
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:07,440
some of the gentry stuffs here it was sunny I hadn't seen any of them today

905
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:12,760
but then again my my I had to get a new SIM card I just upgraded my phone I got

906
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:17,400
an iPhone 10 I have seen it switch from sunny to cloudy right now it's night oh

907
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:22,760
yeah there's that's the C dots evolution yeah Nuzleaf on the house right now so

908
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:29,040
yes everybody has their phone trying to catch the Nuzleaf he's an ugly little

909
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:36,240
fuck yeah but that's a lot of candy I think you need like a hundred to evolve

910
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:42,720
Nuzleaf into the third form there so I love it everybody brought up Pokemon go

911
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:46,320
here in studio and everybody's catching the fucking Nuzleaf on the house right

912
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:50,280
now it's so interesting that they did put the details of nipples on the

913
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:53,760
Nuzleaf as well yeah well it's like Mario necessary it's like Mario it's

914
01:07:53,760 --> 01:08:02,360
Nipley anyway oh my god it's a wonder where if you appraise it it's the

915
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:08,080
highest appraisal oh that's awesome maybe that's just for you no oh if you

916
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:13,800
have to be at least level 30 to get the same I think Pokemon 29 don't yeah mine

917
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:19,240
appraised at the highest level 27 don't I'm a sit in a row but that was 37

918
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:24,200
anyway yeah JD points out that it makes certain types of moves more powerful

919
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:29,080
yeah and the raids it affects the raids so usually when you catch a Pokemon at a

920
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:33,760
raid I think you catch it at level 30 question mark but now you can catch it

921
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:37,720
up to like level 35 no I think you catch the Pokemon level 20 from a raid but the

922
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:44,360
weather bonuses add five levels so like you can catch ho ho is what I call him I

923
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:48,520
think he's ho oh but I call him a ho ho because well you know where that name

924
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:53,680
comes from no I don't it's a word for Phoenix okay well that makes sense

925
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:57,280
especially considering the design but it's Christmas so I call him ho ho so I

926
01:08:57,280 --> 01:09:01,200
did catch a ho ho but apparently people are catching hoes that like the CP is

927
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:04,560
through the roof because they're five levels higher during the right kind of

928
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:12,160
weather so I III is impressive at least e3 vl or evil in our chat room over at

929
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:16,200
live dog network comm says I quit because of that I could take out gyms on

930
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:21,320
my own and not raid battles no discord around me have to travel 15 miles not

931
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:25,940
worth it in my opinion yeah that's a bummer the the more rural folks have a

932
01:09:25,940 --> 01:09:30,280
real problem trying to do like you know trying to get right now absol from gen

933
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:35,080
3 is like a four star raid evils not gonna be able to do that himself unless

934
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:39,160
he can get a party of like seven people and that's led to people wanting to

935
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:42,520
multi-account and do all that stuff so they you know so they can enjoy the the

936
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:47,680
whole game and that's kind of Nantic needs to think about maybe flexing how

937
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:52,880
strong like at least make it so you can capture a week week week one by yourself

938
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:56,080
and then maybe have to just go through the process of leveling it up or

939
01:09:56,080 --> 01:10:00,880
something I wish Niantic would revisit that somehow so yeah I wish we could

940
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:06,560
grind up one Pokemon for candy for another Pokemon wouldn't that be nice it

941
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:09,880
would be or at least like reduce did you want to mention the other piece on the

942
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:15,840
weather to Jimmy well yeah um well I did mention that the weather affects what

943
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:20,200
you can catch and how it catches right and that it you know like you brought up

944
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:25,000
it will bring up different advantages but you know the thing that actually

945
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,520
kind of strikes me worried about this is what if you live somewhere it doesn't

946
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:31,280
snow and you can't get like whatever is only going to come out only in that

947
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:36,880
weather my understanding is you there are not gonna be Pokemon that is limited

948
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:41,840
to weather so like there's nothing that will only spawn in snow but you're only

949
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:46,560
gonna be able to get stronger higher levels in snow it's kind of you'll have

950
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:52,280
to yeah so I mean you do get those penalties but it sounds like not living

951
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:55,840
in a snowy area is not gonna be the end of the world looking at the map to the

952
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:59,440
map will reflect the weather around you but they're saying though that one of

953
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:02,880
the disadvantages though of this new system is that if they think that

954
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:06,960
there's you know extreme weather outside they will actually reduce the amount of

955
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:10,100
spawns that are have like you know there's a screenshot I saw where

956
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:14,040
someone had one for snow he says extreme weather and you'll be careful going

957
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:18,720
outside and it's like there's a couple inches on the ground and that's it well

958
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:22,640
it sounds like those extreme weather alerts and Pokemon go are probably

959
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:28,640
triggered by actual you know warnings from the National Weather Service and

960
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:31,200
sometimes they put out warnings that aren't that serious not to sound

961
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:35,120
insensitive a man those fire types in LA are gonna be really strong that sounds a

962
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:40,240
little insensitive okay but well well but they're they're getting hit with the

963
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:44,360
extreme weather thing too in LA even if you're nowhere near those fires you know

964
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:47,560
you're getting hit with that right now but my understanding is it doesn't super

965
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:51,480
affect the spawn rate that bad but you're not gonna get any weather bonuses

966
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:55,600
in extreme conditions I think it feels like this might be a response in some

967
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:59,000
ways to remember when people were like playing Pokemon go in the hurricanes or

968
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:02,520
at least joking about it like you know if there's a motherfucking hurricane

969
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:08,080
coming to town put Pokemon go down I just number one I'm gonna go ahead and

970
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:12,020
spell this out for people who've never been in a fucking hurricane it sucks no

971
01:12:12,140 --> 01:12:19,140
a cat one isn't that bad it's just a blustery windstorm with some rain we've

972
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:23,420
we've had storms here that were like a cat one we really right so it's not a

973
01:12:23,420 --> 01:12:27,780
fucking big deal yeah if you live on the outskirts and you get the cat one level

974
01:12:27,780 --> 01:12:32,420
winds that's not a big deal okay I've been in a hurricane that did nothing but

975
01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:37,140
dump water on us for three days cycling out the bay and I walked to the fucking

976
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:41,620
circle K every night because we didn't have electricity right not that bad but

977
01:12:41,620 --> 01:12:46,220
when you are getting cat three and higher that's when people need to stop

978
01:12:46,220 --> 01:12:49,740
being stupid although I do know people who surf in hurricanes yeah and like

979
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:53,620
those poor folks in Puerto Rico and the cat five they got no fucking joke no

980
01:12:53,620 --> 01:12:58,540
that's no joke at all but I think that you know if it's when the storm is

981
01:12:58,540 --> 01:13:02,700
approaching I'm really not that concerned about it if you have your plan

982
01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:07,140
in place to get out of you've got your generator but you know you get to cat

983
01:13:07,140 --> 01:13:11,820
three level and higher that's when you GTFO or buck buckle down and have a

984
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:16,980
generator and don't do anything freaking stupid PS Pokemon will spawn in your

985
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:23,500
house hopefully unless you live in a really rural area like does evil do

986
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:29,580
Pokemon spawn in your house because it might not so anyway pardon me

987
01:13:29,580 --> 01:13:34,300
anyhow let's move on so that's Pokemon go but the news keeps coming this week

988
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:38,740
right yeah exactly so they were talking during the whole Mega Man 30th

989
01:13:38,740 --> 01:13:42,740
anniversary thing they were talking about all sorts of announcements one of

990
01:13:42,740 --> 01:13:47,260
which is that on all eight Mega Man X games are we coming to current gen

991
01:13:47,260 --> 01:13:52,740
platforms so PlayStation 4 Xbox one PC and even the switch in the summer of

992
01:13:52,740 --> 01:13:57,340
2018 along with that because the switch did not receive the Mega Man legacy

993
01:13:57,340 --> 01:14:01,820
collections they'll be getting legacy collections one and two which include

994
01:14:01,820 --> 01:14:06,780
Mega Man 1 through 10 and I'll be coming during 2018 as well one of the

995
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:10,860
surprise announcements well maybe not surprised if you did end up playing what

996
01:14:10,860 --> 01:14:15,100
some of those legacy collections and saw the leaked artwork that was in there but

997
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:20,580
Mega Man 11 was announced and make me 11 looks pretty amazing it actually the art

998
01:14:20,580 --> 01:14:25,420
style of it reminds me a lot of mighty number 9 it's like taking all and you

999
01:14:25,420 --> 01:14:28,940
know what people really wanted they wanted a modern Mega Man done like an

1000
01:14:28,940 --> 01:14:35,340
old Mega Man game with nicer graphics boom there it is and so I'm just kind of

1001
01:14:35,340 --> 01:14:40,100
I'm kind of been surprised so here's the first question that came to mind when I

1002
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:44,620
saw that and I got to admit like I saw that I was like yeah yes yeah it was

1003
01:14:44,620 --> 01:14:50,220
yes right another week of yes I was looking to that and very very into it and

1004
01:14:50,220 --> 01:14:53,020
I think yeah this is the Mega Man game that people have been asking for is like

1005
01:14:53,020 --> 01:14:57,860
just make a really fucking good 2d Mega Man that's all we want right here's my

1006
01:14:57,860 --> 01:15:05,140
question though do we have mighty number 9 to thank for Mega Man 11 maybe

1007
01:15:05,140 --> 01:15:09,860
what do you guys think in our chat over at live dot vog network calm do we have

1008
01:15:09,860 --> 01:15:14,540
mighty number 9 to thank for Mega Man 11 and what I mean by that is you can take

1009
01:15:14,540 --> 01:15:19,140
that a variety of ways because maybe the success of the Kickstarter and that

1010
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:23,040
people really wanted it or you could look at maybe the negative side of it

1011
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:26,860
where and then when it came out it got a really lukewarm reception and people

1012
01:15:26,860 --> 01:15:30,660
weren't that into it so maybe Capcom kind of felt they had to come in and say

1013
01:15:30,660 --> 01:15:36,180
all right all right y'all let me show you how it's done even though by Ron I

1014
01:15:36,180 --> 01:15:39,900
mean you know Fune made Mega Man Mega Man and then Mike but anyway also made

1015
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:45,860
money yeah but that whole complication aside you know going to our chat over at

1016
01:15:45,860 --> 01:15:51,380
live dot vog network calm act F says I think it did Mega Man 11 looks a lot

1017
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:55,660
like mighty number 9 dungeon buster says I think Capcom may have been waiting in

1018
01:15:55,660 --> 01:15:59,940
the anniversary this month was the perfect moment dr. Sia says a fair point

1019
01:15:59,940 --> 01:16:03,620
I mean he went and made it since Capcom apparently couldn't be bothered and now

1020
01:16:03,620 --> 01:16:08,500
Capcom saw that people were actually interested JD says impossible to say

1021
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:14,100
without inside Capcom information s 200 Matt says Mega Man 11 kicked mighty

1022
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:19,140
number 9 when it was already down so it looked really good and they shut off one

1023
01:16:19,140 --> 01:16:21,900
of the powers which I'm not sure what that would have been but he dropped

1024
01:16:21,900 --> 01:16:27,060
blocks basically almost looks like then didn't come out that like they had

1025
01:16:27,060 --> 01:16:32,860
actually dropped a hint in the second Mega Man collection yeah it was like a

1026
01:16:32,860 --> 01:16:36,740
character that they show yeah there was artwork in Mega Man 8 or something and

1027
01:16:36,740 --> 01:16:40,340
everybody looked at it going that's not in Mega Man what is that and I think

1028
01:16:40,340 --> 01:16:44,220
most people wrote it off as oh maybe it was like a concept that didn't see the

1029
01:16:44,220 --> 01:16:48,460
light of day like they didn't actually go through with this particular thing

1030
01:16:48,460 --> 01:16:51,820
and then come to find out oh they just they they punked you they teased you

1031
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:55,380
with a Mega Man 11 monster several months ago when that game came out so

1032
01:16:55,380 --> 01:16:59,980
that's that's kind of neat but yeah it looks really good so I'm very excited

1033
01:16:59,980 --> 01:17:03,420
to play it whenever it comes up and I think that's supposed to be I want to

1034
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:08,740
say next year late next year yeah so they teased it with a lot of time to go

1035
01:17:08,740 --> 01:17:12,860
so maybe they only had that one stage done who knows but we still got a year

1036
01:17:12,860 --> 01:17:17,260
to go on this that's fine it looks good so far yeah I think people are gonna be

1037
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:21,780
happy that Mega Man like it's happening don't fuck it up yeah because my number

1038
01:17:21,780 --> 01:17:28,980
nine good luck and don't fuck it up yeah and something else too they also

1039

1045
01:17:54,740 --> 01:17:59,820
not mistaken yes PC as well I don't remember the second one was I think the

1046
01:17:59,820 --> 01:18:04,940
first one was I know I bought the I think about one of them or both of them

1047
01:18:04,940 --> 01:18:13,020
on PlayStation 4 yeah to register participation for this week's episode of

1048
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:18,900
orange lounge radio at vog network comm use the passphrase warm anyhow you know

1049
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:22,260
something that's been in the news a lot lately is Bitcoin which is something I'm

1050
01:18:22,260 --> 01:18:26,620
and I'm not trying to be a hater I just don't think I understand a Bitcoin and I

1051
01:18:26,620 --> 01:18:31,260
remember I remember a couple years ago when dogecoin was the thing somebody

1052
01:18:31,260 --> 01:18:34,580
kind of taught me how to set that up and do the mining on my computer but I have

1053
01:18:34,580 --> 01:18:37,460
to admit I still don't know to this day what the fuck I was doing I'm pretty

1054
01:18:37,460 --> 01:18:41,460
sure I have some Bitcoin still in my wallet well you should look into that

1055
01:18:41,460 --> 01:18:44,580
because do you have you heard about how much that value has gone up that it's

1056
01:18:44,580 --> 01:18:49,980
appreciated like by a lot I think I had like 25 Bitcoin at the time uh girl like

1057
01:18:49,980 --> 01:18:53,860
one Bitcoin is worth like $10,000 right now fuck me I'm gonna check that when I

1058
01:18:53,860 --> 01:18:57,340
need to look into your voice if you've got if you're like ho-hum I just have

1059
01:18:57,340 --> 01:19:01,100
25 bitcoins sit around right now bitch you've got like a fucking like house

1060
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:04,700
fund right there if you can figure out a place to unload that Bitcoin well I mean

1061
01:19:04,700 --> 01:19:09,780
if I if I still had them because I bought I got Bitcoin like a while back

1062
01:19:09,780 --> 01:19:13,140
you might be thinking you have 25 Bitcoin but it turns out you have point

1063
01:19:13,140 --> 01:19:17,340
zero zero two five Bitcoin or something is that that is something that happens

1064
01:19:17,340 --> 01:19:22,060
too so well it's just like I got it like five years ago just because I was gonna

1065
01:19:22,060 --> 01:19:27,240
try using Bitcoin and then I never did anything with it okay so I I think it

1066
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:31,420
would be very wise of you like tonight after you leave this show you need to

1067
01:19:31,420 --> 01:19:34,900
fucking figure out how much Bitcoin you have and keep in mind when I say this

1068
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:39,620
right now in this story that I'm looking at at in gadget one Bitcoin is

1069
01:19:39,620 --> 01:19:43,660
worth thirteen thousand three hundred dollars as of this writing so if you're

1070
01:19:43,660 --> 01:19:48,460
like ho ho ho I have 25 Bitcoin just sitting around who knows where you

1071
01:19:48,460 --> 01:19:53,300
better fucking find it well I'll have to I mean I've got all the code written

1072
01:19:53,300 --> 01:19:56,700
down for my wallet so but just don't be disappointed if you go in there and it

1073
01:19:56,700 --> 01:20:01,540
turns out oh I had point zero zero zero two five but still yeah it's still you

1074
01:20:01,540 --> 01:20:07,220
might have like 20 bucks in Bitcoin sitting there so yeah you know anyway

1075
01:20:07,220 --> 01:20:10,780
let's see so anyway my point was one place you're not gonna be able to spend

1076
01:20:10,780 --> 01:20:15,100
that Bitcoin is on steam valve has stopped accepting Bitcoin right now

1077
01:20:15,100 --> 01:20:18,960
because of a combination of the transaction costs basically in the

1078
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:22,660
beginning it used to be 20 cents now it's like $20 for each transaction and

1079
01:20:22,660 --> 01:20:26,580
because of the high extreme you know the volatility of what this cryptocurrency

1080
01:20:26,580 --> 01:20:31,380
is going through which I still fail to understand again I'm not hating I just

1081
01:20:31,380 --> 01:20:36,660
don't understand what is the where does the worth on a Bitcoin come from because

1082
01:20:36,660 --> 01:20:40,940
isn't my understanding that a Bitcoin is basically like a crypto passage that

1083
01:20:40,940 --> 01:20:45,900
does nothing it's just digital currency it doesn't make sense I just I don't

1084
01:20:45,900 --> 01:20:49,700
get it but I mean again I'm not hating I just I don't understand look at it this

1085
01:20:49,700 --> 01:20:56,340
way it would be like if you if say that well or like okay I'll use origin for an

1086
01:20:56,340 --> 01:21:01,140
example origin has points right and the points you pay a certain dollar amount

1087
01:21:01,140 --> 01:21:04,740
to get a certain amount of points okay if the points were being used though as

1088
01:21:04,740 --> 01:21:09,180
a currency they would appreciate and depreciate the way that normal currency

1089
01:21:09,180 --> 01:21:16,780
does so in that light it is a okay so that's actually not a bad paper is

1090
01:21:16,780 --> 01:21:20,260
paperless money that's not a bad way to explain it actually I actually kind of

1091
01:21:20,260 --> 01:21:23,980
get it because you're right if more places took those origin points then

1092
01:21:23,980 --> 01:21:27,540
they might go up or down based on you know how many people are on origin with

1093
01:21:27,540 --> 01:21:31,580
how many points are out there okay I guess some communities do like community

1094
01:21:31,580 --> 01:21:36,140
dollars where you know say that you go out and do like some public service and

1095
01:21:36,140 --> 01:21:40,540
you earn community money and it's useful in that community you can redeem it for

1096
01:21:40,540 --> 01:21:46,820
services or or a small good here and it has a value attributed to it it really

1097
01:21:46,820 --> 01:21:52,300
is just honestly I honestly would think that it would be great if all currency

1098
01:21:52,300 --> 01:21:57,780
went digital because first of all the the money that we have actually costs

1099
01:21:57,780 --> 01:22:04,600
more to manufacture it than the individual amounts worth and so if

1100
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:09,220
everyone went digital and a lot of places now a lot of countries will have

1101
01:22:09,220 --> 01:22:16,220
like those NFR readers just about like as far as I'm more like I'll use as an

1102
01:22:16,220 --> 01:22:19,780
example because I was just reading about it vending machines in Japan almost all

1103
01:22:19,780 --> 01:22:25,500
of them will use NFR readers you know my Apple watch I don't have to have my

1104
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:29,260
card anymore I bought my wrist on whatever the terminal and I can pay for

1105
01:22:29,260 --> 01:22:35,380
my money if all of our currency went digital like Bitcoin first of all that

1106
01:22:35,380 --> 01:22:42,620
would probably contribute to an increase in commerce and lowering you know

1107
01:22:42,620 --> 01:22:46,460
whatever national deficit that goes into the manufacturer of money yeah and I

1108
01:22:46,460 --> 01:22:52,140
actually Jamie I kind of get it because like you you can forge a $5 bill

1109
01:22:52,140 --> 01:22:55,940
probably pretty easy you can make a forgery of a $5 bill most people don't

1110
01:22:55,940 --> 01:22:59,020
check $5 bills they check 20s they don't really check fives yeah so you can

1111
01:22:59,020 --> 01:23:01,820
probably forge a bunch of $5 bills and you would have essentially fake money

1112
01:23:01,820 --> 01:23:06,580
out there now real money has some type of special they actually a little bit of

1113
01:23:06,580 --> 01:23:08,900
gold in there they have some say you have something in it that gives it a

1114
01:23:08,900 --> 01:23:14,980
little value right well no the 20s do the metal strips are just basically like

1115
01:23:14,980 --> 01:23:22,260
for authentication right and the they'll have like micro lettering and

1116
01:23:22,260 --> 01:23:26,940
all kinds of you know lenticular tricks and everything I mean some of the money

1117
01:23:26,940 --> 01:23:31,540
in other countries is like fucking holographic but you can't fucking forge

1118
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:36,820
a Bitcoin no bitcoins every Bitcoin will have a digital signature on it and on

1119
01:23:36,820 --> 01:23:41,540
top of that too when you sign up for your wallet you are given because I like

1120
01:23:41,540 --> 01:23:45,100
I said I got my wallet about five years ago you're you don't have a password

1121
01:23:45,100 --> 01:23:51,340
you're given as an arbitrary series of like 12 words yeah that are your past

1122
01:23:51,340 --> 01:23:55,660
into your locker you lose that you have lost which in your locker which you

1123
01:23:55,660 --> 01:23:59,220
better not have lost your fucking locker I know where it is okay good girl you

1124
01:23:59,220 --> 01:24:03,060
know I kept that safe all I'm gonna remember is that just remember your

1125
01:24:03,060 --> 01:24:08,740
friend Rob Roberts when you're fucking filthy goddamn rich all this big we'll

1126
01:24:08,740 --> 01:24:13,460
see I already cashed him on my work stock all right that was really good

1127
01:24:13,460 --> 01:24:17,780
going to our chat come on Noel gust and chat says I can't slide digital currency

1128
01:24:17,780 --> 01:24:23,860
in a go-go boys G though well you could right if you had the actual key key

1129
01:24:23,860 --> 01:24:28,020
chain you know that's why they have like QR codes on coins right that's Bitcoin

1130
01:24:28,020 --> 01:24:34,020
but you know they also do make those little NFR readers for pay for payments

1131
01:24:34,140 --> 01:24:39,260
not like not like the square because the square is a slider but they have like

1132
01:24:39,260 --> 01:24:42,700
the little ones like the square you tap it on you can have that hooked up to a G

1133
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:47,980
just tap your wrist on it like take my Apple pay so you could actually tap that

1134
01:24:47,980 --> 01:24:53,880
ass you could tap that ass you like that come on no Gus what would you rather do

1135
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:57,460
do you want to slide digital currency in the go-go boys G or do you want to tap

1136
01:24:57,460 --> 01:25:04,520
that ass or you know I bet that they would do like like voucher conversions

1137
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:11,660
for stuff like that you know they have a Bitcoin ATM at the mall that I've seen

1138
01:25:11,660 --> 01:25:15,660
yeah I look at them like I feel so I don't get what would I use that for like

1139
01:25:15,660 --> 01:25:20,100
I always feel so old like I'm a god this is this is what my parents must have

1140
01:25:20,100 --> 01:25:23,300
went through like when I was talking about Nintendo and stuff like I don't

1141
01:25:23,300 --> 01:25:29,060
understand anyway let's see SSG 100 Matt says she'll remember you talking

1142
01:25:29,060 --> 01:25:32,300
about Jamie she'll remember you Rob when she puts you in charge of her personal

1143
01:25:32,300 --> 01:25:36,580
pinkberry franchise location Oh goody you know I haven't had pinkberry in like

1144
01:25:36,580 --> 01:25:39,340
a year and a half I haven't had in a long time either because my husband

1145
01:25:39,340 --> 01:25:44,220
prefers yogurt land and sometimes you give up the things you like for your

1146
01:25:45,220 --> 01:25:50,620
pecan pie flavored right now we're going we're gonna pinkberry well we'll be done

1147
01:25:50,620 --> 01:25:54,580
we won't be doing the show in time all right probably not tonight next Saturday

1148
01:25:54,580 --> 01:25:59,740
we're gonna be very uh actually we have company from out of town here who might

1149
01:25:59,740 --> 01:26:02,820
be into that so we'll see oh well they're coming to then all right even if

1150
01:26:02,820 --> 01:26:07,340
they're not they're coming all right sounds good okay uh let's see and by the

1151
01:26:07,340 --> 01:26:11,820
way just also since the story was about steam and Bitcoin I did just want to

1152
01:26:11,820 --> 01:26:16,460
point out valve is not ruling out a return to Bitcoin in the future but not

1153
01:26:16,460 --> 01:26:22,060
until the volatility of Bitcoin settles down by the way as some of you nerds

1154
01:26:22,060 --> 01:26:25,660
probably know there's not just Bitcoin out there there's other digital

1155
01:26:25,660 --> 01:26:30,380
currency right like aetherium is another one I remember dogecoin is that worth

1156
01:26:30,380 --> 01:26:33,980
anything now because I might have dogecoin um and then what's the other

1157
01:26:33,980 --> 01:26:37,580
one that my friend was telling me this that he bought this litecoin is another

1158
01:26:37,580 --> 01:26:43,020
one so aetherium is another one now yeah which I just said I'm sorry I'm

1159
01:26:43,020 --> 01:26:49,660
checking we're tied now and the dogecoin price for today is 0.00 to $5 oh so it's

1160
01:26:49,660 --> 01:26:53,220
a quarter of a penny I think I don't even think I have like one dogecoin so

1161
01:26:53,220 --> 01:27:00,260
that's great I'm glad I did all that mining for dogecoin all right let's move

1162
01:27:00,260 --> 01:27:06,580
on with some more news dark Sakura well we like portal we like portal a lot and

1163
01:27:06,580 --> 01:27:14,460
portal is going to be in a collaboration for bridge constructor so

1164
01:27:14,460 --> 01:27:19,380
clockstone software and valve are putting it together to build bridges

1165
01:27:19,380 --> 01:27:27,980
with portals and so it looks interesting but it looks very silly and it has like

1166
01:27:27,980 --> 01:27:34,340
the little people figures like they have in the the portal ads you know like the

1167
01:27:34,340 --> 01:27:37,500
this is how you get from point A to point B and there's turrets and

1168
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:41,220
everything it's adorable there's a door a bubble but you have to get the

1169
01:27:41,220 --> 01:27:45,380
aperture truck across the bridge and what do you build this out of aetherium

1170
01:27:45,380 --> 01:27:51,300
portals oh you can run over turrets with your truck that's amazing is this

1171
01:27:51,300 --> 01:27:54,660
something you might check out cuz it's my it's half portal which is something

1172
01:27:54,660 --> 01:28:01,140
you're like super into I know oh it's glad us this is so cute I just want a

1173
01:28:01,140 --> 01:28:05,220
new portal you just want a new portal game you want portal three Oh portal

1174
01:28:05,220 --> 01:28:09,500
three doesn't know how to count bitcoins are gonna fucking take for valve to give

1175
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:13,540
us portals but anything anything with a three in it pretty much at this point do

1176
01:28:13,540 --> 01:28:17,240
I really mean anything is there any valve franchise doesn't believe in

1177
01:28:17,240 --> 01:28:24,140
threesomes Rob so apparently apparently which is lame all right I agree just a

1178
01:28:24,140 --> 01:28:28,220
few more stories before we get to the classic system of the month you guys

1179
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:32,460
it's the last classic system it's December 2017 we're gonna get to that

1180
01:28:32,460 --> 01:28:38,740
in just a couple more stories it is Loki all right so this is odd but apparently

1181
01:28:38,740 --> 01:28:47,140
Nintendo is teaming up with Nvidia to release Wii games on the Nvidia shield

1182
01:28:47,140 --> 01:28:52,300
in China though so they're gonna have a number of older Nintendo games like New

1183
01:28:52,300 --> 01:28:56,540
Super Mario Brothers Super Mario Galaxy and Twilight Princess made for the

1184
01:28:56,540 --> 01:29:04,620
Nvidia shield that's interesting and I don't know how that's gonna work but I

1185
01:29:04,620 --> 01:29:10,580
mean does the shield have like wireless does it have like motion controls or

1186
01:29:10,580 --> 01:29:13,380
something I mean how the hell does that work if they have a like Wii remote for

1187
01:29:13,380 --> 01:29:18,980
that I mean I guess it's Bluetooth so you could well a lot of the games I was

1188
01:29:18,980 --> 01:29:23,340
noticing two things like New Super Mario Brothers Wii and stuff you know those

1189
01:29:23,340 --> 01:29:27,460
aren't games that really require motion control either true I guess it makes

1190
01:29:27,460 --> 01:29:34,060
sense but Mario Galaxy does though no I guess that's true yeah it does so maybe

1191
01:29:34,060 --> 01:29:37,260
something with the touchscreen on those things because maybe you can tap the

1192
01:29:37,260 --> 01:29:43,300
touchscreen I bet I bet it would work something yeah hmm I'm wondering though

1193
01:29:43,300 --> 01:29:47,740
because I want to this is that run on Android I mean I can't see how this

1194
01:29:47,740 --> 01:29:51,340
isn't gonna leak out that's that's my question too that was the first use I

1195
01:29:51,340 --> 01:29:56,900
okay it's coming out in China and you know China has a lot of people but not a

1196
01:29:56,900 --> 01:30:00,740
lot of the same games that we have here so I'm sure these companies are seeing

1197
01:30:00,740 --> 01:30:04,620
this as Oh potential huge market expansion with things that are not gonna

1198
01:30:04,620 --> 01:30:08,860
cost us anything especially Wii games those games for the most part they're

1199
01:30:08,860 --> 01:30:12,220
done here in the u.s. like you're never gonna sell Wii games and really make

1200
01:30:12,220 --> 01:30:17,660
money off them unless maybe virtual console but that whole question mark

1201
01:30:18,180 --> 01:30:24,580
games on the switch not yet because the switch is technically it's basically an

1202
01:30:24,580 --> 01:30:30,620
Nvidia shield so yeah so I don't know I would think that who knows that should

1203
01:30:30,620 --> 01:30:33,900
be very doable that was my thought is that the Nvidia shield is kind of a PC

1204
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:36,820
based thing right so what's to prevent these games from leaking out over here

1205
01:30:36,820 --> 01:30:42,140
Tegra basic game system just like the switch okay but but at the end of the

1206
01:30:42,140 --> 01:30:46,460
day then you know maybe Nintendo's going it doesn't matter if the Wii games leak

1207
01:30:46,460 --> 01:30:50,060
out in the u.s. we've we've done made our money off those games already this

1208
01:30:50,060 --> 01:30:57,940
is just more money this is money for nothing it's Bitcoin I mean it's a good

1209
01:30:57,940 --> 01:31:01,900
idea because they've never had really consoles in China so that's you know

1210
01:31:01,900 --> 01:31:06,900
these this is gonna be a new thing for the people live there but is it really I

1211
01:31:06,900 --> 01:31:14,700
mean worth the check out there hey Alan Alan just got home Alan come here come

1212
01:31:14,820 --> 01:31:18,380
here I'm gonna totally derail the show but I have to show this so Jamie got us

1213
01:31:18,380 --> 01:31:24,580
holiday presents this is an outfit for mr. smoosh and look at this this is a

1214
01:31:24,580 --> 01:31:28,140
crinkle cat tunnel and you know he's gonna love the shit out of this

1215
01:31:28,140 --> 01:31:34,340
fantastic I love it there you go but did you show them oh yeah and then this is

1216
01:31:34,340 --> 01:31:40,100
for us it's a mermaid tail with the sequins that change colors that is also

1217
01:31:40,100 --> 01:31:45,180
incredible does this girl know us or what and I got you unicorn heads yes

1218
01:31:45,180 --> 01:31:47,540
and there's there's more seven here peek around in here's there's candles and

1219
01:31:47,540 --> 01:31:51,920
things here and candy so there you go but unfortunately chat room there's no

1220
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:56,380
etherium in the bag but there's always 20 in the theorem is made of the ether

1221
01:31:56,380 --> 01:32:01,220
all right I got one more story for you guys then we'll get to the classic stuff

1222
01:32:01,220 --> 01:32:05,220
this one is about Facebook yes that's right I'm gonna do a story about

1223
01:32:05,220 --> 01:32:09,660
Facebook who remembers that Facebook actually has games built into messenger

1224
01:32:09,660 --> 01:32:14,260
because I mean there's things I blocked oh god my wife tried to play those I'm

1225
01:32:14,260 --> 01:32:17,220
not even talking about like fucking Farmville and that shit I'm talking

1226
01:32:17,220 --> 01:32:21,460
about like you can actually do in a messenger like what I could do nope you

1227
01:32:21,460 --> 01:32:24,460
better not message so here's something to do I'm gonna open up messenger right

1228
01:32:24,460 --> 01:32:30,020
now so I'm gonna go into messenger live here on air and I'm gonna start a new

1229
01:32:30,020 --> 01:32:35,380
conversation with Jamie and I'm gonna hit the ball there and then I'm gonna

1230
01:32:35,380 --> 01:32:41,540
hit this little button what is it I hit the plus sign and there's games and all

1231
01:32:41,540 --> 01:32:46,460
these games come up okay played recently pac-man play and then it's actually

1232
01:32:46,460 --> 01:32:50,460
loading pac-man onto my phone and then Jamie's gonna get a message that I'm

1233
01:32:50,460 --> 01:32:54,540
forcing her to play pack but yes challenge Jamie play now so there you go

1234
01:32:54,540 --> 01:32:59,140
and now it's loading and I can actually play pac-man so that's that's that's

1235
01:32:59,140 --> 01:33:04,460
actually all built into messenger so in my ringer is off anyway so you're not

1236
01:33:04,460 --> 01:33:08,020
gonna be able to hear any hear anything but basically once I were to get a score

1237
01:33:08,020 --> 01:33:11,100
in this I think you would see it and then you can like try to challenge my

1238
01:33:11,100 --> 01:33:17,740
score and beat it or whatever well because I turned the game off because I'm

1239
01:33:17,740 --> 01:33:21,140
trying to do a radio show but anyway there's other games in this messenger

1240
01:33:21,140 --> 01:33:25,140
thing too I it's something called ever wing I don't even know what half these

1241
01:33:25,140 --> 01:33:28,660
games are but there's you know little Facebook games but my point is

1242
01:33:28,660 --> 01:33:33,140
apparently something that Facebook is gonna be doing to celebrate one year of

1243
01:33:33,140 --> 01:33:38,220
games on messenger is to actually you can tap a camera icon in the upper

1244
01:33:38,220 --> 01:33:43,740
right-hand corner of the game screen and stream on Facebook live so I could

1245
01:33:43,740 --> 01:33:48,540
actually stream myself going this is me kicking Jamie's ass at pac-man live on

1246
01:33:48,540 --> 01:33:54,540
Facebook because Facebook desperately wants a piece of that twitch profit and

1247
01:33:54,540 --> 01:33:58,780
mixer and all that stuff Facebook really badly wants to be a contender in this I

1248
01:33:58,780 --> 01:34:02,420
personally think Facebook should stay the hell out of it not just because

1249
01:34:02,420 --> 01:34:06,860
they're Facebook but because I think the audience on like all the people on

1250
01:34:06,860 --> 01:34:10,580
my Facebook don't really want to see me playing video games like the audience

1251
01:34:10,580 --> 01:34:14,340
that's on my twitch is a very specific curated network that wants to be there I

1252
01:34:14,340 --> 01:34:20,540
think Facebook should stick to maybe life streaming and you suck my

1253
01:34:20,540 --> 01:34:27,180
battleship and so forth so anyway so you can stream that on Facebook live and it

1254
01:34:27,180 --> 01:34:31,860
is available I guess starting today but then later in 2018 you can play games

1255
01:34:31,900 --> 01:34:36,740
with friends from within a video chat in real time so you can see people's

1256
01:34:36,740 --> 01:34:40,620
reactions so one of the first games that's gonna get this is words with

1257
01:34:40,620 --> 01:34:45,780
friends so Jamie can actually see my reaction when she or maybe when it gets

1258
01:34:45,780 --> 01:34:48,940
battleship she can actually see my reaction live when she sinks my

1259
01:34:48,940 --> 01:34:56,460
battleship there's a game on here called mr. ah fuck these games are so stupid or

1260
01:34:56,460 --> 01:35:01,100
non cat when we're playing words with friends Jamie can see my reaction I get

1261
01:35:01,100 --> 01:35:04,660
really angry going what do you mean cunt isn't an acceptable word best to

1262
01:35:04,660 --> 01:35:13,020
move is on here all right let's let's go to classic times when you know what we

1263
01:35:13,020 --> 01:35:19,140
didn't we didn't have these messenger systems in our pockets we had beepers

1264
01:35:19,140 --> 01:35:24,900
actually I never had a beeper because that's my mom said Rob only drug drug

1265
01:35:25,180 --> 01:35:31,620
only drug dealers have beepers Rob if you have a beeper you're a drug dealer

1266
01:35:31,620 --> 01:35:40,140
dad has a beeper dad needs a beeper for work no my dad works for the railroad

1267
01:35:40,140 --> 01:35:47,700
don't leave one of my dad all right it's the classic game of the week but once a

1268
01:35:47,700 --> 01:35:53,740
month dark Sakura puts Facebook down and she steps in the game she says hey

1269
01:35:53,780 --> 01:35:58,060
here's a classic system for you to enjoy why celebrate the game when you can

1270
01:35:58,060 --> 01:36:02,140
celebrate the whole damn system she's been doing this every month at 2017 and

1271
01:36:02,140 --> 01:36:06,860
guess what guys tonight is the last one it is the segment gets retired after

1272
01:36:06,860 --> 01:36:12,060
tonight end of our classic system of the month so I picked a stinker so here it

1273
01:36:12,060 --> 01:36:18,100
is what is the classic system of the month the fairchild channel F lip lip

1274
01:36:18,100 --> 01:36:23,720
lip lip wow that riveting soundtrack the fairchild channel F was created

1275
01:36:23,720 --> 01:36:30,160
by a fairchild semiconductor in 1976 it sold for a hundred and sixty nine

1276
01:36:30,160 --> 01:36:35,040
dollars and ninety five cents which Rob find one of those little like money

1277
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:41,000
converter thing which was like 50 Bitcoin back in 1976 you find one of

1278
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:51,480
the converters for me 160 995 okay it sold 250,000 units by 1977 it was

1279
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:55,880
originally just called the video entertainment system or VES but then

1280
01:36:55,880 --> 01:37:03,640
Atari released the VCS the next year so they changed the name of the system the

1281
01:37:03,640 --> 01:37:09,640
channel F it was it was actually one of what what is this talking you sent a

1282
01:37:09,640 --> 01:37:16,960
video that has some guy I just look for whatever it's fucking blip blip all right

1283
01:37:16,960 --> 01:37:21,520
blip blip there it is all right okay but anyway one of a couple of the big

1284
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:24,760
signifiers of the fairchild channel F it was the first programmable ROM

1285
01:37:24,760 --> 01:37:29,880
cartridge based video game console and it was the first one that used a micro

1286
01:37:29,880 --> 01:37:40,160
processor so really the the fairchild channel F is our big big big like

1287
01:37:40,160 --> 01:37:46,680
granddaddy to what we've got today the the graphics I mean they're fairly

1288
01:37:46,720 --> 01:37:52,680
basic it was the 70s you know when pong was the thing at the time the resolution

1289
01:37:52,680 --> 01:38:03,280
is 128 by 64 64 bytes of RAM which is half of what the Atari 2600 had but you

1290
01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:10,800
it had enough AI compatibility or a I was sort of thinking of capability so

1291
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:16,000
that you could play versus the machine and it was also another first so this

1292
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:22,840
really did I'd say pave the way for a lot of what we have today it also had a

1293
01:38:22,840 --> 01:38:27,480
hold button which would let you pause your game you could also change the time

1294
01:38:27,480 --> 01:38:32,840
or change the speed of your game in the first iterations of the fairchild

1295
01:38:32,840 --> 01:38:39,320
channel F it had an internal speaker but the system to put that out through an RF

1296
01:38:39,320 --> 01:38:45,400
modulator so that your TV would play it now the the controllers I'll tell you

1297
01:38:45,400 --> 01:38:49,960
this they're they're kind of shite they're they're different because I mean

1298
01:38:49,960 --> 01:38:55,320
back then I mean people hadn't really locked down to any particular controller

1299
01:38:55,320 --> 01:39:04,120
style there were these these sticks that had a little analog peg on it well not

1300
01:39:04,120 --> 01:39:09,800
analog but it was an eight-way directional control and it can be used

1301
01:39:09,800 --> 01:39:15,320
as a paddle to twist it or it could be used as a joystick and it could be

1302
01:39:15,320 --> 01:39:21,440
pushed in as a fire button so it was really very versatile it just wasn't

1303
01:39:21,440 --> 01:39:28,320
very great and they also had another controller that was that well first of

1304
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:31,680
all the first version they were hardwired and the system to they were

1305
01:39:31,680 --> 01:39:38,320
detachable a company called zircon offered another one that had an action

1306
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:42,400
button on the front of the joystick it was called the channel F jet stick came

1307
01:39:42,400 --> 01:39:49,000
out in 1982 and even though the channel F wasn't all that great people did

1308
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:53,520
really like the the joystick it was really novel I personally did not care

1309
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:58,880
for it myself there were a lot of video carts that came out that's what they

1310
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:05,040
called their cartridges some of them could do more than one game and they

1311
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:10,640
were roughly 20 bucks a pop each of them was the size actually kind of about

1312
01:40:10,640 --> 01:40:13,200
the size and shape of an 8-track cartridge which none of y'all know what

1313
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:18,600
that is unless you're us or you've been to like a garage sale or or a flea

1314
01:40:18,600 --> 01:40:23,880
market you know I had a collection of 8 tracks when I was a kid my grandma had

1315
01:40:23,880 --> 01:40:29,400
an Abba 8 track she's awesome anyway I want to answer an earlier question real

1316
01:40:29,400 --> 01:40:34,400
quick okay hundred sixty nine dollars in 1976 worth seven hundred and twenty

1317
01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:39,280
seven dollars and four cents today yeah and because I know the chatters are

1318
01:40:39,280 --> 01:40:43,840
gonna ask that's about one and a half a theory on the current rate whatever

1319
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:50,960
anyway as of 1978 there were three keyboard video carts for sale there was

1320
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:56,240
k1 casino poker k2 space odyssey in k3 pro football and they were supposed to

1321
01:40:56,280 --> 01:41:01,440
use the keyboard peripheral that was supposed to come out with it but yeah

1322
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:06,040
they're all the video cards like word were numbered and like the very last one

1323
01:41:06,040 --> 01:41:12,600
that came out in December 1981 was called alien invasion the very first one

1324
01:41:12,600 --> 01:41:19,120
September 1977 was just the demo card so you know there were there was like a

1325
01:41:19,120 --> 01:41:24,760
pinball game and hangman and video whiz ball which just makes me laugh whiz ball

1326
01:41:24,760 --> 01:41:30,600
but the keyboard ones were never released they there was a German company

1327
01:41:30,600 --> 01:41:34,240
that released a few compatible cartridges as well but for the most part

1328
01:41:34,240 --> 01:41:42,080
the the channel F was pretty much in general a commercial failure you know

1329
01:41:42,080 --> 01:41:49,760
trying to compete with you know by 1982 when Atari had so many other games out

1330
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:52,880
and then there was also the Intellivision the astrocade the Odyssey

1331
01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:59,360
you know the channel F was just below average according to its rating you know

1332
01:41:59,360 --> 01:42:04,400
it didn't really have a whole lot of interest in it and so in 1983 zircon

1333
01:42:04,400 --> 01:42:11,840
discontinued the fairchild channel F and it was basically what no one wanted it

1334
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:21,920
was so a little bit of the the specs for it a fairchild 8-bit processor a 1.7 9

1335
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:28,440
megahertz NTSC processor 2 kilobytes of RAM with 64 bytes for its scratchpad

1336
01:42:28,440 --> 01:42:40,520
memory 128 by 64 pixels monitor 60 Hertz refresh rate 8 colors 8 by 8 by 8 or 4

1337
01:42:40,520 --> 01:42:49,040
by 5 variable sprite size and that's it the fairchild channel F there it is your

1338
01:42:49,040 --> 01:42:52,600
classic system of the month I say I would question mark is the system

1339
01:42:52,600 --> 01:42:57,880
doesn't sound that classic but notable if nothing else it led to having it was

1340
01:42:57,880 --> 01:43:01,440
the first used cartridges that's true it was first with a microprocessor that's

1341
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:07,320
true so it had a creator of this passed away in the past year or two I believe

1342
01:43:07,320 --> 01:43:12,240
because I remember seeing a story about it and in that we had him to thank for

1343
01:43:12,240 --> 01:43:20,960
the cartridge based gaming and all that yeah his name was is slash was Jerry

1344
01:43:20,960 --> 01:43:27,680
Lawson yeah yeah so and you know again not the greatest one but would we have

1345
01:43:27,680 --> 01:43:34,280
had what we had you know at the time and on top of this too you know just to

1346
01:43:34,280 --> 01:43:41,120
point out he was a african-american gentleman doing computer programming in

1347
01:43:41,120 --> 01:43:45,320
an age where you didn't hear about a lot of african-american you did not

1348
01:43:45,320 --> 01:43:49,720
programming and so like there weren't a lot of women doing programming either

1349
01:43:49,720 --> 01:43:52,920
which is why it's great that the Game Awards recognized Carol Shaw by the way

1350
01:43:52,920 --> 01:43:57,000
I just had to make sure that got it was women who put man on the moon that's

1351
01:43:57,000 --> 01:44:01,800
true enough but yeah he passed away April 9th 2011 oh that was I was a

1352
01:44:01,800 --> 01:44:06,440
longer time ago than I thought I thought that was more recent but okay yeah but

1353
01:44:06,440 --> 01:44:12,040
you know we we have him to thank for what we have today all right know your

1354
01:44:12,040 --> 01:44:17,400
history folks there it is the classic system of the month and that brings the

1355
01:44:17,400 --> 01:44:23,800
classic system series to a close how do you feel looking back dark soccer how

1356
01:44:23,800 --> 01:44:27,880
do you feel about the classic system of the month did you like that as a 2017

1357
01:44:27,880 --> 01:44:31,800
twist it was fun what did the listeners think I came up with it to be different

1358
01:44:31,800 --> 01:44:34,920
yeah and so I wouldn't have to think of a you know at least 12 games you have to

1359
01:44:34,920 --> 01:44:39,000
be bitingly different by the way let's just recap just so y'all remember so

1360
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:44,000
let's take let's take a trip down memory lane of our trips down memory lane it's

1361
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:53,080
actually not our trip down memory lane in January we had the FM towns Marty

1362
01:44:53,080 --> 01:45:02,120
February was the PC FX March was the WonderSwan April was the MSX May was the

1363
01:45:02,120 --> 01:45:10,600
TI 99 4a June was the Magnavox Odyssey 2 July was the ZX spectrum or the ZX

1364
01:45:10,600 --> 01:45:15,720
August was the engage September although I think we technically did that in

1365
01:45:15,720 --> 01:45:21,280
October but it was September was the Panasonic Q actual October was the

1366
01:45:21,280 --> 01:45:27,960
Pippen November was the X 86,000 and we closed it out for December with the

1367
01:45:27,960 --> 01:45:36,480
Fairchild channel so there it is your 2017 twist of the classic system of the

1368
01:45:36,480 --> 01:45:42,360
month you know the very first video game system I ever personally owned was a ti

1369
01:45:42,360 --> 01:45:50,160
99 mine was a Commodore 64 I'm pretty sure so we had a clico Adam as well but

1370
01:45:50,160 --> 01:45:57,120
the ti 99 was the first one um the second one that we owned we when I was a

1371
01:45:57,120 --> 01:46:02,080
kid I never owned an Atari an Atari system yeah we had a clico vision and

1372
01:46:02,080 --> 01:46:06,520
that thing fucking rocked I love the clico vision now we are gonna take a

1373
01:46:06,520 --> 01:46:11,520
quick break but at 68,000 did I screw up and say something wrong no no but

1374
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:14,680
apparently dark touch yes thinks that you did well it wouldn't be the first

1375
01:46:14,680 --> 01:46:18,320
time anyway before we can't go to a break we are gonna go to a break here

1376
01:46:18,320 --> 01:46:21,320
but do we want to tell the listeners what they have to look forward to in

1377
01:46:21,320 --> 01:46:26,840
2018 sure is the twist don't stop y'all I'm a twisty bitch all right so the

1378
01:46:26,840 --> 01:46:31,080
classic game of the week will still be here but once a month what's gonna

1379
01:46:31,080 --> 01:46:37,680
happen we'll have the peripheral of the month where it you don't know what it

1380
01:46:37,680 --> 01:46:43,320
could be it could be a I'm trying to think of weird was an activator mm-hmm

1381
01:46:43,320 --> 01:46:46,600
it could be para para biscuits all I have to say is it better be the fucking

1382
01:46:46,600 --> 01:46:53,560
power glove at some point it's so bad it could be rod caliber there you go so

1383
01:46:53,560 --> 01:46:58,200
next year you have the classic peripheral of the month that would be a

1384
01:46:58,200 --> 01:47:02,600
little bit easier to extend into another year there's been plenty of them

1385
01:47:02,600 --> 01:47:06,840
especially when the a lot of shit pads yeah there's a lot of stuff that comes

1386
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:09,760
out and then it kind of goes nowhere maybe I'll just do a family of them or

1387
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:14,760
something but you know I tell you one that's gonna have to be on there and

1388
01:47:14,760 --> 01:47:17,080
I'll go ahead and announce it cuz it's one of my favorite ones and I wish I

1389
01:47:17,080 --> 01:47:20,800

1399
01:48:06,980 --> 01:48:11,540
2017 with our seven hundred and tenth episode already in progress as we inch

1400
01:48:11,540 --> 01:48:15,500
closer and closer to the end of the year during the break their dark Sakura

1401
01:48:15,500 --> 01:48:18,740
tapping away at her Animal Crossing pocket camp because I know she's a huge

1402
01:48:18,780 --> 01:48:23,660
fan I'm close to level 42 my gosh I can't that's that's I mean that's great

1403
01:48:23,660 --> 01:48:27,380
but you know I'm just like dang that must take a lot of effort how long it

1404
01:48:27,380 --> 01:48:31,140
takes being really bored do you just kind of sit there and tap away at it

1405
01:48:31,140 --> 01:48:34,620
when you're like supposed to be doing stuff must be what it was I don't know

1406
01:48:34,620 --> 01:48:37,940
watching TV or something but I don't watch TV yeah I know that's what I was

1407
01:48:37,940 --> 01:48:40,900
thinking is that you don't really I usually will Dan and I would like do

1408
01:48:40,900 --> 01:48:44,740
YouTube stuff we'll watch it okay I'll have it on like while I'm you know

1409
01:48:44,780 --> 01:48:48,820
watching stuff on the internet or talking with Becky or something cuz

1410
01:48:48,820 --> 01:48:53,340
there you go yeah we chatter regularly because we're besties of course that's

1411
01:48:53,340 --> 01:48:58,100
what that's what happens you know I'll play during my break at work yeah so good

1412
01:48:58,100 --> 01:49:03,180
deal during my break any I know it's a little early to talk about New Year's

1413
01:49:03,180 --> 01:49:06,460
resolutions and some people kind of feel and the whole thing anyway but is there

1414
01:49:06,460 --> 01:49:09,900
anything maybe in 2018 that you're gonna like try to accomplish or something

1415
01:49:09,900 --> 01:49:14,020
you're trying to do in 2018 no no I don't I don't make the resolutions

1416
01:49:14,020 --> 01:49:19,780
anymore you know I I'm more do right around you know the ten days between

1417
01:49:19,780 --> 01:49:24,980
Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur is meant to be spent in introspection deciding

1418
01:49:24,980 --> 01:49:29,060
what worked for you in the year and what didn't and how to move forward you know

1419
01:49:29,060 --> 01:49:34,500
having things that you apologize for in the year or things that you regret doing

1420
01:49:34,500 --> 01:49:40,500
you can say that you apologize or that you regret them but it doesn't make any

1421
01:49:40,540 --> 01:49:44,540
fucking difference if you don't make an effort to not do those things anymore

1422
01:49:44,540 --> 01:49:48,700
right and that's more what I'm looking at besides that you know I've got other

1423
01:49:48,700 --> 01:49:52,540
things that are happening that I think as far as the road there I know I'm

1424
01:49:52,540 --> 01:49:57,580
getting way too deep into this but it's fine it's but resolutions to me I didn't

1425
01:49:57,580 --> 01:50:00,540
mean for it to be a deep question but it's okay if it is that's fine no I was

1426
01:50:00,540 --> 01:50:03,380
just thinking about it cuz it really just it's been something that's been on

1427
01:50:03,380 --> 01:50:08,020
my mind yeah and I think that the big thing that I really want to do is just

1428
01:50:08,020 --> 01:50:13,620
be I don't want to say this is bad let's change it I want to be the best

1429
01:50:13,620 --> 01:50:17,100
version of myself I can be right I guess the way I'm kind of looking at it like

1430
01:50:17,100 --> 01:50:20,540
you know obviously with your Jewish faith being important to you and in I

1431
01:50:20,540 --> 01:50:23,140
that totally makes sense that this more like Jewish New Year is a very kind of

1432
01:50:23,140 --> 01:50:26,380
different sort of tradition for me I don't necessarily have that same thing

1433
01:50:26,380 --> 01:50:29,500
but you know that 2017 for me and I think everybody out there knows it's

1434
01:50:29,500 --> 01:50:32,580
been a horrible year for me I mean you guys all know and I was just thinking

1435
01:50:32,580 --> 01:50:35,900
back today just not only with the whole fact that you know that I lost my mom

1436
01:50:35,900 --> 01:50:40,220
over the summer but really like but really how long that went on you know

1437
01:50:40,220 --> 01:50:44,140
that wasn't just like suddenly one day you know in July she was gone but it was

1438
01:50:44,140 --> 01:50:47,700
just like months and months leading up to that with her being the ICU and

1439
01:50:47,700 --> 01:50:50,200
everything right not to be a downer right now that's just the reality of you

1440
01:50:50,200 --> 01:50:53,220
know some kind of looking back at 2017 it was all that and then you know

1441
01:50:53,220 --> 01:50:55,980
everything that happened with Sanrio knew all the other stuff so I'm really

1442
01:50:55,980 --> 01:51:00,460
trying to look at it it's like okay you know yes it's just another year but at

1443
01:51:00,460 --> 01:51:03,460
the same time it's like it's something about like tearing down that calendar

1444
01:51:03,460 --> 01:51:07,780
and putting the new one up is very much like okay this year is gonna be less

1445
01:51:07,780 --> 01:51:11,460
suck than 2017 or at least I really hope so I mean there's gonna be things that

1446
01:51:11,460 --> 01:51:15,700
probably happen then an audio control but like what can I do and you know for

1447
01:51:15,700 --> 01:51:18,940
me I definitely want to keep doing olr you know I think that's something we

1448
01:51:18,940 --> 01:51:24,000
all kind of want to keep doing in 2018 I really want to pick up I feel like with

1449
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:28,780
the streaming thing I had a lot of great steam going on like my twitch thing and

1450
01:51:28,780 --> 01:51:31,180
I was getting really good at that especially if you're using steam and

1451
01:51:31,180 --> 01:51:34,740
then oh yeah who were playing stream games on Twitch and then like I think I

1452
01:51:34,740 --> 01:51:37,540
think over the summer I really picked that up and I got the affiliate and then

1453
01:51:37,540 --> 01:51:40,820
like when my mom passed it's like a lot of that hit a brick road and I was kind

1454
01:51:40,820 --> 01:51:43,980
of like picking it up again and it's like like that train kept derailing and

1455
01:51:43,980 --> 01:51:47,300
it's like I think that's something that I want to do more of and I know I can do

1456
01:51:47,300 --> 01:51:49,820
a good job but I'm really gonna have to like I think it's something I'm gonna

1457
01:51:49,820 --> 01:51:54,140
challenge myself to do in 2018 is really kind of think out in advance the way I

1458
01:51:54,140 --> 01:51:59,340
know more that more other live streamers do it what am I gonna stream why and

1459
01:51:59,340 --> 01:52:04,460
when and really try to tack that down as opposed to oh it's a random Friday

1460
01:52:04,460 --> 01:52:07,660
night and I'm bored I'm gonna play Final Fantasy 14 on my stream I don't think

1461
01:52:07,660 --> 01:52:11,860
there's anything wrong with that but I do definitely want to try to like try to

1462
01:52:11,860 --> 01:52:15,540
and I also don't want to say hold myself accountable because that makes myself I

1463
01:52:15,540 --> 01:52:19,020
don't know that makes it sound like it's a job and not exactly it's a job and not

1464
01:52:19,020 --> 01:52:24,700
fun but I just I want to kind of maybe try to hold myself to a better schedule

1465
01:52:24,700 --> 01:52:28,700
if that makes sense that makes sense yeah you know I I have something that I

1466
01:52:28,700 --> 01:52:33,900
wanted to propose to you offline but I know that oh my god this bunny has an

1467
01:52:33,900 --> 01:52:39,580
inflatable nozzle in the back of its head anyway um but and this is something

1468
01:52:39,580 --> 01:52:45,620
that we talked about before was you know doing different and new things in the

1469
01:52:45,620 --> 01:52:51,300
realm of podcasting right so well we can talk about that more offline yeah I just

1470
01:52:51,300 --> 01:52:55,580
hit 42 by the way I really truly think it's just a matter of time before I'm

1471
01:52:55,940 --> 01:53:00,340

1487
01:53:55,380 --> 01:53:59,300
live dog network calm come on no Gus says I still have games that I bought

1488
01:53:59,300 --> 01:54:02,620
during last year's Black Friday that I haven't played you know a lot of people

1489
01:54:02,620 --> 01:54:07,100
say oh this is the year I'm gonna really dig into my backlog and actually play

1490
01:54:07,100 --> 01:54:11,380
more games what do you think about gaming wise right now Loki well I have

1491
01:54:11,380 --> 01:54:15,660
a backlog that's for sure of games I need to play I mean even as both recent

1492
01:54:15,660 --> 01:54:21,700
South Park the fracture butthole I haven't touched yet bought it it's an

1493
01:54:21,700 --> 01:54:29,460
assault time lady it mm-hmm yeah I don't know gaming wise I would like to

1494
01:54:29,460 --> 01:54:34,940
work on my game some more at some point I just I don't know what I want to start

1495
01:54:34,940 --> 01:54:38,500
I mean cuz I was working on one thing and I just kind of got bored with it

1496
01:54:38,500 --> 01:54:42,380
like I want to I need to find something that could just finish quickly that

1497
01:54:42,380 --> 01:54:47,220
doesn't get like ridiculously involved because I think once I finish some games

1498
01:54:47,220 --> 01:54:52,100
it'll be easier to stick with it longer it's just right now it just I over

1499
01:54:52,100 --> 01:54:55,260
scope everything and it just gets ridiculous and then I hit a wall with

1500
01:54:55,260 --> 01:54:59,940
like oh I can't figure one thing out and then I end up quitting like I happen

1501
01:54:59,940 --> 01:55:04,020
with like I was designing a Lego thing and I needed the design because it's

1502
01:55:04,020 --> 01:55:09,300
based off a real thing and so these tables are cubicles or deaths or

1503
01:55:09,300 --> 01:55:12,060
whatever that are in there are triangular they're like shaped like

1504
01:55:12,060 --> 01:55:17,140
three boomerangs set next to each other you can't fucking make that in Legos

1505
01:55:17,140 --> 01:55:21,820
at the scale that was doing it I spent weeks on that trying to solve that

1506
01:55:21,820 --> 01:55:27,700
problem and I just I couldn't get past it and then it just is time wasted and

1507
01:55:27,700 --> 01:55:30,180
that's kind of like where I run into with like these games and stuff it's

1508
01:55:30,180 --> 01:55:35,260
like I hit a wall with something that I can't do or something I can't figure out

1509
01:55:35,260 --> 01:55:39,740
and I waste tons of time on it and I get burnt out on it and it's just because

1510
01:55:39,740 --> 01:55:43,300
I'm not making any progress it's a small you have to probably commit to smaller

1511
01:55:43,300 --> 01:55:48,740
pry I want to it but small projects are boring as well but I need to give it at

1512
01:55:48,740 --> 01:55:52,880
least you'll finish one I understand that but I don't I don't know I had to

1513
01:55:52,880 --> 01:55:57,960
figure out what I want to do so it's just more of that and then I have to die

1514
01:55:57,960 --> 01:56:03,900
it so I don't get me started on that so I I do need to do that and I want to get

1515
01:56:03,900 --> 01:56:09,260
back in the DDR fact actually I won an auction today I could kick myself there

1516
01:56:09,260 --> 01:56:17,540
was there was some DDR pad stuff that was around here that was really cheap

1517
01:56:17,540 --> 01:56:22,780
and I let it like got bid on and I forgot the bid on it and stuff and I

1518
01:56:22,780 --> 01:56:28,700
could have won that but no I bought I have a set of arcade plates at home the

1519
01:56:28,700 --> 01:56:34,740
actual like Lexan and not Lexan the polycarbonate like actual arrow panels

1520
01:56:34,740 --> 01:56:38,900
so I have one set of those and I wanted to so I bought another set they don't

1521
01:56:38,940 --> 01:56:44,220
match and the other set it's not the you know two and two it's like three and one

1522
01:56:44,220 --> 01:56:52,100
but whatever as long as it works so now I have those I have parts to build new

1523
01:56:52,100 --> 01:56:55,980
pads but I have to design those from scratch as well because it's gonna be a

1524
01:56:55,980 --> 01:57:01,760
completely new design so we'll see if I get around to that ever to clean the

1525
01:57:01,760 --> 01:57:05,780
garage first Bobby black wolf with a witty little commentary here in chat at

1526
01:57:05,780 --> 01:57:09,500
live.vog network.com says finishing games is boring starting them is fun

1527
01:57:09,500 --> 01:57:12,740
that's why most people never finish their games and why most kickstarters

1528
01:57:12,740 --> 01:57:17,340
fail that's why me doing the show is fun me editing the show and posting it is

1529
01:57:17,340 --> 01:57:22,180
boring that's uh well Bobby you know my philosophy is that's why I don't edit

1530
01:57:22,180 --> 01:57:28,820
and and some other podcasters like to roast for this whole thing but I don't

1531
01:57:28,820 --> 01:57:31,860
want to be I don't want to be petty but I know you know I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm

1532
01:57:31,860 --> 01:57:36,060
gonna because at the same time I also got Ross it roasted by podcasters not

1533
01:57:36,060 --> 01:57:43,300
that long ago about why aren't you on patreon and well well okay I don't want

1534
01:57:43,300 --> 01:57:46,260
to have to deliver on all the stupid things whether you didn't did you hear

1535
01:57:46,260 --> 01:57:49,300
about the patreon controversy this we know what happened in the price they

1536
01:57:49,300 --> 01:57:52,580
change their pricing structure has people up in arms so but anyway I don't

1537
01:57:52,580 --> 01:57:56,420
want to repeat that whole thing but anyway just sometimes I just I just got

1538
01:57:56,420 --> 01:58:00,340
a march to the beat of my own drum and I don't if you want to do patreon that is

1539
01:58:00,340 --> 01:58:04,700
fucking rad you do what works for you I support that that's awesome you know but

1540
01:58:04,700 --> 01:58:08,820
I'm gonna do me you know what though hmm I don't think I would be opposed to

1541
01:58:08,820 --> 01:58:14,220
doing like a donation I take the biddies on Twitch so and that's cool you know

1542
01:58:14,220 --> 01:58:18,620
especially but I do but yet it does bring those feelings of guilt when it's

1543
01:58:18,620 --> 01:58:24,700
like Rob you haven't streamed in like two weeks but it's like I just if I keep

1544
01:58:24,700 --> 01:58:27,460
putting myself out there like that I'm gonna go fucking nuts you know so

1545
01:58:27,460 --> 01:58:30,780
sometimes I just can't do it I would still I'm gonna put the call out right

1546
01:58:30,780 --> 01:58:34,860
now because I've wanted to do this for a little while and I didn't have enough

1547
01:58:34,860 --> 01:58:42,220
material mm-hmm if anybody out there has pictures from being with us or pictures

1548
01:58:42,220 --> 01:58:46,460
of you guys what have we ever been out there in public hardly ever well I was

1549
01:58:46,460 --> 01:58:49,980
once in a great while I've met some of the listeners in Alabama sack indie

1550
01:58:49,980 --> 01:58:55,340
arcade you know dragon call your I see people dragon or any just pictures of

1551
01:58:55,340 --> 01:58:58,780
yourself that you want to you know add in a little bit of something to

1552
01:58:58,780 --> 01:59:01,740
contribute to it I'm still pointing to put together a kind of an art book in

1553
01:59:01,740 --> 01:59:05,700
history book so if anyone has anything they want to contribute to it you send

1554
01:59:05,700 --> 01:59:10,340
it to the mailbag okay that picture of me in New York like over ten years ago

1555
01:59:10,340 --> 01:59:14,700
at this point I have one of you and me when I still had like that kind of hot

1556
01:59:14,700 --> 01:59:22,620
fuchsia red hair and I was probably thin and had on my hair huh no comment yes

1557
01:59:22,620 --> 01:59:28,420
it's fine a little more ginger it was a little more ginger let's see over at

1558
01:59:28,420 --> 01:59:32,540
live.vog network.com Bobby Black Wolf says there's an animal crossing animal

1559
01:59:32,540 --> 01:59:37,700
that calls me bitty I think her Rob every time oh there you go all right we

1560
01:59:37,700 --> 01:59:41,700
got more video game stuff to get into rapid-fire news Loki yeah so it's that

1561
01:59:41,700 --> 01:59:45,740
time of year where we can announce more delays that's right some games that

1562
01:59:45,740 --> 01:59:50,300
you're looking forward to in the first half of next year well they're gonna be

1563
01:59:50,300 --> 01:59:54,820
a little later so all of these happen to be from Ubisoft starting off Far Cry

1564
01:59:54,820 --> 01:59:59,420
5 which was scheduled originally for February it's now coming out March 27

1565
01:59:59,420 --> 02:00:05,500
2018 the crew 2 is gonna be out later next year as well and there apparently

1566
02:00:05,500 --> 02:00:10,940
was an unannounced game that they were gonna have coming out but I guess that's

1567
02:00:10,940 --> 02:00:18,380
scheduled now for financial year 2018 2019 which is between April and March of

1568
02:00:18,380 --> 02:00:27,300
2019 so yeah that's kind of lame Far Cry looked interesting but yeah a month

1569
02:00:27,300 --> 02:00:31,700
that's not it's not a big that's nothing you know what it's nothing get it right

1570
02:00:31,700 --> 02:00:37,940
so finally at long last the time has come where everybody that was hoping

1571
02:00:37,940 --> 02:00:43,740
that someday we'd be able to unlock jetpacks in Grand Theft Auto 5 well now

1572
02:00:43,740 --> 02:00:48,340
thanks to the brand new Grand Theft Auto online doomsday heists you'll be able

1573
02:00:48,340 --> 02:00:52,140
to actually get jetpacks and so they're actually gonna take place inside Mount

1574
02:00:52,140 --> 02:00:58,020
Chiliad they've got a bunch of new events going on along with that so it's

1575
02:00:58,020 --> 02:01:03,220
coming out actually on December 12th and with that they've got you know jetpacks

1576
02:01:03,220 --> 02:01:09,500
there's even like a flying car that I saw submersible car and lots of new

1577
02:01:09,500 --> 02:01:15,860
vehicles so games getting more ridiculous as it is was it like okay so

1578
02:01:15,860 --> 02:01:19,020
that helicopter looks like there's something from airwolf that that car

1579
02:01:19,020 --> 02:01:22,700
looks like it's from Jean doesn't play the airwolf theme song yeah you need to

1580
02:01:22,700 --> 02:01:29,060
find us some airwolf now Rob does it does it play the airwolf NES game no it

1581
02:01:29,060 --> 02:01:33,220
doesn't but yeah it looks interesting so the whole premise is apparently a mill a

1582
02:01:33,220 --> 02:01:38,180
billionaire tech mogul and idealistic intelligence agent and a socially

1583
02:01:38,180 --> 02:01:42,140
awkward conspiracy theorist and a neurotic supercomputer have been forced

1584
02:01:42,140 --> 02:01:48,420
into an unlikely alliance to save San Andreas from total annihilation as an

1585
02:01:48,420 --> 02:01:53,420
apocalyptic threats mount from enemies unknown you and your criminal crew are

1586
02:01:53,420 --> 02:01:59,300
enlisted to untangle mysteries and eradicate threats spanning from the

1587
02:01:59,300 --> 02:02:04,300
bustling streets of downtown Los Santos to the ocean floor and all the way to

1588
02:02:04,300 --> 02:02:09,220
the inner depths of Mount Chiliad an epic new online adventure that's it I'm

1589
02:02:09,220 --> 02:02:15,620
gonna make a proposition right now what Loki's rapid-fire news to airwolf

1590
02:02:22,820 --> 02:02:27,540
wait what why the fuck if they rebooted like every third okay I don't know

1591
02:02:27,540 --> 02:02:31,580
writers they rebooted like with all those fucking reboots they've done how

1592
02:02:31,580 --> 02:02:39,740
have they not rebooted airwolf and the love boat how are they not rebooted

1593
02:02:39,740 --> 02:02:43,820
because I was okay so you know how this is one of those nights at OLR right

1594
02:02:43,820 --> 02:02:47,420
because here I go I'm gonna take it to a place I'm gonna take it to a place so

1595
02:02:47,420 --> 02:02:50,460
you know how sometimes you just fall down those random YouTube pits or

1596
02:02:50,460 --> 02:02:53,020
sometimes right we like you're watching all these different youtubes do you know

1597
02:02:53,020 --> 02:02:57,740
the you know the random YouTube pit I fell into the other day 80 shows clips

1598
02:02:57,740 --> 02:03:04,900
of Charo on various television shows because Charo is the best like sir try

1599
02:03:04,900 --> 02:03:09,380
and she's still doing her shit coochie coochie coo it started I think with one

1600
02:03:09,380 --> 02:03:13,940
of my friends posted Charo I'm like the Pee Wee Christmas special where she was

1601
02:03:13,940 --> 02:03:17,420
singing Feliz Navidad right that whole thing and then that led to a whole thing

1602
02:03:17,420 --> 02:03:21,100
where I was watching Charo on Hollywood Squares and then of course Charlie

1603
02:03:21,100 --> 02:03:26,340
Charo on the love boat and she was on Drag Race yeah I was I was there at the

1604
02:03:26,340 --> 02:03:31,740
finale she was that I have seen Charo in person that is something I can cross

1605
02:03:31,740 --> 02:03:35,980
off my buddy I'm like the celebrity apprentice or like god I hope not I

1606
02:03:35,980 --> 02:03:38,940
don't think she was the one where they all lived together a while the surreal

1607
02:03:38,940 --> 02:03:44,060
the surreal life that's right yes she what Charo was on that yes do you know

1608
02:03:44,060 --> 02:03:47,600
what my dream is is there somebody out there they could have Charo tape a very

1609
02:03:47,600 --> 02:03:53,040
special introduction for orange on radio like I just like before I die is that a

1610
02:03:53,040 --> 02:03:57,280
thing that could happen like Charo does the intro like Jason I love you you do

1611
02:03:57,280 --> 02:04:00,920
wonderful things for the show you but but just for why I think Jason would

1612
02:04:00,920 --> 02:04:04,760
even understand for one week can Charo do the intro do they have like a

1613
02:04:04,760 --> 02:04:12,420
convention that she would go to I don't know we need actually maybe she does go

1614
02:04:12,420 --> 02:04:16,840
to drag I am going to drag con next year that's something that's gonna have to

1615
02:04:16,840 --> 02:04:21,840
happen all right that's the show 100 Matt says Charo is all over the I love

1616
02:04:21,840 --> 02:04:27,120
the blank and other vh1 shows oh my god they said that they did reboot the love

1617
02:04:27,120 --> 02:04:34,120
boat in the 2000 early 2000s I don't even remember that I remember once I

1618
02:04:34,120 --> 02:04:39,880
like speed too so I mean that's true when I used to do live-action vampire

1619
02:04:39,880 --> 02:04:44,800
roleplay yes I did vampire LARP uh-huh we had a group of us who walk around in

1620
02:04:44,800 --> 02:04:49,400
our theme song was the blood boat we had lyrics to it and everything I don't

1621
02:04:49,520 --> 02:04:54,520
remember how all of them went but it was pretty funny Oh LARPing hey let's move

1622
02:04:54,520 --> 02:04:59,520
on I got some more news for you yeah let's talk a little bit about a game

1623
02:04:59,520 --> 02:05:02,960
that has been announced with some alpha footage out there on YouTube called

1624
02:05:02,960 --> 02:05:07,960
super retro maker so this is somebody taking Mario maker type of thing to the

1625
02:05:07,960 --> 02:05:12,800
next level you can make stages inspired by I'm using that my quote II fingers

1626
02:05:12,800 --> 02:05:18,600
inspired by games like Megaman Contra Strider Castlevania and more because if

1627
02:05:18,600 --> 02:05:21,560
you actually look at the trailer look at these characters it's not quite

1628
02:05:21,560 --> 02:05:26,920
Megaman it's like you know Maga Mon or something

1629
02:05:26,920 --> 02:05:36,320
Danky Kang Princess Zordla Zorlda Sornik the hedge goat Santa Santa

1630
02:05:36,320 --> 02:05:42,480
Santa the hedge goat and all that stuff and then don't forget Samus's Celtic

1631
02:05:42,480 --> 02:05:49,320
cousin Seamus are on Seamus and lonk so anyway so in super retro maker you have

1632
02:05:49,320 --> 02:05:51,840
all these characters in the game and like you can actually build like

1633
02:05:51,840 --> 02:05:55,920
basically like looks like a Metroidvania type of game if you want or you can make

1634
02:05:55,920 --> 02:05:59,880
games inspired by you know other types of 80s games I think it's really cool it

1635
02:05:59,880 --> 02:06:02,880
is something that's gonna be coming to steam they say it's gonna has a

1636
02:06:02,880 --> 02:06:06,920
projected release in 2018 so you can check out the trailer there at super

1637
02:06:06,920 --> 02:06:10,520
retro maker I was hoping when dark to see opposed to that new story for us I

1638
02:06:10,520 --> 02:06:13,800
was hoping that that meant the game was already out but sadly no they're just

1639
02:06:13,800 --> 02:06:17,720
announcing that that's a thing that's gonna happen but kind of cool something

1640
02:06:17,720 --> 02:06:22,960
that may happen a little sooner is the US release of DJ Max respect this game

1641
02:06:22,960 --> 02:06:27,160
has already been out overseas for a little bit I know Shane downloaded it on

1642
02:06:27,160 --> 02:06:30,960
his PlayStation 4 so I've played it but it is nice to see that it is going to

1643
02:06:30,960 --> 02:06:34,880
get a digital released anyway here in the US and that's coming up early next

1644
02:06:34,880 --> 02:06:38,480
year I don't know if we know the exact date but if you want to get in the know

1645
02:06:38,480 --> 02:06:46,440
you can actually be a DJ Max respect partner as part of their partner program

1646
02:06:46,440 --> 02:06:51,160
if you get into the partner program you would get a complimentary download code

1647
02:06:51,160 --> 02:06:55,640
you get an unlock all music code for event mode you get the chance to play

1648
02:06:55,640 --> 02:07:00,200
and stream with a developer and you get a DJ Max emote icon which is some type

1649
02:07:00,200 --> 02:07:04,160
of emoji you can use and I guess some type of ps4 plate I don't know if

1650
02:07:04,160 --> 02:07:06,840
that's like a replacement little front plate or something that you can do with

1651
02:07:06,840 --> 02:07:11,280
that but that's pretty cool but of course you can stream and you just don't

1652
02:07:11,280 --> 02:07:14,160
want to have inappropriate material with all that stuff but definitely they're

1653
02:07:14,160 --> 02:07:19,000
trying to reach out to some of you twitch people to get you to basically

1654
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:22,800
advertise their game but hey that's how that's how it works in the year 2018

1655
02:07:22,800 --> 02:07:26,760
when this game will be out yep yep all right let's move on Dark

1656
02:07:26,760 --> 02:07:30,800
Sakura um well there's gonna be a live-action Pokemon movie and Ryan

1657
02:07:30,800 --> 02:07:39,920
Reynolds is Pikachu oh I don't get it well I detective Pikachu sorry it's not

1658
02:07:39,920 --> 02:07:45,800
Danny DeVito but I feel like we're gonna get Ryan Reynolds as Danny DeVito as

1659
02:07:45,800 --> 02:07:49,520
detective Pikachu Ryan Reynolds ain't stupid he knows what the internet wants

1660
02:07:49,520 --> 02:07:54,360
and he gives you just they want he does give him what he's gonna be like dead

1661
02:07:54,360 --> 02:07:58,360
pull at you I'm kind of fine with it yeah I still wanted anything like if

1662
02:07:58,360 --> 02:08:02,880
Danny DeVito was gonna be whiny and not gonna do it then fine Ryan Reynolds is

1663
02:08:02,880 --> 02:08:08,640
you know I was maybe number two on the list so sure I just remember when he was

1664
02:08:08,640 --> 02:08:11,920
on that two guys in a pizza place show that was fucking garbage but I'm glad

1665
02:08:11,920 --> 02:08:15,320
his career has come along honestly we just need to have like several Pokemon

1666
02:08:15,320 --> 02:08:18,620
and just get the whole cast if it's always sunny in Philadelphia to just do

1667
02:08:18,620 --> 02:08:22,260
the voices there that's my dream movie all right I need to respond to act

1668
02:08:22,260 --> 02:08:26,200
Efton check his act Efton chat over at live dog vog network comm says why do

1669
02:08:26,240 --> 02:08:31,440
people want Danny DeVito as Pikachu it's the worst choice act Efton I feel like

1670
02:08:31,440 --> 02:08:35,920
you're not watching it's always sunny in Philadelphia and you need to watch the

1671
02:08:35,920 --> 02:08:40,680
show they have to understand they have a clip of detective Pikachu with Danny

1672
02:08:40,680 --> 02:08:44,760
DeVito from it's always sunny in Philadelphia perfect I mean perfect you

1673
02:08:44,760 --> 02:08:47,840
know go watch that clip only thing I know if it's always sunny in Philadelphia

1674
02:08:47,840 --> 02:08:52,040
is because I watch binging with Babish huh who does like recreations of stuff

1675
02:08:52,040 --> 02:08:56,480
from TV and movies and he did the rum-soaked ham okay it's always sunny is

1676
02:08:56,480 --> 02:08:59,480
one of those shows that like when it's bad it's pretty fucking bad but when

1677
02:08:59,480 --> 02:09:06,560
it's good it's really fucking funny like some of those episodes I like I hurt

1678
02:09:06,560 --> 02:09:10,780
from laughing so hard and that rarely happens to me I just don't find humor

1679
02:09:10,780 --> 02:09:14,040
funny but I'm not afraid to say some episodes of South Park and I know some

1680
02:09:14,040 --> 02:09:17,440
people don't like South Park but you know so and it South Park I would say

1681
02:09:17,440 --> 02:09:19,480
there's another one of those shows that when it's bad it's pretty fucking bad

1682
02:09:19,680 --> 02:09:24,600
but when South Park's funny it is fucking funny but anyway that's just my

1683
02:09:24,600 --> 02:09:30,440
my thoughts on the matter there okay I'll post the link in chat that's

1684
02:09:30,440 --> 02:09:34,920
basically act after saying I've seen the clip it's the worst choice I like Danny

1685
02:09:34,920 --> 02:09:41,960
DeVito blah blah blah blah you're watching again so it is done all right

1686
02:09:41,960 --> 02:09:51,760
anyway Jamie yeah whatever I can't so other news streets of rage is also out

1687
02:09:51,760 --> 02:10:00,120

1688
02:10:00,120 --> 02:10:07,120
play on iOS or Android and you can beat them up with some bare knuckle which was

1689
02:10:07,120 --> 02:10:11,800
of course streets of rage over here and that's it I have nothing more to be

1690
02:10:11,800 --> 02:10:16,040
rapping about all right then let's uh well I'm I think this segment will go by

1691
02:10:16,040 --> 02:10:19,200

1692

02:12:29,920 --> 02:12:33,560
I mentioned a minute ago also on the Vita this week as well as demon gaze too

1717
02:12:33,560 --> 02:12:37,720
because they love the Vita in Japan still even though it's mostly ignored

1718
02:12:37,720 --> 02:12:42,280
here although I did see like read only memories got its Vita release there's

1719
02:12:42,280 --> 02:12:45,840
like quite a few games coming out on the yeah yeah PSX they did kind of drop a

1720
02:12:45,920 --> 02:12:50,560
few video games which is really strong like a more powerful Vita and just kind

1721
02:12:50,560 --> 02:12:54,000
of go with that I know it's so weird how Sony would walk away from either or

1722
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:57,480
something like that yeah I would never I'm still never gonna understand why

1723
02:12:57,480 --> 02:13:01,480
Sony just like completely abandoned that thing but I guess not everything is

1724
02:13:01,480 --> 02:13:04,960
gonna make sense quickly checking I didn't really see anything on the switch

1725
02:13:04,960 --> 02:13:10,640
on the 3ds you can get a monster hunter stories twin pack so just basically a

1726
02:13:10,640 --> 02:13:15,280
repackaging of that on the 3ds there you go how about the UK dark soccer

1727
02:13:15,280 --> 02:13:20,560
there's nothing on my list all right I mean I'm actually double-checking other

1728
02:13:20,560 --> 02:13:27,280
lists and there's like a fallout VR oh sure yeah for pre-order sorry for order

1729
02:13:27,280 --> 02:13:32,440
on December 12th I'm not used to reading this list player unknowns

1730
02:13:32,440 --> 02:13:43,240
Battlegrounds under the night in birth exe latest yeah nothing much all right

1731
02:13:43,240 --> 02:13:51,080
let us now go to the mailbag every week you guys send us emails and we answer

1732
02:13:51,080 --> 02:13:54,880
participate at orange lounge radio comm is the place to send emails and we

1733
02:13:54,880 --> 02:13:59,920
actually have a few tonight sorry you may not be prepared for this order but I

1734
02:13:59,920 --> 02:14:03,160
know that why we are sent one at the end of the shirt like while we were live

1735
02:14:03,160 --> 02:14:06,440
last week but the show was so short we never got to it so I don't know if you

1736
02:14:06,440 --> 02:14:10,480
want to do that one first I already had it well you read my mind you should do

1737
02:14:10,480 --> 02:14:16,600
that more often hello LR I was kind of surprised to hear Rob's take on user

1738
02:14:16,600 --> 02:14:21,000
reviews specifically how he didn't put a whole lot of stock into them customer

1739
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:25,040
reviews have been heavily influencing my purchasing decisions for many years now

1740
02:14:25,040 --> 02:14:29,680
first place I really paid attention to them actually was game facts I didn't

1741
02:14:29,680 --> 02:14:33,400
pay a ton of attention to the score out of 10 what I looked at were the specific

1742
02:14:33,400 --> 02:14:37,320
details in the reviews themselves by looking at both those specific details

1743
02:14:37,320 --> 02:14:41,240
in the general consensus across several reviews I could generally determine

1744
02:14:41,240 --> 02:14:45,580
whether I should spend my money on a particular game or not in the end I also

1745
02:14:45,580 --> 02:14:49,760
wrote several detailed reviews for game facts and one review of the month twice

1746
02:14:49,760 --> 02:14:56,560
I use the same practice today across team Amazon Newegg and even Yelp I look

1747
02:14:56,560 --> 02:15:00,920
at multiple reviews use the same combination of details and consensus to

1748
02:15:00,920 --> 02:15:05,040
form an opinion for myself you can also learn a lot of things about a game or

1749
02:15:05,040 --> 02:15:08,720
product or restaurant from a customer review the only able to find from the

1750
02:15:08,720 --> 02:15:12,640
back of a box from an online menu things like the controls feel floaty but still

1751
02:15:12,640 --> 02:15:17,100
responsive or the campaign only lasts four hours or the filling is really

1752
02:15:17,100 --> 02:15:20,360
spicy or the manufacturer says the battery last eight hours but actually

1753
02:15:20,360 --> 02:15:25,920
lasted ten I guess what I'm saying is I would I've been relying on customer

1754
02:15:25,920 --> 02:15:29,640
reviews is a good source of information and I would personally give them a high

1755
02:15:29,640 --> 02:15:34,880
rating probably a 4.7 out of 5 but I understand that people can disagree with

1756
02:15:34,880 --> 02:15:38,720
me and that's fine I will look forward to the end of tonight's show when Rob

1757
02:15:38,720 --> 02:15:41,760
will end it by saying a nice five-star review on iTunes may or may not actually

1758
02:15:41,760 --> 02:15:45,720
go a long way since it's an online review whatever look at this bitch

1759
02:15:45,720 --> 02:15:48,920
trying to come for me on my own damn show let me finish reading the email

1760
02:15:48,920 --> 02:15:55,040
rub I'm kidding of course and I stand by my five-star review of olr oh I have a

02:16:20,440 --> 02:16:24,340
respond and I I know he said he was kidding and obviously he's not really a

1767
02:16:24,380 --> 02:16:28,620
bitch but I'm gonna I'm gonna if he came here to play I'm gonna throw down no

1768
02:16:28,620 --> 02:16:31,660
that's coming for you I'd catch you that's right if he gonna come for me

1769
02:16:31,660 --> 02:16:36,500
then he might be ready cuz my nails have been sharpened so anyway no here's the

1770
02:16:36,500 --> 02:16:39,860
theater here's the thing I was feeling very attacked well I think yes right I

1771
02:16:39,860 --> 02:16:43,540
just came here to have a good time I'm feeling very attacked no here's the

1772
02:16:43,540 --> 02:16:48,300
thing with the customer reviews for me there is it and again for me you

1773
02:16:48,300 --> 02:16:51,500
explained how they work for you and that's fine you know again I don't I'm

1774
02:16:51,540 --> 02:16:54,900
not gonna tell people how to spend their money but for me I don't really care

1775
02:16:54,900 --> 02:16:58,620
what a lot of strangers think about things because I know a lot of this

1776
02:16:58,620 --> 02:17:03,580
campaign shit goes on to downvote games and things like that however do I put

1777
02:17:03,580 --> 02:17:08,620
stock in what my friends on Twitter say about a game abso-fucking-lutely and I

1778
02:17:08,620 --> 02:17:13,100
have swayed been swayed on the fence one way or the other based on some of the

1779
02:17:13,100 --> 02:17:17,660
reactions of people I know and how they react to particular games and things

1780
02:17:17,660 --> 02:17:21,420
like that when it comes to the iTunes reviews and why I beg for them at the

1781
02:17:21,420 --> 02:17:24,900
end of every show even though you said just kidding I am gonna just explain for

1782
02:17:24,900 --> 02:17:29,780
people who go well he does make a point here's the thing iTunes really does weigh

1783
02:17:29,780 --> 02:17:33,900
that stuff like and it will help with visibility if you have more positive

1784
02:17:33,900 --> 02:17:37,260
reviews and more interactions that are going on with your show and stuff so

1785
02:17:37,260 --> 02:17:42,540
whether I put any stock in him or not I just know the reality is that then why I

1786
02:17:42,540 --> 02:17:46,020
beg for that stuff and why any podcaster you're listening to is begging for that

1787
02:17:46,020 --> 02:17:52,060
stuff really is because iTunes the the one big big problem with iTunes right

1788
02:17:52,060 --> 02:17:56,580
now is that it really can be a dumping ground for podcasts and what I mean by

1789
02:17:56,580 --> 02:18:01,220
that is there's a lot of shows that I look that are in like the top 200 they

1790
02:18:01,220 --> 02:18:04,540
haven't fucking put a new show out since like February or March these shows are

1791
02:18:04,540 --> 02:18:09,860
like done you know but iTunes still continues to kind of put them where they

1792
02:18:09,860 --> 02:18:13,540
are because they don't weigh them by like how long they've like the last

1793
02:18:13,540 --> 02:18:17,540
release of it yeah you would think you would think but I don't know anyway so I

1794
02:18:17,540 --> 02:18:21,060
kind of that's that's for Apple to figure out with iTunes and I understand

1795
02:18:21,060 --> 02:18:24,900
that podcasting is a tricky thing and then when it comes to Spotify like I

1796
02:18:24,900 --> 02:18:29,220
really would love to get on Spotify podcast but with Spotify podcast like

1797
02:18:29,220 --> 02:18:32,820
you pretty much have to be through lips in to get through that whole thing and

1798
02:18:32,820 --> 02:18:38,700
so that feels kind of super limiting so I don't know and then we used to be on

1799
02:18:38,700 --> 02:18:42,540
stitcher and I'm gonna tell you why I took us off of stitcher in case you

1800
02:18:42,540 --> 02:18:45,660
weren't around to hear that I took us off of stitcher because stitcher when

1801
02:18:45,660 --> 02:18:48,720
they had their buyout and then they got bought again they were having so many

1802
02:18:48,720 --> 02:18:52,660
technical problems that our show was not updating on stitcher when we were

1803
02:18:52,660 --> 02:18:55,820
putting out new episodes and this was gone for months and I sent emails and

1804
02:18:55,820 --> 02:18:58,740
they went on responded to us I said you know what I'm pulling our show from

1805
02:18:58,740 --> 02:19:02,620
stitcher because it's not fair that we're getting emails asking oh did you

1806
02:19:02,620 --> 02:19:05,320
guys do a new show this week why can't I listen to your show and it's like I'm

1807
02:19:05,320 --> 02:19:09,480
here promoting stitcher and they can't like why can't they just directly tap

1808
02:19:09,480 --> 02:19:13,440
into the feed and I understand it's one of the things that it might be fixed now

1809
02:19:13,440 --> 02:19:19,400
but I've done gone and moved on so that's why we're not on stitcher but

1810
02:19:19,400 --> 02:19:24,240
just about everywhere else you can get podcasts we're there so or you can just

1811
02:19:24,240 --> 02:19:28,140
go straight to vog network calm and listen right there in the browser same

1812
02:19:28,140 --> 02:19:31,720
thing I think even an orange launch radio calm I think I like using use that

1813
02:19:31,720 --> 02:19:35,960
ten-year-old technology to listen to my podcast cuz I have an Android phone I

1814
02:19:35,960 --> 02:19:42,280
use the Google Play in the music thing and do my podcast through there and it

1815
02:19:42,280 --> 02:19:49,400
works we're always updated no all right so so there you go so anyway with the

1816
02:19:49,400 --> 02:19:54,120
user reviews I think I kind of hopefully clarified that I I will listen to users

1817
02:19:54,120 --> 02:19:57,960
when I know them but when they're just strangers on the internet I'm kind of

1818
02:19:57,960 --> 02:20:03,360
like I don't I don't you know I just I just don't put a lot of stock in them

1819
02:20:03,360 --> 02:20:07,640
it's not to say I've ignored them a hundred percent of the time but I do

1820
02:20:07,640 --> 02:20:11,200
this if to be fair this isn't just with games I do the same thing with Yelp

1821
02:20:11,200 --> 02:20:14,880
reviews because I know that people will go on Yelp and they're only gonna say

1822
02:20:14,880 --> 02:20:18,160
the bad things or they're friends with the owner and they're only gonna say the

1823
02:20:18,160 --> 02:20:24,880
good things so there's a lot that I read on Yelp that I go hmm I'm more likely to

1824
02:20:24,880 --> 02:20:28,640
believe a three-star review on Yelp than anything else well here's what I

1825
02:20:28,640 --> 02:20:33,040
normally do is I look at what like how in-depth the review is and what it the

1826
02:20:33,040 --> 02:20:37,120
criteria is so like especially if it's like a product review like I want to

1827
02:20:37,120 --> 02:20:42,160
know what it was that was broken on air why you didn't like it and like give the

1828
02:20:42,160 --> 02:20:45,520
positives and negatives and that type of thing because if you're just like well I

1829
02:20:45,520 --> 02:20:51,200
didn't like it cuz it arrived effective that doesn't help me because that can

1830
02:20:51,200 --> 02:20:56,600
happen but I don't know it you just have to kind of look at it and a lot of them

1831
02:20:56,600 --> 02:21:01,960
are like yeah it was awesome okay why was it awesome because it was

1832
02:21:01,960 --> 02:21:07,880
awesome all right thanks for the email nonetheless why why are it was it was a

1833
02:21:07,880 --> 02:21:14,160
fun debate and I do still really want to play your game so let's do that I was

1834
02:21:14,160 --> 02:21:18,200
dream your game you feel let me but I understand you may not be ready for that

1835
02:21:18,200 --> 02:21:24,800
next email hello peoples in what ways are the movie fruitvale station in the

1836
02:21:24,800 --> 02:21:29,400
game present evil 7 similar both are projects that receive lots of praise the

1837
02:21:29,400 --> 02:21:33,240
year they came out both are projects that first came out in January of the

1838
02:21:33,240 --> 02:21:37,080
year they were released when the end of the year awards came out in each of

1839
02:21:37,080 --> 02:21:40,640
these projects perspective fields both projects fail to receive a nomination in

1840
02:21:40,640 --> 02:21:45,720
the category best media form why did neither of these projects garner such

1841
02:21:45,720 --> 02:21:50,080
nominations that can be attributed to both of these projects being released in

1842
02:21:50,080 --> 02:21:54,400
January and by the end of the year the people who put together the awards

1843
02:21:54,400 --> 02:21:58,640
forgetting how impactful these projects were also because people suck resident

1844
02:21:58,640 --> 02:22:02,560
evil 7 for game of the year fruitvale station for best picture in 2013 stay

1845
02:22:02,560 --> 02:22:08,480
black entertainment no I agree I forgot resident evil 7 came out this year yeah

1846
02:22:08,480 --> 02:22:11,960
I totally forgot about resident evil 7 this year as well but what here here's

1847
02:22:11,960 --> 02:22:18,400
my my real question did it really um was it was resident evil 7 really as good as

1848
02:22:18,400 --> 02:22:22,560
breath of the wild and Super Mario I know no but it probably was as good as

1849
02:22:22,560 --> 02:22:32,400
probably like what's the other one horizon zero dawn I mean it's probably

1850
02:22:32,400 --> 02:22:42,640
it's been a hard year forget I mean it's been it's been a hard year to rank games

1851
02:22:42,640 --> 02:22:46,720
because there's been a lot of good games that's that's a that's actually great

1852
02:22:46,720 --> 02:22:51,560
news to hear when something like resident evil 7 isn't up for game of the

1853
02:22:51,560 --> 02:22:55,320
year because there's that many good games to choose from in a way that's

1854
02:22:55,320 --> 02:22:59,160
kind of good news now fruit veals fruitvale station that's a whole nother

1855
02:22:59,160 --> 02:23:03,120
you know issue over there I believe though I just went to the wiki page real

1856
02:23:03,120 --> 02:23:07,640
quick as I was curious fruitvale station got its Sundance release in January and

1857
02:23:07,640 --> 02:23:11,600
then it got its wide release in July so you would think maybe people would

1858
02:23:11,600 --> 02:23:17,520
remember it more but when it comes to awards movies usually not always usually

1859
02:23:17,520 --> 02:23:21,420
those movies tend to come out towards the end of the year that's why you have

1860
02:23:21,420 --> 02:23:24,860
stuff like Lady Bird the disaster artist and these movies that they're

1861
02:23:24,860 --> 02:23:27,500
talking about getting awards are coming out towards the end of the year and

1862
02:23:27,500 --> 02:23:31,500
usually what happens because this is a January thing you get movies that come

1863
02:23:31,500 --> 02:23:36,060
out in like LA and New York in December to qualify for the Oscars but then they

1864
02:23:36,060 --> 02:23:40,220
get their wide release in January because not a lot of blockbuster movies

1865
02:23:40,220 --> 02:23:46,420
come out in January but you know earlier movies have been getting recognized I

1866
02:23:46,420 --> 02:23:50,860
think a little more often there's a lot of talk that get out is probably gonna

1867
02:23:50,860 --> 02:23:54,340
be a Best Picture nominee this year get out was so fucking good I haven't seen

1868
02:23:54,340 --> 02:23:57,740
you yet unfortunately I don't I have a lot of movies oh I mean I may need to

1869
02:23:57,740 --> 02:24:00,820
borrow it I hear it good yeah I hear it's good too and it probably is gonna

1870
02:24:00,820 --> 02:24:05,780
get a Best Picture nomination that movie came out kind of early for you know and

1871
02:24:05,780 --> 02:24:09,940
you know what hmm I think the thing about that movie is that it gets its

1872
02:24:09,940 --> 02:24:18,700
point across in such a a great way that you can't oh god that movie's just so

1873
02:24:18,700 --> 02:24:21,820
good it's one of my I would put that as one of my favorite movies of the year

1874
02:24:21,820 --> 02:24:26,700
yeah I think I don't I I highly doubt you're alone with that so I was trying

1875
02:24:26,700 --> 02:24:30,180
to see because I thought I found the past couple years we've had like Oscars

1876
02:24:30,180 --> 02:24:36,900
where movies that work that came out earlier in the year were actually

1877
02:24:36,900 --> 02:24:41,980
getting nominated but I can't remember I thought was in 2015 or 2016 we had

1878
02:24:41,980 --> 02:24:46,920
movies that were kind of released a little earlier in the year when did Mad

1879
02:24:46,920 --> 02:24:50,080
Max Fury Road come out cuz I got a Best Picture nominee that was like a summer

1880
02:24:50,080 --> 02:24:54,480
blockbuster yeah that was like yeah that's another movie but nobody nobody

1881
02:24:54,480 --> 02:24:58,840
expected I don't think anybody expected um I mean come on when you heard Mad Max

1882
02:24:58,840 --> 02:25:02,280
was getting like a sequel I think a lot of people are going I just hope Mel

1883
02:25:02,280 --> 02:25:06,480
Gibson has nothing to do with it which he didn't and then you know and turns

1884
02:25:06,480 --> 02:25:09,840
out the movie was that now that movie I did see and that movie was pretty

1885
02:25:09,840 --> 02:25:14,400
fucking badass and I don't even usually like action movies I haven't seen it

1886
02:25:14,440 --> 02:25:21,640
it's it's pretty fucking good I was very very impressed anyway let's move on next

1887
02:25:21,640 --> 02:25:29,080
email next email alright hold on there it is with the switch port of Outlast

1888
02:25:29,080 --> 02:25:32,920
announced I was thinking about the owner of a small arcade and toy shop

1889
02:25:32,920 --> 02:25:37,520
specifically the neutral zone in Chesterfield Mall in St. Louis and

1890
02:25:37,520 --> 02:25:41,900
asking him as well as you while Outlast, Amnesia, the multiplayer Dead by

1891
02:25:41,900 --> 02:25:46,060
Daylight and a myriad of games full of tension and jump scares have defined

1892
02:25:46,060 --> 02:25:50,660
YouTube's let's play channels most arcade games of the genre have been

1893
02:25:50,660 --> 02:25:54,600
action games with horror themes your ghosts and goblins your house of the

1894
02:25:54,600 --> 02:25:59,500
dead and so on for a few places where arcade games is still a thing what are

1895
02:25:59,500 --> 02:26:02,620
the chances of the cabinet that gives the same level of tension and

1896
02:26:02,620 --> 02:26:08,500
helplessness of the better computer games how would such an experience

1897
02:26:08,500 --> 02:26:11,980
translate to coin-op gaming what general audience design would you

1898
02:26:11,980 --> 02:26:17,300
suggest well if and that's from Robert M if you remember there were survival

1899
02:26:17,300 --> 02:26:22,700
horror games that like there was the whole gun survivor series you know there

1900
02:26:22,700 --> 02:26:29,500
was I guess not too many in the realm of scary but here's the problem is that in

1901
02:26:29,500 --> 02:26:33,820
arcades there's going to be a lot of noise and that noise is gonna take you

1902
02:26:33,820 --> 02:26:37,220
out of the experience a little bit because you know these places are

1903
02:26:37,220 --> 02:26:41,540
sometimes referred to as amusement centers so survival horror games aren't

1904
02:26:41,540 --> 02:26:45,860
always necessarily you know amusing and I think the reason why people have the

1905
02:26:45,860 --> 02:26:48,820
reactions that you see on youtubes and stuff and I know you know having

1906
02:26:48,820 --> 02:26:53,360
streamed some of those scary games like years ago when God what was that fucking

1907
02:26:53,360 --> 02:26:58,620
game that got me like to scream on and it wasn't even five nights as the other

1908
02:26:58,620 --> 02:27:02,460
was Slender Man okay that's the one I play and I was like oh my like I was

1909
02:27:02,460 --> 02:27:06,620
like crying it was so horrible you can't really replicate that in the arcade

1910
02:27:06,660 --> 02:27:10,660
because when I'm playing at home I have headphones on the lights are off maybe

1911
02:27:10,660 --> 02:27:14,620
and I'm in the zone looking at my monitor there's nothing really to break

1912
02:27:14,620 --> 02:27:17,780
that atmosphere but when you're at an arcade it's loud it's noisy there's

1913
02:27:17,780 --> 02:27:22,060
little kids running right through your game so I think it's harder to get in

1914
02:27:22,060 --> 02:27:26,420
that experience you know but like Jamie said there's been some like you know a

1915
02:27:26,420 --> 02:27:31,540
Silent Hill had an arcade game but it wasn't really scary it was just pew pew

1916
02:27:31,540 --> 02:27:35,180
pew shoot him up with a gun all the pyramid head and all the things from

1917
02:27:35,180 --> 02:27:38,500
Silent Hill wasn't really the same thing you can't mess with people's heads

1918
02:27:38,500 --> 02:27:42,500
and allowed arcade I mean truly and on top of that the whole point I mean in

1919
02:27:42,500 --> 02:27:48,060
the end with with coin up games is to make people put more coin in the game oh

1920
02:27:48,060 --> 02:27:52,260
that's that's a good point and if you poop scared out of you you're not gonna

1921
02:27:52,260 --> 02:27:55,220
want to do that no no no that's not really what I'm talking about you can't

1922
02:27:55,220 --> 02:28:01,180
build up the level of suspense needed especially if you were having to stop in

1923
02:28:01,180 --> 02:28:07,620
the experience to put another coin in just saying okay fair enough I think we

1924
02:28:07,620 --> 02:28:10,020
gave some good explanations at least I hope we did thanks for the email though

1925
02:28:10,020 --> 02:28:16,980
yeah because we're smart people we'd like to think we are so modest exactly

1926
02:28:16,980 --> 02:28:22,460
we're very humble too hello olr why are some people against emulation of older

1927
02:28:22,460 --> 02:28:28,380
games but on the other how many times do you really play said older game maybe

1928
02:28:28,540 --> 02:28:33,460
15 minutes after which the nostalgia has died down emulation is also often the

1929
02:28:33,460 --> 02:28:37,500
only chance to play an older arcade game anyway as always thank you for making

1930
02:28:37,500 --> 02:28:42,500
the podcast yours truly Fabrice from Belgium I personally don't have a

1931
02:28:42,500 --> 02:28:46,220
problem with it the only people who have a problem with it I think are number one

1932
02:28:46,220 --> 02:28:54,220
collectors who want to keep the value of their games higher I mean honestly enough

1933
02:28:54,220 --> 02:28:58,580
Dan and I are gonna start selling off the collection so that's fine the other

1934
02:28:58,580 --> 02:29:04,740
thing too I think goes with having the people who hold the licenses for some of

1935
02:29:04,740 --> 02:29:08,860
these games who might want to do like a best-of collection or make their money

1936
02:29:08,860 --> 02:29:15,980
selling you know those those like flashbacks and things like that so it

1937
02:29:15,980 --> 02:29:21,460
really is is coming back to you know who's got their hand in the pocket I

1938
02:29:21,580 --> 02:29:27,140
think with emulation sometimes you know well you know having the hardware

1939
02:29:27,140 --> 02:29:30,700
perfect thing is very important for some people but honestly I think the way that

1940
02:29:30,700 --> 02:29:34,460
services like virtual console and some of the you know official repackaging is

1941
02:29:34,460 --> 02:29:38,620
and stuff the way they do it is well enough especially for people to be able

1942
02:29:38,620 --> 02:29:41,900
to play games that maybe they missed the first time around they were too young to

1943
02:29:41,900 --> 02:29:47,900
play the first time around or what have you so emulation is great for that but

1944
02:29:47,900 --> 02:29:50,660
you do bring up a very good point and a lot of people do this with emulators is

1945
02:29:50,660 --> 02:29:55,020
that now when you have a buffet in front of you and you know the way some people

1946
02:29:55,020 --> 02:29:58,460
do emulators they'll download the emulator and let's say they download an

1947
02:29:58,460 --> 02:30:03,860
Atari 2600 emulator and then like how you can download like every single

1948
02:30:03,860 --> 02:30:11,060
Atari 2600 game ever fucking made would fit on like an old floppy disk probably

1949
02:30:11,060 --> 02:30:14,660
like those games were not very big right and there was only so many hundred of

1950
02:30:14,660 --> 02:30:18,900
them so my point is many people also download every fucking ROM when they

1951
02:30:18,900 --> 02:30:22,140
download the game I realize that's not really the legal thing you're supposed

1952
02:30:22,140 --> 02:30:25,220
to do but I just I know that's what a lot of people do and so it's kind of

1953
02:30:25,220 --> 02:30:27,860
like you're all of a sudden at this buffet and it's like oh I want to try a

1954
02:30:27,860 --> 02:30:30,060
little bit that I want a little bit that I want to try a little bit that I want

1955
02:30:30,060 --> 02:30:34,060
that that that oh my gosh I guess my eyes are bigger than my stomach you type

1956
02:30:34,060 --> 02:30:38,620
of thing so I think people just kind of get the whole like attention span you

1957
02:30:38,620 --> 02:30:43,100
know it gets harder and especially the older the game gets because when you go

1958
02:30:43,100 --> 02:30:48,460
back to an Atari 2600 game a lot of them were kind of repetitive but that's what

1959
02:30:48,540 --> 02:30:53,500
we had and that was the game and there was something about that repetition that

1960
02:30:53,500 --> 02:30:58,540
can actually be a little bit kind of Zen or you know it's kind of like when you're

1961
02:30:58,540 --> 02:31:02,660
building blocks in Minecraft that could be very a lot of repetition as well it's

1962
02:31:02,660 --> 02:31:08,420
just a different kind so going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com OMG in our

1963
02:31:08,420 --> 02:31:12,020
chat says emulators bring an embarrassment of riches it's always

1964
02:31:12,020 --> 02:31:16,700
choice anxiety for me and I never end up playing anything yeah it's kind of like

1965
02:31:16,780 --> 02:31:19,740
you start playing one thing and it's like oh I want to go hear this other thing I

1966
02:31:19,740 --> 02:31:23,740
do that on Spotify I'll start listening to one song and then suddenly that song

1967
02:31:23,740 --> 02:31:26,020
makes me think of another song that's like I never get more than halfway

1968
02:31:26,020 --> 02:31:31,980
through any song dark to see you makes a point here in our chat at live.vognetwork.com

1969
02:31:31,980 --> 02:31:36,700
saying that's also why I like the decently sized classic systems

1970
02:31:36,700 --> 02:31:41,540
Nintendo did you're not overwhelmed maybe that's why they limit it to 30 or

1971
02:31:41,540 --> 02:31:45,260
you know 24 or whatever the Super Nintendo had anyway you said there was

1972
02:31:45,260 --> 02:31:50,860
one more Jamie all right we just got another one last minute it says hey OLR

1973
02:31:50,860 --> 02:31:56,140
I just wanted to say I love you that's all hearts from Ryan oh shucks well

1974
02:31:56,140 --> 02:32:02,020
thanks I love you too hearts thank you that's great all right that was very

1975
02:32:02,020 --> 02:32:05,540
nice of you thank you well if you want to send us a little love or or you want

1976
02:32:05,540 --> 02:32:09,100

1977
02:32:09,100 --> 02:32:13,620
part I want you to send me a donut participant or you can send dar soccer a

1980
02:32:22,660 --> 02:32:27,500
Dunkin Donuts in all of Sacramento so if I could I'll drive one Krispy Kreme

1981
02:32:27,500 --> 02:32:32,900
although did you not to give them free advertising but I guess I'm gonna I think

1982
02:32:32,900 --> 02:32:37,580
it's on Tuesday Krispy Kreme is doing gingerbread glaze I really don't need to

1983
02:32:37,580 --> 02:32:42,500
eat donuts really uh-huh I don't want to regain my 25 lost pound

1984
02:32:42,500 --> 02:32:48,540
scissors very very good to you all right let's get into some more news stories

1985
02:32:48,540 --> 02:32:53,460
then we're gonna open the Skype line at orange lounge radio on Skype but first

1986
02:32:53,460 --> 02:32:57,320
Loki yeah so one of the announcements that they had during the whole Game

1987
02:32:57,320 --> 02:33:02,420
Awards was there they had a new trailer for Zelda Breath of the Wild the

1988
02:33:02,420 --> 02:33:07,180
champions ballot expansion so they showed off a little bit of you know what

1989
02:33:07,180 --> 02:33:12,900
that was with all the new you know gameplay stuff plus they even had the

1990
02:33:12,900 --> 02:33:19,060
whole new motorcycle thing that was in there the master cycle zero and then

1991
02:33:19,060 --> 02:33:24,180
they're like it's available now go download it now so you can go download

1992
02:33:24,180 --> 02:33:31,340
it now and yeah and and it's good apparently so are you not gonna talk

1993
02:33:31,340 --> 02:33:35,300
about the loot box thing I thought or did oh no we linked the long wrong thing

1994
02:33:35,300 --> 02:33:40,060
didn't we son of a bitch I'm seeing that because I was sorry Jamie talked

1995
02:33:40,060 --> 02:33:43,500
about that earlier in the show I thought that she did too you know and that bad

1996
02:33:43,500 --> 02:33:48,220
link in our show role sorry that's my bad so no no that's alright so we can

1997
02:33:48,220 --> 02:33:52,540
yeah I guess we can talk about the legislation yes I'm kind of running back

1998
02:33:52,540 --> 02:33:56,820
to you know what the whole loot box thing with Star Wars Battlefront there

1999
02:33:56,820 --> 02:34:03,860
was you know obviously Hawaii was one of the states they had some senators come

2000
02:34:03,900 --> 02:34:09,700
out talking about you know what needs to happen with that and so they're coming

2001
02:34:09,700 --> 02:34:12,300
out with like kind of what their solution would be for that so they do

2002
02:34:12,300 --> 02:34:17,980
want to fight the predatory behavior of loot boxes and so Republican or

2003
02:34:17,980 --> 02:34:24,140
representative Chris Lee he basically said that you know of course he made the

2004
02:34:24,140 --> 02:34:29,780
joke because the Star Wars that it's a trap that there's they would like we're

2005
02:34:29,780 --> 02:34:33,820
stepping up to act in Hawaii we have also been in discussion with our

2006
02:34:33,820 --> 02:34:37,180
counterparts in a number of other states who are also considering on how to

2007
02:34:37,180 --> 02:34:42,140
address this issue change is difficult at the federal level but states can and

2008
02:34:42,140 --> 02:34:46,820
are taking action so they're saying if even elected officials can't do it alone

2009
02:34:46,820 --> 02:34:51,100
they would need your support and you can compel them by you know reaching out to

2010
02:34:51,100 --> 02:34:55,500
your local representatives these kind of loot boxes and microtransactions are

2011
02:34:55,500 --> 02:34:59,620
explicitly designed to prey upon exploit human psychology the same way

2012
02:34:59,620 --> 02:35:04,580
casino games are so designed and this is especially true for young adults who

2013
02:35:04,580 --> 02:35:10,140
can't who child psychologists and other experts explain are particularly

2014
02:35:10,140 --> 02:35:14,340
vulnerable these exploitative mechanisms and deceptive business marketing

2015
02:35:14,340 --> 02:35:19,340
promoting them have no place in the games being marketed the miners and

2016
02:35:19,340 --> 02:35:24,900
perhaps no place in games at all so they would one thing that they are thinking

2017
02:35:24,900 --> 02:35:30,220
about is maybe having some sort of you know official body that basically

2018
02:35:30,220 --> 02:35:35,260
legislates this type of thing but I don't know I watched a little video the

2019
02:35:35,260 --> 02:35:39,180
guy did that he put on YouTube it was it was it it's kind of interesting too

2020
02:35:39,180 --> 02:35:42,100
because you start to realize like oh these government people are around the

2021
02:35:42,100 --> 02:35:45,240
same age I am and they probably grew up on all the same video games I did and

2022
02:35:45,240 --> 02:35:48,220
now they you know have that type of influence to be able to do the

2023
02:35:48,220 --> 02:35:53,220
legislation but I I kind of sense that maybe they're just hoping to really push

2024
02:35:53,220 --> 02:35:56,940
the game industry to really regulate itself just like it did when the ESRB

2025
02:35:56,940 --> 02:36:02,100
happen they should and honestly like if they don't it's gonna get ugly if

2026
02:36:02,100 --> 02:36:04,700
you're gonna ruin it for everybody a is gonna fuck it up for everybody if they

2027
02:36:04,700 --> 02:36:11,020
don't want to be the first time but I kind of I kind of feel like I already

2028
02:36:11,020 --> 02:36:13,860
feel like and I know not everybody's gonna believe me I already feel like

2029
02:36:13,860 --> 02:36:17,820
there's a big chunk of the gaming industry that's kind of like message

2030
02:36:17,820 --> 02:36:21,460
received you all don't like these loot boxes and I think you're starting to see

2031
02:36:21,460 --> 02:36:24,780
people already distance themselves right you know I know people have

2032
02:36:24,780 --> 02:36:28,740
already done that and in fact actually the sales of Battlefront 2 have gone

2033
02:36:28,740 --> 02:36:32,060
down quite a bit so like the sales they were saying that right now that it

2034
02:36:32,060 --> 02:36:36,100
wasn't even meeting the same numbers that the 2015 Battlefront game did and

2035
02:36:36,100 --> 02:36:39,620
they're saying I think it's only 20% of expectation that they were selling with

2036
02:36:39,620 --> 02:36:43,420
that did we not I mean I just I have throw it out there do we not just hear

2037
02:36:43,420 --> 02:36:46,540
that a couple of Ubisoft games were being delayed like by like a month and

2038
02:36:46,540 --> 02:36:51,900
these little things well is this why no I don't know if that's why I don't think

2039
02:36:51,900 --> 02:36:55,740
because I know games take a long time to develop so like of course these loot

2040
02:36:55,740 --> 02:36:59,180
boxes have already been built into games that are still scheduled to be released

2041
02:36:59,180 --> 02:37:03,780
and so forth but you have every gaming company is talking about how the

2042
02:37:03,780 --> 02:37:07,180
internet responded to Battlefront 2 right now this everybody's talking about

2043
02:37:07,180 --> 02:37:10,540
blue boxes I don't remember if that game did or not did what that's the screen

2044
02:37:10,540 --> 02:37:15,500
game I can't remember if that had did or not I don't know I would need our

2045
02:37:15,500 --> 02:37:19,820
chatters to help me out over at live dot vog network comm I don't think so I

2046
02:37:19,820 --> 02:37:26,660
don't remember but um I it's just I mean I'm not surprised that this is happening

2047
02:37:26,660 --> 02:37:31,780
because look at they've been basically kind of inching the stuff up slowly as

2048
02:37:31,780 --> 02:37:35,780
over the years you know being introduced in scene kind of like okay can we get

2049
02:37:35,780 --> 02:37:39,140
way of this can we get away with this okay we got way of that like can we get

2050
02:37:39,140 --> 02:37:45,460
away this and it just has gotten worse and worse and worse and you know some

2051
02:37:45,460 --> 02:37:50,540
people kind of can overlook it at the games really good but in this case you

2052
02:37:50,540 --> 02:37:54,420
know even with Battlefront it was just kind of okay and then it just this was

2053
02:37:54,420 --> 02:38:01,020
such an ear-fearing thing that you can't tie you can't tie your leveling system

2054
02:38:01,020 --> 02:38:05,260
to loot boxes it's just not dungeon buster and chat says AC origins they

2055
02:38:05,260 --> 02:38:08,460
really did their best to keep the helix system off to the side and make any

2056
02:38:08,460 --> 02:38:12,180
everything attainable in the game Bobby Blackwell wants to point out Ubisoft

2057
02:38:12,180 --> 02:38:15,300
said the delay is the publisher is quote investing more time in the

2058
02:38:15,340 --> 02:38:18,900
development of these games this decision is in line with our strategic vision of

2059
02:38:18,900 --> 02:38:23,140
developing even more engaging and higher quality experiences for gamers okay I'm

2060
02:38:23,140 --> 02:38:26,260
sorry that's great that that's their official line that sounds like that is

2061
02:38:26,260 --> 02:38:29,460
total PR speak and smoke and mirrors they're not gonna come out and say and

2062
02:38:29,460 --> 02:38:33,660
again to be fair it could have we had loot boxes in there and they were shitty

2063
02:38:33,660 --> 02:38:39,060
but we're just gonna and it absolutely I made that up and I theorized it and it's

2064
02:38:39,060 --> 02:38:43,460
completely possible it has nothing to fucking do with loot boxes and maybe

2065
02:38:43,500 --> 02:38:46,740
there were just some last-minute bugs that reared their ugly head that need to

2066
02:38:46,740 --> 02:38:50,540
be squashed and they don't want to say we delayed it cuz oops we had some bugs

2067
02:38:50,540 --> 02:38:53,300
they're not gonna say that so of course we're gonna get these smokes mirrors but

2068
02:38:53,300 --> 02:38:57,780
I'm just saying it is interesting that is all you know and it's I can't help

2069
02:38:57,780 --> 02:39:03,340
but think hmm I would be soft or not there's got to be a lot of developers

2070
02:39:03,340 --> 02:39:06,940
with games about to come out in 2018 that maybe had the loot box system in it

2071
02:39:06,940 --> 02:39:11,220
where they're going maybe this isn't such a good idea because fucking Star

2072
02:39:11,220 --> 02:39:16,820
Wars fucking Star Wars just got crucified over maybe I shouldn't do it

2073
02:39:16,820 --> 02:39:20,700
because I've already paid you $60 for your fucking game no and how about you

2074
02:39:20,700 --> 02:39:25,180
treat me some fucking respect your own customer because now you're like oh yeah

2075
02:39:25,180 --> 02:39:28,380
I know you pay me $60 for the game but I need more money any more money money

2076
02:39:28,380 --> 02:39:32,580
money might give you give me give me give me give me fuck you I paid for your

2077
02:39:32,580 --> 02:39:39,140
game if you can't make that game work on $60 then don't develop that game quickly

2078
02:39:39,180 --> 02:39:44,540
what do you what do you ultimately think happens with loot box issue I think that

2079
02:39:44,540 --> 02:39:48,580
they scale it back a little bit and it comes right back or you know it's

2080
02:39:48,580 --> 02:39:51,940
possible that if legislation does go in place that they just drop them all

2081
02:39:51,940 --> 02:39:54,620
together kind like they did with the online pass that was a big thing

2082
02:39:54,620 --> 02:39:58,460
everybody was doing it even then like it was like oh yeah we need to fight use

2083
02:39:58,460 --> 02:40:01,820
game sales because that's really cutting into they make fucking excuse of

2084
02:40:01,820 --> 02:40:05,900
everything oh it's piracy that's cutting our that that's why we're losing all

2085
02:40:05,900 --> 02:40:10,260
this money it's because of piracy no way no it's game sales now oh wait no

2086
02:40:10,260 --> 02:40:15,620
it's because mobile games they make fucking excuses all time and in the end

2087
02:40:15,620 --> 02:40:18,420
it's like maybe it's just because your games just not that interesting people

2088
02:40:18,420 --> 02:40:24,660
don't want to buy it maybe that could be it um but like you'll date even with

2089
02:40:24,660 --> 02:40:28,980
that other system with the online pass they kind of like have skirting up oh

2090
02:40:28,980 --> 02:40:33,100
yeah we need to pay for those online servers because they're ongoing well

2091
02:40:33,100 --> 02:40:36,620
wait a second this game is an offline game why do you need an online pass for

2092
02:40:36,620 --> 02:40:43,100
that well we want money and then it's just like people just decided they want

2093
02:40:43,100 --> 02:40:48,940
to do it anymore here here's my prediction ESRB will be cornered to put

2094
02:40:48,940 --> 02:40:52,460
loot box into the rating basically a gambling if you have loot box you're

2095
02:40:52,460 --> 02:40:56,020
gonna get a gambling warning on your game I fully under I know the ESRB has

2096
02:40:56,020 --> 02:40:59,860
come out and said before that they don't see the problem loot boxes that was then

2097
02:40:59,860 --> 02:41:03,060
this is now I think ESRB is gonna be backed into corner they're gonna have

2098
02:41:03,060 --> 02:41:07,940
to do that and I think developers will need to they're gonna have to take the

2099
02:41:07,940 --> 02:41:12,380
quote-unquote China rule and publish the just have to save it for the loop or the

2100
02:41:12,380 --> 02:41:16,740
I'm not done they're gonna have to put in the percentages of what is in the

2101
02:41:16,740 --> 02:41:20,340
loot boxes that they're gonna have to be transparent with that and games are

2102
02:41:20,340 --> 02:41:25,860
gonna go up to ten more dollars in the next two years be ready for it well

2103
02:41:25,860 --> 02:41:30,060
here's the thing with the games going up ten dollars you know what fuck them they

2104
02:41:30,060 --> 02:41:34,780
already charged that kind of mine no I'm sorry and that's fine you are free

2105
02:41:34,780 --> 02:41:38,500
to choose what you want to buy what you buy and I'm gonna tell you gay when the

2106
02:41:38,500 --> 02:41:42,820
loot boxes go games gonna go up ten dollars two years and you know it's

2107
02:41:42,820 --> 02:41:48,620
gonna happen there's a 44 K is why and here's no and here's that's stupid too

2108
02:41:48,620 --> 02:41:52,120
but I just tell you here's what's gonna happen in those the loot boxes will

2109
02:41:52,120 --> 02:41:55,060
still be in there they'll raise them ten dollars and that shit will still be in

2110
02:41:55,060 --> 02:41:59,020
there because they want all of the money you give them some of the money and they

2111
02:41:59,020 --> 02:42:02,140
want all of the money that's what's gonna happen it's not because they need

2112
02:42:02,140 --> 02:42:06,800
the money they even said to their investors that pulling back the loot

2113
02:42:06,800 --> 02:42:12,540
boxes in Star Wars Battlefront was not gonna affect them monetarily all right

2114
02:42:12,540 --> 02:42:17,500
we'll see what happens moving on here's something a little more closer to home

2115
02:42:17,500 --> 02:42:20,460
which I think is interesting a little bit of Sacramento in the news actually

2116
02:42:20,460 --> 02:42:25,540
and this has to do with the Sacramento Kings they're a basketball team now they

2117
02:42:25,540 --> 02:42:28,100
don't usually make the playoffs you might not have heard of them before we

2118
02:42:28,140 --> 02:42:31,460
have a basketball it's in the NBA a little team called the Sacramento Kings

2119
02:42:31,460 --> 02:42:35,700
here in Sacramento and you may not know that they built a new arena a couple it

2120
02:42:35,700 --> 02:42:39,460
was very controversial here in the area but and I wasn't the biggest fan of it

2121
02:42:39,460 --> 02:42:45,860
either but I must admit it has really kind of pushed downtown to overall

2122
02:42:45,860 --> 02:42:48,900
transform you know there's a lot of new stuff that's down there and like things

2123
02:42:48,900 --> 02:42:53,060
to do down in the downtown area so we have this new you know arena that's

2124
02:42:53,060 --> 02:42:56,180
there well the reason why I bring all that up is because it was just announced

2125
02:42:56,180 --> 02:43:01,140
this week the Sacramento Kings put a new eSports training facility within that

2126
02:43:01,140 --> 02:43:05,100
arena which called the golden one Center gold ones Bank around here so they they

2127
02:43:05,100 --> 02:43:09,500
actually they have opened up an eSports training facility so they're calling it

2128
02:43:09,500 --> 02:43:13,580
a venue within a venue where there's a training facility broadcast center and

2129
02:43:13,580 --> 02:43:17,820
gamer lounge in that same area where the Kings basically do their games the

2130
02:43:17,820 --> 02:43:22,140
eSports venue will have fast connections lag free gaming theater style seating

2131
02:43:22,140 --> 02:43:25,940
for tournaments and events professional gamers that end up on the Kings eSports

2132
02:43:25,940 --> 02:43:30,540
team will be able to access the same stuff that NBA athletes get like the

2133
02:43:30,540 --> 02:43:36,780
food program and the oxygen bar that you know NBA players have access to the

2134
02:43:36,780 --> 02:43:41,580
eSports studios got 4k cameras green screens the whole thing is on the 4k

2135
02:43:41,580 --> 02:43:46,500
ultra HD broadcast center so that studio will end up being a massive backstage

2136
02:43:46,500 --> 02:43:51,900
area for musical acts as well with a ton of video games to play and a DJ rig for

2137
02:43:51,900 --> 02:43:55,020
musicians to mess around with so that's kind of interesting that they're

2138
02:43:55,020 --> 02:43:58,140
multitasking for when the bands come to town they could just play all the

2139
02:43:58,140 --> 02:44:02,500
fucking video games in the training center which I think is interesting so

2140
02:44:02,500 --> 02:44:05,140
that's kind of neat that that's happening in our backyard we'll just

2141
02:44:05,140 --> 02:44:09,180
we'll be sitting right here waiting for our invite to tour the facility as you

2142
02:44:09,180 --> 02:44:12,740
know we'll just we'll just be right over here guys hello well right you know when

2143
02:44:12,740 --> 02:44:19,420
when we were doing our stuff for work when I had to do the eSports thing that

2144
02:44:19,420 --> 02:44:24,500
we talked to the guys that were you know ahead of the marina there and yeah

2145
02:44:24,500 --> 02:44:28,140
eSports was a big consideration when they were designing the arena so mm-hmm

2146
02:44:28,140 --> 02:44:31,460
not surprised yeah no I think they even said that this was one of the things that

2147
02:44:31,460 --> 02:44:39,340
was coming was the whole 2k NBA thing mm-hmm we'll see all right moving on

2148
02:44:39,340 --> 02:44:46,620
dark Sakura well there's another game in the five nights at Freddy's franchise

2149
02:44:46,620 --> 02:44:53,580
and it's cute you design pizzas feed kids and get higher scores and it's

2150
02:44:53,580 --> 02:44:59,860
called Freddy fast pizza simulator shush you're ruining my spoilers but

2151
02:44:59,860 --> 02:45:06,940
that's not all it is some kind of spoilery quotes from people this game is

2152
02:45:06,940 --> 02:45:11,180
not what it claims to be do not be tricked by the screenshots and trailer

2153
02:45:11,180 --> 02:45:18,340
what just happened all you can do is play pizza simulator for free on steam

2154
02:45:18,340 --> 02:45:25,180
that's all you'll know and then tell us I'm glad it's free that's great

2155
02:45:25,180 --> 02:45:30,780
especially after the whole debacle with the RPG game this pizza has incomplete

2156
02:45:30,780 --> 02:45:35,780
choices for toppings because pineapple is not available it's not topping well

2157
02:45:35,780 --> 02:45:39,380
no wonder they were your whore mouth no wonder they want to murder everybody

2158
02:45:39,380 --> 02:45:45,460
there that's the wrong answer bitches I also have one other very quick piece of

2159
02:45:45,460 --> 02:45:50,020
news okay on the animal Animal Crossing pocket

2160
02:45:50,020 --> 02:45:54,620

2161
02:45:54,620 --> 02:45:58,660
announcement this is in an upcoming update a guarding and clothing crafting

02:46:08,140 --> 02:46:14,260
you get you get Rover and you can grow flowers and make your clothes will they

2165
02:46:14,260 --> 02:46:18,260
make more prison outfits for those that wish to build a camp where they imprison

2166
02:46:18,260 --> 02:46:21,460
the animals oh I watched some of that it was funny as shit that's pretty good

2167
02:46:21,460 --> 02:46:27,940
kind of creepy though I'll just lock Ed in there welcome to dark soccer's camp

2168
02:46:27,940 --> 02:46:33,300
it's called glue factory all right moving on a couple more stories for you

2169
02:46:33,300 --> 02:46:37,980
guys that we're gonna get to Skype Loki so a new world record has been set for

2170
02:46:37,980 --> 02:46:42,520
Minecraft that's right speedrunning Minecraft just got faster because of a

2171
02:46:42,520 --> 02:46:48,160
new exploit where placing an end crystal right as you get to the end

2172
02:46:48,160 --> 02:46:53,160
allows you to actually skip the whole boss fight with the ender dragon and so

2173
02:46:53,160 --> 02:46:59,320
because of that now that the new record is actually a little bit faster so

2174
02:46:59,320 --> 02:47:05,760
record originally was four minutes seven seconds or and now the new run actually

2175
02:47:05,760 --> 02:47:13,560
stands at three minutes 20 seconds so not bad I'm sorry that was the previous

2176
02:47:13,560 --> 02:47:16,360
we're gonna yeah that's right that's gonna say I saw this a lot faster so

2177
02:47:16,360 --> 02:47:22,560
they did it in what was the time on this oh man I watched this earlier today I

2178
02:47:22,560 --> 02:47:28,360
think it was like a minute 40 or something this is pretty quick but see

2179
02:47:28,360 --> 02:47:34,240
they do it with like a set seed mm-hmm so let's see oh to cut it yeah make

2180
02:47:34,640 --> 02:47:40,320
standard I'm in at 35 is what it was SSG 100 Matt wants to know if Minecraft is

2181
02:47:40,320 --> 02:47:44,200
an AGD queue this year no but maybe this is something they could submit for a

2182
02:47:44,200 --> 02:47:51,160
future it would be really short it would be really short and SD owner Matt says I

2183
02:47:51,160 --> 02:47:54,300
just checked and nope yeah I figured that was the case they've had it in the

2184
02:47:54,300 --> 02:47:58,920
past and I watched it and I was bored because it's just I thought you know

2185
02:47:58,920 --> 02:48:02,920
when I thought it was like oh they're just gonna pick a random seed and go at

2186
02:48:02,960 --> 02:48:07,120
it and yeah quickly they can do it but it was like oh we have a set seed and I

2187
02:48:07,120 --> 02:48:10,840
just have to dig straight down to get to where I need to get and that I'm done

2188
02:48:10,840 --> 02:48:15,240
that's that's like hacking the game it's like yeah which to be fair is kind of

2189
02:48:15,240 --> 02:48:18,480
how they speed run some of this right here this is a tool assisted speed run

2190
02:48:18,480 --> 02:48:26,080
too so assisted I don't know all right well by the way we're gonna open up the

2191
02:48:26,080 --> 02:48:29,560
skype line it's available right now orange lounge radio all one word it's

2192
02:48:29,840 --> 02:48:33,820

2193
02:48:33,820 --> 02:48:38,080
do with I don't know if you know the name Manami Matsumae you guys know

2194
02:48:38,080 --> 02:48:43,180
Manami Matsumae Matsumae Matsumae did I pronounce that wrong Matsumae yeah why

2195
02:48:43,180 --> 02:48:47,960
my Japanese is terrible but anyway she is the composer of the original Megaman

2196
02:48:47,960 --> 02:48:51,720
game and then I think she came back and she did some of this I think she did one

2197
02:48:51,720 --> 02:48:55,320
or two of the Shovel Knight tracks when I was taken she may have done mighty

2198
02:48:55,320 --> 02:48:59,400
number nine I can't remember if that she was part of the Kickstarter stretch

2199
02:48:59,400 --> 02:49:05,560
for that but anyway she is going to be releasing a solo album so brave wave

2200
02:49:05,560 --> 02:49:09,540
productions is who she's working with for that and the album is called three

2201
02:49:09,540 --> 02:49:14,560
movements and it's more than just chiptune and stuff trance will be

2202
02:49:14,560 --> 02:49:18,960

02:49:57,720 --> 02:50:04,480
weekend yes I was tell us about it how was did you did you go to the the little

2212
02:50:04,480 --> 02:50:08,840
Friday like kickback let's you know smoke weed and talk about PlayStation

2213
02:50:08,840 --> 02:50:12,440
event that they had on Friday or was no I didn't have them going I'm kind of

2214
02:50:12,440 --> 02:50:17,720
glad I didn't I don't blame you necessarily all right well how was the

2215
02:50:17,720 --> 02:50:24,440
show itself tell us a little bit about you know the the show itself sure well I

2216
02:50:24,480 --> 02:50:31,480
went actually last year too and I think this year's was better it's mostly

2217
02:50:31,480 --> 02:50:36,440
really it's really focused on indie games so they have you know who is

2218
02:50:36,440 --> 02:50:40,560
spread all over the place various games all types of genres you know they have

2219
02:50:40,560 --> 02:50:46,240
their Sony section but really it's total it's like probably 70 80 percent indie

2220
02:50:46,240 --> 02:50:51,040
or small games that are there really that's great yeah that's pretty cool

2221
02:50:51,040 --> 02:50:54,680
that's interesting that you say it's better than last year because most

2222
02:50:54,680 --> 02:50:58,560
people are probably looking at it going but the keynote was better last year so

2223
02:50:58,560 --> 02:51:06,240
what about it for you was better I just think they had a better setup like two

2224
02:51:06,240 --> 02:51:13,560
years ago or less whatever it was I went they their setup was really small sort

2225
02:51:13,560 --> 02:51:20,600
of like gamer X is Paul in the early years oh wow that you know even though

2226
02:51:20,600 --> 02:51:24,120
was in the same convention center the Anaheim Convention Center it was really

2227
02:51:24,120 --> 02:51:30,080
small and crowded so you you had a hard time getting around I think they planned

2228
02:51:30,080 --> 02:51:36,160
it out better the floor space there's more room between the rows really and I

2229
02:51:36,160 --> 02:51:43,400
think the game quality probably similar I just think they also brought a bunch

2230
02:51:43,400 --> 02:51:51,040
of stuff from e3 like not games they brought like the setup so they had like

2231
02:51:51,040 --> 02:51:56,440
Sega at e3 had like this sort of Tokyo hallway thing I don't know how to

2232
02:51:56,440 --> 02:52:02,720
explain it but they brought all the big stuff there to psx as well you know what

2233
02:52:02,720 --> 02:52:06,920
they didn't bring those fantasy star online too and I'm still salty about it

2234
02:52:06,920 --> 02:52:16,440
so just saying oh I wish we all wish but so it was more glitzy too I guess you

2235
02:52:16,440 --> 02:52:20,720
could say okay no that's good that's good you want to make when people are at

2236
02:52:20,720 --> 02:52:23,900
this Expo you want to make it feel luxurious because they spent a lot of

2237
02:52:23,900 --> 02:52:27,880
money to go I'm sure in PSX one of those cons like I keep meaning to go every

2238
02:52:27,880 --> 02:52:30,800
year but it's just this time of year is not always the best I but one of these

2239
02:52:30,800 --> 02:52:34,040
news dammit I'm gonna get there but let me ask this because you mentioned it was

2240
02:52:34,040 --> 02:52:39,360
so much indie game what's a game that caught your eye that you don't think

2241
02:52:39,360 --> 02:52:45,080
enough people are talking about that maybe they should be well my favorite

2242
02:52:45,080 --> 02:52:51,960
game that's coming up from the indie scene and it was sort of it's been

2243
02:52:51,960 --> 02:52:55,600
shown a little bit of other at other conventions maybe even packs but for me

2244
02:52:55,600 --> 02:53:00,640
it's donut County donut County yeah I think they showed a trailer for that

2245
02:53:00,640 --> 02:53:09,600
sometime recently but it's basically sort of like a katamari game except you

2246
02:53:09,600 --> 02:53:14,520
are a hole in the ground a small hole in the ground and it's sort of like you you

2247
02:53:14,520 --> 02:53:18,680
need to have objects fall into it and the more objects that fall in the larger

2248
02:53:18,680 --> 02:53:23,680
the hole becomes and then you can grab bigger things like houses and stuff like

2249
02:53:23,680 --> 02:53:27,800
that okay that sounds like more like that's weird they call it donut cuz I

2250
02:53:27,800 --> 02:53:37,720
think like black hole or something is what that sounds like yeah Florida don't

2251
02:53:37,720 --> 02:53:44,880
fall through the floor it uh okay it's really cute the art style you know

2252
02:53:44,880 --> 02:53:50,040
that's it's like a world of animals it's I think that's really good-looking game

2253
02:53:50,040 --> 02:53:54,360
and you can swallow them whole these cute animals and then they're like they

2254
02:53:54,360 --> 02:53:58,160
live underground from then on oh okay so it's a little happy ending that's

2255
02:53:58,160 --> 02:54:03,800
cute it reminds me of Animaniacs does it remember when they go down the hole

2256
02:54:03,800 --> 02:54:12,160
what's that tiny toons or was that animated that was tiny that was tiny

2257
02:54:12,160 --> 02:54:23,960
tunes cuz it was baby plucky elevator go down the whole okay so we just you know

2258
02:54:23,960 --> 02:54:27,120
took this game you're really excited about yeah it's 90s animation awesome

2259
02:54:27,120 --> 02:54:31,960
all right well MXC thank you for letting us know about your trip to a PSX I'm

2261
02:54:36,080 --> 02:54:41,160
wasn't even planning to go this year but my plan sort of got dashed because of

2262
02:54:41,160 --> 02:54:47,520
all the fires so right so I just say well I'll just go to PSX all right well

2263

2267
02:55:03,440 --> 02:55:06,600
open for just a little bit and then we'll probably move to wrap up here

2268
02:55:06,600 --> 02:55:10,680
before too long because it is already after nine o'clock here on the West

2269
02:55:10,680 --> 02:55:13,680
Coast which means midnight for you East coasters but we do have another call

2270
02:55:13,680 --> 02:55:16,880
coming in speaking of East coasters hi you're on orange lounge radio who's this

2271
02:55:16,880 --> 02:55:21,480
hey what's going on everybody it's Ron hey Ron mutts past your bedtime what's

2272
02:55:21,480 --> 02:55:27,280
up my friend what is this bedtime that you speak that's right it doesn't exist

2273
02:55:27,280 --> 02:55:32,840
anymore once you get to a certain point what's on your mind I'm on a system of

2274
02:55:32,840 --> 02:55:36,720
five hours of sleep that's all I need five hours of sleep and endless supply

2275
02:55:36,720 --> 02:55:43,040
of coffee at work I'm good I had to cut back on coffee because my heartbeat was

2276
02:55:43,040 --> 02:55:48,760
getting funky and so my doctor was like how much coffee do you drink and I told

2277
02:55:48,760 --> 02:55:54,280
her and she said maybe you want to stop drinking coffee no I was like okay sorry

2278
02:55:54,280 --> 02:55:59,960
let's hear that let's not talk crazy because that's not gonna happen I

2279
02:55:59,960 --> 02:56:03,840
actually laughed at her I said that's not gonna happen so she said let's try

2280
02:56:03,840 --> 02:56:09,240
cutting back on coffee okay that's that's more reasonable and as he did

2281
02:56:09,240 --> 02:56:14,280
fix it Mike problems on the way yeah yeah that works but um I wanted to

2282
02:56:14,280 --> 02:56:21,480
mention the main reason why I stopped playing Candy Crush is that I even with

2283
02:56:21,480 --> 02:56:26,560
the even with cheating the damn game I couldn't pass half the frickin levels I

2284
02:56:26,560 --> 02:56:30,160
was like nope done I can't do this anymore

2285
02:56:30,160 --> 02:56:36,720
how do you cheat Candy Crush all right a few years ago there was an add-on app if

2286
02:56:37,080 --> 02:56:43,200
your if your device was rooted it would edit your save game we could have an

2287
02:56:43,200 --> 02:56:48,200
unlimited amount of lives and power-ups and bonuses and I will go into the level

2288
02:56:48,200 --> 02:56:57,640
maxing out when I sat there at level 412 going through these power-ups and not

2289
02:56:57,640 --> 02:57:02,760
passing the stage I said you know what I believe I am done I'm going to find some

2290
02:57:02,760 --> 02:57:08,240
other games to play to kill time and then friends started telling about soda

2291
02:57:08,240 --> 02:57:15,880
saga about 15 levels in I said nope this ain't happening no I'm not getting caught

2292
02:57:15,880 --> 02:57:20,280
up in this again nope nope not gonna happen no I fell for this once I'm not

2293
02:57:20,280 --> 02:57:28,240
doing it again exactly God I wish that worked on me on me and MMOs but it's

2294
02:57:28,240 --> 02:57:34,600
just not going to everyone has their vice I guess what you've robbed MMOs is

2295
02:57:34,600 --> 02:57:39,520
your vice it is it's just always gonna be that so so there's like a little

2296
02:57:39,520 --> 02:57:45,480
syringe next to your bed that says ff14 on one one says wow you know you just

2297
02:57:45,480 --> 02:57:49,320
pick one that you want to tap the vein for that day then you have to get the

2298
02:57:49,320 --> 02:57:53,880
random shit like you got a bug up your ass to play the Old Republic today try

2299
02:57:53,880 --> 02:57:57,720
that so or elder screw well you met somebody who plays Elder Scrolls online

2300
02:57:57,760 --> 02:58:04,400
so you thought maybe this will be a good idea to play so yeah all right speaking

2301
02:58:04,400 --> 02:58:07,080
of old school I'm gonna say this one where they want to get out of here I

2302
02:58:07,080 --> 02:58:14,400
think right Enix may just be giving us rad racer 3 ooh why is that I was

2303
02:58:14,400 --> 02:58:19,640
playing around on the Google Play Store one day just exploring so I came across

2304
02:58:19,640 --> 02:58:25,960
a game title of a classic NES game that square put out that I would use to sit

2305
02:58:25,960 --> 02:58:29,560
there as a kid play the ever-loving daylights out of that's on the Play

2306
02:58:29,560 --> 02:58:37,160
Store do you remember a game called Kings night I do remember the name but

2307
02:58:37,160 --> 02:58:40,680
I'm having trouble remembering the gameplay in my head but of course now

2308
02:58:40,680 --> 02:58:45,000
I'm going to this good old-fashioned Google and looking it up it was like it

2309
02:58:45,000 --> 02:58:49,920
it's like a top-down shooter but not a shooter it was a top-down and you

2310
02:58:49,920 --> 02:58:52,800
controlled the character you're just throwing weapons and stuff like that

2311
02:58:53,000 --> 02:58:57,320
they're trying to save the princess he choose from four different characters

2312
02:58:57,320 --> 02:59:02,680
yeah yep I do remember this now yeah yeah they totally overhauled it and put

2313
02:59:02,680 --> 02:59:10,000
it out for mobile devices that's pretty rad and I have found myself there in the

2314
02:59:10,000 --> 02:59:14,940
company bathroom dark to see in chat says I heard about the sequel to that I

2315
02:59:14,940 --> 02:59:18,320
think it was a tie-in for Final Fantasy 15 it'll be an interesting way to

2316
02:59:18,400 --> 02:59:23,400
leverage an old product oh good lord that's Kings night by the way is the

2317
02:59:23,400 --> 02:59:28,640
name of that yeah so I'm like well this is good I wonder what the odds of them

2318
02:59:28,640 --> 02:59:33,280
bringing us rad racer I'm just saying hell we got puzzle fighter what more can

2319
02:59:33,280 --> 02:59:39,080

2320
02:59:39,080 --> 02:59:43,920
minute because it's kind of crap no well we can but let me tell you me my sister

2321
02:59:44,120 --> 02:59:49,320

2351
03:01:58,640 --> 03:02:02,760

2352
03:02:02,760 --> 03:02:09,520
say that while I'm in the middle of typing sorry words that's it it's very

2353
03:02:09,520 --> 03:02:15,200
very deep very complex final thought Loki your final thought tonight my final

2354
03:02:15,200 --> 03:02:21,240
thought is aside from ready player one watching that trailer this weekend what

2355
03:02:21,240 --> 03:02:26,040
the fuck is up with the eyes and battle angel Alita I mean seriously did they

2356
03:02:26,040 --> 03:02:31,320
think putting anime eyes on a person was a good idea actually that wasn't a
