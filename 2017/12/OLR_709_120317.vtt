This week Milwaukee no longer requires augmented reality game companies to obtain a physical permit for a virtual location. So go enjoy the outdoors if it's reasonable. That's just one piece of closure in tonight's gaming news. Stay tuned for the rest of the week's headlines starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:31.000 --> 00:54.000
Hello my friends and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight on December the 3rd of 2017 with episode number 709 of our show. We're here over the next few hours to talk about video games. Myself, Rob Roberts, you might know me on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E. And over there, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Hi.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
Hi, how are you?

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Spiteful.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
Spiteful?

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Yeah.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Good to hear about that.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
What's new?

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Somebody made the mistake of pissing you off.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Yeah, someone I'm related to, so I got dirt.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
Those are usually the ones to piss us off first, just saying.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Oh, I got dirt.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
I know, I know. We'll get into that later.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
Yeah.

01:12.000 --> 01:24.000
So I have to mention here on OLR, I know I briefly mentioned it on Bobby's show because we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, right after our pal Bobby Blackwolf and his program.

01:25.000 --> 01:37.000
And we were talking about on the call, because he's good to donate 5, 10 minutes of his show every week to us when he calls us to do this little, what did we call it way back in the beginning, the Stuart Colbert thing, the throw, the toss.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
The handoff?

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
Yeah, the handoff, I guess.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
It's the handjob.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
Now, Bobby, show us a family show.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
But we're not.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
It's handwork.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
All right, anyway.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
His is the happy ending.

01:48.000 --> 01:53.000
And we were talking about your hoodie that you have that is it's Cassandra from Dragon Age?

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
Yeah, it's the Cassandra armor hoodie.

01:56.000 --> 02:01.000
So it's got like leatherette-ish shoulder pads and gauntlets and the big Inquisition symbol.

02:01.000 --> 02:07.000
And I like it because I'm wearing leggings today because I didn't give a fuck and it covers my ass.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
So she literally paid for cosmetics.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Hi, Tech Master Loki, how are you?

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
I'm fine.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Good.

02:14.000 --> 02:19.000
No, but I mean, this thing looks like full cosplay garb when she's wearing it around the house.

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
And I'm like, when she has to go grocery shopping at seven and then defend the realm at eight.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
Yeah, I'll find a link to it on the BioWare store and link it in the chat.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
OK, there you go.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
Yeah, but it also, though, is really freaking comfortable.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
That's the fun thing about it.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
And I'll go ahead and throw this out there.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
I've lost twenty five pounds in the last two months.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Congrats.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Thank you.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
It's really comfortable now.

02:42.000 --> 02:47.000
It's so soft on the inside and it's just it's like wearing a blanket.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
So almost like wearing my kigurumi.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
But my kigurumi is way comfier.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
So it's a Snuggie.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
It's not it's not tight.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
That's it's different when it actually fits and isn't a little too small.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
I should mention we do tape live on Sunday nights.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
I mentioned that part the six o'clock Eastern at voice network.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
But I don't believe I mentioned our chat room.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
If you are listening live, you can join our chat room over at live dot vog network dot com.

03:11.000 --> 03:16.000
Where Dark Tetsuya says that segment is called the toss over what we're trying to think of there.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
Yeah, but toss is offensive in Europe.

03:18.000 --> 03:23.000
Vid Power says, I heard Cassandra and Armor and I immediately thought of Soul Calibur.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
Well, that's it's not a bad thing you're doing.

03:26.000 --> 03:32.000
You know, there's just there's many characters named Cassandra who are great and amazing.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
So there you go.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
High tech master Loki.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
I know we said hi to you a minute ago, but your official introduction.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
How are you doing this week?

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
I'm doing OK.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
Yeah. What's new in your world?

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
Nothing.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
No Lego projects.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
No, nothing.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
No, not really.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
I mean, nothing I can discuss.

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
No, I really am doing like Christmas shopping.

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
So it got some of that out of the way.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
Since you are a Lego guy, let me ask you about this,

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
because I don't remember if it came up on last week's show,

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
but I know it was all over Twitter either last week or this past week.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
Is that apparently the Tron.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
Yes, that was me that posted that.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
Yes. So Tron.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Yeah, you posted that.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
So yes, we got the approval pass the review process.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
Yes, the Lego.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
So Lego does this contest like all year round.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
Yeah, it's all the time.

04:19.000 --> 04:24.000
So it's basically this page called Lego ideas so you can submit your own designs for things.

04:25.000 --> 04:33.000
And if they get 10,000 votes, then it goes to a committee that they basically decide whether they want to make it into a set or not.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
And I've seen the one for RuPaul's Drag Race, and I don't understand why it doesn't have 10,000 votes.

04:37.000 --> 04:42.000
A lot of them. Well, yeah, some of those like it's kind of weird why they don't have 10,000 votes.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
And they do give you more time as you get more votes.

04:45.000 --> 04:51.000
And a lot of the things that they don't seem to get votes for or don't approve are stuff that they have to license.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Right.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
Because there's a lot of like license stuff that people want to pass through there.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
But this winter.

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
But the Tron light cycle, yes, did make the cut.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
So apparently it is going to be coming out at some point.

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
Now, the one that they showed online is the one that, you know, the person designed.

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
So Lego actually goes and then does the design for it based off of what they did.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
But it's really cool those sets.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
I've got one.

05:13.000 --> 05:21.000
It's the old fishing store is one that came out not too long ago in September.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
And that was a pretty nice set.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
And they've got it's kind of cool inside those Lego idea sets.

05:26.000 --> 05:32.000
They have like kind of a brief like bio of the person that designed it and kind of showing like his prototype and stuff.

05:32.000 --> 05:39.000
And like talking about the Lego designer and what how they adapted the design to make it like Lego stuff.

05:39.000 --> 05:44.000
Well, I'm glad something is kind of keeping Tron going when I get worried that Disney's forgetting about it.

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
Although, to be fair, the theme parks, you know, we know the Tron thing is going to happen in Florida.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
So Tron is is not forgotten.

05:51.000 --> 05:56.000
And of course, if you like video games and you like Disney stuff like Tron is.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
I mean, you've got Kingdom Hearts and you've got Tron.

05:59.000 --> 06:04.000
And I think, you know, people of a certain generation kind of really fondly remember Tron.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
At least I know I do.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
Nothing against Kingdom Hearts.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
But seriously, explain the plot of Kingdom Hearts to me.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
Go.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
I haven't played enough.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
It's only a three hour podcast.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
You don't have enough time to explain the plot of Kingdom Hearts.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
Disney and Capcom fucking have an ugly baby.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Not Capcom Square.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
Yes.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
Well, you know why you said Capcom?

06:21.000 --> 06:25.000
Because the old NES games were all the Capcom stuff like an Oscar paid.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
And of course, DuckTales.

06:26.000 --> 06:32.000
You know, Disney and Squeenix fucking have an ugly baby with bad fashion choices.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
Yes.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
They have like other weird sets that have become like Lego ideas.

06:36.000 --> 06:41.000
So it's like you may remember they have the Big Bang Theory set.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
Burn it.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
Yeah, that's terrible.

06:43.000 --> 06:52.000
The one that they have coming or that it's proposed they're going to be considering it, I should say, is the set for Gilmore Girls.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
That's funny.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
I know people that are really into that show.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
They're like that.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
Oh, oh, has anyone submitted a set for The Good Place?

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
Not yet.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
My favorite sitcom as of late.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
No, not yet.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
I talked about that.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
I mean, I think I've given that show free publicity like every week.

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
I actually got that message on Facebook a couple of weeks ago from from my buddy Brad

07:14.000 --> 07:19.000
from Pod Culture on the network who said you talk about it so much on OLR.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
I finally watched it.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
I watched all of season one.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
It was pretty funny.

07:23.000 --> 07:28.000
Yeah, I mean, I probably am a few episodes behind, but yeah, I did.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
I did actually.

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
I've been watching all of it and it's fantastic.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
Yeah, I watched it.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
You know what I watch?

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
What?

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
I watch the Discovery Channel.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
Actually, sometimes the History Channel.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
Yeah, Batman Ninja, because that trailer came out this week.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
That looks awesome.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
It's a real thing.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
He's not really look.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
He doesn't look like a ninja.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
He looks like samurai.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
Yeah, but who cares?

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
Dear white people.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
I don't care what they call it.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
It looks awesome.

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
Dear white people, don't make it look Japanese and call it ninja.

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
Like a feudal Japan Batman versus a joker.

08:07.000 --> 08:13.000
It would be more accurate to me to make him like Batman the Ronin.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
That would be pretty badass.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
All right, let's get into video games.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
Believe it or not, it's a video game show.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
We're going to run a little bit of a shorter show tonight.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
So here's the deal.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
I was gone all weekend.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
Jamie has an appointment in the morning, so we can't go too late into the night.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
So we're going to do a little bit of a shorter show.

08:28.000 --> 08:32.000
And because I just got home from my trip about an hour and a half ago,

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
we don't have a script tonight.

08:34.000 --> 08:38.000
The show's not scripted, but we have what we call a show roll with the itemized stories.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
I got to totally derail the show again.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
What a shock.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
Just briefly, we totally need to have a Good Place episode

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
where we just censor ourselves exactly like the agent on the show,

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
because that would be hilarious.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
Maybe April Fools, we could do that.

08:51.000 --> 08:56.000
Because I'm always shocked that we actually have a wiki.

08:56.000 --> 09:01.000
On the wiki, it's like orangeloungeradio.wiki.com.

09:01.000 --> 09:05.000
And I don't think I've ever edited an article on there, maybe once.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
So I'm really impressed by like...

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
I edited my own article.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
Did you really?

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
Yeah, because people got some of the shit wrong.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
That's right.

09:12.000 --> 09:17.000
But I think most of it has been powered by listeners of the show, which I think is amazing.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
But where was I going with this?

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
Oh, yes.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
So one of the jokes, you can read about this on the wiki,

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
because this joke kind of expired several hundred episodes ago.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
But we kept talking about how we were going to do a fuck show.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
And I don't remember where this came from.

09:26.000 --> 09:30.000
I don't know if it was because we were talking about how movies, like Pulp Fiction,

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
say the word fuck like 260 times.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
I think it came from a joke like, oh, we could outdo that.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
Because House of the Dead was one of the House of the Dead games.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
That's it.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
Like one of the movies that Uwe Boll did was trying to say...

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
No, it wasn't even Uwe Boll.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
It was House of the Dead Overkill.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
It was a game that came out.

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
And they were like, oh, yeah, we inserted the word fuck so many times into that.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
It has a record number of fucks in there.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
And I'm like, we could beat that.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
Yeah, so we did.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
But we finally delivered on that episode.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
I don't remember the number.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
It wasn't as funny as we had thought.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
No, some of those things were like...

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
Then when the show happened, I think halfway through, we were like,

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
okay, we thought it would be a lot funnier, and it really wasn't.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
No, it was on paper it was funny.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
But a Good Place episode.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
A Good Place episode would be funny.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
That would be funny.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
So there you go.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
All right, anyway.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
So back to games, Loki.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Sorry.

10:25.000 --> 10:31.000
So anyway, I was out of town this weekend playing Ingress, which is a cell phone game.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
I play it a lot.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
I don't always talk about it here on the show because it's kind of like one of those things

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
that kind of comes and goes in waves, right?

10:37.000 --> 10:41.000
So Ingress, if you don't know the game, it's by the people who did Pokemon Go,

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
but it's the game that they did before Pokemon Go.

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
So all your PokeStops and your gyms and stuff come from this game, Ingress.

10:47.000 --> 10:52.000
Ingress has a small but very rabid following here in the US.

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
It's very big in Japan, which is I think part of the reason why Pokemon Go,

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
how Nintendo kind of got connected with them.

10:58.000 --> 11:02.000
I think we know that story that the Pokemon company guy actually was playing Ingress,

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
and that whole thing happened.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
And it's big around the world.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
A lot of people are out there playing it on their cell phones

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
because it kind of gets them out and they're moving.

11:10.000 --> 11:17.000
So anyway, every few months, like once a quarter or so in various cities around the world,

11:17.000 --> 11:23.000
they will do these big live battles where special events happen in big cities,

11:23.000 --> 11:27.000
and it's kind of a chance to get together with hundreds of other people who play the game

11:27.000 --> 11:31.000
and basically play a different version of the game for four hours on a Saturday.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
That's my nutshell description of what happened on Saturday

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
because San Francisco was one of the cities picked,

11:35.000 --> 11:39.000
which is only about a two-hour drive from OLR headquarters here in Sacramento.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
So we were able to drive over and play the game there.

11:42.000 --> 11:49.000
So I bring that all up because it kind of leads to a lot of AR news that's going on.

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
So we've got hundreds of people swarming downtown San Francisco playing this game,

11:53.000 --> 11:59.000
and I think what they do, I think Niantic's really good about contacting the tourism industry in these cities

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
and kind of letting them know what's happening so that way the city's kind of prepared for it,

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
although I don't, you know, in these events I've been,

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
this is only my third live event that I've attended in person.

12:07.000 --> 12:12.000
I did one in Tucson last year, and I did one in Chicago.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
And I don't remember, and then this one is San Francisco,

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
and I don't remember any of them being particularly like,

12:16.000 --> 12:20.000
oh, the city did anything special type of thing, but it's just, I guess, like a heads up or whatever.

12:20.000 --> 12:25.000
So anyway, I want to kick off tonight's show because not only did I have that AR thing going on,

12:25.000 --> 12:30.000
which is why I'm very tired today, but we had some big news going on in AR gaming

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
that kind of changes essentially the future of AR gaming, right, Dark Sakura?

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
Yeah, but I need to, I do need to make a quick disclaimer.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
Okay.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
I do know that the Kill la Kill guy is behind the Ninja Batman.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
I was quoting something from Facebook.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
Oh, oh, is this something in chat? Somebody correct me?

12:45.000 --> 12:52.000
Yeah, I was like, I know I am quoting something that someone said on Facebook because it was funny.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
Was it though? Was it?

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
Whatever.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
All right, moving on.

12:56.000 --> 13:01.000
Yeah, and I didn't get to go because I was sick to the AR thing.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
Sorry to hear it.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Yeah, it is what it is.

13:04.000 --> 13:15.000
So, um, but man, why, why can't we have nice things in, um, you know, for Pokemon Go?

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
It's because people decide to be shit.

13:17.000 --> 13:24.000
Um, in Milwaukee County, there was a lawsuit that went against Niantic

13:24.000 --> 13:29.000
because the players went and trashed a big park, Lake Park.

13:29.000 --> 13:35.000
And so, uh, the county got Niantic to remove the PokeStops and that should have set it down,

13:35.000 --> 13:42.000
but then they passed an ordinance that said that, um, that companies that want to do, uh,

13:42.000 --> 13:49.000
augmented reality in these places have to have a permit with like some kind of insurance.

13:49.000 --> 13:53.000
It's sorry, a significant of insurance in the amount of $1 million.

13:53.000 --> 13:58.000
So basically like you're doing a food truck festival anytime you want to play Pokemon Go in the park.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
Kinda.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
Something like that.

14:00.000 --> 14:05.000
Yeah, and really it's just, it's just really terrible.

14:05.000 --> 14:11.000
I mean, but basically the, um, a US district judge, um, put an injunction against the county in July

14:11.000 --> 14:16.000
because the ordinance was, uh, I'm actually going to quote on this,

14:16.000 --> 14:21.000
because of the strangeness and lack of sophistication of the rules, um,

14:21.000 --> 14:25.000
and that those rules infringed on first amendment rights.

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
And so the federal court said, yeah, that's totally the case.

14:28.000 --> 14:34.000
And so, uh, they wanted to move forward, uh, with the trial to, because they, you know,

14:34.000 --> 14:39.000
the county, the Milwaukee County supervisor wanted to move forward with the trial and there wasn't a trial.

14:39.000 --> 14:48.000
So basically, um, they came to an agreement, um, that the injunction against the ordinance is permanent

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
and that the municipality has to play, uh, pay Niantic's legal fees.

14:52.000 --> 14:59.000
So, um, but I mean, the good thing is that at least that's not coming out of the taxpayers.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
It's coming out of insurance.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
So just one quick thing too.

15:02.000 --> 15:10.000
I do not believe Niantic was the one that filed the lawsuit, even though they're the game that keeps getting brought up.

15:10.000 --> 15:16.000
Some other, and to be fair, I follow like lots of AR games and this is one I have not played.

15:16.000 --> 15:20.000
I subjected myself to poke to Garfield Go, which was garbage.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
It was a group called Candy Labs.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
Okay. That's it. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:23.000 --> 15:28.000
Yeah. But at any rate though, they ended up having to pay the legal fees and everything.

15:28.000 --> 15:34.000
So, well, I mean, you know, there's a part of me that wants to go good, even though I don't feel good about the,

15:34.000 --> 15:39.000
you know, people in this city for what their city council did, but at least the money's coming out of insurance.

15:39.000 --> 15:46.000
So whatever. But thank God this precedent was not allowed to be set because that would have really ruined AR gaming everywhere.

15:46.000 --> 15:55.000
You know, everything from Pokemon Go to Ingress to, you know, even, and I don't even, where would geocaching fit in with that?

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
Because like, I know there's Munzee.

15:57.000 --> 16:04.000
I don't think a lot of people have probably heard of that, but Munzee is another app that's kind of like, it's like geocaching mixed with gaming, basically.

16:04.000 --> 16:10.000
It's kind of like the bridge thing where it's basically like find these barcodes that are on stickers in your favorite places type of thing.

16:10.000 --> 16:15.000
So I worry that an ordinance like that, like where does geocaching fit in with that?

16:15.000 --> 16:19.000
Because geocaching is like a hobby for a lot of people, like there aren't even normally apps involved.

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
You know, there can be. It makes the whole process a lot easier. There doesn't have to be.

16:23.000 --> 16:35.000
So I don't know. I just, this is a precedent I'm very glad was not allowed to be set because it just, you know, if you can play chess in the park, if you can play Frisbee in the park,

16:35.000 --> 16:42.000
why can't you take out your phone and point your camera in a certain direction at the park? Doesn't make sense.

16:42.000 --> 16:58.000
Yeah. No, this is, and the other thing too, just on a side note that I was glad that the language of the, the ordinance was called into question because we've seen it with a lot of other laws that go in tax scam,

16:58.000 --> 17:04.000
where they sneak language into it. That's very ambiguous. That could be, Oh, hi smush.

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
That could be, I put him out my hand and he smushed his head into it.

17:08.000 --> 17:16.000
That was just a total, that was a moment straight out of the room. I know I did not hit her. I did not. Oh, hi smush.

17:16.000 --> 17:27.000
But, um, but I mean, the whole thing is that hopefully we get more cases that attack the language of something that, that bring into question.

17:28.000 --> 17:37.000
Ambiguity. Is that the word ambiguity in the language of, of laws so that we have a lot more ambiguity. Thank you.

17:37.000 --> 17:46.000
That we, um, that we have more scrutiny as to what sneaks its way into it. So, yeah, that I, you know, I think this is for gamers.

17:46.000 --> 17:53.000
This is definitely a win all around for city councils. This is a whole, you know, you really need to think about some of these things you're trying to make.

17:54.000 --> 18:02.000
Or, you know, if you're pissed that the citizens littered in the park, blame it on the citizens in the park and you know, this has to do with all these other stories.

18:02.000 --> 18:08.000
And I hope I'm not stepping on anything someone else wanted to talk about tonight, but because it is a shorter show, we don't have a show roll.

18:08.000 --> 18:18.000
Um, but there's this whole other story going around about how somebody is doing a, uh, a, um, study about is Pokemon go killing people and that's the clickbait headline.

18:18.000 --> 18:27.000
But what the article is really about is, is basically boils down to distracted driving. Like are people getting in more accidents where there are pokey stops and gyms because of this stuff?

18:27.000 --> 18:35.000
And it's, and here's the thing, and you know, we talked a little bit about this. Anybody that plays Pokemon go is going to die. So it has a hundred percent mortality rate.

18:35.000 --> 18:47.000
I, I would just like to point out that there are tools that are now built into most modern phones, like the do not disturb while driving, which I encourage everyone to activate.

18:47.000 --> 18:57.000
Because any type of distracted driving can potentially lead to an accident, even if it's just looking at your phone for half a second to get a direction.

18:57.000 --> 19:03.000
And it doesn't even have to be your phone. Like we all, we've all heard the story about so-and-so is doing their makeup while driving.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
Or eating.

19:04.000 --> 19:15.000
Eating is a big one. Or, um, now that everything, that these control panels are super fancy and you know, you can sometimes get distracted by pushing all the buttons on your control panel to do the radio or, you know, Spotify or whatever built into your car.

19:15.000 --> 19:25.000
You know, there's millions of ways to get distracted while driving your car. So it's just like, you know, again, if you're going to choose to play Pokemon go while you drive and you get into an accident, is that Pokemon go's fault?

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
No, it's your fault for being a moron.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
Exactly.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
Yeah.

19:29.000 --> 19:33.000
I'm sorry. Did I say that rudely? I mean, your, your fault for being a fucking moron.

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
Much better.

19:36.000 --> 19:40.000
I've got a fire today. I have a fire in my soul.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
It needs more cowbell.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
Well, I can't have caffeine, so I'm going to have to fuel it somehow.

19:44.000 --> 19:56.000
All right. Anyway, uh, so there you go at the top of the show talking about the, uh, big, uh, Pokemon go ordinance and, uh, the future of AR gaming looks good, which leads me into this whole Ingress event. Right?

19:56.000 --> 20:09.000
So we're doing Ingress and you know, uh, it was fun. We played for four hours and then we went to Niantic's after party, which I have to say it was free to get into and they give you a drink ticket as you're going in.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
Nice.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
Yeah. Right? Like right there. I was like, dang, Niantic knows how to party.

20:13.000 --> 20:25.000
And it was in a nice big space. They used the armory. The armory was where the Konami thing I went to like years ago. Right? So it was that same space, but all open and like, no, like, you know, it wasn't segmented a certain way or anything.

20:25.000 --> 20:38.000
So it was all open in there and, uh, they, you know, we, we'd had drinks and, you know, we were, you know, there was food for sale and, you know, just to be able to chat and hang out with the people from your team or, you know, even, you know, meet some people from the other team that you've been battling with for a long time.

20:38.000 --> 20:48.000
And, you know, all that. So a little bit of mixing there. And then they did some of the announcements. They came up on stage, they did the big, you know, the, the enlightened or the, the enlightened won the series because they won San Francisco.

20:48.000 --> 20:54.000
Yay. Everybody clapped and, you know, but the resistance to Kauai. So the other team can feel good, you know, to survey gets a chance to clap.

20:54.000 --> 21:07.000
And, um, so, um, they're doing all these announcements and then they, they kind of end it. So, so Ingress is supposed to be also, it's an AR game, not just because it uses real world scenarios, but because technically there's this story.

21:07.000 --> 21:25.000
That plays out online and there's a blog that you can go to. And I think the story has to do with like aliens have been discovered and one team of people, the enlightened wants to use what the aliens have to offer for the benefit of all humanity.

21:25.000 --> 21:33.000
And the blue team feels that the aliens are trying to enslave humanity. So they're trying to resist this type of change, which is why they're there, the resistance. Right.

21:33.000 --> 21:40.000
And I've totally oversimplified the story that for me just boils down to which color is prettier war, green or blue, which is why I play green.

21:40.000 --> 21:51.000
So, so anyway, uh, there, there is this whole story behind it. They have characters and everything. So they acted out this whole scene on stage. It was like watching community theater, but whatever.

21:51.000 --> 21:59.000
It's, it's fun because it's about a game that you spend a lot of time playing. And, uh, you know, the community managers are talking about some of their events that are coming up and, and one of the characters is on stage going, I have it.

21:59.000 --> 22:07.000
I have the truth. I have the, you have to show everybody the truth about the future and all this stuff and holding up something in the air. I couldn't see way in the back.

22:07.000 --> 22:16.000
So anyway, it leads to this big unveiling of the trailer for Ingress Prime, which is the new game that Niantic is working on, except it is the old game.

22:16.000 --> 22:26.000
It is basically what many of people who've been playing Ingress call Ingress 2.0. So the Pokemon Go creator Niantic, their next game is going to be their first game.

22:26.000 --> 22:38.000
And it is essentially a rewrite of the game for the ground up. That's why I call it a new game because they are rewriting Ingress from the ground up, but the game itself, not going to, it's still, you know, they're not like radically changing with the game.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
So they're going to get rid of the old game?

22:40.000 --> 22:43.000
Well, no, this is going to be, it's going to replace your old client.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
Oh.

22:44.000 --> 22:51.000
So one day you're going to go in there and update your game and it's going to be like Ingress, Ingress is now Ingress Prime 2.0. So that's, that's it.

22:51.000 --> 23:01.000
But you know, they, and they, they stressed your agent stuff will carry over your level, your badges, everything you've earned in Ingress today is carrying over to this game.

23:01.000 --> 23:08.000
But after they did the trailer, they actually said, Oh, by the way, we have some cell phones over here. We'd like you to check out Ingress Prime and tell us what you think of it.

23:08.000 --> 23:14.000
So like all of a sudden this became E3 and I was like, go stand in a line to go for 30 minutes to see a game, right? So I did that.

23:14.000 --> 23:20.000
So I got to see the Ingress Prime in motion and what was kind of cool about it is that, you know, it's definitely a huge graphic upgrade.

23:20.000 --> 23:27.000
You can, you can spin the screen with one finger instead of using, you know, the two fingers and you can go, this is what I thought was really cool.

23:27.000 --> 23:35.000
You can zoom underneath a portal so that you can see where the links are going a lot easier and see if things are crossing or not.

23:35.000 --> 23:39.000
You know how like sometimes in the game today, it's really hard to tell what the hell is linked to what?

23:39.000 --> 23:43.000
Well, they're trying to make that easier in this new client and you can zoom way out.

23:43.000 --> 23:48.000
I would say if you zoom way out, you can easily see 10 times as much area as you can now.

23:48.000 --> 23:52.000
So I thought that was kind of neat too. So, you know, as an Ingress player, that was exciting.

23:52.000 --> 24:03.000
I have some reservations about some of the things I would show, that was shown that really go into a very detailed gameplay mechanical level that I think would bore most of you because I don't think many of you playing, Chris.

24:03.000 --> 24:15.000
But I will say, you know, there was some concerns I had about something called Intel because I noticed that when they were in the, they put communications in a separate tab, one of the tabs said Intel.

24:15.000 --> 24:20.000
And I actually asked the guy, I said, are they moving Intel from the web onto the app? Is that why that says Intel?

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
And he said, I can't say anything about that. I can't show you that right now.

24:23.000 --> 24:27.000
And so that said to me, they might be.

24:27.000 --> 24:35.000
So, but to their credit, after the whole demo was over, they actually had a little laptop nearby and they said, we'd like to ask you a few questions about what you saw and how you feel.

24:35.000 --> 24:40.000
So they actually asked, you know, what's your agent level? What do you, how much do you play and all this stuff?

24:40.000 --> 24:44.000
And they said, what did you like most? What did you not like most? You know, what concerns do you have type of thing.

24:44.000 --> 24:49.000
So I was, I felt like I was appropriately able to say what I liked and say what I didn't like.

24:49.000 --> 24:58.000
And that it will be heard because, you know, although while this event was fairly crowded, it wasn't more than a couple hundred people and maybe only about a hundred stayed around and watched this demo.

24:58.000 --> 25:03.000
So, you know, they're not going to get that much feedback. So I think that's, that's kind of neat.

25:03.000 --> 25:10.000
So, yeah, so that's, I got to see the new Ingress Prime. So there you go. So again, I know a lot of you guys don't, don't play the game a lot, but I will say this.

25:10.000 --> 25:13.000
You do have this to look forward to here on OLR in the future.

25:13.000 --> 25:20.000
Some of the, um, some of the people that I play Ingress with, uh, it's, it's starting to get out there more that I do this show, this Orange Lawns Radio Show.

25:20.000 --> 25:28.000
And I've had actually a lot of the, the women that run the faction stuff here, uh, for my team in SAC, they really want to come on this show.

25:28.000 --> 25:36.000
So we are going to have, I don't know the date yet, but we are going to have a ladies of Ingress night here at OLR.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
Nice.

25:37.000 --> 25:44.000
So stay tuned for more. If I, if I can get one from the other faction, I'm open to it. So I'm not, it doesn't have to be one side of things.

25:44.000 --> 25:50.000
I'll see. I'll see what I can do. I'll see what I can do. I, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know who I can talk to over there.

25:50.000 --> 25:56.000
I see. I know one gal, actually I know one gal and if she would be willing to do it, I would really, really love to have her on. So we'll see.

25:56.000 --> 26:02.000
You don't know her, but yeah. So I know most of the people, so it's fine. Yeah. Yeah. It's all the same to you. It's all the people that smash your crap in the middle of the night.

26:02.000 --> 26:15.000
I know I probably met you once. I don't, I'm sorry. I've been getting a lot of that in comms because I'll occasionally play at the park.

26:15.000 --> 26:23.000
Oh yeah. Yeah. And they're like, Oh, Hey, long time. Like, yeah, they're excited to see somebody playing in your area because you know how your area is.

26:23.000 --> 26:31.000
I know. That's why I stopped playing. Well then I have literally no time to play. I understand. I understand. I just, I can't.

26:31.000 --> 26:39.000
I'm going to take back my work lobby. You do that. I told you there's a smurf that thinks it's his. Oh, I'm going to smack it down.

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
All right. Anyway.

26:42.000 --> 26:48.000
So that's, that's my little blurb on Ingress and what happened this weekend. And I had a really good time at the event and then they did today.

26:48.000 --> 26:54.000
They did something called mission day, which is all about doing the missions in game where you hack the portals and you, you know.

26:54.000 --> 27:00.000
So basically we explore the city and how can we get a little special badge on our profile that says you participated in mission day.

27:00.000 --> 27:05.000
But it was actually really neat. Like I had never been with all the times I've been to San Francisco cause I don't live that far from there.

27:05.000 --> 27:12.000
I had never been down the walk on pier 14 where you can walk all the way out and like get these really great pictures of the Bay bridge and stuff.

27:12.000 --> 27:18.000
So it was neat. So I did that this morning. It only took me about two hours to do what I needed to do. So yeah, it was cool.

27:18.000 --> 27:23.000
So I'm excited about that. So I had a great time doing Ingress. So I look forward for Ingress prime coming out.

27:23.000 --> 27:31.000
More information is at ingressprime.com and I believe The Verge ran an article that actually has screenshots.

27:31.000 --> 27:38.000
I think there's a trailer out there on the YouTubes as well, as well as the demo I saw somebody filmed it, even though it's a big no-no.

27:38.000 --> 27:43.000
So there is a leaked demo on YouTube out there where you can watch the whole thing if you're curious about it. So there you go.

27:43.000 --> 27:48.000
And if you want to know more about Ingress, if you want to play Ingress, I'm happy to help you out if you go green.

27:49.000 --> 27:57.000
All right. Anyway, uh, let's get into some, uh, talk about our gaming weeks, the types of video games we have been playing this week.

27:57.000 --> 28:02.000
I guess I've already talked a lot about Ingress that kind of dominated my weekend, but I know you guys have been playing other stuff, right, Jamie?

28:02.000 --> 28:13.000
I'm actually restarting Animal Crossing New Leaf because apparently there is support for my weird idea about a person having a mental breakdown and finds herself in the world of Animal Crossing.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
Okay, I believe that.

28:15.000 --> 28:18.000
Where she has a nightly existential crisis at the roost.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
Mm-hmm.

28:19.000 --> 28:30.000
So, I was gonna do it, I actually, um, have the Dolphin emulator, and I was gonna do it on, um, the N64 version so I could take screenshots with that.

28:30.000 --> 28:37.000
Um, I mean, and again, I own all of the originals, blah blah blah blah blah, all the stuff. Um, sorry, GameCube version.

28:37.000 --> 28:44.000
Um, but, I'm thinking that I like the newer character styles, plus there's more locations in the game that I can do stuff with.

28:44.000 --> 28:58.000
So, um, the one thing is that I'm actually trying to find, like, a, and I know that they exist, but sort of like a, uh, a simulated version that I can use, like, direct camera angles in and everything.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
I found all the textures from New Leaf.

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
So, the textures in the, in the character model.

29:03.000 --> 29:07.000
So, anyway, that's been kind of my thing lately, and I'm playing a lot to Pocket Camp. I'm level 34.

29:07.000 --> 29:12.000
Would it be fair to say that the mobile, you're level 34?

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
Yes.

29:13.000 --> 29:21.000
Okay, I guess I can't talk because I just literally played Ingress all weekend long, so I literally cannot say anything, but I did have a pause moment of shock.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
All right, that's great.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
I checked the game three times a day.

29:24.000 --> 29:28.000
That's, no, that's, I, again, I can't fucking talk. I played Ingress all weekend.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
I'm building a convertible right now for Cherry.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
That's to get her past-

29:31.000 --> 29:38.000
You have to build them fucking cars? Like, the, the couches and the, the refrigerators? That's not enough? You have to make them a fucking car?

29:38.000 --> 29:43.000
Apollo wants a bass guitar, so I'm doing a bass for him. I'm on my fourth loan.

29:43.000 --> 29:46.000
You had to take out a loan to build a bitch a car?

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
No!

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
What is this game teaching people?

29:48.000 --> 29:51.000
No, it's for my, my van, my camper, my van again.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
All right.

29:52.000 --> 30:02.000
Um, but I have the 150,000 Bell loan right now, and I was, I was actually thinking about using the mobile version for my, my thing, but-

30:02.000 --> 30:14.000
Okay, so I was gonna say, would it be fair to say that because of the mobile Animal Crossing, you've been thinking more about Animal Crossing, and therefore, that has led to, maybe I want to go back and play New Leaf and do this comic thing.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
I've had the idea to do the webcomic for about two years now.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
Okay.

30:17.000 --> 30:30.000
Um, but I just never put anything to it. I was either gonna hand draw it, you know, which I could still do it hand drawn, but I think it would be a little bit more fun to have screenshots, or at least get some of the locations or something, I don't know.

30:30.000 --> 30:57.000
I'm still working out the, the logistics behind it, but, um, I've also been playing Miitomo, and I played some Ingress, because, uh, reasons, and, um, uh, Pokemon Go, and, uh, Idol Poring, and Dragon Age Inquisition, and, um, um, and fucking with people's heads.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
All right, it's a fun game.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
All right, Loki, how was your gaming week?

31:01.000 --> 31:21.000
Um, it wasn't as fun as I thought it was gonna be, but, um, I, I played, or I finished the story campaign for LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2, and much like, um, god, there was another game I played that was kind of like this too, but it just kind of, it was just over.

31:21.000 --> 31:25.000
Like, all of a sudden been playing through levels and all of a sudden it's just done.

31:25.000 --> 31:28.000
I was like, that was it? That was the last level?

31:28.000 --> 31:42.000
It's just very, I don't know, there wasn't any real memorable moments like there were with even the first LEGO Marvel Super Heroes game, and even the LEGO Avengers game, they had, but it seemed like they put more time into the story and stuff.

31:42.000 --> 31:59.000
This one just seems very rushed and content lacking, I mean, because if you look at the LEGO Avengers game, I didn't like that one too much because instead of doing voice acting for a lot of the characters, they just took audio clips from the movies that they're in, because it's based on the Marvel movie universe.

31:59.000 --> 32:07.000
And so, it was just kind of like, eh, I like the old voice actors better, and I just really wish they'd used those instead.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
I wonder if that has to do with the strike.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
It could have been, maybe.

32:11.000 --> 32:18.000
This time though, they did voice actors, they didn't use the same old voice actors, so that was kind of jarring.

32:18.000 --> 32:31.000
But, with the last game, the LEGO Avengers game, they had all these hub worlds, and they had Manhattan, because usually you get one giant hub world that you can run around, it's kind of free roaming and stuff, and you can do puzzles and stuff in there, plus they have all the levels.

32:31.000 --> 32:38.000
Well, this one had that, and then it had all these other hub worlds that were kind of cool as well, so there's like a lot of content in there.

32:38.000 --> 32:49.000
This one doesn't have that. This one has the stupid Chronopolis thing, which is just like tiny pieces of each of these little worlds just jumbled together in this big mess of a world.

32:49.000 --> 32:53.000
It's just kind of crap, and it's just very unmemorable and just dumb.

32:53.000 --> 32:56.000
And the storyline to the whole thing was kind of lame, too.

32:56.000 --> 33:03.000
The only thing that was good about it was they had some pretty good boss fights. I think they're interesting designs.

33:03.000 --> 33:11.000
But, it's just like the Kang character is just very lame. Just the boss fight at the end was kind of stupid.

33:11.000 --> 33:23.000
Because he fights Captain America, and Captain America gets big for some reason, like this giant kaiju fight almost, and it should have been cool, but it was pretty lame.

33:23.000 --> 33:29.000
So, I don't know. But, I still have to play through it to unlock all the characters and do all that.

33:29.000 --> 33:33.000
But, it seems like it's more of a chore now than anything, just because my kids want to play it.

33:33.000 --> 33:39.000
I didn't get to play any of the VR stuff. I kept looking at it, but once again, my wife is very much monopolizing the TV.

33:39.000 --> 33:48.000
And there's not a really good place to set up VR while she's watching TV and have it not interfere with the TV.

33:48.000 --> 33:51.000
So, unfortunately, I didn't get around to that.

33:52.000 --> 34:02.000
Also, I did play a little bit more of LEGO DC Universe 2, which was LEGO Batman to DC Universe.

34:02.000 --> 34:06.000
I'm really trying to get away from LEGO games, though, because I've got a lot of other stuff to play.

34:06.000 --> 34:10.000
South Park! I still have South Park. I bought that, downloaded it, haven't played it yet.

34:10.000 --> 34:15.000
But, I do want to get into that. I just wanted to finish the one game first before I got started on something else.

34:16.000 --> 34:21.000
So, I'll probably do that, but I'm very much looking forward to playing South Park. I hear it's really good.

34:21.000 --> 34:24.000
Alright. I understand the struggle of having a game that you haven't played yet.

34:24.000 --> 34:31.000
I got my copy of Xenoblade Chronicles 2 on Friday, and I haven't even opened the package yet.

34:31.000 --> 34:36.000
Because I left Friday night, and I've been being a nerd on other stuff all weekend long.

34:36.000 --> 34:40.000
So, hoping to maybe get into that a little bit tonight, if I don't just pass out early.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
But, if nothing else, I'll start playing that tomorrow.

34:42.000 --> 34:45.000
I've got six to eight VR games I have yet to play.

34:45.000 --> 34:53.000
Like, I've got just a ton of stuff that I bought over sales and stuff, and I've been meaning to play all of it.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
I just haven't gotten around to playing it yet.

34:56.000 --> 35:03.000
Alright. My gaming week. I have not played a lot besides Ingress this weekend, obviously. It was a lot.

35:03.000 --> 35:08.000
Well, actually, I was staying with our pal JD, who you see in chat a lot, and he's been on the show before.

35:08.000 --> 35:13.000
And he was showing me Jackbox 4, which somehow, I hadn't gotten around to picking up yet.

35:13.000 --> 35:17.000
I don't know, like, I haven't had people over, so that hasn't been a reason for me to download it yet.

35:17.000 --> 35:18.000
I'm sure I'll get it eventually.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
But he was like, have you played Jackbox 4 yet?

35:20.000 --> 35:23.000
And I was like, actually, now that you mention it, no I haven't.

35:23.000 --> 35:29.000
And I always support the Jackbox games, so it's weird that I kind of, like, this one just slipped on my radar.

35:29.000 --> 35:34.000
So he fired it up so we could play Fibbage 3, which I really, that was really the only game we got to play.

35:34.000 --> 35:40.000
He was telling me about some of the other games, like the monster, the game that sounds like it's freaking Grindr, but with monsters, and that's really funny.

35:40.000 --> 35:45.000
And I would really like to invite Jackbox back on the show, because I want to know if they did research by using dating apps.

35:45.000 --> 35:49.000
But anyway, there's all these other fun games in there.

35:49.000 --> 35:55.000
But I got to play Fibbage 3, and that was great, because it has, like, this very, like, 70s look to it.

35:55.000 --> 36:06.000
And I love the little transition, uses, transitions when you're picking the category, uses all these stock photography from the 70s of, like, women in 70s style bathing suits,

36:06.000 --> 36:12.000
and men with the big bushy mustache, Burt Reynolds mustaches and stuff that is, like, the horrible fashion of the 70s, what looks horrible now.

36:12.000 --> 36:17.000
You know, and all that stuff. I just, I got a kick out of the look and how that whole game looked.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
And they tried to do some new things with the formula, too.

36:19.000 --> 36:23.000
I mean, it's still Fibbage at the end of the day, but I like that they had, like, social media questions.

36:23.000 --> 36:28.000
Like, one of the questions we had was some supermodel had posted on her Twitter,

36:28.000 --> 36:33.000
I'm trying to set blank as my desktop picture, and you had to, you know, fill in the blank with what it was.

36:33.000 --> 36:37.000
And I fooled JD, I put Obama, and he guessed it. He guessed it was Obama.

36:37.000 --> 36:41.000
And I think the real answer was her boobs. Yeah, the real answer was her boobs.

36:41.000 --> 36:44.000
And I thought, oh, the game's not going to put her boobs in there.

36:44.000 --> 36:48.000
And I think I put the runway or something really dumb that somebody else had put in.

36:48.000 --> 36:52.000
And yeah, the answer, it turns out, she had tweeted that she wanted to put her boobs as her background picture.

36:52.000 --> 36:55.000
Would you ever do that, DarkSagra? No.

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
Fuck no.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
No, I wouldn't put my butt as my background picture, either.

36:58.000 --> 37:01.000
It's just a little bit, I guess, you know, supermodels are different.

37:01.000 --> 37:04.000
I think I could put supermodel's boobs as my background picture.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
That's not the same thing.

37:09.000 --> 37:13.000
Anyway, so that was something I got to learn playing Fibbage.

37:13.000 --> 37:18.000
Oh, and then the bonus round was different, because the bonus round was blank and blank.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
So it was like a pair of things that went together.

37:21.000 --> 37:28.000
And I think it was something about Richard Nixon's food you would never guess that he liked was blank and blank.

37:28.000 --> 37:31.000
And I don't know, I put something disgusting, like peanut butter and pickles or something.

37:31.000 --> 37:34.000
And I think I actually did, I tricked JD again.

37:34.000 --> 37:37.000
And you might think I'm a really good liar, but he was a better liar, actually.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
I fell for his answer like every fucking time.

37:39.000 --> 37:44.000
Turns out, did you know the real answer, I mean, spoiler alert, but did you know the real answer to that is ketchup and cottage cheese?

37:44.000 --> 37:45.000
Ew.

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
Yeah, right? Disgusting.

37:46.000 --> 37:50.000
My granddaddy used to eat ketchup on everything, including cabbage.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.000
And cottage cheese?

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
And cottage cheese and eggs.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
I don't know about that. Alright.

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
Anyway.

37:56.000 --> 38:01.000
So that's a pretty awesome looking, I'm watching the leaked footage of the, uh...

38:01.000 --> 38:02.000
Oh, the Ingress 2.0?

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
Ingress 2.0.

38:03.000 --> 38:04.000
Yeah, and I told you about that?

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
Yeah, or Ingress Prime.

38:05.000 --> 38:08.000
It's pretty, it's so much, but it's pretty.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
It's very, like, what drew me to Ingress...

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
It looks a lot cooler, I guess.

38:12.000 --> 38:15.000
What drew me to Ingress in the first place was I was like, oh, it looks like Tron, but in the real world.

38:15.000 --> 38:18.000
And now that I'm looking at Ingress Prime, I'm like, now it really looks like Tron.

38:18.000 --> 38:19.000
Yeah.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
It's very cool. Anyway.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
Um, and then I played some World of Warcraft.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
Not a lot, but a little bit.

38:24.000 --> 38:28.000
And, um, I don't know, it's just some other little stuff here and there, and that's really about it.

38:28.000 --> 38:32.000
So, um, this next week I'm looking forward to actually sending out my Xenoblade Chronicles 2,

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
because I bought that, but I just haven't got started yet.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
So I'm hoping to get into that.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
Um, so that was it for my gaming week.

38:38.000 --> 38:41.000

38:56.000 --> 39:00.000
I'm curious what kind of games you guys might play outdoors.

39:00.000 --> 39:03.000
You know, we talked about Ingress, Pokemon Go.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
Is there another AR game that you're into?

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
Well, it's not an AR game.

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
Don't send in sports as a joke answer.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
Like, I get that that's an obvious answer.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
I mean, technology-based thing.

39:12.000 --> 39:15.000
They have one that's, I don't know how well this would work,

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
but it's supposed to be like laser tag.

39:17.000 --> 39:21.000
I've seen like the guns at the store you can buy,

39:21.000 --> 39:24.000
and they've got like an app that you, it works with,

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
and it's like you play laser tag with that.

39:26.000 --> 39:30.000
I just like, I can't imagine that would be very good.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
Eww.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
Apparently, DarkSakurai agrees.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.000
Eww.

39:35.000 --> 39:36.000
Okay, so this is why-

39:36.000 --> 39:37.000
Ketchup is gross.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
No, I want to point this out. I want to point this out.

39:39.000 --> 39:42.000
Rama has just reinforced single-handedly in our chat

39:42.000 --> 39:45.000
over at live.bognetwork.com why we don't click random links,

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
and I made the mistake because I go, oh, it's Rama.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
He's not going to Rickroll me in the middle of the show.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
Rama knows better. He produces his own show.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
So what did he fucking put in chat?

39:53.000 --> 39:56.000
A tweet of a Pop-Tart covered in ketchup.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
Eww.

39:57.000 --> 40:01.000
So, in the future, when I don't click your links in chat during the show,

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
I want you to go and say, thanks, Rama.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.000
Thanks for that.

40:04.000 --> 40:07.000
That's, yes, just remember the ketchup covered Pop-Tart

40:07.000 --> 40:08.000
that made Rob not click the links anymore.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
Pizza, Pop-Tart, or something like that.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
I thought they had, like, something like that.

40:11.000 --> 40:15.000
If it's possible on the internet, I'm sure they did it somewhere.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
All right.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
Let's get into some other news.

40:18.000 --> 40:21.000
DarkSakurai, I know you had a few things you want to bring to the table tonight.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
DarkSakurai, why don't you start us off with some news.

40:23.000 --> 40:27.000
Osaka has new ambassadors. It's Pikachu and Hello Kitty.

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
Why can America not have cool stuff?

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
Why, Japan?

40:32.000 --> 40:35.000
I'm moving because I want-

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
Well, one of our buddies is there right now.

40:37.000 --> 40:40.000
Yeah, buddy, give me a place to live.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
Actually, I'll be perfectly honest.

40:42.000 --> 40:47.000
My goal ages and ages ago was to live in Kyoto.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
Still kind of a goal.

40:48.000 --> 40:53.000
You know, if something happens to Dan, you may be doing OLR across the ocean.

40:53.000 --> 40:56.000
But I just think it's pretty cool.

40:56.000 --> 41:02.000
They basically are promoting Osaka as the 2025 ex-Boho city.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
So that's pretty cool.

41:04.000 --> 41:07.000
And I have completely different news, too.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
It's about Cuphead.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.000
Okay.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
You know how Cuphead is hard as balls?

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
Yeah, why, yes I do.

41:14.000 --> 41:15.000
Actually, balls aren't really hard.

41:15.000 --> 41:18.000
I was able to beat the tutorial, though, which is why I'm allowed to do this program.

41:18.000 --> 41:19.000
Yeah.

41:19.000 --> 41:24.000
Well, Cuphead got a patch to polish it up just a teensy more.

41:24.000 --> 41:29.000
And it basically did away with some of the little bugs that people found.

41:29.000 --> 41:34.000
Like replicating Mugman many, many times.

41:34.000 --> 41:37.000
Does that mean they made the game harder?

41:37.000 --> 41:38.000
Yes.

41:38.000 --> 41:39.000
Because you can't exploit it anymore.

41:39.000 --> 41:40.000
They can't cheat.

41:40.000 --> 41:43.000
It actually, in some ways, made things a little bit easier, too.

41:43.000 --> 41:46.000
So it fixed random freezes.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.000
Yeah, that's good.

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
And it improved saving and loading.

41:49.000 --> 41:53.000
There's nothing more infuriating than a difficult video game

41:53.000 --> 41:57.000
than a difficult video game where you lose all your progress thanks to a freeze.

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
So that does make the process easier.

41:59.000 --> 42:07.000
It left the ability to charge your weapon as maintained through parry.

42:07.000 --> 42:13.000
And you can unequip your secondary weapons from the equipment menu.

42:13.000 --> 42:17.000
And just fixing a lot of weird little glitches on there.

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
It fixed some of the hit boxes.

42:19.000 --> 42:25.000
And yeah, a few things worse, a few things better.

42:25.000 --> 42:28.000
Loki, I think you should put that on your list of things to play as Cuphead.

42:28.000 --> 42:29.000
I have played Cuphead.

42:29.000 --> 42:30.000
Have you?

42:30.000 --> 42:31.000
I didn't realize that.

42:31.000 --> 42:32.000
Yeah, it's fun.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
I'm wrestling here at the show a few weeks ago.

42:34.000 --> 42:35.000
I need to play it more.

42:35.000 --> 42:36.000
I played a little bit on Twitch that one night,

42:36.000 --> 42:40.000
and I played a little more after that, but I need to try to finish it.

42:40.000 --> 42:41.000
It's really fun.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
Yeah, it definitely is difficult.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
I've watched all the boss videos and stuff like that.

42:45.000 --> 42:48.000
It's one of those games that's going to get completely lost

42:48.000 --> 42:52.000
in these end of the year game award stuff because of Zelda and Mario.

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
I don't know if it will.

42:54.000 --> 42:58.000
Well, it didn't get nominated for a game of the year, anyway.

42:58.000 --> 43:01.000
I would have expected this game to be game of the year material for a lot of people.

43:01.000 --> 43:02.000
I really do.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
I don't know.

43:04.000 --> 43:07.000
Well, certainly when it comes to art direction and style.

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
It doesn't have the replayability for that, I don't think.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
But that's not a bad thing, though.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
That's like Mega Man.

43:13.000 --> 43:16.000
I mean, it has Mega Man replayability, whereas it's linear.

43:16.000 --> 43:21.000
Okay, speaking of Mega Man, when I first played Mega Man 2 on the NES,

43:22.000 --> 43:25.000
I had that moment of, oh, my God, I'm playing a cartoon.

43:25.000 --> 43:29.000
When you see some of those sprites playing, I'm playing a fucking cartoon.

43:29.000 --> 43:34.000
But then when I played Cuphead, no, really, I am fucking playing a cartoon right now.

43:34.000 --> 43:41.000
It's another example of one of those, just when you think graphics can't get any better, here you go.

43:41.000 --> 43:46.000
And it's not that the graphics are particularly anything more stunning than, say, Destiny 2,

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
which is a great graphical game in a different way.

43:48.000 --> 43:52.000
But Cuphead, because of that art direction and the art style they picked,

43:52.000 --> 43:55.000
it looks like something they picked straight up out of the 30s.

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
It's pretty astounding.

43:57.000 --> 44:00.000
So if you haven't played Cuphead, you really should check it out.

44:00.000 --> 44:03.000
I worry it's one of those games that most people will watch on Twitch

44:03.000 --> 44:07.000
and be like, nah, I'm not going to play that, but it looks good.

44:07.000 --> 44:11.000
Well, looks good isn't going to give the developers incentive to make another one.

44:11.000 --> 44:15.000
Although I heard it did sell very well, so we're probably going to get another one.

44:15.000 --> 44:18.000
Or at least that studio will get the opportunity to make another game

44:18.000 --> 44:22.000
that hopefully has a great style of whatever it is they choose.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
All right, I think that is that all you had, Dark Soccer?

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
Let's go to Loki for a few more stories.

44:28.000 --> 44:33.000
Including, why don't you tell us about the breakfast box that's getting tweeted everywhere right now.

44:33.000 --> 44:37.000
Well, I was going to talk about that in a second, but first I want to actually talk about...

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
Fine, no, I'm just kidding.

44:39.000 --> 44:43.000
Well, since we were talking about Mega Man, I wanted to mention that there is a Mega Man anniversary

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
thing that's going to be happening tomorrow.

44:45.000 --> 44:50.000
So on December 4th, Capcom is actually going to be doing a live stream of Mega Man

44:50.000 --> 44:53.000
for the 30th anniversary of the Mega Man series.

44:53.000 --> 44:58.000
And so it's going to start at, looks like 11 a.m. Pacific time.

44:58.000 --> 45:03.000
And they said one hour prior to the stream, they're going to be airing a streamer showdown pre-show

45:03.000 --> 45:06.000
with trivia and guest appearances of that.

45:06.000 --> 45:09.000
So my guess is they're going to announce something during this.

45:09.000 --> 45:12.000
Did you hear about who retweeted that tweet?

45:12.000 --> 45:20.000
No, Sony and Nintendo both retweeted that tweet.

45:20.000 --> 45:23.000
So, draw the conclusion that you will.

45:23.000 --> 45:27.000
There's a lot of people theorizing that the conclusion, a lot of people jumping into,

45:27.000 --> 45:32.000
Mega Man Legacy Collection on the Switch, which would be great.

45:32.000 --> 45:38.000
I think that's something, you know, I still have not bought that Saturday morning Disney game collection

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
because I want it on the Switch.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
Maybe the Mega Man collection thing will come out on the Switch.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
I think that would be great if it did.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
Or maybe they're going to do Mega Man 11.

45:46.000 --> 45:50.000
Maybe they're going to do some big thing tomorrow.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
Mega Man Legends Collection.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
I'm kind of okay with that actually.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
One and two, I mean.

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
Or an X collection even. I don't know. So we'll see.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
I mean, it could be literally anything tomorrow. So we'll see.

46:00.000 --> 46:01.000
Yeah, that'd be cool.

46:01.000 --> 46:02.000
Excited about that.

46:02.000 --> 46:03.000
That's something.

46:03.000 --> 46:06.000
But yes, to allude to what Rob was talking about earlier,

46:06.000 --> 46:10.000
there is, of course, a brand new cereal hitting the market.

46:10.000 --> 46:14.000
It's the Super Mario Brothers Cereal.

46:14.000 --> 46:15.000
It's for breakfast now.

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
Nintendo, it's a cereal.

46:17.000 --> 46:18.000
Wow.

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
So they've got this new cereal that's coming out.

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
It's I guess through Kellogg's.

46:22.000 --> 46:29.000
And it's what's kind of unique about it aside from the fact that it's got Mario Brothers marshmallows and stuff like that in there.

46:29.000 --> 46:32.000
And we all know marshmallows are the best part of any breakfast.

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
Marshmallows are disgusting. You shut your mouth.

46:35.000 --> 46:39.000
Even the gross dehydrated marshmallows you get in breakfast cereal.

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
I love the dehydrated ones in.

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
Here's my problem.

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
Now I'm going to derail you, you son of a bitch.

46:45.000 --> 46:46.000
That's fine.

46:46.000 --> 46:47.000
Go right ahead.

46:47.000 --> 46:51.000
I don't. Okay, this is where everybody's going to go, Rob, you are a fucking freak. You ready?

46:51.000 --> 46:55.000
I don't like milk and cereal at all.

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
And so people go, well, how do you eat your cereal?

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
And I go, easy.

46:59.000 --> 47:02.000
You put it in a bowl, you get a spoon, and you eat the cereal out of the bowl.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
You don't need anything in it.

47:04.000 --> 47:11.000
But in those types of cereals where you have dehydrated parts in it, it kind of makes those marshmallows a little bit nastier, I think.

47:11.000 --> 47:14.000
It makes them slimy if you like put milk in there.

47:14.000 --> 47:15.000
Yeah.

47:15.000 --> 47:20.000
But I like them when they're dehydrated and you kind of chew on them and it's like chewing through like high density foam or something like that.

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
See, I wouldn't know. I don't like milk and cereal.

47:25.000 --> 47:28.000
Maybe I'm lactose intolerant.

47:28.000 --> 47:29.000
Sometimes.

47:29.000 --> 47:35.000
I'm actually not, but I just don't, I don't, I don't like that much milk. That's the problem.

47:35.000 --> 47:45.000
Well, sometimes this is why I do too. Like if you don't like tons of milk and cereal, you get a giant like oversized cup of cereal and a glass of milk and you just down the cereal first.

47:45.000 --> 47:50.000
And you eat it and then you drink some milk when your mouth gets too dry.

47:50.000 --> 47:53.000
For some reason, that I'm okay with.

47:53.000 --> 47:59.000
I've done that like cause there's some cereals that are better dry than they are with milk.

47:59.000 --> 48:05.000
For example, one that I feel really loses all of its flavor in milk is Cinnamon Toast Crunch.

48:05.000 --> 48:11.000
Cause all the cinnamon gets washed off and you have this like lame ass soggy shit with some cinnamon on it.

48:11.000 --> 48:14.000
This is the best part of OLR is knowing you're not alone.

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
SSG100Matt says, Rob, you're not alone.

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
And Dark Tetsuya says, I don't blame you Rob.

48:18.000 --> 48:22.000
And JD says, what do you do instead? Use orange juice?

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
You're all gross.

48:24.000 --> 48:27.000
Well, clearly the answer is we use ketchup.

48:27.000 --> 48:30.000
Ketchup is also gross.

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
Why do people eat disgusting things?

48:32.000 --> 48:33.000
Soy sauce?

48:33.000 --> 48:38.000
That's what I ask when Loki brings a fucking sandwich from Subway loaded with extra mayo.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
But I love mayo.

48:40.000 --> 48:44.000
Here's why I ask for extra mayo. It's because of their own incompetence.

48:44.000 --> 48:47.000
It's not because I like a ton of mayo on my sandwich.

48:47.000 --> 48:52.000
It's because I want the ratio of mayo to be greater than the amount of mustard they put on there.

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
Cause otherwise the mustard just overpowers everything.

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
What's the problem? I love mustard.

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
You put light on the mustard.

48:58.000 --> 48:59.000
Mustard is also gross.

48:59.000 --> 49:02.000
They just go way crazy with the mustard and mayo on there.

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
So I have to ask them to put extra mayo.

49:04.000 --> 49:07.000
And I mean a little bit extra mayo, but then they go fucking crazy with it.

49:07.000 --> 49:10.000
Like there's just like a two inch thick layer of mayo in there.

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
I was like, dude, that's a little much.

49:12.000 --> 49:15.000
I literally just gagged. I literally just gagged.

49:16.000 --> 49:19.000
Sorry, I didn't mean to give you that mental picture, but...

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
It's just, it's their own incompetence.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
Just make the sandwich like I want it.

49:25.000 --> 49:26.000
It's not so hard.

49:26.000 --> 49:29.000
Alright, where the hell were we? God damn it, you derailed everything.

49:29.000 --> 49:30.000
Cereal. Oh yeah, cereal.

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
So what else about Super Mario cereal?

49:32.000 --> 49:38.000
So the thing that's unique about it though is it has an amiibo thing on it.

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
Yes, the cereal box is its own amiibo.

49:40.000 --> 49:44.000
Can't really store it with the rest of your amiibos, but hey, you can at least scan the box.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
Yeah, all you need is a little chip, right?

49:46.000 --> 49:52.000
Yeah, you can scan the box with your Nintendo Switch controller or Joy-Con or whatever and do that.

49:52.000 --> 50:00.000
Or you can totally be the lead hacker because your Switch is fucking portable and just go to the fucking supermarket and scan all the boxes with your Switch.

50:00.000 --> 50:01.000
Smart man.

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
Without even having to buy the cereal.

50:03.000 --> 50:07.000
That's right, because they can't afford to put that chip, that wrap on everything, huh?

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
Yeah, you can't do anything. You can't do shit with that.

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
It's just fucking just go to the store and...

50:11.000 --> 50:15.000
Did you really think of that yourself or did you see somebody on Twitter or YouTube do that where they went to the supermarket?

50:15.000 --> 50:20.000
No, I thought about it because when I saw that I'm like, well, what's going to stop people from just going to the store and doing that?

50:20.000 --> 50:23.000
Do you want to go to Save Mart, get my Switch, go to Save Mart right now?

50:23.000 --> 50:27.000
I don't even know if it's out there. I didn't see it at the store.

50:29.000 --> 50:30.000
Oh my god, I love it.

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
I thought about stopping the store and getting some, but...

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
Well, I mean, it makes sense to it. Like, I was...

50:34.000 --> 50:39.000
Okay, so everybody's thinking about like figures. Like, do you get a toy in your food again?

50:39.000 --> 50:44.000
No. Think of the amiibo cards, you guys. They had the Animal Crossing amiibo cards, okay?

50:44.000 --> 50:47.000
So they just made the bottom of the box or whatever, one of those cards.

50:47.000 --> 50:52.000
Well, is it built into the box or is there a card in the box?

50:52.000 --> 50:57.000
Like in little individual wrap? Because if that's the case, Loki, your trick's not going to work.

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
Because maybe they just put an amiibo card in the box.

50:59.000 --> 51:02.000
I thought it was attached to the back of the box, but I could be wrong. I don't know.

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
It would make sense. We'll see.

51:04.000 --> 51:08.000
Alright, Bobby Black Wolf in chat says it's out on the 11th or something.

51:08.000 --> 51:12.000
And Black Wolf says they claim that the amiibo part is on the back of the box.

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
Alright, so it's a giant amiibo card, basically.

51:15.000 --> 51:16.000
Interesting.

51:16.000 --> 51:21.000
Yeah. And apparently, what it does is it gives you gold coins or hearts.

51:22.000 --> 51:27.000
Oh, and Akuma JP says in Japan, they have an aluminum sticker over the chip.

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
You have to peel it to scan it.

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
Well, I'm going to tell you right now.

51:32.000 --> 51:36.000
Akuma JP, I know there's some cultural differences here, but here's my question.

51:36.000 --> 51:39.000
Do you have a store called Walmart in Japan?

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
Because I'm going to tell you what's going to happen.

51:41.000 --> 51:42.000
They have Costco.

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
I'm going to tell you what's going to happen here in the US.

51:44.000 --> 51:48.000
You're going to go look at that cereal aisle and all that fucking aluminum will have been peeled back already.

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
I don't know why. It's just random.

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
And it's something specific about Walmarts.

51:56.000 --> 51:57.000
It's quality of customer.

51:58.000 --> 51:59.000
It's the culture.

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
Do they still have that blog, People of Walmart?

52:03.000 --> 52:04.000
I'm sure they do.

52:04.000 --> 52:09.000
Ok, Akuma, if you want to see what America's like, go look for the blog called People of Walmart.

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
And that's what it's like living here.

52:14.000 --> 52:18.000
Alright, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, sir, put the switch away.

52:19.000 --> 52:23.000
They're not going to yell at me at the grocery store over having a Nintendo Switch out.

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
Especially if, no, here's what I'll do.

52:26.000 --> 52:27.000
I know what I'll do.

52:27.000 --> 52:28.000
This is how I don't get yelled at.

52:29.000 --> 52:32.000
I will let a child that I've kidnapped hold the switch.

52:34.000 --> 52:35.000
That way I won't get yelled at.

52:36.000 --> 52:37.000
That's a good idea, right?

52:37.000 --> 52:40.000
Because you're not going to yell at my pretend kid for bringing the switch.

52:41.000 --> 52:45.000
Child kidnapping, well, geez, you're just lining up right for Congress, you know?

52:46.000 --> 52:47.000
You have what it takes to be in politics.

52:48.000 --> 52:49.000
Vote Rob Roberts 2020.

52:50.000 --> 52:51.000
What do I have to say?

52:53.000 --> 52:58.000
Alright, Vidpower in chat says, the amiibo prize for scanning the cereal box doesn't seem too amazing.

52:59.000 --> 53:00.000
You get, like, a heart.

53:01.000 --> 53:05.000
Dungeonbuster in chat says, we have a switch in aisle 4, repeat, security, we have a switch in aisle 4.

53:06.000 --> 53:12.000
And Akuma JP regarding Walmart says, I see it on YouTube, my eyes roll so hard.

53:13.000 --> 53:18.000
And SSJ100 Matt says, dress Mr. Smoosh as a kid and put him in a stroller.

53:19.000 --> 53:23.000
The sad thing is he probably, Mr. Smoosh would probably do it.

53:27.000 --> 53:28.000
I love it.

53:29.000 --> 53:36.000
Bobby Blackwolf says, yeah, it just tells you that you have a delicious amiibo and it finds a power moon like all the other amiibo do.

53:37.000 --> 53:38.000
So, there you go.

53:39.000 --> 53:43.000
Alright, but that's, I mean, I almost think, I don't even think the amiibo thing's that big a deal.

53:44.000 --> 53:45.000
Like, I really don't.

53:45.000 --> 53:50.000
I think it's more like, hey, hey, Nintendo cereal is, like, coming back. Like, it's, I mean, it's not the same cereal.

53:51.000 --> 53:57.000
That's so cool, though. It would be even cooler, like, if it unlocked a cereal box character skin for Super Mario Maker or something.

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
What the fuck? A cereal Mario skin?

54:01.000 --> 54:02.000
Yeah, cereal box.

54:03.000 --> 54:06.000
Whatever, they have, like, springboards and shit in there.

54:07.000 --> 54:10.000
A cardboard, you want, like, solid snake hiding in a cardboard box Mario?

54:10.000 --> 54:18.000
Like, I want a cereal box. I mean, what, they've got, like, you can do the, like, warp pipes and question blocks and in the springs and stuff like that, so why not?

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
Yeah, when I think of Mario Brothers, I think of cereal, yeah.

54:22.000 --> 54:25.000
It's Super Mario Maker and they have a bunch of weird shit in there.

54:28.000 --> 54:31.000
Alright, no, it's, it's, I'm just teasing you, it's fine. Alright, what else? New story.

54:32.000 --> 54:41.000
Alright, so, we can talk a little bit briefly about more EA shit. So, this is still kind of off of the whole Star Wars Battlefront II bullshit.

54:42.000 --> 54:49.000
So, of course, you know, in response to the, you know, backlash against it is more excuses on why they didn't do things the way they did.

54:50.000 --> 55:00.000
So, one thing they said is, well, we couldn't possibly do Battlefront II cosmetics in the loot boxes because it would break the canon.

55:01.000 --> 55:04.000
It would break the canon of Star Wars. Except...

55:05.000 --> 55:06.000
Like, they haven't rewritten it 50,000 times.

55:07.000 --> 55:15.000
Well, except that they had customization in the last game. They have customization hidden in the code of this game.

55:16.000 --> 55:22.000
And there's also the stupid Star Wars Kinect game, which just broke all of the canons, so, whatever.

55:23.000 --> 55:28.000
Would you please reference the quote about Pink Darth Vader? Because that's the one that pissed me the fuck off.

55:28.000 --> 55:31.000
Uh, yes. Let me see if I can actually find that.

55:32.000 --> 55:37.000
He said something like, you wouldn't want to play as Pink Darth Vader. And my reaction was-

55:38.000 --> 55:39.000
Bitch, I would.

55:40.000 --> 55:45.000
The fuck I wouldn't. Like, maybe I would buy this fucking game if I could play as Pink Darth Vader. That sounds fucking rad.

55:46.000 --> 55:54.000
Yeah, unfortunately, this article does not have the quote in there, but basically it was something to the effect of, like, yes, White Darth Vader would, you know, break the canon.

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
And no one wants to play as Pink Darth Vader or something like that.

55:58.000 --> 56:03.000
You shut your dirty little mouth. I know lots of people that would play as Pink Darth Vader.

56:04.000 --> 56:09.000
So, it was just like, um, yeah, let's see. Okay, I think I have the exact one here, so, let's see.

56:10.000 --> 56:17.000
So, one thing we're very focused on and extremely focused on is not violating the canon of Star Wars.

56:18.000 --> 56:26.000
It's an amazing brand that's been built over many, many years, and so if you did a bunch of cosmetic things, you might start to violate canon, right?

56:26.000 --> 56:32.000
Darth Vader in white probably doesn't make sense versus black, not to mention you probably don't want Darth Vader in pink.

56:33.000 --> 56:36.000
No offense to pink, but I don't think that's right in the canon.

56:37.000 --> 56:44.000
Number one, I'm offended. Number two, if we survive the Star Wars Christmas special, we will survive Pink Darth Vader.

56:45.000 --> 56:50.000
In fact, I guarantee you Pink Darth Vader will be better than the Star Wars Christmas special and Star Wars Connect.

56:51.000 --> 56:55.000
Or did anyone tell him this is a fucking video game and you're not writing stories for Star Wars?

56:56.000 --> 57:02.000
I mean, unless they're saying that these characters that they're creating for this game are part of the canon now, which I doubt it.

57:03.000 --> 57:10.000
Um, it was just dumb. So, that was the excuse that they made, and like I said, people did some digging in the code of the game and,

57:11.000 --> 57:14.000
Oh, what the hell is this? There's some fucking cosmetic shit hidden in here.

57:15.000 --> 57:18.000
Oh, but we can't do that because that will violate canon.

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
Alright. So, anyways, so there's that. On top of that-

57:22.000 --> 57:23.000
There's your weekly point in laugh at EA.

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
Yes, exactly. So then, of course, um-

57:26.000 --> 57:27.000
Can we just give that a stupid award?

57:28.000 --> 57:29.000
Sure. I haven't done one in a while.

57:30.000 --> 57:40.000
Aside from that game and Need for Speed, another game that just recently was part of this whole EA early access thing was the EA Sports UFC 3.

57:41.000 --> 57:47.000
Which also apparently has the same pay-to-win loot box system, and it's even worse in Star Wars.

57:47.000 --> 57:54.000
Because the reason why, they have, um, cards in the game to actually affect your strikes in there.

57:55.000 --> 58:01.000
So, if you have enough, you know, if you pay enough money, your punches are actually gonna be more effective than your opponent's punches.

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
So, it's just ridiculous that they're- and they're gonna keep doing it.

58:05.000 --> 58:10.000
And one of the other things that they said too is that they're gonna, you know, still try to keep these microtransactions in the game.

58:10.000 --> 58:18.000
So, it's- obviously, this is the path that they're wanting to go on with this stuff. And apparently, it's just ruining these games.

58:21.000 --> 58:22.000
Next.

58:22.000 --> 58:23.000
Next.

58:23.000 --> 58:27.000
I'm gonna do this MTV early 2000s style.

58:28.000 --> 58:29.000
Next.

58:29.000 --> 58:35.000
Alright. So, um, as you know, the game awards are right around the corner, so that's gonna be something we'll be seeing pretty soon.

58:35.000 --> 58:42.000
Um, one thing, though, which I expect to be there, is a new trailer for Death Stranding.

58:43.000 --> 58:47.000
And I think it's also gonna be a little bit confirmed, since, uh, Guillermo del Toro is gonna be there.

58:48.000 --> 58:54.000
How about, if, I mean, trailer, okay, whatever, how about a glimpse of, like, what the game really looks like?

58:55.000 --> 59:02.000
Like, is it survival horror? Is it strategy? Is it- is it MMO? No, I know it's not MMO.

59:02.000 --> 59:03.000
I just wanna see more.

59:03.000 --> 59:04.000
Yeah, right? Yeah.

59:04.000 --> 59:05.000
I just wanna see more.

59:05.000 --> 59:06.000
Yeah.

59:06.000 --> 59:11.000
Um, so, that should be coming pretty soon. Um, I think that's later this week, so-

59:11.000 --> 59:12.000
It is. I think it's Friday.

59:12.000 --> 59:13.000
Thursday or Friday, yeah.

59:13.000 --> 59:14.000
Yeah.

59:14.000 --> 59:18.000
Um, so definitely can't wait to check that out. Um, be hyped for that.

59:18.000 --> 59:25.000
Good luck with the game awards. I know we're sometimes critical of these, you know, gaming award shows, but, like, I- I will give credit where credit's due.

59:26.000 --> 59:37.000
I think Jeff Keighley's really trying. Like, I think he's really trying more than, like, Spike TV and that stuff would let him, because you have all these, you know, people in a boardroom that think they know what gamers want.

59:37.000 --> 59:41.000
And I think Jeff Keighley has his pulse a little bit- his finger a little bit better on the pulse of that.

59:41.000 --> 59:48.000
I think there's still some weird stuff that happens at those shows, but it's, for the most part, it's better than it was, and it can only go up from here, I think.

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
So, I'm looking forward to seeing this.

59:51.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Um, since we were talking about Mario a little bit ago and Animal Crossing, uh, Pocket Camp, uh, we can't forget the last big Nintendo, well, we're gonna totally ignore the whole Fire Emblem game, but the last big Nintendo game, um, on mobile platforms, which will be Super Mario Run.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:19.000
And in 2017, Super Mario Run was the most downloaded game on Android. So, apparently they're doing something right. I honestly never played it on Android.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
My son did, though.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:28.000
But not- I wonder, was it the most downloaded game on iOS? I wonder. Probably not.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Uh, I don't think so.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Because they're not touted there, or maybe those rankings don't come out until close to the end of the year, because I think iTunes will start its whole best of 2017 about, probably two weeks before the end of the year, because they take the holiday week off.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:48.000
So, probably the week before that, you're gonna start seeing the whole best of 2017, as if there was anything good about this year.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:53.000
There was some good music, some good movies, some really good movies. So, yeah.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Alright, um, another game that's gonna be coming soon to consoles, uh, DayZ, which is actually leaving early access, um, it's gonna be coming to Xbox One next year.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:13.000
They've been talking a little bit about the development of the game and how it's gonna play out on the Xbox One. Originally, they were saying that the game was gonna hit 60 FPS on the Xbox One X.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:20.000
However, that's been retracted now, and it's gonna run at 30 FPS, which is kind of disappointing, especially if you're comparing it to PC.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Um, but at least they're gonna say that, um, yeah, I guess they have, uh, DayZ is gonna be, you know, the game and the platform, and it says that we intend on keeping DayZ alive for as long as it's viable.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:43.000
And I guess the release version one, it's gonna be, they said it's not the end of the content update, so, interesting.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:53.000
I guess, um, I haven't really heard too much about DayZ in a while. I know with PUBG out and everything, it kind of seems to be a lot of people forgetting about DayZ in there.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:56.000
So, interesting to see that that's still going.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Um, as I was talking a little bit about VR stuff earlier, um, there's actually been a pretty big year for VR, so, it looks like one million VR headsets have, um, shipped, I guess, in a single quarter for the first time.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:18.000
So, um, this is from, I guess, a market research firm called Canalysis, which broke down, um, the market by platform.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:25.000
PlayStation VR shipped the most with over 490,000 units in the third financial quarter of this year.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Of course, that includes July, August, and September.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Oculus shipped, um, 210,000 units of the Rift, and the HTC Vive sold 160,000 units.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.000
I'm assuming the Vive sold less because it was more expensive.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:45.000
But, um, good to see that the platform's still going, and there's definitely a lot of content out.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:56.000
I still think it can do even better, and especially now with some of these, um, other companies coming out with a little bit more affordable headsets, it'd be interesting to see how well those do.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Although, the new Windows one I saw, the one that they had from Microsoft didn't look that great because their price point on it was originally going to be lower than everybody else, but then the Rift dropped its price, and so now it's kind of equal with that.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Unfortunately, spec-wise, it's not equal with that, and so it's like, eh, you need to drop it further.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Yeah.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:23.000
But I'll be curious to see, um, how that turns out. I mean, I'm, I'm ready for the future where I do everything in VR.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.000
I'm ready.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.000
You ready for it? I'm ready.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000
I'm ready to play Desert Bus in VR.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:31.000
I'm also, I'm also ready, yes. Well, I don't want to play Desert Bus in VR, but there's a thing that you can do now.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:47.000
So, yes, Desert Bus VR, you can, uh, check it out. Of course, this was, um, featured in, um, I think it was, I don't know if, yeah, they were doing that as part of the whole, uh, Desert Bus for Hope, the 11th annual one.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:59.000
So I guess they were playing, uh, Desert Bus VR, and, um, and it's out for, it's a free download on Steam for the Vive and the Rift, and of course, Desert Bus for those who may not remember.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:10.000
It is a game that came out of, um, what was it, the Penn and Teller, I don't remember the full name of the game was, but it's a Penn and Teller game, where it's basically, you have to drive from...

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
Smokey mirrors from, oh, oh, yeah.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:24.000
So you have to drive, um, this bus, basically, that keeps veering slightly to the right, and, um, for, and it's the actual time that it takes to drive between these two cities.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:34.000
So people do it just as kind of a punishment for themselves and also to raise charities, so, um, yeah, it looks like Desert Bus and VR, it's way prettier.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:49.000
The game was created as a bit of a statement, and I'll let y'all go listen to Bobby's show, he gets more into it, I'm not gonna repeat it, um, but I think it's, it's a very tongue-in-cheek sort of statement, which Penn and Teller do, like, a lot.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:53.000
You may remember they had that TV show, you know, that whole thing, that's kind of their thing.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Yeah, it's from driving, I guess it's, yeah, they'll simulate driving from Tucson to Las Vegas.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Yes.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.000
In real time, without brakes.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Yes, which, I mean, the drive from here to Las Vegas is bad enough, I can't even fucking imagine Tucson to Vegas.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Oof.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:09.000
But it's cool, though, I don't know what, if they have, like, other features in there.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Oh, the VR one?

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Yeah.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Yeah, you can be a passenger now, and you can, uh, you can sit in, as a passenger, and you can, like, throw spitwads at the driver.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.000
And that's it.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Why?

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Loki, you're asking a question about why does this game even exist in the first place. Why not?

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Also, something about, uh, the NPR interview-style interview that you can listen to on the radio.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:37.000
The drones on and on, and they talk very quietly like they do on the radio.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.000
That's awesome.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Yeah, exactly.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:46.000
All right, well, uh, I know you have a little bit more news, but I think this is a good time for us to take a trip down memory lane.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Are you ready, Dark Sakura, to unveil?

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.000
I reckon.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:53.000
It might be a short show, but we still got plenty of time to talk about classic games.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Yes.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
We always have a minute to talk about classic games.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Every week, Dark Sakura jumps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, hey, this game is worthy of your attention.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
It's the Classic Game of the Week.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Yup.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Dark Sakura, what is it?

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
R-Type Delta, I chose.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Because I've already done R-Type, but R-Type Delta, believe it or not, is kind of a hard-to-get-your-hands-on bit of a game, and it is the-

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:26.000
That is not R-Type Delta, by the way. That is the, I keep forgetting to put the video ad blocker in Chrome, which I switched to here in the studio. Sorry about that.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Oh, Rob.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Here's R-Type Delta.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Anyway, R-Type Delta is the fourth of the R-Type games, and the first one to use 3D.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:45.000
It came out for PlayStation in 1999, and it's generally considered a really, really good game in the R-Type series.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:49.000
A friend of ours just gave us a copy.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
So, hey.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:07:02.000
R-Type Delta also offers different ships that you can pilot, and every one of the ships has-

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:18.000
You can get your force, which is like your big shield slash extra gun, and you get a dose gauge, which every time it hits 100, you can use the delta attack, which is a super attack.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:25.000
So you start off with the R-9A Delta, which is based off of the original R-9 from R-Type.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:32.000
You have the RX Albatross that has wings, and it uses the tentacle force.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:45.000
R-13 Cerberus, which is a red and black one, and it has an energy ribbon that can attack, and then the POW armor, which you unlock after beating the game in medium or hard mode.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:52.000
It was generally, you know, like I said, it was well received.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:59.000
A lot of people even thought it was better than the original R-Type, although to me that's really, really hard to match.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:06.000
And it's basically considered one of these shooters you have to have if you have a PlayStation.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:15.000
For being in a PlayStation game, the polys are pretty nice, it's very complex, it looks really good.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Apart from just being super fun to play, although some people found that it was a little bit more difficult than it needed to be, but your mileage may vary.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:33.000
And as far as I am aware, there has been no other release of R-Type Delta, so good luck finding it.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:37.000
And that's it, R-Type Delta for PlayStation.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:51.000
I forgot they made this on PlayStation, but I like how it has kind of the better backgrounds in this, and just kind of like the solid black you remember from the, you know, TurboGrafx and other versions of this that existed, or other R-Types that were out there.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:57.000
I will say, you know, R-Type is still, I like the original R-Type better than this.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.000
But this is really freaking good.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:05.000
I like it better than Super R-Type, I like it better than R-Type too, so there you go.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Alright, R-Type Delta, your classic game of the week, here at Orange Lounge Radio.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:14.000
I think you just have a couple quickies left, right, Loki?

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Yeah, a few more things, so we can...

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Let me get quick, sorry, not to interrupt you, but you did it to me earlier.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:23.000
We will also start to open up the Skype line, I think is a good time to do that if you do want to give us a call and say hello tonight.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:31.000
The Skype line is open while Loki touches on these last few things here.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:35.000
Yeah, I want to clarify because I was also kind of confused about, you know, DayZ and PUBG.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:40.000
So PUBG was actually the one that they said it was going to be originally running in 60 FPS, and now it's 30 across all platforms.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:43.000
That's kind of disappointing because PUBG is more popular.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:48.000
I have no idea what frame rate it runs on for DayZ, but at least it's coming to consoles, so that's kind of cool.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Alright, so other things we can talk about.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:58.000
So there's this cool new skin that's going to be coming out for the PlayStation 4 called the PlayStation 4 Legacy Theme.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:05.000
It's based off of the PlayStation 2 dashboard, and you can check it out for $2.99, and it looks pretty awesome.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:12.000
So they have that developed by, I guess, Truett Pixel who does some of these animated backgrounds.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:18.000
And they really did capture quite a bit of the PlayStation 2 dashboard feel, so check that out.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Also, on PlayStation Plus, you're going to be getting some games for December.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:28.000
And with those, Darksiders 2, the definitive edition.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Kung Fu Panda Showdown of Legendary Legends on PlayStation 4.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:37.000
And then PlayStation 3, Siberia Collection and X-Play's Lost Memories.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:44.000
And then for the Vita, Forma.8, which is a cross-buy with PlayStation 4 and Wanted Corp.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:55.000
And finally, we have Fireaxis announcing an expansion for Civ 6, which is Rise and Fall.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:03.000
And, yeah, it looks interesting. Launching February 8th, it's going to, I guess, focus on the great ages.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:10.000
And introduce, I guess, a concept where your empire can go through a dark period.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:13.000
And they have a new city-based loyalty system.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:17.000
Oh, kind of like 2017 when your civilization goes through a dark period.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:18.000
Sadly, yes.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:19.000
Yeah, okay, I get that.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:20.000
I don't know.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:23.000
I wonder if that was planned that way.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:27.000
That's a pretty clever move. I bet these things are planned years in advance.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:31.000
I think they have a different idea of what a dark age is.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.000
I know, but I can't. Jamie, am I right? You can't help but notice that.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Isn't it ironic that a game about a dark period for a civilization comes out right after 2017?

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
A little too ironic.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.000
Don't you think?

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:46.000
And then last but not least, I wanted to mention that there's this awesome mod out there.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:53.000
So, if you're a fan of those battle royale games, well, there's a game that you may have played a while back called

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is now getting modded to have a battle royale type gameplay in it.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:05.000
So, GTA San Andreas PUBG is, I guess it's a new mod.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:11.000
This one allows you to actually kind of play the whole battle royale thing in Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:19.000
So, they're seeing right now, at the moment, they are working on, there are about 200 to 400 players on various mod servers.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:27.000
And then they're seeing that they have, I guess, quite a bit of people interested in these types of mods.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:30.000
So, it looked kind of cool, but San Andreas is certainly looking dated.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:34.000
I would like something like this in maybe Grand Theft Auto 5.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Well, they have something like that in Grand Theft Auto 5 online, but yeah.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:41.000
It's neat. I like mods in Grand Theft Auto, so why not?

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Why not? I just saw a call come in that went away.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:49.000
OrangeLaunchRadio, all one word on Skype if you want to get in here.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Oh, there it is. Let's take this call.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLaunchRadio. Who's this?

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Hi, this is Raginator.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Hey, Raginator. Don't forget to turn the...

01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Hi, this is Raginator.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:03.000
Sorry, my computer was freezing out for a second.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:06.000
That's all right. You should know this by now. No, that's fine. What's up?

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Yeah, I just have a quick question that I'd like to post to everyone.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Then I'll free up the line just in case anyone else wants to call.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:16.000
Yeah, sure.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:25.000
All right. Well, not so much on this show too much, but as everyone remembers,

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:33.000
you used to host Hoard House for a while before that show went on permanent hiatus,

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:39.000
and towards the end of the run, you focus on all games that happen to be online.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.000
Yep.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Now, I would like to pose a question on this show since Hoard House is no longer around.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Is there any online series of games, either completely online,

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:08.000
or the focus of the community has been more generally online?

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Let's say, for example, Call of Duty, where Call of Duty does have both single-player and multiplayer,

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
but everyone likes to play online.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Sure.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:35.000
Now, is there any series that the three of you really, really enjoyed playing online that has essentially died out,

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:46.000
and there has been no entries into the series for a number of years that you want to see a revival in?

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:53.000
Well, I'm going to take the easy answer that I think Loki would say. Probably Final Fantasy XI.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:56.000
I mean, there still is a community in XI. I think many of it moved.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:00.000
Much of it moved to Final Fantasy XIV, even though they are different types of games,

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:05.000
but I know XI is looking to reinvent itself in a mobile type of way, which is interesting to me.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:08.000
I have concerns about that, but that was supposed to happen.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.000
They announced that a couple years ago. We haven't really seen anything.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:15.000
Granted, it takes time to develop that stuff, so whatever, but I'm very curious to see what happens there.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:18.000
Left Square Enix announced something that takes multiple years to develop.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:21.000
Yeah, so that's why I'm kind of like, all right, I shouldn't really be surprised about this,

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:24.000
but yeah, you know, because that was a game that I did spend.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:27.000
You know, Loki, especially, a lot of you may forget,

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:30.000
because I know not all of you have been listening to Orange Lawns Radio for 15 years,

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:34.000
but we've been doing this show for 15 years, and the first year was in a house,

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:39.000
but then Loki and I became roommates for years two through maybe five or so,

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:42.000
I don't remember, two through four, two through five, of this show,

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:47.000
and we spent a lot of those nights, when we weren't doing OLR, playing Final Fantasy XI.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:50.000
Loki was in one chair playing him, and I'm playing, you know, and so, you know,

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:54.000
and I made some great online friends through that whole experience.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.000
You know, I'm probably friends with Shane, who you hear a lot on this show,

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:01.000
because of Final Fantasy XI. We played that a lot, and you know, other people do,

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:07.000
so I know that wasn't a craze that Jamie got in on as bad.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:10.000
I think she, like, tried it for a little bit, but, right, you played,

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:13.000
I remember you played XI, but you got really annoyed at all the,

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.000
Heal, please. Heal, please.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Well, it's just because I would throw my macro for people to come for healing.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:22.000
And then they never do it.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:23.000
Because they're stupid bitches.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
That would involve people reading and listening to direction.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:26.000
Let them die.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:31.000
I believe it was Marie Antoinette who said, let them eat cake,

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:34.000
and I believe it was Jamie Summers who said, let them die.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:41.000
Alright, anyway, so yeah, I guess my easy answer is Final Fantasy XI.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:42.000
Do you have an answer for that, Loki?

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:44.000
I miss-

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
Grand Theft Auto IV, because you were good at it.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:50.000
I do miss Grand Theft Auto IV only, because I like the style of how they set up,

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:51.000
like, the death matches and that.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:55.000
Grand Theft Auto V, it is a more open game, and I think there's a lot of,

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:58.000
you know, advantages to that, because you can do a lot of different gameplay,

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:02.000
but I do miss, like, the arena style death matches, where it's just,

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:05.000
it's a set map, the weapons are in a set position,

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:10.000
it's just getting good at that map instead of just it being everywhere,

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
and fucking crazy, so I don't know.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:14.000
Jamie, do you have an answer for this?

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:18.000
I thought of a second answer, and I bet you would totally cosign this.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.000
Go ahead.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Fantasy Star Online.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:22.000
Yes.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:23.000
That, I miss that a lot.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:24.000
Me too.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:25.000
I know a lot of people miss that.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:29.000
And Blue Burst was on PC, and, you know, it literally died, you know,

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:33.000
because they pulled the plug on it, but the game does live on, I guess,

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.000
maybe private servers, but I haven't looked into how to join one of those in a long time.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:39.000
Can you really play Fantasy Star Online anymore, in any form?

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.000
In any form?

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:41.000
On Fantasy Star Online 2.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:43.000
Which isn't even here, so.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:44.000
But it's fully translated.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:45.000
Yeah, I guess that's true.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
And they don't care if you play on the Japanese servers.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.000
Oh, really?

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:50.000
Yeah.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Oh, I thought they had issues with that at first.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
No, I've had an account for an age I just haven't played in a while.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.000
I need to just fucking play that already.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:18:02.000
But I need to re-up my Final Fantasy, not Final Fantasy, but my WoW.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:03.000
World of Warcraft?

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:04.000
Yeah.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Yeah.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
You have to do that raid with me, because it's fun.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:08.000
What raid? The new one?

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.000
No, no, no, no.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:12.000
The one that was, um...

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Crap, what was the name of the character Jennifer Hale voiced in it?

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:19.000
The queen elf lady, night elf lady, or whatever.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Uh...

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:21.000
Uh...

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:22.000
God damn it.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:23.000
Yeah, but it was...

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:26.000
She's a character and hears the storm, too, and I can't think of it.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:27.000
Yeah, it starts with an E.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.000
Okay.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:29.000
But that...

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:30.000
A loon?

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:31.000
No.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:32.000
But the Gul'dan fight, and that's pretty fun.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:33.000
Okay.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Anyway.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:35.000
Alright, yeah.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:39.000
I haven't done Endgame and WoW in years, so it'll be interesting.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:40.000
Alright.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:43.000
Well, Rageinator, I'm gonna turn the tables on ya.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
Is there an online game that you miss?

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Oh, yeah, definitely.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:48.000
Um...

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:56.000
At least during the PlayStation 2 era, and to a certain extent, the PlayStation 3 era,

01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:01.000
I used to love the Jesus out of the Soulcom series.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Uh, I...

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:09.000
You know, the Soulcom games and, of course, Final Fantasy XI, I used to play like no other,

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
but I really, really enjoy it.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:16.000
If I had to pick between those two games, you know, I would...

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:17.000
You know...

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:18.000
You know...

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:25.000
You know, well, Soulcom's a series, whereas XI's just a single entry, but, you know,

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:30.000
I would probably pick the Soulcom over anything.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:39.000
You know, unfortunately, Sony kind of threw up the proverbial white flag with the Soulcom series.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:47.000
You know, because unfortunately, you know, well, you know, Soulcom 4 was the final game of the series,

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:56.000
and unfortunately, it was poorly timed, because, you know, that was launched right when the PSN outage happened.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:06.000
So they lost a lot of sales because of that, and not only that, but Soulcom 4 tried to emulate the Call of Duty games,

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
which were hugely...

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:19.000
Well, still are, but hugely popular, and because of that, you know, the game kind of lost its uniqueness,

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:33.000
where previous entries had, you know, but if they stuck to, you know, their roots with the Soulcom series,

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:41.000
you know, pure Soulcom, you know, have plenty of maps, you know, new ones, classic ones,

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:51.000
and released it on console, obviously, because Sony makes consoles, and maybe even put, like, a PC port on Steam or whatever.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:21:03.000
I would definitely, you know, buy it, and if need be, if it doesn't come with a PC, then I would seriously consider getting a console and just play Soulcom again.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:11.000
You know, unfortunately, the older Soulcom games are no longer online anymore, they took down servers, so...

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:14.000
They always do that, yep. That's exactly what's behind your question.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:20.000
Hey, Jamie, by the way, I just got a text from Alan, while Rachael was talking there. Tyranda?

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:23.000
No, it was, um...

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:24.000
Azshara?

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:32.000
No, it's none of them. She was introduced in that comic about the... fuck, what kind of elves were they?

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:33.000
It's fine.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:34.000
I'll look it up, hold on.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:40.000
Alright, you know what, we need, you need to get, we need to, if there wasn't an 8 hour time difference, we need to get Raven and EJ on the line stat,

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:44.000
because they would know this answer like that. Our pals from Girls Gone Wild.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:47.000
Alright, anyway, Rachael, I'm gonna let you go so we can get some more calls, but that was a good question.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:48.000
Elison.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
Thanks, there it is, Elison. Alright.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
Alright, have a nice night. Take care.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:53.000
You too, bye.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:58.000
Alright, OrangeLountRadio, all one word if you want to get on the show tonight, some other answers from chat.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:03.000
AkumaJP says, I miss goofing around in home. That's a good answer.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:08.000
Uh, let's see, SSG100Matt says, I thought Jamie was gonna say MapleStory, but I guess you can still play it.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:12.000
Why don't, would Neopets be a valid answer to the question?

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLountRadio, who's this?

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
Hey, hey, it's Rama.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:19.000
Hey, Rama, I swear to God, if you have a link, I ain't clickin' it.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:23.000
I actually called to apologize about that, I didn't even know he was gonna react that way.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:26.000
It was disgusting!

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:31.000
I just have it over on Twitter, and it was right there, I was just like, oh that's what he meant.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
You know I'm just giving you shit, what's on your mind tonight?

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:36.000
I know you are, I know you are.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
You know me, what's on your mind tonight?

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:42.000
A couple of things, number one, I finally got myself an Xbox One.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:49.000
Oh, congrats, did you do the Xbox One X, or did you kind of take the opportunity to get a cheap Xbox One S?

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:55.000
I got the Xbox One S because, as powerful as X is, to me it'd be a waste of money,

01:22:55.000 --> 01:23:01.000
because I wouldn't play the console enough to appreciate what it can do, plus my TV's about ten years old.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:07.000
Yeah, exactly, if you don't have the top of the line TV to go to the top of the line Xbox, not quite gonna be a match.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:13.000
Somethin' like that, and I don't play games as much as I used to.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:20.000
My Xbox One, I'm gonna be playing three or four games on it, and streaming a lot of anime and Netflix and Hulu.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:26.000
Speaking of anime, I'm glad you reminded me, because I did this whole Ingress thing this weekend, I totally forgot to mention,

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:31.000
the other thing they announced, is that there is going to be an Ingress anime.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:35.000
Yeah, they showed a four second clip of an Ingress anime.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:36.000
Four second.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Four second, but again, the game is very big in Japan, so I'm not, you know, they have the vending machines and shit over there,

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:46.000
so I'm not completely surprised to hear that, but I think that's really cool.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:51.000
That does sound like a great thing, but I just, I wonder now who's gonna pick up the rice to it,

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:58.000
and I have a feeling it might be Viz, because Viz is right there in San Francisco, so.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Very true, and it will fill the void left by the Tron anime that only lasted one season on Disney XD, so.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.000
Yeah.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:17.000
Bobby Blackwolf says, maybe they should make an anime based on Pokemon Go. I see what you did there.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
I won't play, son, I won't play.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:28.000
Well, maybe they kinda did, because with all this renewed interest in Pokemon, thanks in part to Pokemon Go,

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:34.000
they kinda went back and they kinda redid the origin story of Pokemon. I don't know what the fuck else to call it.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:39.000
What else do you call Pikachu, I choose you? That's basically like a retelling of the origin story, right?

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:46.000
Yeah, but you also gotta remember, the movies aren't canon to the TV series, so the movies can run in its own little universe.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:47.000
That's a good point.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:54.000
And let's not forget, when Pikachu spoke for the very first time, everybody lost their proverbial shit.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:58.000
What the fuck, are you printing your own anime over there? What was that?

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:01.000
I'm printing the script to my porn, Rob.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:08.000
If you're going to cop an ad, I'm gonna cut out your cameo appearance.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:11.000
I'm sorry, sir.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:13.000
Alright.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:20.000
Yeah, I know, SD100matt in chat says, dot matrix printer. I know, it sounds like he's running the fucking print shop, printing a banner over there.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
Okay, strong bad.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:38.000
But, I mean, it's an Epson inkjet printer, and I'm just like, you know what, I'm tired of buying Christmas labels and stuff for one and two bucks and losing them, so I'm gonna go out, I'm gonna buy some labels, buy some ink, make fancy labels, and print them myself.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:48.000
There you go, fancy. I wanna find, can I, can you find a copy of, like, the print shop, like, so you can actually make labels that look like they were made in the print shop? Can you do that?

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
Yes, is there a Staples near you?

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
Oh, I'm sure there is, like 5,000 of them.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:26:00.000
Go to Staples, go to the 999 rack, you will find print shop, a version from a year prior for, like, ten bucks.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:08.000
Okay, I'm gonna find that, cause I wanna see, well, I mean, I don't want a new, but I don't want it to look new, I want it to look like I printed it in 1986.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:11.000
And if you wanna be fancy, there's always Print Master Gold, so.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:31.000
Oh, fancy. Uh, let's see, also, uh, s2100matt in chat is kinda reminding me that maybe I should forgive you for the link thing, because you did send me Stroopwafel, and I think, Matt, you should hire Matt as your lawyer, because I, I think I will have to forgive you, because you did send Stroopwafel, so you are forgiven this time.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
Oh, thank you, good sir, thank you, thank you.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:36.000
Alright, my friend, I'm gonna let you go, but thanks for calling.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:37.000
No problem, dude.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:38.000
Alright, bye.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:41.000
No, they still sell dot matrix printers that are actually USB.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:42.000
Really?

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:45.000
You can get one, they have one, I was looking at eBay here, uh.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
There's part of me that's like, why would I ever do that?

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:53.000
An Okie Microline 490 dot matrix 24 pin USB printer.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:56.000
Did they change the enlightenment logo?

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:59.000
Like this eyeball thing.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:02.000
The green, little, kinda like.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:03.000
With the eyeball.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:06.000
The, you're talking about the swirly with the triangle in the middle?

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
I'm talking about the triangle one, I'm talking about this one with an eyeball.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:09.000
Can you show me?

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
Yeah, give me a second, I'll link it to you.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
Ok, alright, I thought you were just gonna flip your thing around.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:16.000
Alright, um, I have a few stories here.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:19.000
I can probably squeeze in one more call at Orange Lounge Radio.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
Yes, that has always been the enlightened logo.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
That's not the glyph, but that's the logo for the team.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:24.000
Ok.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:25.000
Yeah.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:26.000
I just always knew about the triangle.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:33.000
Right, because in the game, the glyph for enlightenment is, you draw like a half circle and there's a triangle.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
But to be fair, Resistance also has this problem.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:38.000
I call the Resistance glyph a four, because it kinda looks like the number four.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
Oh yeah, that's how I always remember it.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:43.000
And then, but the actual, their logo looks like a key.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:44.000
Looks like a blue key.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:45.000
Yeah.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:46.000
Yeah.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:47.000
So, anyway.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:50.000
There you go, another Ingress fucking derailment on this program.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:51.000
We should start counting how many of those there are.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:52.000
Alright.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:55.000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:59.000
If you can squeeze in here while I redo these last couple stories here.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:02.000
I had a couple of the quick things I wanted to point out here.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:09.000
Apparently some graphic novels on the way for games like Wolfenstein, Tekken, and The Evil Within.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:15.000
I hope they're as awesome as the FX9 novels from the 80s about Blaster Master and Simon's Quest.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:18.000
Oh wait, but these are graphic novels, so I guess they'll be a little different.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
They'll be nothing but pictures.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:26.000
So, Wolfenstein Volume 1 is a prequel to Wolfenstein 2, The New Colossus, which I kinda laugh at that because I go,

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:32.000
well, wouldn't Wolfenstein 1 be the prequels, but I guess it doesn't work like that.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:39.000
Tekken Blood Feud is coming out for the Tekken franchise, and The Evil Within, The Interlude.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:45.000
So, you can check that out if you're a fan of The Evil Within, which you may have forgot that the sequel was released last month.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:48.000
Or, no, we're in December now, two months ago.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:53.000
There is a Life is Strange bonus episode coming for Before the Storm,

01:28:53.000 --> 01:29:00.000
and what's notable about this is that Ashley Burch will be returning to the role as Chloe Price's voice actress,

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:05.000
because the strike, she didn't reprise the role in Before the Storm,

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:10.000
but she will be doing this for a bonus episode, which I think is, that's pretty cool.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:15.000
Square Enix kinda said, you know, Rihanna DeVri, I hope I said that right,

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:18.000
who was the replacement voice actress in the time being,

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:22.000
she did a fantastic job in the motion capture, we're thankful to her, blah blah blah,

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:25.000
but we're gonna do Chloe.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:30.000
Oh, I guess Rihanna will still do the voice, excuse me, the motion capture,

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:35.000
but the voice will go back to the original actress, so that's kinda neat.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:36.000
So you can check that out.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:45.000
And lastly, did you know that a certain video game turned 45 years old this past week?

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
It was Pong.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:51.000
That's right, Pong Day was celebrated this past week.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:57.000
45 years ago, Pong came into the world, and Atari decided to declare the day Pong Day.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:00.000
I don't know what authority Atari has to declare anything right now,

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:07.000
but sure, we'll roll with that, because obviously Pong was so important for where video games are at today.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:11.000
But I just wanted to remind you that Pong is now 45 years old,

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:16.000
and you know what that means, you are also old.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:17.000
And on that note-

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:18.000
But I'm not older than Pong.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:24.000
That's right, but some of our listeners out there might be older than Pong, and that's okay if you are.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
We love all our listeners. So there you go.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:32.000
Alright, that's gonna wrap it up for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio,

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:33.000
because no other calls are coming in on Skype.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:36.000
I mentioned at the top of the show it's gonna be a shorter show tonight.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:37.000
We'll be back in seven days, though.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
I was gonna mention what's coming out this week.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:40.000
Oh, dude, we never got to release dates, did we?

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:41.000
No, we didn't.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
I just figured there wasn't a lot. Sure, go ahead.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:44.000
So there is actually quite a bit coming out.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:51.000
So we've got seven The Days Long Gone on PC, Xenoblade Chronicles 2.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:54.000
Actually, I'm sorry, that was Friday last week, my mistake.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:31:00.000
Okay, so this week we have Dead Rising 4, Frank's Big Package on PlayStation 4.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:03.000
We have Caveman Warriors on the Switch,

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:07.000
Nine Parchments on PC, Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:10.000
A Hat in Time on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:13.000
Earth Defense Force 5 on PlayStation 4,

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:18.000
Kamen Rider Symax Fighters on PlayStation 4,

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:21.000
Spell Force 3 on PC,

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:26.000
Yakuza Kiwami 2 on PlayStation 4,

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:32.000
and finally Hello Neighbor on PC, Mac and Xbox One,

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:37.000
and Tokyo Xanadu EX Plus on PlayStation 4.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:42.000
And I guess technically, although this would be like a Saturday release or something,

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:46.000
LocoRoco 2 remaster on PlayStation 4, that's it.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
In the UK on December...

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:52.000
Oh, sorry, because of PSX is this coming weekend, that's why you have a Saturday release.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
Oh, sorry, just want to throw that out there.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:57.000
In the UK on December 5th, we have Dead Rising 4, Frank's Big Package,

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:00.000
and on the 6th, Vostok, Inc. for Switch.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:04.000
All right, and I don't have the Japanese dates up, sorry,

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
I was not prepared for the assignment, so...

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
You are not prepared.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:13.000
That's right, so good stuff coming out in Japan this week, good stuff.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:17.000
All right, that is going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:20.000
I want to thank you guys for listening, we'll be back in seven days

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:23.000
for something a little closer to two and a half, maybe three hours.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:27.000
As we get into the holiday period, we still have to figure out what we're going to do for OLR

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:31.000
celebrating the holidays, because I don't think we're going to do a show on New Year's Eve.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:34.000
Christmas Eve, not likely either, so we'll figure something out,

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
maybe we'll tape something in advance.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:39.000
But only a few more weeks until the end of the year, if you can believe it.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:42.000
And we get to open the time capsule. Aren't you guys excited?

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:43.000
Oh my god.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:46.000
Did we put more shit in there?

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:49.000
No, it's really old stuff from June.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:50.000
From June.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:57.000
So we have to, though, with the new year, we'll have to put stuff right from the start of the year.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:01.000
Oh yeah, no. The OLR time capsule will return in 2018, for sure.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:04.000
Yes, in the Darth Vader piggy bank.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:07.000
Which I will be painting pink.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:12.000
No, because pink is really an unfortunate color, even though that's my hair color.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
I don't give a shit.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:15.000
Oh, you know what's funny?

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:16.000
What?

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
I hate the color pink, but what color is my hair?

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:19.000
Pink.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:20.000
Right.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
Ergo, she hates her hair.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:30.000
No, I think it looks good on my head, but I hate it as clothing colors.

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:32.000
Okay.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:36.000
What's it say about me? I like pink as a clothing color.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:39.000
I'm also trying to go for, like, more of a dusty rose color.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
Also, I fucking love my shirt today.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:42.000
Yeah, Murder She-Ra.

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:43.000
Yeah, it's-

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:44.000
Angelo Lansbury.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:48.000
It's a shirt that says Murder She-Ra with Angela Lansbury posed as She-Ra.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:54.000
Or if you are a listener of the RuPaul podcast, that would be Murder She-Dunge sat down in She-Ra.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
So there it is.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:59.000
Anyway, where were we? Oh yes, getting out of here.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:02.000
What happened to baby JJ?

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:08.000
What happened was we were about to end the show, and then a commercial for Squatty Potty started.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:09.000
All right.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:12.000
What?

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
That's it. Y'all are getting Squatty Potties.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:15.000
No.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:16.000
I have one.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:19.000
No, they have to pay for advertising. I swear I'm gonna go back and bleep that.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:22.000
They want to get on this podcast, they have to pay for it like they do everywhere else.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:25.000
I have one, but it's not a real Squatty Potty.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:26.000
Uh-oh.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:27.000
It's a naughty Squatty Potty.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:28.000
That's a naughty Squatty Potty.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
That's what we need to advertise as the competitor.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:31.000
Yep.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:32.000
All right, anyway.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
Sit down and shit.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:39.000
No, no, no. Instead of the Squatty Potty, it's the City Shitty.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:46.000
We want to thank you guys for listening to Orange Lounge Radio tonight,

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:49.000
and if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio...

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:51.000
Okay.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:53.000
Great.

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:54.000
Great.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:55.000
That's great.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:56.000
Good job.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
Once you pop, that's great.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
Good job, the cheat. Have a trophy.

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:02.000
Good job.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
So if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio,

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
tell a friend of five about the show,

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:11.000
and help us spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:14.000
but if the voices aren't here, then that's less great.

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
So get more people here.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:20.000
Advertise for us is basically what we're asking, because we don't ask for money.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:24.000
But we do ask for your five-star reviews on places like iTunes, Google Play,

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
wherever it is that you found this particular podcast,

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:30.000
because we're pretty much anywhere you can find podcasts except Stitcher,

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:33.000
and if you want to know why, you'll have to go back in the archives.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
That's going to do it for another episode of the show.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:39.000
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:42.000
Dark Sakura, do I need the FU music for your final thought?

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:43.000
Not really.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:44.000
Okay.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:47.000
To stupid little man babies on Twitter, guess what?

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:50.000
You're wrong, and I'm right, and you're blocked.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
All I can think of is that GIF of Alyssa Edwards going,

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
you're about to get blocked.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
Did you make a big tongue pop when you hit the block button?

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
I did, and you know what's funny?

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:05.000
Is that he follows like three people, and you're one of them.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
Apparently, you're following him.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
Yeah, I follow like 1,300 people on Twitter.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:10.000
Wherever.

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:13.000
If I figure you're not a robot, I probably follow you back.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
I'm a little more choosy.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:19.000
But there are lots of really awesome people out there,

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
and all of you people, you're not garbage.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:24.000
So, well done not being garbage.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:25.000
A plus.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:28.000
Number two, to my little sister.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:29.000
Uh-oh.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:34.000
Don't fucking tell a podcaster not to come for you.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
That's all.

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:39.000
Are you going to come for her and cut her wigs up at night?

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:42.000
All right, we'll just end there.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:43.000
You know what?

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:44.000
No, no, no, here's what I'm going to say.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:47.000
I don't have to come to her because she's already fucked up her own life.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:48.000
Ooh!

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
Do not allow dark soccer to drag you ever.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
All right, my final thought.

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:55.000
I'll go next.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:58.000
My final thought is I've probably walked 50,000 steps this weekend,

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:01.000
but I had a really good time meeting people

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
and seeing people I don't get to see often enough.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
And yeah, we'll have to do this again.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:08.000
Niantic, hurry up and announce anomaly schedule for next year

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
and try to make this sit.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:14.000
Please put something on the West Coast for quarter one.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
Because I already have a busy.

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
Or if you're going to put it in Atlanta or something,

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:22.000
try to plan it the week I'm already planning on going.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
That's all I ask.

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
Loki, your final thought.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:32.000
My final thought is that I really need to finish my Lego mock that I was working on.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
Stupid triangular tables.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:37.000
Like the building I was designing or based on,

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
they have tables inside of it.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:42.000
They're shaped like, I guess, like a triangle.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
And Legos don't do triangles very well.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:45.000
No, they don't.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:46.000
And it's been bothering the hell out of me.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:50.000
So I finally compromised to making them not triangles,

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:53.000
but it's still taking me forever.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
I've been stuck on this stupid thing.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
All right, that's going to do it for tonight.

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
Thank you guys so much for listening to our show tonight,

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:02.000
and we'll see you in seven days, as will Mr. Smush.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:06.000
Won't you, Mr. Smush, if Mr. Smush can get away from grooming himself?

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:07.000
Have a good night, everybody.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:11.000
