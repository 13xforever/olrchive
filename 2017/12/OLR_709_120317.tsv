0	27000	This week Milwaukee no longer requires augmented reality game companies to obtain a physical permit for a virtual location. So go enjoy the outdoors if it's reasonable. That's just one piece of closure in tonight's gaming news. Stay tuned for the rest of the week's headlines starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
31000	54000	Hello my friends and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight on December the 3rd of 2017 with episode number 709 of our show. We're here over the next few hours to talk about video games. Myself, Rob Roberts, you might know me on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E. And over there, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
54000	55000	Hi.
55000	56000	Hi, how are you?
56000	57000	Spiteful.
57000	58000	Spiteful?
58000	59000	Yeah.
59000	60000	Good to hear about that.
60000	61000	What's new?
61000	62000	Somebody made the mistake of pissing you off.
62000	64000	Yeah, someone I'm related to, so I got dirt.
64000	67000	Those are usually the ones to piss us off first, just saying.
67000	68000	Oh, I got dirt.
68000	71000	I know, I know. We'll get into that later.
71000	72000	Yeah.
72000	84000	So I have to mention here on OLR, I know I briefly mentioned it on Bobby's show because we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, right after our pal Bobby Blackwolf and his program.
85000	97000	And we were talking about on the call, because he's good to donate 5, 10 minutes of his show every week to us when he calls us to do this little, what did we call it way back in the beginning, the Stuart Colbert thing, the throw, the toss.
97000	98000	The handoff?
98000	99000	Yeah, the handoff, I guess.
99000	100000	It's the handjob.
100000	102000	Now, Bobby, show us a family show.
102000	103000	But we're not.
103000	104000	It's handwork.
104000	105000	All right, anyway.
105000	108000	His is the happy ending.
108000	113000	And we were talking about your hoodie that you have that is it's Cassandra from Dragon Age?
113000	116000	Yeah, it's the Cassandra armor hoodie.
116000	121000	So it's got like leatherette-ish shoulder pads and gauntlets and the big Inquisition symbol.
121000	127000	And I like it because I'm wearing leggings today because I didn't give a fuck and it covers my ass.
127000	130000	So she literally paid for cosmetics.
130000	132000	Hi, Tech Master Loki, how are you?
132000	133000	I'm fine.
133000	134000	Good.
134000	139000	No, but I mean, this thing looks like full cosplay garb when she's wearing it around the house.
139000	143000	And I'm like, when she has to go grocery shopping at seven and then defend the realm at eight.
143000	147000	Yeah, I'll find a link to it on the BioWare store and link it in the chat.
147000	148000	OK, there you go.
148000	151000	Yeah, but it also, though, is really freaking comfortable.
151000	153000	That's the fun thing about it.
153000	155000	And I'll go ahead and throw this out there.
155000	158000	I've lost twenty five pounds in the last two months.
158000	159000	Congrats.
159000	160000	Thank you.
160000	162000	It's really comfortable now.
162000	167000	It's so soft on the inside and it's just it's like wearing a blanket.
167000	169000	So almost like wearing my kigurumi.
169000	171000	But my kigurumi is way comfier.
171000	173000	So it's a Snuggie.
173000	176000	It's not it's not tight.
176000	180000	That's it's different when it actually fits and isn't a little too small.
180000	183000	I should mention we do tape live on Sunday nights.
183000	185000	I mentioned that part the six o'clock Eastern at voice network.
185000	187000	But I don't believe I mentioned our chat room.
187000	191000	If you are listening live, you can join our chat room over at live dot vog network dot com.
191000	196000	Where Dark Tetsuya says that segment is called the toss over what we're trying to think of there.
196000	198000	Yeah, but toss is offensive in Europe.
198000	203000	Vid Power says, I heard Cassandra and Armor and I immediately thought of Soul Calibur.
203000	206000	Well, that's it's not a bad thing you're doing.
206000	212000	You know, there's just there's many characters named Cassandra who are great and amazing.
212000	213000	So there you go.
213000	214000	High tech master Loki.
214000	217000	I know we said hi to you a minute ago, but your official introduction.
217000	218000	How are you doing this week?
218000	219000	I'm doing OK.
219000	222000	Yeah. What's new in your world?
222000	223000	Nothing.
223000	224000	No Lego projects.
224000	225000	No, nothing.
225000	227000	No, not really.
227000	231000	I mean, nothing I can discuss.
231000	235000	No, I really am doing like Christmas shopping.
235000	239000	So it got some of that out of the way.
239000	241000	Since you are a Lego guy, let me ask you about this,
241000	244000	because I don't remember if it came up on last week's show,
244000	247000	but I know it was all over Twitter either last week or this past week.
247000	249000	Is that apparently the Tron.
249000	251000	Yes, that was me that posted that.
251000	252000	Yes. So Tron.
252000	253000	Yeah, you posted that.
253000	255000	So yes, we got the approval pass the review process.
255000	256000	Yes, the Lego.
256000	258000	So Lego does this contest like all year round.
258000	259000	Yeah, it's all the time.
259000	264000	So it's basically this page called Lego ideas so you can submit your own designs for things.
265000	273000	And if they get 10,000 votes, then it goes to a committee that they basically decide whether they want to make it into a set or not.
273000	277000	And I've seen the one for RuPaul's Drag Race, and I don't understand why it doesn't have 10,000 votes.
277000	282000	A lot of them. Well, yeah, some of those like it's kind of weird why they don't have 10,000 votes.
282000	285000	And they do give you more time as you get more votes.
285000	291000	And a lot of the things that they don't seem to get votes for or don't approve are stuff that they have to license.
291000	292000	Right.
292000	294000	Because there's a lot of like license stuff that people want to pass through there.
294000	296000	But this winter.
296000	300000	But the Tron light cycle, yes, did make the cut.
300000	302000	So apparently it is going to be coming out at some point.
302000	306000	Now, the one that they showed online is the one that, you know, the person designed.
306000	310000	So Lego actually goes and then does the design for it based off of what they did.
310000	312000	But it's really cool those sets.
312000	313000	I've got one.
313000	321000	It's the old fishing store is one that came out not too long ago in September.
321000	323000	And that was a pretty nice set.
323000	326000	And they've got it's kind of cool inside those Lego idea sets.
326000	332000	They have like kind of a brief like bio of the person that designed it and kind of showing like his prototype and stuff.
332000	339000	And like talking about the Lego designer and what how they adapted the design to make it like Lego stuff.
339000	344000	Well, I'm glad something is kind of keeping Tron going when I get worried that Disney's forgetting about it.
344000	348000	Although, to be fair, the theme parks, you know, we know the Tron thing is going to happen in Florida.
348000	351000	So Tron is is not forgotten.
351000	356000	And of course, if you like video games and you like Disney stuff like Tron is.
356000	359000	I mean, you've got Kingdom Hearts and you've got Tron.
359000	364000	And I think, you know, people of a certain generation kind of really fondly remember Tron.
364000	365000	At least I know I do.
365000	366000	Nothing against Kingdom Hearts.
367000	369000	But seriously, explain the plot of Kingdom Hearts to me.
369000	370000	Go.
370000	371000	I haven't played enough.
371000	372000	It's only a three hour podcast.
372000	375000	You don't have enough time to explain the plot of Kingdom Hearts.
375000	378000	Disney and Capcom fucking have an ugly baby.
378000	379000	Not Capcom Square.
379000	380000	Yes.
380000	381000	Well, you know why you said Capcom?
381000	385000	Because the old NES games were all the Capcom stuff like an Oscar paid.
385000	386000	And of course, DuckTales.
386000	392000	You know, Disney and Squeenix fucking have an ugly baby with bad fashion choices.
392000	393000	Yes.
393000	396000	They have like other weird sets that have become like Lego ideas.
396000	401000	So it's like you may remember they have the Big Bang Theory set.
401000	402000	Burn it.
402000	403000	Yeah, that's terrible.
403000	412000	The one that they have coming or that it's proposed they're going to be considering it, I should say, is the set for Gilmore Girls.
415000	416000	That's funny.
416000	417000	I know people that are really into that show.
417000	418000	They're like that.
418000	422000	Oh, oh, has anyone submitted a set for The Good Place?
423000	424000	Not yet.
424000	425000	My favorite sitcom as of late.
425000	426000	No, not yet.
426000	427000	I talked about that.
427000	430000	I mean, I think I've given that show free publicity like every week.
430000	434000	I actually got that message on Facebook a couple of weeks ago from from my buddy Brad
434000	439000	from Pod Culture on the network who said you talk about it so much on OLR.
439000	440000	I finally watched it.
440000	442000	I watched all of season one.
442000	443000	It was pretty funny.
443000	448000	Yeah, I mean, I probably am a few episodes behind, but yeah, I did.
448000	450000	I did actually.
450000	454000	I've been watching all of it and it's fantastic.
454000	457000	Yeah, I watched it.
457000	458000	You know what I watch?
458000	459000	What?
459000	462000	I watch the Discovery Channel.
462000	465000	Actually, sometimes the History Channel.
465000	469000	Yeah, Batman Ninja, because that trailer came out this week.
469000	470000	That looks awesome.
470000	471000	It's a real thing.
471000	472000	He's not really look.
472000	473000	He doesn't look like a ninja.
473000	474000	He looks like samurai.
474000	476000	Yeah, but who cares?
476000	477000	Dear white people.
477000	478000	I don't care what they call it.
478000	479000	It looks awesome.
479000	483000	Dear white people, don't make it look Japanese and call it ninja.
483000	487000	Like a feudal Japan Batman versus a joker.
487000	493000	It would be more accurate to me to make him like Batman the Ronin.
493000	495000	That would be pretty badass.
495000	497000	All right, let's get into video games.
497000	499000	Believe it or not, it's a video game show.
499000	501000	We're going to run a little bit of a shorter show tonight.
501000	502000	So here's the deal.
502000	503000	I was gone all weekend.
503000	506000	Jamie has an appointment in the morning, so we can't go too late into the night.
506000	508000	So we're going to do a little bit of a shorter show.
508000	512000	And because I just got home from my trip about an hour and a half ago,
512000	514000	we don't have a script tonight.
514000	518000	The show's not scripted, but we have what we call a show roll with the itemized stories.
518000	520000	I got to totally derail the show again.
520000	521000	What a shock.
521000	524000	Just briefly, we totally need to have a Good Place episode
524000	527000	where we just censor ourselves exactly like the agent on the show,
527000	529000	because that would be hilarious.
529000	531000	Maybe April Fools, we could do that.
531000	536000	Because I'm always shocked that we actually have a wiki.
536000	541000	On the wiki, it's like orangeloungeradio.wiki.com.
541000	545000	And I don't think I've ever edited an article on there, maybe once.
545000	546000	So I'm really impressed by like...
546000	548000	I edited my own article.
548000	549000	Did you really?
549000	551000	Yeah, because people got some of the shit wrong.
551000	552000	That's right.
552000	557000	But I think most of it has been powered by listeners of the show, which I think is amazing.
557000	558000	But where was I going with this?
558000	559000	Oh, yes.
559000	560000	So one of the jokes, you can read about this on the wiki,
560000	563000	because this joke kind of expired several hundred episodes ago.
563000	565000	But we kept talking about how we were going to do a fuck show.
565000	566000	And I don't remember where this came from.
566000	570000	I don't know if it was because we were talking about how movies, like Pulp Fiction,
570000	573000	say the word fuck like 260 times.
573000	576000	I think it came from a joke like, oh, we could outdo that.
576000	580000	Because House of the Dead was one of the House of the Dead games.
580000	581000	That's it.
581000	584000	Like one of the movies that Uwe Boll did was trying to say...
584000	585000	No, it wasn't even Uwe Boll.
585000	587000	It was House of the Dead Overkill.
587000	588000	It was a game that came out.
589000	593000	And they were like, oh, yeah, we inserted the word fuck so many times into that.
593000	596000	It has a record number of fucks in there.
596000	597000	And I'm like, we could beat that.
599000	601000	Yeah, so we did.
601000	603000	But we finally delivered on that episode.
603000	604000	I don't remember the number.
604000	606000	It wasn't as funny as we had thought.
606000	607000	No, some of those things were like...
607000	609000	Then when the show happened, I think halfway through, we were like,
609000	612000	okay, we thought it would be a lot funnier, and it really wasn't.
612000	614000	No, it was on paper it was funny.
614000	616000	But a Good Place episode.
616000	617000	A Good Place episode would be funny.
617000	618000	That would be funny.
619000	620000	So there you go.
620000	622000	All right, anyway.
622000	624000	So back to games, Loki.
624000	625000	Sorry.
625000	631000	So anyway, I was out of town this weekend playing Ingress, which is a cell phone game.
631000	632000	I play it a lot.
632000	635000	I don't always talk about it here on the show because it's kind of like one of those things
635000	637000	that kind of comes and goes in waves, right?
637000	641000	So Ingress, if you don't know the game, it's by the people who did Pokemon Go,
641000	643000	but it's the game that they did before Pokemon Go.
643000	647000	So all your PokeStops and your gyms and stuff come from this game, Ingress.
647000	652000	Ingress has a small but very rabid following here in the US.
652000	656000	It's very big in Japan, which is I think part of the reason why Pokemon Go,
656000	658000	how Nintendo kind of got connected with them.
658000	662000	I think we know that story that the Pokemon company guy actually was playing Ingress,
662000	664000	and that whole thing happened.
664000	666000	And it's big around the world.
666000	668000	A lot of people are out there playing it on their cell phones
668000	670000	because it kind of gets them out and they're moving.
670000	677000	So anyway, every few months, like once a quarter or so in various cities around the world,
677000	683000	they will do these big live battles where special events happen in big cities,
683000	687000	and it's kind of a chance to get together with hundreds of other people who play the game
687000	691000	and basically play a different version of the game for four hours on a Saturday.
691000	693000	That's my nutshell description of what happened on Saturday
693000	695000	because San Francisco was one of the cities picked,
695000	699000	which is only about a two-hour drive from OLR headquarters here in Sacramento.
699000	702000	So we were able to drive over and play the game there.
702000	709000	So I bring that all up because it kind of leads to a lot of AR news that's going on.
709000	713000	So we've got hundreds of people swarming downtown San Francisco playing this game,
713000	719000	and I think what they do, I think Niantic's really good about contacting the tourism industry in these cities
719000	722000	and kind of letting them know what's happening so that way the city's kind of prepared for it,
722000	724000	although I don't, you know, in these events I've been,
724000	727000	this is only my third live event that I've attended in person.
727000	732000	I did one in Tucson last year, and I did one in Chicago.
732000	734000	And I don't remember, and then this one is San Francisco,
734000	736000	and I don't remember any of them being particularly like,
736000	740000	oh, the city did anything special type of thing, but it's just, I guess, like a heads up or whatever.
740000	745000	So anyway, I want to kick off tonight's show because not only did I have that AR thing going on,
745000	750000	which is why I'm very tired today, but we had some big news going on in AR gaming
750000	754000	that kind of changes essentially the future of AR gaming, right, Dark Sakura?
754000	757000	Yeah, but I need to, I do need to make a quick disclaimer.
757000	758000	Okay.
758000	761000	I do know that the Kill la Kill guy is behind the Ninja Batman.
761000	763000	I was quoting something from Facebook.
763000	765000	Oh, oh, is this something in chat? Somebody correct me?
765000	772000	Yeah, I was like, I know I am quoting something that someone said on Facebook because it was funny.
772000	774000	Was it though? Was it?
774000	775000	Whatever.
775000	776000	All right, moving on.
776000	781000	Yeah, and I didn't get to go because I was sick to the AR thing.
781000	782000	Sorry to hear it.
782000	784000	Yeah, it is what it is.
784000	795000	So, um, but man, why, why can't we have nice things in, um, you know, for Pokemon Go?
795000	797000	It's because people decide to be shit.
797000	804000	Um, in Milwaukee County, there was a lawsuit that went against Niantic
804000	809000	because the players went and trashed a big park, Lake Park.
809000	815000	And so, uh, the county got Niantic to remove the PokeStops and that should have set it down,
815000	822000	but then they passed an ordinance that said that, um, that companies that want to do, uh,
822000	829000	augmented reality in these places have to have a permit with like some kind of insurance.
829000	833000	It's sorry, a significant of insurance in the amount of $1 million.
833000	838000	So basically like you're doing a food truck festival anytime you want to play Pokemon Go in the park.
838000	839000	Kinda.
839000	840000	Something like that.
840000	845000	Yeah, and really it's just, it's just really terrible.
845000	851000	I mean, but basically the, um, a US district judge, um, put an injunction against the county in July
851000	856000	because the ordinance was, uh, I'm actually going to quote on this,
856000	861000	because of the strangeness and lack of sophistication of the rules, um,
861000	865000	and that those rules infringed on first amendment rights.
865000	868000	And so the federal court said, yeah, that's totally the case.
868000	874000	And so, uh, they wanted to move forward, uh, with the trial to, because they, you know,
874000	879000	the county, the Milwaukee County supervisor wanted to move forward with the trial and there wasn't a trial.
879000	888000	So basically, um, they came to an agreement, um, that the injunction against the ordinance is permanent
888000	892000	and that the municipality has to play, uh, pay Niantic's legal fees.
892000	899000	So, um, but I mean, the good thing is that at least that's not coming out of the taxpayers.
899000	900000	It's coming out of insurance.
900000	902000	So just one quick thing too.
902000	910000	I do not believe Niantic was the one that filed the lawsuit, even though they're the game that keeps getting brought up.
910000	916000	Some other, and to be fair, I follow like lots of AR games and this is one I have not played.
916000	920000	I subjected myself to poke to Garfield Go, which was garbage.
920000	922000	It was a group called Candy Labs.
922000	923000	Okay. That's it. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
923000	928000	Yeah. But at any rate though, they ended up having to pay the legal fees and everything.
928000	934000	So, well, I mean, you know, there's a part of me that wants to go good, even though I don't feel good about the,
934000	939000	you know, people in this city for what their city council did, but at least the money's coming out of insurance.
939000	946000	So whatever. But thank God this precedent was not allowed to be set because that would have really ruined AR gaming everywhere.
946000	955000	You know, everything from Pokemon Go to Ingress to, you know, even, and I don't even, where would geocaching fit in with that?
955000	957000	Because like, I know there's Munzee.
957000	964000	I don't think a lot of people have probably heard of that, but Munzee is another app that's kind of like, it's like geocaching mixed with gaming, basically.
964000	970000	It's kind of like the bridge thing where it's basically like find these barcodes that are on stickers in your favorite places type of thing.
970000	975000	So I worry that an ordinance like that, like where does geocaching fit in with that?
975000	979000	Because geocaching is like a hobby for a lot of people, like there aren't even normally apps involved.
979000	983000	You know, there can be. It makes the whole process a lot easier. There doesn't have to be.
983000	995000	So I don't know. I just, this is a precedent I'm very glad was not allowed to be set because it just, you know, if you can play chess in the park, if you can play Frisbee in the park,
995000	1002000	why can't you take out your phone and point your camera in a certain direction at the park? Doesn't make sense.
1002000	1018000	Yeah. No, this is, and the other thing too, just on a side note that I was glad that the language of the, the ordinance was called into question because we've seen it with a lot of other laws that go in tax scam,
1018000	1024000	where they sneak language into it. That's very ambiguous. That could be, Oh, hi smush.
1024000	1028000	That could be, I put him out my hand and he smushed his head into it.
1028000	1036000	That was just a total, that was a moment straight out of the room. I know I did not hit her. I did not. Oh, hi smush.
1036000	1047000	But, um, but I mean, the whole thing is that hopefully we get more cases that attack the language of something that, that bring into question.
1048000	1057000	Ambiguity. Is that the word ambiguity in the language of, of laws so that we have a lot more ambiguity. Thank you.
1057000	1066000	That we, um, that we have more scrutiny as to what sneaks its way into it. So, yeah, that I, you know, I think this is for gamers.
1066000	1073000	This is definitely a win all around for city councils. This is a whole, you know, you really need to think about some of these things you're trying to make.
1074000	1082000	Or, you know, if you're pissed that the citizens littered in the park, blame it on the citizens in the park and you know, this has to do with all these other stories.
1082000	1088000	And I hope I'm not stepping on anything someone else wanted to talk about tonight, but because it is a shorter show, we don't have a show roll.
1088000	1098000	Um, but there's this whole other story going around about how somebody is doing a, uh, a, um, study about is Pokemon go killing people and that's the clickbait headline.
1098000	1107000	But what the article is really about is, is basically boils down to distracted driving. Like are people getting in more accidents where there are pokey stops and gyms because of this stuff?
1107000	1115000	And it's, and here's the thing, and you know, we talked a little bit about this. Anybody that plays Pokemon go is going to die. So it has a hundred percent mortality rate.
1115000	1127000	I, I would just like to point out that there are tools that are now built into most modern phones, like the do not disturb while driving, which I encourage everyone to activate.
1127000	1137000	Because any type of distracted driving can potentially lead to an accident, even if it's just looking at your phone for half a second to get a direction.
1137000	1143000	And it doesn't even have to be your phone. Like we all, we've all heard the story about so-and-so is doing their makeup while driving.
1143000	1144000	Or eating.
1144000	1155000	Eating is a big one. Or, um, now that everything, that these control panels are super fancy and you know, you can sometimes get distracted by pushing all the buttons on your control panel to do the radio or, you know, Spotify or whatever built into your car.
1155000	1165000	You know, there's millions of ways to get distracted while driving your car. So it's just like, you know, again, if you're going to choose to play Pokemon go while you drive and you get into an accident, is that Pokemon go's fault?
1165000	1167000	No, it's your fault for being a moron.
1167000	1168000	Exactly.
1168000	1169000	Yeah.
1169000	1173000	I'm sorry. Did I say that rudely? I mean, your, your fault for being a fucking moron.
1173000	1176000	Much better.
1176000	1180000	I've got a fire today. I have a fire in my soul.
1180000	1181000	It needs more cowbell.
1181000	1184000	Well, I can't have caffeine, so I'm going to have to fuel it somehow.
1184000	1196000	All right. Anyway, uh, so there you go at the top of the show talking about the, uh, big, uh, Pokemon go ordinance and, uh, the future of AR gaming looks good, which leads me into this whole Ingress event. Right?
1196000	1209000	So we're doing Ingress and you know, uh, it was fun. We played for four hours and then we went to Niantic's after party, which I have to say it was free to get into and they give you a drink ticket as you're going in.
1209000	1210000	Nice.
1210000	1213000	Yeah. Right? Like right there. I was like, dang, Niantic knows how to party.
1213000	1225000	And it was in a nice big space. They used the armory. The armory was where the Konami thing I went to like years ago. Right? So it was that same space, but all open and like, no, like, you know, it wasn't segmented a certain way or anything.
1225000	1238000	So it was all open in there and, uh, they, you know, we, we'd had drinks and, you know, we were, you know, there was food for sale and, you know, just to be able to chat and hang out with the people from your team or, you know, even, you know, meet some people from the other team that you've been battling with for a long time.
1238000	1248000	And, you know, all that. So a little bit of mixing there. And then they did some of the announcements. They came up on stage, they did the big, you know, the, the enlightened or the, the enlightened won the series because they won San Francisco.
1248000	1254000	Yay. Everybody clapped and, you know, but the resistance to Kauai. So the other team can feel good, you know, to survey gets a chance to clap.
1254000	1267000	And, um, so, um, they're doing all these announcements and then they, they kind of end it. So, so Ingress is supposed to be also, it's an AR game, not just because it uses real world scenarios, but because technically there's this story.
1267000	1285000	That plays out online and there's a blog that you can go to. And I think the story has to do with like aliens have been discovered and one team of people, the enlightened wants to use what the aliens have to offer for the benefit of all humanity.
1285000	1293000	And the blue team feels that the aliens are trying to enslave humanity. So they're trying to resist this type of change, which is why they're there, the resistance. Right.
1293000	1300000	And I've totally oversimplified the story that for me just boils down to which color is prettier war, green or blue, which is why I play green.
1300000	1311000	So, so anyway, uh, there, there is this whole story behind it. They have characters and everything. So they acted out this whole scene on stage. It was like watching community theater, but whatever.
1311000	1319000	It's, it's fun because it's about a game that you spend a lot of time playing. And, uh, you know, the community managers are talking about some of their events that are coming up and, and one of the characters is on stage going, I have it.
1319000	1327000	I have the truth. I have the, you have to show everybody the truth about the future and all this stuff and holding up something in the air. I couldn't see way in the back.
1327000	1336000	So anyway, it leads to this big unveiling of the trailer for Ingress Prime, which is the new game that Niantic is working on, except it is the old game.
1336000	1346000	It is basically what many of people who've been playing Ingress call Ingress 2.0. So the Pokemon Go creator Niantic, their next game is going to be their first game.
1346000	1358000	And it is essentially a rewrite of the game for the ground up. That's why I call it a new game because they are rewriting Ingress from the ground up, but the game itself, not going to, it's still, you know, they're not like radically changing with the game.
1358000	1360000	So they're going to get rid of the old game?
1360000	1363000	Well, no, this is going to be, it's going to replace your old client.
1363000	1364000	Oh.
1364000	1371000	So one day you're going to go in there and update your game and it's going to be like Ingress, Ingress is now Ingress Prime 2.0. So that's, that's it.
1371000	1381000	But you know, they, and they, they stressed your agent stuff will carry over your level, your badges, everything you've earned in Ingress today is carrying over to this game.
1381000	1388000	But after they did the trailer, they actually said, Oh, by the way, we have some cell phones over here. We'd like you to check out Ingress Prime and tell us what you think of it.
1388000	1394000	So like all of a sudden this became E3 and I was like, go stand in a line to go for 30 minutes to see a game, right? So I did that.
1394000	1400000	So I got to see the Ingress Prime in motion and what was kind of cool about it is that, you know, it's definitely a huge graphic upgrade.
1400000	1407000	You can, you can spin the screen with one finger instead of using, you know, the two fingers and you can go, this is what I thought was really cool.
1407000	1415000	You can zoom underneath a portal so that you can see where the links are going a lot easier and see if things are crossing or not.
1415000	1419000	You know how like sometimes in the game today, it's really hard to tell what the hell is linked to what?
1419000	1423000	Well, they're trying to make that easier in this new client and you can zoom way out.
1423000	1428000	I would say if you zoom way out, you can easily see 10 times as much area as you can now.
1428000	1432000	So I thought that was kind of neat too. So, you know, as an Ingress player, that was exciting.
1432000	1443000	I have some reservations about some of the things I would show, that was shown that really go into a very detailed gameplay mechanical level that I think would bore most of you because I don't think many of you playing, Chris.
1443000	1455000	But I will say, you know, there was some concerns I had about something called Intel because I noticed that when they were in the, they put communications in a separate tab, one of the tabs said Intel.
1455000	1460000	And I actually asked the guy, I said, are they moving Intel from the web onto the app? Is that why that says Intel?
1460000	1463000	And he said, I can't say anything about that. I can't show you that right now.
1463000	1467000	And so that said to me, they might be.
1467000	1475000	So, but to their credit, after the whole demo was over, they actually had a little laptop nearby and they said, we'd like to ask you a few questions about what you saw and how you feel.
1475000	1480000	So they actually asked, you know, what's your agent level? What do you, how much do you play and all this stuff?
1480000	1484000	And they said, what did you like most? What did you not like most? You know, what concerns do you have type of thing.
1484000	1489000	So I was, I felt like I was appropriately able to say what I liked and say what I didn't like.
1489000	1498000	And that it will be heard because, you know, although while this event was fairly crowded, it wasn't more than a couple hundred people and maybe only about a hundred stayed around and watched this demo.
1498000	1503000	So, you know, they're not going to get that much feedback. So I think that's, that's kind of neat.
1503000	1510000	So, yeah, so that's, I got to see the new Ingress Prime. So there you go. So again, I know a lot of you guys don't, don't play the game a lot, but I will say this.
1510000	1513000	You do have this to look forward to here on OLR in the future.
1513000	1520000	Some of the, um, some of the people that I play Ingress with, uh, it's, it's starting to get out there more that I do this show, this Orange Lawns Radio Show.
1520000	1528000	And I've had actually a lot of the, the women that run the faction stuff here, uh, for my team in SAC, they really want to come on this show.
1528000	1536000	So we are going to have, I don't know the date yet, but we are going to have a ladies of Ingress night here at OLR.
1536000	1537000	Nice.
1537000	1544000	So stay tuned for more. If I, if I can get one from the other faction, I'm open to it. So I'm not, it doesn't have to be one side of things.
1544000	1550000	I'll see. I'll see what I can do. I'll see what I can do. I, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know who I can talk to over there.
1550000	1556000	I see. I know one gal, actually I know one gal and if she would be willing to do it, I would really, really love to have her on. So we'll see.
1556000	1562000	You don't know her, but yeah. So I know most of the people, so it's fine. Yeah. Yeah. It's all the same to you. It's all the people that smash your crap in the middle of the night.
1562000	1575000	I know I probably met you once. I don't, I'm sorry. I've been getting a lot of that in comms because I'll occasionally play at the park.
1575000	1583000	Oh yeah. Yeah. And they're like, Oh, Hey, long time. Like, yeah, they're excited to see somebody playing in your area because you know how your area is.
1583000	1591000	I know. That's why I stopped playing. Well then I have literally no time to play. I understand. I understand. I just, I can't.
1591000	1599000	I'm going to take back my work lobby. You do that. I told you there's a smurf that thinks it's his. Oh, I'm going to smack it down.
1599000	1602000	All right. Anyway.
1602000	1608000	So that's, that's my little blurb on Ingress and what happened this weekend. And I had a really good time at the event and then they did today.
1608000	1614000	They did something called mission day, which is all about doing the missions in game where you hack the portals and you, you know.
1614000	1620000	So basically we explore the city and how can we get a little special badge on our profile that says you participated in mission day.
1620000	1625000	But it was actually really neat. Like I had never been with all the times I've been to San Francisco cause I don't live that far from there.
1625000	1632000	I had never been down the walk on pier 14 where you can walk all the way out and like get these really great pictures of the Bay bridge and stuff.
1632000	1638000	So it was neat. So I did that this morning. It only took me about two hours to do what I needed to do. So yeah, it was cool.
1638000	1643000	So I'm excited about that. So I had a great time doing Ingress. So I look forward for Ingress prime coming out.
1643000	1651000	More information is at ingressprime.com and I believe The Verge ran an article that actually has screenshots.
1651000	1658000	I think there's a trailer out there on the YouTubes as well, as well as the demo I saw somebody filmed it, even though it's a big no-no.
1658000	1663000	So there is a leaked demo on YouTube out there where you can watch the whole thing if you're curious about it. So there you go.
1663000	1668000	And if you want to know more about Ingress, if you want to play Ingress, I'm happy to help you out if you go green.
1669000	1677000	All right. Anyway, uh, let's get into some, uh, talk about our gaming weeks, the types of video games we have been playing this week.
1677000	1682000	I guess I've already talked a lot about Ingress that kind of dominated my weekend, but I know you guys have been playing other stuff, right, Jamie?
1682000	1693000	I'm actually restarting Animal Crossing New Leaf because apparently there is support for my weird idea about a person having a mental breakdown and finds herself in the world of Animal Crossing.
1694000	1695000	Okay, I believe that.
1695000	1698000	Where she has a nightly existential crisis at the roost.
1698000	1699000	Mm-hmm.
1699000	1710000	So, I was gonna do it, I actually, um, have the Dolphin emulator, and I was gonna do it on, um, the N64 version so I could take screenshots with that.
1710000	1717000	Um, I mean, and again, I own all of the originals, blah blah blah blah blah, all the stuff. Um, sorry, GameCube version.
1717000	1724000	Um, but, I'm thinking that I like the newer character styles, plus there's more locations in the game that I can do stuff with.
1724000	1738000	So, um, the one thing is that I'm actually trying to find, like, a, and I know that they exist, but sort of like a, uh, a simulated version that I can use, like, direct camera angles in and everything.
1738000	1740000	I found all the textures from New Leaf.
1740000	1743000	So, the textures in the, in the character model.
1743000	1747000	So, anyway, that's been kind of my thing lately, and I'm playing a lot to Pocket Camp. I'm level 34.
1747000	1752000	Would it be fair to say that the mobile, you're level 34?
1752000	1753000	Yes.
1753000	1761000	Okay, I guess I can't talk because I just literally played Ingress all weekend long, so I literally cannot say anything, but I did have a pause moment of shock.
1761000	1763000	All right, that's great.
1763000	1764000	I checked the game three times a day.
1764000	1768000	That's, no, that's, I, again, I can't fucking talk. I played Ingress all weekend.
1768000	1770000	I'm building a convertible right now for Cherry.
1770000	1771000	That's to get her past-
1771000	1778000	You have to build them fucking cars? Like, the, the couches and the, the refrigerators? That's not enough? You have to make them a fucking car?
1778000	1783000	Apollo wants a bass guitar, so I'm doing a bass for him. I'm on my fourth loan.
1783000	1786000	You had to take out a loan to build a bitch a car?
1786000	1787000	No!
1787000	1788000	What is this game teaching people?
1788000	1791000	No, it's for my, my van, my camper, my van again.
1791000	1792000	All right.
1792000	1802000	Um, but I have the 150,000 Bell loan right now, and I was, I was actually thinking about using the mobile version for my, my thing, but-
1802000	1814000	Okay, so I was gonna say, would it be fair to say that because of the mobile Animal Crossing, you've been thinking more about Animal Crossing, and therefore, that has led to, maybe I want to go back and play New Leaf and do this comic thing.
1814000	1816000	I've had the idea to do the webcomic for about two years now.
1816000	1817000	Okay.
1817000	1830000	Um, but I just never put anything to it. I was either gonna hand draw it, you know, which I could still do it hand drawn, but I think it would be a little bit more fun to have screenshots, or at least get some of the locations or something, I don't know.
1830000	1857000	I'm still working out the, the logistics behind it, but, um, I've also been playing Miitomo, and I played some Ingress, because, uh, reasons, and, um, uh, Pokemon Go, and, uh, Idol Poring, and Dragon Age Inquisition, and, um, um, and fucking with people's heads.
1857000	1859000	All right, it's a fun game.
1859000	1861000	All right, Loki, how was your gaming week?
1861000	1881000	Um, it wasn't as fun as I thought it was gonna be, but, um, I, I played, or I finished the story campaign for LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2, and much like, um, god, there was another game I played that was kind of like this too, but it just kind of, it was just over.
1881000	1885000	Like, all of a sudden been playing through levels and all of a sudden it's just done.
1885000	1888000	I was like, that was it? That was the last level?
1888000	1902000	It's just very, I don't know, there wasn't any real memorable moments like there were with even the first LEGO Marvel Super Heroes game, and even the LEGO Avengers game, they had, but it seemed like they put more time into the story and stuff.
1902000	1919000	This one just seems very rushed and content lacking, I mean, because if you look at the LEGO Avengers game, I didn't like that one too much because instead of doing voice acting for a lot of the characters, they just took audio clips from the movies that they're in, because it's based on the Marvel movie universe.
1919000	1927000	And so, it was just kind of like, eh, I like the old voice actors better, and I just really wish they'd used those instead.
1927000	1929000	I wonder if that has to do with the strike.
1929000	1931000	It could have been, maybe.
1931000	1938000	This time though, they did voice actors, they didn't use the same old voice actors, so that was kind of jarring.
1938000	1951000	But, with the last game, the LEGO Avengers game, they had all these hub worlds, and they had Manhattan, because usually you get one giant hub world that you can run around, it's kind of free roaming and stuff, and you can do puzzles and stuff in there, plus they have all the levels.
1951000	1958000	Well, this one had that, and then it had all these other hub worlds that were kind of cool as well, so there's like a lot of content in there.
1958000	1969000	This one doesn't have that. This one has the stupid Chronopolis thing, which is just like tiny pieces of each of these little worlds just jumbled together in this big mess of a world.
1969000	1973000	It's just kind of crap, and it's just very unmemorable and just dumb.
1973000	1976000	And the storyline to the whole thing was kind of lame, too.
1976000	1983000	The only thing that was good about it was they had some pretty good boss fights. I think they're interesting designs.
1983000	1991000	But, it's just like the Kang character is just very lame. Just the boss fight at the end was kind of stupid.
1991000	2003000	Because he fights Captain America, and Captain America gets big for some reason, like this giant kaiju fight almost, and it should have been cool, but it was pretty lame.
2003000	2009000	So, I don't know. But, I still have to play through it to unlock all the characters and do all that.
2009000	2013000	But, it seems like it's more of a chore now than anything, just because my kids want to play it.
2013000	2019000	I didn't get to play any of the VR stuff. I kept looking at it, but once again, my wife is very much monopolizing the TV.
2019000	2028000	And there's not a really good place to set up VR while she's watching TV and have it not interfere with the TV.
2028000	2031000	So, unfortunately, I didn't get around to that.
2032000	2042000	Also, I did play a little bit more of LEGO DC Universe 2, which was LEGO Batman to DC Universe.
2042000	2046000	I'm really trying to get away from LEGO games, though, because I've got a lot of other stuff to play.
2046000	2050000	South Park! I still have South Park. I bought that, downloaded it, haven't played it yet.
2050000	2055000	But, I do want to get into that. I just wanted to finish the one game first before I got started on something else.
2056000	2061000	So, I'll probably do that, but I'm very much looking forward to playing South Park. I hear it's really good.
2061000	2064000	Alright. I understand the struggle of having a game that you haven't played yet.
2064000	2071000	I got my copy of Xenoblade Chronicles 2 on Friday, and I haven't even opened the package yet.
2071000	2076000	Because I left Friday night, and I've been being a nerd on other stuff all weekend long.
2076000	2080000	So, hoping to maybe get into that a little bit tonight, if I don't just pass out early.
2080000	2082000	But, if nothing else, I'll start playing that tomorrow.
2082000	2085000	I've got six to eight VR games I have yet to play.
2085000	2093000	Like, I've got just a ton of stuff that I bought over sales and stuff, and I've been meaning to play all of it.
2093000	2095000	I just haven't gotten around to playing it yet.
2096000	2103000	Alright. My gaming week. I have not played a lot besides Ingress this weekend, obviously. It was a lot.
2103000	2108000	Well, actually, I was staying with our pal JD, who you see in chat a lot, and he's been on the show before.
2108000	2113000	And he was showing me Jackbox 4, which somehow, I hadn't gotten around to picking up yet.
2113000	2117000	I don't know, like, I haven't had people over, so that hasn't been a reason for me to download it yet.
2117000	2118000	I'm sure I'll get it eventually.
2118000	2120000	But he was like, have you played Jackbox 4 yet?
2120000	2123000	And I was like, actually, now that you mention it, no I haven't.
2123000	2129000	And I always support the Jackbox games, so it's weird that I kind of, like, this one just slipped on my radar.
2129000	2134000	So he fired it up so we could play Fibbage 3, which I really, that was really the only game we got to play.
2134000	2140000	He was telling me about some of the other games, like the monster, the game that sounds like it's freaking Grindr, but with monsters, and that's really funny.
2140000	2145000	And I would really like to invite Jackbox back on the show, because I want to know if they did research by using dating apps.
2145000	2149000	But anyway, there's all these other fun games in there.
2149000	2155000	But I got to play Fibbage 3, and that was great, because it has, like, this very, like, 70s look to it.
2155000	2166000	And I love the little transition, uses, transitions when you're picking the category, uses all these stock photography from the 70s of, like, women in 70s style bathing suits,
2166000	2172000	and men with the big bushy mustache, Burt Reynolds mustaches and stuff that is, like, the horrible fashion of the 70s, what looks horrible now.
2172000	2177000	You know, and all that stuff. I just, I got a kick out of the look and how that whole game looked.
2177000	2179000	And they tried to do some new things with the formula, too.
2179000	2183000	I mean, it's still Fibbage at the end of the day, but I like that they had, like, social media questions.
2183000	2188000	Like, one of the questions we had was some supermodel had posted on her Twitter,
2188000	2193000	I'm trying to set blank as my desktop picture, and you had to, you know, fill in the blank with what it was.
2193000	2197000	And I fooled JD, I put Obama, and he guessed it. He guessed it was Obama.
2197000	2201000	And I think the real answer was her boobs. Yeah, the real answer was her boobs.
2201000	2204000	And I thought, oh, the game's not going to put her boobs in there.
2204000	2208000	And I think I put the runway or something really dumb that somebody else had put in.
2208000	2212000	And yeah, the answer, it turns out, she had tweeted that she wanted to put her boobs as her background picture.
2212000	2215000	Would you ever do that, DarkSagra? No.
2215000	2216000	Fuck no.
2216000	2218000	No, I wouldn't put my butt as my background picture, either.
2218000	2221000	It's just a little bit, I guess, you know, supermodels are different.
2221000	2224000	I think I could put supermodel's boobs as my background picture.
2224000	2226000	That's not the same thing.
2229000	2233000	Anyway, so that was something I got to learn playing Fibbage.
2233000	2238000	Oh, and then the bonus round was different, because the bonus round was blank and blank.
2239000	2241000	So it was like a pair of things that went together.
2241000	2248000	And I think it was something about Richard Nixon's food you would never guess that he liked was blank and blank.
2248000	2251000	And I don't know, I put something disgusting, like peanut butter and pickles or something.
2251000	2254000	And I think I actually did, I tricked JD again.
2254000	2257000	And you might think I'm a really good liar, but he was a better liar, actually.
2257000	2259000	I fell for his answer like every fucking time.
2259000	2264000	Turns out, did you know the real answer, I mean, spoiler alert, but did you know the real answer to that is ketchup and cottage cheese?
2264000	2265000	Ew.
2265000	2266000	Yeah, right? Disgusting.
2266000	2270000	My granddaddy used to eat ketchup on everything, including cabbage.
2270000	2271000	And cottage cheese?
2271000	2273000	And cottage cheese and eggs.
2273000	2275000	I don't know about that. Alright.
2275000	2276000	Anyway.
2276000	2281000	So that's a pretty awesome looking, I'm watching the leaked footage of the, uh...
2281000	2282000	Oh, the Ingress 2.0?
2282000	2283000	Ingress 2.0.
2283000	2284000	Yeah, and I told you about that?
2284000	2285000	Yeah, or Ingress Prime.
2285000	2288000	It's pretty, it's so much, but it's pretty.
2288000	2290000	It's very, like, what drew me to Ingress...
2290000	2292000	It looks a lot cooler, I guess.
2292000	2295000	What drew me to Ingress in the first place was I was like, oh, it looks like Tron, but in the real world.
2295000	2298000	And now that I'm looking at Ingress Prime, I'm like, now it really looks like Tron.
2298000	2299000	Yeah.
2299000	2300000	It's very cool. Anyway.
2300000	2302000	Um, and then I played some World of Warcraft.
2302000	2304000	Not a lot, but a little bit.
2304000	2308000	And, um, I don't know, it's just some other little stuff here and there, and that's really about it.
2308000	2312000	So, um, this next week I'm looking forward to actually sending out my Xenoblade Chronicles 2,
2312000	2314000	because I bought that, but I just haven't got started yet.
2314000	2316000	So I'm hoping to get into that.
2316000	2318000	Um, so that was it for my gaming week.
2318000	2321000	So, I will mention quickly, you can always follow us on Twitter.
2321000	2323000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
2323000	2325000	We're also on Facebook. Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio.
2325000	2327000	And you can always send us emails.
2327000	2329000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
2329000	2332000	Unfortunately, we don't have any emails for you to read tonight,
2332000	2334000	but hopefully we'll get some for next week.
2334000	2336000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
2336000	2340000	I'm curious what kind of games you guys might play outdoors.
2340000	2343000	You know, we talked about Ingress, Pokemon Go.
2343000	2345000	Is there another AR game that you're into?
2345000	2347000	Well, it's not an AR game.
2347000	2349000	Don't send in sports as a joke answer.
2349000	2351000	Like, I get that that's an obvious answer.
2351000	2352000	I mean, technology-based thing.
2352000	2355000	They have one that's, I don't know how well this would work,
2355000	2357000	but it's supposed to be like laser tag.
2357000	2361000	I've seen like the guns at the store you can buy,
2361000	2364000	and they've got like an app that you, it works with,
2364000	2366000	and it's like you play laser tag with that.
2366000	2370000	I just like, I can't imagine that would be very good.
2370000	2372000	Eww.
2372000	2374000	Apparently, DarkSakurai agrees.
2374000	2375000	Eww.
2375000	2376000	Okay, so this is why-
2376000	2377000	Ketchup is gross.
2377000	2379000	No, I want to point this out. I want to point this out.
2379000	2382000	Rama has just reinforced single-handedly in our chat
2382000	2385000	over at live.bognetwork.com why we don't click random links,
2385000	2387000	and I made the mistake because I go, oh, it's Rama.
2387000	2389000	He's not going to Rickroll me in the middle of the show.
2389000	2391000	Rama knows better. He produces his own show.
2391000	2393000	So what did he fucking put in chat?
2393000	2396000	A tweet of a Pop-Tart covered in ketchup.
2396000	2397000	Eww.
2397000	2401000	So, in the future, when I don't click your links in chat during the show,
2401000	2403000	I want you to go and say, thanks, Rama.
2403000	2404000	Thanks for that.
2404000	2407000	That's, yes, just remember the ketchup covered Pop-Tart
2407000	2408000	that made Rob not click the links anymore.
2408000	2409000	Pizza, Pop-Tart, or something like that.
2409000	2411000	I thought they had, like, something like that.
2411000	2415000	If it's possible on the internet, I'm sure they did it somewhere.
2415000	2416000	All right.
2416000	2418000	Let's get into some other news.
2418000	2421000	DarkSakurai, I know you had a few things you want to bring to the table tonight.
2421000	2423000	DarkSakurai, why don't you start us off with some news.
2423000	2427000	Osaka has new ambassadors. It's Pikachu and Hello Kitty.
2427000	2430000	Why can America not have cool stuff?
2430000	2432000	Why, Japan?
2432000	2435000	I'm moving because I want-
2435000	2437000	Well, one of our buddies is there right now.
2437000	2440000	Yeah, buddy, give me a place to live.
2440000	2442000	Actually, I'll be perfectly honest.
2442000	2447000	My goal ages and ages ago was to live in Kyoto.
2447000	2448000	Still kind of a goal.
2448000	2453000	You know, if something happens to Dan, you may be doing OLR across the ocean.
2453000	2456000	But I just think it's pretty cool.
2456000	2462000	They basically are promoting Osaka as the 2025 ex-Boho city.
2462000	2464000	So that's pretty cool.
2464000	2467000	And I have completely different news, too.
2467000	2469000	It's about Cuphead.
2469000	2470000	Okay.
2470000	2472000	You know how Cuphead is hard as balls?
2472000	2474000	Yeah, why, yes I do.
2474000	2475000	Actually, balls aren't really hard.
2475000	2478000	I was able to beat the tutorial, though, which is why I'm allowed to do this program.
2478000	2479000	Yeah.
2479000	2484000	Well, Cuphead got a patch to polish it up just a teensy more.
2484000	2489000	And it basically did away with some of the little bugs that people found.
2489000	2494000	Like replicating Mugman many, many times.
2494000	2497000	Does that mean they made the game harder?
2497000	2498000	Yes.
2498000	2499000	Because you can't exploit it anymore.
2499000	2500000	They can't cheat.
2500000	2503000	It actually, in some ways, made things a little bit easier, too.
2503000	2506000	So it fixed random freezes.
2506000	2507000	Yeah, that's good.
2507000	2509000	And it improved saving and loading.
2509000	2513000	There's nothing more infuriating than a difficult video game
2513000	2517000	than a difficult video game where you lose all your progress thanks to a freeze.
2517000	2519000	So that does make the process easier.
2519000	2527000	It left the ability to charge your weapon as maintained through parry.
2527000	2533000	And you can unequip your secondary weapons from the equipment menu.
2533000	2537000	And just fixing a lot of weird little glitches on there.
2537000	2539000	It fixed some of the hit boxes.
2539000	2545000	And yeah, a few things worse, a few things better.
2545000	2548000	Loki, I think you should put that on your list of things to play as Cuphead.
2548000	2549000	I have played Cuphead.
2549000	2550000	Have you?
2550000	2551000	I didn't realize that.
2551000	2552000	Yeah, it's fun.
2552000	2554000	I'm wrestling here at the show a few weeks ago.
2554000	2555000	I need to play it more.
2555000	2556000	I played a little bit on Twitch that one night,
2556000	2560000	and I played a little more after that, but I need to try to finish it.
2560000	2561000	It's really fun.
2561000	2563000	Yeah, it definitely is difficult.
2563000	2565000	I've watched all the boss videos and stuff like that.
2565000	2568000	It's one of those games that's going to get completely lost
2568000	2572000	in these end of the year game award stuff because of Zelda and Mario.
2572000	2574000	I don't know if it will.
2574000	2578000	Well, it didn't get nominated for a game of the year, anyway.
2578000	2581000	I would have expected this game to be game of the year material for a lot of people.
2581000	2582000	I really do.
2582000	2584000	I don't know.
2584000	2587000	Well, certainly when it comes to art direction and style.
2587000	2589000	It doesn't have the replayability for that, I don't think.
2589000	2591000	But that's not a bad thing, though.
2591000	2593000	That's like Mega Man.
2593000	2596000	I mean, it has Mega Man replayability, whereas it's linear.
2596000	2601000	Okay, speaking of Mega Man, when I first played Mega Man 2 on the NES,
2602000	2605000	I had that moment of, oh, my God, I'm playing a cartoon.
2605000	2609000	When you see some of those sprites playing, I'm playing a fucking cartoon.
2609000	2614000	But then when I played Cuphead, no, really, I am fucking playing a cartoon right now.
2614000	2621000	It's another example of one of those, just when you think graphics can't get any better, here you go.
2621000	2626000	And it's not that the graphics are particularly anything more stunning than, say, Destiny 2,
2626000	2628000	which is a great graphical game in a different way.
2628000	2632000	But Cuphead, because of that art direction and the art style they picked,
2632000	2635000	it looks like something they picked straight up out of the 30s.
2635000	2637000	It's pretty astounding.
2637000	2640000	So if you haven't played Cuphead, you really should check it out.
2640000	2643000	I worry it's one of those games that most people will watch on Twitch
2643000	2647000	and be like, nah, I'm not going to play that, but it looks good.
2647000	2651000	Well, looks good isn't going to give the developers incentive to make another one.
2651000	2655000	Although I heard it did sell very well, so we're probably going to get another one.
2655000	2658000	Or at least that studio will get the opportunity to make another game
2658000	2662000	that hopefully has a great style of whatever it is they choose.
2664000	2666000	All right, I think that is that all you had, Dark Soccer?
2666000	2668000	Let's go to Loki for a few more stories.
2668000	2673000	Including, why don't you tell us about the breakfast box that's getting tweeted everywhere right now.
2673000	2677000	Well, I was going to talk about that in a second, but first I want to actually talk about...
2677000	2679000	Fine, no, I'm just kidding.
2679000	2683000	Well, since we were talking about Mega Man, I wanted to mention that there is a Mega Man anniversary
2683000	2685000	thing that's going to be happening tomorrow.
2685000	2690000	So on December 4th, Capcom is actually going to be doing a live stream of Mega Man
2690000	2693000	for the 30th anniversary of the Mega Man series.
2693000	2698000	And so it's going to start at, looks like 11 a.m. Pacific time.
2698000	2703000	And they said one hour prior to the stream, they're going to be airing a streamer showdown pre-show
2703000	2706000	with trivia and guest appearances of that.
2706000	2709000	So my guess is they're going to announce something during this.
2709000	2712000	Did you hear about who retweeted that tweet?
2712000	2720000	No, Sony and Nintendo both retweeted that tweet.
2720000	2723000	So, draw the conclusion that you will.
2723000	2727000	There's a lot of people theorizing that the conclusion, a lot of people jumping into,
2727000	2732000	Mega Man Legacy Collection on the Switch, which would be great.
2732000	2738000	I think that's something, you know, I still have not bought that Saturday morning Disney game collection
2738000	2740000	because I want it on the Switch.
2740000	2742000	Maybe the Mega Man collection thing will come out on the Switch.
2742000	2744000	I think that would be great if it did.
2744000	2746000	Or maybe they're going to do Mega Man 11.
2746000	2750000	Maybe they're going to do some big thing tomorrow.
2750000	2752000	Mega Man Legends Collection.
2752000	2754000	I'm kind of okay with that actually.
2754000	2756000	One and two, I mean.
2756000	2758000	Or an X collection even. I don't know. So we'll see.
2758000	2760000	I mean, it could be literally anything tomorrow. So we'll see.
2760000	2761000	Yeah, that'd be cool.
2761000	2762000	Excited about that.
2762000	2763000	That's something.
2763000	2766000	But yes, to allude to what Rob was talking about earlier,
2766000	2770000	there is, of course, a brand new cereal hitting the market.
2770000	2774000	It's the Super Mario Brothers Cereal.
2774000	2775000	It's for breakfast now.
2775000	2777000	Nintendo, it's a cereal.
2777000	2778000	Wow.
2778000	2780000	So they've got this new cereal that's coming out.
2780000	2782000	It's I guess through Kellogg's.
2782000	2789000	And it's what's kind of unique about it aside from the fact that it's got Mario Brothers marshmallows and stuff like that in there.
2789000	2792000	And we all know marshmallows are the best part of any breakfast.
2792000	2794000	Marshmallows are disgusting. You shut your mouth.
2795000	2799000	Even the gross dehydrated marshmallows you get in breakfast cereal.
2799000	2801000	I love the dehydrated ones in.
2801000	2803000	Here's my problem.
2803000	2805000	Now I'm going to derail you, you son of a bitch.
2805000	2806000	That's fine.
2806000	2807000	Go right ahead.
2807000	2811000	I don't. Okay, this is where everybody's going to go, Rob, you are a fucking freak. You ready?
2811000	2815000	I don't like milk and cereal at all.
2815000	2817000	And so people go, well, how do you eat your cereal?
2817000	2819000	And I go, easy.
2819000	2822000	You put it in a bowl, you get a spoon, and you eat the cereal out of the bowl.
2822000	2824000	You don't need anything in it.
2824000	2831000	But in those types of cereals where you have dehydrated parts in it, it kind of makes those marshmallows a little bit nastier, I think.
2831000	2834000	It makes them slimy if you like put milk in there.
2834000	2835000	Yeah.
2835000	2840000	But I like them when they're dehydrated and you kind of chew on them and it's like chewing through like high density foam or something like that.
2843000	2845000	See, I wouldn't know. I don't like milk and cereal.
2845000	2848000	Maybe I'm lactose intolerant.
2848000	2849000	Sometimes.
2849000	2855000	I'm actually not, but I just don't, I don't, I don't like that much milk. That's the problem.
2855000	2865000	Well, sometimes this is why I do too. Like if you don't like tons of milk and cereal, you get a giant like oversized cup of cereal and a glass of milk and you just down the cereal first.
2865000	2870000	And you eat it and then you drink some milk when your mouth gets too dry.
2870000	2873000	For some reason, that I'm okay with.
2873000	2879000	I've done that like cause there's some cereals that are better dry than they are with milk.
2879000	2885000	For example, one that I feel really loses all of its flavor in milk is Cinnamon Toast Crunch.
2885000	2891000	Cause all the cinnamon gets washed off and you have this like lame ass soggy shit with some cinnamon on it.
2891000	2894000	This is the best part of OLR is knowing you're not alone.
2894000	2896000	SSG100Matt says, Rob, you're not alone.
2896000	2898000	And Dark Tetsuya says, I don't blame you Rob.
2898000	2902000	And JD says, what do you do instead? Use orange juice?
2902000	2904000	You're all gross.
2904000	2907000	Well, clearly the answer is we use ketchup.
2907000	2910000	Ketchup is also gross.
2910000	2912000	Why do people eat disgusting things?
2912000	2913000	Soy sauce?
2913000	2918000	That's what I ask when Loki brings a fucking sandwich from Subway loaded with extra mayo.
2918000	2920000	But I love mayo.
2920000	2924000	Here's why I ask for extra mayo. It's because of their own incompetence.
2924000	2927000	It's not because I like a ton of mayo on my sandwich.
2927000	2932000	It's because I want the ratio of mayo to be greater than the amount of mustard they put on there.
2932000	2934000	Cause otherwise the mustard just overpowers everything.
2934000	2936000	What's the problem? I love mustard.
2936000	2938000	You put light on the mustard.
2938000	2939000	Mustard is also gross.
2939000	2942000	They just go way crazy with the mustard and mayo on there.
2942000	2944000	So I have to ask them to put extra mayo.
2944000	2947000	And I mean a little bit extra mayo, but then they go fucking crazy with it.
2947000	2950000	Like there's just like a two inch thick layer of mayo in there.
2950000	2952000	I was like, dude, that's a little much.
2952000	2955000	I literally just gagged. I literally just gagged.
2956000	2959000	Sorry, I didn't mean to give you that mental picture, but...
2960000	2962000	It's just, it's their own incompetence.
2963000	2965000	Just make the sandwich like I want it.
2965000	2966000	It's not so hard.
2966000	2969000	Alright, where the hell were we? God damn it, you derailed everything.
2969000	2970000	Cereal. Oh yeah, cereal.
2970000	2972000	So what else about Super Mario cereal?
2972000	2978000	So the thing that's unique about it though is it has an amiibo thing on it.
2978000	2980000	Yes, the cereal box is its own amiibo.
2980000	2984000	Can't really store it with the rest of your amiibos, but hey, you can at least scan the box.
2984000	2986000	Yeah, all you need is a little chip, right?
2986000	2992000	Yeah, you can scan the box with your Nintendo Switch controller or Joy-Con or whatever and do that.
2992000	3000000	Or you can totally be the lead hacker because your Switch is fucking portable and just go to the fucking supermarket and scan all the boxes with your Switch.
3000000	3001000	Smart man.
3001000	3003000	Without even having to buy the cereal.
3003000	3007000	That's right, because they can't afford to put that chip, that wrap on everything, huh?
3007000	3009000	Yeah, you can't do anything. You can't do shit with that.
3009000	3011000	It's just fucking just go to the store and...
3011000	3015000	Did you really think of that yourself or did you see somebody on Twitter or YouTube do that where they went to the supermarket?
3015000	3020000	No, I thought about it because when I saw that I'm like, well, what's going to stop people from just going to the store and doing that?
3020000	3023000	Do you want to go to Save Mart, get my Switch, go to Save Mart right now?
3023000	3027000	I don't even know if it's out there. I didn't see it at the store.
3029000	3030000	Oh my god, I love it.
3030000	3032000	I thought about stopping the store and getting some, but...
3032000	3034000	Well, I mean, it makes sense to it. Like, I was...
3034000	3039000	Okay, so everybody's thinking about like figures. Like, do you get a toy in your food again?
3039000	3044000	No. Think of the amiibo cards, you guys. They had the Animal Crossing amiibo cards, okay?
3044000	3047000	So they just made the bottom of the box or whatever, one of those cards.
3047000	3052000	Well, is it built into the box or is there a card in the box?
3052000	3057000	Like in little individual wrap? Because if that's the case, Loki, your trick's not going to work.
3057000	3059000	Because maybe they just put an amiibo card in the box.
3059000	3062000	I thought it was attached to the back of the box, but I could be wrong. I don't know.
3062000	3064000	It would make sense. We'll see.
3064000	3068000	Alright, Bobby Black Wolf in chat says it's out on the 11th or something.
3068000	3072000	And Black Wolf says they claim that the amiibo part is on the back of the box.
3072000	3074000	Alright, so it's a giant amiibo card, basically.
3075000	3076000	Interesting.
3076000	3081000	Yeah. And apparently, what it does is it gives you gold coins or hearts.
3082000	3087000	Oh, and Akuma JP says in Japan, they have an aluminum sticker over the chip.
3087000	3089000	You have to peel it to scan it.
3090000	3092000	Well, I'm going to tell you right now.
3092000	3096000	Akuma JP, I know there's some cultural differences here, but here's my question.
3096000	3099000	Do you have a store called Walmart in Japan?
3099000	3101000	Because I'm going to tell you what's going to happen.
3101000	3102000	They have Costco.
3102000	3104000	I'm going to tell you what's going to happen here in the US.
3104000	3108000	You're going to go look at that cereal aisle and all that fucking aluminum will have been peeled back already.
3110000	3112000	I don't know why. It's just random.
3112000	3114000	And it's something specific about Walmarts.
3116000	3117000	It's quality of customer.
3118000	3119000	It's the culture.
3120000	3122000	Do they still have that blog, People of Walmart?
3123000	3124000	I'm sure they do.
3124000	3129000	Ok, Akuma, if you want to see what America's like, go look for the blog called People of Walmart.
3131000	3133000	And that's what it's like living here.
3134000	3138000	Alright, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, sir, put the switch away.
3139000	3143000	They're not going to yell at me at the grocery store over having a Nintendo Switch out.
3144000	3146000	Especially if, no, here's what I'll do.
3146000	3147000	I know what I'll do.
3147000	3148000	This is how I don't get yelled at.
3149000	3152000	I will let a child that I've kidnapped hold the switch.
3154000	3155000	That way I won't get yelled at.
3156000	3157000	That's a good idea, right?
3157000	3160000	Because you're not going to yell at my pretend kid for bringing the switch.
3161000	3165000	Child kidnapping, well, geez, you're just lining up right for Congress, you know?
3166000	3167000	You have what it takes to be in politics.
3168000	3169000	Vote Rob Roberts 2020.
3170000	3171000	What do I have to say?
3173000	3178000	Alright, Vidpower in chat says, the amiibo prize for scanning the cereal box doesn't seem too amazing.
3179000	3180000	You get, like, a heart.
3181000	3185000	Dungeonbuster in chat says, we have a switch in aisle 4, repeat, security, we have a switch in aisle 4.
3186000	3192000	And Akuma JP regarding Walmart says, I see it on YouTube, my eyes roll so hard.
3193000	3198000	And SSJ100 Matt says, dress Mr. Smoosh as a kid and put him in a stroller.
3199000	3203000	The sad thing is he probably, Mr. Smoosh would probably do it.
3207000	3208000	I love it.
3209000	3216000	Bobby Blackwolf says, yeah, it just tells you that you have a delicious amiibo and it finds a power moon like all the other amiibo do.
3217000	3218000	So, there you go.
3219000	3223000	Alright, but that's, I mean, I almost think, I don't even think the amiibo thing's that big a deal.
3224000	3225000	Like, I really don't.
3225000	3230000	I think it's more like, hey, hey, Nintendo cereal is, like, coming back. Like, it's, I mean, it's not the same cereal.
3231000	3237000	That's so cool, though. It would be even cooler, like, if it unlocked a cereal box character skin for Super Mario Maker or something.
3238000	3240000	What the fuck? A cereal Mario skin?
3241000	3242000	Yeah, cereal box.
3243000	3246000	Whatever, they have, like, springboards and shit in there.
3247000	3250000	A cardboard, you want, like, solid snake hiding in a cardboard box Mario?
3250000	3258000	Like, I want a cereal box. I mean, what, they've got, like, you can do the, like, warp pipes and question blocks and in the springs and stuff like that, so why not?
3259000	3261000	Yeah, when I think of Mario Brothers, I think of cereal, yeah.
3262000	3265000	It's Super Mario Maker and they have a bunch of weird shit in there.
3268000	3271000	Alright, no, it's, it's, I'm just teasing you, it's fine. Alright, what else? New story.
3272000	3281000	Alright, so, we can talk a little bit briefly about more EA shit. So, this is still kind of off of the whole Star Wars Battlefront II bullshit.
3282000	3289000	So, of course, you know, in response to the, you know, backlash against it is more excuses on why they didn't do things the way they did.
3290000	3300000	So, one thing they said is, well, we couldn't possibly do Battlefront II cosmetics in the loot boxes because it would break the canon.
3301000	3304000	It would break the canon of Star Wars. Except...
3305000	3306000	Like, they haven't rewritten it 50,000 times.
3307000	3315000	Well, except that they had customization in the last game. They have customization hidden in the code of this game.
3316000	3322000	And there's also the stupid Star Wars Kinect game, which just broke all of the canons, so, whatever.
3323000	3328000	Would you please reference the quote about Pink Darth Vader? Because that's the one that pissed me the fuck off.
3328000	3331000	Uh, yes. Let me see if I can actually find that.
3332000	3337000	He said something like, you wouldn't want to play as Pink Darth Vader. And my reaction was-
3338000	3339000	Bitch, I would.
3340000	3345000	The fuck I wouldn't. Like, maybe I would buy this fucking game if I could play as Pink Darth Vader. That sounds fucking rad.
3346000	3354000	Yeah, unfortunately, this article does not have the quote in there, but basically it was something to the effect of, like, yes, White Darth Vader would, you know, break the canon.
3355000	3357000	And no one wants to play as Pink Darth Vader or something like that.
3358000	3363000	You shut your dirty little mouth. I know lots of people that would play as Pink Darth Vader.
3364000	3369000	So, it was just like, um, yeah, let's see. Okay, I think I have the exact one here, so, let's see.
3370000	3377000	So, one thing we're very focused on and extremely focused on is not violating the canon of Star Wars.
3378000	3386000	It's an amazing brand that's been built over many, many years, and so if you did a bunch of cosmetic things, you might start to violate canon, right?
3386000	3392000	Darth Vader in white probably doesn't make sense versus black, not to mention you probably don't want Darth Vader in pink.
3393000	3396000	No offense to pink, but I don't think that's right in the canon.
3397000	3404000	Number one, I'm offended. Number two, if we survive the Star Wars Christmas special, we will survive Pink Darth Vader.
3405000	3410000	In fact, I guarantee you Pink Darth Vader will be better than the Star Wars Christmas special and Star Wars Connect.
3411000	3415000	Or did anyone tell him this is a fucking video game and you're not writing stories for Star Wars?
3416000	3422000	I mean, unless they're saying that these characters that they're creating for this game are part of the canon now, which I doubt it.
3423000	3430000	Um, it was just dumb. So, that was the excuse that they made, and like I said, people did some digging in the code of the game and,
3431000	3434000	Oh, what the hell is this? There's some fucking cosmetic shit hidden in here.
3435000	3438000	Oh, but we can't do that because that will violate canon.
3439000	3441000	Alright. So, anyways, so there's that. On top of that-
3442000	3443000	There's your weekly point in laugh at EA.
3443000	3445000	Yes, exactly. So then, of course, um-
3446000	3447000	Can we just give that a stupid award?
3448000	3449000	Sure. I haven't done one in a while.
3450000	3460000	Aside from that game and Need for Speed, another game that just recently was part of this whole EA early access thing was the EA Sports UFC 3.
3461000	3467000	Which also apparently has the same pay-to-win loot box system, and it's even worse in Star Wars.
3467000	3474000	Because the reason why, they have, um, cards in the game to actually affect your strikes in there.
3475000	3481000	So, if you have enough, you know, if you pay enough money, your punches are actually gonna be more effective than your opponent's punches.
3482000	3484000	So, it's just ridiculous that they're- and they're gonna keep doing it.
3485000	3490000	And one of the other things that they said too is that they're gonna, you know, still try to keep these microtransactions in the game.
3490000	3498000	So, it's- obviously, this is the path that they're wanting to go on with this stuff. And apparently, it's just ruining these games.
3501000	3502000	Next.
3502000	3503000	Next.
3503000	3507000	I'm gonna do this MTV early 2000s style.
3508000	3509000	Next.
3509000	3515000	Alright. So, um, as you know, the game awards are right around the corner, so that's gonna be something we'll be seeing pretty soon.
3515000	3522000	Um, one thing, though, which I expect to be there, is a new trailer for Death Stranding.
3523000	3527000	And I think it's also gonna be a little bit confirmed, since, uh, Guillermo del Toro is gonna be there.
3528000	3534000	How about, if, I mean, trailer, okay, whatever, how about a glimpse of, like, what the game really looks like?
3535000	3542000	Like, is it survival horror? Is it strategy? Is it- is it MMO? No, I know it's not MMO.
3542000	3543000	I just wanna see more.
3543000	3544000	Yeah, right? Yeah.
3544000	3545000	I just wanna see more.
3545000	3546000	Yeah.
3546000	3551000	Um, so, that should be coming pretty soon. Um, I think that's later this week, so-
3551000	3552000	It is. I think it's Friday.
3552000	3553000	Thursday or Friday, yeah.
3553000	3554000	Yeah.
3554000	3558000	Um, so definitely can't wait to check that out. Um, be hyped for that.
3558000	3565000	Good luck with the game awards. I know we're sometimes critical of these, you know, gaming award shows, but, like, I- I will give credit where credit's due.
3566000	3577000	I think Jeff Keighley's really trying. Like, I think he's really trying more than, like, Spike TV and that stuff would let him, because you have all these, you know, people in a boardroom that think they know what gamers want.
3577000	3581000	And I think Jeff Keighley has his pulse a little bit- his finger a little bit better on the pulse of that.
3581000	3588000	I think there's still some weird stuff that happens at those shows, but it's, for the most part, it's better than it was, and it can only go up from here, I think.
3588000	3590000	So, I'm looking forward to seeing this.
3591000	3609000	Um, since we were talking about Mario a little bit ago and Animal Crossing, uh, Pocket Camp, uh, we can't forget the last big Nintendo, well, we're gonna totally ignore the whole Fire Emblem game, but the last big Nintendo game, um, on mobile platforms, which will be Super Mario Run.
3609000	3619000	And in 2017, Super Mario Run was the most downloaded game on Android. So, apparently they're doing something right. I honestly never played it on Android.
3620000	3622000	My son did, though.
3623000	3628000	But not- I wonder, was it the most downloaded game on iOS? I wonder. Probably not.
3628000	3629000	Uh, I don't think so.
3629000	3640000	Because they're not touted there, or maybe those rankings don't come out until close to the end of the year, because I think iTunes will start its whole best of 2017 about, probably two weeks before the end of the year, because they take the holiday week off.
3640000	3648000	So, probably the week before that, you're gonna start seeing the whole best of 2017, as if there was anything good about this year.
3649000	3653000	There was some good music, some good movies, some really good movies. So, yeah.
3653000	3664000	Alright, um, another game that's gonna be coming soon to consoles, uh, DayZ, which is actually leaving early access, um, it's gonna be coming to Xbox One next year.
3664000	3673000	They've been talking a little bit about the development of the game and how it's gonna play out on the Xbox One. Originally, they were saying that the game was gonna hit 60 FPS on the Xbox One X.
3673000	3680000	However, that's been retracted now, and it's gonna run at 30 FPS, which is kind of disappointing, especially if you're comparing it to PC.
3680000	3694000	Um, but at least they're gonna say that, um, yeah, I guess they have, uh, DayZ is gonna be, you know, the game and the platform, and it says that we intend on keeping DayZ alive for as long as it's viable.
3695000	3703000	And I guess the release version one, it's gonna be, they said it's not the end of the content update, so, interesting.
3703000	3713000	I guess, um, I haven't really heard too much about DayZ in a while. I know with PUBG out and everything, it kind of seems to be a lot of people forgetting about DayZ in there.
3713000	3716000	So, interesting to see that that's still going.
3716000	3729000	Um, as I was talking a little bit about VR stuff earlier, um, there's actually been a pretty big year for VR, so, it looks like one million VR headsets have, um, shipped, I guess, in a single quarter for the first time.
3729000	3738000	So, um, this is from, I guess, a market research firm called Canalysis, which broke down, um, the market by platform.
3738000	3745000	PlayStation VR shipped the most with over 490,000 units in the third financial quarter of this year.
3745000	3748000	Of course, that includes July, August, and September.
3748000	3756000	Oculus shipped, um, 210,000 units of the Rift, and the HTC Vive sold 160,000 units.
3756000	3759000	I'm assuming the Vive sold less because it was more expensive.
3759000	3765000	But, um, good to see that the platform's still going, and there's definitely a lot of content out.
3765000	3776000	I still think it can do even better, and especially now with some of these, um, other companies coming out with a little bit more affordable headsets, it'd be interesting to see how well those do.
3776000	3790000	Although, the new Windows one I saw, the one that they had from Microsoft didn't look that great because their price point on it was originally going to be lower than everybody else, but then the Rift dropped its price, and so now it's kind of equal with that.
3790000	3795000	Unfortunately, spec-wise, it's not equal with that, and so it's like, eh, you need to drop it further.
3795000	3796000	Yeah.
3796000	3803000	But I'll be curious to see, um, how that turns out. I mean, I'm, I'm ready for the future where I do everything in VR.
3803000	3804000	I'm ready.
3804000	3805000	You ready for it? I'm ready.
3805000	3806000	I'm ready to play Desert Bus in VR.
3806000	3811000	I'm also, I'm also ready, yes. Well, I don't want to play Desert Bus in VR, but there's a thing that you can do now.
3811000	3827000	So, yes, Desert Bus VR, you can, uh, check it out. Of course, this was, um, featured in, um, I think it was, I don't know if, yeah, they were doing that as part of the whole, uh, Desert Bus for Hope, the 11th annual one.
3827000	3839000	So I guess they were playing, uh, Desert Bus VR, and, um, and it's out for, it's a free download on Steam for the Vive and the Rift, and of course, Desert Bus for those who may not remember.
3839000	3850000	It is a game that came out of, um, what was it, the Penn and Teller, I don't remember the full name of the game was, but it's a Penn and Teller game, where it's basically, you have to drive from...
3850000	3852000	Smokey mirrors from, oh, oh, yeah.
3852000	3864000	So you have to drive, um, this bus, basically, that keeps veering slightly to the right, and, um, for, and it's the actual time that it takes to drive between these two cities.
3864000	3874000	So people do it just as kind of a punishment for themselves and also to raise charities, so, um, yeah, it looks like Desert Bus and VR, it's way prettier.
3874000	3889000	The game was created as a bit of a statement, and I'll let y'all go listen to Bobby's show, he gets more into it, I'm not gonna repeat it, um, but I think it's, it's a very tongue-in-cheek sort of statement, which Penn and Teller do, like, a lot.
3889000	3893000	You may remember they had that TV show, you know, that whole thing, that's kind of their thing.
3893000	3896000	Yeah, it's from driving, I guess it's, yeah, they'll simulate driving from Tucson to Las Vegas.
3896000	3897000	Yes.
3897000	3898000	In real time, without brakes.
3898000	3903000	Yes, which, I mean, the drive from here to Las Vegas is bad enough, I can't even fucking imagine Tucson to Vegas.
3903000	3905000	Oof.
3905000	3909000	But it's cool, though, I don't know what, if they have, like, other features in there.
3909000	3910000	Oh, the VR one?
3910000	3911000	Yeah.
3911000	3917000	Yeah, you can be a passenger now, and you can, uh, you can sit in, as a passenger, and you can, like, throw spitwads at the driver.
3917000	3918000	And that's it.
3918000	3919000	Why?
3920000	3925000	Loki, you're asking a question about why does this game even exist in the first place. Why not?
3925000	3932000	Also, something about, uh, the NPR interview-style interview that you can listen to on the radio.
3932000	3937000	The drones on and on, and they talk very quietly like they do on the radio.
3937000	3938000	That's awesome.
3938000	3939000	Yeah, exactly.
3939000	3946000	All right, well, uh, I know you have a little bit more news, but I think this is a good time for us to take a trip down memory lane.
3946000	3948000	Are you ready, Dark Sakura, to unveil?
3948000	3949000	I reckon.
3949000	3953000	It might be a short show, but we still got plenty of time to talk about classic games.
3953000	3954000	Yes.
3954000	3956000	We always have a minute to talk about classic games.
3956000	3964000	Every week, Dark Sakura jumps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, hey, this game is worthy of your attention.
3964000	3966000	It's the Classic Game of the Week.
3966000	3967000	Yup.
3967000	3968000	Dark Sakura, what is it?
3968000	3970000	R-Type Delta, I chose.
3970000	3978000	Because I've already done R-Type, but R-Type Delta, believe it or not, is kind of a hard-to-get-your-hands-on bit of a game, and it is the-
3978000	3986000	That is not R-Type Delta, by the way. That is the, I keep forgetting to put the video ad blocker in Chrome, which I switched to here in the studio. Sorry about that.
3986000	3987000	Oh, Rob.
3987000	3989000	Here's R-Type Delta.
3989000	3996000	Anyway, R-Type Delta is the fourth of the R-Type games, and the first one to use 3D.
3996000	4005000	It came out for PlayStation in 1999, and it's generally considered a really, really good game in the R-Type series.
4005000	4009000	A friend of ours just gave us a copy.
4009000	4011000	So, hey.
4011000	4022000	R-Type Delta also offers different ships that you can pilot, and every one of the ships has-
4022000	4038000	You can get your force, which is like your big shield slash extra gun, and you get a dose gauge, which every time it hits 100, you can use the delta attack, which is a super attack.
4038000	4045000	So you start off with the R-9A Delta, which is based off of the original R-9 from R-Type.
4045000	4052000	You have the RX Albatross that has wings, and it uses the tentacle force.
4052000	4065000	R-13 Cerberus, which is a red and black one, and it has an energy ribbon that can attack, and then the POW armor, which you unlock after beating the game in medium or hard mode.
4065000	4072000	It was generally, you know, like I said, it was well received.
4072000	4079000	A lot of people even thought it was better than the original R-Type, although to me that's really, really hard to match.
4079000	4086000	And it's basically considered one of these shooters you have to have if you have a PlayStation.
4086000	4095000	For being in a PlayStation game, the polys are pretty nice, it's very complex, it looks really good.
4095000	4105000	Apart from just being super fun to play, although some people found that it was a little bit more difficult than it needed to be, but your mileage may vary.
4105000	4113000	And as far as I am aware, there has been no other release of R-Type Delta, so good luck finding it.
4113000	4117000	And that's it, R-Type Delta for PlayStation.
4117000	4131000	I forgot they made this on PlayStation, but I like how it has kind of the better backgrounds in this, and just kind of like the solid black you remember from the, you know, TurboGrafx and other versions of this that existed, or other R-Types that were out there.
4131000	4137000	I will say, you know, R-Type is still, I like the original R-Type better than this.
4137000	4140000	But this is really freaking good.
4140000	4145000	I like it better than Super R-Type, I like it better than R-Type too, so there you go.
4145000	4151000	Alright, R-Type Delta, your classic game of the week, here at Orange Lounge Radio.
4151000	4154000	I think you just have a couple quickies left, right, Loki?
4154000	4156000	Yeah, a few more things, so we can...
4156000	4158000	Let me get quick, sorry, not to interrupt you, but you did it to me earlier.
4158000	4163000	We will also start to open up the Skype line, I think is a good time to do that if you do want to give us a call and say hello tonight.
4164000	4166000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
4166000	4168000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
4168000	4171000	The Skype line is open while Loki touches on these last few things here.
4171000	4175000	Yeah, I want to clarify because I was also kind of confused about, you know, DayZ and PUBG.
4175000	4180000	So PUBG was actually the one that they said it was going to be originally running in 60 FPS, and now it's 30 across all platforms.
4180000	4183000	That's kind of disappointing because PUBG is more popular.
4183000	4188000	I have no idea what frame rate it runs on for DayZ, but at least it's coming to consoles, so that's kind of cool.
4189000	4192000	Alright, so other things we can talk about.
4192000	4198000	So there's this cool new skin that's going to be coming out for the PlayStation 4 called the PlayStation 4 Legacy Theme.
4198000	4205000	It's based off of the PlayStation 2 dashboard, and you can check it out for $2.99, and it looks pretty awesome.
4205000	4212000	So they have that developed by, I guess, Truett Pixel who does some of these animated backgrounds.
4212000	4218000	And they really did capture quite a bit of the PlayStation 2 dashboard feel, so check that out.
4218000	4223000	Also, on PlayStation Plus, you're going to be getting some games for December.
4223000	4228000	And with those, Darksiders 2, the definitive edition.
4228000	4232000	Kung Fu Panda Showdown of Legendary Legends on PlayStation 4.
4232000	4237000	And then PlayStation 3, Siberia Collection and X-Play's Lost Memories.
4238000	4244000	And then for the Vita, Forma.8, which is a cross-buy with PlayStation 4 and Wanted Corp.
4246000	4255000	And finally, we have Fireaxis announcing an expansion for Civ 6, which is Rise and Fall.
4255000	4263000	And, yeah, it looks interesting. Launching February 8th, it's going to, I guess, focus on the great ages.
4263000	4270000	And introduce, I guess, a concept where your empire can go through a dark period.
4270000	4273000	And they have a new city-based loyalty system.
4273000	4277000	Oh, kind of like 2017 when your civilization goes through a dark period.
4277000	4278000	Sadly, yes.
4278000	4279000	Yeah, okay, I get that.
4279000	4280000	I don't know.
4280000	4283000	I wonder if that was planned that way.
4283000	4287000	That's a pretty clever move. I bet these things are planned years in advance.
4287000	4291000	I think they have a different idea of what a dark age is.
4291000	4294000	I know, but I can't. Jamie, am I right? You can't help but notice that.
4294000	4300000	Isn't it ironic that a game about a dark period for a civilization comes out right after 2017?
4300000	4302000	A little too ironic.
4302000	4303000	Don't you think?
4303000	4306000	And then last but not least, I wanted to mention that there's this awesome mod out there.
4306000	4313000	So, if you're a fan of those battle royale games, well, there's a game that you may have played a while back called
4313000	4319000	Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is now getting modded to have a battle royale type gameplay in it.
4319000	4325000	So, GTA San Andreas PUBG is, I guess it's a new mod.
4325000	4331000	This one allows you to actually kind of play the whole battle royale thing in Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.
4331000	4339000	So, they're seeing right now, at the moment, they are working on, there are about 200 to 400 players on various mod servers.
4339000	4347000	And then they're seeing that they have, I guess, quite a bit of people interested in these types of mods.
4347000	4350000	So, it looked kind of cool, but San Andreas is certainly looking dated.
4350000	4354000	I would like something like this in maybe Grand Theft Auto 5.
4354000	4357000	Well, they have something like that in Grand Theft Auto 5 online, but yeah.
4357000	4361000	It's neat. I like mods in Grand Theft Auto, so why not?
4361000	4365000	Why not? I just saw a call come in that went away.
4365000	4369000	OrangeLaunchRadio, all one word on Skype if you want to get in here.
4369000	4372000	Oh, there it is. Let's take this call.
4372000	4374000	Hi, you're on OrangeLaunchRadio. Who's this?
4375000	4376000	Hi, this is Raginator.
4376000	4378000	Hey, Raginator. Don't forget to turn the...
4378000	4379000	Hi, this is Raginator.
4379000	4383000	Sorry, my computer was freezing out for a second.
4383000	4386000	That's all right. You should know this by now. No, that's fine. What's up?
4386000	4391000	Yeah, I just have a quick question that I'd like to post to everyone.
4391000	4395000	Then I'll free up the line just in case anyone else wants to call.
4395000	4396000	Yeah, sure.
4396000	4405000	All right. Well, not so much on this show too much, but as everyone remembers,
4405000	4413000	you used to host Hoard House for a while before that show went on permanent hiatus,
4413000	4419000	and towards the end of the run, you focus on all games that happen to be online.
4419000	4420000	Yep.
4420000	4429000	Now, I would like to pose a question on this show since Hoard House is no longer around.
4429000	4441000	Is there any online series of games, either completely online,
4441000	4448000	or the focus of the community has been more generally online?
4448000	4461000	Let's say, for example, Call of Duty, where Call of Duty does have both single-player and multiplayer,
4461000	4463000	but everyone likes to play online.
4463000	4464000	Sure.
4464000	4475000	Now, is there any series that the three of you really, really enjoyed playing online that has essentially died out,
4475000	4486000	and there has been no entries into the series for a number of years that you want to see a revival in?
4486000	4493000	Well, I'm going to take the easy answer that I think Loki would say. Probably Final Fantasy XI.
4493000	4496000	I mean, there still is a community in XI. I think many of it moved.
4496000	4500000	Much of it moved to Final Fantasy XIV, even though they are different types of games,
4500000	4505000	but I know XI is looking to reinvent itself in a mobile type of way, which is interesting to me.
4505000	4508000	I have concerns about that, but that was supposed to happen.
4508000	4511000	They announced that a couple years ago. We haven't really seen anything.
4511000	4515000	Granted, it takes time to develop that stuff, so whatever, but I'm very curious to see what happens there.
4515000	4518000	Left Square Enix announced something that takes multiple years to develop.
4518000	4521000	Yeah, so that's why I'm kind of like, all right, I shouldn't really be surprised about this,
4521000	4524000	but yeah, you know, because that was a game that I did spend.
4524000	4527000	You know, Loki, especially, a lot of you may forget,
4527000	4530000	because I know not all of you have been listening to Orange Lawns Radio for 15 years,
4530000	4534000	but we've been doing this show for 15 years, and the first year was in a house,
4534000	4539000	but then Loki and I became roommates for years two through maybe five or so,
4539000	4542000	I don't remember, two through four, two through five, of this show,
4542000	4547000	and we spent a lot of those nights, when we weren't doing OLR, playing Final Fantasy XI.
4547000	4550000	Loki was in one chair playing him, and I'm playing, you know, and so, you know,
4550000	4554000	and I made some great online friends through that whole experience.
4554000	4557000	You know, I'm probably friends with Shane, who you hear a lot on this show,
4557000	4561000	because of Final Fantasy XI. We played that a lot, and you know, other people do,
4561000	4567000	so I know that wasn't a craze that Jamie got in on as bad.
4567000	4570000	I think she, like, tried it for a little bit, but, right, you played,
4570000	4573000	I remember you played XI, but you got really annoyed at all the,
4574000	4575000	Heal, please. Heal, please.
4577000	4581000	Well, it's just because I would throw my macro for people to come for healing.
4581000	4582000	And then they never do it.
4582000	4583000	Because they're stupid bitches.
4583000	4585000	That would involve people reading and listening to direction.
4585000	4586000	Let them die.
4588000	4591000	I believe it was Marie Antoinette who said, let them eat cake,
4591000	4594000	and I believe it was Jamie Summers who said, let them die.
4597000	4601000	Alright, anyway, so yeah, I guess my easy answer is Final Fantasy XI.
4601000	4602000	Do you have an answer for that, Loki?
4603000	4604000	I miss-
4604000	4606000	Grand Theft Auto IV, because you were good at it.
4606000	4610000	I do miss Grand Theft Auto IV only, because I like the style of how they set up,
4610000	4611000	like, the death matches and that.
4611000	4615000	Grand Theft Auto V, it is a more open game, and I think there's a lot of,
4615000	4618000	you know, advantages to that, because you can do a lot of different gameplay,
4618000	4622000	but I do miss, like, the arena style death matches, where it's just,
4622000	4625000	it's a set map, the weapons are in a set position,
4625000	4630000	it's just getting good at that map instead of just it being everywhere,
4630000	4632000	and fucking crazy, so I don't know.
4633000	4634000	Jamie, do you have an answer for this?
4635000	4638000	I thought of a second answer, and I bet you would totally cosign this.
4638000	4639000	Go ahead.
4640000	4641000	Fantasy Star Online.
4641000	4642000	Yes.
4642000	4643000	That, I miss that a lot.
4643000	4644000	Me too.
4644000	4645000	I know a lot of people miss that.
4645000	4649000	And Blue Burst was on PC, and, you know, it literally died, you know,
4649000	4653000	because they pulled the plug on it, but the game does live on, I guess,
4653000	4656000	maybe private servers, but I haven't looked into how to join one of those in a long time.
4656000	4659000	Can you really play Fantasy Star Online anymore, in any form?
4659000	4660000	In any form?
4660000	4661000	On Fantasy Star Online 2.
4662000	4663000	Which isn't even here, so.
4663000	4664000	But it's fully translated.
4664000	4665000	Yeah, I guess that's true.
4666000	4668000	And they don't care if you play on the Japanese servers.
4668000	4669000	Oh, really?
4669000	4670000	Yeah.
4670000	4671000	Oh, I thought they had issues with that at first.
4671000	4673000	No, I've had an account for an age I just haven't played in a while.
4673000	4674000	I need to just fucking play that already.
4674000	4682000	But I need to re-up my Final Fantasy, not Final Fantasy, but my WoW.
4682000	4683000	World of Warcraft?
4683000	4684000	Yeah.
4684000	4685000	Yeah.
4685000	4687000	You have to do that raid with me, because it's fun.
4687000	4688000	What raid? The new one?
4688000	4689000	No, no, no, no.
4689000	4692000	The one that was, um...
4692000	4695000	Crap, what was the name of the character Jennifer Hale voiced in it?
4695000	4699000	The queen elf lady, night elf lady, or whatever.
4699000	4700000	Uh...
4700000	4701000	Uh...
4701000	4702000	God damn it.
4702000	4703000	Yeah, but it was...
4703000	4706000	She's a character and hears the storm, too, and I can't think of it.
4706000	4707000	Yeah, it starts with an E.
4707000	4708000	Okay.
4708000	4709000	But that...
4709000	4710000	A loon?
4710000	4711000	No.
4711000	4712000	But the Gul'dan fight, and that's pretty fun.
4712000	4713000	Okay.
4713000	4714000	Anyway.
4714000	4715000	Alright, yeah.
4715000	4719000	I haven't done Endgame and WoW in years, so it'll be interesting.
4719000	4720000	Alright.
4720000	4723000	Well, Rageinator, I'm gonna turn the tables on ya.
4723000	4725000	Is there an online game that you miss?
4725000	4727000	Oh, yeah, definitely.
4727000	4728000	Um...
4728000	4736000	At least during the PlayStation 2 era, and to a certain extent, the PlayStation 3 era,
4736000	4741000	I used to love the Jesus out of the Soulcom series.
4741000	4742000	Uh, I...
4742000	4749000	You know, the Soulcom games and, of course, Final Fantasy XI, I used to play like no other,
4749000	4751000	but I really, really enjoy it.
4751000	4756000	If I had to pick between those two games, you know, I would...
4756000	4757000	You know...
4757000	4758000	You know...
4758000	4765000	You know, well, Soulcom's a series, whereas XI's just a single entry, but, you know,
4765000	4770000	I would probably pick the Soulcom over anything.
4770000	4779000	You know, unfortunately, Sony kind of threw up the proverbial white flag with the Soulcom series.
4779000	4787000	You know, because unfortunately, you know, well, you know, Soulcom 4 was the final game of the series,
4787000	4796000	and unfortunately, it was poorly timed, because, you know, that was launched right when the PSN outage happened.
4796000	4806000	So they lost a lot of sales because of that, and not only that, but Soulcom 4 tried to emulate the Call of Duty games,
4806000	4808000	which were hugely...
4808000	4819000	Well, still are, but hugely popular, and because of that, you know, the game kind of lost its uniqueness,
4820000	4833000	where previous entries had, you know, but if they stuck to, you know, their roots with the Soulcom series,
4833000	4841000	you know, pure Soulcom, you know, have plenty of maps, you know, new ones, classic ones,
4841000	4851000	and released it on console, obviously, because Sony makes consoles, and maybe even put, like, a PC port on Steam or whatever.
4851000	4863000	I would definitely, you know, buy it, and if need be, if it doesn't come with a PC, then I would seriously consider getting a console and just play Soulcom again.
4864000	4871000	You know, unfortunately, the older Soulcom games are no longer online anymore, they took down servers, so...
4871000	4874000	They always do that, yep. That's exactly what's behind your question.
4874000	4880000	Hey, Jamie, by the way, I just got a text from Alan, while Rachael was talking there. Tyranda?
4880000	4883000	No, it was, um...
4883000	4884000	Azshara?
4884000	4892000	No, it's none of them. She was introduced in that comic about the... fuck, what kind of elves were they?
4892000	4893000	It's fine.
4893000	4894000	I'll look it up, hold on.
4894000	4900000	Alright, you know what, we need, you need to get, we need to, if there wasn't an 8 hour time difference, we need to get Raven and EJ on the line stat,
4900000	4904000	because they would know this answer like that. Our pals from Girls Gone Wild.
4904000	4907000	Alright, anyway, Rachael, I'm gonna let you go so we can get some more calls, but that was a good question.
4907000	4908000	Elison.
4908000	4910000	Thanks, there it is, Elison. Alright.
4910000	4912000	Alright, have a nice night. Take care.
4912000	4913000	You too, bye.
4913000	4918000	Alright, OrangeLountRadio, all one word if you want to get on the show tonight, some other answers from chat.
4918000	4923000	AkumaJP says, I miss goofing around in home. That's a good answer.
4923000	4928000	Uh, let's see, SSG100Matt says, I thought Jamie was gonna say MapleStory, but I guess you can still play it.
4928000	4932000	Why don't, would Neopets be a valid answer to the question?
4932000	4934000	Hi, you're on OrangeLountRadio, who's this?
4934000	4936000	Hey, hey, it's Rama.
4936000	4939000	Hey, Rama, I swear to God, if you have a link, I ain't clickin' it.
4939000	4943000	I actually called to apologize about that, I didn't even know he was gonna react that way.
4943000	4946000	It was disgusting!
4946000	4951000	I just have it over on Twitter, and it was right there, I was just like, oh that's what he meant.
4951000	4953000	You know I'm just giving you shit, what's on your mind tonight?
4953000	4956000	I know you are, I know you are.
4956000	4958000	You know me, what's on your mind tonight?
4958000	4962000	A couple of things, number one, I finally got myself an Xbox One.
4962000	4969000	Oh, congrats, did you do the Xbox One X, or did you kind of take the opportunity to get a cheap Xbox One S?
4969000	4975000	I got the Xbox One S because, as powerful as X is, to me it'd be a waste of money,
4975000	4981000	because I wouldn't play the console enough to appreciate what it can do, plus my TV's about ten years old.
4981000	4987000	Yeah, exactly, if you don't have the top of the line TV to go to the top of the line Xbox, not quite gonna be a match.
4987000	4993000	Somethin' like that, and I don't play games as much as I used to.
4993000	5000000	My Xbox One, I'm gonna be playing three or four games on it, and streaming a lot of anime and Netflix and Hulu.
5000000	5006000	Speaking of anime, I'm glad you reminded me, because I did this whole Ingress thing this weekend, I totally forgot to mention,
5006000	5011000	the other thing they announced, is that there is going to be an Ingress anime.
5011000	5015000	Yeah, they showed a four second clip of an Ingress anime.
5015000	5016000	Four second.
5016000	5022000	Four second, but again, the game is very big in Japan, so I'm not, you know, they have the vending machines and shit over there,
5022000	5026000	so I'm not completely surprised to hear that, but I think that's really cool.
5026000	5031000	That does sound like a great thing, but I just, I wonder now who's gonna pick up the rice to it,
5031000	5038000	and I have a feeling it might be Viz, because Viz is right there in San Francisco, so.
5038000	5048000	Very true, and it will fill the void left by the Tron anime that only lasted one season on Disney XD, so.
5049000	5050000	Yeah.
5052000	5057000	Bobby Blackwolf says, maybe they should make an anime based on Pokemon Go. I see what you did there.
5059000	5061000	I won't play, son, I won't play.
5061000	5068000	Well, maybe they kinda did, because with all this renewed interest in Pokemon, thanks in part to Pokemon Go,
5068000	5074000	they kinda went back and they kinda redid the origin story of Pokemon. I don't know what the fuck else to call it.
5074000	5079000	What else do you call Pikachu, I choose you? That's basically like a retelling of the origin story, right?
5079000	5086000	Yeah, but you also gotta remember, the movies aren't canon to the TV series, so the movies can run in its own little universe.
5086000	5087000	That's a good point.
5087000	5094000	And let's not forget, when Pikachu spoke for the very first time, everybody lost their proverbial shit.
5094000	5098000	What the fuck, are you printing your own anime over there? What was that?
5098000	5101000	I'm printing the script to my porn, Rob.
5104000	5108000	If you're going to cop an ad, I'm gonna cut out your cameo appearance.
5110000	5111000	I'm sorry, sir.
5112000	5113000	Alright.
5113000	5120000	Yeah, I know, SD100matt in chat says, dot matrix printer. I know, it sounds like he's running the fucking print shop, printing a banner over there.
5120000	5122000	Okay, strong bad.
5122000	5138000	But, I mean, it's an Epson inkjet printer, and I'm just like, you know what, I'm tired of buying Christmas labels and stuff for one and two bucks and losing them, so I'm gonna go out, I'm gonna buy some labels, buy some ink, make fancy labels, and print them myself.
5138000	5148000	There you go, fancy. I wanna find, can I, can you find a copy of, like, the print shop, like, so you can actually make labels that look like they were made in the print shop? Can you do that?
5148000	5150000	Yes, is there a Staples near you?
5151000	5153000	Oh, I'm sure there is, like 5,000 of them.
5153000	5160000	Go to Staples, go to the 999 rack, you will find print shop, a version from a year prior for, like, ten bucks.
5160000	5168000	Okay, I'm gonna find that, cause I wanna see, well, I mean, I don't want a new, but I don't want it to look new, I want it to look like I printed it in 1986.
5168000	5171000	And if you wanna be fancy, there's always Print Master Gold, so.
5171000	5191000	Oh, fancy. Uh, let's see, also, uh, s2100matt in chat is kinda reminding me that maybe I should forgive you for the link thing, because you did send me Stroopwafel, and I think, Matt, you should hire Matt as your lawyer, because I, I think I will have to forgive you, because you did send Stroopwafel, so you are forgiven this time.
5191000	5193000	Oh, thank you, good sir, thank you, thank you.
5193000	5196000	Alright, my friend, I'm gonna let you go, but thanks for calling.
5196000	5197000	No problem, dude.
5197000	5198000	Alright, bye.
5198000	5201000	No, they still sell dot matrix printers that are actually USB.
5201000	5202000	Really?
5202000	5205000	You can get one, they have one, I was looking at eBay here, uh.
5205000	5207000	There's part of me that's like, why would I ever do that?
5207000	5213000	An Okie Microline 490 dot matrix 24 pin USB printer.
5213000	5216000	Did they change the enlightenment logo?
5216000	5219000	Like this eyeball thing.
5219000	5222000	The green, little, kinda like.
5222000	5223000	With the eyeball.
5223000	5226000	The, you're talking about the swirly with the triangle in the middle?
5226000	5228000	I'm talking about the triangle one, I'm talking about this one with an eyeball.
5228000	5229000	Can you show me?
5229000	5231000	Yeah, give me a second, I'll link it to you.
5231000	5233000	Ok, alright, I thought you were just gonna flip your thing around.
5233000	5236000	Alright, um, I have a few stories here.
5236000	5239000	I can probably squeeze in one more call at Orange Lounge Radio.
5239000	5241000	Yes, that has always been the enlightened logo.
5241000	5243000	That's not the glyph, but that's the logo for the team.
5243000	5244000	Ok.
5244000	5245000	Yeah.
5245000	5246000	I just always knew about the triangle.
5246000	5253000	Right, because in the game, the glyph for enlightenment is, you draw like a half circle and there's a triangle.
5253000	5255000	But to be fair, Resistance also has this problem.
5255000	5258000	I call the Resistance glyph a four, because it kinda looks like the number four.
5258000	5260000	Oh yeah, that's how I always remember it.
5260000	5263000	And then, but the actual, their logo looks like a key.
5263000	5264000	Looks like a blue key.
5264000	5265000	Yeah.
5265000	5266000	Yeah.
5266000	5267000	So, anyway.
5267000	5270000	There you go, another Ingress fucking derailment on this program.
5270000	5271000	We should start counting how many of those there are.
5271000	5272000	Alright.
5272000	5275000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
5275000	5279000	If you can squeeze in here while I redo these last couple stories here.
5279000	5282000	I had a couple of the quick things I wanted to point out here.
5282000	5289000	Apparently some graphic novels on the way for games like Wolfenstein, Tekken, and The Evil Within.
5289000	5295000	I hope they're as awesome as the FX9 novels from the 80s about Blaster Master and Simon's Quest.
5295000	5298000	Oh wait, but these are graphic novels, so I guess they'll be a little different.
5298000	5300000	They'll be nothing but pictures.
5300000	5306000	So, Wolfenstein Volume 1 is a prequel to Wolfenstein 2, The New Colossus, which I kinda laugh at that because I go,
5306000	5312000	well, wouldn't Wolfenstein 1 be the prequels, but I guess it doesn't work like that.
5312000	5319000	Tekken Blood Feud is coming out for the Tekken franchise, and The Evil Within, The Interlude.
5319000	5325000	So, you can check that out if you're a fan of The Evil Within, which you may have forgot that the sequel was released last month.
5325000	5328000	Or, no, we're in December now, two months ago.
5328000	5333000	There is a Life is Strange bonus episode coming for Before the Storm,
5333000	5340000	and what's notable about this is that Ashley Burch will be returning to the role as Chloe Price's voice actress,
5340000	5345000	because the strike, she didn't reprise the role in Before the Storm,
5345000	5350000	but she will be doing this for a bonus episode, which I think is, that's pretty cool.
5350000	5355000	Square Enix kinda said, you know, Rihanna DeVri, I hope I said that right,
5355000	5358000	who was the replacement voice actress in the time being,
5358000	5362000	she did a fantastic job in the motion capture, we're thankful to her, blah blah blah,
5362000	5365000	but we're gonna do Chloe.
5365000	5370000	Oh, I guess Rihanna will still do the voice, excuse me, the motion capture,
5370000	5375000	but the voice will go back to the original actress, so that's kinda neat.
5375000	5376000	So you can check that out.
5376000	5385000	And lastly, did you know that a certain video game turned 45 years old this past week?
5385000	5387000	It was Pong.
5387000	5391000	That's right, Pong Day was celebrated this past week.
5391000	5397000	45 years ago, Pong came into the world, and Atari decided to declare the day Pong Day.
5397000	5400000	I don't know what authority Atari has to declare anything right now,
5400000	5407000	but sure, we'll roll with that, because obviously Pong was so important for where video games are at today.
5407000	5411000	But I just wanted to remind you that Pong is now 45 years old,
5411000	5416000	and you know what that means, you are also old.
5416000	5417000	And on that note-
5417000	5418000	But I'm not older than Pong.
5418000	5424000	That's right, but some of our listeners out there might be older than Pong, and that's okay if you are.
5424000	5426000	We love all our listeners. So there you go.
5426000	5432000	Alright, that's gonna wrap it up for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio,
5432000	5433000	because no other calls are coming in on Skype.
5433000	5436000	I mentioned at the top of the show it's gonna be a shorter show tonight.
5436000	5437000	We'll be back in seven days, though.
5437000	5439000	I was gonna mention what's coming out this week.
5439000	5440000	Oh, dude, we never got to release dates, did we?
5440000	5441000	No, we didn't.
5441000	5443000	I just figured there wasn't a lot. Sure, go ahead.
5443000	5444000	So there is actually quite a bit coming out.
5444000	5451000	So we've got seven The Days Long Gone on PC, Xenoblade Chronicles 2.
5451000	5454000	Actually, I'm sorry, that was Friday last week, my mistake.
5454000	5460000	Okay, so this week we have Dead Rising 4, Frank's Big Package on PlayStation 4.

5497000	5502000	And I guess technically, although this would be like a Saturday release or something,
5502000	5506000	LocoRoco 2 remaster on PlayStation 4, that's it.
5506000	5508000	In the UK on December...
5508000	5512000	Oh, sorry, because of PSX is this coming weekend, that's why you have a Saturday release.
5512000	5514000	Oh, sorry, just want to throw that out there.
5514000	5517000	In the UK on December 5th, we have Dead Rising 4, Frank's Big Package,
5517000	5520000	and on the 6th, Vostok, Inc. for Switch.
5520000	5524000	All right, and I don't have the Japanese dates up, sorry,
5524000	5526000	I was not prepared for the assignment, so...
5526000	5528000	You are not prepared.
5528000	5533000	That's right, so good stuff coming out in Japan this week, good stuff.
5533000	5537000	All right, that is going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
5537000	5540000	I want to thank you guys for listening, we'll be back in seven days
5540000	5543000	for something a little closer to two and a half, maybe three hours.
5543000	5547000	As we get into the holiday period, we still have to figure out what we're going to do for OLR
5547000	5551000	celebrating the holidays, because I don't think we're going to do a show on New Year's Eve.
5551000	5554000	Christmas Eve, not likely either, so we'll figure something out,
5554000	5556000	maybe we'll tape something in advance.
5556000	5559000	But only a few more weeks until the end of the year, if you can believe it.
5559000	5562000	And we get to open the time capsule. Aren't you guys excited?
5562000	5563000	Oh my god.
5563000	5566000	Did we put more shit in there?
5566000	5569000	No, it's really old stuff from June.
5569000	5570000	From June.
5570000	5577000	So we have to, though, with the new year, we'll have to put stuff right from the start of the year.
5577000	5581000	Oh yeah, no. The OLR time capsule will return in 2018, for sure.
5581000	5584000	Yes, in the Darth Vader piggy bank.
5584000	5587000	Which I will be painting pink.
5587000	5592000	No, because pink is really an unfortunate color, even though that's my hair color.
5592000	5594000	I don't give a shit.
5594000	5595000	Oh, you know what's funny?
5595000	5596000	What?
5596000	5598000	I hate the color pink, but what color is my hair?
5598000	5599000	Pink.
5599000	5600000	Right.
5602000	5604000	Ergo, she hates her hair.
5604000	5610000	No, I think it looks good on my head, but I hate it as clothing colors.
5611000	5612000	Okay.
5613000	5616000	What's it say about me? I like pink as a clothing color.
5616000	5619000	I'm also trying to go for, like, more of a dusty rose color.
5619000	5621000	Also, I fucking love my shirt today.
5621000	5622000	Yeah, Murder She-Ra.
5622000	5623000	Yeah, it's-
5623000	5624000	Angelo Lansbury.
5624000	5628000	It's a shirt that says Murder She-Ra with Angela Lansbury posed as She-Ra.
5628000	5634000	Or if you are a listener of the RuPaul podcast, that would be Murder She-Dunge sat down in She-Ra.
5634000	5636000	So there it is.
5636000	5639000	Anyway, where were we? Oh yes, getting out of here.
5639000	5642000	What happened to baby JJ?
5642000	5648000	What happened was we were about to end the show, and then a commercial for Squatty Potty started.
5648000	5649000	All right.
5651000	5652000	What?
5652000	5654000	That's it. Y'all are getting Squatty Potties.
5654000	5655000	No.
5655000	5656000	I have one.
5656000	5659000	No, they have to pay for advertising. I swear I'm gonna go back and bleep that.
5659000	5662000	They want to get on this podcast, they have to pay for it like they do everywhere else.
5662000	5665000	I have one, but it's not a real Squatty Potty.
5665000	5666000	Uh-oh.
5666000	5667000	It's a naughty Squatty Potty.
5667000	5668000	That's a naughty Squatty Potty.
5668000	5670000	That's what we need to advertise as the competitor.
5670000	5671000	Yep.
5671000	5672000	All right, anyway.
5672000	5674000	Sit down and shit.
5674000	5679000	No, no, no. Instead of the Squatty Potty, it's the City Shitty.
5683000	5686000	We want to thank you guys for listening to Orange Lounge Radio tonight,
5686000	5689000	and if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio...
5690000	5691000	Okay.
5692000	5693000	Great.
5693000	5694000	Great.
5694000	5695000	That's great.
5695000	5696000	Good job.
5696000	5698000	Once you pop, that's great.
5699000	5701000	Good job, the cheat. Have a trophy.
5701000	5702000	Good job.
5703000	5705000	So if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio,
5705000	5707000	tell a friend of five about the show,
5707000	5711000	and help us spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,
5711000	5714000	but if the voices aren't here, then that's less great.
5714000	5716000	So get more people here.
5716000	5720000	Advertise for us is basically what we're asking, because we don't ask for money.
5720000	5724000	But we do ask for your five-star reviews on places like iTunes, Google Play,
5724000	5726000	wherever it is that you found this particular podcast,
5726000	5730000	because we're pretty much anywhere you can find podcasts except Stitcher,
5730000	5733000	and if you want to know why, you'll have to go back in the archives.
5734000	5736000	That's going to do it for another episode of the show.
5736000	5739000	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
5739000	5742000	Dark Sakura, do I need the FU music for your final thought?
5742000	5743000	Not really.
5743000	5744000	Okay.
5744000	5747000	To stupid little man babies on Twitter, guess what?
5747000	5750000	You're wrong, and I'm right, and you're blocked.
5751000	5753000	All I can think of is that GIF of Alyssa Edwards going,
5753000	5755000	you're about to get blocked.
5758000	5760000	Did you make a big tongue pop when you hit the block button?
5760000	5762000	I did, and you know what's funny?
5762000	5765000	Is that he follows like three people, and you're one of them.
5765000	5767000	Apparently, you're following him.
5767000	5769000	Yeah, I follow like 1,300 people on Twitter.
5769000	5770000	Wherever.
5770000	5773000	If I figure you're not a robot, I probably follow you back.
5773000	5775000	I'm a little more choosy.
5775000	5779000	But there are lots of really awesome people out there,
5779000	5781000	and all of you people, you're not garbage.
5781000	5784000	So, well done not being garbage.
5784000	5785000	A plus.
5785000	5788000	Number two, to my little sister.
5788000	5789000	Uh-oh.
5790000	5794000	Don't fucking tell a podcaster not to come for you.
5794000	5796000	That's all.
5796000	5799000	Are you going to come for her and cut her wigs up at night?
5801000	5802000	All right, we'll just end there.
5802000	5803000	You know what?
5803000	5804000	No, no, no, here's what I'm going to say.
5804000	5807000	I don't have to come to her because she's already fucked up her own life.
5807000	5808000	Ooh!
5810000	5812000	Do not allow dark soccer to drag you ever.
5812000	5814000	All right, my final thought.
5814000	5815000	I'll go next.
5815000	5818000	My final thought is I've probably walked 50,000 steps this weekend,
5818000	5821000	but I had a really good time meeting people
5821000	5823000	and seeing people I don't get to see often enough.
5823000	5825000	And yeah, we'll have to do this again.
5825000	5828000	Niantic, hurry up and announce anomaly schedule for next year
5828000	5830000	and try to make this sit.
5830000	5834000	Please put something on the West Coast for quarter one.
5835000	5837000	Because I already have a busy.
5837000	5839000	Or if you're going to put it in Atlanta or something,
5839000	5842000	try to plan it the week I'm already planning on going.
5842000	5844000	That's all I ask.
5844000	5846000	Loki, your final thought.
5846000	5852000	My final thought is that I really need to finish my Lego mock that I was working on.
5852000	5854000	Stupid triangular tables.
5854000	5857000	Like the building I was designing or based on,
5857000	5859000	they have tables inside of it.
5859000	5862000	They're shaped like, I guess, like a triangle.
5862000	5864000	And Legos don't do triangles very well.
5864000	5865000	No, they don't.
5865000	5866000	And it's been bothering the hell out of me.
5866000	5870000	So I finally compromised to making them not triangles,
5870000	5873000	but it's still taking me forever.
5873000	5875000	I've been stuck on this stupid thing.
5875000	5877000	All right, that's going to do it for tonight.
5877000	5879000	Thank you guys so much for listening to our show tonight,
5879000	5882000	and we'll see you in seven days, as will Mr. Smush.
5882000	5886000	Won't you, Mr. Smush, if Mr. Smush can get away from grooming himself?
5886000	5887000	Have a good night, everybody.
