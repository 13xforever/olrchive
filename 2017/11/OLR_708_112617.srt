Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
This week Bungie gets caught with its hand in the cookie jar by displaying one set of experience points earned but granting another.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
They reportedly disabled this behavior but imply it could be back to changes.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
There's plenty more news and it all starts right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
November the 26th of 2017 with episode number 708 of our show.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Joining you live over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Myself, Rob Roberts, also known as Skie on Twitter with my co-hosts say hello over there to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Why do they always want the fish that I don't have?

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Who may or may not be addicted to a certain cell phone game we're going to talk about later.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Don't you judge me.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
How was your fundraiser last week? We missed you.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It went really well. We managed to donate a little over $300 to the Sacramento AIDS Foundation.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
That's great.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And played bingo and gave away lots of fabulous prizes.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
There you go. Fabulous prizes? Shoot, I should have canceled on the show too.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It was for a good cause and a lot of people can benefit from the work that we did.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I totally said last week if she's going to miss a show, raising money for charity is a pretty good excuse.

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So there you go.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And it is that season and I hope everybody here in the States, if you are listening to us here, I hope you had a great Thanksgiving.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And I know this goes down cheesy, but we are really thankful that you guys, some of you tune in live on Sunday nights at vognetwork.com

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
and participate in our chat room, which I'll plug more thoroughly in a minute here.

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Some of you participate with our podcast stuff.

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Some of you have been doing this stuff for years and I have no idea that you're out there

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
because we never hear from you on Twitter or email or any of that stuff.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
We want to hear from you.

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Well, yeah, we would love to, but at the same time-

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Come forward, stalkers.

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I respect the internet anxiety of not wanting to say hello because I've been there too.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So no worries.

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:24,000
But I do want to say thank you for supporting the show because this show did not run for 15 years on, you know, nothing.

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It ran on kitty kisses and sheet cakes.

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
That feedback is very important.

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Yes, kitty kisses, now that we have over there, officially his name is, because many of you have been asking since last week's show,

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Mr. Smoosh is our new kitty's name.

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So, and by the way, in true 2017, what do you call it? I'm not millennial. I'm not Gen X.

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's Shellennial. What is the new one?

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
No, it's Zennial.

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Zennial, okay.

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
With an X.

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
In true Zennial fashion, I have set up an Instagram account for Mr. Smoosh, which you can follow.

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And it is at Mr. Smoosh.

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I haven't even done that for Midna yet, although she has a Tumblr.

47
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You have to spell it out, M-I-S-T-E-R, Smoosh.

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I have one for Midna, a Tumblr.

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Do you know one of the first people that followed Mr. Smoosh on Instagram?

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Hm.

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
TR's dogs.

52
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Hobbit dogs?

53
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Yeah, the Hobbit dogs.

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Alright.

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Anyway, I have to say hello over there, of course, to Tech Master Loki.

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Hello.

57
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Hi, Loki, how are you?

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm doing okay.

59
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Have you set up Instagram accounts for your cats?

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,000
No, because Facebook wants me to set up an Instagram account for myself, and I'm like, fuck off, I don't want to do this.

61
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And then, like, I get friend requests on Instagram, and it's like, oh, you got some friends that want to follow you on Instagram?

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I don't have a fucking Instagram account, stop trying to tell me I do.

63
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Like, I purposely shut this off, and you put it back on.

64
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
We made one for you out of convenience, don't you want to Instagram?

65
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Don't you want to follow Mr. Smoosh on Instagram, you heartless beast?

66
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm sure it'll do it anyways, whether I want to or not.

67
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I know, I'm just waiting to see the whole, don't you want Mr. Smoosh to get a Facebook?

68
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's like, Mr. Smoosh is a cat. They're not allowed to have Facebooks. Anyway.

69
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
About time I got a horse mackerel.

70
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Todd, you and this Animal Crossing thing.

71
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Alright, we're definitely going to talk about the Animal Crossing mobile game.

72
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I do want to get into our kickoff topic, which will be about that, actually.

73
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:21,000
But first, I do want to acknowledge our chat room over at live.voggenetwork.com, because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network.

74
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
voggenetwork.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

75
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
My cat had a live journal.

76
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Did your cat? That's right, your cat did have a live journal.

77
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It still technically does, because I don't think I ever did anything with it.

78
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Well now it's owned by the Russians.

79
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Yes.

80
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
But that's, you know. Alright, looking in chat, let's see, Tiger Claw in chat says,

81
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So I heard you went to PetSmart, did they have any Black Friday deals, say on kitty litter and such?

82
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Actually, no. Here's the thing, we went to PetSmart because we just, you know, we've only had Mr. Smoosh for a week.

83
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So there's still some supplies, and I notice Alan really spoils this cat.

84
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I mean, we spoiled Sanrio and Maruko when they were here too, but we really spoiled this cat.

85
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And we, is he smooshing your hand? That's why we call him Mr. Smoosh, Starks, Ira.

86
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Okay, it's not just the face, but the hand.

87
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Anyway, so we went to PetSmart and we were trying to get, I don't even remember, oh yeah.

88
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Oh, we had to get a, we had to get a litter box with big walls on it because Mr. Smoosh really likes to kick litter.

89
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And it was all over the floor in the old litter box. We had to get a litter box with high walls.

90
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And I was actually kind of looking around like, oh, I wonder what's on sale because it's Black Friday.

91
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I don't think a single damn thing was on sale, but does a store like PetSmart need to have sales? Like.

92
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I can give him Midna's taco costume.

93
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You will starve before you let your pet starve. That's the way a lot of people, not everybody, but most people are like that.

94
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Most pet owners I know would let themselves starve before they would let their pet starve.

95
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And I would just, you know, they're going to, they're going to always buy the pet essentials.

96
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
What you will notice, Mr. Smoosh, we bought a purple sparkly bow tie.

97
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
So that would be the special that we bought. We bought him a purple sparkly bow tie.

98
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
And he actually let us put it on him and he kept it on. It's so adorable. Anyway.

99
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Enough about cats. Let's talk about video games.

100
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Actually, something a little more important than both those things, actually.

101
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I wanted to address this at the top of the show.

102
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And since I know you all are tech savvy enough to subscribe to podcasts and you probably use social media one form or another,

103
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm sure you've all heard about this by now, but I do want to stress this whole net neutrality thing. Okay?

104
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,000
So if you haven't heard, well, and to be fair, we have listeners that live in other countries.

105
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
So maybe they haven't heard.

106
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So they're trying to backtrack on what's called net neutrality laws here in the States.

107
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And I'm going to really like grossly oversimplify things.

108
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
But basically we had a law that was signed into effect a few years ago that basically says

109
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
internet providers cannot discriminate and treat some traffic different than others.

110
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:06,000
A great example before this law was in, AT&T would not let you use FaceTime on the iPhone

111
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:13,000
unless you paid for like a more souped up type of plan because my assumption is that AT&T saw this as competition.

112
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Well, what ended up happening is that all these other knockoff video chat apps really took off and people were using Skype and stuff.

113
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:27,000
And then net neutrality laws came into place and AT&T couldn't do that anymore because they couldn't charge more or less than one thing for another.

114
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:34,000
And so what's happening now is that our current administration, the current FCC chief has basically promised...

115
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You mean Sir Shithead?

116
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Well, I try not to get political on this show, but honestly this net neutrality thing is something that I see people on both sides

117
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
understand why we have net neutrality and why it would be bad that it went away.

118
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
So I kind of feel like this is kind of okay.

119
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
As a person who lives on the internet, I think this is pretty clear cut and dry.

120
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:04,000
From one element, I understand in a way what Comcast, at least what they're trying to say is the reason for this.

121
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Comcast is trying to say what they're trying to stop happening is basically illegal traffic.

122
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
They want to be able to stop BitTorrent.

123
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:19,000
To be fair, I get that. I'm not going to defend piracy of Game of Thrones and shit like that.

124
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
That part of it I'm not going to defend.

125
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
BitTorrent isn't illegal traffic. BitTorrent is a client.

126
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Bingo. Bingo. And here's where we get into...

127
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Let's just block all web browsers.

128
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And that's where I get into, I don't know if I trust Comcast.

129
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I don't know if I trust anyone to do this right.

130
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Because what is going to be the algorithm that shows if something is illegal or not?

131
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And let me tell you, having this podcast that we do here at Orange Lounge Radio

132
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
and having the Voice Geeks Network, vognetwork.com,

133
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,000
we've been doing this show for over 15 years and nobody takes us seriously still.

134
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Which, you know, it's fine. Whatever. We're hobbyists.

135
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I gave up on the prospect of getting famous from this a long time ago and that's fine.

136
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
We have a small family here that we love and adore and that's awesome.

137
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:11,000
But the reason why I say that is that let's say that internet radio is deemed a form of piracy.

138
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Well, who's to say that they're not going to suddenly block VOG Network or something like that?

139
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And what if there's these broad strokes?

140
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Oh, there's this giant download of an MP3.

141
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It must be the new Taylor Swift album and these things start getting blocked.

142
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
And you might think I'm being a little bit crazy here,

143
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,000
but I think the precedent is there with what happens on YouTube and their automated algorithms

144
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
is you see shit that shouldn't be getting blocked all of the time.

145
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And I understand that YouTube...

146
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Well, just this week, whole channels were deleted.

147
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Yeah.

148
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
For sure. For sure.

149
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Konan's channel was deleted.

150
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I want to say there were some other big YouTubers.

151
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
There's a ton of channels just like, boop, gone.

152
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,000
So anyhow, the long story short, if this whole net neutrality repeal happens,

153
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
it's not going to be pretty.

154
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I do think some of the graphics you see out there on the internet

155
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,000
where ISPs would charge $5 for Facebook and $5 for gaming and all that stuff,

156
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I don't know, I'm a little bit apprehensive as to if that would really happen to that degree.

157
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
But, hold on before you get out your pitchforks,

158
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:33,000
but this whole thing with the loot boxes we've been talking about ad nauseum on the show for the past couple weeks

159
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
has just gone to show that companies in it for profit,

160
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
be it video game companies or cable companies,

161
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
they'll dip their big toe in the water trying to nickel and dime you.

162
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
And if that works, they'll put their foot in the water trying to nickel and dime you,

163
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
and then they'll put their leg in, and then they'll put the whole waste...

164
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You know what I'm getting at here?

165
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
We might go back to this whole AT&T just kind of does the FaceTime thing first,

166
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
and then kind of see what happens there.

167
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Or, oh, we're only going to block Bittorrent.

168
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
But that means that independent games that are free, that are distributed via Bittorrent,

169
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
are also going to get impacted.

170
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And then where is that going to lead to?

171
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It's going to lead to another file transfer service that someone's going to make.

172
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I mean, it's just like how they want to basically say,

173
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
listen, we want to write to be able to throttle stuff,

174
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
but don't worry, we're not going to throttle anything. Trust us.

175
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
If you don't want to throttle anybody,

176
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:31,000
then why are you fighting and paying so much money to politicians to throttle stuff?

177
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:38,000
History has shown us that in terms of money-making facilities for profit companies,

178
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
they will murder to get their bottom line.

179
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I mean, you want to look just even as far back as 100 years ago.

180
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You know, look at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire.

181
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Look at the molasses flood.

182
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I mean, we've got history on our side that shows that companies will pretty reasonably,

183
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
once you give them an inch, they will take a mile.

184
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And Bobby Blackwolf in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

185
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
The only reason it can happen here is because we don't exactly have regional competition for ISPs,

186
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
so the free market can't work it out. Exactly.

187
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Comcast is the only option here.

188
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I had a guy come to the door, just not even within the past week, going,

189
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Oh, hey, we're trying to be a competitor to Comcast in this area,

190
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
and we wanted to know if you'd be interested in switching.

191
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
We got some great deals.

192
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
And I was like, I was actually into it for some like,

193
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Oh, great, Comcast has a competitor.

194
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Well, tell me about your internet packages.

195
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
And he's like, Oh, well, actually, we only compete with them with television.

196
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
We don't have a high speed internet service yet.

197
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And I'm like, God damn it, that's the one thing I was willing to let.

198
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I don't give a shit about TV anymore.

199
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It's like Comcast or AT&T, and it's like AT&T are high speed six megabits.

200
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
But I would be, you know what?

201
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I would be willing to go to high speed six megabits, which means backwards, a big step,

202
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
to have open internet.

203
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
But it won't be.

204
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I know it won't. I know it won't.

205
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:06,000
And again, to fully kind of go with what I'm going with here with what Bobby said,

206
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
you know, he's right.

207
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
In most areas, Comcast is your only option, or whatever the provider is in your area,

208
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
is the only option.

209
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And here's my thing.

210
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Does Comcast believe enough in this that it's willing to split itself up

211
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
so that we can have competition so that the free market can regulate itself?

212
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Because I bet the answer to that is no.

213
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
No, they already have agreed.

214
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Trying to get bigger.

215
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Yeah, they're letting them get bigger with different things.

216
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I mean, they've taken back a lot of different regulations that were in place to stop these monopolies.

217
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It's all, he's basically, as they would put it, the FCC is a compromise agency, basically.

218
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
So it's under control now by these big companies.

219
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
So obviously, anything that they're doing, he's getting a big payout at the end somehow.

220
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
So anyway, and what does this have to do with games?

221
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Because I'll tell you what.

222
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,000
If there was ever something that is a premium Xbox Live, PlayStation Network, Nintendo Network,

223
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
those are going to be the first things up for an additional fee.

224
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Those would be the first things as a gamer.

225
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
What does this mean to you if you're not in the U.S.?

226
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Well, you know what?

227
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000
A lot of the content you guys consume, including this particular show, a lot of it comes from the U.S.

228
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,000
So absolutely, this could have a trickle effect on what happens in other countries as well.

229
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
So anyhow, I know...

230
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Communications needs to be, I mean, maybe not with the current administration,

231
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,000
but I strongly feel that there needs to be, that instead of privatizing it, it needs to be...

232
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Crap, what's the word I was thinking of?

233
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Brought under, I would probably say even just government agency.

234
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Well, that's I think what they're doing now.

235
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,000
They're trying to bring it under the FTC, but I don't think that they have enough manpower to be able to regulate all that.

236
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Well, honestly enough, I believe that our country itself is too big to govern properly, but that's a whole other...

237
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
A whole other Oprah.

238
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Anyway, which by the way, did you know Oprah had a podcast?

239
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I didn't learn that until this week and I was like...

240
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Must not have been very good.

241
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Actually, she had an interview with Joe Biden that was really good.

242
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
You know what? We've been doing this longer than Oprah, okay?

243
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
That is true. We have been podcasting longer than Oprah, but I did...

244
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I'm not going to lie to you. I did have that moment of, well, if Oprah is podcasting now, should I just quit?

245
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I'm not going to lie to you. I'm like, if Oprah is here, I mean, that's it.

246
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Anyway, okay, so all these jokes aside and things, it is a serious thing.

247
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Again, I think most of you that are tech savvy enough to listen to podcasts probably already have some awareness that this is going on.

248
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
But I would urge you to take a look at battleforthenet.com for some more information,

249
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
including some actual protests that are going to be happening.

250
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I believe December 7th is the date and they're going to protest actually at some Verizon stores.

251
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
And I think that is something that's definitely going to get a lot of attention, a lot of coverage.

252
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
But you can't just sit there and do nothing. You have to pick up the phone and make some noise.

253
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Form letters aren't going to do a lot. The FCC literally came out and said,

254
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
we disregarded all the comments because they were all form letters. They said that.

255
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
But they didn't even...

256
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I know, I know, but it's out there. So don't rely on form letters.

257
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Call.

258
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You have to pick up the phone, call. You have to go out, be seen, be heard. Don't rely on armchair politics.

259
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Honestly, even if they weren't form letters and they're not, I mean, they're just making excuses.

260
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
They're by law, they have to do that, but they're just like, fuck it, we don't care.

261
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
So participate in your government and don't let them do this.

262
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
And if they do do it, you know, that has to be a reality that we have to face too.

263
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
If this does go through, you have to hold corporations liable, which to tie this back to gaming,

264
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
we're seeing happen a lot now with the loot boxes.

265
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Again, I don't want to repeat that whole shindig from last week too much,

266
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,000
but I think what we've really seen happen is that, you know, EA got hit hard over this Battlefront thing.

267
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And that's kind of why they scaled back.

268
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
And we have some stories coming up on tonight's show where other companies are now starting to,

269
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
oh shit, we better dial this back before we're the next Twitter target.

270
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I only think it's necessary before the next Twitter target is that they see,

271
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
oh shit, countries are starting to look at this as like,

272
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
we better investigate this formally to see if this is gambling and whether we're going to classify it as gambling.

273
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
And they're seeing that their whole source of revenue is going to be just yanked from undering them.

274
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
And if there's one thing we've seen in this gaming industry,

275
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
any time the government threatens to regulate it, they go, oh shit, and regulate itself.

276
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Hence why we have an ESRB in the first place.

277
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
So anyway, we'll come back to that point in a minute.

278
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
But first, on a not so serious topic, let's change to something that is happy news.

279
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I think for everybody. And that is, you know, we've had some game releases these past couple of weeks.

280
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
A lot of the big end of the year titles are starting to come out.

281
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
But one of them that I know many of you have been looking forward to, you Nintendo nerds,

282
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I'm looking at you, is Animal Crossing for mobile devices.

283
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Animal Crossing, I forget the subtitle all of a sudden, Pocket Camper.

284
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Is that the name of it? Animal Crossing Pocket Camper.

285
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Some Pocket Camp.

286
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Pocket Camp finally came out on mobile devices this week.

287
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Jamie, you've been playing a lot of this.

288
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
In fact, I see you tapping your phone.

289
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
You're probably playing it right now.

290
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
So what are your thoughts on Animal Crossing?

291
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
It's cute. I really like it.

292
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
You know, I don't think it could have been much better done than this.

293
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I mean, given the limitations.

294
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
So, yeah, I really like it.

295
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
This lamp is in the wrong place.

296
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I mean, seriously, I've been playing it like I played, you know, old school Animal Crossing.

297
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
So it can't be, you know, too bad.

298
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I've been really happy with it. So.

299
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I think it's OK.

300
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Well, I didn't ask.

301
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I'm a gamer and I'm going to share my opinion anyway.

302
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Here's the thing.

303
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Well, the price is right. It's free.

304
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
So you can't go wrong with free.

305
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I would not buy leave tickets, but that's a personal decision.

306
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
That's fine. That's a personal decision.

307
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I have spent money on Pokemon Go and people have judged me for that.

308
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
So that's plenty fine. You spend money on what you like.

309
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
But I would not spend money on this yourself, at least.

310
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Well, that's what I say today. Who knows what patches might come into the game at a later date.

311
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Right. So I like it in the fact that it looks really nice.

312
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I know that sounds really silly, but like on you know, I have the new iPhone 10 and has that newer screen.

313
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:52,000
And I'm like, wow, the textures on this like they're really like HD and it really kind of pops like, you know, for old school cartoony style, it really does pop.

314
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
So like graphically, it's good.

315
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:01,000
And I like the way that some of the things translate into the touchscreens, like the fishing and the bug catching is so much easier. Right.

316
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:08,000
But I kind of don't like how it feels like it's scenes from an Animal Crossing game.

317
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Like it's like you could go see Les Miserables on Broadway.

318
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
That's playing a real Animal Crossing game.

319
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Or you could listen to the soundtrack that just has like I Dreamed a Dream and the nine other big songs, but kind of skips the rest of it.

320
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
And you can kind of skip around and listen to your favorite songs.

321
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
You can have that. And that's kind of what Animal Crossing Pocket Camp is to me.

322
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
It's like you have these like greatest scenes, but they kind of string together in a really weird way.

323
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Like I, I like the questing system, but I don't really care for how repetitive it feels.

324
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Like I feel there is nothing to do for these little fuckers.

325
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Then get fruit, catch fish, catch bugs, which to be fair was kind of all that the regular Animal Crossing game was as well.

326
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:01,000
But I do feel like at least there was more variety in where you could find items, how you procured things.

327
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
You could kind of make your custom clothes. There just seemed like there was more that you could do.

328
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Is there like more like can you do the custom stuff in this?

329
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
No, at least not that I've seen yet. I haven't seen the mailbox or any of that stuff yet.

330
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
So like I said, it's greatest hits. Some of the stuff is kind of cut, but then you have some other stuff that's kind of like interesting.

331
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
See, that's the problem that I have. I've always had Animal Crossing.

332
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
It's like you take the first one, which is just like this amazing thing.

333
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Right.

334
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
They had like the NES games and all that cool stuff in there and all the custom stuff.

335
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
And then each iteration that came out afterwards, it's like we're removing more things from it.

336
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
And then we're getting down to this, which this is free.

337
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
So I guess I can't complain.

338
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Yeah, you're in this weird place where it's like, but it's free. And that's kind of what I come back to as well.

339
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
It's like, well, well, but it's free. So it's not a horrible thing.

340
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
But here's my thing. Here's my number one thing. Let me just get this out.

341
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
My number one thing is, and you know, for the people that love this game, I think even you could agree with me on this.

342
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I would not want this to replace Animal Crossing on consoles.

343
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
And I have a fear it might.

344
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Like everybody's like, when are they going to announce Animal Crossing for the Switch?

345
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
When are they going to announce Animal Crossing for the Switch?

346
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
The Pikmin games are going to put out first.

347
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Here's my thing, guys. Has Nintendo said they're going to make Animal Crossing for the Switch?

348
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I don't believe they have. And if they keep selling leaf tickets on this thing, do they have motivation to make one?

349
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Are people buying leaf tickets on this thing? I mean, Jamie did.

350
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I know other people. I'm not just going to pick on her. I know plenty of people who have.

351
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Some of my other mobile gaming buddies have fessed up to doing it too.

352
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
So, you know.

353
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I did get into the quarry and I did it to buy more storage space.

354
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,000
And it does, I will admit, I have been enticed because you can craft more than one thing at one time.

355
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
If you spend those tickets.

356
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I have the three crafting things too.

357
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:52,000
So there are things to do. But again, I can't sit here and be like, oh, Jamie, you're so dumb for buying leaf tickets.

358
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
And then I sit here and spend money to get a hundred Pokeballs and Pokemon Go.

359
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Like I just, I can't, I don't have the fucking conscience to do that. I can't do it.

360
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
So like she buys the things she likes. I buy the things I like.

361
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Right. And I'm not saying it's terrible. I'm just, you know, it's fine. This is a free mobile game.

362
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
So you're just wondering if that's really the position Nintendo is going to be in.

363
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
People really are, because the people are spending a ton of money on this.

364
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:24,000
But then, yeah, I could see that this would be more profitable for them because they're making money constantly.

365
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I am sad that Super Mario Run canceled all Mario console games.

366
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Well, I actually, you say that tongue in cheek, but my understanding is Nintendo believes that game to have underperformed.

367
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
So it wouldn't cancel Mario games anyway.

368
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:51,000
And at the same time, Mario's in this weird universe where like multiple Mario games exist simultaneously on the same console.

369
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:59,000
What I mean by that is you had Mario 3D World and Mario Maker, both like full fleshed games on the Wii U.

370
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:05,000
And Super Mario Run is a unique niche. It's a weird, the whole like nonstop running thing.

371
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
It's a weird niche and one I didn't particularly care for ultimately.

372
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:20,000
But I think Nintendo like really purposefully wanted to not make a new Super Mario Brothers Wii type of Mario game or new Super Mario Brothers 3DS, whatever.

373
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:27,000
They didn't want to make that game on mobiles. They wanted, they actually did something to make this very different.

374
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:37,000
But Animal Crossing, it doesn't feel that different. It just feels skipped around. Like I said, like a greatest hits album.

375
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:43,000
That's the only thing. I think greatest hits albums are good. I like to listen to Abba Gold.

376
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Unless they edit them like that Samantha Fox album.

377
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I like to listen to Abba Gold sometimes. But you know, sometimes I need that deep cut. Sometimes I need to hear Happy New Year.

378
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Okay, and that was non-Abba Gold. So sometimes you have to get the deep cuts. Anyway.

379
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:07,000
SSG100Matt points out, there is a KK Slider doing I Dreamed a Dream. Of course there is. Of course there is.

380
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:13,000
And then Act F points out, I know Pokemon won't be released ever again. Only Pokemon Go.

381
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Act F says Nintendo is doing this to promote their games. It's not to replace the original.

382
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Well I hope you're right because I do think the Switch would be a great platform for Animal Crossing.

383
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:31,000
But I don't want it to be the same Animal Crossing rehashed again. I do hope they really try to.

384
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I mean if this Animal Crossing Pocket Camper is kind of like the love letter to the old school Animal Crossing games.

385
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Then great. Fine. It's a greatest hits album. It's a nice little send off.

386
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
But I would really like to see Animal Crossing on the Switch kind of bring some new features.

387
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:53,000
And I'm not talking about like a mall. Like I would like to see them do more with the online.

388
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I would love to see the arcade games come back. I know it's never going to be the NES games.

389
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,000
But it's not like Nintendo doesn't know how to make mini games. You know, they could make unique to Animal Crossing games.

390
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I would like to see more of the exploration stuff. Like how you used to be able to go to the island.

391
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I think it would be really cool if there were other ways you could visit other types of atmospheres.

392
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Maybe more traveling and maybe that could be the theme of the next Animal Crossing game is that you travel around the world or something.

393
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
And maybe something where there's like different cultures and different towns and things like that.

394
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,000
But the tongue in cheek thing is that the cultures wouldn't necessarily have to reflect the cultures IRL.

395
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:36,000
You could go to like the penguin land and you could go to where all those bitch sheep live and so forth.

396
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Bitch sheep land. And you could you could all the sheep are bitches. You could bury all the.

397
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Have you met Barbara? She's a bitch. You could bury Ed up to his neck.

398
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,000
And I don't know how the horned dynastids poke him.

399
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:57,000
They just need to send Barbara into the upside down to be eaten by a Demogorgon.

400
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,000
You know what? Why not put the upside down in Animal Crossing? Maybe something kind of neat could happen.

401
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I would like a sick twist like that. Animal Crossing survival horror. I'm down.

402
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Come on, dark soccer. See now the thing, the pitfalls. Now they have a purpose because they send you to the upside down to survival horror.

403
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:20,000
And remember the dream village and there was the murder mystery dream village like called Aika town.

404
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:27,000
No, I don't. Oh, oh, yeah. Remember? Yes. Yes. And you'd find like the broken dolls and like the weird story it would tell.

405
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Yes. I still have a save for Aika village. It was pretty crazy.

406
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,000
As long as Barbara is the first to die. She's going to be she's going to be the new. I almost said a spoiler. I can't say it.

407
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:43,000
All right. Some people still haven't watched Stranger Things. Cat butt scrooches.

408
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Anyway, Robert M in chat says, since the mobile game autosaves is Mr. Resetti involved.

409
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Now, I don't believe he's in this mobile game at all.

410
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,000
So that's that's one of those B sides that got overlooked on the greatest hits album is Mr. Resetti.

411
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,000
But who knows? They might they might patch stuff in. Who knows? You know, again, I don't hate Animal Crossing.

412
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,000
It's free. I just I'm not motivated to spend money, but she is.

413
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,000
So maybe Nintendo is doing something right. And I'm sure it's more of you out there spending money on it, too.

414
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:19,000
So there you go. Animal Crossing. Oh, I want to check our discord as well, because I know I like to post little plugs in our discord.

415
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
And if you want to join our discord server, I highly recommend you do.

416
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Just go to vognetwork.com slash discord and you can join the discord for the voice geeks network.

417
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,000
vognetwork.com. Again, that's vognetwork.com slash discord.

418
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
JD in chat says, I'm mostly enjoying Animal Crossing Pocket Camp.

419
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
It definitely has that freemium flavor, but I haven't felt pressured to buy anything.

420
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I've kind of settled into a play 30 minutes every three hours routine.

421
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
That's from JD on Discord. Dartitsuya says, I only play a little bit of it.

422
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I just have to figure out where to get the friend code stuff started.

423
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Oh, and actually JD kind of answers this, too, but I'll answer it here.

424
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:02,000
You I mean, I see people posting their screen caps of friend codes everywhere, and that's great.

425
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
But just just link it to Facebook and Twitter if you have them.

426
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:12,000
And that's how I found everybody. Just go to Facebook on Twitter and then just add everybody that way.

427
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
So it does have those links in there. You don't even ever need the friend code.

428
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:21,000
And then I found people that I had no idea played these games that were playing it thanks to Facebook.

429
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:30,000
The one little thing I wish it would do is that it never tells you again who the person is after the first time you add them.

430
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Like I'll be able to see like Jamie Summers on Facebook is here as Sakura.

431
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,000
You know, I'll be able to see that. But if I forget that she's Sakura, like I'll never remember that that was Jamie's character.

432
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
If it doesn't like because never tells you after you initially add them.

433
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
That's the one kind of bummer thing that I hope they hope they fix.

434
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
But I believe that was the case in Nami Tomo and all that stuff, too.

435
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
So JD points out if someone else adds you, it doesn't tell you who they are.

436
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
No, it doesn't, does it? No, it's only when you add them that you know who they are.

437
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
So there are there are some imperfections there.

438
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,000
But Nintendo online, I don't expect them to ever get that right.

439
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
JD says, I got a friend request from pumpkin.

440
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
And I don't know if it's someone I know or some rando who encountered me in their game.

441
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,000
It's not me. I know I'm a prime suspect with all things pumpkin, but it's not me.

442
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I'll give you that. Anyhow.

443
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
All right. Let's move on. We got other gaming things we want to talk about tonight.

444
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Let's first, though, get into our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

445
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

446
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:41,000
I played Dragon Age Inquisition. I played Mass Effect Andromeda for a little bit.

447
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I cannot stop looking at this cat.

448
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Mr. Smoosh is going to ruin this show.

449
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Smooshles. Smooshles.

450
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
And I say that because we always get distracted by Mr. Smoosh.

451
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Mr. Smoosh may be the biggest case yet for the show going to video,

452
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
because I always said, like, I don't know if it would be fun to put us on cam,

453
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
but we could put Mr. Smoosh on cam and then everybody would watch.

454
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Yep. Cat cam.

455
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Yeah.

456
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
We call it the smoosh cam.

457
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,000
But I've been playing some Itomo. I'm playing idle pouring.

458
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I think I'm on my third rebirth now. Third or fourth. I don't know.

459
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
I don't even know what that means. I kind of stopped. Sorry.

460
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
After, like, you played it once.

461
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I played it once a week.

462
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Once.

463
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Once across a week and then I was done.

464
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Whatever.

465
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:34,000
And, of course, I'm playing Pokemon Go and Animal Crossing.

466
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Click, click, click, click, click, click. Animal Crossing.

467
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
No Ed. Thank God. No Ed.

468
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
We got Super Mario Galaxy.

469
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
And so Dan's been mostly playing it. I have played some.

470
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
We broke out four player arms.

471
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Wait, wait, wait. Mario Galaxy on the Wii?

472
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Odyssey. Sorry.

473
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Oh, Odyssey. It's hard to keep them all straight.

474
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Whatever. It's Mario something or the other.

475
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Yeah.

476
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
With the giant. Okay. So I have to bring this up.

477
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
You know how, like, your hat guy lives in hat town?

478
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Mm hmm.

479
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
It made me remember the series that was on Pinwheel.

480
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Do you remember Pinwheel?

481
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Like that used to come out like 6 a.m. on Nickelodeon?

482
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Right.

483
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Hell yeah.

484
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Pinwheel. Pinwheel. Spin me around.

485
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:23,000
And one of the little British shows that it showed in there was the Hat Village. Remember that?

486
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Kind of.

487
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
When I went and looked it up, it was fucking called the, like, Hattytown Adventures.

488
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:34,000
And the main hat was a sombrero named Sancho.

489
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
This is like from 1979 or something.

490
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,000
My brain, like, kind of combined Pinwheel and Today's Special. I keep thinking they're the same show.

491
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Today's Special was fun.

492
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Wasn't Today's Special Canadian?

493
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
It was. It was a set in a department store.

494
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Everything on Nickelodeon in the early 80s was Canadian.

495
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
And the lady was a mannequin.

496
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Everything.

497
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
The lady was a mannequin. Remember?

498
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Yes.

499
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Anyway. And the puppet security guard.

500
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Yes. I'm really going to be intimidated by a damn puppet with some fucking pasta mustache.

501
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Whatever.

502
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Well, anyway, but it's just that whole game gave me flashbacks to Hattytown Village.

503
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Or Hattytown Avengers or whatever the fuck it was called.

504
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
So, especially the Bobby hat. That's what it made me think of.

505
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Because the constable in the town was called Bobby and he was a constable hat.

506
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Anyway.

507
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
There's like two listeners. Everybody else is way too fucking young to understand.

508
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
You children. I had younger siblings and I was forced to watch this shit.

509
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Let us 40-somethings have our moment. Or nearly 40-somethings.

510
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I got the cat's tail. He doesn't care.

511
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
And so.

512
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Because you're helping him lick his ass.

513
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
There you go. There you go. Lick. Lick. Lick. Lick. Lick.

514
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
I do that to Midna too.

515
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:50,000
But we also broke out both of our Joy-Con sets and played ARMS 4 player.

516
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Which was really kind of cool.

517
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,000
And that's kind of it.

518
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Hattytown.

519
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Alright.

520
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Just say Hattytown three times fast.

521
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Hattytown. Hattytown. Hattytown.

522
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
It's kind of funny.

523
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

524
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Well I played League of Marvel Superheroes 2.

525
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
More of that because I'm just trying to unlock all the characters for my kids.

526
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
And.

527
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Let's see what else.

528
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
I bought South Park but I haven't played it yet.

529
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I really. Like I bought it on Playstation 4.

530
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,000
And since my wife hogs the TV I really should have tried it on.

531
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I should have gotten it on PC.

532
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
In hindsight.

533
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
But you know I figured I had pre-ordered it originally on Playstation 4.

534
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
And I got the free copy of South Park The Stick of Truth.

535
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
So I was like I'll just do it again on there.

536
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
But I tried to do the whole.

537
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Like I haven't.

538
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,000
I was doing the Playstation streaming on my old laptop.

539
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Which is pretty old.

540
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
And my new laptop I'm like well shit this should do it way better.

541
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Oh my fucking god.

542
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Their app is a piece of shit.

543
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Like first off apparently there's this issue where there's.

544
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Okay so you start off you load in everything.

545
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
You sign up your account or whatever.

546
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
So I did all that.

547
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
And so I had to factor out the first before the two factor authentication.

548
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
They want me to do a reCAPTCHA.

549
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
And it's like okay click on all the pictures that are a car.

550
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
And keep clicking on them until there are no more cars.

551
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
I will tell you this much.

552
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,000
I was clicking on that fucking picture for 30 fucking minutes.

553
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Because every time the last square had a car picture in it.

554
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I click on it and another fucking car picture did.

555
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
And it kept doing that over and fucking over again.

556
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Until it finally let me in.

557
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,000
And then after all that then it wanted to do two factor authentication on my fucking phone.

558
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
And after all that then it didn't fucking work very well.

559
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
It's like laggy as shit.

560
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
So fuck you Sony your stuff sucks.

561
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:05,000
And apparently this is an issue that anybody that uses the PC app for PlayStation streaming or whatever.

562
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,000
It's been going on for over a year now.

563
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
That they haven't just fixed this shit.

564
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
It's just been fucking broken for a while now.

565
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
So.

566
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I missed the CAPTCHA we had at VOG.

567
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
The whole like play a mini game.

568
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
That thing was awesome.

569
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
The company shut down.

570
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
We didn't want to get rid of it.

571
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,000
We didn't have a problem doing a CAPTCHA because most of the time it's like 5-10 seconds at the most.

572
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
It's just like click on the picture.

573
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Okay done.

574
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
And this shit was just it was broken.

575
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Like you could tell like there'd be stuff like and it was like it's all of them were cars or street signs or pictures of streets.

576
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
It's like okay well here's a picture of a street sign.

577
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Is that still counted as a street?

578
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Because I know it's a picture of a street.

579
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
But you're showing me just the street sign.

580
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Is that line in the background?

581
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Is that a street?

582
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
And so it was just all fucked up.

583
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
And finally I got it to work after 30 minutes wasting the whole night doing this shit.

584
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
And they come to find out it's laggy as fuck.

585
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
I'm just like my internet is fucking great.

586
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
My network is great.

587
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
My wife at the time because it took so long wasn't on Netflix.

588
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:16,000
So there is no reason with gigabit ethernet that I shouldn't be able to stream this shit.

589
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Yet for some reason, nope.

590
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Not gonna fucking happen.

591
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
I just don't know.

592
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
So that wasn't a thing.

593
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:31,000
So yeah I didn't get to really play a whole ton of stuff other than Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2.

594
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I did end up playing more of the stupid cell phone games.

595
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Ironically enough not any Animal Crossing because honestly I was bored of that game after 5 minutes.

596
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Like I played it and I'm like okay this is what this game is gonna be.

597
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
I can't see myself doing this.

598
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I can't see myself just going and gathering stuff to make furniture that I don't give a shit about.

599
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
I can't play this anymore.

600
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
And so that's kind of where that was.

601
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
But yet I'll play this stupid fucking office space clicker game that gets fucking worse.

602
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Everybody has their weakness.

603
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
All the time.

604
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:10,000
It just gets fucking more and more complicated and just like watch more ads bullshit.

605
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
But it's like oh give me more of that.

606
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I can't stop playing that.

607
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,000
And no VR games because once again I just was too lazy to set it up.

608
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
If I'm going to I want to.

609
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:30,000
It's like the other day I was like should I play Lego Marvel Super Heroes or all these VR games I haven't.

610
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
I don't know which VR game I want to play.

611
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I'm just gonna go play Lego Marvel Super Heroes.

612
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
That's how I did it.

613
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
That's it.

614
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Alright.

615
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
My gaming week.

616
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Honestly not a whole lot besides my usual cell phone stuff with with Ingress and Pokemon Go.

617
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Which both of those games are having double experience events going on right now.

618
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,000
And I actually find I'm kind of grinding Pokemon Go a little harder than Ingress.

619
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,000
But Pokemon Go is nice because the Pokemon are kind of everywhere.

620
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Whereas Ingress you have to you know go to specific places.

621
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,000
So Pokemon you can kind of open the app and play at home for a little bit.

622
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
I try to do both.

623
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Obviously I try to do both and you know I will go out on walks and things.

624
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:16,000
And there's you know places near where I work where there's both portals and Pokestops.

625
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
And I will use my little you know Bluetooth device to play both games at the same time.

626
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Now that I have the iPhone 10 I have much better luck playing two games at the same time that way.

627
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
So it does allow me to do that.

628
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,000
But I haven't been particularly motivated to like because I'm in that stage in Ingress where I'm level 15 but not 16.

629
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
And like 16 is as high as you can go.

630
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
It's like the highest you can possibly go.

631
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
It's not like okay I hit level 16 then what.

632
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Like once you hit level what is it now 10 and you can submit your own portals and rate the other portals.

633
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Maybe that's 12 I don't remember.

634
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Well yeah they did the rate thing that was a while ago then they just added where you can submit stuff now.

635
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Yeah once you hit that point it's like well I can do everything I need to do.

636
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:00,000
So the rest of it is just but I mean not to say like you know I still have fun playing the game.

637
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:07,000
And once in a while you know I'll need that Zen moment of leaving the house and making fields in the neighborhood.

638
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Do the batches that you get from the yearly things do those count towards your badge counts on Ingress for levels and stuff.

639
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Yes.

640
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Sweet I'm going to get the level up.

641
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Oh why because you're getting a gold badge and it's like the one thing holding you back.

642
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Platinum or something.

643
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Nice. Yeah yeah.

644
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Oh that's funny.

645
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Alright I'll be 13.

646
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Congrats.

647
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Alright but then Pokemon.

648
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Then Pokemon has the new thing which I know we'll talk about later in the show quickly.

649
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
But you know I yeah that game's still fun and I'm grinding that.

650
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Actually I will say this because I'm what I'm level 35 I think in Pokemon Go.

651
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:51,000
So what I want to do is I do want to hit both level 16 in Ingress and level 40 in Pokemon Go.

652
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:56,000
And then I should get some type of certificate for that for like sickest individual alive right.

653
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Wouldn't I get some type of acknowledgement for like like you have an AR disease.

654
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Congratulations.

655
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Like maybe that'll be a thing.

656
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
So there you go.

657
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
But I have been playing at home.

658
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I've still been playing Heroes of the Storm which I play.

659
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,000
I try to do my daily gold matches every day to get my daily gold.

660
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
I finally threw him money.

661
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:25,000
I finally gave them money just because I've been playing the game so much and I fucking wanted Junkrat.

662
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
So I bought him with real money.

663
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
So there I got suckered into it.

664
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,000
But it was a free game and it's I've played it for many many hours so I don't feel that bad doing it.

665
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,000
And then another game of course I got suckered back into playing I think I talked about this last week.

666
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I started playing World of Warcraft and actually I've been playing it like a lot.

667
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Are you on the regular server.

668
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:54,000
No I am no I went I went somewhere and I rolled just to be somewhere like I'm not playing with anybody.

669
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,000
So because I'll be honest I actually might be re upping.

670
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Oh there you go.

671
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:11,000
It's I don't know like I've been playing and there's there's things I like and I really like what I'm hearing about this next patch they're going to do which is where it's not going to like all the questing is going to scale.

672
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Like that was the best part of the expansion is how the quest in the new zones scaled you remember that and like so it didn't matter which zone you did you just go did what you want.

673
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
They're doing that for all the zones.

674
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
So like.

675
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
That'll be great.

676
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:28,000
You can it's you level 0 to 60 in any classic wow zone.

677
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,000
If you want to go straight to fucking swamp of sorrows and start your new character you can do that.

678
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:38,000
You you're going to have the level scaling and then I think it's 60 to 80.

679
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:45,000
You can do either Northrend or the Burning Crusade content.

680
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
No good nor Northrend that's amazing.

681
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Yeah you could skip one or the other altogether.

682
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,000
For me I really like the music in Northrend so I'd rather just music but I hate the questing.

683
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Yeah so except for the Zandalari and then I think they're combining cataclysm and pandaria.

684
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
I think will be eight which is great because cataclysm fucking blows.

685
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Sorry.

686
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
So well panda isn't much better but those quests are better so I would do those.

687
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
And then yes.

688
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
And then you have the normal world trainer and stuff so I think that's really cool what they're doing.

689
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
But don't get me wrong.

690
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
I'm still a big big fan of Final Fantasy 14.

691
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,000
It's just somehow I've now been suckered into paying for two MMOs.

692
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:24,000
I bought one month of WoW and I thought maybe I could make enough gold to pay for another month.

693
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
We'll see.

694
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:31,000
But playing WoW does make me realize oh these are the things that I kind of like better in Final Fantasy 14.

695
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Like I actually think I like running dungeons better in 14.

696
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:41,000
But then when I play WoW I'm also like but these are the it seems like there's kind of more to do in endgame in WoW than there is in Final Fantasy 14.

697
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
That was the thing that let me lead 14.

698
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
There was just not there was jack shit to do once you were done with the main stuff.

699
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,000
They saw that they added the ability to play songs as a bard now.

700
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Yeah that was something they added in 14.

701
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I haven't really played around with that yet but yeah the whole perform thing where you can like make your own songs.

702
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
That's kind of neat.

703
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:06,000
But you know Final Fantasy 14 kind of needs just a few more things like that and it'll it'll be.

704
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Well I and I will say I think I but this is personal opinion.

705
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
I think the story in 14 is still superior.

706
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Like I think the Heavensward and especially Stormblood like those stories are so fucking good.

707
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Like they're better than just about almost any other game in the Final Fantasy like franchise.

708
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
It's that good.

709
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
So it definitely beats WoW but that's a personal thing.

710
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:37,000
I also know some people that are super gung ho about Blizzard that love the story in World of Warcraft and can't really get into Final Fantasy the same way.

711
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:42,000
And it just goes back to money for Leaf tickets or money for Pokeballs.

712
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
What is what is your preference you know whatever you want to do.

713
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
So anyway that's that's our business.

714
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,000
I'm up to level 67 on my resto druid.

715
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:56,000
I just started what like a week and a half ago is whenever I got back from Seattle about a week and a half ago.

716
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
So I'm making pretty good progress I think.

717
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,000
SSJ100Matt in chat says time to bring out.

718
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Excuse me.

719
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,000
SSJ100Matt in chat says time to bring back courthouse.

720
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
That's funny.

721
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
As far as the other thing goes I'm loving these names for the certificates.

722
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,000
JD in chat suggests you've kept Niantic afloat.

723
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Actf says Niantic still exists because of people like you badge.

724
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:26,000
I forgot to mention there is a huge Ingress event in San Francisco on Saturday.

725
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:35,000
So that's like another thing. So I'm I'm actually legit concerned I might be late to next week's show because of said event.

726
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
So if the show doesn't start at six I apologize.

727
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Or Jamie will just have to figure out what button she's got to push to make it start.

728
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
But Alan will be here to let you guys in.

729
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,000
So no I'm really I'm not thinking that will actually happen but it might.

730
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
So we'll see.

731
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Anyway there we go.

732
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Let's get into some other housekeeping.

733
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:07,000
We're still going to be here for the next few weeks but Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve are both on Sundays.

734
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:14,000
So I highly doubt we're going to have live shows either of those nights because I'm pretty sure I have to do my family stuff on Christmas Eve.

735
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:19,000
And Jamie I know even though you're Jewish dance family you celebrate with them Christmas Eve right?

736
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Kinda.

737
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Yeah so.

738
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,000
We usually just do Christmas Eve stuff and then Christmas Day stuff if I'm not working.

739
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Yeah.

740
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
And I think I'm working.

741
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
So we're probably.

742
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Actually no.

743
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
I may be on leave.

744
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Oh right right. Yeah yeah yeah.

745
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Yeah.

746
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Well regardless. Oh yeah.

747
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:44,000
And by the way we're not going to say too much about it but Jamie's going to be absent from the show for a couple of weeks due to some other stuff.

748
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:49,000
So we're talking about like I think doing maybe an early show on like New Year's.

749
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Maybe New Year's Eve.

750
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,000
A lot of that's going to depend on on her and her schedule.

751
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
OK so we'll let you know.

752
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Right Jamie.

753
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Well and if if anyone who I trust well enough wants to ask me what's going on I'll probably tell you.

754
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Yeah.

755
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
But nothing public.

756
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
It's personal business is all they need.

757
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
And it's not bad.

758
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
And it's not bad.

759
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
It's all they need to know.

760
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
No.

761
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
All right.

762
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Anyway I think that's it for housekeeping.

763
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
I'm just having cybernetic parts put in.

764
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:22,000
She literally is going to be the bionic woman now because I am calling her Jamie Summers since you know the beginning of time.

765
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
So she's getting the implants.

766
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Yep.

767
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
I'm going to get the leg and the arm and the eyes.

768
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
She's going to get a leg just like Rose McGowan.

769
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
And what was that movie where the grand house.

770
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Yes.

771
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Planet Terror.

772
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Yes.

773
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Planet Terror.

774
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
You know I actually saw a really.

775
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Next time Loki's critical and Nintendo.

776
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:47,000
I really I saw the good Halloween costume of an amputee who did that.

777
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Perfect.

778
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Perfect.

779
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Yeah.

780
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
All right.

781
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Let's get into some gaming news Loki.

782
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:05,000
So as we kind of mentioned when we're talking a little bit about the whole net neutrality and loot boxing certain countries and states have kind of weighed in on the whole loot box stuff.

783
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:21,000
So one of the states actually kind of came out and made a comment about it was of course Chris Lee from Hawaii who actually was making an announcement talking about that loot boxes demonstrate predatory behavior and that they want to combat that.

784
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:36,000
And of course you know they're talking about you know basically saying the EA is being very predatory towards people saying that this is like a Star Wars themed online casino designed to lure kids in the spending money.

785
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,000
And it's a trap because that's totally a Star Wars thing to say.

786
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
You have to say it's a trap as a trap.

787
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Thank you Loki.

788
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
You don't look quite like an encephalopod though.

789
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
That's a compliment.

790
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:58,000
I look like a homeless person earlier today and I get shaved.

791
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
But yes.

792
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:09,000
So of course you know they're going to look into that to see what they could do to maybe help you if it comes down to fighting it including blocking a regulation.

793
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Along with that other countries have weighed in Belgium was one that actually they had a kind of a translation from an article saying that you know they saw them as demonstrating while it's not exactly gambling.

794
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:31,000
It does demonstrate a lot of the same things that you would see with gambling having that same kind of appeal as people would to like different gambling games.

795
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,000
France has come out as well against it saying that.

796
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Basically that they're also you know very predatory.

797
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:51,000
One of the things they were talking about was I guess the A.R. J.L. which is a French organization that regulates online gambling.

798
00:49:51,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Basically a letter from French Senator Jerome during basically said that you know they wanted them to look into this because you know.

799
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Since there has been such an advancement of gaming culture basically talking about you know e-sports and microtransactions the blue boxes seeing whether or not that they.

800
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:31,000
These need to be regulated like online gambling because of you know the way that you know people are spending money on this and see he wants to see you kind of like how China's done were more transparency in the drop rates to help players.

801
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:35,000
You make more informed decisions and.

802
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:41,000
You know also just kind of making sure that they're not doing anything shady kind of like online gambling.

803
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Because yeah I mean if they're basically putting this out there in a way that they can kind of skirt around laws because you're buying fake currency to do this.

804
00:50:50,000 --> 00:51:04,000
That's it seems like that they shouldn't be able to get away with that because if you think about it like if I have you know if I'm trying to sell drugs which is obviously illegal but I say no no I'm not really selling drugs.

805
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:12,000
I'm selling this picture that I drew on a piece of paper with a pencil and you're just getting the drugs for free with that drawing that I did.

806
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:19,000
You can't do that it's still illegal you know even though I'm saying oh well I'm not selling the drugs I'm just selling this picture.

807
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Something similar that it's like oh no no we're not spending real money on it you just buy this fake currency that you then spend on the gambling.

808
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
It doesn't work that way.

809
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:40,000
You wouldn't be able to buy like you know California crystals to buy California lottery tickets with if you're underage it's it doesn't work that way.

810
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
So I don't know.

811
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:49,000
I definitely hope they look into this a little more because I'm all for them getting rid of this bullshit.

812
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Do you think it's going to come to that regulation.

813
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Do you think if the gaming industry has a tendency to kind of back down.

814
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:03,000
And I kind of think like I think this backlash that's happened against D.A. other companies have to be noticing it.

815
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Yeah I think that they definitely notice it and it definitely will have an impact on it.

816
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:12,000
But like a lot of the times you know where they say they need this for development you know costs and stuff like that.

817
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Look at EA's direct words what they are talking about.

818
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:21,000
They mentioned to their investors about they're saying that this is going to have no financial impact on them.

819
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,000
You know the fact that they're you know removing these temporarily.

820
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:31,000
So if it's going to have no financial impact on them then why did they need to be there in the first place.

821
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Obviously they make more money so they could do it without it.

822
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,000
It's just they want to do it with it because they're going to make more money.

823
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:42,000
I don't know. I think if they keep pushing it keeps moving in this direction.

824
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Obviously now they kind of took too much of a leap.

825
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:55,000
But if it keeps if they still try to inch it out even further then yeah there's gonna be more backlash with it including you know now that it's gotten mainstream press and stuff.

826
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:00,000
More regulation you know regulatory bodies looking at this type of stuff.

827
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:06,000
I think it is going to come to the point where they're going to have to be transparent about the percentages of drop rates and these things.

828
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:15,000
How about stop being fucking assholes about it and just if you want to sell DLC sell DLC.

829
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
That's fine.

830
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:24,000
But the fact that you have a random loot drop that's fine if it's an in-game thing like Borderlands.

831
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Random loot drops all day long.

832
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:33,000
But that's in-game that's part of the game it's not this like I have to spend money to buy loot boxes.

833
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Which God forbid you know take two.

834
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Well probably we'll see that in Borderlands 3 but you know it's it's not necessary.

835
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:50,000
It's definitely no one's going to look at it and go oh they're not trying to make money off this.

836
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:56,000
I mean obviously they're trying to make money off this and the fact that it's random is so that you're not guaranteed to get what you want in it.

837
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
So that you will spend more money on it.

838
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:03,000
And that's they're not selling a service they're selling just like a lottery which is gambling.

839
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Is it weird to hear lawmakers talking about this.

840
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Do you think they'll get it right.

841
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Because I noticed what's you know something that we kind of have to get used to is that it kind of felt like in the 90s like lawmakers didn't play video games.

842
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
They were in touch with it.

843
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:22,000
But now you know you know 30 and 40 some things we grew up on video games everybody kind of knows what Nintendo is at this point.

844
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
I don't think they'll get it right.

845
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:32,000
And unfortunately for them that's going to work against the gaming industry because the way they're going to perceive it because people say that it's like gambling is they're going to call it an online casino.

846
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Star Wars themed online casino.

847
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
And if that happens then it's done.

848
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Loot boxes are gone.

849
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
I mean that's going to happen.

850
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
They'll be gone from Overwatch too.

851
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Which is going to be because you know again Blizzard seems immune from all this because you know to be fair because it's it's cosmetic.

852
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:58,000
You know and I'm sorry if they get caught in the crossfire with it but you know what Activision Blizzard you're not you're not 100 percent innocent.

853
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
You guys said that.

854
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:11,000
I mean it may not necessarily be as much on the Blizzard side of things but Activision they have their fair share of bullshit that they've been pulling with the loot box stuff so they are equally the blame for this.

855
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:16,000
And I'm sorry if it comes to that we're all loot boxes basically are just gone.

856
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Well you know what you kind of have yourself the blame for it.

857
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:25,000
All right I don't want to rehash the loot box thing too much more unless Jamie you want to add something because you were here last week for the big kickoff topic on that.

858
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:34,000
But if you do want to email us of course you can always continue the conversation if you want it's your show participate at orange launcher dot com if you want to send us an email.

859
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,000
But I will point this out because this is an interesting kind of other side of things.

860
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Now this is a game that was a whole free to play thing that both Loki and I have talked about.

861
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:50,000
God ad nauseum on this show. Yes a little game called Clicker Heroes. Remember when we were all into Clicker Heroes.

862
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Well I didn't know that did you know Clicker Heroes to get in a fucking sequel because of course it is.

863
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Of course it is right. But here's the interesting thing about it. So with Clicker Heroes to play source has decided you know what we're getting rid of the free to play Ruby mechanic.

864
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
We're getting rid of it.

865
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:13,000
And if you don't know what the Ruby mechanic is once in a great while a Ruby will drop that you can click.

866
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:23,000
And then you use the rubies to buy premium stuff. But of course if you want to just buy what is it like 10 rubies for ninety nine cents or whatever it is I don't know the exact ratio you can do that.

867
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:30,000
And that's with the PC version the PlayStation version all the version which makes sense because of the free free game right. It was a free to play game to be fair.

868
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:40,000
What is Mr. Smoosh. What do you do. Oh God. Hold on guys. Mr. Smoosh has one of my free chisel toys from. Yeah. Remember chisel is for the cat.

869
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:47,000
I know things are for the cat. I know but I don't want him to destroy that. That's like a keepsake at this point. OK Mr. Smoosh don't tear that up. OK OK.

870
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Shall I just go into my story. Not yet.

871
00:56:53,000 --> 00:57:03,000
All right. So yeah. So basically instead of going the whole free to play route they're actually going to be you know charging money up front and not having all of that free to play stuff.

872
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:13,000
So they're going to actually charge thirty dollars for the sequel which that's interesting. I'd be curious to see how the game plays.

873
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Yeah. I'm looking at the screenshots and it looks like they tried to take a little more like it looks a little more Diablo esque in the way at least that it looks.

874
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:36,000
But I can't see how the main game mechanics are going to change that much. So we'll see. But what's also interesting about it is they basically said the developer PlaySource kind of says you know we've made a lot of money off of what they call the whales which are you know the free to play mechanics.

875
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:46,000
But they said we don't want this kind of money if it came from anyone who regrets their decision if it made their lives significantly worse as a result.

876
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:54,000
We really don't like making money off players who are in denial of their addiction. And that's what a large part of free to play gaming is all about.

877
00:57:54,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Everyone in the industry seems to rationalize it by shifting the blame assuming way too much cognizance on the part of their victims.

878
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:09,000
So isn't that interesting that they're coming out and basically saying people are addicted to this shit and we don't want to enable it anymore.

879
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:19,000
I can see that. I mean it the clicker games are quite addicting. I I've never been compelled to buy currency though in it. So there's that.

880
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:29,000
But you know I'm willing to pay for their game if it's if it's decent. I can't really tell based on the screenshots but it's fun for a while.

881
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:36,000
I don't know. I mean I I spent ten dollars on the rubies at one point but that was more of a it wasn't that I needed to do it.

882
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:44,000
That was more of a and that's all I ever spent was ten bucks. It was more of a I wanted to pay something to the developers for like all the hours I spent playing the game.

883
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:52,000
I was kind of like you know they deserve a little kickback and sure getting the double gems power up or whatever the fuck I bought right away.

884
00:58:52,000 --> 00:59:03,000
That's a nice little kick too. But that's it. Like I'm only ever going to spend ten dollars on this whereas like seriously don't ask me how much I've spent on Pokemon Go or how much gas I've put in my car because of Ingress like just don't don't ask.

885
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:18,000
I won't tell you. Yeah I mean it's fine. I don't have a problem supporting developers like this and it's good to see that these people even like someone that like it would be very easy for them to just you know keep the same thing and they could defend it with saying listen it's a free play game.

886
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Yeah I mean it's kind of hard to argue that but the fact that they're saying listen now we don't want to kind of we've kind of thought about it and we don't want to be a part of this problem.

887
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:40,000
You know that that's might I guess that's pretty noble of them I guess but I think that maybe they've determined like that the average amount people spent was 30 bucks and probably they probably could make more money.

888
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Well I just I worry for them because well maybe maybe not. I mean if the average was 30 bucks and they sell a lot of copies of it then they'll make the same amount of money. I kind of don't think they will sell. I think 30 bucks for this type of game is going to be a stretch and it's going to be the type of thing that ends up on steam sales.

889
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Yeah I can see picking this up. I think most people will buy it for 10 bucks five the first steam sale opportunity. Yeah but I mean maybe you know again I eventually dropped 10 dollars on clicker heroes so if I drop 10 bucks on this then they made the same money off of me on either game so who knows.

890
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Dungeon buster in chat says I heard about this story pretty bold move but their reasoning was also very interesting.

891
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Bobby Blackwolf asks so serious question how much have you spent on Pokemon go. I there's honestly a part of me that says I don't have to answer this question.

892
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,000
I plead the fifth.

893
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Do we count the devices that I bought like the Pokemon go plus and gotcha.

894
01:00:47,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Although the gotcha was a gift. So do I really count that. I'm probably not easily while this game has been out a year and a half easily two hundred fifty dollars.

895
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:11,000
But how much have I paid for my Final Fantasy 14 subscription in that same time.

896
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Probably about the same. I would say I spend about as much on this game as I do on an MMO subscription and it's it's kind of a similar thing.

897
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:30,000
You know it's interesting though I've spent more money on Pokemon that I have in ingress to which Niantic actually gets the money if that makes sense.

898
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:35,000
I mean because I put gas in my car but Niantic doesn't fucking get anything from that right right.

899
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:49,000
And Niantic. Oh to be honest they don't really sell them. I know I've bought ten dollars. No I think I gave the game twenty dollars to buy the ten dollars worth of capsules and maybe like one set of frackers ever.

900
01:01:49,000 --> 01:02:02,000
But I also bought a very rare kit when I went to their anomaly. So I would say maybe over the four years I played ingress a hundred dollars tops tops on money that Niantic actually gets a part of it.

901
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:12,000
I think I spent maybe like 20 bucks and all of that was from the free Google survey thing where you get money from doing their surveys.

902
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,000
So technically no money but you know.

903
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says I only ask that because you said don't even ask me I didn't think it would work. Well there you don't say I don't do things for listeners.

904
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Rageinator says so multiply by 10 to get the real amount then. No I was I was honest with you. It's about ten dollars probably about ten dollars a month and then you figure it was thirty dollars for the first device about forty dollars the second.

905
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Maybe a little extra money during one of the events I'd say 250 is a fair guesstimate because that game's only been out about a year and a half.

906
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:47,000
So I bet some people have spent more.

907
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:59,000
But see that's the thing is like you know like I don't have a problem with people spending that kind of money on these games because it's not that much when you're talking about the length of time that you've had the game and I can't really wants that food.

908
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Mr. Smudge is being as I'm eating fish cake.

909
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
He probably thinks it's kitty soft food.

910
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:11,000
That's my pop.

911
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Poor Mr. Smudge.

912
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Okay a little bit for you.

913
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Jamie Jamie stuck out hurt like she put just a little tiny piece in her hand to give to Mr. Smudge and like while her hand was out he fucking jumps around it up on the table and sticks his nose.

914
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Okay.

915
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Anyway sorry cats.

916
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:46,000
But anyways yeah so like I don't have a problem people doing that but it's like what's when you try to shapely do that after like you know like E.A. for example when you're trying to you know oh we're going to charge you sixty dollars for the game and we want you to still pay this hundred you know ten dollars a month as well.

917
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
It's like no.

918
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Come on.

919
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:58,000
All right well we'll move on to our soccer if you're able to keep Mr. Smoosh at bay there to get to our next story.

920
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Oh my God.

921
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
I'm I'm eating like this.

922
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
You're distracted.

923
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Go fish.

924
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,000
No.

925
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,000
No.

926
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Do you need me to go put him away.

927
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Poke poke poke.

928
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,000
No I'm just gonna keep poking at his paws.

929
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,000
That's what I do with Midna.

930
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Okay.

931
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:14,000
So basically we have some ass hole ishness.

932
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Basically the developer gazillion who does Marvel heroes.

933
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,000
No.

934
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Gee smooshy.

935
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,000
You're pushy smooshy.

936
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
That's what you are.

937
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Okay I'm gonna put him away if he's too distracted.

938
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,000
No no no.

939
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Okay.

940
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:32,000
So anyway basically everyone at gazillion got laid off.

941
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
They were supposed to get laid off at the end of December.

942
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Well this happened right before Thanksgiving.

943
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,000
If that is not the dick move of dick moves then I don't know.

944
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
I hope they got paid through whenever.

945
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,000
I heard they weren't even getting like PTO cashed out and all sorts of like.

946
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,000
That is bullshit.

947
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,000
We went fucking broke today type of shit.

948
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
That is bullshit.

949
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Yeah.

950
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
It's really unfortunate.

951
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Yeah so anyway a good number of players of the game have already started asking for refunds

952
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:02,000
because it's been less than six months you know and they are well within their rights.

953
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:07,000
So I hope that they can get the money but then again you can't get blood out of a stone

954
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,000
so.

955
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Yeah like if they couldn't even pay their employees PTO like you're not getting money

956
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
without a lawsuit.

957
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Like it's just not going to happen unless they run it up the flagpole and go all the

958
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,000
way to Disney.

959
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:23,000
And if it starts to become an ugly PR thing for Disney who let's not forget owns Marvel

960
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:27,000
if it becomes an ugly PR thing for Disney then maybe something will happen.

961
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Disney doesn't own the developer.

962
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,000
It doesn't matter though.

963
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
They pulled the license.

964
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
I would still have their fault.

965
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,000
It's still it's still an image thing.

966
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:41,000
And you know if if the whole backlash with Star Wars Battlefront 2 is anything just just

967
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:46,000
copying Disney on any all your complaints and I think you might get better traction

968
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
that way.

969
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Well they have the money for it so no one's really worried.

970
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:56,000
They'll just up theme park prices again.

971
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,000
All right.

972
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Well in all seriousness you know that is really unfortunate to those developers and so we're

973
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,000
thinking of the developers and hope that they can find new employment.

974
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:11,000
And it's one of those few times you see the really good side of Twitter is that I did

975
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:15,000
notice there were gaming companies like you know Blizzard and like there were some other

976
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:19,000
companies like right away were like hey if you were impacted by what happened to Gazillion

977
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
we're hiring for these positions right now.

978
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Call us here.

979
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Email us here.

980
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:27,000
So at least there's like yay that's the good part of social networking.

981
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:34,000
So you know we really hope the folks at Gazillion can land face up somewhere that doesn't completely

982
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:38,000
ruin the holiday for every door that closes another opens et cetera et cetera.

983
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Let's hope that that works out.

984
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,000
All right.

985
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Moving on.

986
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Another story Loki.

987
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:49,000
So apparently Bungie has announced that they're changing the way that they're handling Destiny

988
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
2's experience points.

989
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:57,000
And this I guess comes after some players had raised questions about how the system

990
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,000
was rigged.

991
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:05,000
So you know basically like any other game you would earn experience points and you after

992
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:11,000
you get so much XP you level up and then once you get to level 20 which is like a your soft

993
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:18,000
cap they call it then you get a bright Ingram every time your experience bar fills up.

994
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:23,000
And so with that you can buy loot boxes and whatnot.

995
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:29,000
However they I guess had this event called Clarion Call I guess which gave bonus XP to

996
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:35,000
players when when they were joined by at least one of their clan mates.

997
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:40,000
And they were saying that during the event some players noticed that the longer they

998
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:45,000
played the slower they'd progress despite the fact that they were repeating the same

999
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,000
activities.

1000
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:51,000
So the first time player would earn like 5000 XP and then they would see that you know

1001
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:58,000
large chunk of XP bar fill in the second or third 15th time they earned the same number

1002
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:02,000
of XP but the bar would fill even smaller.

1003
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:07,000
So it was like a curve like that the bar was filling like at a curve rate.

1004
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Yeah.

1005
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:13,000
So instead of it being you know where it was supposed to be you know this constant leveling

1006
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:19,000
they were kind of tweaking it a bit to make it so that you earn those bright Ingram's

1007
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:23,000
i.e. loot boxes slower and slower.

1008
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:28,000
If it was just doing that with experience points I would have no problem with it.

1009
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Or it's like the gas meter in my car in reverse where like it doesn't go down like for the

1010
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:37,000
longest time I'll drive around and it's like my gas meter doesn't go down at all and then

1011
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:42,000
all of a sudden I'll be like on a quarter tank and just like runs to empty all of a

1012
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,000
sudden.

1013
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,000
So it's the reverse of that.

1014
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Well I mean I'm glad they are putting a stop to it because that's pretty shady.

1015
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Like how do you even how do you even justify that.

1016
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Yeah.

1017
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:56,000
And their comment was you know we've seen the community discussion around XP gain and

1018
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:00,000
destiny after reviewing our data we agree that the system is not performing the way

1019
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,000
we'd like it to.

1020
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:05,000
In other words you guys notice today we'd like to describe what's going on under the

1021
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:10,000
hood and talk about what you can expect going forward with earning XP and destiny too.

1022
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:15,000
How about just make the bar an accurate representation of percentages.

1023
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Like is that too much to ask.

1024
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Like I'm sorry.

1025
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Do you know how much fucking like corporate speak was just in those words that came out

1026
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:26,000
of your mouth that literally meant like and I'm not blaming you.

1027
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
That literally meant like oh we got caught.

1028
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Oops.

1029
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Well literally the explanation too doesn't make any sense either because it says currently

1030
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:38,000
XP will scale up when playing longer or fixed duration activities like crucible competitive

1031
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:44,000
multiplayer matches or Leviathan raids and says and XP will scale down when playing activities

1032
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:48,000
that can be quickly repeatedly chain like public like grinding public events.

1033
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:52,000
We're not happy with the results and we've heard the same from the community.

1034
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Oh fuck you.

1035
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
We're not happy with the result.

1036
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Oh my God.

1037
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,000
This system is failing us.

1038
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Bullshit.

1039
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
You're unhappy that people notice and complained about it.

1040
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:05,000
And this is why I never got to level 20 because I never had to see any of this stuff.

1041
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
I fooled you.

1042
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,000
It's I'm sorry.

1043
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Like I always like I always get like miffed when they just say oh yes you know we're disappointed

1044
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:19,000
in the way you know we're disappointed in you know the data that we've used.

1045
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Do you fucking program the game.

1046
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
You can't tell me you didn't know what was going on.

1047
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
You had to plan the system out.

1048
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:31,000
So you know full well how the system was working and it's just that oh you got caught.

1049
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:36,000
And so now it's like oh well we're disappointed in ourselves.

1050
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,000
We'll do better next time.

1051
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
No you won't.

1052
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,000
You won't.

1053
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
I'm glad I never played it.

1054
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,000
What's up.

1055
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Destiny 2 is like it's a beautiful game.

1056
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
You know the little bits I have played on PC.

1057
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:52,000
It's a gorgeous game and it is you know for somebody who doesn't even really care for shooters that much.

1058
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,000
It is kind of fun.

1059
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:57,000
But all this endgame bullshit really sounds exhausting.

1060
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Well it just sounds to me that they want people to earn those bright Ingram slower so that you get tempted to buy loot boxes.

1061
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Could be that's what I think it is.

1062
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:13,000
That's how you earn loot boxes in Overwatch is you learn earn them as you gain experience playing matches.

1063
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:20,000
But like Blizzard didn't feel the need to fucking lie on the bar about what percentage you are to a certain level.

1064
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:23,000
It's just so weird to me.

1065
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Like who who thought that was a good idea and that they wouldn't get caught with all this.

1066
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Like hey you know if you play this event you'll get near the full experience you play it again it's going to go down or something like that.

1067
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:36,000
And people are at least are aware of it.

1068
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Well here's a publisher that's been doing something and has not been quote unquote caught until now.

1069
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
But this is a very different type of situation.

1070
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:47,000
This is the one that kind of makes you go wow.

1071
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
And this has to do with the game Axiom Verge.

1072
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:55,000
And it came out this week that the publisher who's Badland Games has been doing something for Tom Happ.

1073
01:11:55,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Who I believe is the creator the like the soul dude behind like these games.

1074
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,000
So anyhow Tom said in a passage here.

1075
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:07,000
I'd like to take a moment to give a special shout out to the publisher Badland.

1076
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
As you may have seen elsewhere on my blog and Twitter.

1077
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
I try to be pretty open about my son's health situation.

1078
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:18,000
In short he was born healthy but the doctors failed to treat a routine case of jaundice during a critical period when he was just days old.

1079
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:22,000
The result was a lifelong condition called connectoris.

1080
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
I may or may not have pronounced that right.

1081
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:30,000
That is characterized by severe neurological damage which robbed my son of how much of much of his motor control and hearing.

1082
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:34,000
The reason I mention this is that after we decide to move forward with Badland Games as the publisher.

1083
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:41,000
They offered to donate 75% of their share to a special fund dedicated to Alistair's ongoing health care costs.

1084
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:48,000
They didn't want to publicize it since none of us wanted to be seen as trying to use my son's suffering as a marketing tool for the game.

1085
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:51,000
I hope this doesn't come across that come off that way.

1086
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:57,000
I just wanted to thank them for their generosity and offering that up since it was definitely something they didn't have to do.

1087
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:02,000
And so a lot of people have kind of gone well I'm gonna buy a second copy after hear about that.

1088
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
So good guy publisher Badland Games.

1089
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Yeah my first game was good.

1090
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Oh yeah that game's great.

1091
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Axiom Verge is great especially if you kind of have that itch with Super Metroid that kind of needs to be scratched.

1092
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:15,000
It's a great great game you definitely should check out.

1093
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:22,000
You know I have to admit though and I don't know if it's just like the internet womp womp part of me or the fact that I've worked in health care for the past few years.

1094
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:27,000
But my first thought was why are the health care companies not paying for this?

1095
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:34,000
And that was kind of where my brain went. I was like why if you know everybody's supposed to have health care or you know there's always Medicaid or whatever.

1096
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:38,000
But I did research and I tried to figure out what's going on. It turns out it's because of the condition.

1097
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:41,000
I guess there's not a lot of...

1098
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,000
I've heard of this.

1099
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Yeah FDA or whoever approved stuff.

1100
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:53,000
So it sounds like the child's going to Mexico to get treatment where the industry is not as heavily regulated because this condition is so rare.

1101
01:13:53,000 --> 01:14:00,000
So I will say I kind of put it under that eye and I was like okay this makes sense. I understand why they need to raise money.

1102
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Although they've been doing it quietly.

1103
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:13,000
The issue with this particular thing is it actually concerns the chemical that delivers that controls hemoglobin to deliver oxygen to the body.

1104
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:20,000
And it's an excess of that. So it's pretty pretty serious. So I hope that you can find the good treatment for it.

1105
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Well I hope he's made lots of money for his son off of this game and I hope the son is able to get a little help there.

1106
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:33,000
And a lot of people have kind of gone that's why that game's never on sale.

1107
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Yeah so that might kind of explain it a little bit there.

1108
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:40,000
So anyhow there you go Axiom Verge a little news there with the publisher.

1109
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Let's move on.

1110
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Dar Sakura a few more stories then we'll get to the classic of the week.

1111
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Well there's been a 20 month suspension of a League of Legends champion player named who goes by Vasily Lee Wei Jun.

1112
01:14:54,000 --> 01:15:00,000
On his Twitch channel he screamed and threatened his girlfriend at the time.

1113
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Overturned furniture and basically issued threats severe enough to warrant a visit from the police.

1114
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:18,000
And so just after that broadcast finished basically the team he was on ended their contract with him.

1115
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:22,000
They just booted him out. His girlfriend left him as well she should have.

1116
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Although she said that he didn't beat her but he did smash everything around them.

1117
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:32,000
And that he did the whole thing on the live stream. So it is out there.

1118
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:44,000
And basically the League of Legends championship series said per their code of contact conduct sorry that he is under 20 months suspension.

1119
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:49,000
And that after that expires it's up to other league teams if they want to sign him.

1120
01:15:49,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Although they do understand that he had a history with quote violent tendencies and that he showed physical aggression on stage by smashing a keyboard and intimidating a camera operator during a match.

1121
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:21,000
They are considering looking into lifelong bans for that but this is what gets me is that well I'm sorry an indefinite ban quote fingers.

1122
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:29,000
That they give indefinite bans for cheating you know for match fixing and cheating.

1123
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:35,000
But they didn't put it on there for threatening the well-being of another person.

1124
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Yeah like you know with this whole story and what you're saying I was like okay okay okay okay like yep they're doing what they have to do.

1125
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Up until this part where you said he'd he'd done this type of violent shit on stage before.

1126
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Like this is an ambassador for your game and your brand on what is you know a very well watched thing on Twitch.

1127
01:16:54,000 --> 01:17:00,000
And like you know I you know I don't know maybe that maybe the the media hasn't gotten as in depth to this.

1128
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:07,000
But like where was the fucking slap on the wrist when he was yelling at camera operators and smashing keyboards and shit.

1129
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Like that should have been squelched then. That should have been a spanking then.

1130
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Well I swear to God some people's children.

1131
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:22,000
But on top of that the other thing is that they're treating you know cheating as a bigger offense than threatening another person.

1132
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Yeah yeah no I hear you loud and clear.

1133
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:32,000
But they did um Riot Games did admit that it it had a wide range of offenses that would be listed underneath it.

1134
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:38,000
And that they didn't anticipate having a situation where a pro player would turn out to be a domestic abuser.

1135
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:44,000
I'm gonna interject one thing here. Humans no matter what they do can be garbage.

1136
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:56,000
We have seen garbage like you know asshole from my state and Weinstein and all of those garbages out there being garbage.

1137
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:01,000
What's to say a gamer can't be garbage like this guy. This guy is garbage.

1138
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:05,000
And I'm I'm sorry they kind of had a hint.

1139
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Yeah they knew.

1140
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:11,000
But no he's a game. No he's garbage.

1141
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:15,000
And he should have been treated like garbage and thrown out the first time he was acting like garbage.

1142
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Or rehabilitated and recycled into something usable.

1143
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:23,000
If he can even learn. I mean sometimes people who.

1144
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,000
That's up to the person.

1145
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Yeah you have to want to change and if there's no incentive to change you're just going to keep being garbage.

1146
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Sorry if they can get away with it.

1147
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Because he was getting away with it.

1148
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Exactly.

1149
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,000
You need to hold.

1150
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:38,000
I'm sure he'll go to rehab. That's what everybody does now.

1151
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:42,000
You need to hold garbage people accountable for being garbage.

1152
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
End of story.

1153
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
That's. Mine's over.

1154
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
OK. All right.

1155
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:55,000
I don't know what else to say with that. I'm looking at our chat over at live dot vodka network dot com active says hasn't anyone learned from the fighting game community.

1156
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Dungeon Buster says I'm surprised you get an indefinite ban right then and there.

1157
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
I think that's about the smash keyboards itself.

1158
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
William murder face says what's next.

1159
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Someone says a slur one or the other at a tournament and Riot says they did not anticipate that could happen.

1160
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Well Riot games also didn't answer why they chose 20 months instead of indefinite.

1161
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:26,000
So but I mean having a policy that vague just opens the door for more abuses for things that people you have to have.

1162
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:32,000
This isn't somebody playing a match on like this isn't somebody like just a user of the game.

1163
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:35,000
This is a professional who's being paid to play this game.

1164
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
Exactly difference.

1165
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:55,000
And on top of that I mean if anything if he it should be something in the contract to there can be punitive damages for the I would expect like the negative PR that it gives the company you know that while you are playing this game you are a representative of the company.

1166
01:19:55,000 --> 01:20:00,000
You know it's ridiculous but no he's garbage.

1167
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,000
All right.

1168
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:05,000
Well sometimes you have to just paint over the garbage right Loki.

1169
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Yes you do.

1170
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:11,000
And way to transition into talking about Splatoon 2.

1171
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
I tried I really tried with that.

1172
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,000
You tried.

1173
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Which is not hot garbage.

1174
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,000
No it's not.

1175
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
No it's a lot of fun actually.

1176
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Well actually Splatoon 2 did have a garbage weekend and it was that weekend that mayonnaise fucking one versus ketchup.

1177
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
That was the best week ever.

1178
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,000
That was garbage.

1179
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Because ketchup is disgusting.

1180
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
No mayonnaise is actual garbage.

1181
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Mayonnaise is delicious.

1182
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,000
Anyway.

1183
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Anyways so there Nintendo announced that they have quite a bit of updates coming soon to Splatoon 2.

1184
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:48,000
So one of these actually is coming in mid-December which is a brand new game mode called Clam Blitz.

1185
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:53,000
So in Clam Blitz you basically have to collect different clams that are scattered throughout the stage.

1186
01:20:53,000 --> 01:21:01,000
And after you pick one up they'll follow the player around and then you have to get them into a basket that's near the opponent's base and they have like a shield around them.

1187
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:09,000
So in order to do that you collect 10 clams and then throw this power clam in there to basically score points on the first team to 100 wins.

1188
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Yay.

1189
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,000
So that's interesting.

1190
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:17,000
And then along with that of course they've got some new stuff for new battle stages coming out.

1191
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:22,000
So they just released one this weekend with the shell.

1192
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,000
What was it?

1193
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Mako Mart.

1194
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:32,000
And then I guess Shellendorf Institute Walleye Warehouse and Arowana Mall are going to be coming soon.

1195
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:38,000
And I guess they're saying that there's going to be new salmon run stages as well.

1196
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:45,000
So I guess they're saying that the salmonoid smokeyard is going to be added to the rotation.

1197
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,000
They have new gear.

1198
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:49,000
So 140 pieces of new gear as well.

1199
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:55,000
Shoes, headgear, clothes and you know these additional winter clothing as well.

1200
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
New battle music.

1201
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:01,000
So they've got I guess they said two new bands in the game.

1202
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,000
New hairstyles.

1203
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
They have four new hairstyles.

1204
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Two female, two male.

1205
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:10,000
They've raised the level cap from 50 to 99.

1206
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:18,000
And then I guess they also have the ability to I guess like prestige.

1207
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:25,000
You know they would call it in Call of Duty where you can reset your level and continue raising the level from there.

1208
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
New amiibo functions.

1209
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:32,000
So they're going to have I guess tapping the amiibo in the game will allow you to share in-game photos.

1210
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:37,000
And I don't know if it's done.

1211
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Oh we can add filters and stuff.

1212
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
So we'll do those videos too I guess.

1213
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Probably too much for an amiibo.

1214
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Yeah.

1215
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:48,000
And also I guess they're saying that they're going to allow you to swap gear a little bit easier.

1216
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:54,000
So you'll be able to change gear between battles in regular rattle ranked battle.

1217
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,000
Thanks God.

1218
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
That was oh my God.

1219
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
That was one of those things I couldn't believe wasn't in there.

1220
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
You could not change your gear between that.

1221
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Thank God.

1222
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,000
Yeah.

1223
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:04,000
So that's cool.

1224
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Didn't mention though if you need the app for that.

1225
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Wasn't that one of the ways one of the things that the app was for is like switching gear.

1226
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,000
No you could.

1227
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:14,000
It was like additional gear you could buy and you could get it.

1228
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:22,000
I don't want to say the shady marketplace but it just kind of was you know it was just another way to buy gear basically and different stuff.

1229
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:25,000
And you can also see like what teams your friends are on and so forth.

1230
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:28,000
The chat room is saying that the update is live already by the way.

1231
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
This isn't something that is coming.

1232
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
It's done already here.

1233
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Well yes some of the things I know that were coming.

1234
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:39,000
But they mentioned that you know one of the stages was released and then the rest were coming soon.

1235
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Got it.

1236
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,000
So I didn't think it'd be like the very next day.

1237
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Well then this is the good news that you know all of it's free essentially.

1238
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:50,000
And this is the good thing that Nintendo has not figured out loot boxes yet.

1239
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Can't get that online.

1240
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Am I right?

1241
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Yeah.

1242
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,000
All right.

1243
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Act F says yeah you buy special gear through the app not change.

1244
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:02,000
Fifth Dream asked can we get this update for Final Fantasy 15 Comrades 2 please.

1245
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
That's one of those things I need to go back and visit.

1246
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
I still need the playthrough 15.

1247
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Oh you should.

1248
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
It's worth playing through.

1249
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:13,000
I know it's just I'll do it one of these days.

1250
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:20,000
Maybe like a whole maybe 2018 I just buy no games and just play through like 500 games I have in my backlog.

1251
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:24,000
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says Nintendo definitely figured out loot boxes.

1252
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:27,000
What happened at the end of every stage in Super Mario Brothers 3.

1253
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:32,000
Yeah but if you would run and get your P meter full and jump at a 45 degree angle you could hack those loot boxes.

1254
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,000
You always get a star.

1255
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
That's what the toad houses were for though.

1256
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,000
That's true.

1257
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,000
You could hack that game too though.

1258
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Yeah I remember that too.

1259
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:41,000
Wasn't it based on where like the Hammer Brothers was or something like that.

1260
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:46,000
There's a certain place on the screen that you look and every time you push the button in that position and that's where it'll stop.

1261
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Anyway.

1262
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:53,000
So yeah you can hack the shit out of that stuff because it's not online.

1263
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
I say hack but it's not really hacking.

1264
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:59,000
That's just getting good as they say.

1265
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:05,000
Alright hey one of the games that I really liked and I don't remember if this game had loot boxes.

1266
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,000
I guess it kind of did.

1267
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,000
It had a loot wheel.

1268
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,000
But I don't remember buying spins on the loot wheel.

1269
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,000
Maybe that was something you could do.

1270
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
I don't know but it's Forza Horizon is what I'm talking about.

1271
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:17,000
And Forza Horizon is by a developer called Playground Games.

1272
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:24,000
And what happened is that they actually announced back in February that they are making a non-racing game.

1273
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,000
Gasp.

1274
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Which sadly does that mean we're not getting Forza Horizon 4?

1275
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Or did that get passed to a different developer?

1276
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
Or is there two teams now there?

1277
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,000
I don't know.

1278
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,000
We don't know about that.

1279
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,000
But anyway.

1280
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:40,000
All we know about this non-racing game is it's an open world game.

1281
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:44,000
But they are apparently working based on new reports.

1282
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
It's an open world action RPG.

1283
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:54,000
They have hired talent from Metal Gear Solid, Hellblade, Suna's Sacrifice, and GTA 5.

1284
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:58,000
This all comes in a report from gameindustry.biz.

1285
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:04,000
And they obtained the new details on this studio that they're forming to work on the RPG.

1286
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:11,000
So Playground brought Sean Istone, Will Kennedy, and Juan Fernandez de Simon on the project.

1287
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:14,000
And they are all from those different teams I named a little bit ago.

1288
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:19,000
So they said, we're delighted we've secured a second studio to house our new team.

1289
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,000
Oh, there's the answer.

1290
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:24,000
This is a hugely exciting project that is already attracting world class talent to Playground.

1291
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:29,000
The combination of New Blood and experienced Playground team members is already showing huge promise.

1292
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:34,000
And I'm excited to see this talented group contribute to Playground's continued success.

1293
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
That is all from CEO Gavin Rayburn.

1294
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:37,000
So there you go.

1295
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Awesome.

1296
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Yeah, I'm really excited to see what they come up with then.

1297
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,000
And that's good.

1298
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:46,000
That means that Forza Horizon 4 really could still happen.

1299
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
And it could just all be the Hot Wheels thing.

1300
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,000
It'll be on...

1301
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:55,000
What was that game that Atari did back in the game with the loop?

1302
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
Hard Drivin'? Was that the game?

1303
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,000
Yeah.

1304
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,000
Yeah, it's just...

1305
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
Forza Horizon just needs to go full on hard driving.

1306
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Oh, the nap machine.

1307
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:04,000
What, the what?

1308
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,000
Hard Drivin', the nap machine.

1309
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:08,000
Oh yeah, the cabinet was so big you could get in there and take a nap.

1310
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:09,000
I used to.

1311
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:10,000
At work.

1312
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,000
It's like the old Test Drive games.

1313
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:12,000
Yeah, yeah, right.

1314
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:13,000
The old Test Drive games.

1315
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,000
They were like...

1316
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,000
I do.

1317
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
The graphics were as shitty as the hard driving.

1318
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Dungeon Busters Suggest in chat.

1319
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:23,000
Kingdoms of Forza, The Reckoning, minus Curt Schilling.

1320
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:24,000
Let's hope so.

1321
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
I don't think that guy's ever gonna make it...

1322
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
I want a racing game that's set in the medieval times.

1323
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Or you just fight with...

1324
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:33,000
It's an action RPG featuring just real racing cars.

1325
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:35,000
You just...

1326
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,000
I don't know.

1327
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:39,000
Alright, let's take a trip down memory lane.

1328
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
The classic game of the week.

1329
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
Back in the day when...

1330
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:44,000
You didn't have your...

1331
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:48,000
Your studios were limited to three cartridges in a calendar year.

1332
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:52,000
And if you were gonna make more games than that, you just had to open up a second wing.

1333
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
Hello Ultra Games, Tommy.

1334
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,000
See what you're doing there?

1335
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
It's a classic game of the week.

1336
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
You know that was a thing, right?

1337
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
That because the Atari 2600 went...

1338
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:05,000
Because there were just garbage games coming out for it.

1339
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:10,000
But if you wanted your games to come out on Nintendo, Nintendo limited you to three games a year.

1340
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,000
Ten games a year.

1341
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:15,000
But that's when somebody reversed it to your cartridge.

1342
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,000
I'm sorry, I'm not telling you.

1343
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
What's the other one in another Konami studio that was...

1344
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,000
It was Ultra.

1345
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Ultra, that's right.

1346
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Ultra put out the Ninja Turtles game in Metal Gear, didn't they?

1347
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Yeah.

1348
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,000
Metal Gear Stakes Adventures.

1349
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
Anyway, the classic game of the week.

1350
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:30,000
This particular selection was after all that though, actually, right?

1351
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,000
Yes.

1352
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Whale, whale, after that.

1353
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:36,000
This is actually one of those it just turned 10 picks, right?

1354
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,000
Yes, it did.

1355
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:41,000
Super Mario Galaxy came out in 2007.

1356
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:45,000
It came out for the Wii.

1357
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:48,000
Remember how much shit we gave them for the Wii?

1358
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
Let's suppose that you're writing a really...

1359
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
I thought I got rid of ads on...

1360
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
Oh, I switched my browser, that's why.

1361
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,000
Girl.

1362
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Sorry about that, guys.

1363
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:05,000
Anyway, it also was released in 2011 as a Nintendo Selects title and downloadable via

1364
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:08,000
the Wii U's eShop in 2015.

1365
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:14,000
Mario has to go rescue Princess Peach while saving the universe from Bowser this time.

1366
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Because, like, bitch ain't got other things to do.

1367
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:23,000
So basically the galaxies were all like little planets.

1368
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:30,000
And you had different variations of gravity, different things that could go on, you'd have

1369
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:33,000
different platforms to move around.

1370
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:39,000
And basically it took concepts that came from Super Mario 128, which was a tech demonstration

1371
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:43,000
from Nintendo Space World in 2000.

1372
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:48,000
The development began just after that tech demo came out.

1373
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:57,000
And it was actually after the release of Donkey Kong Jungle Beat in 2004 is when that came up.

1374
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:03,000
And it was actually a suggestion by Miyamoto himself that Nintendo should commission another

1375
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
large-scale Mario game.

1376
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:08,000
And so it was...

1377
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,000
There you go.

1378
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:16,000
It also was one of the first Mario games that had a symphony orchestra with music composed

1379
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:22,000
by Koji Kondo and Mahito Yokota.

1380
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:25,000
Sorry, not Yokota, that's the wrong word.

1381
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:31,000
Anyway, it was really considered to be one of the best games of its era.

1382
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
I mean, even today.

1383
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:36,000
It won game of the year across many boards.

1384
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:42,000
And it was the first Nintendo title to win the British Academy games award for best games.

1385
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
So there you go.

1386
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:48,000
It is the ninth best-selling Wii game worldwide.

1387
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:53,000
And the best-selling 3D Mario, Super Mario entry.

1388
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:57,000
And of course it had a sequel, Super Mario Galaxy 2.

1389
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:00,000
It came out for the Wii in 2010.

1390
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:09,000
So you would use it, you know, you played it as many games did with the Wiimote and the Nunchuck.

1391
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Mario's abilities came from Super Mario 64.

1392
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:16,000
So he had all of his fun jumps in the somersaults.

1393
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:21,000
And he had the star pointer that would show you...

1394
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:29,000
It would show up when you pointed the Wiimote at the screen so that you could find different star bits

1395
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
that looked like a Conpetto.

1396
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:34,000
So it was really, really just a neat little game.

1397
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
You got your power-ups.

1398
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:40,000
You have the spring suit and the boo suit and the bee suit.

1399
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:46,000
And your health meter was a three-piece health meter.

1400
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:50,000
Just the usual stuff that you expect in a Mario game.

1401
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:57,000
You could get your 50 coins without losing a life or 50 star bits or 1-up mushroom to get you extra lives.

1402
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:03,000
And then you had co-star mode where one person controls Mario

1403
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:08,000
and the other one basically has a second star pointer that you can shoot at enemies with.

1404
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:12,000
So it was really well received overall.

1405
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:18,000
The game was a novel concept for when it came out too, just with it using gravity the way it was.

1406
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:21,000
And it was really considered just a fun game.

1407
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:24,000
The music was fantastic.

1408
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:30,000
Like I said, it was orchestral with a 50 person symphony orchestra.

1409
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:33,000
And it fit the game quite well.

1410
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
It sold great.

1411
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:39,000
And it has the sixth highest rating on Metacritic.

1412
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:43,000
It was a 97 out of 100 based on 73 reviews at the time.

1413
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:50,000
So even while Famitsu doesn't really give out perfect scores that much,

1414
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
they gave them a 38 out of 40.

1415
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:56,000
So they got really, really fantastic ratings.

1416
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
And so there we go.

1417
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
It is a pretty fucking great Mario game.

1418
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,000
Yeah.

1419
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:04,000
And so that's the game, Super Mario Galaxy.

1420
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
I kinda can't believe it's 10 years old.

1421
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
Thwomp, thwomp.

1422
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Thwomp, thwomp.

1423
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,000
Thwomp, thwomp.

1424
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:12,000
Blarg, blarg.

1425
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:17,000
All right, there it is, your classic game of the week for the Wii, Super Mario Galaxy,

1426
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:23,000
which the chat room, by the way, did catch and called out your Freudian slip earlier in the show.

1427
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:26,000
Oh, that's why she said Mario Galaxy at the beginning of the show.

1428
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:32,000
That actually wasn't why I said it, but I had been listening to the music before coming up here.

1429
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
And now we're going to open the maple cookies.

1430
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:35,000
All right.

1431
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:36,000
Yay, cookies.

1432
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,000
That means we're going to take a break.

1433
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:38,000
Have Hokkaido Momiji cookies.

1434
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,000
Sure.

1435
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
Just make sure Mr. Smoosh doesn't try to eat them all.

1436
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:42,000
All right.

1437
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
His ears perked when I said that.

1438
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
That cat is going to ruin this show.

1439
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:47,000
We're going to take a quick break.

1440
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:48,000
We're going to come back, though.

1441
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:52,000
There's much more show to come, including another Iwata tribute.

1442
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,000
I think it's really cute.

1443
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:54,000
We're going to get to in rapid fire news.

1444
01:33:54,000 --> 01:34:00,000
We're also going to talk about what's going on in Pokemon Go, besides me spending money, and theme parks,

1445
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:04,000
when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

1446
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:13,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

1447
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:21,000
Live tonight, episode number 708 for this November the 26th of 2017, enjoying those last few minutes of the long weekend.

1448
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:28,000
For those of you that got a long weekend, I know some of you brave souls work in retail and other industries that have you working over the weekend.

1449
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:31,000
Even I worked on Friday, which is weird.

1450
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:34,000
I have the type of office job that usually isn't there on Black Friday.

1451
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:42,000
But we were there, so I didn't get a full weekend, but I had a nice restful Saturday and Sunday after the fact.

1452
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:45,000
So I hope you guys had a nice restful weekend as well.

1453
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:52,000
During the break, I know we can't play these on the podcast because, you know, we can't distribute someone else's songs and all that stuff.

1454
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:56,000
But we did play a song randomly from Soul Calibur during the music break tonight.

1455
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:01,000
And some folks in chat, Vid Power, said, I hope they make another Soul Calibur game again.

1456
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
And Fifth Dream says, yes, we need Soul Calibur badly.

1457
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:09,000
Well, it didn't make the show roll tonight because we addressed it a little bit last week.

1458
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:13,000
There are heavy rumors picking up about Soul Calibur 6.

1459
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:20,000
But now, I feel like Namco Bandai, because of that rumor, started putting out conflicting rumors this week.

1460
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:28,000
Meaning, like, now we're hearing, oh, it's not being unveiled at PSX, it's being unveiled at the Video Game Awards.

1461
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:34,000
And, oh, the bonus character on Nintendo is not Link, it's one of the Fire Emblem characters instead.

1462
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:37,000
So, there's a lot of, like, noise out there on that front.

1463
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:40,000
But it does sound like one way or another, Soul Calibur 6 is going to happen.

1464
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Which makes sense. I mean, those Soul Calibur games have always sold pretty well, haven't they?

1465
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:49,000
It's been a while. Soul Calibur 5 was a PlayStation 3 exclusive, if I'm right, right?

1466
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
Did they put that anywhere else? I think.

1467
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:56,000
I know 4 was on Xbox 360 because 4 had Yoda, Invader, and all that stuff, right?

1468
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
Yoda. Yoda.

1469
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:02,000
But 5 was only on PlayStation 3, if I remember right.

1470
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:06,000
So, it'll be interesting to see what they do with 6. It does seem like it should be time for that.

1471
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:11,000
Fifth Dream in Chat says, Soul Calibur 6 should be insanely beautiful on PlayStation 4 Pro.

1472
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:17,000
Bob Coffee says, Soul Calibur 6 probably won't happen until Tekken 7 is done, I imagine.

1473
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
Eh, there could be different teams. Who knows?

1474
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:23,000
JD says 5 was also on 360. Okay, I must've missed that.

1475
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:28,000
4 was the one that had Yoda, Invader, right? I didn't get that confused.

1476
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:34,000
No, okay, I know what it is. Soul Calibur 3 was a PlayStation 2 exclusive, right?

1477
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:38,000
That was when they first spread out, like the hula hoop girl and the...

1478
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:43,000
Yeah, some of those other characters. So, who was the character in Soul Calibur 5?

1479
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Who was the bonus character they put in that?

1480
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
Was 5 Vader? Or was that 4?

1481
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:52,000
No, that was 4. I don't remember who the bonus characters were.

1482
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
Was it Kratos?

1483
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
That sounds right. I think you're right.

1484
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
Was it Kratos and then was it Higachi?

1485
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
Ezio. Ezio.

1486
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:03,000
That's right. I think Ezio was on both.

1487
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:07,000
Yeah, the game's guest character is Ezio from Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.

1488
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
That's what it was.

1489
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:10,000
Oh.

1490
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:14,000
There it is. And then they're saying Kratos in chat as well.

1491
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
So, there you go. I don't see that in the Wiki article.

1492
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:19,000
I thought that was only on, well obviously only on Linzoni.

1493
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
And then...

1494
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
Yeah.

1495
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:26,000
No, that was Dead or Alive.

1496
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
Never mind.

1497
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
Yeah. Yeah, Soul Calibur 5 with Ezio.

1498
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:33,000
Okay, it's been a while. I mean, it's been a while since those games were out.

1499
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:36,000
So, we're due for Soul Calibur 6. I'm sure it's gonna happen.

1500
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:41,000
Anyway, let's get to some rapid fire news and quickly talk about some other stuff going on in the gaming world. Loki.

1501
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:47,000
So, this is just silly, but apparently, you know, Sonic Forces has the whole create your own Sonic character that they have in there.

1502
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:51,000
Quickly. Kratos was on the handheld spinoff. That's why we're getting confused.

1503
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:54,000
Because there was a Soul Calibur on the handheld. That's where Kratos was.

1504
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
I thought he was also on the console.

1505
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
That's where we're getting confused. Anyway, go ahead.

1506
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:04,000
Anyways, so Sonic Forces, you know, they have the whole thing where you can actually design your own Sonic character to play as in the game.

1507
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:13,000
So now, they have an update. I guess it's free DLC where you can get a Sanic t-shirt for your character.

1508
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:14,000
That's right, Sanic.

1509
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
But can you get a Princess Zordla shirt?

1510
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
Nah, Princess Zordla. I'm sorry.

1511
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,000
Zordla!

1512
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:20,000
Just the Sanic.

1513
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:21,000
Danky Kang.

1514
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:24,000
Just the Sanic Hedgehog t-shirt. So, that's kind of funny.

1515
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:25,000
What about Patch?

1516
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:30,000
I kind of love how meme-aware the Sonic social media team is.

1517
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,000
It's pretty great.

1518
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
It is pretty funny. At least they can poke fun at themselves.

1519
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:38,000
If only they would be aware that we fucking want PSO2. But hey. Or PSO2, excuse me. But hey.

1520
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:48,000
And in other Sonic news, apparently there has been a new patch that's been created for Sonic 3D Blast.

1521
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:57,000
And this is actually a patch that was developed by, I guess, one of the lead programmers and founders of Traveler's Tales who does the LEGO games now.

1522
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:04,000
And I guess he was one of the original lead programmers as well of the game.

1523
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:07,000
Apparently, yeah, he's in the...

1524
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
What did he do here?

1525
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:20,000
Because Sonic 3D is a part of the Sonic legacy, and Sonic had a mixed legacy, I'd like to address where I can my part in that.

1526
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:30,000
If I can make Sonic 3D a bit more acceptable to the Sonic fan base within a few days of my time, then great. Why not try it?

1527
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:37,000
So he has a Sonic 3D Blast, or Sonic 3D Blast DX, the director's cut.

1528
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:47,000
I'm not exactly sure what they changed on it to make it better, because I didn't really play a lot of Sonic 3D Blast.

1529
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:54,000
Yeah, that game's kind of hard to get into, honestly. But that's, you know, out of the Sonic games.

1530
01:39:54,000 --> 01:40:01,000
So they fixed some of the handling in the game, it looks like. They have a time challenge mode.

1531
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:04,000
They set a better camera.

1532
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:09,000
I guess you can save passwords. There's a level editor.

1533
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:13,000
A crab, I guess, was in a prototype thing.

1534
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:20,000
Difficulty tweaks, options, pallets, a lot of new stuff. So that's kind of cool.

1535
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:24,000
And I'm not sure where you can get the patch, but I'm sure this is the internet. Google it.

1536
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:28,000
Alright, let's talk about some tournament news.

1537
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:33,000
Actually, I've got some updates on Genesis 5, which is a tournament not far from here.

1538
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:38,000
It's going to be in Oakland this year, at the Oakland Convention Center, running January, I think it's 19th through the 21st.

1539
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:44,000
And actually they're saying that the finals, the top 8 finals, will be at the Paramount Theater, which is a real gorgeous concert venue.

1540
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:49,000
I saw Bjork there, back in the day. That was on the Vesper Teen Tour, that's how long ago that was.

1541
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:55,000
But anyway, so that's pretty cool that the Genesis tournament, and not to be confused with Sega Genesis, sorry.

1542
01:40:55,000 --> 01:41:03,000
It's actually mostly a fighting game tournament, and they announced that Street Fighter 5 is going to be there, but also some older hits.

1543
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:08,000
And I think this is really cool, including Super Smash Brothers, the original, as well as Melee and Wii U.

1544
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:13,000
DDR Extreme, they're going to have a contest on. That's pretty rad.

1545
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:18,000
Not the newer DDRs, DDR Extreme, the one that we had during that long period.

1546
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:22,000
DDR USA, let's go that far back, or fourth next year.

1547
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:30,000
So these are all additions for Saturday only, Marvel vs. Capcom, Infinite in there too, Pokken, Tournament DX, Act After You Listening.

1548
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:34,000
All those games are going to be there for Genesis, so that's really awesome.

1549
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:39,000
I noticed Splatoon 2 is going to be one of the games they're doing a tournament on as well, so that'll be fun.

1550
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:44,000
Hey, speaking of tournaments, this one caught my eye, another news for this.

1551
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:52,000
January 27th, also in the Bay Area, namely San Jose at Round 1, there's going to be a DDR tournament.

1552
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:55,000
And this is really trying to be like an old school DDR tournament.

1553
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:59,000
They are calling this Freestyle Takeover, is the name of this tournament.

1554
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:04,000
It was just announced, and it was announced of course on 20 November, which was on Monday.

1555
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:08,000
And you can get tickets on Eventbrite, although I believe it's going to be free just to go watch.

1556
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:13,000
But it is $15 to compete, and I think it is a pure freestyle tournament.

1557
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:17,000
I haven't seen anything for, yeah, and it even says in the about,

1558
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:21,000
a devoted community has kept the game alive through technical feats, score-based feats.

1559
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:25,000
Freestyle has laid dominant for years, or dormant, excuse me, dormant for years.

1560
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:32,000
And I know a friend of the show who's been on way back in the day, Mel B, this is who's Facebook that I caught it on,

1561
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:37,000
and I wonder if he's going to do a new freestyle routine all these years later.

1562
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:42,000
It sounds like a lot of these guys that were kind of, you know, well known for freestyling back in the old school days of DDR

1563
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:47,000
in the earlier days of the show, might be dusting them shoes off to do some new freestyle routines.

1564
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:51,000
So this would be a lot of fun. Dark Sakura, maybe we should go find some orange bats.

1565
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:54,000
I still have mine.

1566
01:42:54,000 --> 01:43:00,000
Maybe we could enter, I don't know. Anyway, the first thing I said to Mel when I heard about this was,

1567
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:04,000
how can we help here at OLR, because we're still here all these years later.

1568
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:10,000
I would love to go just say hello, and you know, even if maybe we can like donate a prize or something, we'll figure something out.

1569
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:15,000
I'm sure I have like old VRares and stuff that I was never able to give away back in the day.

1570
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:18,000
I could throw into a prize pot or something, so we'll figure that out.

1571
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:23,000
But anyway, I know I'm planning on going. Hopefully my co-host can make a cameo as well.

1572
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:26,000
That'll be the end of next month.

1573
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
Moving on, Dark Sakura.

1574
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:44,000
Well, there is more coming out for The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild.

1575
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:48,000
Something that's more of a little gift.

1576
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:53,000
But basically, hold on just a second.

1577
01:43:53,000 --> 01:44:00,000
Basically, if you duck down and open a chest, Link will throw out a punching animation.

1578
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:07,000
Basically, it's just like a little thing that they've discovered.

1579
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:10,000
It was on the Tips from the Wild news channel.

1580
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
So it's just a neat thing.

1581
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:23,000
And then in other news, Pokemon Ultra Sun and Moon have a tribute to Satoru Iwata.

1582
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:38,000
Basically, in this particular one, if you visit the Game Freak building while having a gold or silver Pokemon in your party,

1583
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:43,000
they will say that the developers were helped out by an amazing guy.

1584
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:46,000
So there you go.

1585
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:51,000
Yeah, that's a really cute little tribute in the Pokemon games.

1586
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:55,000
I kind of skipped buying them because I never finish Pokemon games.

1587
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:58,000
And I'm waiting for the Switch version at this point.

1588
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
That's kind of where I'm at.

1589
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:03,000
But I've heard some good feedback on Ultra Sun and Moon.

1590
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
Maybe I'll change my mind.

1591
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
I keep hearing it as ultrasound.

1592
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:11,000
Alright, let's travel around the world and check out what games are coming out this week.

1593
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:14,000
Although I have a feeling it's going to be really slow, right, Loki?

1594
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:17,000
Yeah, it's definitely slowing down towards the end of the year.

1595
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:22,000
Especially after the first few months of November, it's just dead until March.

1596
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:29,000
So we've got, starting off, Resident Evil Revelations and Resident Evil Revelations 2 on the Nintendo Switch.

1597
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:33,000
Little Witch Academia, Chamber of Time on PlayStation 4.

1598
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:36,000
Siberia 2 on the Nintendo Switch.

1599
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:41,000
The game, Paradise Cruise and Mix on PC and PlayStation 4.

1600
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:45,000
7, The Days Long Gone on PC.

1601
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:49,000
And finally Xenoblade Chronicles 2 on Nintendo Switch.

1602
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
That's it.

1603
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:54,000
Alright, traveling to Japan on November 30th.

1604
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:59,000
Little Witch Academia Toki no Mahoutou Nanafushi comes out.

1605
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
There's a new Nobunaga game this week.

1606
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:05,000
Nobunaga no Yabu Taishi comes out on November 30th.

1607
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:08,000
As well as Game Paradise Cruise and Mix.

1608
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:11,000
That same game I think Loki just referenced here in the US.

1609
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
That is also out in Japan.

1610
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:16,000
Sounds like there's a new Dragon Quest Slime Controller.

1611
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:19,000
Because you can never have enough Dragon Quest Slime Controllers.

1612
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:24,000
On the Vita this week, Uso Suki Shangri-La comes out in a regular and limited edition.

1613
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:28,000
As well as Gakuen Club Himitsu no Night Club.

1614
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
That's like school club something.

1615
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
It's always school games, isn't it?

1616
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
On the Nintendo Switch, guess what?

1617
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:39,000
Nobunaga no Yabu also on the Switch in regular and treasure box editions.

1618
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:42,000
So I'm assuming this is the first Nobunaga game on Switch.

1619
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:43,000
So that's pretty cool.

1620
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:46,000
Biohazard Revelations, which of course means Resident Evil.

1621
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
The collection and the unveiled edition.

1622
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
Also out in Japan this week.

1623
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:56,000
And a whole bunch of different accessories and pouches if you are looking to carry your Nintendo Switch in a hip new way.

1624
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:59,000
One more game worth mentioning on the Nintendo 3DS.

1625
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
Act F, are you listening up?

1626
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:06,000
Kirby Battle Deluxe is out this week on November 30th on the 3DS.

1627
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:12,000
And if you've been holding off on it, Monster Hunter XX gets a price reduction this week.

1628
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:16,000
And maybe Dark Sakura would be interested in the Dragon Ball Extreme Fusion Pack.

1629
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:19,000
Alright, how about the UK Dark Sakura?

1630
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:22,000
Just a couple of things on the 28th.

1631
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:28,000
Black Mirror for Playstation 4 and Xbox One and Game Dev Tycoon for iPad and iPhone.

1632
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:31,000
Black Mirror like the show?

1633
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:34,000
Because that would be pretty awesome if there's a game based on the show.

1634
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:39,000
Yeah, I was actually seeing that on the release chart I was looking at here.

1635
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:42,000
I know they have a new season coming out. I saw the trailer for that.

1636
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:43,000
They do.

1637
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:46,000
Is there something about a reboot of the game?

1638
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:52,000
Gothic Point and Click Adventure Black Mirror is getting a reboot by THQ Nordic.

1639
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
Oh, well that's not unfortunately what I'm looking at.

1640
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:57,000
No, it is not related to the TV show.

1641
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
That is kind of interesting though that they have...

1642
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
That looks kind of neat though.

1643
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:04,000
I'm curious to see what that looks like in motion. It kind of looks like the seventh guest to me.

1644
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
And some of those things.

1645
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
Alright, sorry I guess Chat Room is yelling at me.

1646
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:13,000
It's Monster Hunter Double Cross which shows you how long ago I kind of...

1647
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
I tried to get it to the one on Wii U.

1648
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
That shows you how little Rob cares.

1649
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
Well, I don't want to say that because some people are into it.

1650
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
It's just Monster Hunter Kiss Kiss. That's all it is.

1651
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:25,000
Kiss Kiss. Monster Hunter Kiss Kiss. I like that better.

1652
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:28,000
Alright, let's get to the mailbag.

1653
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:31,000
You guys email us and we try to respond.

1654
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:32,000
Try.

1655
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:36,000
Unless we forget, which I guess is the case with one of our emails this week.

1656
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
Participate at OrangeOnTrader.com.

1657
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
This is the place to send your emails.

1658
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
Let's get to it.

1659
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:43,000
Okay.

1660
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:46,000
Hey, OLR crew, AZHP here.

1661
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
I'm a bit behind on your podcast.

1662
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:52,000
Due to just recently getting married and being in Japan on my honeymoon, Mazel Tov.

1663
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:53,000
Congrats.

1664
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:59,000
And I wanted to chime in about a story you had on October 23rd about IGN acquiring Humble Bundle.

1665
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:07,000
You all, like many other people, are under the continued assumption that Humble Bundle is still only a bundle portal which has sliders for charity.

1666
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:10,000
I am not under that impression. You are wrong.

1667
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
Because I know they have a store portal.

1668
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:15,000
I'm just not good at the impression that IGN's evil. That's all.

1669
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:21,000
I think it's been a while. And this was, to be fair to the emailer, this is the one that we forgot to read when it first came in.

1670
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
And I don't know how we skipped it. So sorry about that.

1671
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:26,000
But I'm trying to remember where we were at.

1672
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:29,000
But yeah, I know they have a storefront because that's one of the things.

1673
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:32,000
I've known this for a while. I've bought games to them before.

1674
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:37,000
But to be fair, I think most people know it from the bundles.

1675
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
Like, you know, at least that's kind of where it started.

1676
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:40,000
Yeah, but way to assume.

1677
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
Yeah, well, I don't know. I have to go back and listen to the episode.

1678
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:45,000
It's very possible we were focusing on that element of it.

1679
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:55,000
Anyway, the truth is Humble Bundle has for some time been a straight up video game storefront similar to Steam and Origin.

1680
01:49:55,000 --> 01:50:02,000
IGN is likely buying them because they see future in the storefront and the publishing arm, not in the charity bundle aspect.

1681
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:12,000
Loki also mentioned that there were potential conflicts of interest arising from Humble Bundle published games being reviewed by IGN as a publication.

1682
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:19,000
While this is a valid concern, as a former employee I will be the first to say that IGN had scummy business practices as all hell.

1683
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:26,000
The editors took their job seriously and didn't let publishers and marketing teams strong arm them in deducing review scores for the sake of the deal.

1684
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:32,000
It's been five or so years since I've been there. They could certainly have changed, but I don't see a cause for concern there.

1685
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:38,000
I know I made it. Loki's like, was that the cat? No, that was me making a nervous noise because I don't.

1686
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:44,000
OK, no, I appreciate the honest insight. I just.

1687
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:47,000
It's very blunt feedback, that's all I'm saying.

1688
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:53,000
Nobody said that while they had scummy practices, their editing was serious.

1689
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
OK, and they they gave fair reviews.

1690
01:50:55,000 --> 01:51:02,000
That's fair. So I also found it funny that Loki said it would be like if Fox News bought Humble Bundle and that'd be pretty sketchy.

1691
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:07,000
I don't know if you all were aware, but Fox News did in fact own IGN for a significant period of time.

1692
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:11,000
Yes, I'm well aware of that. And Rupert Murdoch was totally signing our paychecks.

1693
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:14,000
Yes, I'm well aware of that. Wow, I forgot.

1694
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:19,000
However, this influence only extended as far as the upper management treating employees mercilessly.

1695
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:28,000
Working passionate people, thankless, long hours and canning them when they were no longer needed and never manifesting as any sort of spin that was required for articles and reviews.

1696
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:36,000
You know, I hate to say it because this is going to sound really just like like I don't care, unempathetic.

1697
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:40,000
But like, isn't that the like entirety of the game industry?

1698
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:48,000
Not I'm not saying it's right, but I'm just saying, like, unfortunately, I hear this about a lot of places.

1699
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:54,000
I guess it really comes down to where do people feel valued and where do they not?

1700
01:51:54,000 --> 01:52:05,000
Most of the editors I was friends with were free thinking, free spirited people through and through and would certainly not have been there if they were forced to spend things in the way that Fox News was.

1701
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:12,000
Anyway, that was a bit of a ramble and I apologize, but those are my two cents on a Humble Bundle acquisition.

1702
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:18,000
As someone who used to work for IGN and has a somewhat jaded view on the matter, yours truly AZHP.

1703
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:24,000
Well, I'm sorry that we missed your email, but we didn't miss the second version.

1704
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:28,000
Thank you for that very blunt and candid feedback.

1705
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
I like blunt.

1706
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
No, I mean, don't get me wrong. I like it.

1707
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
I just, you know.

1708
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:38,000
I don't censor anything unless you say something shitty.

1709
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
And that's like actually.

1710
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:46,000
Or if the person says don't read this on air, we usually are not going to do that.

1711
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:47,000
Well, you know.

1712
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:51,000
So we have another email that came through the site.

1713
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:55,000
I've been listening for the last few years. I've enjoyed the show during my commute.

1714
01:52:55,000 --> 01:53:00,000
Thanks for the great show. I was wondering if there's a game you've been given crap for liking.

1715
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:08,000
I was recently playing games with my friends the other day and they were roasting me for being a fan of the Kingdom Hearts games because of this cringe worthy writing.

1716
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:11,000
Has this happened to you before? This is signed by Chris.

1717
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:17,000
I generally like awesome games, so no.

1718
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:20,000
I mean, most of us, we all kind of like a lot of the same stuff.

1719
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:24,000
Let me give you an example. Are there any MMOs you've been playing recently, Jamie?

1720
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:25,000
Girl.

1721
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
No. Are there any MMOs you've been playing recently?

1722
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:28,000
No, actually.

1723
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:29,000
Really? Nothing?

1724
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:33,000
Because I haven't re-upped on the two and I'm not playing Ragnarok online.

1725
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:34,000
Addict.

1726
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:37,000
I haven't touched it.

1727
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:42,000
I was trying to set her up for an addict joke, but then she had to dodge all over that question.

1728
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
Well, because I really wasn't playing anything.

1729
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
I know, but that's usually us giving each other shit.

1730
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:49,000
Wouldn't it be great if we had an Animal Crossing MMO for reals?

1731
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
That's what they could do on the Switch.

1732
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
They could, but are they? No.

1733
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:54,000
No, I'm not going to hold my breath.

1734
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:55,000
Bitches.

1735
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:56,000
An MMO on a Nintendo platform.

1736
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:01,000
Hey, it will be fucking noteworthy if it ever does happen. Just saying.

1737
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
We'll give it ten years.

1738
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:09,000
Oh, yeah. Thank you, Bobby. I should have just got her to talk about Mass Effect.

1739
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
Then I could have said Addict.

1740
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:12,000
Mass Effect is free.

1741
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
How many followers does your Tumblr have now?

1742
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:15,000
1,100.

1743
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:16,000
Addict.

1744
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:19,000
No, no, no, serious. No, that's not me being added.

1745
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:22,000
That's people being addicted to my product.

1746
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:26,000
I'm going to get Mr...

1747
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:27,000
They have the demand.

1748
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
Eight plus quality alien penis.

1749
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:34,000
I have to get more followers for Mr. Smoosh on Instagram.

1750
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:35,000
I'm just kidding.

1751
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
Mr. Smoosh will smoosh the competition.

1752
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
All you have to do is be as witty as I am.

1753
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:41,000
I don't know if I can do that.

1754
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:45,000
So, games that we get shit for liking.

1755
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:50,000
Probably my cell phone stuff, like Ingress and Pokemon Go.

1756
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:51,000
I definitely...

1757
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:52,000
What was that one game...

1758
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
I've been given shit for both of those.

1759
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
That we were building the apartments in?

1760
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:58,000
Tiny Tower?

1761
01:54:58,000 --> 01:54:59,000
Tiny Tower.

1762
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:00,000
Oh, yeah.

1763
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:01,000
That one for a bit.

1764
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:02,000
That came up last week.

1765
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
Did that come up on the show last week?

1766
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
I was just talking about that game like a week ago.

1767
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:07,000
Maybe.

1768
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:08,000
Anyway.

1769
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
There's been other games I'm sure we have...

1770
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
Dance Sense Revolution.

1771
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:13,000
Oh, yeah.

1772
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:14,000
That might be one too.

1773
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:18,000
People did kind of give us shit for President Cat even though we never actually played it

1774
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:19,000
unless we were Loki.

1775
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:23,000
Remember that totally fucking passive aggressive article some website wrote about the whole

1776
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:29,000
President Cat campaign about like, well, internet campaigns don't usually translate into good

1777
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:30,000
business sense.

1778
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:31,000
And look at the President now.

1779
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
Wouldn't you rather have a cat as the President?

1780
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:34,000
I mean, come on.

1781
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:39,000
A cat taking a shit would do a better job than the garbage we have now.

1782
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:47,000
Mr. Smoosh, please sneeze so that you can do a better job than number 45.

1783
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:49,000
Alright, anyway.

1784
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:52,000
Thank you, President Smoosh.

1785
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:54,000
That's the sequel.

1786
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
President Cat followed by President Smoosh.

1787
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:57,000
Loki, what about you?

1788
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:01,000
Surely there's nothing you play that people give you shit for playing.

1789
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
That your wife has ever given you shit for playing.

1790
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:04,000
That's like everything.

1791
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:08,000
There's nothing that my wife doesn't give me shit about enough.

1792
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:11,000
We give Loki shit for never finishing his own game.

1793
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:12,000
That's true.

1794
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:13,000
And I haven't really worked on game development.

1795
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
I've been thinking about working on game development.

1796
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:19,000
That's been my conflict, but I just haven't done that.

1797
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:23,000
I don't know.

1798
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:27,000
I guess one game I like that not a lot of people like would be Earth Defense Force.

1799
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:28,000
I like those games.

1800
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:32,000
I mean, if you objectively look at them, they're kind of crap.

1801
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
I don't know.

1802
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:39,000
But people don't really give me crap about playing games.

1803
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:42,000
I don't know.

1804
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
Who would do that?

1805
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:48,000
I just get crap for not making my own game.

1806
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:49,000
Which, yeah, that's fair enough.

1807
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
I have a legit answer for this.

1808
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:52,000
A game that I get shit for liking.

1809
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:57,000
Because everybody wants to shit on this game and call it one of the worst 8-bit games that they ever made.

1810
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
I don't think this game is as bad as people say it is.

1811
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000
Friday the 13th.

1812
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
I don't think it was a great game.

1813
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:04,000
It wasn't great.

1814
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:08,000
But I remember it was certainly one of the first games I remember having legit jump scares at.

1815
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:11,000
When you're in that fucking house and you turn a corner and then

1816
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:12,000
Bong, bong, bong, bong.

1817
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:15,000
And fluorescent Jason, is there a way to cut a bitch?

1818
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
That shit was scary.

1819
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:20,000
I gave my friend Julie shit for liking Mylon's Secret Castle.

1820
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:24,000
I fucking owned Mylon's Secret Castle. You apologized to Julie.

1821
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:28,000
Well, no, it's just because I didn't like that there was no way to continue.

1822
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:34,000
But I would have games that I would just sit and leave my Nintendo on all night and pray I didn't set the house on fire.

1823
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:37,000
That's how you had to do it back in the day.

1824
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:40,000
I used to do it too so my mom couldn't see it was on.

1825
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:43,000
I would have a blanket over the Nintendo or something.

1826
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:46,000
Because that'll make it less hot.

1827
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:50,000
Yeah, but like when you're like nine, you're not critical.

1828
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
I'd just prop up a cartridge in front of it.

1829
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
Or a cutout of a box.

1830
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
I don't remember those NES's getting that hot.

1831
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:59,000
I remember it was at the pocket station.

1832
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:00,000
You know, it had limited battery life.

1833
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:05,000
But I think if you plugged it into your Playstation or whatever, it would still play itself.

1834
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:08,000
And so I'd leave that in there overnight for days.

1835
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
And then come back and have all these items.

1836
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
People would give me shit about the money I would spend on games.

1837
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
Thank you, Doomplague.

1838
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
That game is underappreciated.

1839
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:20,000
I mean, it's not a good game, but it was ahead of its time in some ways.

1840
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:21,000
And Dark Tetsuya says,

1841
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
Rygar, I tried to beat that in one sitting.

1842
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:27,000
I remember staying up late with my uncle trying to get to the end in one go.

1843
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:28,000
It always blew me away.

1844
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:31,000
Like, how fucking different the NES Rygar and the arcade Rygar are.

1845
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
They are like two completely different games.

1846
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
It's like Strider.

1847
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
Well, but you know Strider is based off of the manga.

1848
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
One's the manga, one's the arcade.

1849
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:40,000
Yeah.

1850
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:45,000
But I think the biggest shit people would give me was for the money I spent on them.

1851
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:49,000
The very first import game I ever bought, I paid $110 for.

1852
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:52,000
And that was to get the Sailor Moon S fighting game.

1853
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:59,000
That I learned how to mod my game genie so that I could do the chibi moon butt attack.

1854
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:05,000
I'm gonna wait for the emails this week giving me shit about how much I confessed to spending on Pokemon Go this week.

1855
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
Girl.

1856
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:13,000
I spent $90 on the Rival Schools Evolution release that came out.

1857
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
You remember that one?

1858
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:16,000
I don't.

1859
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:17,000
It had like the school life dating sim.

1860
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:20,000
I just remember the Dreamcast game you owned with the fucking dish.

1861
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:21,000
That blows me away.

1862
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:22,000
Okay.

1863
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:23,000
You bought a game with a dish.

1864
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:24,000
And it wasn't even that great.

1865
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:29,000
It was the Cardcaptor Sakura game and I thought it was gonna be like Pokemon Snap with Cardcaptor Sakura.

1866
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:32,000
And it kind of was but it sucked.

1867
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:36,000
Cuz you, oh crap, why can't I remember her name?

1868
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:37,000
Her little friend.

1869
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
The cute little girl that makes all of her costumes.

1870
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
You're asking the wrong person.

1871
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:42,000
Ugh.

1872
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:43,000
I can't remember.

1873
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:44,000
More of a Ranma question I would think.

1874
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:48,000
S2100 Matt in chat says, uh, Dr. Seuss is Kuro?

1875
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:49,000
No, not Kero-chan.

1876
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:52,000
S2100 Matt says, I think people got a ton of shit for playing Runescape.

1877
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:53,000
Tomoyo.

1878
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:54,000
Back in the day.

1879
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:55,000
Tomoyo.

1880
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
Do you know how many people get shit for playing WoW?

1881
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:58,000
Anyway.

1882
01:59:58,000 --> 01:59:59,000
I played Gemstone.

1883
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:00,000
Gemstone 3.

1884
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:01,000
But anyway.

1885
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:04,000
Why don't you stop giving everybody shit and learn from your friends?

1886
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:05,000
We have another email.

1887
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:06,000
Oh, okay.

1888
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:09,000
Um, this comes from Robert M.

1889
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
Just seeing how you're doing.

1890
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:15,000
I was taken by surprise Tuesday morning when Animal Crossing Pocket Camp launched.

1891
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:20,000
I'm having frequent connection issues which are hopefully server side.

1892
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:21,000
Launch window jitters.

1893
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:22,000
Certainly having fun with it.

1894
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
And yes, that should have been resolved by now.

1895
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
I haven't had any disconnects.

1896
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
Oh yeah, we actually, we never got around to it.

1897
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:32,000
We never got around to it, but it was, uh, the link in the kickoff story was about those issues.

1898
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:38,000
Nintendo did apologize for it and they changed the timing of some things and gave everybody 20 leaf tickets.

1899
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:39,000
How about that?

1900
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:42,000
Alright.

1901
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
Woo! 20 tickets!

1902
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
That'll buy you an extra storage slot.

1903
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
Can you give us our virtual console?

1904
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:54,000
Also, I see the Transformer site I follow has news on an upcoming crossover with Street Fighter.

1905
02:00:54,000 --> 02:01:00,000
Yes, these are exciting figure, uh, existing figures redecode as characters from the game.

1906
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:06,000
A deluxe-sized two-pack of Generations RC is Chun-Li with Titan's return Hot Rod as Ken.

1907
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:15,000
Then a Voyager set of, uh, TR Optimus Prime slash Convoy as Ryu versus, uh, TR Megatron as M. Bison's Las Vegas.

1908
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:19,000
These are, from what I gathered, limited edition Japanese releases from Takara Tomy.

1909
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:24,000
I looked at the Chun-Li and I'm like, shit, why didn't I buy an RC?

1910
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:30,000
The only thing that I would really want would be another Hot Rod to add to my collection of 50 million other Hot Rods.

1911
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:35,000
I think I have, like, three Rodimus Primes and seven Hot Rods from various collections.

1912
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
So, it'd have to go to my collection.

1913
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,000
And Dan would be like, oh, it's Ken, that's cool.

1914
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:47,000
Um, P.S. I do sometimes pronounce the merch company as Ta-Takerotemi.

1915
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:50,000
Okay, but Takara Tomy, anyway.

1916
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:55,000
Um, like a surgical procedure, but only in jest.

1917
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:58,000
We say silly things sometimes, like, don't we always call Squarey-

1918
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:04,000
Oh, he's saying Ta-ka-rota-me, like it would be a surgical pr- that's funny, huh.

1919
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:05,000
Takara-ta-me.

1920
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:06,000
Takara-ta-me.

1921
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:07,000
I don't know.

1922
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:08,000
Ta-pa-ra-ma-nee. I don't know.

1923
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:16,000
Um, I- I've probably spent a lot of money at HobbyLink Japan when I was in the height of my-

1924
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:19,000
I need every single Hot Rod figure that's- I've got, like, a Canadian one, Ab-Japanese one-

1925
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:22,000
Responsible income is awesome. I don't need to save.

1926
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:26,000
Well, this- actually, I bought- my Hot Rod collection comes from spite.

1927
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:37,000
Because, when I was a kid, my mother, and she'll deny it to this day, she's like, girls don't play with Transformers, I'll get you another Barbie.

1928
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:42,000
Mother, I need to see Optimus Prime die, you don't understand.

1929
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:45,000
You don't need to go see that boys movie.

1930
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
So I snuck to go see it anyway.

1931
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:48,000
Of course you did.

1932
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:49,000
And I sobbed.

1933
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:52,000
And then I was like, fucking A, Hot Rod's cool.

1934
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:59,000
And that also kind of started my obsession with, um, uh, what's this fuck?

1935
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:02,000
Great, now I can see him in the Breakfast Club and I can't think of his name.

1936
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:03,000
Emilio Estevez?

1937
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:04,000
No, not Emilio Estevez.

1938
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:05,000
Judd Nelson?

1939
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:06,000
Judd Nelson.

1940
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:07,000
Judd Nelson was Hot Rod's voice.

1941
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:13,000
Also, Orson- that was Orson Welles' last role was Unicron in that movie.

1942
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:14,000
Leonard Nimoy-

1943
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:17,000
I'm sorry, but that is just the quintessential Jamie growing up story.

1944
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:18,000
Leonard Nimoy was in that too.

1945
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:19,000
Yes, I did.

1946
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:20,000
As Galvatron.

1947
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:21,000
Yes.

1948
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:22,000
But anyway, yes.

1949
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:27,000
So I, as an adult, I had a whole shitload of Transformers and a bunch of Hot Rods.

1950
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:32,000
I have, like, a couple of Starscreams and we have all the Binaltech- a lot of the Binaltech ones.

1951
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:38,000
All my stuff- now, see, I was not, you know, don't bring your stereotypes into this because

1952
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
I was not into Barbies or any of that stuff.

1953
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:45,000
I was always into the very, like, Lego- I'm into all the stuff that Loki's into now.

1954
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
That was the stuff I was into when I was a kid.

1955
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,000
Legos, especially.

1956
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,000
Uh, constructs.

1957
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:54,000
Tinkertoys were the shit.

1958
02:03:54,000 --> 02:04:00,000
My grandma had- I don't know if you ever saw these, but she had Tinkertoys that were, like,

1959
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:01,000
adult-sized Tinkertoys.

1960
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:02,000
Oh, shit.

1961
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:03,000
That's cool!

1962
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:08,000
Like, they had, like, the largest polar they had was, like, a good four or five feet long.

1963
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:13,000
And, like, the plast- like, the actual piece- the little round wood things that you plug

1964
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:19,000
them into were, like, the size of, I don't know, like, a small wheelbarrow tire or something like that.

1965
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:20,000
Oh, that's cool.

1966
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
It was, like, we used to build, like, Fords out of that shit.

1967
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:27,000
Or just use the large green pieces as, like, bow staffs because we pretended that it shows.

1968
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:28,000
Do they still make Tinkertoys?

1969
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:29,000
Or is that-

1970
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:30,000
They have-

1971
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:31,000
It's probably cheap-ass-

1972
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:32,000
It's all plastic.

1973
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:33,000
Fuck-ass plastic.

1974
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:34,000
It's plastic shit.

1975
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:35,000
No, no, no, no.

1976
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,000
Tinkertoys are made of wood.

1977
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:41,000
But, when I was a kid, though, I also really super-loved Lincoln Logs.

1978
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:47,000
And I would combine my Lincoln Logs and Tinkertoys to make, like, this elaborate death trap for

1979
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
all my Barbies.

1980
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,000
I'll show you playing with Barbies.

1981
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:54,000
Do you wanna play a game?

1982
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:58,000
And no one- and no one could come in my room because these labyrinths would spawn-

1983
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:01,000
The minute the door opened, an elaborate death trap would behead Barbie.

1984
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:02,000
Up on the bed.

1985
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:07,000
And, finally, I think just, like, they got, you know, broken and thrown away because I

1986
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:10,000
kept, you know, making it unsafe to navigate my bedroom.

1987
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:14,000
But my all-time favorite was Domino Rally.

1988
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
Yes, yes, yes.

1989
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:17,000
They sell that now.

1990
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:18,000
They do.

1991
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
Dirt is dirt fucking cheap.

1992
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:21,000
I almost bought it.

1993
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:24,000
And I was like, Rob, you don't have kids.

1994
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:25,000
You know what else is-

1995
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:26,000
Who cares?

1996
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:27,000
Who cares?

1997
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:28,000
What else is also cheap?

1998
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:33,000
Like, I remember, like, back when I had, like, uh, K'Nex or whatever, and I only really had

1999
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:37,000
one set of that, but, like, I remember the K'Nex roller coasters were, like, so fucking,

2000
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:38,000
like, expensive and elaborate.

2001
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
Now they're so cheap.

2002
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:43,000
And Mouse Trap was the best board game ever.

2003
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:44,000
Yeah, that was pretty fun.

2004
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:45,000
Yeah.

2005
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:46,000
Anyway.

2006
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:47,000
Alright.

2007
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:48,000
Uh.

2008
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:49,000
That's it for emails.

2009
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:50,000
That's it for emails.

2010
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
Boy, did we get on some tangents with those emails tonight.

2011
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:53,000
Okay.

2012
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:57,000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you wanna send this show into a Barbie death trap

2013
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:58,000
spiral.

2014
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
In the meantime-

2015
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:03,000
I was just an imaginative, creative child.

2016
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:04,000
Yes you were.

2017
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:05,000
Yes you were.

2018
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:08,000
Alright, let's get into some other gaming news.

2019
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:11,000
Speaking of robots, right, Loki?

2020
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:12,000
Yes.

2021
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:18,000
Ironically enough, I am looking at a picture of a robot, but, um, not anything to do with

2022
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:19,000
this article.

2023
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:23,000
So, um, Valve is changing the way their review system works.

2024
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:29,000
The stop from, um, having bots basically manipulate that system.

2025
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:35,000
So, they've, I guess, having a problem with, I guess, um, bot brigade- bot brigading on

2026
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,000
certain games.

2027
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:41,000
And, um, including, I guess, anti-review bomb charts and stuff like that that they've added,

2028
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:43,000
um, in recent updates.

2029
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:47,000
But now they're kind of trying to do some additional stuff with that.

2030
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:51,000
First, of course, they've acknowledged saying that, you know, basically that there's a small

2031
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:58,000
group to manipulate reviews to a degree that is clearly decreasing the value of Steam for

2032
02:06:58,000 --> 02:06:59,000
many other players.

2033
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
And to solve this problem, they're doing a couple things.

2034
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:06,000
First, the helpful ratings from the accounts, um, that are far outside the norm will be

2035
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:10,000
weighed differently than those of regular, presumably human users.

2036
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:16,000
Accounts that rate an excessive number of reviews on games will see the weight of each

2037
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:20,000
review rating count for less and less.

2038
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:26,000
Um, that's kind of lame if they- if there's someone that's actually reviewing games.

2039
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:31,000
I would think that- can you review games that you don't buy on Steam?

2040
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:35,000
I think you used to be able to, but not anymore.

2041
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:41,000
If you're gifted the code, then it actually puts a disclaimer by your little review that says

2042
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:44,000
a code was provided by the publisher or something like that.

2043
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
So that whole like disclaimer is up front.

2044
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:50,000
I don't believe you can review a game that you haven't played because it also shows right

2045
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:53,000
underneath it how many hours you've put into the game.

2046
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:54,000
True.

2047
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:55,000
Let me ask this question.

2048
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:58,000
I just want to ask this general question of our chat room.

2049
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:05,000
Have you ever been influenced on buying a video game or not based on like user reviews

2050
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:06,000
on Steam?

2051
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:07,000
Have you really?

2052
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:11,000
Well, yeah, because like, especially like if I'm looking to purchase a game and I see

2053
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:14,000
a bunch of negative reviews for it and I start reading them and it's like, oh yeah,

2054
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:19,000
the DRM is causing issues of the game or blah, blah, blah is causing issues of the game.

2055
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:27,000
Like for example, South Park, you know, of this fractured butthole on PC is kind of broken,

2056
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:30,000
I think, unless they've patched that recently.

2057
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:34,000
But it came out kind of broken because of the DRM in there and is buggy.

2058
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:37,000
And so that's one of the reasons I guess I didn't purchase it on Steam.

2059
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:42,000
But it's good to know those kind of things are like, you know, other issues where, you

2060
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:46,000
know, the performance might not be as good or especially games I'm not familiar with

2061
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
and I may see something like, oh, that looks really cool.

2062
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:53,000
And I read the reviews and there's usually I read more like in depth to see what they're

2063
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:56,000
trying to say and see if there's a common consensus across them.

2064
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:59,000
If it's just like, all right, fucking hate this.

2065
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000
You know, there's a lot of people that will just hate on anything.

2066
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
So it's hard to say.

2067
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:04,000
Let's see.

2068
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:05,000
Comments from chat.

2069
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:08,000
SSG100Matt says, sounds like this is mostly to curb downvote protests.

2070
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
Oh, for sure.

2071
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:11,000
Absolutely.

2072
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:16,000
Other comments from chat asking or answering my question about, do you get swayed by these?

2073
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:17,000
I'm actually kind of surprised.

2074
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:19,000
It sounds like most people are saying yes.

2075
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,000
JD says, yeah, sometimes.

2076
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:27,000
MegaManX400 says, if the user reviews are overwhelmingly poor, then yes.

2077
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:31,000
Fifth Dream says, yes, if people say it's technically shit or really, really crappy.

2078
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:36,000
MXC says, I'll look at Steam reviews to gauge how long a game is.

2079
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:41,000
Don't have time for a lot of super long stuff, so I generally seek out shorter titles.

2080
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:42,000
Interesting.

2081
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:46,000
SquatchKilla says, I use reviews on new games mostly.

2082
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:50,000
If they get bad reviews, I might buy them later discounted.

2083
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:56,000
So weighing if this is a buy it now or wait for a Steam sale sort of situation.

2084
02:09:56,000 --> 02:10:00,000
So, wow, I guess I'm different in that regard.

2085
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:05,000
I will use user reviews like friends on Twitter, people I know,

2086
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:10,000
but I tend not to let randos on Steam influence my decision

2087
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:13,000
because I know all these fucking campaigns are run all the time.

2088
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:14,000
Right.

2089
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:19,000
I was actually kind of surprised to see a lot of you do use that.

2090
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,000
Now I feel weird.

2091
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:24,000
Well, why do you feel weird about it?

2092
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:25,000
No, I don't know.

2093
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:29,000
I thought everybody kind of took the Yelp approach to Steam

2094
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:32,000
where it's like, oh, you're only ever going to read the bad stuff.

2095
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
That's how Yelp is to me.

2096
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:37,000
Like you either somebody went to Yelp because they're like,

2097
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:40,000
no, I have 300 friends on my Facebook.

2098
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
I'm going to slander your company to me and, you know,

2099
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:46,000
write something negative on Facebook or Yelp or whatever.

2100
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:50,000
Or it's the fucking owner's friend and they wrote a five star review.

2101
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:54,000
Like you very rarely find the honest shit in between on those sites.

2102
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:58,000
So like I don't pay attention to a lot of those, that stuff.

2103
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:01,000
And so I kind of have that attitude with video games.

2104
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:04,000
I'm like everything is either a hundred percent or zero percent

2105
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:07,000
and it's never truly in between.

2106
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:08,000
But again, it's personal.

2107
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:11,000
I'm not, you know, that's why I asked the question.

2108
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:13,000
I wanted to see what you guys kind of did with that.

2109
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:16,000
So let's see.

2110
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:20,000
Oh, SSU100Matt in chat says, I wrote a negative Yelp review on a mechanic

2111
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:23,000
and I got bribed to take it down by the shop.

2112
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:28,000
See, I use Yelp to find places that are open

2113
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
because they have business hours listed in there.

2114
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
That's the most I use Yelp for.

2115
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:33,000
I don't read reviews anymore.

2116
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:35,000
There's too much fuckery that goes on.

2117
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:39,000
Well, not always because like my wife left a negative Yelp review yesterday

2118
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:41,000
for Chinese places that we went to.

2119
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:44,000
And she looked at it, you know, because I guess the food,

2120
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:47,000
we've been there before and the food's been good.

2121
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:52,000
And then lately she got it and like they were skimping on all the like meat

2122
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:56,000
and then the like shrimp that she took a bite of the shrimp in the soup.

2123
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
She's like, ah, that shrimp is not good, you know?

2124
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:02,000
And she called up to let them know, hey, your shrimp is probably bad.

2125
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:05,000
They no apology, not even concerned.

2126
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:08,000
They're just like me and just like kind of brushed her off.

2127
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
And she's like, well, I'm going to leave a review then.

2128
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:14,000
And like last six months, there's been a ton of negative reviews from place

2129
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
probably because it's like on our new ownership or something.

2130
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
So it's good to kind of gauge it.

2131
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
But yeah, I mean, people were only right views

2132
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
if they have something negative to say for the most part.

2133
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:23,000
I mean, so I don't know.

2134
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:25,000
So I always take that stuff with a grain of salt.

2135
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:26,000
That's just, that's just me.

2136
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
Anyway, uh, let's move on.

2137
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:32,000
As Joe and Matt wanted to make it clear, I didn't take the bait.

2138
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
All right. All right. All right.

2139
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:35,000
Let's move on.

2140
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:38,000
Oh, hey, I actually have news to talk about in Pokemon Go,

2141
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
even though I think we've kind of already addressed this.

2142
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:43,000
But if you didn't know, there was this big event going on in Pokemon Go

2143
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:48,000
called the Global Catch Challenge, where basically Niantic was daring you

2144
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:51,000
to catch 3 billion Pokemon in a week.

2145
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:54,000
And did they do it? Yes, they did.

2146
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:58,000
So the players of Pokemon Go did catch 3 billion Pokemon,

2147
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:04,000
which unlocked Double XP, Double Stardust for, I think, till December 1st.

2148
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:11,000
And the biggest one of all, Farfetch'd, the bird that's carrying the leak,

2149
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:15,000
has been unleashed worldwide for 48 hours.

2150
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:19,000
So that means you have about 24 more hours to catch a Farfetch'd

2151
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:20,000
if you haven't already got one.

2152
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:23,000
And they, they have been spawning on my house.

2153
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:25,000
So maybe I'm checking right now. Yeah.

2154
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:27,000
Yeah. I checked my house.

2155
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:30,000
I'm not going to go out to try to catch one, but you know.

2156
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
But if you do, you only have 24 more hours to do it.

2157
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:35,000
But they're, they're not, at least I know I'm not sleeping.

2158
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,000
They're not terribly hard to find.

2159
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:41,000
Like they are, they're spawning about as common as, as the, uh,

2160
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:46,000
Shuppets on like those dust skulls were fucking everywhere.

2161
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:49,000
The Shuppets were plentiful, but not everywhere.

2162
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:50,000
That's kind of where Farfetch'd is at.

2163
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:51,000
I just caught a Pikachu.

2164
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:53,000
Well, Pikachu spawn on my house all the time.

2165
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:54,000
I don't know why.

2166
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
He's on a Pikachu nest.

2167
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
No, but it's not even a nest because nests rotate.

2168
02:13:58,000 --> 02:13:59,000
Right.

2169
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:00,000
So I don't know what it is.

2170
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
They must know that nerds live here.

2171
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:03,000
So we get Pikachu all the time.

2172
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:05,000
So there you go.

2173
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:09,000
Maybe that's my reward for playing so much fucking Ingress in Pokemon Go.

2174
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:10,000
Niantic knows me personally.

2175
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:12,000
And puts Pikachu on my house.

2176
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:13,000
That's my little.

2177
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:15,000
This is Rob's house and we're going to put all the Pikas there.

2178
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:18,000
If that's good, how about a fucking shiny Pikachu then?

2179
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
Cause that's the one thing I don't have.

2180
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:21,000
Are there shinies?

2181
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:25,000
Yeah, they have like a gray thing on their tail instead of it being like black.

2182
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:26,000
Very few.

2183
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:30,000
Uh, Pikachu has a shiny in Pokemon Go.

2184
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:31,000
That is in the regular series.

2185
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:33,000
Obviously most everything does with some exceptions.

2186
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:38,000
Uh, in Pokemon Go, the gen three Halloween all have shinies.

2187
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:42,000
So, Shuppet, Duskull, and, um, Sableye.

2188
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
Uh, Pikachu has a shiny.

2189
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
Magikarp has a shiny.

2190
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:47,000
I think that's it.

2191
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,000
I feel like there might be one other I'm forgetting.

2192
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:51,000
But those are all the shinies that exist in the game right now.

2193
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:52,000
So.

2194
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:53,000
Alright.

2195
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:55,000
Uh, but there you go.

2196
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:56,000
So Farfetch'd was unlocked.

2197
02:14:56,000 --> 02:15:04,000
And, um, oh, it wasn't just Farfetch'd because now if you lived in East Asia, Japan,

2198
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:11,000
where Farfetch'd was your local Pokemon, you'd feel pretty screwed that the whole world got, you know, your Pokemon.

2199
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:16,000
Well, they got Kangaskhan in exchange, which was the Australia exclusive.

2200
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:20,000
So, they, Asia got some of this too so that they got something that was new to them.

2201
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:21,000
So, there you go.

2202
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:28,000
Although, if you were lucky enough to be in Anaheim for Pokemon Worlds, you may also have a Kangaskhan living in the US.

2203
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:32,000
So, the only one that has not been released in the US at this point is Mr. Mime.

2204
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
So, we'll see.

2205
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:36,000
Alright.

2206
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:37,000
Mr. Mime!

2207
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:38,000
Okay.

2208
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:39,000
Not Mr. Smoosh, but Mr. Mime.

2209
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:40,000
Mr. Smoosh is cuter.

2210
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:41,000
That's right.

2211
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:42,000
Mr. Smoosh is way cuter and so-

2212
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
We like his little face.

2213
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:50,000
A few more stories before we open up the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

2214
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:55,000
If you have the Skype app, you can just add Orange Lounge Radio and give us a call in a little bit.

2215
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:58,000
Or, of course, the desktop version works too.

2216
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:02,000
And I think it's like fucking built into Windows 10, isn't it, so everybody has Skype.

2217
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:03,000
Yes.

2218
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:04,000
You can't really-

2219
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:05,000
Guess who's not on Windows?

2220
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:06,000
Your Xbox has it.

2221
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:07,000
Sorry.

2222
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:08,000
I meant to set up the laptop.

2223
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:09,000
I haven't forgotten.

2224
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:10,000
I just-

2225
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
That actually wasn't a read on that whole thing.

2226
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:13,000
I forgot about that too.

2227
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:14,000
I know.

2228
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:15,000
Alright.

2229
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:16,000
Anyhow.

2230
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:17,000
Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

2231
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:20,000
Number one, people need to stop posting articles about cookie butter.

2232
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:24,000
Did you know that that's like the Oreo flavor right now is cookie butter Oreos?

2233
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:25,000
What?

2234
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:27,000
It's a cookie already.

2235
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:28,000
You don't need cookie butter.

2236
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:31,000
No, cookie butter is fucking magical.

2237
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:35,000
My favorite was when Oreo had the cookies and cream flavored Oreo.

2238
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:38,000
I was like, did they feed the cow beef?

2239
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:41,000
It's meta Oreo.

2240
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:42,000
Anyway.

2241
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:43,000
I heard you like Oreos.

2242
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,000
Here's your Oreo in your Oreo.

2243
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:47,000
This is why I love our chat room.

2244
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:48,000
Like I said earlier in the show-

2245
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
Did anyone buy any Prongles during the break?

2246
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
Once you pop, that's great.

2247
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:53,000
No.

2248
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:55,000
So, this is why I love our chatters.

2249
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:59,000
Even though I said earlier in the show, we'll never be famous, but we have a great turnout here.

2250
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:03,000
Is because everybody's like, oh no, cookie butter is serious shit.

2251
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:05,000
Cookie butter is the shit.

2252
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:08,000
And fifth dream ask, is cookie butter a white person thing?

2253
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:09,000
I don't know.

2254
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:13,000
Cookie butter has been out in Europe for quite a while.

2255
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:14,000
It's from Belgium.

2256
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:21,000
It's called Speculoos along with our, what was the other thing from Belgium that we had?

2257
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,000
The Stroke Waffle.

2258
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:30,000
But it's basically just this buttery, delicious cookie paste.

2259
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
By the way, can we talk about Stroke Waffle for a minute?

2260
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
Stroke Waffle.

2261
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:37,000
Because, yeah, I know I mispronounced it, but I don't care.

2262
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:43,000
I opened the mail this week and I have a big envelope in the mail and it's kind of thick.

2263
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:45,000
I'm like, what the hell did somebody send me in the mail?

2264
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:49,000
And it's from Ranma, our good pal Ranma who calls into the show frequently.

2265
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:51,000
And I'm like, what the hell is this?

2266
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:55,000
And so I open it up, I open up the first envelope, there's another envelope inside it.

2267
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:59,000
And I'm like, I swear to God, this is one of the things where you keep like, it's like the Russian dolls.

2268
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:03,000
You keep opening the box and I get to the middle and there's just a middle finger printed out on it.

2269
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:06,000
I'm gonna be so mad. I'm gonna fly out to New York and beat him up.

2270
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
But it was a much better ending.

2271
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:16,000
So inside the second envelope were tiny little miniature Stroke Waffles that I think he got in, still in the wrapper,

2272
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:19,000
that I think he got at some anime convention or someplace that he was at.

2273
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:22,000
He fucking mailed me Stroke Waffles.

2274
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:25,000
And again, this is why I love our listeners, especially Ranma.

2275
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:31,000
Well, I told you my friend in Belgium who I met through Dragon Age fan fiction.

2276
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:36,000
We did a food exchange. I sent her Pop-Tarts and she sent me like the packaged sugar waffles.

2277
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:40,000
That's what they fucking want in Europe and Netherlands and everything on the other side of the pond.

2278
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
They want the fucking Pop-Tarts.

2279
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:45,000
I sent like Orange Crush Pop-Tarts.

2280
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:47,000
Well, yeah, because they don't have anything but like strawberry and blueberry.

2281
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:49,000
We have all the weird shit.

2282
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:51,000
I basically sent a gift of diabetes.

2283
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:53,000
Anyway.

2284
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:55,000
So, story.

2285
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:57,000
Oh, yes. Where were we?

2286
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:59,000
Super Nintendo World!

2287
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:03,000
So there's a few more details for Universal Studios in Florida.

2288
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:08,000
The area for the Super Nintendo World is going to be 8.8 acres in size

2289
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:14,000
and will be built behind Simpsons Land in where currently the kid zone is.

2290
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
The E.T. ride will stay there.

2291
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:19,000
There will be 48 toilets in total.

2292
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:21,000
It will take about 3 years to build.

2293
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:28,000
And it will be open sometime just after Japan's Universal Studios Nintendo Park opens.

2294
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:33,000
There are sections mentioned for Donkey Kong and Mario Kart.

2295
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:37,000
Both of which will be in both parks.

2296
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
So, um.

2297
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
Yes, act deft.

2298
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:45,000
I still would like some Not Nutella Oreos again, please.

2299
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:47,000
Theme park.

2300
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:50,000
I'm not going to be able to eat this stuff before too long.

2301
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:51,000
I know.

2302
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:53,000
Sad face.

2303
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:55,000
Give me all the candy!

2304
02:19:55,000 --> 02:20:00,000
So there was also a Twitter post by Chip Scambis.

2305
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:04,000
Who, um, I don't know where he factors into it.

2306
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
Maybe he is.

2307
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:09,000
He is a designer at Universal.

2308
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:18,000
And he was saying that they are going to do a dining area with a total seating capacity of 365 seats as well.

2309
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
What kind of Nintendo food?

2310
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
Are they going to bring back Nintendo cereal?

2311
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:26,000
I'm fucking there if I can go buy Nintendo cereal at one of the food carts.

2312
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
What if we have conga churros?

2313
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:29,000
What if...

2314
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:32,000
What if they did banana lumpia?

2315
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:39,000
What if they did those milkshakes, but instead of Froot Loops or whatever, they put Nintendo cereal in it?

2316
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:43,000
Or what if they have Star Cupcakes?

2317
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:45,000
But no, what if they just did banana milkshakes?

2318
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:46,000
Anyway.

2319
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
Donkey Kong banana milkshakes.

2320
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
Banana milkshakes are the fucking best.

2321
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:53,000
It doesn't matter what we talk about. It just evolves into food.

2322
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:55,000
But those maple cookies were good.

2323
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:56,000
Yes, they were.

2324
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
Okay. That's it.

2325
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
Well, when are they going to...

2326
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:03,000
When are they going to, excuse me, open this place? I want to go.

2327
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:05,000
I didn't find that.

2328
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:07,000
They said it was a few years.

2329
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:09,000
They said it should take about three years to construct.

2330
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:11,000
Don't die, please.

2331
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:15,000
I think the last thing I read was Japan is supposed to have theirs just before the Olympics in 2020.

2332
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:19,000
And then everybody else gets theirs shortly after, so that wouldn't surprise me.

2333
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:20,000
Yeah.

2334
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:23,000
Don't die, Rob.

2335
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:26,000
Just a few more stories and then we'll get to the Skype line. Loki.

2336
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:31,000
Alright. So apparently, there's more Kickstarter shenanigans.

2337
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:35,000
So there's a developer of this game called Project Phoenix.

2338
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:44,000
I guess the director of that is being accused of embezzling one million dollars from the Kickstarter campaign.

2339
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:50,000
So apparently, yes, it starts off with the game developer, Tariq Lacy,

2340
02:21:50,000 --> 02:22:02,000
has accused the director, Hiroaki Yura, of stealing money from the Kickstarter of Project Phoenix to fund his latest game, Tiny Metal.

2341
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:07,000
And basically saying that the...

2342
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:19,000
And of course, Yura is making his own allegations saying that, you know, Lacy is accusing Lacy of sexual harassment, which of course they deny.

2343
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:22,000
And it's basically back and forth and that type of thing.

2344
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:27,000
So there is... I guess this has been quite a long project.

2345
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:30,000
It first popped up in 2013.

2346
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:41,000
And I guess since then, you know, it's raised over one million dollars from about 15... almost 16,000 backers.

2347
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:46,000
And then 2015, so the game would be delayed for another three years.

2348
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:51,000
And in April 2017, told the backers that he planned to release a different game first.

2349
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:59,000
He explained that he had found some investors who would be willing to help back Project Phoenix if his new game succeeded.

2350
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:06,000
And that new game was Tiny Metal, which I guess is scheduled to release December 21st.

2351
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:12,000
And now, of course, you know, it just seems like this stuff keeps getting pushed back and pushed back.

2352
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:20,000
So he went and turned to Facebook to basically kind of accuse Yura's company of running a scam.

2353
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:29,000
So basically said, two months after I was hired to Area 35, I had learned that the company funded this project by running a scam through Kickstarter.

2354
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:39,000
They gathered several famous creators and ran a campaign known as Project Phoenix, then used the one million dollars received from the campaign to fund Tiny Metal project.

2355
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:48,000
Here's how it happened. After they received the Kickstarter money for Project Phoenix, they shut down the original company, Creative Intelligent Arts, or CIA,

2356
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:55,000
and then used the same money to establish Area 35 and pay for staff equipment and the office to make Tiny Metal.

2357
02:23:55,000 --> 02:24:07,000
And I guess the company's CEO asked me to deflect any accusations that this money was from any other companies or other than private investors.

2358
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:21,000
In actuality, Hiroaki only dipped into his own funds and asked for money from private investors after funding what he had secured for Tiny Metal was running low.

2359
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:25,000
I don't know. This is kind of why I stay away from Kickstarter.

2360
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:31,000
This is why, yeah, I'm kind of like over Kickstarter at this point, which is a bummer because there's a lot of people out there that are using it legitimately.

2361
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:39,000
But there's just, there's too much fuckery going. This is the theme of the night, fuckery. There's too much fuckery going on on Kickstarter, kind of like this stuff.

2362
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:52,000
I want to just quickly say dungeonbuster in our chat at live.fognetwork.com says, just for context, Divinity Original Sin and its sequel have been released in the time Project Phoenix Kickstarter started, ended, and ran into problems, and is still not done.

2363
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:57,000
I'm still waiting for blood-stained ritual tonight.

2364
02:24:57,000 --> 02:25:00,000
True, but we at least have seen something playable of that.

2365
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:06,000
Yeah, and I know I'm not going to get swindled on that, but it's like, you know, we sometimes forget when we back these Kickstarters.

2366
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:10,000
It takes a long fucking time to make a video game, don't it, Loki?

2367
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:13,000
Well, it helps if you're actually working on the game.

2368
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:15,000
It sure does, yes.

2369
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:20,000
It sure does. Or know which game you're actually working on because, you know, there's that too.

2370
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:24,000
Anyway, we're about to open up the Skype line. Give us a call if you want.

2371
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, and you can talk to us about anything we've talked about tonight, or maybe you have something different.

2372
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:34,000
While we wait for some calls to come in, I got one more story for you guys here.

2373
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:39,000
Oh god, it's another loot box story, but this one is very tongue-in-cheek. I like this.

2374
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:48,000
It's a mod for the original Doom that turns it into Doom with loot boxes.

2375
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:52,000
It's a tongue-in-cheek third-party mod that makes some adjustments to gameplay.

2376
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:57,000
It removes weapons and power-ups on the map, and you get a UAC crate instead.

2377
02:25:57,000 --> 02:26:06,000
To open the crate, you need a key, which you have a chance of obtaining randomly with every enemy kill, or, of course, you can go into the shop and buy keys.

2378
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:14,000
Although, since the whole thing is a joke, it just says the servers are down if you try to actually buy any particular key, and that's it.

2379
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:26,000
So, there you go. So, with the keys that you can find, rarely you might get a shotgun, but you probably won't get that rocket launcher or BFG or the stuff you really need to beat Doom.

2380
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:32,000
Anyway, there's a popular YouTube video showing this off out there by a user from ZDoomForums.

2381
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:40,000
The username is stronkytonky is the user that put out this YouTube video where you can see him just get really frustrated at this.

2382
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:44,000
He does finally find 10 keys after 600 kills.

2383
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:50,000
Anyway, obviously the whole thing is supposed to be very tongue-in-cheek and a parody of the whole loot box thing, but it does kind of make you wonder,

2384
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:55,000
God, where could this industry be right now if people had figured this out a while ago?

2385
02:26:55,000 --> 02:27:06,000
I guess we should be thankful that the 14.4K modem speeds we had back in the day that Doom was released, probably not fast enough to run loot boxes.

2386
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:10,000
Well, here's the other thing, too, since we're talking about loot boxes.

2387
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:16,000
So, there was an article that was on Polygon talking about Battlefront 2, and so what's going on with Battlefront 2 now?

2388
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:19,000
People are AFK grinding this stuff, and so they're doing-

2389
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:21,000
Oh, yeah, so somebody built like a contraption.

2390
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:29,000
Yeah, there's a few things. So, there's someone that built it like a robot to kind of push buttons and move the stick and stuff like that randomly.

2391
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:37,000
And then there's just people that are using rubber bands to move the analog sticks so that they run around in a circle or something like that.

2392
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:49,000
And so, yeah, that's got to hurt the game as well because now people are basically just doing that, and you're getting in games with people that are AFK, and so that kind of sucks.

2393
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:53,000
So, of course people are going to cheat the system like that because they feel it's unfair.

2394
02:27:53,000 --> 02:28:03,000
Well, and now, I mean, for better or for worse, depending on your opinions on this whole thing, Battlefront 2 has become like the kick box.

2395
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:04,000
The dead horse?

2396
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:08,000
Yeah, just the thing that everybody just beats up on as the symbol of-

2397
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:09,000
The scapegoat.

2398
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:12,000
Yeah, the scapegoat. The goat simulator.

2399
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:13,000
Hey, goat simulator is awesome.

2400
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:21,000
No, yeah, goat simulator is awesome, but I think of some of those scenes of goat simulator with the goat flinging through the air with those rubber band physics and stuff.

2401
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:29,000
That's what EA's Battlefront game has become with this whole loot box thing is it's now everybody's kicking boy or whatever. What do they call it? Kicking dog? I don't know.

2402
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:30,000
Whipping boy.

2403
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:37,000
Whipping boy. That's it. Whipping boy is what this game has become. So, I mean, of course everybody's going to try to exploit it.

2404
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:46,000
If you want to exploit our Skype line, OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word, you can give us a call right now. I'll check in with Loki, see if he has any other last minute stories.

2405
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:47,000
This was kind of a slower news week.

2406
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:49,000
Yeah, I don't.

2407
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:51,000
I'm kind of surprised we filled the show.

2408
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:58,000
There's all the different sales. I didn't pick anything up on the Steam sales, although I was tempted to, but I've already bought enough games recently.

2409
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:10,000
This is the first year I'm like, or the first sale. I'm not really motivated to finish the badge either. Like you have to go in and nominate a game in any, every category and they're meaningless awards. And I'm just like, eh.

2410
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:13,000
I picked up a couple, but I forgot what I got.

2411
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:17,000
I haven't bought anything. I don't know. I need to go back and look at the list.

2412
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:20,000
Ooh, I got picked for a Valve hardware survey. Ooh.

2413
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:22,000
Are they going to send you a free Steam box?

2414
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:24,000
Probably not. I already have one.

2415
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:27,000
They started, they practically started giving those things away at some point.

2416
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:31,000
I paid five for mine. Yeah.

2417
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:32,000
I got mine for a dollar.

2418
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:33,000
I don't want to tell you how much I paid for mine.

2419
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:35,000
I'd buy that for a dollar and I did.

2420
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:37,000
I got you your controller.

2421
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:45,000
I know. Yes, but I love the controller. The controller has that whole haptic feedback thing, which is in this phone too. And I love it.

2422
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:46,000
It's been in my phone for an age.

2423
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:47,000
Well, wait.

2424
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:49,000
It came out with a 6s.

2425
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:50,000
With a 6s.

2426
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:59,000
But the controller I have for my Apple TV, though, is crap. Now I can't think of what it's called either.

2427
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:06,000
But it's a really good controller and I want to see if it'll work with our Steam link because I have a few games on there that I want to start playing now.

2428
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:07,000
That'll be fun.

2429
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:08,000
I'll have to look up what I have.

2430
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:17,000
Yeah, I haven't got a chance to hook up my Steam link yet. Maybe I'll leave that this week because I was going to use it now for media streaming since we have in our little box.

2431
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:26,000
My wife was teasing me this week. She was like, oh, we can go get a 4K TV this week if you want. I'm like, okay.

2432
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:31,000
Well, the ones she was looking at really cheap. I was like, it needs to have HDR and all that stuff.

2433
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:36,000
And I'm like, man, if we get a 4K TV, then I've got to get PlayStation Pro and stuff like that.

2434
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,000
I don't want to spend that money.

2435
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:43,000
By the way, I have the SteelSeries Nimbus wireless gaming controller.

2436
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:46,000
I also have a SteelSeries controller.

2437
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:47,000
It is fairly comfortable.

2438
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:48,000
I do not.

2439
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:49,000
When do I get mine?

2440
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:51,000
Well, they're basically like an Xbox 360 controller.

2441
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:52,000
That's cool.

2442
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:57,000
But I think it feels a lot better put together. It's got a bit more heft in the hand, you know?

2443
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:58,000
Yes.

2444
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:05,000
Well, gosh, some folks in chat are talking about should be doing a live stream of the Doom loot box thing.

2445
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:08,000
I wish I'd thought of that before the show. That would've been a fun live stream to do tonight.

2446
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:10,000
I am going to do a live stream after the show tonight.

2447
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:13,000
I'm going to do my first time playing.

2448
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:16,000
I bought it earlier today because I knew I would buy it eventually.

2449
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:22,000
My first time playing Rocket League on Switch, which for those counting, this is now the third time.

2450
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,000
No, actually, I take that back.

2451
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,000
It's only the first time I've bought it.

2452
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:31,000
It's the third version I own, but it's the first time I've bought it because it was free on PlayStation Plus.

2453
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:34,000
It was gifted to me on Steam, so I bought it on Switch.

2454
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:38,000
So, yeah, I'm going to check out Rocket League after the show.

2455
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:43,000
So you can check that out on my Twitch channel over at Rob Roberts.

2456
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:49,000
I bought another $4 Switch game, too, and I might get into playing that as well.

2457
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:52,000
So we'll see. We'll do that.

2458
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:56,000
My kids, by the way, created their own YouTube channel.

2459
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:59,000
Did they really? Let me just put one more call for calls.

2460
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:02,000
I don't know if the Skype line is broken. I don't see anybody in chat complaining.

2461
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:04,000
But Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

2462
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
I'm getting set up to start vlogging.

2463
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:10,000
See, that blows my mind because you haven't wanted to do video.

2464
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:13,000
Because I can adjust the camera angle on my own vlog.

2465
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:17,000
I will put the camera. You can do whatever you want with it here.

2466
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:18,000
We'll see.

2467
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:19,000
All right. Okay.

2468
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:27,000
But I have a plan for how I want to do it, so it's basically things will happen.

2469
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:36,000
You totally need to go the route of Gendo, where he's just sitting there with the silhouette and the shine on his glasses.

2470
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,000
That's the way you need to do it.

2471
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:39,000
I could do that.

2472
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:41,000
It's Gendo.

2473
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:47,000
All right. Well, our Skype line is not lighting up tonight.

2474
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:52,000
I think we might. I mean, I don't check live listener numbers because I don't obsess over things like that anymore.

2475
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:57,000
But I could look at people that are checking in over at the Voice Geeks Network at vognetwork.com.

2476
02:32:57,000 --> 02:33:03,000
Because we have a system, kind of like Foursquare used to be, where you can actually check into shows and you get points.

2477
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:06,000
And you even get loot, not loot boxes, but loot.

2478
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:09,000
Just fun things for your vog network profile and stuff.

2479
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:14,000
And so I see, actually, we have more people checked in tonight than our last episode.

2480
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:18,000
But not as many as two weeks ago, or two shows ago.

2481
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:20,000
Did you know this?

2482
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:22,000
I would assume the holiday weekend where I just have a lower turnout.

2483
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:26,000
Did you know that Nier Automata is one of the games on the Steam sale right now?

2484
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:27,000
40% off?

2485
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:28,000
How much then?

2486
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:30,000
That makes it $35.99.

2487
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,000
I hear a lot of good things about that game.

2488
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:34,000
I'm considering it, but I just had my hair done.

2489
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,000
That's like Game of the Year level game.

2490
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:40,000
But Okami HD is also $20. It's not on sale, but it's just $20.

2491
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:43,000
There's another game, though, that's been kind of catching my interest.

2492
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:48,000
And I'm sure it's just pronounced Valhalla, but it's VA11 Hall A.

2493
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:51,000
Cyberpunk Bartender Action.

2494
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:55,000
The ROM 2064 guys support that a lot.

2495
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:58,000
Yeah, I've been considering getting that one.

2496
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:01,000
So if anyone's playing it, let me know what you think of it.

2497
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:06,000
Apparently I was looking at a page called Deep Space Waifu on Steam.

2498
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:09,000
I don't remember, I saw a link to that, but it's like 99 cents.

2499
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:12,000
And it kind of looks like it's a SHMUP game.

2500
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:17,000
It's like a SHMUP game with anime babes or something.

2501
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:18,000
Of course, because why not?

2502
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:21,000
I'm not really sure what the point of that is, but it looks silly.

2503
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:22,000
In cyanide sense.

2504
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:25,000
SquatchKilla in chat over at live.voggenetwork.com says,

2505
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:29,000
My son keeps asking to start a YouTube channel with myself.

2506
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:33,000
You know, hey, some people make a lot of money doing that stuff.

2507
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:35,000
Actually, should I say that?

2508
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:36,000
Ok, I'm going to say it.

2509
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:42,000
I have made my first threshold on Twitch where I'm getting a check.

2510
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:43,000
Huzzah!

2511
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:46,000
Yeah, I don't think I see it till next month.

2512
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:49,000
Which I have not been doing a lot of streaming lately.

2513
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:51,000
I was doing a lot of it when I was pushing first affiliate.

2514
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:53,000
I've really scaled back and I apologize to you guys.

2515
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:59,000
You guys just know I've had a really rough year and it's just hard for me to be extroverted several times throughout the week.

2516
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:01,000
And I think most of you guys kind of know that and I really appreciate it.

2517
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:06,000
I just feel like, oh god, I wish I could pull my shit together and do that more for the subscribers that I have.

2518
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:08,000
But it's hard.

2519
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:10,000
I would love to do that.

2520
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:12,000
I don't have a place to do that.

2521
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:14,000
I don't have the gear to do that.

2522
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:23,000
And going back to place to do that, I don't have a place that I can talk with where the sound isn't going to bother my wife.

2523
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:26,000
Or wake up my kids because it would have to be when they were asleep.

2524
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:28,000
Unless they're going to do stuff on it.

2525
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:31,000
We just don't have any room in the house to do that.

2526
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:35,000
And I would love to start that.

2527
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:37,000
I keep thinking about doing it in my garage.

2528
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:45,000
But it's not really climate controlled and it smells like cat box and it's dirty as fuck.

2529
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:47,000
I have an F.U.

2530
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:49,000
We don't have to have the music for it.

2531
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:54,000
F.U. to people who go on Steam and ask me for free games.

2532
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:56,000
Ask me to buy you a game.

2533
02:35:57,000 --> 02:35:59,000
I'm going to out this person right now.

2534
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:01,000
No, no, no. Don't do it.

2535
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:04,000
I'm going to out you on Twitter.

2536
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:06,000
If you do this again.

2537
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:09,000
The answer will always fucking be no.

2538
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:10,000
Interesting.

2539
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:12,000
If you're someone who I don't know who you are.

2540
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:16,000
Or you're just a random so and so on my list.

2541
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:18,000
Don't fucking ask me to buy you anything.

2542
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:20,000
Did you add somebody on the list who you kind of didn't know?

2543
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:23,000
I thought they were in the community.

2544
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:25,000
But they've been on there for a while.

2545
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:26,000
Interesting.

2546
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:29,000
So no, the answer is always going to be no.

2547
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:32,000
Unless like your birthday is coming up or something.

2548
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:35,000
Or I think you're an okay person.

2549
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:37,000
If you are just somebody on my friends list.

2550
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:39,000
The answer is always fucking no.

2551
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:40,000
Yeah. Okay.

2552
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:41,000
That's fair.

2553
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:42,000
Earn your own money.

2554
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:43,000
Gifts or gifts?

2555
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:45,000
Let's see. What was I going to say?

2556
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:46,000
I would give you money for food.

2557
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:48,000
But I'm not going to give you money for games.

2558
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:51,000
This stream in chat says I get a free sub from Amazon Prime.

2559
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:53,000
So I threw it at Rob's channel so he can get monies.

2560
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:54,000
Well, I really appreciate that.

2561
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:55,000
And I'll tell you what.

2562
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:57,000
The money is just going to go right back to OLR.

2563
02:36:57,000 --> 02:37:03,000
Well, I mean, Bobby and I kind of both have some costs that we pay for Vaga Network.

2564
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:07,000
So I actually pay for our radio feed that goes out there.

2565
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:10,000
Bobby takes care of all the website stuff and other stuff too.

2566
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:12,000
I'm drawing a very crude line.

2567
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:14,000
So the money is going to go right back into that.

2568
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:18,000
And we are looking at doing some upgrades here with Loki and talking about the laptop.

2569
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:22,000
I think when that happens, I think I will be.

2570
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:27,000
This mixing board has served us very well, but it has also served us for...

2571
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:29,000
I remember when we placed the first mixing board.

2572
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:34,000
This was 2006, this mixing board.

2573
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:37,000
Do you remember Dark Sakura when this mixing board came into play?

2574
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:40,000
It was, it wasn't cheap.

2575
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:44,000
Yeah. So we'll probably replace that with something instead of analog, something digital.

2576
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:45,000
I'm buying a game right now.

2577
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:46,000
Are you really?

2578
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:47,000
I'm buying 20XX.

2579
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:50,000
MXC points this out.

2580
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:57,000
One of my friends has like 5,000 games on Steam and Rando's used to ask him for free games before going private.

2581
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:59,000
Oh, maybe somebody can see the size of the library.

2582
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:00,000
That's kind of interesting.

2583
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:01,000
Well, fuck them.

2584
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:02,000
They just still know.

2585
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:05,000
You can ogle my library all you fucking want.

2586
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:07,000
Look, look and covet.

2587
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:15,000
I do technically have extra Steam keys for a lot of games because I bought so many bundles that I'm sitting on multiple copies of a lot of things.

2588
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:17,000
But I haven't really...

2589
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:19,000
But you'll do that on your terms when you want to get those out.

2590
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:20,000
Yeah.

2591
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:22,000
I'm sorry. I will be that stingy bitch.

2592
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:23,000
It's, it's fine.

2593
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:28,000
S2100 Mountain Chat says the mixing board survived the Drunami mixing board table destruction.

2594
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:31,000
Actually, I think that was the one before this.

2595
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:33,000
You remember the black mixing board we had?

2596
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:34,000
The old mixing...

2597
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:39,000
Okay, for those that have seen the YouTube, I know we're just rambling tonight, but this is what happens when you don't call.

2598
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:40,000
We ramble.

2599
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:44,000
So the black mixing board, you can, that's the old one.

2600
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:48,000
And you can actually see that in our rarely used YouTube channel.

2601
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:49,000
No, I take that back.

2602
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:51,000
We actually have a stock of back episodes on there.

2603
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:52,000
Jason was working very hard.

2604
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:53,000
I'll take it.

2605
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:56,000
It was in the, it was in the NBC, the channel three.

2606
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:58,000
Oh, it's so much fun video.

2607
02:38:58,000 --> 02:38:59,000
Yeah.

2608
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:03,000
Which is on YouTube on our orange lounge radio channel.

2609
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:04,000
That was the first mixing board.

2610
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:05,000
That was the black one.

2611
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:07,000
Now we have a gray one that Jamie just snapped a picture of.

2612
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:08,000
So maybe she's posting.

2613
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:09,000
It's going to go on my Insta.

2614
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:10,000
There you go.

2615
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:15,000
So, but we're looking at, at least I'm thinking about, cause you'll notice it's all analog.

2616
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:17,000
And so I'm thinking about something maybe more digital.

2617
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:18,000
So we'll see.

2618
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:24,000
Well, and I actually, I know we've talked about me having a second set up with my MacBook.

2619
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:27,000
You may take this and vlog away with it or whatever you want to do with it.

2620
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:30,000
Well, but it also would be good, I think, to have a fallback for travel.

2621
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:34,000
Cause I can just, you know, we've tested using GarageBand.

2622
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:35,000
Yep.

2623
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:36,000
And it was all right.

2624
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:37,000
It was all right.

2625
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:38,000
It wasn't the...

2626
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:39,000
It was more the difference.

2627
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:40,000
Yeah.

2628
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:43,440
It was, it wasn't quite the clear quality that this show has, but it's good for like,

2629
02:39:43,440 --> 02:39:47,480
if we want to do something at this DDR tournament coming up and we need something quick and

2630
02:39:47,480 --> 02:39:48,840
dirty, it'll work.

2631
02:39:48,840 --> 02:39:54,000
I ordered an iPhone condenser mic for vlogging.

2632
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:55,000
Yes.

2633
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:57,960
I've actually thought about getting one of those two for the conventions and stuff.

2634
02:39:57,960 --> 02:40:01,140
The one I ordered, I ordered a cheap one to test it out, but there's another one that

2635
02:40:01,140 --> 02:40:06,160
was recommended that's about 50 bucks, but it's, it's more of an omni-directional and

2636
02:40:06,160 --> 02:40:07,160
you can change it.

2637
02:40:07,160 --> 02:40:08,160
Yeah.

2638
02:40:08,160 --> 02:40:11,560
So that one's on my list too, but I needed something, you know, I'm not going to spend

2639
02:40:11,560 --> 02:40:14,800
anything big because my iPhone 10 I'm going to get in January.

2640
02:40:14,800 --> 02:40:15,800
So.

2641
02:40:15,800 --> 02:40:17,800
There you go.

2642
02:40:17,800 --> 02:40:21,440
I've also got a steady cam ready to order too.

2643
02:40:21,440 --> 02:40:22,440
What's a steady cam?

2644
02:40:22,440 --> 02:40:23,440
Oh, for your vlog.

2645
02:40:23,440 --> 02:40:24,440
Cause you want to do vlogging.

2646
02:40:24,440 --> 02:40:27,800
Well, the thing, the good thing with the steady cam is that it uses a counterweight so that

2647
02:40:27,800 --> 02:40:31,600
no matter how you swing it, you have a steady spread the whole time.

2648
02:40:31,600 --> 02:40:36,440
I notice, uh, iPhone 10 and I only know, I don't, I can't compare it to anything Android

2649
02:40:36,720 --> 02:40:38,840
because I only know what I have and that's iPhone.

2650
02:40:38,840 --> 02:40:41,760
You can't control awesome to compare awesome to suck.

2651
02:40:41,760 --> 02:40:43,980
But the video quality is really good.

2652
02:40:43,980 --> 02:40:47,360
Like I was filming stuff at that, which by the way, we never got to talk about.

2653
02:40:47,360 --> 02:40:49,680
And you're, this is what you get when you don't call.

2654
02:40:49,680 --> 02:40:53,120
Dar Sacher wasn't able to talk about the Trixie and Katia's high school reunion thing with

2655
02:40:53,120 --> 02:40:54,840
me on the show last week.

2656
02:40:54,840 --> 02:40:58,840
But I shot some video there and I noticed, wow, like it doesn't shake.

2657
02:40:58,840 --> 02:41:02,120
Like the anti-shake stuff is really good stabilization in there.

2658
02:41:02,120 --> 02:41:03,120
Yeah.

2659
02:41:03,120 --> 02:41:06,420
And then like, as I'm panning back and forth, it's really smooth in the, so I was, I'm pretty

2660
02:41:06,420 --> 02:41:07,400
impressed.

2661
02:41:07,400 --> 02:41:11,180
Like what you're, and I can't see why androids don't have something better for a thousand

2662
02:41:11,180 --> 02:41:12,180
dollars.

2663
02:41:12,180 --> 02:41:15,100
I'm just really impressed at the fucking technology.

2664
02:41:15,100 --> 02:41:19,180
So if anyone's curious, it's on my Instagram, which is just dark Sakura.

2665
02:41:19,180 --> 02:41:22,300
So I put up the, the board in all of its dusty glory.

2666
02:41:22,300 --> 02:41:23,300
Yeah, I do.

2667
02:41:23,300 --> 02:41:25,740
I need to get some kind of compressed air and give that thing a bath.

2668
02:41:25,740 --> 02:41:28,140
You need microfiber cloths.

2669
02:41:28,140 --> 02:41:29,140
That's a pledge.

2670
02:41:29,140 --> 02:41:31,780
You know, my other thing is that I don't want to move any of the knobs.

2671
02:41:31,780 --> 02:41:32,780
I know.

2672
02:41:32,780 --> 02:41:33,780
I take a picture of the way it is.

2673
02:41:33,780 --> 02:41:34,780
I can set everything back.

2674
02:41:34,780 --> 02:41:35,780
I know.

2675
02:41:36,140 --> 02:41:37,820
All right, well, the phone's not ringing.

2676
02:41:37,820 --> 02:41:41,140
That means you ain't calling or it's broken, but again, I don't see anyone complaining,

2677
02:41:41,140 --> 02:41:42,140
but that's fine.

2678
02:41:42,140 --> 02:41:43,140
Y'all are just being shy.

2679
02:41:43,140 --> 02:41:44,140
It's cool.

2680
02:41:44,140 --> 02:41:45,140
It's cool.

2681
02:41:45,140 --> 02:41:46,140
Maybe next week.

2682
02:41:46,140 --> 02:41:47,140
Uh, we're going to wrap up the show for now though.

2683
02:41:47,140 --> 02:41:48,620
Uh, that's it.

2684
02:41:48,620 --> 02:41:49,740
We'll see you in seven days though.

2685
02:41:49,740 --> 02:41:50,740
We'll be back here.

2686
02:41:50,740 --> 02:41:56,140
I may be running a little late cause I'm going to be running back from San Francisco and

2687
02:41:56,140 --> 02:42:02,020
the Ingress event happening there because technically the big hoedown showdown is Saturday,

2688
02:42:02,020 --> 02:42:03,860
but then Sunday is the mission day.

2689
02:42:03,940 --> 02:42:08,020
Now with as long as I've been doing Ingress, I have yet to do a single fucking mission

2690
02:42:08,020 --> 02:42:09,020
day.

2691
02:42:09,020 --> 02:42:13,860
I missed the one in Chicago because I was flying home on Sunday, so I'm doing this one.

2692
02:42:13,860 --> 02:42:17,740
Even if this show is going to start late because of traffic, I'm fucking doing mission day

2693
02:42:17,740 --> 02:42:23,060
to get that fucking badge on my fucking profile that doesn't mean anything.

2694
02:42:23,060 --> 02:42:24,380
So there it is.

2695
02:42:24,380 --> 02:42:25,860
So I think it'll be fine though.

2696
02:42:25,860 --> 02:42:29,100
I think if I turn in the mission day thing by like two o'clock, three o'clock, that'll

2697
02:42:29,100 --> 02:42:30,340
give me time to get home.

2698
02:42:30,340 --> 02:42:32,540
I just may need Loki to produce next week episode.

2699
02:42:33,220 --> 02:42:34,900
I want to do a mission thingy.

2700
02:42:34,900 --> 02:42:35,900
I've never done one.

2701
02:42:35,900 --> 02:42:37,820
Come, come up to the city on Sunday.

2702
02:42:37,820 --> 02:42:41,260
Even if you don't want to do the Ingress, uh, hoedown throwdown on Saturday, you can

2703
02:42:41,260 --> 02:42:42,260
come do the mission day thingy.

2704
02:42:42,260 --> 02:42:43,860
Are you staying in the city?

2705
02:42:43,860 --> 02:42:45,460
Uh, probably.

2706
02:42:45,460 --> 02:42:51,020
I have to beg and plead my friend that I stay with, but I'm, I think I'd ran it by him already

2707
02:42:51,020 --> 02:42:52,020
and he knows.

2708
02:42:52,020 --> 02:42:54,300
I don't want to drive by myself.

2709
02:42:54,300 --> 02:42:55,300
I'm sorry.

2710
02:42:55,300 --> 02:42:57,940
Well, maybe who else plays here?

2711
02:42:57,940 --> 02:43:00,500
No one who would go with me.

2712
02:43:00,500 --> 02:43:01,500
You never know.

2713
02:43:01,500 --> 02:43:02,500
We'll see.

2714
02:43:03,460 --> 02:43:04,460
I'm not going to ride with people.

2715
02:43:04,460 --> 02:43:05,460
I don't know.

2716
02:43:05,460 --> 02:43:07,460
Like more than fleeting.

2717
02:43:07,460 --> 02:43:08,460
No, I understand.

2718
02:43:08,460 --> 02:43:09,460
I understand.

2719
02:43:09,460 --> 02:43:10,460
All right.

2720
02:43:10,460 --> 02:43:11,980
Uh, so there we go.

2721
02:43:11,980 --> 02:43:12,980
Uh, yeah.

2722
02:43:12,980 --> 02:43:16,140
So Squatch Kill is in chat saying, yes, I will be doing mission day.

2723
02:43:16,140 --> 02:43:19,180
You wonder, you see, he, I know if anybody knows what I'm going through, he knows what

2724
02:43:19,180 --> 02:43:20,220
I'm going through.

2725
02:43:20,220 --> 02:43:27,900
So if my show is late next week, then it's all Squatch Kill's fault, just so you know.

2726
02:43:27,900 --> 02:43:30,100
Or his wife's fault.

2727
02:43:30,700 --> 02:43:33,220
Anyway, I hope she's listening.

2728
02:43:33,220 --> 02:43:34,220
All right.

2729
02:43:34,220 --> 02:43:39,220
Uh, Oh, I liked that as to what her Matt's like, can you just give them your phone?

2730
02:43:39,220 --> 02:43:40,220
Hell the fuck?

2731
02:43:40,220 --> 02:43:41,220
No.

2732
02:43:41,220 --> 02:43:43,220
All right.

2733
02:43:43,220 --> 02:43:44,220
There we go.

2734
02:43:44,220 --> 02:43:45,220
We're going to wrap up.

2735
02:43:45,220 --> 02:43:46,220
Thanks you guys.

2736
02:43:46,220 --> 02:43:48,660
Uh, if you like what you heard here at orange launch radio, tell a friend or five about

2737
02:43:48,660 --> 02:43:49,660
the show.

2738
02:43:49,660 --> 02:43:52,580
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

2739
02:43:52,580 --> 02:43:56,660
But like, like when the phones don't light up, we can't get those, uh, voices out there

2740
02:43:56,660 --> 02:43:58,260
unless you, uh, let us know.

2741
02:43:58,260 --> 02:43:59,260
You can always email us.

2742
02:43:59,420 --> 02:44:00,420
You can tweet us at OLR.

2743
02:44:00,420 --> 02:44:02,580
You can Facebook us at orange launch radio.

2744
02:44:02,580 --> 02:44:07,300
You can use the website to send us a message because now we know that works.

2745
02:44:07,300 --> 02:44:08,900
Remember when it was broken for four years?

2746
02:44:08,900 --> 02:44:12,380
Well, we got our first email tonight that came from the website, so it works.

2747
02:44:12,380 --> 02:44:16,000
So you can do all those things, but just tell a friend or two about the show.

2748
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:17,460
Help us spread the word.

2749
02:44:17,460 --> 02:44:24,180
Um, because we don't have a big website or Fox news or CBS backing up this program.

2750
02:44:24,180 --> 02:44:27,140
So it's just us.

2751
02:44:27,140 --> 02:44:28,140
That's it.

2752
02:44:28,140 --> 02:44:29,620
Uh, help us spread the word.

2753
02:44:29,620 --> 02:44:32,100
Uh, I haven't found something really dirty to say.

2754
02:44:32,100 --> 02:44:34,620
All right, well then we'll go around and get everybody's final thought.

2755
02:44:34,620 --> 02:44:35,620
Oh yeah.

2756
02:44:35,620 --> 02:44:36,620
Five star review on iTunes.

2757
02:44:36,620 --> 02:44:37,940
Those places goes a long way too.

2758
02:44:37,940 --> 02:44:40,620
We'll go around and get everybody's final thoughts since Jamie has something to say.

2759
02:44:40,620 --> 02:44:43,220
I'm not going to say anything dirty cause I'm bad.

2760
02:44:43,220 --> 02:44:44,220
We'll start with Loki.

2761
02:44:44,220 --> 02:44:45,220
All right.

2762
02:44:45,220 --> 02:44:50,940
Um, I guess I will, you know, play VR games this week.

2763
02:44:50,940 --> 02:44:51,940
There you go.

2764
02:44:51,940 --> 02:44:52,940
VR Skyrim.

2765
02:44:52,940 --> 02:44:53,940
Who sold that?

2766
02:44:53,940 --> 02:44:54,940
I didn't.

2767
02:44:54,940 --> 02:45:02,020
I didn't buy it in because I've, I've already bought Skyrim and Skyrim HD and I have Skyrim

2768
02:45:02,020 --> 02:45:04,180
HD in my PC and I haven't bothered.

2769
02:45:04,180 --> 02:45:10,340
I was going to hold off in purchase on PCs someday when you know it's out cause I think

2770
02:45:10,340 --> 02:45:14,140
it's going to be better because on the PlayStation it's just kind of okay.

2771
02:45:14,140 --> 02:45:17,060
And eventually I do want to get VR headset for my PC.

2772
02:45:17,060 --> 02:45:19,740
I just haven't done it yet.

2773
02:45:19,740 --> 02:45:20,740
So I'm going to hold off.

2774
02:45:20,740 --> 02:45:21,740
I don't need it.

2775
02:45:21,740 --> 02:45:24,420
I just, I have a bunch of PlayStation VR games.

2776
02:45:24,420 --> 02:45:26,260
I just bought them.

2777
02:45:26,260 --> 02:45:27,940
I don't need another one.

2778
02:45:27,940 --> 02:45:31,780
My final thought is, and I'm only thinking this cause I can see my collection of fridge

2779
02:45:31,780 --> 02:45:35,580
magnets and I have a fridge magnet of this lady and I was just going to say Gilda Radner

2780
02:45:35,580 --> 02:45:37,100
was fucking awesome.

2781
02:45:37,100 --> 02:45:38,100
She was.

2782
02:45:38,100 --> 02:45:39,100
She was so fucking awesome.

2783
02:45:39,100 --> 02:45:40,500
Anyway, uh, dark soccer.

2784
02:45:40,500 --> 02:45:41,500
Your final thought?

2785
02:45:41,500 --> 02:45:45,820
Um, I'm going to go harass your cat now.

2786
02:45:45,820 --> 02:45:46,820
It sounds good.

2787
02:45:46,820 --> 02:45:52,180
Just get one of those fish cake things you had that he was, I digested them.

2788
02:45:52,180 --> 02:45:53,180
All right.

2789
02:45:53,180 --> 02:45:54,180
I'll burp fish out.

2790
02:45:54,180 --> 02:45:55,180
I do.

2791
02:45:55,180 --> 02:45:56,180
All right.

2792
02:45:56,180 --> 02:45:57,180
That's it.

2793
02:45:57,180 --> 02:45:58,180
Cats have no sense of sweetness.

2794
02:45:58,180 --> 02:45:59,180
We're done.

2795
02:45:59,180 --> 02:46:01,820
We'll be back in seven days later.

2796
02:46:01,820 --> 02:46:05,220
You've been listening to orange lounge radio.

2797
02:46:05,220 --> 02:46:11,140
Orange lounge radio is a production of OLR studios to join us for a live show.

2798
02:46:11,140 --> 02:46:19,060
Tune into fog network.com Sunday nights at 6 PM Pacific, 9 PM Eastern the views and opinions

2799
02:46:19,060 --> 02:46:23,940
expressed in this program do not necessarily reflect those of the staff of orange lounge

2800
02:46:23,940 --> 02:46:31,700
radio or fog network, but you know, they were all still true.

2801
02:46:31,700 --> 02:46:32,340
See you next week.
