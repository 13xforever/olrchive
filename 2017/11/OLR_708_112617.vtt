00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
This week Bungie gets caught with its hand in the cookie jar by displaying one set of experience points earned but granting another.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
They reportedly disabled this behavior but imply it could be back to changes.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
There's plenty more news and it all starts right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight.

00:39.000 --> 00:45.000
November the 26th of 2017 with episode number 708 of our show.

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
Joining you live over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:50.000 --> 00:59.000
Myself, Rob Roberts, also known as Skie on Twitter with my co-hosts say hello over there to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
Why do they always want the fish that I don't have?

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
Who may or may not be addicted to a certain cell phone game we're going to talk about later.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Don't you judge me.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
How was your fundraiser last week? We missed you.

01:09.000 --> 01:17.000
It went really well. We managed to donate a little over $300 to the Sacramento AIDS Foundation.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
That's great.

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
And played bingo and gave away lots of fabulous prizes.

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
There you go. Fabulous prizes? Shoot, I should have canceled on the show too.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
It was for a good cause and a lot of people can benefit from the work that we did.

01:31.000 --> 01:36.000
I totally said last week if she's going to miss a show, raising money for charity is a pretty good excuse.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
So there you go.

01:37.000 --> 01:43.000
And it is that season and I hope everybody here in the States, if you are listening to us here, I hope you had a great Thanksgiving.

01:44.000 --> 01:51.000
And I know this goes down cheesy, but we are really thankful that you guys, some of you tune in live on Sunday nights at vognetwork.com

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
and participate in our chat room, which I'll plug more thoroughly in a minute here.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
Some of you participate with our podcast stuff.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
Some of you have been doing this stuff for years and I have no idea that you're out there

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
because we never hear from you on Twitter or email or any of that stuff.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
We want to hear from you.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
Well, yeah, we would love to, but at the same time-

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
Come forward, stalkers.

02:09.000 --> 02:14.000
I respect the internet anxiety of not wanting to say hello because I've been there too.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
So no worries.

02:15.000 --> 02:24.000
But I do want to say thank you for supporting the show because this show did not run for 15 years on, you know, nothing.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
It ran on kitty kisses and sheet cakes.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
That feedback is very important.

02:29.000 --> 02:36.000
Yes, kitty kisses, now that we have over there, officially his name is, because many of you have been asking since last week's show,

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
Mr. Smoosh is our new kitty's name.

02:39.000 --> 02:46.000
So, and by the way, in true 2017, what do you call it? I'm not millennial. I'm not Gen X.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
It's Shellennial. What is the new one?

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
No, it's Zennial.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
Zennial, okay.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
With an X.

02:51.000 --> 02:57.000
In true Zennial fashion, I have set up an Instagram account for Mr. Smoosh, which you can follow.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
And it is at Mr. Smoosh.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
I haven't even done that for Midna yet, although she has a Tumblr.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
You have to spell it out, M-I-S-T-E-R, Smoosh.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
I have one for Midna, a Tumblr.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
Do you know one of the first people that followed Mr. Smoosh on Instagram?

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
Hm.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
TR's dogs.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Hobbit dogs?

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
Yeah, the Hobbit dogs.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
Alright.

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
Anyway, I have to say hello over there, of course, to Tech Master Loki.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
Hello.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Hi, Loki, how are you?

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
I'm doing okay.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
Have you set up Instagram accounts for your cats?

03:23.000 --> 03:30.000
No, because Facebook wants me to set up an Instagram account for myself, and I'm like, fuck off, I don't want to do this.

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
And then, like, I get friend requests on Instagram, and it's like, oh, you got some friends that want to follow you on Instagram?

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
I don't have a fucking Instagram account, stop trying to tell me I do.

03:38.000 --> 03:42.000
Like, I purposely shut this off, and you put it back on.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
We made one for you out of convenience, don't you want to Instagram?

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
Don't you want to follow Mr. Smoosh on Instagram, you heartless beast?

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
I'm sure it'll do it anyways, whether I want to or not.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
I know, I'm just waiting to see the whole, don't you want Mr. Smoosh to get a Facebook?

03:57.000 --> 04:02.000
It's like, Mr. Smoosh is a cat. They're not allowed to have Facebooks. Anyway.

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
About time I got a horse mackerel.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
Todd, you and this Animal Crossing thing.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
Alright, we're definitely going to talk about the Animal Crossing mobile game.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
I do want to get into our kickoff topic, which will be about that, actually.

04:14.000 --> 04:21.000
But first, I do want to acknowledge our chat room over at live.voggenetwork.com, because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network.

04:21.000 --> 04:27.000
voggenetwork.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
My cat had a live journal.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
Did your cat? That's right, your cat did have a live journal.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
It still technically does, because I don't think I ever did anything with it.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
Well now it's owned by the Russians.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
Yes.

04:38.000 --> 04:43.000
But that's, you know. Alright, looking in chat, let's see, Tiger Claw in chat says,

04:43.000 --> 04:49.000
So I heard you went to PetSmart, did they have any Black Friday deals, say on kitty litter and such?

04:49.000 --> 04:55.000
Actually, no. Here's the thing, we went to PetSmart because we just, you know, we've only had Mr. Smoosh for a week.

04:55.000 --> 05:00.000
So there's still some supplies, and I notice Alan really spoils this cat.

05:00.000 --> 05:05.000
I mean, we spoiled Sanrio and Maruko when they were here too, but we really spoiled this cat.

05:05.000 --> 05:10.000
And we, is he smooshing your hand? That's why we call him Mr. Smoosh, Starks, Ira.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
Okay, it's not just the face, but the hand.

05:12.000 --> 05:18.000
Anyway, so we went to PetSmart and we were trying to get, I don't even remember, oh yeah.

05:18.000 --> 05:27.000
Oh, we had to get a, we had to get a litter box with big walls on it because Mr. Smoosh really likes to kick litter.

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
And it was all over the floor in the old litter box. We had to get a litter box with high walls.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
And I was actually kind of looking around like, oh, I wonder what's on sale because it's Black Friday.

05:34.000 --> 05:40.000
I don't think a single damn thing was on sale, but does a store like PetSmart need to have sales? Like.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
I can give him Midna's taco costume.

05:43.000 --> 05:50.000
You will starve before you let your pet starve. That's the way a lot of people, not everybody, but most people are like that.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
Most pet owners I know would let themselves starve before they would let their pet starve.

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
And I would just, you know, they're going to, they're going to always buy the pet essentials.

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
What you will notice, Mr. Smoosh, we bought a purple sparkly bow tie.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
So that would be the special that we bought. We bought him a purple sparkly bow tie.

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
And he actually let us put it on him and he kept it on. It's so adorable. Anyway.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
Enough about cats. Let's talk about video games.

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
Actually, something a little more important than both those things, actually.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
I wanted to address this at the top of the show.

06:18.000 --> 06:25.000
And since I know you all are tech savvy enough to subscribe to podcasts and you probably use social media one form or another,

06:25.000 --> 06:31.000
I'm sure you've all heard about this by now, but I do want to stress this whole net neutrality thing. Okay?

06:31.000 --> 06:37.000
So if you haven't heard, well, and to be fair, we have listeners that live in other countries.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
So maybe they haven't heard.

06:39.000 --> 06:45.000
So they're trying to backtrack on what's called net neutrality laws here in the States.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
And I'm going to really like grossly oversimplify things.

06:48.000 --> 06:53.000
But basically we had a law that was signed into effect a few years ago that basically says

06:53.000 --> 06:58.000
internet providers cannot discriminate and treat some traffic different than others.

06:58.000 --> 07:06.000
A great example before this law was in, AT&T would not let you use FaceTime on the iPhone

07:06.000 --> 07:13.000
unless you paid for like a more souped up type of plan because my assumption is that AT&T saw this as competition.

07:13.000 --> 07:19.000
Well, what ended up happening is that all these other knockoff video chat apps really took off and people were using Skype and stuff.

07:19.000 --> 07:27.000
And then net neutrality laws came into place and AT&T couldn't do that anymore because they couldn't charge more or less than one thing for another.

07:27.000 --> 07:34.000
And so what's happening now is that our current administration, the current FCC chief has basically promised...

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
You mean Sir Shithead?

07:35.000 --> 07:43.000
Well, I try not to get political on this show, but honestly this net neutrality thing is something that I see people on both sides

07:43.000 --> 07:48.000
understand why we have net neutrality and why it would be bad that it went away.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
So I kind of feel like this is kind of okay.

07:51.000 --> 07:57.000
As a person who lives on the internet, I think this is pretty clear cut and dry.

07:57.000 --> 08:04.000
From one element, I understand in a way what Comcast, at least what they're trying to say is the reason for this.

08:04.000 --> 08:10.000
Comcast is trying to say what they're trying to stop happening is basically illegal traffic.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
They want to be able to stop BitTorrent.

08:12.000 --> 08:19.000
To be fair, I get that. I'm not going to defend piracy of Game of Thrones and shit like that.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
That part of it I'm not going to defend.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
BitTorrent isn't illegal traffic. BitTorrent is a client.

08:23.000 --> 08:27.000
Bingo. Bingo. And here's where we get into...

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
Let's just block all web browsers.

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
And that's where I get into, I don't know if I trust Comcast.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
I don't know if I trust anyone to do this right.

08:35.000 --> 08:39.000
Because what is going to be the algorithm that shows if something is illegal or not?

08:39.000 --> 08:44.000
And let me tell you, having this podcast that we do here at Orange Lounge Radio

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
and having the Voice Geeks Network, vognetwork.com,

08:47.000 --> 08:53.000
we've been doing this show for over 15 years and nobody takes us seriously still.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
Which, you know, it's fine. Whatever. We're hobbyists.

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
I gave up on the prospect of getting famous from this a long time ago and that's fine.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
We have a small family here that we love and adore and that's awesome.

09:04.000 --> 09:11.000
But the reason why I say that is that let's say that internet radio is deemed a form of piracy.

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
Well, who's to say that they're not going to suddenly block VOG Network or something like that?

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
And what if there's these broad strokes?

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
Oh, there's this giant download of an MP3.

09:23.000 --> 09:28.000
It must be the new Taylor Swift album and these things start getting blocked.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
And you might think I'm being a little bit crazy here,

09:31.000 --> 09:37.000
but I think the precedent is there with what happens on YouTube and their automated algorithms

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
is you see shit that shouldn't be getting blocked all of the time.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
And I understand that YouTube...

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
Well, just this week, whole channels were deleted.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
Yeah.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
For sure. For sure.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
Konan's channel was deleted.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
I want to say there were some other big YouTubers.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
There's a ton of channels just like, boop, gone.

09:57.000 --> 10:03.000
So anyhow, the long story short, if this whole net neutrality repeal happens,

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
it's not going to be pretty.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
I do think some of the graphics you see out there on the internet

10:10.000 --> 10:16.000
where ISPs would charge $5 for Facebook and $5 for gaming and all that stuff,

10:16.000 --> 10:22.000
I don't know, I'm a little bit apprehensive as to if that would really happen to that degree.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
But, hold on before you get out your pitchforks,

10:26.000 --> 10:33.000
but this whole thing with the loot boxes we've been talking about ad nauseum on the show for the past couple weeks

10:33.000 --> 10:38.000
has just gone to show that companies in it for profit,

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
be it video game companies or cable companies,

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
they'll dip their big toe in the water trying to nickel and dime you.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
And if that works, they'll put their foot in the water trying to nickel and dime you,

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
and then they'll put their leg in, and then they'll put the whole waste...

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
You know what I'm getting at here?

10:51.000 --> 10:56.000
We might go back to this whole AT&T just kind of does the FaceTime thing first,

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
and then kind of see what happens there.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
Or, oh, we're only going to block Bittorrent.

11:00.000 --> 11:06.000
But that means that independent games that are free, that are distributed via Bittorrent,

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
are also going to get impacted.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
And then where is that going to lead to?

11:10.000 --> 11:14.000
It's going to lead to another file transfer service that someone's going to make.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
I mean, it's just like how they want to basically say,

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
listen, we want to write to be able to throttle stuff,

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
but don't worry, we're not going to throttle anything. Trust us.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
If you don't want to throttle anybody,

11:25.000 --> 11:31.000
then why are you fighting and paying so much money to politicians to throttle stuff?

11:31.000 --> 11:38.000
History has shown us that in terms of money-making facilities for profit companies,

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
they will murder to get their bottom line.

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
I mean, you want to look just even as far back as 100 years ago.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
You know, look at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
Look at the molasses flood.

11:50.000 --> 11:57.000
I mean, we've got history on our side that shows that companies will pretty reasonably,

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
once you give them an inch, they will take a mile.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
And Bobby Blackwolf in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

12:04.000 --> 12:09.000
The only reason it can happen here is because we don't exactly have regional competition for ISPs,

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
so the free market can't work it out. Exactly.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
Comcast is the only option here.

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
I had a guy come to the door, just not even within the past week, going,

12:17.000 --> 12:21.000
Oh, hey, we're trying to be a competitor to Comcast in this area,

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
and we wanted to know if you'd be interested in switching.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
We got some great deals.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
And I was like, I was actually into it for some like,

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Oh, great, Comcast has a competitor.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
Well, tell me about your internet packages.

12:31.000 --> 12:35.000
And he's like, Oh, well, actually, we only compete with them with television.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
We don't have a high speed internet service yet.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
And I'm like, God damn it, that's the one thing I was willing to let.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
I don't give a shit about TV anymore.

12:42.000 --> 12:47.000
It's like Comcast or AT&T, and it's like AT&T are high speed six megabits.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
But I would be, you know what?

12:49.000 --> 12:54.000
I would be willing to go to high speed six megabits, which means backwards, a big step,

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
to have open internet.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
But it won't be.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
I know it won't. I know it won't.

12:59.000 --> 13:06.000
And again, to fully kind of go with what I'm going with here with what Bobby said,

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
you know, he's right.

13:07.000 --> 13:11.000
In most areas, Comcast is your only option, or whatever the provider is in your area,

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
is the only option.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
And here's my thing.

13:14.000 --> 13:20.000
Does Comcast believe enough in this that it's willing to split itself up

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
so that we can have competition so that the free market can regulate itself?

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
Because I bet the answer to that is no.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
No, they already have agreed.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
Trying to get bigger.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
Yeah, they're letting them get bigger with different things.

13:30.000 --> 13:39.000
I mean, they've taken back a lot of different regulations that were in place to stop these monopolies.

13:39.000 --> 13:49.000
It's all, he's basically, as they would put it, the FCC is a compromise agency, basically.

13:49.000 --> 13:54.000
So it's under control now by these big companies.

13:54.000 --> 13:59.000
So obviously, anything that they're doing, he's getting a big payout at the end somehow.

13:59.000 --> 14:04.000
So anyway, and what does this have to do with games?

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
Because I'll tell you what.

14:06.000 --> 14:12.000
If there was ever something that is a premium Xbox Live, PlayStation Network, Nintendo Network,

14:12.000 --> 14:17.000
those are going to be the first things up for an additional fee.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Those would be the first things as a gamer.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
What does this mean to you if you're not in the U.S.?

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
Well, you know what?

14:23.000 --> 14:28.000
A lot of the content you guys consume, including this particular show, a lot of it comes from the U.S.

14:28.000 --> 14:34.000
So absolutely, this could have a trickle effect on what happens in other countries as well.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
So anyhow, I know...

14:36.000 --> 14:42.000
Communications needs to be, I mean, maybe not with the current administration,

14:42.000 --> 14:48.000
but I strongly feel that there needs to be, that instead of privatizing it, it needs to be...

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
Crap, what's the word I was thinking of?

14:51.000 --> 14:57.000
Brought under, I would probably say even just government agency.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
Well, that's I think what they're doing now.

14:58.000 --> 15:04.000
They're trying to bring it under the FTC, but I don't think that they have enough manpower to be able to regulate all that.

15:04.000 --> 15:10.000
Well, honestly enough, I believe that our country itself is too big to govern properly, but that's a whole other...

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
A whole other Oprah.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
Anyway, which by the way, did you know Oprah had a podcast?

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
I didn't learn that until this week and I was like...

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
Must not have been very good.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
Actually, she had an interview with Joe Biden that was really good.

15:20.000 --> 15:23.000
You know what? We've been doing this longer than Oprah, okay?

15:23.000 --> 15:27.000
That is true. We have been podcasting longer than Oprah, but I did...

15:27.000 --> 15:34.000
I'm not going to lie to you. I did have that moment of, well, if Oprah is podcasting now, should I just quit?

15:37.000 --> 15:42.000
I'm not going to lie to you. I'm like, if Oprah is here, I mean, that's it.

15:42.000 --> 15:47.000
Anyway, okay, so all these jokes aside and things, it is a serious thing.

15:47.000 --> 15:53.000
Again, I think most of you that are tech savvy enough to listen to podcasts probably already have some awareness that this is going on.

15:53.000 --> 15:58.000
But I would urge you to take a look at battleforthenet.com for some more information,

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
including some actual protests that are going to be happening.

16:01.000 --> 16:05.000
I believe December 7th is the date and they're going to protest actually at some Verizon stores.

16:05.000 --> 16:09.000
And I think that is something that's definitely going to get a lot of attention, a lot of coverage.

16:09.000 --> 16:14.000
But you can't just sit there and do nothing. You have to pick up the phone and make some noise.

16:14.000 --> 16:19.000
Form letters aren't going to do a lot. The FCC literally came out and said,

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
we disregarded all the comments because they were all form letters. They said that.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
But they didn't even...

16:25.000 --> 16:29.000
I know, I know, but it's out there. So don't rely on form letters.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
Call.

16:30.000 --> 16:36.000
You have to pick up the phone, call. You have to go out, be seen, be heard. Don't rely on armchair politics.

16:37.000 --> 16:42.000
Honestly, even if they weren't form letters and they're not, I mean, they're just making excuses.

16:42.000 --> 16:47.000
They're by law, they have to do that, but they're just like, fuck it, we don't care.

16:47.000 --> 16:51.000
So participate in your government and don't let them do this.

16:51.000 --> 16:56.000
And if they do do it, you know, that has to be a reality that we have to face too.

16:56.000 --> 17:01.000
If this does go through, you have to hold corporations liable, which to tie this back to gaming,

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
we're seeing happen a lot now with the loot boxes.

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
Again, I don't want to repeat that whole shindig from last week too much,

17:08.000 --> 17:14.000
but I think what we've really seen happen is that, you know, EA got hit hard over this Battlefront thing.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
And that's kind of why they scaled back.

17:16.000 --> 17:21.000
And we have some stories coming up on tonight's show where other companies are now starting to,

17:21.000 --> 17:25.000
oh shit, we better dial this back before we're the next Twitter target.

17:25.000 --> 17:29.000
I only think it's necessary before the next Twitter target is that they see,

17:29.000 --> 17:33.000
oh shit, countries are starting to look at this as like,

17:33.000 --> 17:38.000
we better investigate this formally to see if this is gambling and whether we're going to classify it as gambling.

17:38.000 --> 17:43.000
And they're seeing that their whole source of revenue is going to be just yanked from undering them.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
And if there's one thing we've seen in this gaming industry,

17:46.000 --> 17:51.000
any time the government threatens to regulate it, they go, oh shit, and regulate itself.

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
Hence why we have an ESRB in the first place.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
So anyway, we'll come back to that point in a minute.

17:57.000 --> 18:02.000
But first, on a not so serious topic, let's change to something that is happy news.

18:02.000 --> 18:07.000
I think for everybody. And that is, you know, we've had some game releases these past couple of weeks.

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
A lot of the big end of the year titles are starting to come out.

18:10.000 --> 18:14.000
But one of them that I know many of you have been looking forward to, you Nintendo nerds,

18:14.000 --> 18:19.000
I'm looking at you, is Animal Crossing for mobile devices.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
Animal Crossing, I forget the subtitle all of a sudden, Pocket Camper.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
Is that the name of it? Animal Crossing Pocket Camper.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
Some Pocket Camp.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
Pocket Camp finally came out on mobile devices this week.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
Jamie, you've been playing a lot of this.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
In fact, I see you tapping your phone.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
You're probably playing it right now.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
So what are your thoughts on Animal Crossing?

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
It's cute. I really like it.

18:39.000 --> 18:44.000
You know, I don't think it could have been much better done than this.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
I mean, given the limitations.

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
So, yeah, I really like it.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
This lamp is in the wrong place.

18:51.000 --> 18:55.000
I mean, seriously, I've been playing it like I played, you know, old school Animal Crossing.

18:55.000 --> 18:59.000
So it can't be, you know, too bad.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
I've been really happy with it. So.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
I think it's OK.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Well, I didn't ask.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
I'm a gamer and I'm going to share my opinion anyway.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
Here's the thing.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
Well, the price is right. It's free.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
So you can't go wrong with free.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
I would not buy leave tickets, but that's a personal decision.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
That's fine. That's a personal decision.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
I have spent money on Pokemon Go and people have judged me for that.

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
So that's plenty fine. You spend money on what you like.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
But I would not spend money on this yourself, at least.

19:30.000 --> 19:34.000
Well, that's what I say today. Who knows what patches might come into the game at a later date.

19:34.000 --> 19:38.000
Right. So I like it in the fact that it looks really nice.

19:38.000 --> 19:43.000
I know that sounds really silly, but like on you know, I have the new iPhone 10 and has that newer screen.

19:43.000 --> 19:52.000
And I'm like, wow, the textures on this like they're really like HD and it really kind of pops like, you know, for old school cartoony style, it really does pop.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
So like graphically, it's good.

19:54.000 --> 20:01.000
And I like the way that some of the things translate into the touchscreens, like the fishing and the bug catching is so much easier. Right.

20:01.000 --> 20:08.000
But I kind of don't like how it feels like it's scenes from an Animal Crossing game.

20:08.000 --> 20:14.000
Like it's like you could go see Les Miserables on Broadway.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
That's playing a real Animal Crossing game.

20:16.000 --> 20:23.000
Or you could listen to the soundtrack that just has like I Dreamed a Dream and the nine other big songs, but kind of skips the rest of it.

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
And you can kind of skip around and listen to your favorite songs.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
You can have that. And that's kind of what Animal Crossing Pocket Camp is to me.

20:29.000 --> 20:34.000
It's like you have these like greatest scenes, but they kind of string together in a really weird way.

20:34.000 --> 20:42.000
Like I, I like the questing system, but I don't really care for how repetitive it feels.

20:42.000 --> 20:46.000
Like I feel there is nothing to do for these little fuckers.

20:46.000 --> 20:55.000
Then get fruit, catch fish, catch bugs, which to be fair was kind of all that the regular Animal Crossing game was as well.

20:55.000 --> 21:01.000
But I do feel like at least there was more variety in where you could find items, how you procured things.

21:01.000 --> 21:05.000
You could kind of make your custom clothes. There just seemed like there was more that you could do.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
Is there like more like can you do the custom stuff in this?

21:07.000 --> 21:12.000
No, at least not that I've seen yet. I haven't seen the mailbox or any of that stuff yet.

21:12.000 --> 21:17.000
So like I said, it's greatest hits. Some of the stuff is kind of cut, but then you have some other stuff that's kind of like interesting.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
See, that's the problem that I have. I've always had Animal Crossing.

21:20.000 --> 21:24.000
It's like you take the first one, which is just like this amazing thing.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
Right.

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
They had like the NES games and all that cool stuff in there and all the custom stuff.

21:28.000 --> 21:33.000
And then each iteration that came out afterwards, it's like we're removing more things from it.

21:33.000 --> 21:37.000
And then we're getting down to this, which this is free.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
So I guess I can't complain.

21:39.000 --> 21:43.000
Yeah, you're in this weird place where it's like, but it's free. And that's kind of what I come back to as well.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
It's like, well, well, but it's free. So it's not a horrible thing.

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
But here's my thing. Here's my number one thing. Let me just get this out.

21:49.000 --> 21:54.000
My number one thing is, and you know, for the people that love this game, I think even you could agree with me on this.

21:54.000 --> 21:59.000
I would not want this to replace Animal Crossing on consoles.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
And I have a fear it might.

22:02.000 --> 22:06.000
Like everybody's like, when are they going to announce Animal Crossing for the Switch?

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
When are they going to announce Animal Crossing for the Switch?

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
The Pikmin games are going to put out first.

22:10.000 --> 22:14.000
Here's my thing, guys. Has Nintendo said they're going to make Animal Crossing for the Switch?

22:14.000 --> 22:20.000
I don't believe they have. And if they keep selling leaf tickets on this thing, do they have motivation to make one?

22:20.000 --> 22:24.000
Are people buying leaf tickets on this thing? I mean, Jamie did.

22:24.000 --> 22:28.000
I know other people. I'm not just going to pick on her. I know plenty of people who have.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
Some of my other mobile gaming buddies have fessed up to doing it too.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
So, you know.

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
I did get into the quarry and I did it to buy more storage space.

22:36.000 --> 22:41.000
And it does, I will admit, I have been enticed because you can craft more than one thing at one time.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
If you spend those tickets.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
I have the three crafting things too.

22:45.000 --> 22:52.000
So there are things to do. But again, I can't sit here and be like, oh, Jamie, you're so dumb for buying leaf tickets.

22:52.000 --> 22:56.000
And then I sit here and spend money to get a hundred Pokeballs and Pokemon Go.

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
Like I just, I can't, I don't have the fucking conscience to do that. I can't do it.

22:59.000 --> 23:02.000
So like she buys the things she likes. I buy the things I like.

23:02.000 --> 23:08.000
Right. And I'm not saying it's terrible. I'm just, you know, it's fine. This is a free mobile game.

23:08.000 --> 23:13.000
So you're just wondering if that's really the position Nintendo is going to be in.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
People really are, because the people are spending a ton of money on this.

23:16.000 --> 23:24.000
But then, yeah, I could see that this would be more profitable for them because they're making money constantly.

23:24.000 --> 23:31.000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I am sad that Super Mario Run canceled all Mario console games.

23:31.000 --> 23:40.000
Well, I actually, you say that tongue in cheek, but my understanding is Nintendo believes that game to have underperformed.

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
So it wouldn't cancel Mario games anyway.

23:43.000 --> 23:51.000
And at the same time, Mario's in this weird universe where like multiple Mario games exist simultaneously on the same console.

23:51.000 --> 23:59.000
What I mean by that is you had Mario 3D World and Mario Maker, both like full fleshed games on the Wii U.

23:59.000 --> 24:05.000
And Super Mario Run is a unique niche. It's a weird, the whole like nonstop running thing.

24:05.000 --> 24:09.000
It's a weird niche and one I didn't particularly care for ultimately.

24:09.000 --> 24:20.000
But I think Nintendo like really purposefully wanted to not make a new Super Mario Brothers Wii type of Mario game or new Super Mario Brothers 3DS, whatever.

24:20.000 --> 24:27.000
They didn't want to make that game on mobiles. They wanted, they actually did something to make this very different.

24:27.000 --> 24:37.000
But Animal Crossing, it doesn't feel that different. It just feels skipped around. Like I said, like a greatest hits album.

24:37.000 --> 24:43.000
That's the only thing. I think greatest hits albums are good. I like to listen to Abba Gold.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
Unless they edit them like that Samantha Fox album.

24:45.000 --> 24:53.000
I like to listen to Abba Gold sometimes. But you know, sometimes I need that deep cut. Sometimes I need to hear Happy New Year.

24:53.000 --> 24:59.000
Okay, and that was non-Abba Gold. So sometimes you have to get the deep cuts. Anyway.

24:59.000 --> 25:07.000
SSG100Matt points out, there is a KK Slider doing I Dreamed a Dream. Of course there is. Of course there is.

25:07.000 --> 25:13.000
And then Act F points out, I know Pokemon won't be released ever again. Only Pokemon Go.

25:13.000 --> 25:18.000
Act F says Nintendo is doing this to promote their games. It's not to replace the original.

25:18.000 --> 25:22.000
Well I hope you're right because I do think the Switch would be a great platform for Animal Crossing.

25:22.000 --> 25:31.000
But I don't want it to be the same Animal Crossing rehashed again. I do hope they really try to.

25:31.000 --> 25:39.000
I mean if this Animal Crossing Pocket Camper is kind of like the love letter to the old school Animal Crossing games.

25:39.000 --> 25:43.000
Then great. Fine. It's a greatest hits album. It's a nice little send off.

25:43.000 --> 25:47.000
But I would really like to see Animal Crossing on the Switch kind of bring some new features.

25:47.000 --> 25:53.000
And I'm not talking about like a mall. Like I would like to see them do more with the online.

25:53.000 --> 25:58.000
I would love to see the arcade games come back. I know it's never going to be the NES games.

25:58.000 --> 26:03.000
But it's not like Nintendo doesn't know how to make mini games. You know, they could make unique to Animal Crossing games.

26:03.000 --> 26:08.000
I would like to see more of the exploration stuff. Like how you used to be able to go to the island.

26:08.000 --> 26:13.000
I think it would be really cool if there were other ways you could visit other types of atmospheres.

26:13.000 --> 26:19.000
Maybe more traveling and maybe that could be the theme of the next Animal Crossing game is that you travel around the world or something.

26:19.000 --> 26:23.000
And maybe something where there's like different cultures and different towns and things like that.

26:23.000 --> 26:28.000
But the tongue in cheek thing is that the cultures wouldn't necessarily have to reflect the cultures IRL.

26:28.000 --> 26:36.000
You could go to like the penguin land and you could go to where all those bitch sheep live and so forth.

26:36.000 --> 26:41.000
Bitch sheep land. And you could you could all the sheep are bitches. You could bury all the.

26:41.000 --> 26:46.000
Have you met Barbara? She's a bitch. You could bury Ed up to his neck.

26:46.000 --> 26:51.000
And I don't know how the horned dynastids poke him.

26:51.000 --> 26:57.000
They just need to send Barbara into the upside down to be eaten by a Demogorgon.

26:57.000 --> 27:02.000
You know what? Why not put the upside down in Animal Crossing? Maybe something kind of neat could happen.

27:02.000 --> 27:07.000
I would like a sick twist like that. Animal Crossing survival horror. I'm down.

27:07.000 --> 27:13.000
Come on, dark soccer. See now the thing, the pitfalls. Now they have a purpose because they send you to the upside down to survival horror.

27:13.000 --> 27:20.000
And remember the dream village and there was the murder mystery dream village like called Aika town.

27:20.000 --> 27:27.000
No, I don't. Oh, oh, yeah. Remember? Yes. Yes. And you'd find like the broken dolls and like the weird story it would tell.

27:27.000 --> 27:32.000
Yes. I still have a save for Aika village. It was pretty crazy.

27:32.000 --> 27:37.000
As long as Barbara is the first to die. She's going to be she's going to be the new. I almost said a spoiler. I can't say it.

27:37.000 --> 27:43.000
All right. Some people still haven't watched Stranger Things. Cat butt scrooches.

27:43.000 --> 27:49.000
Anyway, Robert M in chat says, since the mobile game autosaves is Mr. Resetti involved.

27:49.000 --> 27:52.000
Now, I don't believe he's in this mobile game at all.

27:52.000 --> 27:57.000
So that's that's one of those B sides that got overlooked on the greatest hits album is Mr. Resetti.

27:57.000 --> 28:02.000
But who knows? They might they might patch stuff in. Who knows? You know, again, I don't hate Animal Crossing.

28:02.000 --> 28:07.000
It's free. I just I'm not motivated to spend money, but she is.

28:07.000 --> 28:12.000
So maybe Nintendo is doing something right. And I'm sure it's more of you out there spending money on it, too.

28:12.000 --> 28:19.000
So there you go. Animal Crossing. Oh, I want to check our discord as well, because I know I like to post little plugs in our discord.

28:19.000 --> 28:23.000
And if you want to join our discord server, I highly recommend you do.

28:23.000 --> 28:28.000
Just go to vognetwork.com slash discord and you can join the discord for the voice geeks network.

28:28.000 --> 28:33.000
vognetwork.com. Again, that's vognetwork.com slash discord.

28:33.000 --> 28:37.000
JD in chat says, I'm mostly enjoying Animal Crossing Pocket Camp.

28:37.000 --> 28:41.000
It definitely has that freemium flavor, but I haven't felt pressured to buy anything.

28:41.000 --> 28:45.000
I've kind of settled into a play 30 minutes every three hours routine.

28:45.000 --> 28:49.000
That's from JD on Discord. Dartitsuya says, I only play a little bit of it.

28:49.000 --> 28:52.000
I just have to figure out where to get the friend code stuff started.

28:52.000 --> 28:56.000
Oh, and actually JD kind of answers this, too, but I'll answer it here.

28:56.000 --> 29:02.000
You I mean, I see people posting their screen caps of friend codes everywhere, and that's great.

29:02.000 --> 29:06.000
But just just link it to Facebook and Twitter if you have them.

29:06.000 --> 29:12.000
And that's how I found everybody. Just go to Facebook on Twitter and then just add everybody that way.

29:12.000 --> 29:15.000
So it does have those links in there. You don't even ever need the friend code.

29:15.000 --> 29:21.000
And then I found people that I had no idea played these games that were playing it thanks to Facebook.

29:21.000 --> 29:30.000
The one little thing I wish it would do is that it never tells you again who the person is after the first time you add them.

29:30.000 --> 29:36.000
Like I'll be able to see like Jamie Summers on Facebook is here as Sakura.

29:36.000 --> 29:41.000
You know, I'll be able to see that. But if I forget that she's Sakura, like I'll never remember that that was Jamie's character.

29:41.000 --> 29:44.000
If it doesn't like because never tells you after you initially add them.

29:44.000 --> 29:48.000
That's the one kind of bummer thing that I hope they hope they fix.

29:48.000 --> 29:52.000
But I believe that was the case in Nami Tomo and all that stuff, too.

29:52.000 --> 29:56.000
So JD points out if someone else adds you, it doesn't tell you who they are.

29:56.000 --> 30:00.000
No, it doesn't, does it? No, it's only when you add them that you know who they are.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
So there are there are some imperfections there.

30:02.000 --> 30:07.000
But Nintendo online, I don't expect them to ever get that right.

30:07.000 --> 30:10.000
JD says, I got a friend request from pumpkin.

30:10.000 --> 30:14.000
And I don't know if it's someone I know or some rando who encountered me in their game.

30:14.000 --> 30:19.000
It's not me. I know I'm a prime suspect with all things pumpkin, but it's not me.

30:19.000 --> 30:22.000
I'll give you that. Anyhow.

30:22.000 --> 30:26.000
All right. Let's move on. We got other gaming things we want to talk about tonight.

30:26.000 --> 30:32.000
Let's first, though, get into our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

30:35.000 --> 30:41.000
I played Dragon Age Inquisition. I played Mass Effect Andromeda for a little bit.

30:41.000 --> 30:44.000
I cannot stop looking at this cat.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
Mr. Smoosh is going to ruin this show.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
Smooshles. Smooshles.

30:48.000 --> 30:52.000
And I say that because we always get distracted by Mr. Smoosh.

30:52.000 --> 30:57.000
Mr. Smoosh may be the biggest case yet for the show going to video,

30:57.000 --> 31:00.000
because I always said, like, I don't know if it would be fun to put us on cam,

31:00.000 --> 31:03.000
but we could put Mr. Smoosh on cam and then everybody would watch.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
Yep. Cat cam.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
Yeah.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
We call it the smoosh cam.

31:08.000 --> 31:13.000
But I've been playing some Itomo. I'm playing idle pouring.

31:13.000 --> 31:16.000
I think I'm on my third rebirth now. Third or fourth. I don't know.

31:16.000 --> 31:19.000
I don't even know what that means. I kind of stopped. Sorry.

31:19.000 --> 31:22.000
After, like, you played it once.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
I played it once a week.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
Once.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
Once across a week and then I was done.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
Whatever.

31:28.000 --> 31:34.000
And, of course, I'm playing Pokemon Go and Animal Crossing.

31:34.000 --> 31:38.000
Click, click, click, click, click, click. Animal Crossing.

31:38.000 --> 31:41.000
No Ed. Thank God. No Ed.

31:41.000 --> 31:44.000
We got Super Mario Galaxy.

31:44.000 --> 31:48.000
And so Dan's been mostly playing it. I have played some.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
We broke out four player arms.

31:50.000 --> 31:53.000
Wait, wait, wait. Mario Galaxy on the Wii?

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
Odyssey. Sorry.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Oh, Odyssey. It's hard to keep them all straight.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
Whatever. It's Mario something or the other.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
Yeah.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
With the giant. Okay. So I have to bring this up.

32:01.000 --> 32:04.000
You know how, like, your hat guy lives in hat town?

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
Mm hmm.

32:05.000 --> 32:09.000
It made me remember the series that was on Pinwheel.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
Do you remember Pinwheel?

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
Like that used to come out like 6 a.m. on Nickelodeon?

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
Right.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.000
Hell yeah.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
Pinwheel. Pinwheel. Spin me around.

32:17.000 --> 32:23.000
And one of the little British shows that it showed in there was the Hat Village. Remember that?

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
Kind of.

32:24.000 --> 32:28.000
When I went and looked it up, it was fucking called the, like, Hattytown Adventures.

32:28.000 --> 32:34.000
And the main hat was a sombrero named Sancho.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
This is like from 1979 or something.

32:36.000 --> 32:41.000
My brain, like, kind of combined Pinwheel and Today's Special. I keep thinking they're the same show.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
Today's Special was fun.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
Wasn't Today's Special Canadian?

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
It was. It was a set in a department store.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
Everything on Nickelodeon in the early 80s was Canadian.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
And the lady was a mannequin.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.000
Everything.

32:52.000 --> 32:53.000
The lady was a mannequin. Remember?

32:53.000 --> 32:54.000
Yes.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
Anyway. And the puppet security guard.

32:56.000 --> 33:01.000
Yes. I'm really going to be intimidated by a damn puppet with some fucking pasta mustache.

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
Whatever.

33:02.000 --> 33:07.000
Well, anyway, but it's just that whole game gave me flashbacks to Hattytown Village.

33:07.000 --> 33:10.000
Or Hattytown Avengers or whatever the fuck it was called.

33:10.000 --> 33:14.000
So, especially the Bobby hat. That's what it made me think of.

33:14.000 --> 33:19.000
Because the constable in the town was called Bobby and he was a constable hat.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
Anyway.

33:20.000 --> 33:24.000
There's like two listeners. Everybody else is way too fucking young to understand.

33:24.000 --> 33:28.000
You children. I had younger siblings and I was forced to watch this shit.

33:28.000 --> 33:32.000
Let us 40-somethings have our moment. Or nearly 40-somethings.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
I got the cat's tail. He doesn't care.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
And so.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
Because you're helping him lick his ass.

33:38.000 --> 33:41.000
There you go. There you go. Lick. Lick. Lick. Lick. Lick.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
I do that to Midna too.

33:43.000 --> 33:50.000
But we also broke out both of our Joy-Con sets and played ARMS 4 player.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
Which was really kind of cool.

33:52.000 --> 33:57.000
And that's kind of it.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
Hattytown.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
Alright.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
Just say Hattytown three times fast.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
Hattytown. Hattytown. Hattytown.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
It's kind of funny.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

34:07.000 --> 34:11.000
Well I played League of Marvel Superheroes 2.

34:11.000 --> 34:15.000
More of that because I'm just trying to unlock all the characters for my kids.

34:15.000 --> 34:16.000
And.

34:16.000 --> 34:19.000
Let's see what else.

34:19.000 --> 34:23.000
I bought South Park but I haven't played it yet.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
I really. Like I bought it on Playstation 4.

34:25.000 --> 34:29.000
And since my wife hogs the TV I really should have tried it on.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
I should have gotten it on PC.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
In hindsight.

34:33.000 --> 34:36.000
But you know I figured I had pre-ordered it originally on Playstation 4.

34:36.000 --> 34:40.000
And I got the free copy of South Park The Stick of Truth.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
So I was like I'll just do it again on there.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
But I tried to do the whole.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
Like I haven't.

34:46.000 --> 34:51.000
I was doing the Playstation streaming on my old laptop.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
Which is pretty old.

34:53.000 --> 34:56.000
And my new laptop I'm like well shit this should do it way better.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
Oh my fucking god.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
Their app is a piece of shit.

35:00.000 --> 35:04.000
Like first off apparently there's this issue where there's.

35:04.000 --> 35:07.000
Okay so you start off you load in everything.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
You sign up your account or whatever.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
So I did all that.

35:11.000 --> 35:14.000
And so I had to factor out the first before the two factor authentication.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
They want me to do a reCAPTCHA.

35:16.000 --> 35:20.000
And it's like okay click on all the pictures that are a car.

35:20.000 --> 35:23.000
And keep clicking on them until there are no more cars.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
I will tell you this much.

35:25.000 --> 35:29.000
I was clicking on that fucking picture for 30 fucking minutes.

35:29.000 --> 35:32.000
Because every time the last square had a car picture in it.

35:32.000 --> 35:35.000
I click on it and another fucking car picture did.

35:35.000 --> 35:39.000
And it kept doing that over and fucking over again.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
Until it finally let me in.

35:41.000 --> 35:46.000
And then after all that then it wanted to do two factor authentication on my fucking phone.

35:46.000 --> 35:50.000
And after all that then it didn't fucking work very well.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
It's like laggy as shit.

35:52.000 --> 35:56.000
So fuck you Sony your stuff sucks.

35:56.000 --> 36:05.000
And apparently this is an issue that anybody that uses the PC app for PlayStation streaming or whatever.

36:05.000 --> 36:09.000
It's been going on for over a year now.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
That they haven't just fixed this shit.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
It's just been fucking broken for a while now.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
So.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
I missed the CAPTCHA we had at VOG.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
The whole like play a mini game.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
That thing was awesome.

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
The company shut down.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
We didn't want to get rid of it.

36:25.000 --> 36:29.000
We didn't have a problem doing a CAPTCHA because most of the time it's like 5-10 seconds at the most.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
It's just like click on the picture.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
Okay done.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
And this shit was just it was broken.

36:34.000 --> 36:40.000
Like you could tell like there'd be stuff like and it was like it's all of them were cars or street signs or pictures of streets.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
It's like okay well here's a picture of a street sign.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
Is that still counted as a street?

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
Because I know it's a picture of a street.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
But you're showing me just the street sign.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
Is that line in the background?

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
Is that a street?

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
And so it was just all fucked up.

36:54.000 --> 36:58.000
And finally I got it to work after 30 minutes wasting the whole night doing this shit.

36:58.000 --> 37:01.000
And they come to find out it's laggy as fuck.

37:01.000 --> 37:05.000
I'm just like my internet is fucking great.

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
My network is great.

37:07.000 --> 37:10.000
My wife at the time because it took so long wasn't on Netflix.

37:10.000 --> 37:16.000
So there is no reason with gigabit ethernet that I shouldn't be able to stream this shit.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
Yet for some reason, nope.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
Not gonna fucking happen.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
I just don't know.

37:22.000 --> 37:25.000
So that wasn't a thing.

37:25.000 --> 37:31.000
So yeah I didn't get to really play a whole ton of stuff other than Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2.

37:31.000 --> 37:36.000
I did end up playing more of the stupid cell phone games.

37:36.000 --> 37:42.000
Ironically enough not any Animal Crossing because honestly I was bored of that game after 5 minutes.

37:42.000 --> 37:45.000
Like I played it and I'm like okay this is what this game is gonna be.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
I can't see myself doing this.

37:47.000 --> 37:52.000
I can't see myself just going and gathering stuff to make furniture that I don't give a shit about.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
I can't play this anymore.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
And so that's kind of where that was.

37:56.000 --> 38:00.000
But yet I'll play this stupid fucking office space clicker game that gets fucking worse.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
Everybody has their weakness.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
All the time.

38:03.000 --> 38:10.000
It just gets fucking more and more complicated and just like watch more ads bullshit.

38:10.000 --> 38:13.000
But it's like oh give me more of that.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
I can't stop playing that.

38:16.000 --> 38:21.000
And no VR games because once again I just was too lazy to set it up.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
If I'm going to I want to.

38:23.000 --> 38:30.000
It's like the other day I was like should I play Lego Marvel Super Heroes or all these VR games I haven't.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
I don't know which VR game I want to play.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
I'm just gonna go play Lego Marvel Super Heroes.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
That's how I did it.

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
That's it.

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
Alright.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
My gaming week.

38:40.000 --> 38:46.000
Honestly not a whole lot besides my usual cell phone stuff with with Ingress and Pokemon Go.

38:46.000 --> 38:51.000
Which both of those games are having double experience events going on right now.

38:51.000 --> 38:55.000
And I actually find I'm kind of grinding Pokemon Go a little harder than Ingress.

38:55.000 --> 38:59.000
But Pokemon Go is nice because the Pokemon are kind of everywhere.

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
Whereas Ingress you have to you know go to specific places.

39:01.000 --> 39:05.000
So Pokemon you can kind of open the app and play at home for a little bit.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
I try to do both.

39:07.000 --> 39:11.000
Obviously I try to do both and you know I will go out on walks and things.

39:11.000 --> 39:16.000
And there's you know places near where I work where there's both portals and Pokestops.

39:16.000 --> 39:20.000
And I will use my little you know Bluetooth device to play both games at the same time.

39:20.000 --> 39:25.000
Now that I have the iPhone 10 I have much better luck playing two games at the same time that way.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
So it does allow me to do that.

39:27.000 --> 39:32.000
But I haven't been particularly motivated to like because I'm in that stage in Ingress where I'm level 15 but not 16.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
And like 16 is as high as you can go.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
It's like the highest you can possibly go.

39:36.000 --> 39:39.000
It's not like okay I hit level 16 then what.

39:39.000 --> 39:45.000
Like once you hit level what is it now 10 and you can submit your own portals and rate the other portals.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
Maybe that's 12 I don't remember.

39:47.000 --> 39:51.000
Well yeah they did the rate thing that was a while ago then they just added where you can submit stuff now.

39:51.000 --> 39:55.000
Yeah once you hit that point it's like well I can do everything I need to do.

39:55.000 --> 40:00.000
So the rest of it is just but I mean not to say like you know I still have fun playing the game.

40:00.000 --> 40:07.000
And once in a while you know I'll need that Zen moment of leaving the house and making fields in the neighborhood.

40:07.000 --> 40:15.000
Do the batches that you get from the yearly things do those count towards your badge counts on Ingress for levels and stuff.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
Yes.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
Sweet I'm going to get the level up.

40:18.000 --> 40:22.000
Oh why because you're getting a gold badge and it's like the one thing holding you back.

40:22.000 --> 40:23.000
Platinum or something.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.000
Nice. Yeah yeah.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.000
Oh that's funny.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
Alright I'll be 13.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
Congrats.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
Alright but then Pokemon.

40:30.000 --> 40:34.000
Then Pokemon has the new thing which I know we'll talk about later in the show quickly.

40:34.000 --> 40:38.000
But you know I yeah that game's still fun and I'm grinding that.

40:38.000 --> 40:43.000
Actually I will say this because I'm what I'm level 35 I think in Pokemon Go.

40:43.000 --> 40:51.000
So what I want to do is I do want to hit both level 16 in Ingress and level 40 in Pokemon Go.

40:51.000 --> 40:56.000
And then I should get some type of certificate for that for like sickest individual alive right.

40:56.000 --> 41:01.000
Wouldn't I get some type of acknowledgement for like like you have an AR disease.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
Congratulations.

41:02.000 --> 41:03.000
Like maybe that'll be a thing.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
So there you go.

41:05.000 --> 41:08.000
But I have been playing at home.

41:08.000 --> 41:11.000
I've still been playing Heroes of the Storm which I play.

41:11.000 --> 41:15.000
I try to do my daily gold matches every day to get my daily gold.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
I finally threw him money.

41:17.000 --> 41:25.000
I finally gave them money just because I've been playing the game so much and I fucking wanted Junkrat.

41:25.000 --> 41:28.000
So I bought him with real money.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
So there I got suckered into it.

41:30.000 --> 41:35.000
But it was a free game and it's I've played it for many many hours so I don't feel that bad doing it.

41:35.000 --> 41:39.000
And then another game of course I got suckered back into playing I think I talked about this last week.

41:39.000 --> 41:44.000
I started playing World of Warcraft and actually I've been playing it like a lot.

41:44.000 --> 41:47.000
Are you on the regular server.

41:47.000 --> 41:54.000
No I am no I went I went somewhere and I rolled just to be somewhere like I'm not playing with anybody.

41:54.000 --> 41:58.000
So because I'll be honest I actually might be re upping.

41:58.000 --> 41:59.000
Oh there you go.

41:59.000 --> 42:11.000
It's I don't know like I've been playing and there's there's things I like and I really like what I'm hearing about this next patch they're going to do which is where it's not going to like all the questing is going to scale.

42:11.000 --> 42:18.000
Like that was the best part of the expansion is how the quest in the new zones scaled you remember that and like so it didn't matter which zone you did you just go did what you want.

42:18.000 --> 42:21.000
They're doing that for all the zones.

42:21.000 --> 42:22.000
So like.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.000
That'll be great.

42:23.000 --> 42:28.000
You can it's you level 0 to 60 in any classic wow zone.

42:28.000 --> 42:33.000
If you want to go straight to fucking swamp of sorrows and start your new character you can do that.

42:33.000 --> 42:38.000
You you're going to have the level scaling and then I think it's 60 to 80.

42:38.000 --> 42:45.000
You can do either Northrend or the Burning Crusade content.

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
No good nor Northrend that's amazing.

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
Yeah you could skip one or the other altogether.

42:49.000 --> 42:53.000
For me I really like the music in Northrend so I'd rather just music but I hate the questing.

42:53.000 --> 42:58.000
Yeah so except for the Zandalari and then I think they're combining cataclysm and pandaria.

42:58.000 --> 43:01.000
I think will be eight which is great because cataclysm fucking blows.

43:01.000 --> 43:02.000
Sorry.

43:02.000 --> 43:05.000
So well panda isn't much better but those quests are better so I would do those.

43:05.000 --> 43:06.000
And then yes.

43:06.000 --> 43:10.000
And then you have the normal world trainer and stuff so I think that's really cool what they're doing.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
But don't get me wrong.

43:12.000 --> 43:15.000
I'm still a big big fan of Final Fantasy 14.

43:15.000 --> 43:19.000
It's just somehow I've now been suckered into paying for two MMOs.

43:19.000 --> 43:24.000
I bought one month of WoW and I thought maybe I could make enough gold to pay for another month.

43:24.000 --> 43:25.000
We'll see.

43:25.000 --> 43:31.000
But playing WoW does make me realize oh these are the things that I kind of like better in Final Fantasy 14.

43:31.000 --> 43:34.000
Like I actually think I like running dungeons better in 14.

43:34.000 --> 43:41.000
But then when I play WoW I'm also like but these are the it seems like there's kind of more to do in endgame in WoW than there is in Final Fantasy 14.

43:41.000 --> 43:44.000
That was the thing that let me lead 14.

43:44.000 --> 43:48.000
There was just not there was jack shit to do once you were done with the main stuff.

43:48.000 --> 43:53.000
They saw that they added the ability to play songs as a bard now.

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
Yeah that was something they added in 14.

43:55.000 --> 44:00.000
I haven't really played around with that yet but yeah the whole perform thing where you can like make your own songs.

44:00.000 --> 44:01.000
That's kind of neat.

44:01.000 --> 44:06.000
But you know Final Fantasy 14 kind of needs just a few more things like that and it'll it'll be.

44:06.000 --> 44:10.000
Well I and I will say I think I but this is personal opinion.

44:10.000 --> 44:13.000
I think the story in 14 is still superior.

44:13.000 --> 44:19.000
Like I think the Heavensward and especially Stormblood like those stories are so fucking good.

44:19.000 --> 44:25.000
Like they're better than just about almost any other game in the Final Fantasy like franchise.

44:25.000 --> 44:26.000
It's that good.

44:26.000 --> 44:30.000
So it definitely beats WoW but that's a personal thing.

44:30.000 --> 44:37.000
I also know some people that are super gung ho about Blizzard that love the story in World of Warcraft and can't really get into Final Fantasy the same way.

44:37.000 --> 44:42.000
And it just goes back to money for Leaf tickets or money for Pokeballs.

44:42.000 --> 44:45.000
What is what is your preference you know whatever you want to do.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
So anyway that's that's our business.

44:47.000 --> 44:51.000
I'm up to level 67 on my resto druid.

44:51.000 --> 44:56.000
I just started what like a week and a half ago is whenever I got back from Seattle about a week and a half ago.

44:56.000 --> 44:59.000
So I'm making pretty good progress I think.

45:00.000 --> 45:03.000
SSJ100Matt in chat says time to bring out.

45:03.000 --> 45:04.000
Excuse me.

45:04.000 --> 45:08.000
SSJ100Matt in chat says time to bring back courthouse.

45:08.000 --> 45:11.000
That's funny.

45:11.000 --> 45:14.000
As far as the other thing goes I'm loving these names for the certificates.

45:14.000 --> 45:18.000
JD in chat suggests you've kept Niantic afloat.

45:18.000 --> 45:21.000
Actf says Niantic still exists because of people like you badge.

45:21.000 --> 45:26.000
I forgot to mention there is a huge Ingress event in San Francisco on Saturday.

45:26.000 --> 45:35.000
So that's like another thing. So I'm I'm actually legit concerned I might be late to next week's show because of said event.

45:35.000 --> 45:38.000
So if the show doesn't start at six I apologize.

45:41.000 --> 45:45.000
Or Jamie will just have to figure out what button she's got to push to make it start.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
But Alan will be here to let you guys in.

45:47.000 --> 45:51.000
So no I'm really I'm not thinking that will actually happen but it might.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
So we'll see.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
Anyway there we go.

45:56.000 --> 45:59.000
Let's get into some other housekeeping.

46:01.000 --> 46:07.000
We're still going to be here for the next few weeks but Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve are both on Sundays.

46:07.000 --> 46:14.000
So I highly doubt we're going to have live shows either of those nights because I'm pretty sure I have to do my family stuff on Christmas Eve.

46:14.000 --> 46:19.000
And Jamie I know even though you're Jewish dance family you celebrate with them Christmas Eve right?

46:19.000 --> 46:20.000
Kinda.

46:20.000 --> 46:21.000
Yeah so.

46:21.000 --> 46:25.000
We usually just do Christmas Eve stuff and then Christmas Day stuff if I'm not working.

46:25.000 --> 46:26.000
Yeah.

46:26.000 --> 46:27.000
And I think I'm working.

46:27.000 --> 46:28.000
So we're probably.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
Actually no.

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
I may be on leave.

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
Oh right right. Yeah yeah yeah.

46:34.000 --> 46:35.000
Yeah.

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
Well regardless. Oh yeah.

46:37.000 --> 46:44.000
And by the way we're not going to say too much about it but Jamie's going to be absent from the show for a couple of weeks due to some other stuff.

46:44.000 --> 46:49.000
So we're talking about like I think doing maybe an early show on like New Year's.

46:49.000 --> 46:50.000
Maybe New Year's Eve.

46:50.000 --> 46:54.000
A lot of that's going to depend on on her and her schedule.

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
OK so we'll let you know.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
Right Jamie.

46:58.000 --> 47:04.000
Well and if if anyone who I trust well enough wants to ask me what's going on I'll probably tell you.

47:04.000 --> 47:05.000
Yeah.

47:05.000 --> 47:06.000
But nothing public.

47:06.000 --> 47:07.000
It's personal business is all they need.

47:07.000 --> 47:08.000
And it's not bad.

47:08.000 --> 47:09.000
And it's not bad.

47:09.000 --> 47:10.000
It's all they need to know.

47:10.000 --> 47:11.000
No.

47:11.000 --> 47:12.000
All right.

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
Anyway I think that's it for housekeeping.

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
I'm just having cybernetic parts put in.

47:16.000 --> 47:22.000
She literally is going to be the bionic woman now because I am calling her Jamie Summers since you know the beginning of time.

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
So she's getting the implants.

47:24.000 --> 47:25.000
Yep.

47:25.000 --> 47:28.000
I'm going to get the leg and the arm and the eyes.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
She's going to get a leg just like Rose McGowan.

47:30.000 --> 47:33.000
And what was that movie where the grand house.

47:33.000 --> 47:34.000
Yes.

47:34.000 --> 47:35.000
Planet Terror.

47:35.000 --> 47:36.000
Yes.

47:36.000 --> 47:37.000
Planet Terror.

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
You know I actually saw a really.

47:39.000 --> 47:42.000
Next time Loki's critical and Nintendo.

47:42.000 --> 47:47.000
I really I saw the good Halloween costume of an amputee who did that.

47:47.000 --> 47:48.000
Perfect.

47:48.000 --> 47:49.000
Perfect.

47:49.000 --> 47:50.000
Yeah.

47:50.000 --> 47:51.000
All right.

47:51.000 --> 47:55.000
Let's get into some gaming news Loki.

47:55.000 --> 48:05.000
So as we kind of mentioned when we're talking a little bit about the whole net neutrality and loot boxing certain countries and states have kind of weighed in on the whole loot box stuff.

48:05.000 --> 48:21.000
So one of the states actually kind of came out and made a comment about it was of course Chris Lee from Hawaii who actually was making an announcement talking about that loot boxes demonstrate predatory behavior and that they want to combat that.

48:21.000 --> 48:36.000
And of course you know they're talking about you know basically saying the EA is being very predatory towards people saying that this is like a Star Wars themed online casino designed to lure kids in the spending money.

48:36.000 --> 48:40.000
And it's a trap because that's totally a Star Wars thing to say.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
You have to say it's a trap as a trap.

48:42.000 --> 48:45.000
Thank you Loki.

48:45.000 --> 48:48.000
You don't look quite like an encephalopod though.

48:48.000 --> 48:51.000
That's a compliment.

48:51.000 --> 48:58.000
I look like a homeless person earlier today and I get shaved.

48:58.000 --> 48:59.000
But yes.

48:59.000 --> 49:09.000
So of course you know they're going to look into that to see what they could do to maybe help you if it comes down to fighting it including blocking a regulation.

49:09.000 --> 49:21.000
Along with that other countries have weighed in Belgium was one that actually they had a kind of a translation from an article saying that you know they saw them as demonstrating while it's not exactly gambling.

49:21.000 --> 49:31.000
It does demonstrate a lot of the same things that you would see with gambling having that same kind of appeal as people would to like different gambling games.

49:31.000 --> 49:35.000
France has come out as well against it saying that.

49:35.000 --> 49:40.000
Basically that they're also you know very predatory.

49:40.000 --> 49:51.000
One of the things they were talking about was I guess the A.R. J.L. which is a French organization that regulates online gambling.

49:51.000 --> 50:03.000
Basically a letter from French Senator Jerome during basically said that you know they wanted them to look into this because you know.

50:03.000 --> 50:14.000
Since there has been such an advancement of gaming culture basically talking about you know e-sports and microtransactions the blue boxes seeing whether or not that they.

50:15.000 --> 50:31.000
These need to be regulated like online gambling because of you know the way that you know people are spending money on this and see he wants to see you kind of like how China's done were more transparency in the drop rates to help players.

50:31.000 --> 50:35.000
You make more informed decisions and.

50:35.000 --> 50:41.000
You know also just kind of making sure that they're not doing anything shady kind of like online gambling.

50:41.000 --> 50:50.000
Because yeah I mean if they're basically putting this out there in a way that they can kind of skirt around laws because you're buying fake currency to do this.

50:50.000 --> 51:04.000
That's it seems like that they shouldn't be able to get away with that because if you think about it like if I have you know if I'm trying to sell drugs which is obviously illegal but I say no no I'm not really selling drugs.

51:04.000 --> 51:12.000
I'm selling this picture that I drew on a piece of paper with a pencil and you're just getting the drugs for free with that drawing that I did.

51:12.000 --> 51:19.000
You can't do that it's still illegal you know even though I'm saying oh well I'm not selling the drugs I'm just selling this picture.

51:19.000 --> 51:27.000
Something similar that it's like oh no no we're not spending real money on it you just buy this fake currency that you then spend on the gambling.

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
It doesn't work that way.

51:29.000 --> 51:40.000
You wouldn't be able to buy like you know California crystals to buy California lottery tickets with if you're underage it's it doesn't work that way.

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
So I don't know.

51:42.000 --> 51:49.000
I definitely hope they look into this a little more because I'm all for them getting rid of this bullshit.

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
Do you think it's going to come to that regulation.

51:51.000 --> 51:56.000
Do you think if the gaming industry has a tendency to kind of back down.

51:56.000 --> 52:03.000
And I kind of think like I think this backlash that's happened against D.A. other companies have to be noticing it.

52:03.000 --> 52:07.000
Yeah I think that they definitely notice it and it definitely will have an impact on it.

52:07.000 --> 52:12.000
But like a lot of the times you know where they say they need this for development you know costs and stuff like that.

52:12.000 --> 52:15.000
Look at EA's direct words what they are talking about.

52:15.000 --> 52:21.000
They mentioned to their investors about they're saying that this is going to have no financial impact on them.

52:21.000 --> 52:25.000
You know the fact that they're you know removing these temporarily.

52:25.000 --> 52:31.000
So if it's going to have no financial impact on them then why did they need to be there in the first place.

52:31.000 --> 52:34.000
Obviously they make more money so they could do it without it.

52:34.000 --> 52:38.000
It's just they want to do it with it because they're going to make more money.

52:38.000 --> 52:42.000
I don't know. I think if they keep pushing it keeps moving in this direction.

52:42.000 --> 52:46.000
Obviously now they kind of took too much of a leap.

52:46.000 --> 52:55.000
But if it keeps if they still try to inch it out even further then yeah there's gonna be more backlash with it including you know now that it's gotten mainstream press and stuff.

52:55.000 --> 53:00.000
More regulation you know regulatory bodies looking at this type of stuff.

53:00.000 --> 53:06.000
I think it is going to come to the point where they're going to have to be transparent about the percentages of drop rates and these things.

53:07.000 --> 53:15.000
How about stop being fucking assholes about it and just if you want to sell DLC sell DLC.

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
That's fine.

53:17.000 --> 53:24.000
But the fact that you have a random loot drop that's fine if it's an in-game thing like Borderlands.

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
Random loot drops all day long.

53:26.000 --> 53:33.000
But that's in-game that's part of the game it's not this like I have to spend money to buy loot boxes.

53:33.000 --> 53:36.000
Which God forbid you know take two.

53:36.000 --> 53:43.000
Well probably we'll see that in Borderlands 3 but you know it's it's not necessary.

53:43.000 --> 53:50.000
It's definitely no one's going to look at it and go oh they're not trying to make money off this.

53:50.000 --> 53:56.000
I mean obviously they're trying to make money off this and the fact that it's random is so that you're not guaranteed to get what you want in it.

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
So that you will spend more money on it.

53:58.000 --> 54:03.000
And that's they're not selling a service they're selling just like a lottery which is gambling.

54:03.000 --> 54:06.000
Is it weird to hear lawmakers talking about this.

54:06.000 --> 54:07.000
Do you think they'll get it right.

54:07.000 --> 54:14.000
Because I noticed what's you know something that we kind of have to get used to is that it kind of felt like in the 90s like lawmakers didn't play video games.

54:14.000 --> 54:15.000
They were in touch with it.

54:15.000 --> 54:22.000
But now you know you know 30 and 40 some things we grew up on video games everybody kind of knows what Nintendo is at this point.

54:22.000 --> 54:23.000
I don't think they'll get it right.

54:23.000 --> 54:32.000
And unfortunately for them that's going to work against the gaming industry because the way they're going to perceive it because people say that it's like gambling is they're going to call it an online casino.

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
Star Wars themed online casino.

54:34.000 --> 54:35.000
And if that happens then it's done.

54:35.000 --> 54:36.000
Loot boxes are gone.

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
I mean that's going to happen.

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
They'll be gone from Overwatch too.

54:40.000 --> 54:48.000
Which is going to be because you know again Blizzard seems immune from all this because you know to be fair because it's it's cosmetic.

54:48.000 --> 54:58.000
You know and I'm sorry if they get caught in the crossfire with it but you know what Activision Blizzard you're not you're not 100 percent innocent.

54:58.000 --> 54:59.000
You guys said that.

54:59.000 --> 55:11.000
I mean it may not necessarily be as much on the Blizzard side of things but Activision they have their fair share of bullshit that they've been pulling with the loot box stuff so they are equally the blame for this.

55:11.000 --> 55:16.000
And I'm sorry if it comes to that we're all loot boxes basically are just gone.

55:16.000 --> 55:19.000
Well you know what you kind of have yourself the blame for it.

55:19.000 --> 55:25.000
All right I don't want to rehash the loot box thing too much more unless Jamie you want to add something because you were here last week for the big kickoff topic on that.

55:25.000 --> 55:34.000
But if you do want to email us of course you can always continue the conversation if you want it's your show participate at orange launcher dot com if you want to send us an email.

55:34.000 --> 55:38.000
But I will point this out because this is an interesting kind of other side of things.

55:38.000 --> 55:43.000
Now this is a game that was a whole free to play thing that both Loki and I have talked about.

55:43.000 --> 55:50.000
God ad nauseum on this show. Yes a little game called Clicker Heroes. Remember when we were all into Clicker Heroes.

55:50.000 --> 55:55.000
Well I didn't know that did you know Clicker Heroes to get in a fucking sequel because of course it is.

55:55.000 --> 56:05.000
Of course it is right. But here's the interesting thing about it. So with Clicker Heroes to play source has decided you know what we're getting rid of the free to play Ruby mechanic.

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
We're getting rid of it.

56:07.000 --> 56:13.000
And if you don't know what the Ruby mechanic is once in a great while a Ruby will drop that you can click.

56:13.000 --> 56:23.000
And then you use the rubies to buy premium stuff. But of course if you want to just buy what is it like 10 rubies for ninety nine cents or whatever it is I don't know the exact ratio you can do that.

56:23.000 --> 56:30.000
And that's with the PC version the PlayStation version all the version which makes sense because of the free free game right. It was a free to play game to be fair.

56:30.000 --> 56:40.000
What is Mr. Smoosh. What do you do. Oh God. Hold on guys. Mr. Smoosh has one of my free chisel toys from. Yeah. Remember chisel is for the cat.

56:40.000 --> 56:47.000
I know things are for the cat. I know but I don't want him to destroy that. That's like a keepsake at this point. OK Mr. Smoosh don't tear that up. OK OK.

56:47.000 --> 56:53.000
Shall I just go into my story. Not yet.

56:53.000 --> 57:03.000
All right. So yeah. So basically instead of going the whole free to play route they're actually going to be you know charging money up front and not having all of that free to play stuff.

57:03.000 --> 57:13.000
So they're going to actually charge thirty dollars for the sequel which that's interesting. I'd be curious to see how the game plays.

57:13.000 --> 57:20.000
Yeah. I'm looking at the screenshots and it looks like they tried to take a little more like it looks a little more Diablo esque in the way at least that it looks.

57:20.000 --> 57:36.000
But I can't see how the main game mechanics are going to change that much. So we'll see. But what's also interesting about it is they basically said the developer PlaySource kind of says you know we've made a lot of money off of what they call the whales which are you know the free to play mechanics.

57:36.000 --> 57:46.000
But they said we don't want this kind of money if it came from anyone who regrets their decision if it made their lives significantly worse as a result.

57:46.000 --> 57:54.000
We really don't like making money off players who are in denial of their addiction. And that's what a large part of free to play gaming is all about.

57:54.000 --> 58:02.000
Everyone in the industry seems to rationalize it by shifting the blame assuming way too much cognizance on the part of their victims.

58:02.000 --> 58:09.000
So isn't that interesting that they're coming out and basically saying people are addicted to this shit and we don't want to enable it anymore.

58:09.000 --> 58:19.000
I can see that. I mean it the clicker games are quite addicting. I I've never been compelled to buy currency though in it. So there's that.

58:19.000 --> 58:29.000
But you know I'm willing to pay for their game if it's if it's decent. I can't really tell based on the screenshots but it's fun for a while.

58:29.000 --> 58:36.000
I don't know. I mean I I spent ten dollars on the rubies at one point but that was more of a it wasn't that I needed to do it.

58:36.000 --> 58:44.000
That was more of a and that's all I ever spent was ten bucks. It was more of a I wanted to pay something to the developers for like all the hours I spent playing the game.

58:44.000 --> 58:52.000
I was kind of like you know they deserve a little kickback and sure getting the double gems power up or whatever the fuck I bought right away.

58:52.000 --> 59:03.000
That's a nice little kick too. But that's it. Like I'm only ever going to spend ten dollars on this whereas like seriously don't ask me how much I've spent on Pokemon Go or how much gas I've put in my car because of Ingress like just don't don't ask.

59:03.000 --> 59:18.000
I won't tell you. Yeah I mean it's fine. I don't have a problem supporting developers like this and it's good to see that these people even like someone that like it would be very easy for them to just you know keep the same thing and they could defend it with saying listen it's a free play game.

59:19.000 --> 59:29.000
Yeah I mean it's kind of hard to argue that but the fact that they're saying listen now we don't want to kind of we've kind of thought about it and we don't want to be a part of this problem.

59:29.000 --> 59:40.000
You know that that's might I guess that's pretty noble of them I guess but I think that maybe they've determined like that the average amount people spent was 30 bucks and probably they probably could make more money.

59:40.000 --> 59:56.000
Well I just I worry for them because well maybe maybe not. I mean if the average was 30 bucks and they sell a lot of copies of it then they'll make the same amount of money. I kind of don't think they will sell. I think 30 bucks for this type of game is going to be a stretch and it's going to be the type of thing that ends up on steam sales.

59:56.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Yeah I can see picking this up. I think most people will buy it for 10 bucks five the first steam sale opportunity. Yeah but I mean maybe you know again I eventually dropped 10 dollars on clicker heroes so if I drop 10 bucks on this then they made the same money off of me on either game so who knows.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Dungeon buster in chat says I heard about this story pretty bold move but their reasoning was also very interesting.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Bobby Blackwolf asks so serious question how much have you spent on Pokemon go. I there's honestly a part of me that says I don't have to answer this question.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.000
I plead the fifth.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Do we count the devices that I bought like the Pokemon go plus and gotcha.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Although the gotcha was a gift. So do I really count that. I'm probably not easily while this game has been out a year and a half easily two hundred fifty dollars.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:11.000
But how much have I paid for my Final Fantasy 14 subscription in that same time.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Probably about the same. I would say I spend about as much on this game as I do on an MMO subscription and it's it's kind of a similar thing.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:30.000
You know it's interesting though I've spent more money on Pokemon that I have in ingress to which Niantic actually gets the money if that makes sense.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:35.000
I mean because I put gas in my car but Niantic doesn't fucking get anything from that right right.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:49.000
And Niantic. Oh to be honest they don't really sell them. I know I've bought ten dollars. No I think I gave the game twenty dollars to buy the ten dollars worth of capsules and maybe like one set of frackers ever.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:02:02.000
But I also bought a very rare kit when I went to their anomaly. So I would say maybe over the four years I played ingress a hundred dollars tops tops on money that Niantic actually gets a part of it.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:12.000
I think I spent maybe like 20 bucks and all of that was from the free Google survey thing where you get money from doing their surveys.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000
So technically no money but you know.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says I only ask that because you said don't even ask me I didn't think it would work. Well there you don't say I don't do things for listeners.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Rageinator says so multiply by 10 to get the real amount then. No I was I was honest with you. It's about ten dollars probably about ten dollars a month and then you figure it was thirty dollars for the first device about forty dollars the second.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Maybe a little extra money during one of the events I'd say 250 is a fair guesstimate because that game's only been out about a year and a half.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:47.000
So I bet some people have spent more.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:59.000
But see that's the thing is like you know like I don't have a problem with people spending that kind of money on these games because it's not that much when you're talking about the length of time that you've had the game and I can't really wants that food.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Mr. Smudge is being as I'm eating fish cake.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
He probably thinks it's kitty soft food.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:11.000
That's my pop.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Poor Mr. Smudge.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Okay a little bit for you.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Jamie Jamie stuck out hurt like she put just a little tiny piece in her hand to give to Mr. Smudge and like while her hand was out he fucking jumps around it up on the table and sticks his nose.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Okay.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Anyway sorry cats.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:46.000
But anyways yeah so like I don't have a problem people doing that but it's like what's when you try to shapely do that after like you know like E.A. for example when you're trying to you know oh we're going to charge you sixty dollars for the game and we want you to still pay this hundred you know ten dollars a month as well.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.000
It's like no.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Come on.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:58.000
All right well we'll move on to our soccer if you're able to keep Mr. Smoosh at bay there to get to our next story.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Oh my God.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
I'm I'm eating like this.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.000
You're distracted.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.000
Go fish.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.000
No.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.000
No.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Do you need me to go put him away.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.000
Poke poke poke.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.000
No I'm just gonna keep poking at his paws.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.000
That's what I do with Midna.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Okay.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:14.000
So basically we have some ass hole ishness.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Basically the developer gazillion who does Marvel heroes.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.000
No.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Gee smooshy.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.000
You're pushy smooshy.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.000
That's what you are.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Okay I'm gonna put him away if he's too distracted.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.000
No no no.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Okay.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:32.000
So anyway basically everyone at gazillion got laid off.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
They were supposed to get laid off at the end of December.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Well this happened right before Thanksgiving.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.000
If that is not the dick move of dick moves then I don't know.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
I hope they got paid through whenever.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:45.000
I heard they weren't even getting like PTO cashed out and all sorts of like.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.000
That is bullshit.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:49.000
We went fucking broke today type of shit.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.000
That is bullshit.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Yeah.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.000
It's really unfortunate.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Yeah so anyway a good number of players of the game have already started asking for refunds

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:02.000
because it's been less than six months you know and they are well within their rights.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:07.000
So I hope that they can get the money but then again you can't get blood out of a stone

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.000
so.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Yeah like if they couldn't even pay their employees PTO like you're not getting money

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.000
without a lawsuit.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Like it's just not going to happen unless they run it up the flagpole and go all the

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.000
way to Disney.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:23.000
And if it starts to become an ugly PR thing for Disney who let's not forget owns Marvel

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:27.000
if it becomes an ugly PR thing for Disney then maybe something will happen.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Disney doesn't own the developer.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.000
It doesn't matter though.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.000
They pulled the license.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
I would still have their fault.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.000
It's still it's still an image thing.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:41.000
And you know if if the whole backlash with Star Wars Battlefront 2 is anything just just

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:46.000
copying Disney on any all your complaints and I think you might get better traction

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
that way.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Well they have the money for it so no one's really worried.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:56.000
They'll just up theme park prices again.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.000
All right.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Well in all seriousness you know that is really unfortunate to those developers and so we're

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:06.000
thinking of the developers and hope that they can find new employment.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:11.000
And it's one of those few times you see the really good side of Twitter is that I did

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:15.000
notice there were gaming companies like you know Blizzard and like there were some other

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:19.000
companies like right away were like hey if you were impacted by what happened to Gazillion

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
we're hiring for these positions right now.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:22.000
Call us here.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Email us here.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:27.000
So at least there's like yay that's the good part of social networking.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:34.000
So you know we really hope the folks at Gazillion can land face up somewhere that doesn't completely

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:38.000
ruin the holiday for every door that closes another opens et cetera et cetera.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Let's hope that that works out.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.000
All right.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Moving on.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.000
Another story Loki.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:49.000
So apparently Bungie has announced that they're changing the way that they're handling Destiny

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
2's experience points.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:57.000
And this I guess comes after some players had raised questions about how the system

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.000
was rigged.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:05.000
So you know basically like any other game you would earn experience points and you after

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:11.000
you get so much XP you level up and then once you get to level 20 which is like a your soft

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:18.000
cap they call it then you get a bright Ingram every time your experience bar fills up.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:23.000
And so with that you can buy loot boxes and whatnot.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:29.000
However they I guess had this event called Clarion Call I guess which gave bonus XP to

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:35.000
players when when they were joined by at least one of their clan mates.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:40.000
And they were saying that during the event some players noticed that the longer they

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:45.000
played the slower they'd progress despite the fact that they were repeating the same

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.000
activities.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:51.000
So the first time player would earn like 5000 XP and then they would see that you know

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:58.000
large chunk of XP bar fill in the second or third 15th time they earned the same number

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:02.000
of XP but the bar would fill even smaller.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:07.000
So it was like a curve like that the bar was filling like at a curve rate.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Yeah.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:13.000
So instead of it being you know where it was supposed to be you know this constant leveling

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:19.000
they were kind of tweaking it a bit to make it so that you earn those bright Ingram's

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:23.000
i.e. loot boxes slower and slower.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:28.000
If it was just doing that with experience points I would have no problem with it.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Or it's like the gas meter in my car in reverse where like it doesn't go down like for the

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:37.000
longest time I'll drive around and it's like my gas meter doesn't go down at all and then

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:42.000
all of a sudden I'll be like on a quarter tank and just like runs to empty all of a

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.000
sudden.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.000
So it's the reverse of that.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Well I mean I'm glad they are putting a stop to it because that's pretty shady.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Like how do you even how do you even justify that.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Yeah.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:56.000
And their comment was you know we've seen the community discussion around XP gain and

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.000
destiny after reviewing our data we agree that the system is not performing the way

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.000
we'd like it to.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:05.000
In other words you guys notice today we'd like to describe what's going on under the

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:10.000
hood and talk about what you can expect going forward with earning XP and destiny too.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:15.000
How about just make the bar an accurate representation of percentages.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Like is that too much to ask.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Like I'm sorry.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Do you know how much fucking like corporate speak was just in those words that came out

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:26.000
of your mouth that literally meant like and I'm not blaming you.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
That literally meant like oh we got caught.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Oops.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Well literally the explanation too doesn't make any sense either because it says currently

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:38.000
XP will scale up when playing longer or fixed duration activities like crucible competitive

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:44.000
multiplayer matches or Leviathan raids and says and XP will scale down when playing activities

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:48.000
that can be quickly repeatedly chain like public like grinding public events.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:52.000
We're not happy with the results and we've heard the same from the community.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Oh fuck you.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
We're not happy with the result.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.000
Oh my God.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.000
This system is failing us.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Bullshit.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
You're unhappy that people notice and complained about it.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:05.000
And this is why I never got to level 20 because I never had to see any of this stuff.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
I fooled you.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.000
It's I'm sorry.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Like I always like I always get like miffed when they just say oh yes you know we're disappointed

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:19.000
in the way you know we're disappointed in you know the data that we've used.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Do you fucking program the game.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
You can't tell me you didn't know what was going on.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
You had to plan the system out.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:31.000
So you know full well how the system was working and it's just that oh you got caught.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:36.000
And so now it's like oh well we're disappointed in ourselves.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.000
We'll do better next time.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
No you won't.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.000
You won't.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
I'm glad I never played it.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.000
What's up.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Destiny 2 is like it's a beautiful game.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
You know the little bits I have played on PC.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:52.000
It's a gorgeous game and it is you know for somebody who doesn't even really care for shooters that much.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:53.000
It is kind of fun.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:57.000
But all this endgame bullshit really sounds exhausting.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Well it just sounds to me that they want people to earn those bright Ingram slower so that you get tempted to buy loot boxes.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
Could be that's what I think it is.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:13.000
That's how you earn loot boxes in Overwatch is you learn earn them as you gain experience playing matches.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:20.000
But like Blizzard didn't feel the need to fucking lie on the bar about what percentage you are to a certain level.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:23.000
It's just so weird to me.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Like who who thought that was a good idea and that they wouldn't get caught with all this.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:33.000
Like hey you know if you play this event you'll get near the full experience you play it again it's going to go down or something like that.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:36.000
And people are at least are aware of it.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Well here's a publisher that's been doing something and has not been quote unquote caught until now.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
But this is a very different type of situation.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.000
This is the one that kind of makes you go wow.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
And this has to do with the game Axiom Verge.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:55.000
And it came out this week that the publisher who's Badland Games has been doing something for Tom Happ.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Who I believe is the creator the like the soul dude behind like these games.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:03.000
So anyhow Tom said in a passage here.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:07.000
I'd like to take a moment to give a special shout out to the publisher Badland.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
As you may have seen elsewhere on my blog and Twitter.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
I try to be pretty open about my son's health situation.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:18.000
In short he was born healthy but the doctors failed to treat a routine case of jaundice during a critical period when he was just days old.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:22.000
The result was a lifelong condition called connectoris.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
I may or may not have pronounced that right.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:30.000
That is characterized by severe neurological damage which robbed my son of how much of much of his motor control and hearing.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:34.000
The reason I mention this is that after we decide to move forward with Badland Games as the publisher.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:41.000
They offered to donate 75% of their share to a special fund dedicated to Alistair's ongoing health care costs.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:48.000
They didn't want to publicize it since none of us wanted to be seen as trying to use my son's suffering as a marketing tool for the game.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:51.000
I hope this doesn't come across that come off that way.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:57.000
I just wanted to thank them for their generosity and offering that up since it was definitely something they didn't have to do.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:02.000
And so a lot of people have kind of gone well I'm gonna buy a second copy after hear about that.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
So good guy publisher Badland Games.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Yeah my first game was good.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Oh yeah that game's great.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Axiom Verge is great especially if you kind of have that itch with Super Metroid that kind of needs to be scratched.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:15.000
It's a great great game you definitely should check out.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:22.000
You know I have to admit though and I don't know if it's just like the internet womp womp part of me or the fact that I've worked in health care for the past few years.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:27.000
But my first thought was why are the health care companies not paying for this?

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:34.000
And that was kind of where my brain went. I was like why if you know everybody's supposed to have health care or you know there's always Medicaid or whatever.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:38.000
But I did research and I tried to figure out what's going on. It turns out it's because of the condition.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:41.000
I guess there's not a lot of...

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.000
I've heard of this.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:45.000
Yeah FDA or whoever approved stuff.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:53.000
So it sounds like the child's going to Mexico to get treatment where the industry is not as heavily regulated because this condition is so rare.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:14:00.000
So I will say I kind of put it under that eye and I was like okay this makes sense. I understand why they need to raise money.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Although they've been doing it quietly.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:13.000
The issue with this particular thing is it actually concerns the chemical that delivers that controls hemoglobin to deliver oxygen to the body.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:20.000
And it's an excess of that. So it's pretty pretty serious. So I hope that you can find the good treatment for it.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:28.000
Well I hope he's made lots of money for his son off of this game and I hope the son is able to get a little help there.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:33.000
And a lot of people have kind of gone that's why that game's never on sale.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Yeah so that might kind of explain it a little bit there.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:40.000
So anyhow there you go Axiom Verge a little news there with the publisher.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Let's move on.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Dar Sakura a few more stories then we'll get to the classic of the week.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:54.000
Well there's been a 20 month suspension of a League of Legends champion player named who goes by Vasily Lee Wei Jun.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:15:00.000
On his Twitch channel he screamed and threatened his girlfriend at the time.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:09.000
Overturned furniture and basically issued threats severe enough to warrant a visit from the police.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:18.000
And so just after that broadcast finished basically the team he was on ended their contract with him.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:22.000
They just booted him out. His girlfriend left him as well she should have.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:28.000
Although she said that he didn't beat her but he did smash everything around them.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:32.000
And that he did the whole thing on the live stream. So it is out there.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:44.000
And basically the League of Legends championship series said per their code of contact conduct sorry that he is under 20 months suspension.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:49.000
And that after that expires it's up to other league teams if they want to sign him.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:16:07.000
Although they do understand that he had a history with quote violent tendencies and that he showed physical aggression on stage by smashing a keyboard and intimidating a camera operator during a match.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:21.000
They are considering looking into lifelong bans for that but this is what gets me is that well I'm sorry an indefinite ban quote fingers.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:29.000
That they give indefinite bans for cheating you know for match fixing and cheating.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:35.000
But they didn't put it on there for threatening the well-being of another person.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:41.000
Yeah like you know with this whole story and what you're saying I was like okay okay okay okay like yep they're doing what they have to do.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:46.000
Up until this part where you said he'd he'd done this type of violent shit on stage before.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:54.000
Like this is an ambassador for your game and your brand on what is you know a very well watched thing on Twitch.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:17:00.000
And like you know I you know I don't know maybe that maybe the the media hasn't gotten as in depth to this.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:07.000
But like where was the fucking slap on the wrist when he was yelling at camera operators and smashing keyboards and shit.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:13.000
Like that should have been squelched then. That should have been a spanking then.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
Well I swear to God some people's children.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:22.000
But on top of that the other thing is that they're treating you know cheating as a bigger offense than threatening another person.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
Yeah yeah no I hear you loud and clear.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:32.000
But they did um Riot Games did admit that it it had a wide range of offenses that would be listed underneath it.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:38.000
And that they didn't anticipate having a situation where a pro player would turn out to be a domestic abuser.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:44.000
I'm gonna interject one thing here. Humans no matter what they do can be garbage.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:56.000
We have seen garbage like you know asshole from my state and Weinstein and all of those garbages out there being garbage.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:01.000
What's to say a gamer can't be garbage like this guy. This guy is garbage.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:05.000
And I'm I'm sorry they kind of had a hint.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
Yeah they knew.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:11.000
But no he's a game. No he's garbage.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:15.000
And he should have been treated like garbage and thrown out the first time he was acting like garbage.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Or rehabilitated and recycled into something usable.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:23.000
If he can even learn. I mean sometimes people who.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:24.000
That's up to the person.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:29.000
Yeah you have to want to change and if there's no incentive to change you're just going to keep being garbage.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
Sorry if they can get away with it.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:32.000
Because he was getting away with it.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Exactly.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:35.000
You need to hold.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:38.000
I'm sure he'll go to rehab. That's what everybody does now.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:42.000
You need to hold garbage people accountable for being garbage.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
End of story.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
That's. Mine's over.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
OK. All right.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:55.000
I don't know what else to say with that. I'm looking at our chat over at live dot vodka network dot com active says hasn't anyone learned from the fighting game community.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:59.000
Dungeon Buster says I'm surprised you get an indefinite ban right then and there.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
I think that's about the smash keyboards itself.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
William murder face says what's next.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:11.000
Someone says a slur one or the other at a tournament and Riot says they did not anticipate that could happen.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Well Riot games also didn't answer why they chose 20 months instead of indefinite.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:26.000
So but I mean having a policy that vague just opens the door for more abuses for things that people you have to have.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:32.000
This isn't somebody playing a match on like this isn't somebody like just a user of the game.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:35.000
This is a professional who's being paid to play this game.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
Exactly difference.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:55.000
And on top of that I mean if anything if he it should be something in the contract to there can be punitive damages for the I would expect like the negative PR that it gives the company you know that while you are playing this game you are a representative of the company.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:20:00.000
You know it's ridiculous but no he's garbage.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:01.000
All right.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:05.000
Well sometimes you have to just paint over the garbage right Loki.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
Yes you do.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:11.000
And way to transition into talking about Splatoon 2.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
I tried I really tried with that.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.000
You tried.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
Which is not hot garbage.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:17.000
No it's not.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
No it's a lot of fun actually.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Well actually Splatoon 2 did have a garbage weekend and it was that weekend that mayonnaise fucking one versus ketchup.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
That was the best week ever.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:28.000
That was garbage.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:29.000
Because ketchup is disgusting.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
No mayonnaise is actual garbage.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Mayonnaise is delicious.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:34.000
Anyway.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:42.000
Anyways so there Nintendo announced that they have quite a bit of updates coming soon to Splatoon 2.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:48.000
So one of these actually is coming in mid-December which is a brand new game mode called Clam Blitz.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:53.000
So in Clam Blitz you basically have to collect different clams that are scattered throughout the stage.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:21:01.000
And after you pick one up they'll follow the player around and then you have to get them into a basket that's near the opponent's base and they have like a shield around them.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:09.000
So in order to do that you collect 10 clams and then throw this power clam in there to basically score points on the first team to 100 wins.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:10.000
Yay.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:13.000
So that's interesting.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:17.000
And then along with that of course they've got some new stuff for new battle stages coming out.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:22.000
So they just released one this weekend with the shell.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:23.000
What was it?

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:24.000
Mako Mart.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:32.000
And then I guess Shellendorf Institute Walleye Warehouse and Arowana Mall are going to be coming soon.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:38.000
And I guess they're saying that there's going to be new salmon run stages as well.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:45.000
So I guess they're saying that the salmonoid smokeyard is going to be added to the rotation.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:46.000
They have new gear.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:49.000
So 140 pieces of new gear as well.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:55.000
Shoes, headgear, clothes and you know these additional winter clothing as well.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
New battle music.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:01.000
So they've got I guess they said two new bands in the game.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.000
New hairstyles.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
They have four new hairstyles.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
Two female, two male.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:10.000
They've raised the level cap from 50 to 99.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:18.000
And then I guess they also have the ability to I guess like prestige.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:25.000
You know they would call it in Call of Duty where you can reset your level and continue raising the level from there.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
New amiibo functions.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:32.000
So they're going to have I guess tapping the amiibo in the game will allow you to share in-game photos.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:37.000
And I don't know if it's done.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:38.000
Oh we can add filters and stuff.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
So we'll do those videos too I guess.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Probably too much for an amiibo.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:42.000
Yeah.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:48.000
And also I guess they're saying that they're going to allow you to swap gear a little bit easier.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:54.000
So you'll be able to change gear between battles in regular rattle ranked battle.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:55.000
Thanks God.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
That was oh my God.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
That was one of those things I couldn't believe wasn't in there.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
You could not change your gear between that.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:02.000
Thank God.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:03.000
Yeah.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:04.000
So that's cool.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
Didn't mention though if you need the app for that.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:10.000
Wasn't that one of the ways one of the things that the app was for is like switching gear.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.000
No you could.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:14.000
It was like additional gear you could buy and you could get it.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:22.000
I don't want to say the shady marketplace but it just kind of was you know it was just another way to buy gear basically and different stuff.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:25.000
And you can also see like what teams your friends are on and so forth.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:28.000
The chat room is saying that the update is live already by the way.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
This isn't something that is coming.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
It's done already here.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
Well yes some of the things I know that were coming.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:39.000
But they mentioned that you know one of the stages was released and then the rest were coming soon.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:40.000
Got it.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:41.000
So I didn't think it'd be like the very next day.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:45.000
Well then this is the good news that you know all of it's free essentially.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:50.000
And this is the good thing that Nintendo has not figured out loot boxes yet.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:51.000
Can't get that online.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:52.000
Am I right?

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:53.000
Yeah.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:54.000
All right.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:58.000
Act F says yeah you buy special gear through the app not change.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:02.000
Fifth Dream asked can we get this update for Final Fantasy 15 Comrades 2 please.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
That's one of those things I need to go back and visit.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
I still need the playthrough 15.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:07.000
Oh you should.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
It's worth playing through.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:13.000
I know it's just I'll do it one of these days.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:20.000
Maybe like a whole maybe 2018 I just buy no games and just play through like 500 games I have in my backlog.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:24.000
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says Nintendo definitely figured out loot boxes.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:27.000
What happened at the end of every stage in Super Mario Brothers 3.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:32.000
Yeah but if you would run and get your P meter full and jump at a 45 degree angle you could hack those loot boxes.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.000
You always get a star.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
That's what the toad houses were for though.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:36.000
That's true.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:37.000
You could hack that game too though.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.000
Yeah I remember that too.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:41.000
Wasn't it based on where like the Hammer Brothers was or something like that.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:46.000
There's a certain place on the screen that you look and every time you push the button in that position and that's where it'll stop.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:48.000
Anyway.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:53.000
So yeah you can hack the shit out of that stuff because it's not online.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
I say hack but it's not really hacking.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:59.000
That's just getting good as they say.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:05.000
Alright hey one of the games that I really liked and I don't remember if this game had loot boxes.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:06.000
I guess it kind of did.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:07.000
It had a loot wheel.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.000
But I don't remember buying spins on the loot wheel.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:11.000
Maybe that was something you could do.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
I don't know but it's Forza Horizon is what I'm talking about.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:17.000
And Forza Horizon is by a developer called Playground Games.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:24.000
And what happened is that they actually announced back in February that they are making a non-racing game.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:25.000
Gasp.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:28.000
Which sadly does that mean we're not getting Forza Horizon 4?

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
Or did that get passed to a different developer?

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
Or is there two teams now there?

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:33.000
I don't know.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:34.000
We don't know about that.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:35.000
But anyway.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:40.000
All we know about this non-racing game is it's an open world game.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:44.000
But they are apparently working based on new reports.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
It's an open world action RPG.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:54.000
They have hired talent from Metal Gear Solid, Hellblade, Suna's Sacrifice, and GTA 5.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:58.000
This all comes in a report from gameindustry.biz.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:04.000
And they obtained the new details on this studio that they're forming to work on the RPG.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:11.000
So Playground brought Sean Istone, Will Kennedy, and Juan Fernandez de Simon on the project.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:14.000
And they are all from those different teams I named a little bit ago.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:19.000
So they said, we're delighted we've secured a second studio to house our new team.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:20.000
Oh, there's the answer.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:24.000
This is a hugely exciting project that is already attracting world class talent to Playground.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:29.000
The combination of New Blood and experienced Playground team members is already showing huge promise.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:34.000
And I'm excited to see this talented group contribute to Playground's continued success.

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
That is all from CEO Gavin Rayburn.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:37.000
So there you go.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:38.000
Awesome.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:42.000
Yeah, I'm really excited to see what they come up with then.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:43.000
And that's good.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:46.000
That means that Forza Horizon 4 really could still happen.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
And it could just all be the Hot Wheels thing.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:51.000
It'll be on...

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:55.000
What was that game that Atari did back in the game with the loop?

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
Hard Drivin'? Was that the game?

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:58.000
Yeah.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:26:59.000
Yeah, it's just...

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
Forza Horizon just needs to go full on hard driving.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:02.000
Oh, the nap machine.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:04.000
What, the what?

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:05.000
Hard Drivin', the nap machine.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:08.000
Oh yeah, the cabinet was so big you could get in there and take a nap.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:09.000
I used to.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:10.000
At work.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:11.000
It's like the old Test Drive games.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:12.000
Yeah, yeah, right.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:13.000
The old Test Drive games.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:14.000
They were like...

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:15.000
I do.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
The graphics were as shitty as the hard driving.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
Dungeon Busters Suggest in chat.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:23.000
Kingdoms of Forza, The Reckoning, minus Curt Schilling.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:24.000
Let's hope so.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
I don't think that guy's ever gonna make it...

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
I want a racing game that's set in the medieval times.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
Or you just fight with...

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:33.000
It's an action RPG featuring just real racing cars.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:35.000
You just...

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.000
I don't know.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:39.000
Alright, let's take a trip down memory lane.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
The classic game of the week.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
Back in the day when...

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:44.000
You didn't have your...

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:48.000
Your studios were limited to three cartridges in a calendar year.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:52.000
And if you were gonna make more games than that, you just had to open up a second wing.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
Hello Ultra Games, Tommy.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:55.000
See what you're doing there?

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
It's a classic game of the week.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
You know that was a thing, right?

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
That because the Atari 2600 went...

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Because there were just garbage games coming out for it.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:10.000
But if you wanted your games to come out on Nintendo, Nintendo limited you to three games a year.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:11.000
Ten games a year.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:15.000
But that's when somebody reversed it to your cartridge.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:16.000
I'm sorry, I'm not telling you.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
What's the other one in another Konami studio that was...

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:19.000
It was Ultra.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:20.000
Ultra, that's right.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:23.000
Ultra put out the Ninja Turtles game in Metal Gear, didn't they?

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:24.000
Yeah.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:25.000
Metal Gear Stakes Adventures.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
Anyway, the classic game of the week.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:30.000
This particular selection was after all that though, actually, right?

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:31.000
Yes.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Whale, whale, after that.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:36.000
This is actually one of those it just turned 10 picks, right?

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:37.000
Yes, it did.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:41.000
Super Mario Galaxy came out in 2007.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:45.000
It came out for the Wii.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:48.000
Remember how much shit we gave them for the Wii?

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
Let's suppose that you're writing a really...

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
I thought I got rid of ads on...

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
Oh, I switched my browser, that's why.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:55.000
Girl.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.000
Sorry about that, guys.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:05.000
Anyway, it also was released in 2011 as a Nintendo Selects title and downloadable via

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:08.000
the Wii U's eShop in 2015.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:14.000
Mario has to go rescue Princess Peach while saving the universe from Bowser this time.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:18.000
Because, like, bitch ain't got other things to do.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:23.000
So basically the galaxies were all like little planets.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:30.000
And you had different variations of gravity, different things that could go on, you'd have

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:33.000
different platforms to move around.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:39.000
And basically it took concepts that came from Super Mario 128, which was a tech demonstration

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:43.000
from Nintendo Space World in 2000.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:48.000
The development began just after that tech demo came out.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:57.000
And it was actually after the release of Donkey Kong Jungle Beat in 2004 is when that came up.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:03.000
And it was actually a suggestion by Miyamoto himself that Nintendo should commission another

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
large-scale Mario game.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:08.000
And so it was...

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:09.000
There you go.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:16.000
It also was one of the first Mario games that had a symphony orchestra with music composed

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:22.000
by Koji Kondo and Mahito Yokota.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:25.000
Sorry, not Yokota, that's the wrong word.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:31.000
Anyway, it was really considered to be one of the best games of its era.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
I mean, even today.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:36.000
It won game of the year across many boards.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:42.000
And it was the first Nintendo title to win the British Academy games award for best games.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
So there you go.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:48.000
It is the ninth best-selling Wii game worldwide.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:53.000
And the best-selling 3D Mario, Super Mario entry.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:57.000
And of course it had a sequel, Super Mario Galaxy 2.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:00.000
It came out for the Wii in 2010.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:09.000
So you would use it, you know, you played it as many games did with the Wiimote and the Nunchuck.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:12.000
Mario's abilities came from Super Mario 64.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:16.000
So he had all of his fun jumps in the somersaults.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:21.000
And he had the star pointer that would show you...

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:29.000
It would show up when you pointed the Wiimote at the screen so that you could find different star bits

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
that looked like a Conpetto.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:34.000
So it was really, really just a neat little game.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
You got your power-ups.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:40.000
You have the spring suit and the boo suit and the bee suit.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:46.000
And your health meter was a three-piece health meter.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:50.000
Just the usual stuff that you expect in a Mario game.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:57.000
You could get your 50 coins without losing a life or 50 star bits or 1-up mushroom to get you extra lives.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:03.000
And then you had co-star mode where one person controls Mario

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:08.000
and the other one basically has a second star pointer that you can shoot at enemies with.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:12.000
So it was really well received overall.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:18.000
The game was a novel concept for when it came out too, just with it using gravity the way it was.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:21.000
And it was really considered just a fun game.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:24.000
The music was fantastic.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:30.000
Like I said, it was orchestral with a 50 person symphony orchestra.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:33.000
And it fit the game quite well.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
It sold great.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:39.000
And it has the sixth highest rating on Metacritic.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:43.000
It was a 97 out of 100 based on 73 reviews at the time.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:50.000
So even while Famitsu doesn't really give out perfect scores that much,

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
they gave them a 38 out of 40.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:56.000
So they got really, really fantastic ratings.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
And so there we go.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
It is a pretty fucking great Mario game.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:01.000
Yeah.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:04.000
And so that's the game, Super Mario Galaxy.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
I kinda can't believe it's 10 years old.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
Thwomp, thwomp.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
Thwomp, thwomp.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:11.000
Thwomp, thwomp.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:12.000
Blarg, blarg.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:17.000
All right, there it is, your classic game of the week for the Wii, Super Mario Galaxy,

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:23.000
which the chat room, by the way, did catch and called out your Freudian slip earlier in the show.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:26.000
Oh, that's why she said Mario Galaxy at the beginning of the show.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:32.000
That actually wasn't why I said it, but I had been listening to the music before coming up here.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
And now we're going to open the maple cookies.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:35.000
All right.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:36.000
Yay, cookies.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:37.000
That means we're going to take a break.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:38.000
Have Hokkaido Momiji cookies.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:39.000
Sure.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
Just make sure Mr. Smoosh doesn't try to eat them all.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:42.000
All right.

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
His ears perked when I said that.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
That cat is going to ruin this show.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:47.000
We're going to take a quick break.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:48.000
We're going to come back, though.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:52.000
There's much more show to come, including another Iwata tribute.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:53.000
I think it's really cute.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:54.000
We're going to get to in rapid fire news.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:34:00.000
We're also going to talk about what's going on in Pokemon Go, besides me spending money, and theme parks,

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:04.000
when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:13.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:21.000
Live tonight, episode number 708 for this November the 26th of 2017, enjoying those last few minutes of the long weekend.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:28.000
For those of you that got a long weekend, I know some of you brave souls work in retail and other industries that have you working over the weekend.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:31.000
Even I worked on Friday, which is weird.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:34.000
I have the type of office job that usually isn't there on Black Friday.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:42.000
But we were there, so I didn't get a full weekend, but I had a nice restful Saturday and Sunday after the fact.

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:45.000
So I hope you guys had a nice restful weekend as well.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:52.000
During the break, I know we can't play these on the podcast because, you know, we can't distribute someone else's songs and all that stuff.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:56.000
But we did play a song randomly from Soul Calibur during the music break tonight.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:01.000
And some folks in chat, Vid Power, said, I hope they make another Soul Calibur game again.

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
And Fifth Dream says, yes, we need Soul Calibur badly.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:09.000
Well, it didn't make the show roll tonight because we addressed it a little bit last week.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:13.000
There are heavy rumors picking up about Soul Calibur 6.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:20.000
But now, I feel like Namco Bandai, because of that rumor, started putting out conflicting rumors this week.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:28.000
Meaning, like, now we're hearing, oh, it's not being unveiled at PSX, it's being unveiled at the Video Game Awards.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:34.000
And, oh, the bonus character on Nintendo is not Link, it's one of the Fire Emblem characters instead.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:37.000
So, there's a lot of, like, noise out there on that front.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:40.000
But it does sound like one way or another, Soul Calibur 6 is going to happen.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:44.000
Which makes sense. I mean, those Soul Calibur games have always sold pretty well, haven't they?

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:49.000
It's been a while. Soul Calibur 5 was a PlayStation 3 exclusive, if I'm right, right?

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
Did they put that anywhere else? I think.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:56.000
I know 4 was on Xbox 360 because 4 had Yoda, Invader, and all that stuff, right?

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
Yoda. Yoda.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:02.000
But 5 was only on PlayStation 3, if I remember right.

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:06.000
So, it'll be interesting to see what they do with 6. It does seem like it should be time for that.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:11.000
Fifth Dream in Chat says, Soul Calibur 6 should be insanely beautiful on PlayStation 4 Pro.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:17.000
Bob Coffee says, Soul Calibur 6 probably won't happen until Tekken 7 is done, I imagine.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
Eh, there could be different teams. Who knows?

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:23.000
JD says 5 was also on 360. Okay, I must've missed that.

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:28.000
4 was the one that had Yoda, Invader, right? I didn't get that confused.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:34.000
No, okay, I know what it is. Soul Calibur 3 was a PlayStation 2 exclusive, right?

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:38.000
That was when they first spread out, like the hula hoop girl and the...

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:43.000
Yeah, some of those other characters. So, who was the character in Soul Calibur 5?

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
Who was the bonus character they put in that?

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
Was 5 Vader? Or was that 4?

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:52.000
No, that was 4. I don't remember who the bonus characters were.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
Was it Kratos?

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
That sounds right. I think you're right.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
Was it Kratos and then was it Higachi?

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
Ezio. Ezio.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:03.000
That's right. I think Ezio was on both.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:07.000
Yeah, the game's guest character is Ezio from Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
That's what it was.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:10.000
Oh.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:14.000
There it is. And then they're saying Kratos in chat as well.

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
So, there you go. I don't see that in the Wiki article.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:19.000
I thought that was only on, well obviously only on Linzoni.

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
And then...

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
Yeah.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:26.000
No, that was Dead or Alive.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
Never mind.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
Yeah. Yeah, Soul Calibur 5 with Ezio.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:33.000
Okay, it's been a while. I mean, it's been a while since those games were out.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:36.000
So, we're due for Soul Calibur 6. I'm sure it's gonna happen.

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:41.000
Anyway, let's get to some rapid fire news and quickly talk about some other stuff going on in the gaming world. Loki.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:47.000
So, this is just silly, but apparently, you know, Sonic Forces has the whole create your own Sonic character that they have in there.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:51.000
Quickly. Kratos was on the handheld spinoff. That's why we're getting confused.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:54.000
Because there was a Soul Calibur on the handheld. That's where Kratos was.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
I thought he was also on the console.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
That's where we're getting confused. Anyway, go ahead.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:04.000
Anyways, so Sonic Forces, you know, they have the whole thing where you can actually design your own Sonic character to play as in the game.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:13.000
So now, they have an update. I guess it's free DLC where you can get a Sanic t-shirt for your character.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:14.000
That's right, Sanic.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
But can you get a Princess Zordla shirt?

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
Nah, Princess Zordla. I'm sorry.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:19.000
Zordla!

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:20.000
Just the Sanic.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:21.000
Danky Kang.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:24.000
Just the Sanic Hedgehog t-shirt. So, that's kind of funny.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:25.000
What about Patch?

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:30.000
I kind of love how meme-aware the Sonic social media team is.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:31.000
It's pretty great.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
It is pretty funny. At least they can poke fun at themselves.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:38.000
If only they would be aware that we fucking want PSO2. But hey. Or PSO2, excuse me. But hey.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:48.000
And in other Sonic news, apparently there has been a new patch that's been created for Sonic 3D Blast.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:57.000
And this is actually a patch that was developed by, I guess, one of the lead programmers and founders of Traveler's Tales who does the LEGO games now.

01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:04.000
And I guess he was one of the original lead programmers as well of the game.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:07.000
Apparently, yeah, he's in the...

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
What did he do here?

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:20.000
Because Sonic 3D is a part of the Sonic legacy, and Sonic had a mixed legacy, I'd like to address where I can my part in that.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:30.000
If I can make Sonic 3D a bit more acceptable to the Sonic fan base within a few days of my time, then great. Why not try it?

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:37.000
So he has a Sonic 3D Blast, or Sonic 3D Blast DX, the director's cut.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:47.000
I'm not exactly sure what they changed on it to make it better, because I didn't really play a lot of Sonic 3D Blast.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:54.000
Yeah, that game's kind of hard to get into, honestly. But that's, you know, out of the Sonic games.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:40:01.000
So they fixed some of the handling in the game, it looks like. They have a time challenge mode.

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:04.000
They set a better camera.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:09.000
I guess you can save passwords. There's a level editor.

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:13.000
A crab, I guess, was in a prototype thing.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:20.000
Difficulty tweaks, options, pallets, a lot of new stuff. So that's kind of cool.

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:24.000
And I'm not sure where you can get the patch, but I'm sure this is the internet. Google it.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:28.000
Alright, let's talk about some tournament news.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:33.000
Actually, I've got some updates on Genesis 5, which is a tournament not far from here.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:38.000
It's going to be in Oakland this year, at the Oakland Convention Center, running January, I think it's 19th through the 21st.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:44.000
And actually they're saying that the finals, the top 8 finals, will be at the Paramount Theater, which is a real gorgeous concert venue.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:49.000
I saw Bjork there, back in the day. That was on the Vesper Teen Tour, that's how long ago that was.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:55.000
But anyway, so that's pretty cool that the Genesis tournament, and not to be confused with Sega Genesis, sorry.

01:40:55.000 --> 01:41:03.000
It's actually mostly a fighting game tournament, and they announced that Street Fighter 5 is going to be there, but also some older hits.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:08.000
And I think this is really cool, including Super Smash Brothers, the original, as well as Melee and Wii U.

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:13.000
DDR Extreme, they're going to have a contest on. That's pretty rad.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:18.000
Not the newer DDRs, DDR Extreme, the one that we had during that long period.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:22.000
DDR USA, let's go that far back, or fourth next year.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:30.000
So these are all additions for Saturday only, Marvel vs. Capcom, Infinite in there too, Pokken, Tournament DX, Act After You Listening.

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:34.000
All those games are going to be there for Genesis, so that's really awesome.

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:39.000
I noticed Splatoon 2 is going to be one of the games they're doing a tournament on as well, so that'll be fun.

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:44.000
Hey, speaking of tournaments, this one caught my eye, another news for this.

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:52.000
January 27th, also in the Bay Area, namely San Jose at Round 1, there's going to be a DDR tournament.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:55.000
And this is really trying to be like an old school DDR tournament.

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:59.000
They are calling this Freestyle Takeover, is the name of this tournament.

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:04.000
It was just announced, and it was announced of course on 20 November, which was on Monday.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:08.000
And you can get tickets on Eventbrite, although I believe it's going to be free just to go watch.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:13.000
But it is $15 to compete, and I think it is a pure freestyle tournament.

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:17.000
I haven't seen anything for, yeah, and it even says in the about,

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:21.000
a devoted community has kept the game alive through technical feats, score-based feats.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:25.000
Freestyle has laid dominant for years, or dormant, excuse me, dormant for years.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:32.000
And I know a friend of the show who's been on way back in the day, Mel B, this is who's Facebook that I caught it on,

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:37.000
and I wonder if he's going to do a new freestyle routine all these years later.

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:42.000
It sounds like a lot of these guys that were kind of, you know, well known for freestyling back in the old school days of DDR

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:47.000
in the earlier days of the show, might be dusting them shoes off to do some new freestyle routines.

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:51.000
So this would be a lot of fun. Dark Sakura, maybe we should go find some orange bats.

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:54.000
I still have mine.

01:42:54.000 --> 01:43:00.000
Maybe we could enter, I don't know. Anyway, the first thing I said to Mel when I heard about this was,

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:04.000
how can we help here at OLR, because we're still here all these years later.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:10.000
I would love to go just say hello, and you know, even if maybe we can like donate a prize or something, we'll figure something out.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:15.000
I'm sure I have like old VRares and stuff that I was never able to give away back in the day.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:18.000
I could throw into a prize pot or something, so we'll figure that out.

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:23.000
But anyway, I know I'm planning on going. Hopefully my co-host can make a cameo as well.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:26.000
That'll be the end of next month.

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
Moving on, Dark Sakura.

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:44.000
Well, there is more coming out for The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:48.000
Something that's more of a little gift.

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:53.000
But basically, hold on just a second.

01:43:53.000 --> 01:44:00.000
Basically, if you duck down and open a chest, Link will throw out a punching animation.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:07.000
Basically, it's just like a little thing that they've discovered.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:10.000
It was on the Tips from the Wild news channel.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
So it's just a neat thing.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:23.000
And then in other news, Pokemon Ultra Sun and Moon have a tribute to Satoru Iwata.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:38.000
Basically, in this particular one, if you visit the Game Freak building while having a gold or silver Pokemon in your party,

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:43.000
they will say that the developers were helped out by an amazing guy.

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:46.000
So there you go.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:51.000
Yeah, that's a really cute little tribute in the Pokemon games.

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:55.000
I kind of skipped buying them because I never finish Pokemon games.

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:58.000
And I'm waiting for the Switch version at this point.

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
That's kind of where I'm at.

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:03.000
But I've heard some good feedback on Ultra Sun and Moon.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
Maybe I'll change my mind.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
I keep hearing it as ultrasound.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:11.000
Alright, let's travel around the world and check out what games are coming out this week.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:14.000
Although I have a feeling it's going to be really slow, right, Loki?

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:17.000
Yeah, it's definitely slowing down towards the end of the year.

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:22.000
Especially after the first few months of November, it's just dead until March.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:29.000
So we've got, starting off, Resident Evil Revelations and Resident Evil Revelations 2 on the Nintendo Switch.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:33.000
Little Witch Academia, Chamber of Time on PlayStation 4.

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:36.000
Siberia 2 on the Nintendo Switch.

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:41.000
The game, Paradise Cruise and Mix on PC and PlayStation 4.

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:45.000
7, The Days Long Gone on PC.

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:49.000
And finally Xenoblade Chronicles 2 on Nintendo Switch.

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
That's it.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:54.000
Alright, traveling to Japan on November 30th.

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:59.000
Little Witch Academia Toki no Mahoutou Nanafushi comes out.

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
There's a new Nobunaga game this week.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:05.000
Nobunaga no Yabu Taishi comes out on November 30th.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:08.000
As well as Game Paradise Cruise and Mix.

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:11.000
That same game I think Loki just referenced here in the US.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
That is also out in Japan.

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:16.000
Sounds like there's a new Dragon Quest Slime Controller.

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:19.000
Because you can never have enough Dragon Quest Slime Controllers.

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:24.000
On the Vita this week, Uso Suki Shangri-La comes out in a regular and limited edition.

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:28.000
As well as Gakuen Club Himitsu no Night Club.

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
That's like school club something.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
It's always school games, isn't it?

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
On the Nintendo Switch, guess what?

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:39.000
Nobunaga no Yabu also on the Switch in regular and treasure box editions.

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:42.000
So I'm assuming this is the first Nobunaga game on Switch.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:43.000
So that's pretty cool.

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:46.000
Biohazard Revelations, which of course means Resident Evil.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
The collection and the unveiled edition.

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
Also out in Japan this week.

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:56.000
And a whole bunch of different accessories and pouches if you are looking to carry your Nintendo Switch in a hip new way.

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:59.000
One more game worth mentioning on the Nintendo 3DS.

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
Act F, are you listening up?

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:06.000
Kirby Battle Deluxe is out this week on November 30th on the 3DS.

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:12.000
And if you've been holding off on it, Monster Hunter XX gets a price reduction this week.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:16.000
And maybe Dark Sakura would be interested in the Dragon Ball Extreme Fusion Pack.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:19.000
Alright, how about the UK Dark Sakura?

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:22.000
Just a couple of things on the 28th.

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:28.000
Black Mirror for Playstation 4 and Xbox One and Game Dev Tycoon for iPad and iPhone.

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:31.000
Black Mirror like the show?

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:34.000
Because that would be pretty awesome if there's a game based on the show.

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:39.000
Yeah, I was actually seeing that on the release chart I was looking at here.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:42.000
I know they have a new season coming out. I saw the trailer for that.

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:43.000
They do.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:46.000
Is there something about a reboot of the game?

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:52.000
Gothic Point and Click Adventure Black Mirror is getting a reboot by THQ Nordic.

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
Oh, well that's not unfortunately what I'm looking at.

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:57.000
No, it is not related to the TV show.

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
That is kind of interesting though that they have...

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
That looks kind of neat though.

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:04.000
I'm curious to see what that looks like in motion. It kind of looks like the seventh guest to me.

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
And some of those things.

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
Alright, sorry I guess Chat Room is yelling at me.

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:13.000
It's Monster Hunter Double Cross which shows you how long ago I kind of...

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
I tried to get it to the one on Wii U.

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
That shows you how little Rob cares.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
Well, I don't want to say that because some people are into it.

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
It's just Monster Hunter Kiss Kiss. That's all it is.

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:25.000
Kiss Kiss. Monster Hunter Kiss Kiss. I like that better.

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:28.000
Alright, let's get to the mailbag.

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:31.000
You guys email us and we try to respond.

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:32.000
Try.

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:36.000
Unless we forget, which I guess is the case with one of our emails this week.

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
Participate at OrangeOnTrader.com.

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
This is the place to send your emails.

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
Let's get to it.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:43.000
Okay.

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:46.000
Hey, OLR crew, AZHP here.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
I'm a bit behind on your podcast.

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:52.000
Due to just recently getting married and being in Japan on my honeymoon, Mazel Tov.

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:53.000
Congrats.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:59.000
And I wanted to chime in about a story you had on October 23rd about IGN acquiring Humble Bundle.

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:07.000
You all, like many other people, are under the continued assumption that Humble Bundle is still only a bundle portal which has sliders for charity.

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:10.000
I am not under that impression. You are wrong.

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
Because I know they have a store portal.

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:15.000
I'm just not good at the impression that IGN's evil. That's all.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:21.000
I think it's been a while. And this was, to be fair to the emailer, this is the one that we forgot to read when it first came in.

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
And I don't know how we skipped it. So sorry about that.

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:26.000
But I'm trying to remember where we were at.

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:29.000
But yeah, I know they have a storefront because that's one of the things.

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:32.000
I've known this for a while. I've bought games to them before.

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:37.000
But to be fair, I think most people know it from the bundles.

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
Like, you know, at least that's kind of where it started.

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:40.000
Yeah, but way to assume.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
Yeah, well, I don't know. I have to go back and listen to the episode.

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:45.000
It's very possible we were focusing on that element of it.

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:55.000
Anyway, the truth is Humble Bundle has for some time been a straight up video game storefront similar to Steam and Origin.

01:49:55.000 --> 01:50:02.000
IGN is likely buying them because they see future in the storefront and the publishing arm, not in the charity bundle aspect.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:12.000
Loki also mentioned that there were potential conflicts of interest arising from Humble Bundle published games being reviewed by IGN as a publication.

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:19.000
While this is a valid concern, as a former employee I will be the first to say that IGN had scummy business practices as all hell.

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:26.000
The editors took their job seriously and didn't let publishers and marketing teams strong arm them in deducing review scores for the sake of the deal.

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:32.000
It's been five or so years since I've been there. They could certainly have changed, but I don't see a cause for concern there.

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:38.000
I know I made it. Loki's like, was that the cat? No, that was me making a nervous noise because I don't.

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:44.000
OK, no, I appreciate the honest insight. I just.

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:47.000
It's very blunt feedback, that's all I'm saying.

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:53.000
Nobody said that while they had scummy practices, their editing was serious.

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
OK, and they they gave fair reviews.

01:50:55.000 --> 01:51:02.000
That's fair. So I also found it funny that Loki said it would be like if Fox News bought Humble Bundle and that'd be pretty sketchy.

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:07.000
I don't know if you all were aware, but Fox News did in fact own IGN for a significant period of time.

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:11.000
Yes, I'm well aware of that. And Rupert Murdoch was totally signing our paychecks.

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:14.000
Yes, I'm well aware of that. Wow, I forgot.

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:19.000
However, this influence only extended as far as the upper management treating employees mercilessly.

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:28.000
Working passionate people, thankless, long hours and canning them when they were no longer needed and never manifesting as any sort of spin that was required for articles and reviews.

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:36.000
You know, I hate to say it because this is going to sound really just like like I don't care, unempathetic.

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:40.000
But like, isn't that the like entirety of the game industry?

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:48.000
Not I'm not saying it's right, but I'm just saying, like, unfortunately, I hear this about a lot of places.

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:54.000
I guess it really comes down to where do people feel valued and where do they not?

01:51:54.000 --> 01:52:05.000
Most of the editors I was friends with were free thinking, free spirited people through and through and would certainly not have been there if they were forced to spend things in the way that Fox News was.

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:12.000
Anyway, that was a bit of a ramble and I apologize, but those are my two cents on a Humble Bundle acquisition.

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:18.000
As someone who used to work for IGN and has a somewhat jaded view on the matter, yours truly AZHP.

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:24.000
Well, I'm sorry that we missed your email, but we didn't miss the second version.

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:28.000
Thank you for that very blunt and candid feedback.

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
I like blunt.

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
No, I mean, don't get me wrong. I like it.

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
I just, you know.

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:38.000
I don't censor anything unless you say something shitty.

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
And that's like actually.

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:46.000
Or if the person says don't read this on air, we usually are not going to do that.

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:47.000
Well, you know.

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:51.000
So we have another email that came through the site.

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:55.000
I've been listening for the last few years. I've enjoyed the show during my commute.

01:52:55.000 --> 01:53:00.000
Thanks for the great show. I was wondering if there's a game you've been given crap for liking.

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:08.000
I was recently playing games with my friends the other day and they were roasting me for being a fan of the Kingdom Hearts games because of this cringe worthy writing.

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:11.000
Has this happened to you before? This is signed by Chris.

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:17.000
I generally like awesome games, so no.

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:20.000
I mean, most of us, we all kind of like a lot of the same stuff.

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:24.000
Let me give you an example. Are there any MMOs you've been playing recently, Jamie?

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:25.000
Girl.

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
No. Are there any MMOs you've been playing recently?

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:28.000
No, actually.

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:29.000
Really? Nothing?

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:33.000
Because I haven't re-upped on the two and I'm not playing Ragnarok online.

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:34.000
Addict.

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:37.000
I haven't touched it.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:42.000
I was trying to set her up for an addict joke, but then she had to dodge all over that question.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
Well, because I really wasn't playing anything.

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
I know, but that's usually us giving each other shit.

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:49.000
Wouldn't it be great if we had an Animal Crossing MMO for reals?

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
That's what they could do on the Switch.

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
They could, but are they? No.

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:54.000
No, I'm not going to hold my breath.

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:55.000
Bitches.

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:56.000
An MMO on a Nintendo platform.

01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:01.000
Hey, it will be fucking noteworthy if it ever does happen. Just saying.

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
We'll give it ten years.

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:09.000
Oh, yeah. Thank you, Bobby. I should have just got her to talk about Mass Effect.

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
Then I could have said Addict.

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:12.000
Mass Effect is free.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
How many followers does your Tumblr have now?

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:15.000
1,100.

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:16.000
Addict.

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:19.000
No, no, no, serious. No, that's not me being added.

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:22.000
That's people being addicted to my product.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:26.000
I'm going to get Mr...

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:27.000
They have the demand.

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000
Eight plus quality alien penis.

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:34.000
I have to get more followers for Mr. Smoosh on Instagram.

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:35.000
I'm just kidding.

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
Mr. Smoosh will smoosh the competition.

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
All you have to do is be as witty as I am.

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:41.000
I don't know if I can do that.

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:45.000
So, games that we get shit for liking.

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:50.000
Probably my cell phone stuff, like Ingress and Pokemon Go.

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:51.000
I definitely...

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:52.000
What was that one game...

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
I've been given shit for both of those.

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
That we were building the apartments in?

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:58.000
Tiny Tower?

01:54:58.000 --> 01:54:59.000
Tiny Tower.

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:00.000
Oh, yeah.

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:01.000
That one for a bit.

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:02.000
That came up last week.

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
Did that come up on the show last week?

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
I was just talking about that game like a week ago.

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:07.000
Maybe.

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:08.000
Anyway.

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
There's been other games I'm sure we have...

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
Dance Sense Revolution.

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:13.000
Oh, yeah.

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:14.000
That might be one too.

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:18.000
People did kind of give us shit for President Cat even though we never actually played it

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:19.000
unless we were Loki.

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:23.000
Remember that totally fucking passive aggressive article some website wrote about the whole

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:29.000
President Cat campaign about like, well, internet campaigns don't usually translate into good

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:30.000
business sense.

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:31.000
And look at the President now.

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000
Wouldn't you rather have a cat as the President?

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:34.000
I mean, come on.

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:39.000
A cat taking a shit would do a better job than the garbage we have now.

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:47.000
Mr. Smoosh, please sneeze so that you can do a better job than number 45.

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:49.000
Alright, anyway.

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:52.000
Thank you, President Smoosh.

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:54.000
That's the sequel.

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
President Cat followed by President Smoosh.

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:57.000
Loki, what about you?

01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:01.000
Surely there's nothing you play that people give you shit for playing.

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
That your wife has ever given you shit for playing.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:04.000
That's like everything.

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:08.000
There's nothing that my wife doesn't give me shit about enough.

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:11.000
We give Loki shit for never finishing his own game.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:12.000
That's true.

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:13.000
And I haven't really worked on game development.

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
I've been thinking about working on game development.

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:19.000
That's been my conflict, but I just haven't done that.

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:23.000
I don't know.

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:27.000
I guess one game I like that not a lot of people like would be Earth Defense Force.

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:28.000
I like those games.

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:32.000
I mean, if you objectively look at them, they're kind of crap.

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
I don't know.

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:39.000
But people don't really give me crap about playing games.

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:42.000
I don't know.

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
Who would do that?

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:48.000
I just get crap for not making my own game.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:49.000
Which, yeah, that's fair enough.

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000
I have a legit answer for this.

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:52.000
A game that I get shit for liking.

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:57.000
Because everybody wants to shit on this game and call it one of the worst 8-bit games that they ever made.

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000
I don't think this game is as bad as people say it is.

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
Friday the 13th.

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000
I don't think it was a great game.

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:04.000
It wasn't great.

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:08.000
But I remember it was certainly one of the first games I remember having legit jump scares at.

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:11.000
When you're in that fucking house and you turn a corner and then

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:12.000
Bong, bong, bong, bong.

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:15.000
And fluorescent Jason, is there a way to cut a bitch?

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
That shit was scary.

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:20.000
I gave my friend Julie shit for liking Mylon's Secret Castle.

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:24.000
I fucking owned Mylon's Secret Castle. You apologized to Julie.

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:28.000
Well, no, it's just because I didn't like that there was no way to continue.

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:34.000
But I would have games that I would just sit and leave my Nintendo on all night and pray I didn't set the house on fire.

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:37.000
That's how you had to do it back in the day.

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:40.000
I used to do it too so my mom couldn't see it was on.

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:43.000
I would have a blanket over the Nintendo or something.

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:46.000
Because that'll make it less hot.

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:50.000
Yeah, but like when you're like nine, you're not critical.

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
I'd just prop up a cartridge in front of it.

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
Or a cutout of a box.

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
I don't remember those NES's getting that hot.

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:59.000
I remember it was at the pocket station.

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:00.000
You know, it had limited battery life.

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:05.000
But I think if you plugged it into your Playstation or whatever, it would still play itself.

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:08.000
And so I'd leave that in there overnight for days.

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
And then come back and have all these items.

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
People would give me shit about the money I would spend on games.

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
Thank you, Doomplague.

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
That game is underappreciated.

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:20.000
I mean, it's not a good game, but it was ahead of its time in some ways.

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:21.000
And Dark Tetsuya says,

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
Rygar, I tried to beat that in one sitting.

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:27.000
I remember staying up late with my uncle trying to get to the end in one go.

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:28.000
It always blew me away.

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:31.000
Like, how fucking different the NES Rygar and the arcade Rygar are.

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
They are like two completely different games.

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000
It's like Strider.

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
Well, but you know Strider is based off of the manga.

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000
One's the manga, one's the arcade.

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:40.000
Yeah.

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:45.000
But I think the biggest shit people would give me was for the money I spent on them.

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:49.000
The very first import game I ever bought, I paid $110 for.

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:52.000
And that was to get the Sailor Moon S fighting game.

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:59.000
That I learned how to mod my game genie so that I could do the chibi moon butt attack.

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:05.000
I'm gonna wait for the emails this week giving me shit about how much I confessed to spending on Pokemon Go this week.

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
Girl.

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:13.000
I spent $90 on the Rival Schools Evolution release that came out.

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000
You remember that one?

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:16.000
I don't.

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:17.000
It had like the school life dating sim.

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:20.000
I just remember the Dreamcast game you owned with the fucking dish.

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:21.000
That blows me away.

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:22.000
Okay.

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:23.000
You bought a game with a dish.

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:24.000
And it wasn't even that great.

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:29.000
It was the Cardcaptor Sakura game and I thought it was gonna be like Pokemon Snap with Cardcaptor Sakura.

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:32.000
And it kind of was but it sucked.

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:36.000
Cuz you, oh crap, why can't I remember her name?

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:37.000
Her little friend.

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000
The cute little girl that makes all of her costumes.

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.000
You're asking the wrong person.

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:42.000
Ugh.

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:43.000
I can't remember.

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:44.000
More of a Ranma question I would think.

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:48.000
S2100 Matt in chat says, uh, Dr. Seuss is Kuro?

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:49.000
No, not Kero-chan.

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:52.000
S2100 Matt says, I think people got a ton of shit for playing Runescape.

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:53.000
Tomoyo.

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:54.000
Back in the day.

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:55.000
Tomoyo.

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
Do you know how many people get shit for playing WoW?

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:58.000
Anyway.

01:59:58.000 --> 01:59:59.000
I played Gemstone.

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:00.000
Gemstone 3.

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:01.000
But anyway.

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:04.000
Why don't you stop giving everybody shit and learn from your friends?

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:05.000
We have another email.

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:06.000
Oh, okay.

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:09.000
Um, this comes from Robert M.

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
Just seeing how you're doing.

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:15.000
I was taken by surprise Tuesday morning when Animal Crossing Pocket Camp launched.

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:20.000
I'm having frequent connection issues which are hopefully server side.

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:21.000
Launch window jitters.

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:22.000
Certainly having fun with it.

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
And yes, that should have been resolved by now.

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
I haven't had any disconnects.

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
Oh yeah, we actually, we never got around to it.

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:32.000
We never got around to it, but it was, uh, the link in the kickoff story was about those issues.

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:38.000
Nintendo did apologize for it and they changed the timing of some things and gave everybody 20 leaf tickets.

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:39.000
How about that?

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:42.000
Alright.

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
Woo! 20 tickets!

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
That'll buy you an extra storage slot.

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
Can you give us our virtual console?

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:54.000
Also, I see the Transformer site I follow has news on an upcoming crossover with Street Fighter.

02:00:54.000 --> 02:01:00.000
Yes, these are exciting figure, uh, existing figures redecode as characters from the game.

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:06.000
A deluxe-sized two-pack of Generations RC is Chun-Li with Titan's return Hot Rod as Ken.

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:15.000
Then a Voyager set of, uh, TR Optimus Prime slash Convoy as Ryu versus, uh, TR Megatron as M. Bison's Las Vegas.

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:19.000
These are, from what I gathered, limited edition Japanese releases from Takara Tomy.

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:24.000
I looked at the Chun-Li and I'm like, shit, why didn't I buy an RC?

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:30.000
The only thing that I would really want would be another Hot Rod to add to my collection of 50 million other Hot Rods.

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:35.000
I think I have, like, three Rodimus Primes and seven Hot Rods from various collections.

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000
So, it'd have to go to my collection.

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.000
And Dan would be like, oh, it's Ken, that's cool.

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:47.000
Um, P.S. I do sometimes pronounce the merch company as Ta-Takerotemi.

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:50.000
Okay, but Takara Tomy, anyway.

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:55.000
Um, like a surgical procedure, but only in jest.

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:58.000
We say silly things sometimes, like, don't we always call Squarey-

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:04.000
Oh, he's saying Ta-ka-rota-me, like it would be a surgical pr- that's funny, huh.

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:05.000
Takara-ta-me.

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:06.000
Takara-ta-me.

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:07.000
I don't know.

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:08.000
Ta-pa-ra-ma-nee. I don't know.

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:16.000
Um, I- I've probably spent a lot of money at HobbyLink Japan when I was in the height of my-

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:19.000
I need every single Hot Rod figure that's- I've got, like, a Canadian one, Ab-Japanese one-

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:22.000
Responsible income is awesome. I don't need to save.

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:26.000
Well, this- actually, I bought- my Hot Rod collection comes from spite.

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:37.000
Because, when I was a kid, my mother, and she'll deny it to this day, she's like, girls don't play with Transformers, I'll get you another Barbie.

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:42.000
Mother, I need to see Optimus Prime die, you don't understand.

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:45.000
You don't need to go see that boys movie.

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000
So I snuck to go see it anyway.

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:48.000
Of course you did.

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:49.000
And I sobbed.

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:52.000
And then I was like, fucking A, Hot Rod's cool.

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:59.000
And that also kind of started my obsession with, um, uh, what's this fuck?

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:02.000
Great, now I can see him in the Breakfast Club and I can't think of his name.

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:03.000
Emilio Estevez?

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:04.000
No, not Emilio Estevez.

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:05.000
Judd Nelson?

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:06.000
Judd Nelson.

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:07.000
Judd Nelson was Hot Rod's voice.

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:13.000
Also, Orson- that was Orson Welles' last role was Unicron in that movie.

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:14.000
Leonard Nimoy-

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:17.000
I'm sorry, but that is just the quintessential Jamie growing up story.

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:18.000
Leonard Nimoy was in that too.

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:19.000
Yes, I did.

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:20.000
As Galvatron.

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:21.000
Yes.

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:22.000
But anyway, yes.

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:27.000
So I, as an adult, I had a whole shitload of Transformers and a bunch of Hot Rods.

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:32.000
I have, like, a couple of Starscreams and we have all the Binaltech- a lot of the Binaltech ones.

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:38.000
All my stuff- now, see, I was not, you know, don't bring your stereotypes into this because

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
I was not into Barbies or any of that stuff.

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:45.000
I was always into the very, like, Lego- I'm into all the stuff that Loki's into now.

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000
That was the stuff I was into when I was a kid.

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.000
Legos, especially.

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.000
Uh, constructs.

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:54.000
Tinkertoys were the shit.

02:03:54.000 --> 02:04:00.000
My grandma had- I don't know if you ever saw these, but she had Tinkertoys that were, like,

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:01.000
adult-sized Tinkertoys.

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:02.000
Oh, shit.

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:03.000
That's cool!

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:08.000
Like, they had, like, the largest polar they had was, like, a good four or five feet long.

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:13.000
And, like, the plast- like, the actual piece- the little round wood things that you plug

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:19.000
them into were, like, the size of, I don't know, like, a small wheelbarrow tire or something like that.

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:20.000
Oh, that's cool.

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
It was, like, we used to build, like, Fords out of that shit.

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:27.000
Or just use the large green pieces as, like, bow staffs because we pretended that it shows.

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:28.000
Do they still make Tinkertoys?

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:29.000
Or is that-

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:30.000
They have-

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:31.000
It's probably cheap-ass-

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:32.000
It's all plastic.

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:33.000
Fuck-ass plastic.

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:34.000
It's plastic shit.

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:35.000
No, no, no, no.

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000
Tinkertoys are made of wood.

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:41.000
But, when I was a kid, though, I also really super-loved Lincoln Logs.

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:47.000
And I would combine my Lincoln Logs and Tinkertoys to make, like, this elaborate death trap for

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000
all my Barbies.

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000
I'll show you playing with Barbies.

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:54.000
Do you wanna play a game?

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:58.000
And no one- and no one could come in my room because these labyrinths would spawn-

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:01.000
The minute the door opened, an elaborate death trap would behead Barbie.

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:02.000
Up on the bed.

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:07.000
And, finally, I think just, like, they got, you know, broken and thrown away because I

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:10.000
kept, you know, making it unsafe to navigate my bedroom.

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:14.000
But my all-time favorite was Domino Rally.

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
Yes, yes, yes.

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:17.000
They sell that now.

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:18.000
They do.

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
Dirt is dirt fucking cheap.

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:21.000
I almost bought it.

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:24.000
And I was like, Rob, you don't have kids.

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:25.000
You know what else is-

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:26.000
Who cares?

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:27.000
Who cares?

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:28.000
What else is also cheap?

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:33.000
Like, I remember, like, back when I had, like, uh, K'Nex or whatever, and I only really had

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:37.000
one set of that, but, like, I remember the K'Nex roller coasters were, like, so fucking,

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:38.000
like, expensive and elaborate.

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
Now they're so cheap.

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:43.000
And Mouse Trap was the best board game ever.

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:44.000
Yeah, that was pretty fun.

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:45.000
Yeah.

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:46.000
Anyway.

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:47.000
Alright.

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:48.000
Uh.

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:49.000
That's it for emails.

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:50.000
That's it for emails.

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
Boy, did we get on some tangents with those emails tonight.

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:53.000
Okay.

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:57.000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you wanna send this show into a Barbie death trap

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:58.000
spiral.

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
In the meantime-

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:03.000
I was just an imaginative, creative child.

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:04.000
Yes you were.

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:05.000
Yes you were.

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:08.000
Alright, let's get into some other gaming news.

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:11.000
Speaking of robots, right, Loki?

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:12.000
Yes.

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:18.000
Ironically enough, I am looking at a picture of a robot, but, um, not anything to do with

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:19.000
this article.

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:23.000
So, um, Valve is changing the way their review system works.

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:29.000
The stop from, um, having bots basically manipulate that system.

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:35.000
So, they've, I guess, having a problem with, I guess, um, bot brigade- bot brigading on

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.000
certain games.

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:41.000
And, um, including, I guess, anti-review bomb charts and stuff like that that they've added,

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000
um, in recent updates.

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:47.000
But now they're kind of trying to do some additional stuff with that.

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:51.000
First, of course, they've acknowledged saying that, you know, basically that there's a small

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:58.000
group to manipulate reviews to a degree that is clearly decreasing the value of Steam for

02:06:58.000 --> 02:06:59.000
many other players.

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000
And to solve this problem, they're doing a couple things.

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:06.000
First, the helpful ratings from the accounts, um, that are far outside the norm will be

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:10.000
weighed differently than those of regular, presumably human users.

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:16.000
Accounts that rate an excessive number of reviews on games will see the weight of each

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:20.000
review rating count for less and less.

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:26.000
Um, that's kind of lame if they- if there's someone that's actually reviewing games.

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:31.000
I would think that- can you review games that you don't buy on Steam?

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:35.000
I think you used to be able to, but not anymore.

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:41.000
If you're gifted the code, then it actually puts a disclaimer by your little review that says

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:44.000
a code was provided by the publisher or something like that.

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000
So that whole like disclaimer is up front.

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:50.000
I don't believe you can review a game that you haven't played because it also shows right

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:53.000
underneath it how many hours you've put into the game.

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:54.000
True.

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:55.000
Let me ask this question.

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:58.000
I just want to ask this general question of our chat room.

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:05.000
Have you ever been influenced on buying a video game or not based on like user reviews

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:06.000
on Steam?

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:07.000
Have you really?

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:11.000
Well, yeah, because like, especially like if I'm looking to purchase a game and I see

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:14.000
a bunch of negative reviews for it and I start reading them and it's like, oh yeah,

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:19.000
the DRM is causing issues of the game or blah, blah, blah is causing issues of the game.

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:27.000
Like for example, South Park, you know, of this fractured butthole on PC is kind of broken,

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:30.000
I think, unless they've patched that recently.

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:34.000
But it came out kind of broken because of the DRM in there and is buggy.

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:37.000
And so that's one of the reasons I guess I didn't purchase it on Steam.

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:42.000
But it's good to know those kind of things are like, you know, other issues where, you

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:46.000
know, the performance might not be as good or especially games I'm not familiar with

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000
and I may see something like, oh, that looks really cool.

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:53.000
And I read the reviews and there's usually I read more like in depth to see what they're

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:56.000
trying to say and see if there's a common consensus across them.

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:59.000
If it's just like, all right, fucking hate this.

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.000
You know, there's a lot of people that will just hate on anything.

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000
So it's hard to say.

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:04.000
Let's see.

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:05.000
Comments from chat.

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:08.000
SSG100Matt says, sounds like this is mostly to curb downvote protests.

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
Oh, for sure.

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:11.000
Absolutely.

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:16.000
Other comments from chat asking or answering my question about, do you get swayed by these?

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:17.000
I'm actually kind of surprised.

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:19.000
It sounds like most people are saying yes.

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.000
JD says, yeah, sometimes.

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:27.000
MegaManX400 says, if the user reviews are overwhelmingly poor, then yes.

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:31.000
Fifth Dream says, yes, if people say it's technically shit or really, really crappy.

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:36.000
MXC says, I'll look at Steam reviews to gauge how long a game is.

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:41.000
Don't have time for a lot of super long stuff, so I generally seek out shorter titles.

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:42.000
Interesting.

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:46.000
SquatchKilla says, I use reviews on new games mostly.

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:50.000
If they get bad reviews, I might buy them later discounted.

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:56.000
So weighing if this is a buy it now or wait for a Steam sale sort of situation.

02:09:56.000 --> 02:10:00.000
So, wow, I guess I'm different in that regard.

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:05.000
I will use user reviews like friends on Twitter, people I know,

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:10.000
but I tend not to let randos on Steam influence my decision

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:13.000
because I know all these fucking campaigns are run all the time.

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:14.000
Right.

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:19.000
I was actually kind of surprised to see a lot of you do use that.

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000
Now I feel weird.

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:24.000
Well, why do you feel weird about it?

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:25.000
No, I don't know.

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:29.000
I thought everybody kind of took the Yelp approach to Steam

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:32.000
where it's like, oh, you're only ever going to read the bad stuff.

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000
That's how Yelp is to me.

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:37.000
Like you either somebody went to Yelp because they're like,

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:40.000
no, I have 300 friends on my Facebook.

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000
I'm going to slander your company to me and, you know,

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:46.000
write something negative on Facebook or Yelp or whatever.

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:50.000
Or it's the fucking owner's friend and they wrote a five star review.

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:54.000
Like you very rarely find the honest shit in between on those sites.

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:58.000
So like I don't pay attention to a lot of those, that stuff.

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:01.000
And so I kind of have that attitude with video games.

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:04.000
I'm like everything is either a hundred percent or zero percent

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:07.000
and it's never truly in between.

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:08.000
But again, it's personal.

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:11.000
I'm not, you know, that's why I asked the question.

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.000
I wanted to see what you guys kind of did with that.

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:16.000
So let's see.

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:20.000
Oh, SSU100Matt in chat says, I wrote a negative Yelp review on a mechanic

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:23.000
and I got bribed to take it down by the shop.

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:28.000
See, I use Yelp to find places that are open

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
because they have business hours listed in there.

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
That's the most I use Yelp for.

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:33.000
I don't read reviews anymore.

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:35.000
There's too much fuckery that goes on.

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:39.000
Well, not always because like my wife left a negative Yelp review yesterday

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:41.000
for Chinese places that we went to.

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:44.000
And she looked at it, you know, because I guess the food,

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:47.000
we've been there before and the food's been good.

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:52.000
And then lately she got it and like they were skimping on all the like meat

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:56.000
and then the like shrimp that she took a bite of the shrimp in the soup.

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000
She's like, ah, that shrimp is not good, you know?

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:02.000
And she called up to let them know, hey, your shrimp is probably bad.

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:05.000
They no apology, not even concerned.

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:08.000
They're just like me and just like kind of brushed her off.

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
And she's like, well, I'm going to leave a review then.

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:14.000
And like last six months, there's been a ton of negative reviews from place

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000
probably because it's like on our new ownership or something.

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000
So it's good to kind of gauge it.

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000
But yeah, I mean, people were only right views

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000
if they have something negative to say for the most part.

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:23.000
I mean, so I don't know.

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.000
So I always take that stuff with a grain of salt.

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:26.000
That's just, that's just me.

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.000
Anyway, uh, let's move on.

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:32.000
As Joe and Matt wanted to make it clear, I didn't take the bait.

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
All right. All right. All right.

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:35.000
Let's move on.

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:38.000
Oh, hey, I actually have news to talk about in Pokemon Go,

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000
even though I think we've kind of already addressed this.

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:43.000
But if you didn't know, there was this big event going on in Pokemon Go

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:48.000
called the Global Catch Challenge, where basically Niantic was daring you

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:51.000
to catch 3 billion Pokemon in a week.

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:54.000
And did they do it? Yes, they did.

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:58.000
So the players of Pokemon Go did catch 3 billion Pokemon,

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:04.000
which unlocked Double XP, Double Stardust for, I think, till December 1st.

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:11.000
And the biggest one of all, Farfetch'd, the bird that's carrying the leak,

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:15.000
has been unleashed worldwide for 48 hours.

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:19.000
So that means you have about 24 more hours to catch a Farfetch'd

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:20.000
if you haven't already got one.

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:23.000
And they, they have been spawning on my house.

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:25.000
So maybe I'm checking right now. Yeah.

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.000
Yeah. I checked my house.

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:30.000
I'm not going to go out to try to catch one, but you know.

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
But if you do, you only have 24 more hours to do it.

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:35.000
But they're, they're not, at least I know I'm not sleeping.

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000
They're not terribly hard to find.

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:41.000
Like they are, they're spawning about as common as, as the, uh,

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:46.000
Shuppets on like those dust skulls were fucking everywhere.

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:49.000
The Shuppets were plentiful, but not everywhere.

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:50.000
That's kind of where Farfetch'd is at.

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:51.000
I just caught a Pikachu.

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:53.000
Well, Pikachu spawn on my house all the time.

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:54.000
I don't know why.

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
He's on a Pikachu nest.

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
No, but it's not even a nest because nests rotate.

02:13:58.000 --> 02:13:59.000
Right.

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:00.000
So I don't know what it is.

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
They must know that nerds live here.

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:03.000
So we get Pikachu all the time.

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:05.000
So there you go.

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:09.000
Maybe that's my reward for playing so much fucking Ingress in Pokemon Go.

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:10.000
Niantic knows me personally.

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:12.000
And puts Pikachu on my house.

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:13.000
That's my little.

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.000
This is Rob's house and we're going to put all the Pikas there.

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:18.000
If that's good, how about a fucking shiny Pikachu then?

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
Cause that's the one thing I don't have.

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:21.000
Are there shinies?

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:25.000
Yeah, they have like a gray thing on their tail instead of it being like black.

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:26.000
Very few.

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:30.000
Uh, Pikachu has a shiny in Pokemon Go.

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:31.000
That is in the regular series.

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:33.000
Obviously most everything does with some exceptions.

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:38.000
Uh, in Pokemon Go, the gen three Halloween all have shinies.

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:42.000
So, Shuppet, Duskull, and, um, Sableye.

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
Uh, Pikachu has a shiny.

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000
Magikarp has a shiny.

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:47.000
I think that's it.

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000
I feel like there might be one other I'm forgetting.

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.000
But those are all the shinies that exist in the game right now.

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:52.000
So.

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:53.000
Alright.

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:55.000
Uh, but there you go.

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:56.000
So Farfetch'd was unlocked.

02:14:56.000 --> 02:15:04.000
And, um, oh, it wasn't just Farfetch'd because now if you lived in East Asia, Japan,

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:11.000
where Farfetch'd was your local Pokemon, you'd feel pretty screwed that the whole world got, you know, your Pokemon.

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:16.000
Well, they got Kangaskhan in exchange, which was the Australia exclusive.

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:20.000
So, they, Asia got some of this too so that they got something that was new to them.

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:21.000
So, there you go.

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:28.000
Although, if you were lucky enough to be in Anaheim for Pokemon Worlds, you may also have a Kangaskhan living in the US.

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:32.000
So, the only one that has not been released in the US at this point is Mr. Mime.

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000
So, we'll see.

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:36.000
Alright.

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:37.000
Mr. Mime!

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:38.000
Okay.

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:39.000
Not Mr. Smoosh, but Mr. Mime.

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:40.000
Mr. Smoosh is cuter.

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:41.000
That's right.

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:42.000
Mr. Smoosh is way cuter and so-

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
We like his little face.

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:50.000
A few more stories before we open up the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:55.000
If you have the Skype app, you can just add Orange Lounge Radio and give us a call in a little bit.

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:58.000
Or, of course, the desktop version works too.

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:02.000
And I think it's like fucking built into Windows 10, isn't it, so everybody has Skype.

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:03.000
Yes.

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:04.000
You can't really-

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:05.000
Guess who's not on Windows?

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:06.000
Your Xbox has it.

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:07.000
Sorry.

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:08.000
I meant to set up the laptop.

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:09.000
I haven't forgotten.

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:10.000
I just-

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
That actually wasn't a read on that whole thing.

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:13.000
I forgot about that too.

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:14.000
I know.

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:15.000
Alright.

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:16.000
Anyhow.

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:17.000
Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:20.000
Number one, people need to stop posting articles about cookie butter.

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:24.000
Did you know that that's like the Oreo flavor right now is cookie butter Oreos?

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:25.000
What?

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:27.000
It's a cookie already.

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:28.000
You don't need cookie butter.

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:31.000
No, cookie butter is fucking magical.

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:35.000
My favorite was when Oreo had the cookies and cream flavored Oreo.

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:38.000
I was like, did they feed the cow beef?

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:41.000
It's meta Oreo.

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:42.000
Anyway.

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:43.000
I heard you like Oreos.

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:45.000
Here's your Oreo in your Oreo.

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:47.000
This is why I love our chat room.

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:48.000
Like I said earlier in the show-

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
Did anyone buy any Prongles during the break?

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
Once you pop, that's great.

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:53.000
No.

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:55.000
So, this is why I love our chatters.

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:59.000
Even though I said earlier in the show, we'll never be famous, but we have a great turnout here.

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:03.000
Is because everybody's like, oh no, cookie butter is serious shit.

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:05.000
Cookie butter is the shit.

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:08.000
And fifth dream ask, is cookie butter a white person thing?

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:09.000
I don't know.

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:13.000
Cookie butter has been out in Europe for quite a while.

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:14.000
It's from Belgium.

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:21.000
It's called Speculoos along with our, what was the other thing from Belgium that we had?

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:23.000
The Stroke Waffle.

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:30.000
But it's basically just this buttery, delicious cookie paste.

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
By the way, can we talk about Stroke Waffle for a minute?

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
Stroke Waffle.

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:37.000
Because, yeah, I know I mispronounced it, but I don't care.

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:43.000
I opened the mail this week and I have a big envelope in the mail and it's kind of thick.

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.000
I'm like, what the hell did somebody send me in the mail?

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:49.000
And it's from Ranma, our good pal Ranma who calls into the show frequently.

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:51.000
And I'm like, what the hell is this?

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:55.000
And so I open it up, I open up the first envelope, there's another envelope inside it.

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:59.000
And I'm like, I swear to God, this is one of the things where you keep like, it's like the Russian dolls.

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:03.000
You keep opening the box and I get to the middle and there's just a middle finger printed out on it.

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:06.000
I'm gonna be so mad. I'm gonna fly out to New York and beat him up.

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000
But it was a much better ending.

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:16.000
So inside the second envelope were tiny little miniature Stroke Waffles that I think he got in, still in the wrapper,

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:19.000
that I think he got at some anime convention or someplace that he was at.

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:22.000
He fucking mailed me Stroke Waffles.

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:25.000
And again, this is why I love our listeners, especially Ranma.

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:31.000
Well, I told you my friend in Belgium who I met through Dragon Age fan fiction.

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:36.000
We did a food exchange. I sent her Pop-Tarts and she sent me like the packaged sugar waffles.

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:40.000
That's what they fucking want in Europe and Netherlands and everything on the other side of the pond.

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000
They want the fucking Pop-Tarts.

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:45.000
I sent like Orange Crush Pop-Tarts.

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:47.000
Well, yeah, because they don't have anything but like strawberry and blueberry.

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:49.000
We have all the weird shit.

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:51.000
I basically sent a gift of diabetes.

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:53.000
Anyway.

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:55.000
So, story.

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:57.000
Oh, yes. Where were we?

02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:59.000
Super Nintendo World!

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:03.000
So there's a few more details for Universal Studios in Florida.

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:08.000
The area for the Super Nintendo World is going to be 8.8 acres in size

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:14.000
and will be built behind Simpsons Land in where currently the kid zone is.

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000
The E.T. ride will stay there.

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:19.000
There will be 48 toilets in total.

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:21.000
It will take about 3 years to build.

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:28.000
And it will be open sometime just after Japan's Universal Studios Nintendo Park opens.

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:33.000
There are sections mentioned for Donkey Kong and Mario Kart.

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:37.000
Both of which will be in both parks.

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000
So, um.

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:42.000
Yes, act deft.

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:45.000
I still would like some Not Nutella Oreos again, please.

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:47.000
Theme park.

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:50.000
I'm not going to be able to eat this stuff before too long.

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:51.000
I know.

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:53.000
Sad face.

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:55.000
Give me all the candy!

02:19:55.000 --> 02:20:00.000
So there was also a Twitter post by Chip Scambis.

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:04.000
Who, um, I don't know where he factors into it.

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
Maybe he is.

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:09.000
He is a designer at Universal.

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:18.000
And he was saying that they are going to do a dining area with a total seating capacity of 365 seats as well.

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000
What kind of Nintendo food?

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000
Are they going to bring back Nintendo cereal?

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:26.000
I'm fucking there if I can go buy Nintendo cereal at one of the food carts.

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000
What if we have conga churros?

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:29.000
What if...

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:32.000
What if they did banana lumpia?

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:39.000
What if they did those milkshakes, but instead of Froot Loops or whatever, they put Nintendo cereal in it?

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:43.000
Or what if they have Star Cupcakes?

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:45.000
But no, what if they just did banana milkshakes?

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:46.000
Anyway.

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
Donkey Kong banana milkshakes.

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000
Banana milkshakes are the fucking best.

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:53.000
It doesn't matter what we talk about. It just evolves into food.

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.000
But those maple cookies were good.

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:56.000
Yes, they were.

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
Okay. That's it.

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.000
Well, when are they going to...

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:03.000
When are they going to, excuse me, open this place? I want to go.

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:05.000
I didn't find that.

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:07.000
They said it was a few years.

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:09.000
They said it should take about three years to construct.

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:11.000
Don't die, please.

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:15.000
I think the last thing I read was Japan is supposed to have theirs just before the Olympics in 2020.

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:19.000
And then everybody else gets theirs shortly after, so that wouldn't surprise me.

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:20.000
Yeah.

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:23.000
Don't die, Rob.

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:26.000
Just a few more stories and then we'll get to the Skype line. Loki.

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:31.000
Alright. So apparently, there's more Kickstarter shenanigans.

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:35.000
So there's a developer of this game called Project Phoenix.

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:44.000
I guess the director of that is being accused of embezzling one million dollars from the Kickstarter campaign.

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:50.000
So apparently, yes, it starts off with the game developer, Tariq Lacy,

02:21:50.000 --> 02:22:02.000
has accused the director, Hiroaki Yura, of stealing money from the Kickstarter of Project Phoenix to fund his latest game, Tiny Metal.

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:07.000
And basically saying that the...

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:19.000
And of course, Yura is making his own allegations saying that, you know, Lacy is accusing Lacy of sexual harassment, which of course they deny.

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:22.000
And it's basically back and forth and that type of thing.

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:27.000
So there is... I guess this has been quite a long project.

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:30.000
It first popped up in 2013.

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:41.000
And I guess since then, you know, it's raised over one million dollars from about 15... almost 16,000 backers.

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:46.000
And then 2015, so the game would be delayed for another three years.

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:51.000
And in April 2017, told the backers that he planned to release a different game first.

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:59.000
He explained that he had found some investors who would be willing to help back Project Phoenix if his new game succeeded.

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:06.000
And that new game was Tiny Metal, which I guess is scheduled to release December 21st.

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:12.000
And now, of course, you know, it just seems like this stuff keeps getting pushed back and pushed back.

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:20.000
So he went and turned to Facebook to basically kind of accuse Yura's company of running a scam.

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:29.000
So basically said, two months after I was hired to Area 35, I had learned that the company funded this project by running a scam through Kickstarter.

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:39.000
They gathered several famous creators and ran a campaign known as Project Phoenix, then used the one million dollars received from the campaign to fund Tiny Metal project.

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:48.000
Here's how it happened. After they received the Kickstarter money for Project Phoenix, they shut down the original company, Creative Intelligent Arts, or CIA,

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:55.000
and then used the same money to establish Area 35 and pay for staff equipment and the office to make Tiny Metal.

02:23:55.000 --> 02:24:07.000
And I guess the company's CEO asked me to deflect any accusations that this money was from any other companies or other than private investors.

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:21.000
In actuality, Hiroaki only dipped into his own funds and asked for money from private investors after funding what he had secured for Tiny Metal was running low.

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:25.000
I don't know. This is kind of why I stay away from Kickstarter.

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:31.000
This is why, yeah, I'm kind of like over Kickstarter at this point, which is a bummer because there's a lot of people out there that are using it legitimately.

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:39.000
But there's just, there's too much fuckery going. This is the theme of the night, fuckery. There's too much fuckery going on on Kickstarter, kind of like this stuff.

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:52.000
I want to just quickly say dungeonbuster in our chat at live.fognetwork.com says, just for context, Divinity Original Sin and its sequel have been released in the time Project Phoenix Kickstarter started, ended, and ran into problems, and is still not done.

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:57.000
I'm still waiting for blood-stained ritual tonight.

02:24:57.000 --> 02:25:00.000
True, but we at least have seen something playable of that.

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:06.000
Yeah, and I know I'm not going to get swindled on that, but it's like, you know, we sometimes forget when we back these Kickstarters.

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:10.000
It takes a long fucking time to make a video game, don't it, Loki?

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:13.000
Well, it helps if you're actually working on the game.

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:15.000
It sure does, yes.

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:20.000
It sure does. Or know which game you're actually working on because, you know, there's that too.

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:24.000
Anyway, we're about to open up the Skype line. Give us a call if you want.

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, and you can talk to us about anything we've talked about tonight, or maybe you have something different.

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:34.000
While we wait for some calls to come in, I got one more story for you guys here.

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:39.000
Oh god, it's another loot box story, but this one is very tongue-in-cheek. I like this.

02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:48.000
It's a mod for the original Doom that turns it into Doom with loot boxes.

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:52.000
It's a tongue-in-cheek third-party mod that makes some adjustments to gameplay.

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:57.000
It removes weapons and power-ups on the map, and you get a UAC crate instead.

02:25:57.000 --> 02:26:06.000
To open the crate, you need a key, which you have a chance of obtaining randomly with every enemy kill, or, of course, you can go into the shop and buy keys.

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:14.000
Although, since the whole thing is a joke, it just says the servers are down if you try to actually buy any particular key, and that's it.

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:26.000
So, there you go. So, with the keys that you can find, rarely you might get a shotgun, but you probably won't get that rocket launcher or BFG or the stuff you really need to beat Doom.

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:32.000
Anyway, there's a popular YouTube video showing this off out there by a user from ZDoomForums.

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:40.000
The username is stronkytonky is the user that put out this YouTube video where you can see him just get really frustrated at this.

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:44.000
He does finally find 10 keys after 600 kills.

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:50.000
Anyway, obviously the whole thing is supposed to be very tongue-in-cheek and a parody of the whole loot box thing, but it does kind of make you wonder,

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:55.000
God, where could this industry be right now if people had figured this out a while ago?

02:26:55.000 --> 02:27:06.000
I guess we should be thankful that the 14.4K modem speeds we had back in the day that Doom was released, probably not fast enough to run loot boxes.

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:10.000
Well, here's the other thing, too, since we're talking about loot boxes.

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:16.000
So, there was an article that was on Polygon talking about Battlefront 2, and so what's going on with Battlefront 2 now?

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:19.000
People are AFK grinding this stuff, and so they're doing-

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:21.000
Oh, yeah, so somebody built like a contraption.

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:29.000
Yeah, there's a few things. So, there's someone that built it like a robot to kind of push buttons and move the stick and stuff like that randomly.

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:37.000
And then there's just people that are using rubber bands to move the analog sticks so that they run around in a circle or something like that.

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:49.000
And so, yeah, that's got to hurt the game as well because now people are basically just doing that, and you're getting in games with people that are AFK, and so that kind of sucks.

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:53.000
So, of course people are going to cheat the system like that because they feel it's unfair.

02:27:53.000 --> 02:28:03.000
Well, and now, I mean, for better or for worse, depending on your opinions on this whole thing, Battlefront 2 has become like the kick box.

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:04.000
The dead horse?

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:08.000
Yeah, just the thing that everybody just beats up on as the symbol of-

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:09.000
The scapegoat.

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:12.000
Yeah, the scapegoat. The goat simulator.

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:13.000
Hey, goat simulator is awesome.

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:21.000
No, yeah, goat simulator is awesome, but I think of some of those scenes of goat simulator with the goat flinging through the air with those rubber band physics and stuff.

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:29.000
That's what EA's Battlefront game has become with this whole loot box thing is it's now everybody's kicking boy or whatever. What do they call it? Kicking dog? I don't know.

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:30.000
Whipping boy.

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:37.000
Whipping boy. That's it. Whipping boy is what this game has become. So, I mean, of course everybody's going to try to exploit it.

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:46.000
If you want to exploit our Skype line, OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word, you can give us a call right now. I'll check in with Loki, see if he has any other last minute stories.

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:47.000
This was kind of a slower news week.

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:49.000
Yeah, I don't.

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:51.000
I'm kind of surprised we filled the show.

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:58.000
There's all the different sales. I didn't pick anything up on the Steam sales, although I was tempted to, but I've already bought enough games recently.

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:10.000
This is the first year I'm like, or the first sale. I'm not really motivated to finish the badge either. Like you have to go in and nominate a game in any, every category and they're meaningless awards. And I'm just like, eh.

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:13.000
I picked up a couple, but I forgot what I got.

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:17.000
I haven't bought anything. I don't know. I need to go back and look at the list.

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:20.000
Ooh, I got picked for a Valve hardware survey. Ooh.

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:22.000
Are they going to send you a free Steam box?

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:24.000
Probably not. I already have one.

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:27.000
They started, they practically started giving those things away at some point.

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:31.000
I paid five for mine. Yeah.

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:32.000
I got mine for a dollar.

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:33.000
I don't want to tell you how much I paid for mine.

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:35.000
I'd buy that for a dollar and I did.

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:37.000
I got you your controller.

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:45.000
I know. Yes, but I love the controller. The controller has that whole haptic feedback thing, which is in this phone too. And I love it.

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:46.000
It's been in my phone for an age.

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:47.000
Well, wait.

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:49.000
It came out with a 6s.

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:50.000
With a 6s.

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:59.000
But the controller I have for my Apple TV, though, is crap. Now I can't think of what it's called either.

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:06.000
But it's a really good controller and I want to see if it'll work with our Steam link because I have a few games on there that I want to start playing now.

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:07.000
That'll be fun.

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:08.000
I'll have to look up what I have.

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:17.000
Yeah, I haven't got a chance to hook up my Steam link yet. Maybe I'll leave that this week because I was going to use it now for media streaming since we have in our little box.

02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:26.000
My wife was teasing me this week. She was like, oh, we can go get a 4K TV this week if you want. I'm like, okay.

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:31.000
Well, the ones she was looking at really cheap. I was like, it needs to have HDR and all that stuff.

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:36.000
And I'm like, man, if we get a 4K TV, then I've got to get PlayStation Pro and stuff like that.

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:38.000
I don't want to spend that money.

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:43.000
By the way, I have the SteelSeries Nimbus wireless gaming controller.

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:46.000
I also have a SteelSeries controller.

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:47.000
It is fairly comfortable.

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:48.000
I do not.

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:49.000
When do I get mine?

02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:51.000
Well, they're basically like an Xbox 360 controller.

02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:52.000
That's cool.

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:57.000
But I think it feels a lot better put together. It's got a bit more heft in the hand, you know?

02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:58.000
Yes.

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:05.000
Well, gosh, some folks in chat are talking about should be doing a live stream of the Doom loot box thing.

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:08.000
I wish I'd thought of that before the show. That would've been a fun live stream to do tonight.

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:10.000
I am going to do a live stream after the show tonight.

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:13.000
I'm going to do my first time playing.

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:16.000
I bought it earlier today because I knew I would buy it eventually.

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:22.000
My first time playing Rocket League on Switch, which for those counting, this is now the third time.

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:24.000
No, actually, I take that back.

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:26.000
It's only the first time I've bought it.

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:31.000
It's the third version I own, but it's the first time I've bought it because it was free on PlayStation Plus.

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:34.000
It was gifted to me on Steam, so I bought it on Switch.

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:38.000
So, yeah, I'm going to check out Rocket League after the show.

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:43.000
So you can check that out on my Twitch channel over at Rob Roberts.

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:49.000
I bought another $4 Switch game, too, and I might get into playing that as well.

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:52.000
So we'll see. We'll do that.

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:56.000
My kids, by the way, created their own YouTube channel.

02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:59.000
Did they really? Let me just put one more call for calls.

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:02.000
I don't know if the Skype line is broken. I don't see anybody in chat complaining.

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.000
But Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000
I'm getting set up to start vlogging.

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:10.000
See, that blows my mind because you haven't wanted to do video.

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:13.000
Because I can adjust the camera angle on my own vlog.

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:17.000
I will put the camera. You can do whatever you want with it here.

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:18.000
We'll see.

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:19.000
All right. Okay.

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:27.000
But I have a plan for how I want to do it, so it's basically things will happen.

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:36.000
You totally need to go the route of Gendo, where he's just sitting there with the silhouette and the shine on his glasses.

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:38.000
That's the way you need to do it.

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:39.000
I could do that.

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:41.000
It's Gendo.

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:47.000
All right. Well, our Skype line is not lighting up tonight.

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:52.000
I think we might. I mean, I don't check live listener numbers because I don't obsess over things like that anymore.

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:57.000
But I could look at people that are checking in over at the Voice Geeks Network at vognetwork.com.

02:32:57.000 --> 02:33:03.000
Because we have a system, kind of like Foursquare used to be, where you can actually check into shows and you get points.

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:06.000
And you even get loot, not loot boxes, but loot.

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:09.000
Just fun things for your vog network profile and stuff.

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:14.000
And so I see, actually, we have more people checked in tonight than our last episode.

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:18.000
But not as many as two weeks ago, or two shows ago.

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:20.000
Did you know this?

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:22.000
I would assume the holiday weekend where I just have a lower turnout.

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:26.000
Did you know that Nier Automata is one of the games on the Steam sale right now?

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:27.000
40% off?

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:28.000
How much then?

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:30.000
That makes it $35.99.

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:32.000
I hear a lot of good things about that game.

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:34.000
I'm considering it, but I just had my hair done.

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:36.000
That's like Game of the Year level game.

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:40.000
But Okami HD is also $20. It's not on sale, but it's just $20.

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:43.000
There's another game, though, that's been kind of catching my interest.

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:48.000
And I'm sure it's just pronounced Valhalla, but it's VA11 Hall A.

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:51.000
Cyberpunk Bartender Action.

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:55.000
The ROM 2064 guys support that a lot.

02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:58.000
Yeah, I've been considering getting that one.

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:01.000
So if anyone's playing it, let me know what you think of it.

02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:06.000
Apparently I was looking at a page called Deep Space Waifu on Steam.

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:09.000
I don't remember, I saw a link to that, but it's like 99 cents.

02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:12.000
And it kind of looks like it's a SHMUP game.

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:17.000
It's like a SHMUP game with anime babes or something.

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:18.000
Of course, because why not?

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:21.000
I'm not really sure what the point of that is, but it looks silly.

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:22.000
In cyanide sense.

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:25.000
SquatchKilla in chat over at live.voggenetwork.com says,

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:29.000
My son keeps asking to start a YouTube channel with myself.

02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:33.000
You know, hey, some people make a lot of money doing that stuff.

02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:35.000
Actually, should I say that?

02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:36.000
Ok, I'm going to say it.

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:42.000
I have made my first threshold on Twitch where I'm getting a check.

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:43.000
Huzzah!

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:46.000
Yeah, I don't think I see it till next month.

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:49.000
Which I have not been doing a lot of streaming lately.

02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:51.000
I was doing a lot of it when I was pushing first affiliate.

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:53.000
I've really scaled back and I apologize to you guys.

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:59.000
You guys just know I've had a really rough year and it's just hard for me to be extroverted several times throughout the week.

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:01.000
And I think most of you guys kind of know that and I really appreciate it.

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:06.000
I just feel like, oh god, I wish I could pull my shit together and do that more for the subscribers that I have.

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:08.000
But it's hard.

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:10.000
I would love to do that.

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:12.000
I don't have a place to do that.

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:14.000
I don't have the gear to do that.

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:23.000
And going back to place to do that, I don't have a place that I can talk with where the sound isn't going to bother my wife.

02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:26.000
Or wake up my kids because it would have to be when they were asleep.

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:28.000
Unless they're going to do stuff on it.

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:31.000
We just don't have any room in the house to do that.

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:35.000
And I would love to start that.

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:37.000
I keep thinking about doing it in my garage.

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:45.000
But it's not really climate controlled and it smells like cat box and it's dirty as fuck.

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:47.000
I have an F.U.

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:49.000
We don't have to have the music for it.

02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:54.000
F.U. to people who go on Steam and ask me for free games.

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:56.000
Ask me to buy you a game.

02:35:57.000 --> 02:35:59.000
I'm going to out this person right now.

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:01.000
No, no, no. Don't do it.

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:04.000
I'm going to out you on Twitter.

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:06.000
If you do this again.

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:09.000
The answer will always fucking be no.

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:10.000
Interesting.

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:12.000
If you're someone who I don't know who you are.

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:16.000
Or you're just a random so and so on my list.

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:18.000
Don't fucking ask me to buy you anything.

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:20.000
Did you add somebody on the list who you kind of didn't know?

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:23.000
I thought they were in the community.

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:25.000
But they've been on there for a while.

02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:26.000
Interesting.

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:29.000
So no, the answer is always going to be no.

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:32.000
Unless like your birthday is coming up or something.

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:35.000
Or I think you're an okay person.

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:37.000
If you are just somebody on my friends list.

02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:39.000
The answer is always fucking no.

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:40.000
Yeah. Okay.

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:41.000
That's fair.

02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:42.000
Earn your own money.

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:43.000
Gifts or gifts?

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:45.000
Let's see. What was I going to say?

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:46.000
I would give you money for food.

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:48.000
But I'm not going to give you money for games.

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:51.000
This stream in chat says I get a free sub from Amazon Prime.

02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:53.000
So I threw it at Rob's channel so he can get monies.

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:54.000
Well, I really appreciate that.

02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:55.000
And I'll tell you what.

02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:57.000
The money is just going to go right back to OLR.

02:36:57.000 --> 02:37:03.000
Well, I mean, Bobby and I kind of both have some costs that we pay for Vaga Network.

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:07.000
So I actually pay for our radio feed that goes out there.

02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:10.000
Bobby takes care of all the website stuff and other stuff too.

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:12.000
I'm drawing a very crude line.

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:14.000
So the money is going to go right back into that.

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:18.000
And we are looking at doing some upgrades here with Loki and talking about the laptop.

02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:22.000
I think when that happens, I think I will be.

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:27.000
This mixing board has served us very well, but it has also served us for...

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:29.000
I remember when we placed the first mixing board.

02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:34.000
This was 2006, this mixing board.

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:37.000
Do you remember Dark Sakura when this mixing board came into play?

02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:40.000
It was, it wasn't cheap.

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:44.000
Yeah. So we'll probably replace that with something instead of analog, something digital.

02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:45.000
I'm buying a game right now.

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:46.000
Are you really?

02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:47.000
I'm buying 20XX.

02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:50.000
MXC points this out.

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:57.000
One of my friends has like 5,000 games on Steam and Rando's used to ask him for free games before going private.

02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:59.000
Oh, maybe somebody can see the size of the library.

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:00.000
That's kind of interesting.

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:01.000
Well, fuck them.

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:02.000
They just still know.

02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:05.000
You can ogle my library all you fucking want.

02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:07.000
Look, look and covet.

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:15.000
I do technically have extra Steam keys for a lot of games because I bought so many bundles that I'm sitting on multiple copies of a lot of things.

02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:17.000
But I haven't really...

02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:19.000
But you'll do that on your terms when you want to get those out.

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:20.000
Yeah.

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:22.000
I'm sorry. I will be that stingy bitch.

02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:23.000
It's, it's fine.

02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:28.000
S2100 Mountain Chat says the mixing board survived the Drunami mixing board table destruction.

02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:31.000
Actually, I think that was the one before this.

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:33.000
You remember the black mixing board we had?

02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:34.000
The old mixing...

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:39.000
Okay, for those that have seen the YouTube, I know we're just rambling tonight, but this is what happens when you don't call.

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:40.000
We ramble.

02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:44.000
So the black mixing board, you can, that's the old one.

02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:48.000
And you can actually see that in our rarely used YouTube channel.

02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:49.000
No, I take that back.

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:51.000
We actually have a stock of back episodes on there.

02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:52.000
Jason was working very hard.

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:53.000
I'll take it.

02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:56.000
It was in the, it was in the NBC, the channel three.

02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:58.000
Oh, it's so much fun video.

02:38:58.000 --> 02:38:59.000
Yeah.

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:03.000
Which is on YouTube on our orange lounge radio channel.

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:04.000
That was the first mixing board.

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:05.000
That was the black one.

02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:07.000
Now we have a gray one that Jamie just snapped a picture of.

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:08.000
So maybe she's posting.

02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:09.000
It's going to go on my Insta.

02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:10.000
There you go.

02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:15.000
So, but we're looking at, at least I'm thinking about, cause you'll notice it's all analog.

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:17.000
And so I'm thinking about something maybe more digital.

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:18.000
So we'll see.

02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:24.000
Well, and I actually, I know we've talked about me having a second set up with my MacBook.

02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:27.000
You may take this and vlog away with it or whatever you want to do with it.

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:30.000
Well, but it also would be good, I think, to have a fallback for travel.

02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:34.000
Cause I can just, you know, we've tested using GarageBand.

02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:35.000
Yep.

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:36.000
And it was all right.

02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:37.000
It was all right.

02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:38.000
It wasn't the...

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:39.000
It was more the difference.

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:40.000
Yeah.

02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:43.440
It was, it wasn't quite the clear quality that this show has, but it's good for like,

02:39:43.440 --> 02:39:47.480
if we want to do something at this DDR tournament coming up and we need something quick and

02:39:47.480 --> 02:39:48.840
dirty, it'll work.

02:39:48.840 --> 02:39:54.000
I ordered an iPhone condenser mic for vlogging.

02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:55.000
Yes.

02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:57.960
I've actually thought about getting one of those two for the conventions and stuff.

02:39:57.960 --> 02:40:01.140
The one I ordered, I ordered a cheap one to test it out, but there's another one that

02:40:01.140 --> 02:40:06.160
was recommended that's about 50 bucks, but it's, it's more of an omni-directional and

02:40:06.160 --> 02:40:07.160
you can change it.

02:40:07.160 --> 02:40:08.160
Yeah.

02:40:08.160 --> 02:40:11.560
So that one's on my list too, but I needed something, you know, I'm not going to spend

02:40:11.560 --> 02:40:14.800
anything big because my iPhone 10 I'm going to get in January.

02:40:14.800 --> 02:40:15.800
So.

02:40:15.800 --> 02:40:17.800
There you go.

02:40:17.800 --> 02:40:21.440
I've also got a steady cam ready to order too.

02:40:21.440 --> 02:40:22.440
What's a steady cam?

02:40:22.440 --> 02:40:23.440
Oh, for your vlog.

02:40:23.440 --> 02:40:24.440
Cause you want to do vlogging.

02:40:24.440 --> 02:40:27.800
Well, the thing, the good thing with the steady cam is that it uses a counterweight so that

02:40:27.800 --> 02:40:31.600
no matter how you swing it, you have a steady spread the whole time.

02:40:31.600 --> 02:40:36.440
I notice, uh, iPhone 10 and I only know, I don't, I can't compare it to anything Android

02:40:36.720 --> 02:40:38.840
because I only know what I have and that's iPhone.

02:40:38.840 --> 02:40:41.760
You can't control awesome to compare awesome to suck.

02:40:41.760 --> 02:40:43.980
But the video quality is really good.

02:40:43.980 --> 02:40:47.360
Like I was filming stuff at that, which by the way, we never got to talk about.

02:40:47.360 --> 02:40:49.680
And you're, this is what you get when you don't call.

02:40:49.680 --> 02:40:53.120
Dar Sacher wasn't able to talk about the Trixie and Katia's high school reunion thing with

02:40:53.120 --> 02:40:54.840
me on the show last week.

02:40:54.840 --> 02:40:58.840
But I shot some video there and I noticed, wow, like it doesn't shake.

02:40:58.840 --> 02:41:02.120
Like the anti-shake stuff is really good stabilization in there.

02:41:02.120 --> 02:41:03.120
Yeah.

02:41:03.120 --> 02:41:06.420
And then like, as I'm panning back and forth, it's really smooth in the, so I was, I'm pretty

02:41:06.420 --> 02:41:07.400
impressed.

02:41:07.400 --> 02:41:11.180
Like what you're, and I can't see why androids don't have something better for a thousand

02:41:11.180 --> 02:41:12.180
dollars.

02:41:12.180 --> 02:41:15.100
I'm just really impressed at the fucking technology.

02:41:15.100 --> 02:41:19.180
So if anyone's curious, it's on my Instagram, which is just dark Sakura.

02:41:19.180 --> 02:41:22.300
So I put up the, the board in all of its dusty glory.

02:41:22.300 --> 02:41:23.300
Yeah, I do.

02:41:23.300 --> 02:41:25.740
I need to get some kind of compressed air and give that thing a bath.

02:41:25.740 --> 02:41:28.140
You need microfiber cloths.

02:41:28.140 --> 02:41:29.140
That's a pledge.

02:41:29.140 --> 02:41:31.780
You know, my other thing is that I don't want to move any of the knobs.

02:41:31.780 --> 02:41:32.780
I know.

02:41:32.780 --> 02:41:33.780
I take a picture of the way it is.

02:41:33.780 --> 02:41:34.780
I can set everything back.

02:41:34.780 --> 02:41:35.780
I know.

02:41:36.140 --> 02:41:37.820
All right, well, the phone's not ringing.

02:41:37.820 --> 02:41:41.140
That means you ain't calling or it's broken, but again, I don't see anyone complaining,

02:41:41.140 --> 02:41:42.140
but that's fine.

02:41:42.140 --> 02:41:43.140
Y'all are just being shy.

02:41:43.140 --> 02:41:44.140
It's cool.

02:41:44.140 --> 02:41:45.140
It's cool.

02:41:45.140 --> 02:41:46.140
Maybe next week.

02:41:46.140 --> 02:41:47.140
Uh, we're going to wrap up the show for now though.

02:41:47.140 --> 02:41:48.620
Uh, that's it.

02:41:48.620 --> 02:41:49.740
We'll see you in seven days though.

02:41:49.740 --> 02:41:50.740
We'll be back here.

02:41:50.740 --> 02:41:56.140
I may be running a little late cause I'm going to be running back from San Francisco and

02:41:56.140 --> 02:42:02.020
the Ingress event happening there because technically the big hoedown showdown is Saturday,

02:42:02.020 --> 02:42:03.860
but then Sunday is the mission day.

02:42:03.940 --> 02:42:08.020
Now with as long as I've been doing Ingress, I have yet to do a single fucking mission

02:42:08.020 --> 02:42:09.020
day.

02:42:09.020 --> 02:42:13.860
I missed the one in Chicago because I was flying home on Sunday, so I'm doing this one.

02:42:13.860 --> 02:42:17.740
Even if this show is going to start late because of traffic, I'm fucking doing mission day

02:42:17.740 --> 02:42:23.060
to get that fucking badge on my fucking profile that doesn't mean anything.

02:42:23.060 --> 02:42:24.380
So there it is.

02:42:24.380 --> 02:42:25.860
So I think it'll be fine though.

02:42:25.860 --> 02:42:29.100
I think if I turn in the mission day thing by like two o'clock, three o'clock, that'll

02:42:29.100 --> 02:42:30.340
give me time to get home.

02:42:30.340 --> 02:42:32.540
I just may need Loki to produce next week episode.

02:42:33.220 --> 02:42:34.900
I want to do a mission thingy.

02:42:34.900 --> 02:42:35.900
I've never done one.

02:42:35.900 --> 02:42:37.820
Come, come up to the city on Sunday.

02:42:37.820 --> 02:42:41.260
Even if you don't want to do the Ingress, uh, hoedown throwdown on Saturday, you can

02:42:41.260 --> 02:42:42.260
come do the mission day thingy.

02:42:42.260 --> 02:42:43.860
Are you staying in the city?

02:42:43.860 --> 02:42:45.460
Uh, probably.

02:42:45.460 --> 02:42:51.020
I have to beg and plead my friend that I stay with, but I'm, I think I'd ran it by him already

02:42:51.020 --> 02:42:52.020
and he knows.

02:42:52.020 --> 02:42:54.300
I don't want to drive by myself.

02:42:54.300 --> 02:42:55.300
I'm sorry.

02:42:55.300 --> 02:42:57.940
Well, maybe who else plays here?

02:42:57.940 --> 02:43:00.500
No one who would go with me.

02:43:00.500 --> 02:43:01.500
You never know.

02:43:01.500 --> 02:43:02.500
We'll see.

02:43:03.460 --> 02:43:04.460
I'm not going to ride with people.

02:43:04.460 --> 02:43:05.460
I don't know.

02:43:05.460 --> 02:43:07.460
Like more than fleeting.

02:43:07.460 --> 02:43:08.460
No, I understand.

02:43:08.460 --> 02:43:09.460
I understand.

02:43:09.460 --> 02:43:10.460
All right.

02:43:10.460 --> 02:43:11.980
Uh, so there we go.

02:43:11.980 --> 02:43:12.980
Uh, yeah.

02:43:12.980 --> 02:43:16.140
So Squatch Kill is in chat saying, yes, I will be doing mission day.

02:43:16.140 --> 02:43:19.180
You wonder, you see, he, I know if anybody knows what I'm going through, he knows what

02:43:19.180 --> 02:43:20.220
I'm going through.

02:43:20.220 --> 02:43:27.900
So if my show is late next week, then it's all Squatch Kill's fault, just so you know.

02:43:27.900 --> 02:43:30.100
Or his wife's fault.

02:43:30.700 --> 02:43:33.220
Anyway, I hope she's listening.

02:43:33.220 --> 02:43:34.220
All right.

02:43:34.220 --> 02:43:39.220
Uh, Oh, I liked that as to what her Matt's like, can you just give them your phone?

02:43:39.220 --> 02:43:40.220
Hell the fuck?

02:43:40.220 --> 02:43:41.220
No.

02:43:41.220 --> 02:43:43.220
All right.

02:43:43.220 --> 02:43:44.220
There we go.

02:43:44.220 --> 02:43:45.220
We're going to wrap up.

02:43:45.220 --> 02:43:46.220
Thanks you guys.

02:43:46.220 --> 02:43:48.660
Uh, if you like what you heard here at orange launch radio, tell a friend or five about

02:43:48.660 --> 02:43:49.660
the show.

02:43:49.660 --> 02:43:52.580
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

02:43:52.580 --> 02:43:56.660
But like, like when the phones don't light up, we can't get those, uh, voices out there

02:43:56.660 --> 02:43:58.260
unless you, uh, let us know.

02:43:58.260 --> 02:43:59.260
You can always email us.

02:43:59.420 --> 02:44:00.420
You can tweet us at OLR.

02:44:00.420 --> 02:44:02.580
You can Facebook us at orange launch radio.

02:44:02.580 --> 02:44:07.300
You can use the website to send us a message because now we know that works.

02:44:07.300 --> 02:44:08.900
Remember when it was broken for four years?

02:44:08.900 --> 02:44:12.380
Well, we got our first email tonight that came from the website, so it works.

02:44:12.380 --> 02:44:16.000
So you can do all those things, but just tell a friend or two about the show.

02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:17.460
Help us spread the word.

02:44:17.460 --> 02:44:24.180
Um, because we don't have a big website or Fox news or CBS backing up this program.

02:44:24.180 --> 02:44:27.140
So it's just us.

02:44:27.140 --> 02:44:28.140
That's it.

02:44:28.140 --> 02:44:29.620
Uh, help us spread the word.

02:44:29.620 --> 02:44:32.100
Uh, I haven't found something really dirty to say.

02:44:32.100 --> 02:44:34.620
All right, well then we'll go around and get everybody's final thought.

02:44:34.620 --> 02:44:35.620
Oh yeah.

02:44:35.620 --> 02:44:36.620
Five star review on iTunes.

02:44:36.620 --> 02:44:37.940
Those places goes a long way too.

02:44:37.940 --> 02:44:40.620
We'll go around and get everybody's final thoughts since Jamie has something to say.

02:44:40.620 --> 02:44:43.220
I'm not going to say anything dirty cause I'm bad.

02:44:43.220 --> 02:44:44.220
We'll start with Loki.

02:44:44.220 --> 02:44:45.220
All right.

02:44:45.220 --> 02:44:50.940
Um, I guess I will, you know, play VR games this week.

02:44:50.940 --> 02:44:51.940
There you go.

02:44:51.940 --> 02:44:52.940
VR Skyrim.

02:44:52.940 --> 02:44:53.940
Who sold that?

02:44:53.940 --> 02:44:54.940
I didn't.

02:44:54.940 --> 02:45:02.020
I didn't buy it in because I've, I've already bought Skyrim and Skyrim HD and I have Skyrim

02:45:02.020 --> 02:45:04.180
HD in my PC and I haven't bothered.

02:45:04.180 --> 02:45:10.340
I was going to hold off in purchase on PCs someday when you know it's out cause I think

02:45:10.340 --> 02:45:14.140
it's going to be better because on the PlayStation it's just kind of okay.

02:45:14.140 --> 02:45:17.060
And eventually I do want to get VR headset for my PC.

02:45:17.060 --> 02:45:19.740
I just haven't done it yet.

02:45:19.740 --> 02:45:20.740
So I'm going to hold off.

02:45:20.740 --> 02:45:21.740
I don't need it.

02:45:21.740 --> 02:45:24.420
I just, I have a bunch of PlayStation VR games.

02:45:24.420 --> 02:45:26.260
I just bought them.

02:45:26.260 --> 02:45:27.940
I don't need another one.

02:45:27.940 --> 02:45:31.780
My final thought is, and I'm only thinking this cause I can see my collection of fridge

02:45:31.780 --> 02:45:35.580
magnets and I have a fridge magnet of this lady and I was just going to say Gilda Radner

02:45:35.580 --> 02:45:37.100
was fucking awesome.

02:45:37.100 --> 02:45:38.100
She was.

02:45:38.100 --> 02:45:39.100
She was so fucking awesome.

02:45:39.100 --> 02:45:40.500
Anyway, uh, dark soccer.

02:45:40.500 --> 02:45:41.500
Your final thought?

02:45:41.500 --> 02:45:45.820
Um, I'm going to go harass your cat now.

02:45:45.820 --> 02:45:46.820
It sounds good.

02:45:46.820 --> 02:45:52.180
Just get one of those fish cake things you had that he was, I digested them.

02:45:52.180 --> 02:45:53.180
All right.

02:45:53.180 --> 02:45:54.180
I'll burp fish out.

02:45:54.180 --> 02:45:55.180
I do.

02:45:55.180 --> 02:45:56.180
All right.

02:45:56.180 --> 02:45:57.180
That's it.

02:45:57.180 --> 02:45:58.180
Cats have no sense of sweetness.

02:45:58.180 --> 02:45:59.180
We're done.

02:45:59.180 --> 02:46:01.820
We'll be back in seven days later.

02:46:01.820 --> 02:46:05.220
You've been listening to orange lounge radio.

02:46:05.220 --> 02:46:11.140
