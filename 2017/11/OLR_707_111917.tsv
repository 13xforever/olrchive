7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	27000	There's a lot of headlines I could choose to read from tonight. Instead, I'm going to ask that we take a very critical look at ourselves and our peers. Choose togetherness and fun, not exclusive elitism and derision. Stay tuned for the discussion of this week's news, starting right now.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	45000	Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight for 19 November 2017, episode number 707 of our show.
46000	57000	My name is Rob Roberts, here to talk with you over the next few hours about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle. Here live in our studio, N7, based in lovely Sacramento, California.
57000	67000	Not here tonight, DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers. She will not be joining us tonight. She has some other hobbies and some other organizations she works with on the side.
67000	79000	And she's actually doing a charity fundraiser tonight because it is that kind of season for a lot of fundraising with Thanksgiving coming up the next week. A worthy reason for her to be gone tonight, so she will not be with us tonight. She'll be back next week.
79000	82000	Joining me in studio, though, is Techmaster Loki.
82000	83000	Hello.
83000	84000	Hi, Loki. How are you?
84000	85000	I'm fine.
85000	86000	Welcome back.
86000	87000	Yes.
87000	96000	So we weren't here last week because I was on vacation, so I hope you guys all had a good long weekend and what have you. Did you do anything exciting with your night off in the show?
96000	97000	No.
97000	101000	No? I'm sorry to hear that. No Lego building? No video game playing with the kids?
101000	107000	No, I think I took the kids somewhere. I don't remember what I did with them.
107000	108000	Gotcha.
108000	110000	I think we just went to the store.
110000	111000	I know, I can't even-
111000	126000	Oh, no, no. I remember now. We went to the mall because my wife was going to look at iPhones and then we went to the Apple store and I don't get how they think that that's how stores should be because that's stupid.
126000	127000	Was it overrun with people?
127000	135000	It was just dumb. It's like, oh, yeah, you have to make an appointment and wait 20 minutes for someone to help you buy a phone that you know you want. And my wife's like, fuck that.
135000	137000	You can get away with it because people do it.
138000	141000	But of course, I don't know, I bought my- I did buy the iPhone 10. I did it all online.
141000	146000	It's so courageous of them to lay their stores out in a really shitty configuration.
146000	147000	Oh, stop.
147000	154000	All right, always joining us here is our chat room because we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice geeks network of vognetwork.com.
154000	161000	Six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. And you can join us in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
161000	169000	It works again. Bobby, the good old- our pal Bobby Black Wolf, who does the show before us, he did the tech stuff behind the scenes and switched out the chat box.
169000	172000	So it does work again over at live.vognetwork.com.
172000	177000	Or if you're old school and have an IRC client, you can always just join the game search network and channel VOG.
177000	183000	And that's where we're at for those of you that know what I'm talking about. Not everybody even knows like what IRC is anymore.
183000	192000	We do have a Discord service for those of you that are into the newer stuff. You can check out our Discord server over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.
192000	194000	We'll get into some of that in just a little bit.
194000	204000	Yeah, I can't believe- time flies. Like I'm not surprised that you can't remember even going to the mall last week because Seattle feels like it was an eternity ago.
205000	207000	Well, it's- it was- yeah.
207000	214000	Even though it was just a week, right? So. But a lot happened in gaming over the past couple weeks.
214000	220000	But certainly one story has kind of taken the cake this week. So I think we need to kind of address that here at the top of the show.
220000	228000	And we just had like- I don't want to repeat ourselves too much because we just had a kickoff topic not even, what, three weeks ago involving loot boxes.
228000	229000	And yet this-
229000	230000	They're all the rage.
230000	235000	This has just really dominated the conversation in gaming culture over the past couple weeks.
235000	244000	And even- I got to give a shout out to our friend of the network Dungeon Buster who did some great articles kind of summarizing this over at vognetwork.com.
244000	249000	But the whole debacle over loot boxes in Star Wars Battlefront 2.
250000	260000	So I know many of you have been following this but Loki, for those that don't- aren't aware like what the problem is, can you kind of like dumb it down and summarize it for us?
260000	262000	What's the problem that people are having?
262000	275000	Sure. So the main complaint about loot boxes in Star Wars Battlefront 2 was that a lot of the things featured in those loot boxes were actual buffs to the game to basically give you an advantage.
275000	278000	So if you wanted to, you could pay to win in that game.
278000	290000	And so they were having things like, for example, one of the abilities that Boba Fett has while using his jetpack, he actually could be invulnerable.
290000	299000	So that's one of the things you can unlock if you pay enough money or happen to get enough loot boxes that would allow you to get those star cards.
299000	304000	And then I guess the whole progression system was also tied to how many cards you had.
304000	308000	It was just like very much integrated in the game.
308000	316000	And so, you know, people kind of heard that there was loot boxes in it and then they have this whole kind of early access type thing that they were doing.
316000	322000	I'm guessing with people that preordered the game or had some sort of special bundle that they bought.
322000	325000	No, it's that whole paying for EA subscription service.
325000	332000	The same thing happened with Andromeda when Mass Effect Andromeda went live on the EA access service, which you have to pay like a monthly fee to use.
332000	339000	People saw all the flaws early and it kind of shot the preorders, you know, as people were starting to cancel preorders.
339000	343000	It really shot the momentum that that game had on its release in the foot.
343000	345000	For better or for worse, I don't know.
345000	353000	Some people would say for worse because all those preorders getting cancelled kind of wrecked the series, even though a lot of those issues got taken care of via patch.
353000	361000	Some people would say for better because people should know that the game they're about to get does have bugs in it and was a little undercooked, I suppose.
361000	365000	Well, and that's what the issue was last year, was the game was undercooked.
365000	369000	I remember when it came out, it was very lacking content.
369000	377000	And then on top of that $60 game, they wanted you to pay $50 for a season pass to get the rest of the maps that probably should have been the game in the first place.
377000	383000	And some people were like, well, wait, why am I paying $110 for this game that was kind of just mediocre?
383000	385000	And so now this comes out.
386000	388000	And so what happened was people did math.
388000	403000	So it started with a post on Reddit where some guy figured out about how many credits you get per match and how much that would take, how long it would take, how many matches you would need before you would get loot boxes and how many loot boxes.
403000	411000	You can actually buy the characters directly as well, I think, or you can pay money to unlock certain things or you can try to gamble them in loot boxes.
411000	414000	So they just calculated how long it would take to do that.
414000	418000	And so originally it was like, okay, 40 hours to unlock.
418000	421000	I think it was like 40 hours or 120.
421000	424000	I don't remember now because they've switched it around so many times.
424000	427000	So a lot of hours, like 40 hours to unlock one character.
427000	431000	I think to unlock everything was like over 120, 160 hours.
431000	437000	So just like an insane amount of time to, you know, that's in game playing matches and stuff.
437000	439000	So that's quite a bit.
440000	446000	And then basically that, you know, a lot of people were just fucking pissed about that.
446000	451000	And so then I think EA kind of responded to one of the, you know, to that thread.
451000	457000	And I got, you know, the massive downvotes, you know, making history as one of the most downvoted threads ever.
457000	460000	The most downvoted comment and not by a little bit.
460000	461000	Yes, by several hundred thousand.
461000	464000	So, you know, people were very angry about that.
464000	473000	So EA kind of went back a little bit on it and they reduced the amount of the cost for those characters by 75%.
473000	475000	So it wouldn't take as long.
475000	484000	Also with that, though, they forgot to mention that they also reduced the amount of credits that you get at the end of the game by completing the game by 75% as well.
484000	490000	And then other things kind of snuck its way in, like cooldowns for playing arcade mode.
490000	502000	So people have been showing that there's, you know, like a three hour cooldown, but I've seen other screenshots where it could be 14 hours or a day before you can earn more points in the offline multiplayer mode.
502000	506000	So if you didn't even want to play online, you just want to unlock characters to play offline.
506000	508000	Yeah, good luck with it.
508000	519000	So would it be correct to say that the problem overall, and I'm going to really try to generalize the feedback we're hearing on a large scale because there's always going to be outliers and extreme opinions one way or the other.
519000	528000	But it would be safe to say the general problem with this loot box issue is that it's not the fact that Battlefront has loot boxes, it's the way they were implemented.
528000	531000	I think it's the way that they're implemented and that it seems very greedy.
531000	542000	And it's just been kind of slowly ramping up with all these games coming out just recently even having loot boxes in them and very like almost like shoehorning them in there in different ways.
542000	552000	Like with, you know, the whole Lord of the Rings game that came out that had that in there, the Shadow of War that kind of added those in last minute.
552000	559000	There was, you know, Call of Duty has been adding that stuff in there and it just seemed very out of place.
559000	568000	And there was the whole controversy about having the, you know, the patent for the different ways that they're kind of trying to manipulate you into getting loot boxes.
568000	576000	And even Battlefront kind of has that because, you know, when you finish the campaign, they could just unlock the character for you.
576000	587000	But no, they give you credits so that you have to go unlock a loot box so that you kind of get into that, ooh, you know, maybe I'll get something good or, you know, I could just buy this character outright or something like that.
587000	589000	Even if you wanted the character or not, I don't know.
589000	597000	Going to our chat room over at live.vog.network.com, Dungeonbuster who wrote those articles at VOG earlier this week actually is in our chat room commenting.
597000	603000	And I know his research has hit you well because his comments or his articles were very well sourced.
603000	608000	Dungeonbuster says, the grind is still bad. Credit awards at the end of matches are still pretty terrible.
608000	612000	A player that doesn't contribute as much can earn as many credits as the MVP.
613000	616000	Let's talk a little bit about what's kind of happened now.
616000	621000	So loot boxes were in there and then so there was feedback to say the least.
621000	623000	And so now EA has rolled back.
623000	629000	When I talk about feedback, though, I really quickly want to address because, you know, Jason kind of alluded to it in tonight's intro a little bit.
629000	633000	But there were obviously people on Twitter being shitty with death threats and things like that.
633000	634000	Hold on with that.
634000	639000	So with that, there was a dev that was complaining they were getting death threats.
639000	642000	And they came to find out Kotaku ran the whole thing on it.
642000	644000	That person wasn't actually a dev for EA.
644000	646000	It was just trolling.
646000	650000	So not to say that people would make death threats because people make death threats over stupid shit.
650000	652000	It's a really shitty thing.
652000	653000	But here's the thing, Loki.
653000	655000	It's easy to believe because it's happened before.
655000	659000	So it's, you know, like people need to stop being shitty for one.
659000	670000	But I would like to think for the most part that is just an extremely vocal, extreme minority of consumers whose opinions, honestly, if you're going to resort to that, don't matter.
670000	674000	I know you say we're the show where every gamer has a voice.
674000	677000	But if you're going to give death threats to people, not you, OK?
677000	680000	There's going to be a little asterisk by that.
681000	690000	The person that allegedly was on Twitter, they're not the people that are actually making these decisions.
690000	692000	Obviously, it's not that.
692000	694000	OK, so outliers aside.
694000	695000	So they pulled back.
695000	698000	They basically said, we hear you.
698000	708000	We're going to go ahead and disable purchases of those game currencies temporarily while we evaluate and balance.
708000	720000	Basically, their way of saving face to try to get people because there are some people that are easily forgive them and be like, oh, OK, well, they see they turned it off because they're not paying attention and they're going to go buy the game now.
720000	722000	That's what they were trying to do.
722000	729000	And also because allegedly someone from Disney contacted EA said, what the fuck are you doing with Star Wars?
729000	734000	And, you know, basically just trying that wasn't Dutch investor's second piece.
734000	736000	It sounds like it was actually Bob Iger.
736000	738000	That's that's up and up at Disney.
738000	747000	So that's pretty alarming if, you know, Disney got into that feedback and actually made a nasty phone call to EA.
747000	753000	But like, I honestly like I was kind of interested in this game originally when they showed like, oh, the single there's a single player campaign now.
753000	755000	And I was like, oh, that's a really cool twist.
755000	757000	And I was kind of excited to get on board that.
757000	758000	Not anymore.
758000	762000	Not even a plan on picking it up because it's just it's such a mess.
762000	768000	And I don't want to give them money for this kind of shit because all of the publishers are starting to do this shit.
768000	771000	And it's not. And we can dog on EA, but it's Activision.
771000	773000	It's Warner Brothers.
773000	774000	It's take two.
774000	777000	They're all doing this shit and it's getting worse.
777000	786000	And I don't and I understand Bobby wants to defend them by saying, you know, development costs are going up for 4K graphics or whatever the case may be.
786000	788000	But. Yeah, you know what?
788000	789000	I don't believe that.
789000	792000	And I think that a lot of this stems from I you know what?
792000	794000	Yes, the cost may be going up.
794000	796000	I don't think that's why they're doing it, though.
796000	797000	Don't get me wrong.
797000	802000	They know they can make money off of it because they've been doing this stuff with their ultimate team in FIFA.
802000	808000	And don't give me this shit that they really improve the game every year, like polishing those graphics.
808000	810000	Fuck, they do nothing to that shit.
810000	813000	OK, so they're making buku money off of this.
813000	819000	They've made they can see what the mobile market does and how people are spending money on this stuff.
819000	828000	And they're trying to integrate that into games because even Activision has said before they make more money off of in-game purchases than they do off the physical copies of their games.
828000	833000	So that's why they're doing these games as service stuff now, because they know they can make tons of money off of it.
833000	835000	And Battlefront 2.
835000	839000	Yeah, it's got great graphics and stuff, but the game is buggy as shit.
839000	844000	And a lot of these games that are coming out are still like feel like early access titles that are being released.
844000	846000	So I don't buy for a second.
846000	854000	If we were getting like higher quality games that are even more fun, I might be able to just kind of say, OK, well, I don't mind paying a little extra for that.
854000	859000	But they're already paying extra from upfront with all these different collectors and loot boxes and additions and stuff like that.
859000	865000	I'm pre-paying for DLC now, which is basically, you know, these season passes.
865000	869000	And half the time the games come out and they're broken or buggy.
869000	875000	Like look at the South Park game on PC. It was all fucked up just because rushed out.
875000	879000	So, OK, I agree with you and I don't agree with you.
879000	884000	And where I don't agree with you, I don't agree with you when you say that you don't believe that the games cost more to make.
884000	886000	They cost more to make, period.
887000	892000	There's stats to back that up, reports and how the industry is hiring. These companies are getting bigger.
892000	899000	And logically, to make a 4K video game, that is more artist hours to make a 4K texture.
899000	901000	That is going to be the case.
901000	909000	However, where I do agree with you is that I think this whole loot box thing is a case of it's worked well here.
909000	913000	So we're pushing it here and we're shoving it into this pigeonhole.
913000	916000	Because we have found that we can make money off loot boxes.
916000	927000	Like, you know, EA has gone on record saying that some Mass Effect 3 player spent like $15,000 legitimately not stolen on loot boxes.
927000	929000	So people will spend money on this shit.
929000	934000	Do we show numbers that EA is actually hiring more artists?
934000	936000	Are they paying them more money for this stuff?
936000	939000	Are they paying them any sort of dividends for the sales of these games?
939000	942000	Because the upfront costs of paying for these artists and stuff.
942000	945000	I mean, look at Grand Theft Auto 4 or 5 or whatever.
945000	950000	They spent millions of dollars on that and they recouped that money in just the standard game sales alone.
950000	954000	And then now you have all this microtransactions you get from...
954000	957000	Well, that's not so bad because it's just like DLC stuff.
957000	960000	It's not like loot boxes and stuff yet.
960000	966000	Well, yet, because I'm sure whatever they have cooked up for, you know, Red Dead 2 or something is going to be bad.
966000	969000	But they already have paid...
969000	974000	They've made so much money from this stuff already, recouped their money.
974000	976000	I just don't believe that...
976000	986000	Not all of these games that are costing $60 with these microtransactions in there are like these fantastic, incredible looking games.
986000	992000	They're just the same as the stuff that comes out from other companies that don't do this shit.
992000	994000	Look at The Witcher 3.
994000	997000	The Witcher 3 is a fucking great looking game.
997000	1000000	Very well reviewed.
1000000	1002000	Lots of detail in there.
1002000	1003000	High quality.
1003000	1006000	Free DLC for the most part, I think.
1006000	1009000	They're able to make a profit just...
1009000	1012000	There is some paid DLC for Witcher, but it's expansive.
1012000	1014000	There's a lot of free stuff in there as well.
1014000	1017000	But they're able to make their money just fine.
1018000	1023000	So why is it that another company can't do it as well?
1023000	1025000	And I get it, you're paying for the Star Wars IP.
1025000	1028000	But no one said you had to make a Star Wars game.
1028000	1031000	Let me ask a couple questions from your perspective, because here's my thing.
1031000	1037000	Would you be angry if they were charging, just say, hey, five bucks to play as Vader in the store?
1037000	1039000	Five bucks to do Vader, or five bucks to do...
1039000	1048000	In other words, instead of this loot box thing, just straight up a storefront that says it's straight up five bucks, ten bucks for these characters and these options.
1048000	1053000	Would that offend you, the way the loot box thing is?
1053000	1060000	I think it's a shitty practice, but that's what Capcom does with Street Fighter characters.
1060000	1065000	Where did we go from DLC to loot boxes?
1065000	1066000	They can make more money.
1066000	1067000	Because it's gambling.
1067000	1068000	It's gambling.
1068000	1074000	It's not technically gambling, but it's gambling because you're getting something random.
1074000	1079000	You don't know what you're getting, and a lot of times what you want is not what you're getting.
1079000	1083000	And so you're like, oh man, maybe the next time, and maybe the next time, and maybe the next time.
1083000	1090000	And it gets you in a cycle where you're spending more money than what it costs to buy the thing outright.
1090000	1093000	It's just like, you can look at an arcade, for example.
1093000	1095000	That's why they have crane games.
1095000	1101000	Yes, you're gambling that you can get that stuffed animal out of there for a dollar,
1101000	1106000	instead of paying the price of whatever it was that you would pay for from some place.
1106000	1109000	So that's kind of the gamble there.
1109000	1110000	You don't know.
1110000	1115000	I mean, obviously they have things working against you, but it's basically gambling.
1115000	1121000	You're taking a bet that you're going to put some money in there and get something really nice out, but it's not guaranteed.
1122000	1126000	And so people can get very addicted to that stuff.
1126000	1130000	Well, okay, but all this stuff aside, so I want to be fair.
1130000	1134000	I want to go to our chat room and read some other opinions here over at live.vognetwork.com.
1134000	1141000	Bobby is talking a lot in our chat saying it takes an artist longer to make something in 4K than it does to make something in 1080 than it does to make something in SD.
1141000	1146000	So even if the artist makes the same amount per hour as they did before, they are spending more hours on each item.
1146000	1150000	Witcher 3 was also made in Eastern Europe where they were able to pay the people less.
1150000	1153000	The devs there don't have as high of a salary as people in the US do.
1153000	1159000	That's where we outsource all of our developers when people don't want to pay for US devs, India and Eastern Europe.
1159000	1162000	Let's see, other comments in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
1162000	1165000	JD in chat says, crane games at least still have skill as a factor.
1165000	1171000	They're not completely random, even if the odds are stacked against you because the crane has been weakened, etc.
1171000	1176000	Dungeon Buster points out CD Projekt from Witcher 3 has GOG, which is sure to help with the bills.
1176000	1181000	To be fair, in this scenario, EA has Origin, so that cancels each other out, I suppose.
1181000	1186000	And they also have that stupid thing that you can purchase the service where you can play their games early,
1186000	1190000	and you pay that monthly fee, so they also have that backing them up as well.
1190000	1195000	Which has been, in my opinion, has shot them in the foot this entire year because people are figuring this shit out because of that.
1195000	1202000	Well, they're shoehorning this shit in all these games to either make them long, look at, even Need for Speed has this shit.
1202000	1211000	Well, let me point out from SSG100Matt, EA has taken notice that their EA Sports games have made a boatload of money through their Ultimate Team mode in Madden, FIFA, and NHL games.
1211000	1213000	That mode is pretty much pay-to-win in the game.
1213000	1218000	EA has made more money in that game's loot boxes or cards than with the sale of the actual game.
1218000	1221000	EA has seen this and wants to incorporate it in all their games.
1221000	1227000	So, but, well, but now here's, has the ice broken on this?
1227000	1230000	I mean, will there be an effect of this pushback?
1230000	1236000	And like, I even know people on Twitter who I would consider more casual gamers, but they're into Star Wars.
1236000	1240000	I'm thinking of one friend of mine specifically, one of my old college buddies, was tweeting,
1240000	1248000	I went into GameStop to cancel my pre-order for Battlefront 2 and referenced specifically the Ars Technica review.
1248000	1250000	That basically was like, nope, nope, nope, nope.
1250000	1258000	So he, he cancelled his pre-order and he said that the folks at GameStop supported him in his decision vocally.
1258000	1263000	So this whole, this whole thing, whether you like it, whether you agree with it or not,
1263000	1273000	I think it's safe to say that this whole thing has backfired spectacularly with a game, you know, that is really important to EA right now.
1273000	1280000	And so EA has had to go full circle, full stop and basically, you know, take out the loot boxes at least for now or whatever they're doing.
1280000	1281000	We don't know what they're doing.
1281000	1284000	They've put out a statement that said the microtransactions are disabled.
1284000	1286000	We've heard the player feedback.
1286000	1288000	You just can't buy currency right now.
1288000	1289000	Right.
1289000	1290000	But they're going to enable it later.
1290000	1297000	Well, I would think what's going to happen, and this is just, you know, me speculating, I have nothing to base this on,
1297000	1306000	but EA is going to have to dial it back to cosmetics in the loot boxes and the currency because that's what works for Overwatch.
1306000	1308000	That's what works for a lot of the games that are out there now.
1308000	1315000	And they're going to have to put those unlockable characters and those things that give the in-game advantages like the ship speed and whatever, whatever those other things are.
1315000	1319000	Those are going to have to be some type of earned in-game currency or something else.
1319000	1320000	They're going to have to dial that back to.
1320000	1327000	So I would fully expect that that the loot or excuse me, the EA thing will come back with two currencies.
1327000	1328000	I don't think it will.
1328000	1332000	I think all it's going to do is after some time, they're going to put them, enable them back in.
1332000	1334000	After it, you've already purchased the game.
1334000	1336000	You can't return anymore.
1336000	1337000	They're going to bring it back in.
1337000	1338000	So we will, we've evaluated and everything.
1338000	1339000	We balanced it.
1339000	1343000	They may tweak some of the values or whatever and then leave it as that.
1343000	1348000	And they're going to put it in there because they want, they want money.
1348000	1353000	They're going to say they justify it because they need to put out these additional maps or whatever that they're developing.
1353000	1355000	Honestly, here's, here's my problem.
1355000	1357000	And I don't like people to excuse this crap.
1357000	1364000	Whatever reason, Bobby, if he wants to say it's because they need money for development, other people, because they say it's only for cosmetics, you give them a fucking inch.
1364000	1365000	They're going to take it all.
1365000	1367000	And so this is what we have.
1367000	1370000	We've excused this ship for cosmetics now.
1370000	1371000	And look where it's gotten.
1371000	1372000	Look at where it's gotten now.
1372000	1376000	It's just like these companies have been hell bent on doing this stuff.
1376000	1386000	Like whether it's like driving a franchise into the ground by releasing tons of games in their Activision or by trying to do online passes, EA.
1386000	1387000	But has it, Loki?
1387000	1388000	That's the whole point, I think.
1388000	1393000	Your, your argument, one, this is what's happened.
1393000	1394000	This is what's happened.
1394000	1405000	The, the, the, this is EA has failed this spectacularly on a, on a USA Today level stage where now everybody is reporting on this.
1405000	1408000	I mean, this is this, this is the end game for that, right?
1408000	1409000	No, it's not.
1409000	1411000	It's going to get worse.
1411000	1417000	So you think even though EA has failed on this level and has had to dial this back, we're still going to get more of this?
1417000	1421000	Yeah, it, I think this is, people are going to buy this game.
1421000	1430000	They're going to buy this game because, oh, you know, they're going to forgive them because it's Star Wars or there's going to be some shiny game down the road that they're going to want to buy.
1430000	1436000	I think Red Dead Redemption could be a good indicator because Red Dead is going to definitely have some sort of online mode.
1436000	1438000	It's definitely going to have some sort of microtransactions in there.
1438000	1440000	They've already said they're going to do that.
1440000	1442000	That's a game that a lot of people can't resist.
1442000	1446000	I can't resist that game because it's fucking Red Dead and I will buy it.
1446000	1451000	But that's the problem is like we're, they're going to find something that you want.
1451000	1457000	They're going to tweak it to find something that you want and then you're going to buy it and you're going to get stuck in this and the whole cycle is going to continue.
1457000	1459000	So all they're doing, they're not getting rid of it.
1459000	1461000	They're just tweaking their game of it.
1461000	1463000	All right, let's get to some comments in chat.
1463000	1464000	Dungeon Buster says it will be back.
1464000	1472000	EA will lick its wounds and take baby steps such as when Ubisoft experienced its own backlash years ago as with AC Unity and its own push with Helix.
1472000	1476000	Come on, Noel Gus says they just need to get out of the doghouse with Disney.
1476000	1480000	S. Jonah and Matt says loot boxes are sadly the present of multiplayer games.
1480000	1485000	Dungeon Buster says other companies are looking at EA and taking notes on what not to do.
1485000	1492000	And Bobby says to Loki's point, Bethesda failed horribly with Horse Armor DLC.
1492000	1494000	That was the first time DLC was introduced.
1494000	1496000	DLC is commonplace now.
1496000	1499000	And look at what Bethesda is doing now with their paid mods.
1499000	1500000	Thank you, Bethesda.
1500000	1502000	And they still haven't learned from their fucking lessons.
1502000	1507000	Look, I just kind of think like it's not that I totally disagree with what you guys are saying.
1507000	1511000	I think loot box kind of has to figure out where it fits in in this whole thing.
1511000	1523000	But I think at the end of the day, if you vote with your wallet, as clearly people did in this situation with canceled preorders and so forth and that type of negative press that got all the way to Bob Iger's eyes.
1523000	1526000	If you vote with your wallet, change is going to happen.
1527000	1529000	But enough people need to do that.
1529000	1532000	And that's hopefully what's going to happen this time.
1532000	1533000	I don't think so.
1533000	1536000	I think enough people are going to buy it where it's not going to make a difference.
1536000	1543000	So let me ask this because I think there's one other quote unquote solution we have to explore and I have to throw it out there.
1543000	1547000	And I kind of already think I know what you're going to say, but I'm going to throw it out there for the chat for everybody else.
1547000	1555000	One solution to this problem could be let's just allow companies to charge $70 for the games instead of 60 now.
1555000	1556000	Let's just do that now.
1556000	1558000	No one's saying they can't do that.
1558000	1560000	It's just they would be suicide for their game if they did that.
1560000	1564000	So they have to hide it in different in preorder bonuses and golden.
1564000	1565000	Wait, let me talk about why.
1565000	1569000	Because I actually I'm surprised because I actually kind of agree with you.
1569000	1577000	I'm not against companies raising the price of the game to $70, but because the expectation is going to be that it's going to be better than the other $60 games.
1577000	1579000	And that's not it's not going to be the case.
1579000	1581000	And then there's nothing no reason they can't do that.
1581000	1583000	But they already are doing it.
1583000	1586000	Don't think for one second you're paying $60 for a game.
1586000	1589000	You haven't paid $60 for a game for years now.
1589000	1592000	You've been buying their fucking DLC passes and all this shit.
1592000	1596000	So you've been paying that additional money for the gold editions and stuff.
1596000	1598000	Wait, what I'm going to do to you.
1598000	1600000	I paid 60 bucks for Mario Odyssey.
1600000	1604000	That's been my best gaming experience all year and I haven't paid a penny more.
1604000	1605000	Good.
1605000	1607000	You have one game that you did that for.
1607000	1609000	Good for you.
1609000	1611000	How many amiibos did you buy?
1611000	1612000	How many amiibos have you bought?
1612000	1614000	Yeah, that's DLC too.
1614000	1615000	Your old pal Nintendo.
1615000	1618000	So did you buy an amiibo to dress up Mario in a special costume?
1618000	1621000	Did you do that? Because I believe that's DLC.
1621000	1624000	I got a physical figure with that too.
1624000	1626000	And Mario's never looked better.
1626000	1628000	I'm just saying.
1628000	1631000	Alright, you got me there.
1631000	1633000	You got me bitch.
1633000	1635000	But they're clever for doing that.
1635000	1637000	Because at least you got something that you can justify.
1637000	1640000	Okay, this is worth my money because of this reason.
1640000	1642000	Alright, I got Loki to concede like an inch.
1642000	1643000	So I'll take it.
1643000	1645000	I'm not saying it's wrong.
1645000	1646000	This is the problem.
1646000	1649000	I don't have a problem with these companies doing these things.
1649000	1652000	My problem is they fuck shit up.
1652000	1655000	Like you have a perfectly good game.
1655000	1659000	And then they just get greedy and then they fuck it up because of the greed.
1659000	1662000	Like look at the Shadow of War.
1662000	1663000	Perfect example.
1663000	1665000	It's like the whole Nemesis system and stuff is awesome.
1665000	1669000	And then they cheapen the whole thing by adding this loot box system in there
1669000	1672000	that doesn't need to be in there other than giving them more money.
1672000	1673000	How about this?
1673000	1680000	If it's not financially feasible to release a game like X, then don't do it.
1680000	1682000	Here's my take.
1682000	1687000	Again, I'm not opposed to them raising the cost to $70.
1687000	1691000	However, where I think companies are going to struggle with this
1691000	1694000	is that they're going to have to justify a $70 cost for the game.
1694000	1697000	And that's kind of where I agree with you is that that better be worth it.
1697000	1703000	And the game is going to have to be something of that caliber that makes it worth the $70.
1703000	1705000	Because if they don't, here's the other side of this.
1705000	1707000	Sure, games can release for $70.
1707000	1709000	Games can release for $60.
1709000	1712000	But we all know in the back of our head, and this has been true for how long,
1712000	1718000	we all know in the back of our head they're only going to be $60, $70 for a few months.
1718000	1719000	And then they go on sale.
1719000	1721000	Here comes the Steam sale.
1721000	1724000	Here comes the Black Friday sale.
1724000	1728000	There's so many of us that sit there and go, hmm, I'm not going to buy that game at $60.
1728000	1731000	But eventually, eh, it'll come down to $30.
1731000	1735000	And that's where, to the credit of the developers, the loot box thing is doing them well
1735000	1738000	because even though they have to end up slashing the price of the game,
1738000	1741000	those loot boxes never go on sale.
1741000	1745000	So they still make the same amount of money from that stuff with a whole new player base.
1745000	1749000	Right, but if I'm paying $30 for a game and they have loot boxes in it,
1749000	1753000	I might be more inclined to spend money on loot boxes than I would if I'm paying $60 for a game.
1753000	1754000	Interesting.
1754000	1757000	Because it's just like, okay, well, you're making your money from the loot boxes.
1757000	1764000	This is a very tricky question because if I were to say, what is the price of a video game?
1764000	1766000	Would you just say, no matter what, $60?
1766000	1768000	No, it's whatever the game's worth.
1768000	1770000	I mean, here's the thing.
1770000	1773000	The AAA industry can be as shitty as they want.
1773000	1775000	But in the end, they're not the only industry.
1775000	1778000	There's also the indie industry that's out there as well.
1778000	1780000	And you have indie games that make it big.
1780000	1781000	Look at PUBG.
1781000	1785000	They have loot boxes in there as well, so they're not exempt from that.
1785000	1787000	But, I mean...
1787000	1788000	It's also, what, $30?
1788000	1790000	It's a $40 game.
1790000	1792000	It's insanely popular.
1792000	1798000	And it's a game I think would be popular longer than Star Wars Battlefront II.
1798000	1801000	There's other games out there.
1801000	1805000	So if this industry's being shitty, there's people that are going to be developing games out there
1805000	1809000	that are going to see them like, I'm not going to be a part of that fucking shit.
1809000	1813000	I'm going to release a game for $30 or whatever, and it's going to be a good game.
1813000	1822000	Because you have a lot of analysts and investors saying that this is the only type of game that's going to make money.
1822000	1824000	And they're doing it to please their investors.
1824000	1825000	They have to.
1825000	1828000	And so their investors want as much return as possible.
1828000	1832000	And that's why they're trying to make as much money as possible, which anybody's trying to do.
1832000	1839000	But at the same time, I feel that they're sacrificing quality in order to monetize in ridiculous ways.
1839000	1845000	And a lot of the things that we used to get included as part of the full package of a game is now being nickeled in time.
1845000	1850000	EA is always this purveyor of shitty services.
1850000	1857000	So EA, for example, one of the earliest things I remembered is they had the Godfather game.
1857000	1862000	It came out on PlayStation 2, Xbox, and also Xbox 360 and stuff like that.
1862000	1866000	PlayStation 2 and Xbox, cheat codes.
1866000	1868000	Xbox 360, PlayStation 3.
1868000	1875000	Those cheat codes are DLC that you have to pay for because they can make an extra buck off of it.
1875000	1877000	Cheat codes have all but disappeared from our industry.
1877000	1882000	So it's all these tests to see what they can get away with and what they can charge for and what money can.
1882000	1884000	And if it's successful, then they're going to keep doing it.
1884000	1889000	If it's not successful, they're going to tweak it and pivot on it and see what other ways they can make money.
1889000	1894000	So Bobby Black Wolf, in response to the indie thing mentioned in our chat,
1894000	1898000	most people don't want to play a pixelated farm simulator, which is kind of an indie game.
1898000	1905000	If a casual person buys a 4K gaming system, they're not going to want to play a pixelated indie thing on it.
1905000	1907000	Let me ask this question.
1907000	1913000	What if the game costs $60, but if you wanted 4K graphics to help pay for those artists
1913000	1920000	and up the costs and everything, how about you have to buy a 4K texture pack for 15 bucks?
1920000	1926000	Do you think that would get this EA hate levels of tweet, or do you think that's a reasonable compromise?
1926000	1934000	No, it's not. And the reason why is that you basically just killed the Xbox One X and PlayStation 4 Plus.
1934000	1938000	Because the game essentially costs more on those systems?
1938000	1942000	Well, those systems could play the regular game. You just wouldn't get 4K without 15 bucks.
1942000	1951000	It's not. You can't do that. I don't know. It's shitty. We'll just have to see what happens.
1951000	1955000	I mean, that's all we can do. I don't intend it. I don't think that...
1955000	1962000	Nothing in the history of EA has ever said, oh, we've learned our lesson and we're not going to be shitty anymore.
1962000	1966000	It's, oh, we've learned our lesson, we can't be shitty this way, we're going to have to find another way to be shitty.
1966000	1971000	And that's how it is. And that's the constant battle that we have to deal with with these publishers.
1971000	1980000	So that's what we're going to deal with once again. It's going to be, if this doesn't work out, they'll go away and something else will take its place.
1980000	1986000	It's what happened with the online passes. Whoa, we got to fight that used game industry, man. They are putting us out of business.
1986000	1992000	What is it? The game industry? Is it the fact that games are costing more? It's not making any fucking sense. Is it piracy?
1992000	1995000	You're going to blame piracy again, isn't it? It's just...
1996000	2005000	It is interesting to me that that whole issue seems to have been solved by the fact that a lot of these companies are convincing people to buy their games digitally.
2005000	2011000	And you can't really resell a digital game. So that kind of worked out, didn't it?
2011000	2022000	Well, it also doesn't help that games, it's a hassle to do that. And it's a lot of times, like, it's fun to have that large library of games because now they're giving you all these free games and stuff.
2022000	2029000	But it doesn't really bother me that I can't sell the game back anymore because I end up playing it, I may play it down the road later on or something like that.
2029000	2038000	It doesn't take up any space in my house, so it's not a big deal. It's just out there in the cloud digitally somewhere and I can always redownload it later on until they shut down whatever service it is.
2039000	2045000	But so that doesn't really bother me. I never thought I would be buying games mostly digitally, but I am.
2045000	2056000	But yes, that would stop used sales a bit. But I don't think that was really a big deal in the first place. It was just an excuse.
2056000	2062000	This is why they wanted to blame Redbox for the fact that their games weren't selling. No, it's not the case.
2063000	2070000	To me, the used game thing kind of is in that same bucket with if your game is worth $60, people buy the $60 to get it new, or they just wait for it to go on sale.
2070000	2075000	And the used game kind of falls in that bucket where they'll wait to buy the used.
2075000	2077000	Or make your game so that it's fully-
2077000	2080000	But if the game is really good, you can't find a used copy anywhere because people don't sell it.
2080000	2087000	Or just make sure your game is good when it comes out and not fucking buggy as shit so you have to patch it later on because a lot of games get rushed out.
2088000	2094000	And that's another reason people wait is because they're like, fuck that, I'm not buying Assassin's Creed, that's going to be buggy as shit.
2094000	2097000	I won't wait until they patch that shit, and they'll buy it later.
2097000	2103000	One more question I have, and then I swear we're going to move on because we need to get off this topic because it's been consuming everything for a couple weeks.
2103000	2105000	And there's a lot of other things to talk about.
2105000	2109000	But one more question. And I kind of feel like you're already going to say no.
2109000	2118000	But do you think that there will be any fallout at EA's executive level for what's happened this year?
2118000	2122000	With Star Wars being at the forefront of that, Mass Effect to a lesser extent.
2122000	2132000	Because from my perspective, I'm sitting here as somebody who is a Mass Effect fan, looking at Bioware having to take the hit for what happened with Mass Effect.
2132000	2136000	DICE having to take the hit, because that apology came from DICE, it didn't come from EA.
2136000	2142000	And I'm kind of sitting here going, when's EA's board going to take some fucking ownership here?
2142000	2147000	So my question is, is anybody at EA going to have to take a hit for what's happened this year?
2147000	2149000	No, because this is all part of their calculation.
2149000	2155000	They're just basically saying, okay, right now we're going to take a hit now, but we're going to make it up on the back end when we reintroduce this stuff.
2155000	2159000	And we're going to spice it up somehow, we're going to introduce new characters.
2160000	2168000	Because right now, when people are calculating how long it's going to take to grind these different characters, it was based off of what is currently in existence.
2168000	2173000	Who says that that's all that there's going to be? They're going to add characters to that.
2173000	2181000	So I don't think it's going to be, and they've even said in their investor meetings or calls or whatever, that it's not going to affect anything.
2181000	2183000	At least that's what they're saying right now.
2184000	2194000	And I'm worried that, yeah, that's probably going to be the case, because people will buy the game eventually, and they'll forgive them and forget, and then the next game will come out, and this whole shit will happen again.
2194000	2197000	What was the other thing I was going to say?
2197000	2204000	So speaking of EA as a publisher, you may know that there's slim margins in video games and game stores.
2204000	2209000	Guess who charges the most for their games out of all of the AAA publishers?
2209000	2216000	That's right, it's EA. They charge a $1.25 a piece extra over most of the other companies out there.
2216000	2217000	Interesting.
2217000	2220000	Take-Two is also another one that charges a good amount.
2220000	2223000	But the Take-Two's games always sell like banana bonkers.
2223000	2224000	They do.
2224000	2225000	So that's how they do it.
2225000	2226000	Activision.
2226000	2229000	Look at Star Wars, the movie, going into movie theaters.
2229000	2236000	The demands from Disney to the movie theaters for playing Episode VIII are huge.
2236000	2243000	Like, a read about that out there is that there's some smaller theaters in some smaller markets that are refusing to play it, because they're not going to play by Disney's rules.
2243000	2244000	So that's interesting.
2244000	2247000	Well, Disney's a whole other...
2247000	2250000	Talk about evil organizations, I mean, jeez.
2250000	2254000	Well, I mean, they're kind of a part of this too, in a way.
2255000	2258000	They may have been the one to ultimately end or stop what's going on here.
2258000	2261000	But anyway, let's move on. We've got a lot to talk about.
2261000	2264000	So, let's see. Other stuff I want to get into.
2264000	2266000	I do want to get into our gaming week.
2266000	2272000	But before we get into our gaming week, I should acknowledge that we are taping our show today on 19 November.
2272000	2278000	Which is somewhat of a, and I'm going to use my quotey fingers, holiday for enthusiasts of music games.
2278000	2281000	Specifically, Konami's Bomani music series.
2281000	2291000	Which really, you know, is what we owe the fact, because it's how Yuumi, Dark Sakura, how the three of us all met, and really formed OLR, was because we always used to play Dance Dance Revolution at Golf Land.
2291000	2300000	And, if you didn't know, the reason why it's 19 November or 20 November is that 20 November was a song that was in the very first, I think, BeatMania game.
2300000	2304000	They crossed over, they did like a dance remix that was in Dance Dance Revolution.
2304000	2312000	And then somewhere along the way around, like BeatMania 6 style 2DX, they had a 19 November, which I guess is a prequel.
2312000	2317000	I don't know what you want to call it, but it's basically like another song that has a very specific call out date in it.
2317000	2327000	So that's why a lot of Bomani enthusiasts celebrate, and I'm using my quotey fingers, 19 November and 20 November is kind of like the official Bomani weekend or what have you.
2327000	2333000	So, I'm just curious, when was the last time you, like, played a game out of that series?
2333000	2341000	I actually got to play pop and music this last weekend. I was in San Francisco, I went to a show yesterday, actually Dark Sakura met me there, which was really cool.
2341000	2347000	But we actually went to, I went to Japantown, and they have that little arcade there, and they have two pop and music machines.
2347000	2353000	So I was actually able to play pop and music yesterday, which was funny because I failed spectacularly on the first song.
2353000	2357000	Because I was like, oh, I think I can play songs about this level, and I did terrible.
2357000	2364000	And then I dropped it down just a little bit, and it was like, oh, okay, it's like slowly coming back to me, and I can play the nine button pop and music.
2364000	2371000	Which is, if you don't know what pop and music is, it's a music game, but imagine the game of trouble with the pop-o-matic bubble, that big bubble you hit.
2371000	2377000	Imagine there's nine of those in a line, or in a staggered line, and that's what you use to control the game.
2377000	2382000	And it's really a lot of fun to watch, because it looks ridiculous, but it's a lot of fun.
2382000	2384000	And what was the last time you touched any of that stuff?
2384000	2393000	I don't remember. Last time I played, I think, I remember playing DDR at one of my son's birthday parties that he went to.
2393000	2398000	And that was painful.
2401000	2403000	It's hard to play DDR now.
2404000	2405000	It's not in shape anymore.
2406000	2414000	Looking in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Dark Tetsuya points out that 20 November is also DJ Nagarayo, who is the composer of that, as his birthday.
2414000	2416000	So, that was the tie-in for that.
2417000	2418000	So, there you go.
2418000	2420000	So, 19 November is pre-game day or something like that.
2420000	2422000	Yeah, is it birthday eve?
2422000	2423000	Birthday eve.
2424000	2428000	Alright, maybe that was good, because Good Cool did not, maybe Good Cool's birthday was 19 November, I don't know.
2428000	2429000	Alright, anyway.
2430000	2432000	So, I just wanted to give a shout-out and acknowledge that.
2432000	2436000	Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.
2436000	2437000	Loki, what have you been up to?
2437000	2439000	So, I haven't played a whole ton of stuff.
2439000	2445000	I almost bought Skyrim VR, but then I was like, it's $60 and it's Skyrim again.
2445000	2447000	How many times am I going to buy this game?
2447000	2451000	So, I haven't purchased it yet, and I'm probably going to hold off.
2451000	2460000	I may get it on PC if I ever get a VR headset for PC that's of any, you know, if it's decent or whatever.
2463000	2473000	But, I have been playing LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2, and I mainly just unlock characters for my kids so that they can play the free mode and stuff like that whenever I finish the game.
2475000	2478000	Honestly, I'm kind of getting bored of these games.
2478000	2486000	They used to have a funny storyline and good voice acting and stuff, and it seems like the voice acting has really gone downhill since the first one.
2486000	2489000	Like, the first one had some really great voice actors in there.
2489000	2493000	Now, it's like they've changed all the voices out again.
2493000	2496000	I don't really like it the way that they've kind of done it.
2496000	2499000	And the humor is kind of just, eh, it's alright.
2499000	2507000	The one thing that's positive about it is they've kind of increased the number of boss fights that are in there, and there are some pretty interesting boss fights.
2507000	2512000	The problem also with that, though, is it's a game definitely geared towards kids.
2512000	2519000	So the bosses, you can really see, they basically highlight projecting where the boss is going to attack next.
2519000	2524000	And there's really no difficulty to it anyways, because if you die, you just keep respawning.
2524000	2530000	You just lose the studs in the game, which is kind of like the in-game currency to unlock characters.
2530000	2533000	Although, the characters I have already are already unlocked.
2533000	2537000	But later on, you get characters and you have to unlock them with studs that you collect in the game.
2537000	2549000	But the storyline's alright. I mean, they've kind of focused it around the Guardians of the Galaxy, but then now it's kind of getting more into just comic book stuff.
2549000	2553000	Like, they have Kang the Conqueror is the big villain in the game.
2553000	2557000	And I'm not too familiar with him, aside from one of the books that my kids have.
2558000	2564000	There's a story in this Marvel book that I read to them that has Kang the Conqueror in it, and he's this time traveler guy.
2564000	2568000	Apparently he has a giant sword-shaped ship or something.
2568000	2574000	But then there's this weird time travel shit, and there's all these characters in Marvel Universe. I have no fucking clue who they are.
2574000	2577000	But the puzzles are just getting very easy, and it's just... I don't know.
2577000	2581000	It's not as entertaining as it was before. Now, they've played through several of these games.
2581000	2591000	It just kind of gets very formulaic, like, okay, I know what to do now. There's no puzzle solving or actual difficult fights.
2591000	2600000	It's just trudging through it. The other day I was literally falling asleep playing the game, and somehow I beat the boss because I was falling asleep.
2600000	2603000	I was just hitting the button, and I was like, ah, I'm just going to keep punching him.
2603000	2609000	It didn't matter because if I died, I'd just respawn and keep punching him. There's no penalty for that.
2609000	2615000	Which is fine. That's for kids. I get it. But it would be nice if adults do play these games, too.
2615000	2619000	It would be kind of cool if they kind of catered it a little bit towards everybody.
2619000	2625000	You just don't dumb it down because it's just kids you're playing. You can have a kid mode in there or something like that.
2626000	2638000	What else? Actually, aside from that, I was playing also Lego Batman 2 DC Super Heroes.
2638000	2642000	That one's actually an older game, but I've been playing that on my PC, and that one's all right.
2642000	2649000	But, you know, at least that one's sort of funny, and the voice acting is much better because it's one of the earlier games.
2649000	2655000	So they have the Batman TV series of voice actors and stuff like that, so that's kind of cool.
2655000	2659000	Aside from Batman, I still have a lot of VR games I've been meaning to play.
2659000	2666000	I just haven't gotten around to it because my wife's been hogging the TV with friends, and so it would be very difficult for me to set up.
2666000	2674000	Usually I set up one of our dining room chairs to sit on so that the camera can pick the move controllers up very well.
2674000	2680000	Our couch is just outside of the good area for detection of that stuff.
2680000	2682000	You can't just turn the camera a little bit and fix that?
2682000	2686000	I'd have to move it forward. I don't know. It's really silly.
2686000	2694000	So I just haven't been able to do that yet. I've got like four or five games, PlayStation VR games, that I need to get into.
2694000	2698000	So I'm hoping over the break I'll get to actually do that.
2699000	2705000	And then I've been putting off getting South Park. I may get that at some point because it looks good.
2705000	2711000	And I do want Skyrim VR. We'll see how well I can hold out.
2711000	2717000	It's Skyrim. I've played so many hours in it. I don't want to start all over again.
2718000	2723000	I don't know. They have to really add something new to it. That's what I wanted to do on PC. Mods.
2724000	2729000	Kai, should I also suggest for your camera usage, get a tripod. It fixes a lot of that stuff.
2729000	2733000	Well, it's just sitting on top of the TV. I don't know if it really needs the tripod.
2733000	2738000	But once again, if I did all that, it'd be in front of the TV. Wife can't watch TV.
2738000	2742000	And then she'll be bored and then I'll have to hear about it and I don't want to hear about it.
2742000	2743000	Repeatedly.
2743000	2750000	It's like you have Netflix. You can watch it on your computer because that's what I do if I want to watch something.
2750000	2752000	No. No.
2752000	2758000	Alright. My gaming week. Not a lot of new stuff this week because I'm continuing to play Mario Odyssey.
2758000	2762000	That was a great thing to play on the plane. I actually brought my Switch and was playing it on the plane.
2762000	2771000	My son keeps bugging me to get a Switch and get Mario Odyssey. It's $400. I can't spend $400 for Mario Odyssey right now.
2771000	2774000	Well, hopefully the system will come down.
2774000	2780000	Yes, I need a man cave. We have very few. We have one bathroom.
2780000	2783000	A response to our comment live.
2783000	2790000	I do need a man cave. I have the garage but it smells like cat box and it's cold or super hot.
2790000	2795000	I've also been playing Heroes of the Storm. I'm still going on that plane regularly.
2795000	2802000	My cell phone gaming. My AR gaming between Ingress and Pokemon Go because Ingress has double AP right now which is a big deal.
2802000	2807000	By the way, Loki, if you haven't signed in, make sure you sign in and get the free thing in the store because it's a free key locker and it's a bonus.
2807000	2809000	So now you can have six key lockers.
2809000	2811000	Hooray! I will do that now.
2811000	2816000	Even if you don't plan on playing regularly, you'll kick yourself if you don't grab that while you can.
2816000	2827000	Or for anybody out there who plays it, if you haven't played in a while, go in their currency because you get a free pack for the anniversary that has one fracker, one beacon, and a new key capsule that's like a black and red pattern.
2827000	2830000	So yeah, check that out.
2830000	2834000	So with double AP, I've been playing a little bit more of that, though not a ton.
2834000	2841000	You haven't heard about the whole other twist. They did another twist in Ingress where one player now can deploy only for this anniversary event.
2841000	2847000	One player can deploy 8, 8, 7, 7 on a portal as opposed to 1, 8, and 1, 7.
2847000	2855000	And I know people that don't follow Ingress may not understand that but basically it allows you to make a portal of a higher level, a level 6 portal, by yourself.
2856000	2860000	And it only takes 4 people, as opposed to 8 people, to make the highest level portal.
2860000	2865000	So there's more level 8 portals popping up all over the place, which is kind of fun.
2865000	2867000	So anyway, that's in short what's happening in Ingress.
2867000	2871000	Pokemon Go, I know we're going to get to it a little bit later, but they just announced another event today.
2871000	2875000	And I don't know if I mentioned this on the show, but I had a Pokemon Go Plus.
2875000	2880000	And it was working fine, but it was having issues on iOS 11 that I was reading about online.
2880000	2883000	And I got to play with Alan, has this thing called a Gotcha.
2883000	2885000	I think I did mention this on the show.
2885000	2887000	Yeah, it's basically the thing I was saying.
2887000	2891000	John from Critical Myth actually tagged me on Facebook saying he got one because he heard me talking about it.
2891000	2899000	And I got to say, the Gotcha, even though it's very third party or what have you, it does work really well.
2899000	2904000	I mean, some people might think, well, isn't the thrill gone if that thing catches everything for you?
2904000	2906000	And my answer is yes and no.
2906000	2916000	If I want to incentivize my walking, the Gotcha is very good for that because I get stats on my egg and so forth and so forth.
2916000	2923000	But if I want to catch certain Pokemon or go to a farm part of town or something where we know a certain Pokemon spawns,
2923000	2926000	I don't think the Gotcha or the Pokemon Go Plus or any of that is very good for it.
2926000	2931000	You do want to play the game in your hand and actually manually do the catches because with these devices,
2931000	2935000	you throw one ball at the Pokemon and either you catch it or you don't.
2935000	2940000	So the Gotcha or the Pokemon Go Plus, it's great for catching Pidgeys and Spinaraks and shit that's everywhere,
2940000	2945000	but it's not going to help you catch stuff that's a little more rare.
2945000	2948000	So I wouldn't really use it for those types of scenarios.
2948000	2952000	But anyway, so I've been using that to play a little more of that.
2952000	2954000	And then here's the storm.
2954000	2959000	Diablo with the new season that just started.
2959000	2964000	And I reupped my subscription to World of Warcraft.
2964000	2967000	I thought, oh, let's see what's been going on in there.
2967000	2971000	It's been a long time since I played, so I haven't quit 14 or anything.
2971000	2975000	It's just kind of a lull right now on 14 and not really a lot of content.
2975000	2981000	Not a lot of people that I know have been playing lately, so there hasn't been a whole lot of people to be doing stuff with.
2981000	2987000	But I'm keeping it open just because if somebody does say like, hey, Rob, let's go do a dungeon, I can do that.
2987000	2991000	But I'm kind of flirting with WoW a little bit, just kind of seeing what's changed and what's different.
2991000	2992000	So there's that.
2992000	2993000	I guess we all knew it would happen eventually.
2993000	2995000	This tends to happen once a year, by the way.
2995000	2998000	I'll reup WoW for a month, maybe two, and then I'll cancel it.
2998000	3005000	So that'll probably be what happens here again, but it's my annual revisit to that game.
3005000	3009000	So that's pretty much it for my gaming week.
3009000	3017000	Before we get into news this week, I should announce here on the show because this little thing is at my feet right now.
3018000	3024000	So you guys know that Alan and I had a kitty that Sanrio passed away a few weeks ago.
3024000	3026000	It was probably close to a month now.
3026000	3031000	And obviously we've been really wanting to get a new cat just because even though our old cats can never be...
3031000	3035000	I say cats because we had another one, Maruko, a few years ago, and he passed.
3035000	3040000	But even though we can never replace those cats, we knew we had to get something.
3040000	3042000	We had to get a new little furball friend.
3042000	3045000	So we actually have a new kitty.
3045000	3052000	And he doesn't have a name yet, but I keep calling him Mr. Smoosh just because he has a little smooshy face.
3052000	3054000	He's one of those cats that has a smooshy face.
3054000	3059000	And Mr. Smoosh is much more social than Sanrio or the other cats were.
3059000	3061000	So he's actually out here in the studio right now just chilling.
3061000	3064000	He was napping up on the couch earlier and Loki...
3064000	3066000	His face kind of looks like Yoda.
3066000	3068000	Does it?
3068000	3069000	A little bit.
3069000	3073000	There's pictures on my Twitter at Skye, S-K-I-E, if you want to see pictures here.
3073000	3075000	But, oh, he's great.
3075000	3080000	And so the interesting thing is usually you don't find smooshfoot face cats as rescues.
3080000	3083000	They're usually cats that you breed, right?
3083000	3088000	And we're very big... Al and I are very big on we only want to do rescue cats because we want to help cats at home.
3088000	3095000	But a friend on Facebook posted about this cat that her friend had found, I guess this cat...
3095000	3097000	Somebody abandoned this cat in the apartment complex.
3097000	3100000	And the cat was just kind of walking around outside for a couple weeks.
3100000	3103000	So somebody took him in, tried taking him to the vet.
3103000	3106000	They read the chip. The numbers on the chip were disconnected.
3106000	3110000	So they can't get in touch with whoever owned and left this cat.
3110000	3113000	I worry somebody moved out in that apartment complex and left the cat there.
3113000	3116000	Because you know how people do that sometimes, which is really shitty.
3116000	3119000	But we kind of think that's probably what happened with this cat.
3119000	3122000	So it ended up being that we could rescue a cat.
3122000	3125000	Who would have abandoned such a beautiful cat?
3125000	3128000	This is like a show cat. I don't understand.
3128000	3130000	But Al and I are going to take real good care of him.
3130000	3133000	And we'll pick a long-term name at some point.
3133000	3135000	Although I have a feeling this Mr. Smoosh is going to stay.
3135000	3139000	I'm surprised they didn't have the name on the chip. Sometimes they put the name on the chip itself.
3139000	3140000	Yeah, we didn't hear anything about that.
3140000	3142000	We're going to take it into our vet and have the chip read again.
3142000	3144000	If the chip is still in there, I imagine it is.
3144000	3149000	We're going to have the chip read again just to make sure everything is being accounted for.
3149000	3152000	And then if there is a name on there, then we'll decide.
3152000	3154000	It's kind of up to us if we want to keep it or not.
3154000	3160000	Right, yeah. Because I know when I registered our cat, we had to put the name on there.
3160000	3164000	So I think it had it. But maybe, I don't know.
3164000	3171000	Dark Tetsuya in chat says, listless name the cat. Hell no.
3171000	3174000	That is a big hell no.
3174000	3176000	I love the idea though. That's great.
3176000	3178000	Alright, so anyhow.
3178000	3182000	So Mr. Smoosh is now the unofficial co-host of our show.
3182000	3185000	You want to come say hello? He's not very talkative.
3185000	3190000	He's only talkative when he whines and wants food.
3190000	3192000	Anyway, alright.
3192000	3194000	No, I don't think Mr. Smoosh is going to talk.
3194000	3195000	You want to say something Mr. Smoosh?
3195000	3198000	He's rubbing up on the microphone.
3198000	3202000	I think with the voice card though, it probably isn't coming through.
3202000	3205000	Yeah, he was very vocal earlier when I had chicken in here.
3205000	3207000	He was like, you're going to give me some of that?
3207000	3209000	Leroy.
3209000	3213000	Alright. Anyhow, let's get into some other gaming news.
3213000	3216000	What else is going on in the game industry this week? Loki.
3216000	3219000	It's just all loot boxes, right?
3219000	3222000	I think there is other stuff. Loot boxes is distracting us from everything else.
3222000	3223000	That's all anybody can talk about.
3223000	3225000	It's just so like, I don't know.
3225000	3230000	It's been just, if it's not reading about loot box stuff, it's reading about...
3230000	3232000	Let's loot box the news.
3232000	3233000	Loot box the news.
3233000	3236000	That's what we'll do. We're going to put, in the future for the kickoff topic,
3236000	3238000	we're going to put three news articles in boxes,
3238000	3240000	and we're going to open one loot box and see what...
3240000	3244000	I love loot boxes in Borderlands or in Diablo,
3244000	3248000	where they're like in the game, not where I had to purchase them.
3248000	3254000	So anyways, speaking of games, Overwatch.
3254000	3259000	So there's been an issue with Overwatch where accounts are getting suspended
3259000	3264000	and banned due to false reports, I guess.
3264000	3273000	And so one of these situations is actually there was a person playing a match.
3273000	3275000	It was actually...
3275000	3281000	Felix Lengel was playing, I guess, a competitive Overwatch match
3281000	3283000	when he was booted from the game
3283000	3288000	and informed that his account had been banned or suspended.
3288000	3291000	And I guess he was mid-match when that occurred,
3291000	3294000	and so that kind of sucked.
3294000	3298000	Apparently though, this also happened during the Overwatch World Cup
3298000	3304000	when a Canadian player also had that happen as well.
3304000	3308000	So apparently after the ban was issued,
3308000	3312000	he found out that, I guess, the email was saying that
3312000	3318000	there was an offensive misused reporting system or something like that
3318000	3323000	that they had issued it only after careful review of evidence.
3323000	3332000	And the message specified that it referred to other players reporting him
3332000	3334000	that prevented him from playing.
3334000	3339000	And I guess the thing is now people like doing these false reports.
3339000	3342000	At least it's not swatting, so let's step up from that.
3342000	3344000	But it still sucks that people are reporting.
3344000	3347000	I have a feeling they're watching these streams of people playing competitively
3347000	3351000	and saying, aha, we're going to troll that guy by reporting him or something.
3351000	3352000	He's cheating or something.
3352000	3354000	Shouldn't there be some type of backlash
3354000	3357000	where if this gets Blizzard's attention
3357000	3360000	and they can even provide the footage or whatever and the proof,
3360000	3364000	couldn't Blizzard go back and basically make these people
3364000	3367000	unable to report accounts ever again because they abused the system?
3367000	3372000	Maybe. Or can they easily create new Blizzard accounts?
3372000	3375000	Maybe. They'd have to re-buy Overwatch.
3376000	3379000	Well, free play weekend though maybe is, I don't know.
3379000	3381000	Was it a free play weekend?
3381000	3383000	When this happened, I don't think it was.
3383000	3385000	But right now is a free play weekend in Overwatch.
3385000	3388000	I was just thinking like, oh, it would be easy to make new accounts.
3388000	3391000	But I don't know, maybe free players don't get to report
3391000	3398000	or have their reports mean as much as somebody who's a paying customer.
3398000	3400000	I don't know. Blizzard's still having to work all that out
3400000	3404000	and they claim it's taking away from development of the actual game because of it.
3404000	3407000	Woohoo, okay. I mean, I don't feel bad for them.
3407000	3409000	It is a big deal.
3409000	3411000	I'm okay with them taking the time to get this right.
3411000	3413000	You want the community to be positive.
3413000	3415000	And it is a big deal because he is a professional player.
3415000	3419000	He's on one of the Blizzard teams, the Dallas Fuel.
3419000	3424000	Sounds like a Mountain Dew brand or something like that.
3424000	3427000	Dallas Fuel. But whatever the case may be.
3427000	3432000	So he's got his team, at least the people managing that are looking into it as well.
3432000	3435000	I'll try to see if Blizzard can kind of correct that.
3435000	3439000	But it's still shitty that this is going to be a thing.
3439000	3441000	Especially, that's got to hurt too.
3441000	3445000	Like if it's happening, at least this was at home.
3445000	3447000	But like, couldn't the same thing happen?
3447000	3453000	Like say, add a match in an arena or something like that?
3453000	3455000	Or just false reporting these people?
3455000	3457000	I don't know.
3457000	3461000	You would think that there would be some way to figure that out.
3461000	3465000	But how are you going to, without truly investigating these things.
3465000	3468000	I don't know what proof they have.
3468000	3470000	We won't know because only Blizzard can see that.
3470000	3472000	Right.
3472000	3474000	So, I don't know if there's an easy answer to this.
3474000	3478000	But it's probably going to impact the way that you do reporting in one way or another.
3478000	3484000	I guess there's probably not going to be any automated bans when a ton of people report a certain individual.
3484000	3486000	Which actually could end up being a bad thing.
3486000	3490000	Because that could affect people that are spamming or people that really are toxic that do need to go.
3490000	3494000	Either way, they should always have humans looking at that stuff.
3494000	3496000	Yeah. Wherever they can.
3496000	3502000	Alright, well one thing that many humans and gamers in the gaming community are looking at over the next couple weeks is the Game Awards.
3502000	3508000	You know, it's been taking a very long time for somebody to get Game Awards right in this industry.
3508000	3514000	But we do have the nominees out for the Game Awards 2017.
3514000	3522000	And also news that some big reveals and secrets are going to be coming for the Game Awards from a number of developers and publishers.
3522000	3525000	13 plus reveals. I don't know what the plus means.
3525000	3529000	But some of these will be Switch titles, undoubtedly.
3529000	3533000	Nintendo's done a lot with Game Awards before those, so that's not too surprising to hear.
3533000	3540000	Maybe DLC Pack 2 will be part of the announcement, which was supposed to be out in November.
3540000	3543000	But I don't think that's happening at this point because November's almost done.
3543000	3545000	And they still haven't announced anything with this.
3545000	3550000	And I think the Game Awards are what on the... What day is it?
3550000	3555000	Let's see, the Game Awards is December 7th.
3555000	3557000	Okay, there you go. I knew it was like the first week in December.
3557000	3561000	Oh, by the way, speaking of Nintendo, Bobby Blackwolf in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,
3561000	3567000	Animal Crossing Pocket Camp has a release date November 22nd on American App Stores.
3567000	3570000	Oh, thank you for your money. That was something that I was playing.
3570000	3572000	Which is on the Australian store.
3572000	3576000	Yes, I played it. I am bored to death with that game, so I will not be playing it.
3576000	3577000	What's wrong with it?
3577000	3581000	It's just boring. It's Animal Crossing, but boring.
3583000	3585000	You just kind of wore it out? You weren't into it?
3585000	3589000	I'm not even engaged. It's just not engaging enough for me.
3589000	3594000	There's not really any... I don't know. I just don't feel the need to play it.
3594000	3595000	Alright.
3595000	3599000	I don't know, but whatever. I mean, I'm sure other people will like it.
3599000	3602000	I was going to mention, though, there's some of the nominees.
3602000	3607000	I was just about to get to it, too. Game of the Year. That's the only one anybody cares about, right?
3607000	3611000	Game of the Year is Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild. No surprise there.
3611000	3614000	Super Mario Odyssey. No surprise there.
3614000	3617000	PUBG. No surprise there, really.
3617000	3621000	Horizon Zero Dawn. Not a huge surprise.
3621000	3623000	And Persona 5. Also not a huge surprise.
3623000	3629000	So, that list of nominees, pretty much... I mean, you can't really look at any of those games and say those don't deserve to be there.
3629000	3635000	There's no Battlefront 2 or no Call of Duty or no...
3635000	3637000	EA games. No EA games.
3637000	3640000	No Shadow of War?
3640000	3643000	How do you feel about two Nintendo games, Loki?
3643000	3647000	I think they were great games. I don't see a problem with them being on there at all.
3647000	3652000	Like, do we think that I hate Nintendo? Like, I don't understand what the problem is.
3652000	3653000	Sometimes, yes.
3655000	3661000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Andrade with VoGnetwork.com, use the passphrase, call.
3661000	3666000	BlobbyBlackWolf in chat says, PUBG is still in early access.
3666000	3670000	So, you know, I guess maybe some would wonder, does PUBG deserve to be there?
3670000	3678000	That is a little weird, but I mean, it's not like we're talking about Game of the Year being, you know, Nintendo's online.
3678000	3681000	Because that's certainly not going to get voted Game of the Year or anything of the year.
3681000	3684000	You're shifting the conversation away from PUBG.
3684000	3687000	Why is PUBG in the Game of the Year if it's still in early access?
3687000	3692000	Well, I mean, it's hard to deny the effect that game has had on the gaming industry, and I think that's why it's there.
3692000	3695000	You know, that game has basically taken over Twitch.
3695000	3700000	And now we see, even if it is in early access, it already has imitators, right?
3700000	3704000	Why is this a category? Best ongoing game?
3705000	3709000	Oh, like, is that where, like, Overwatch and stuff is nominated for stuff like this?
3709000	3714000	Yeah, like Overwatch and Destiny 2. Yeah, it's ongoing. It just came out, like, two months ago.
3714000	3716000	What, is that, like, an online game?
3716000	3719000	Yeah, Overwatch didn't. Overwatch was the game of the year last year.
3719000	3721000	Oh, right. Overwatch didn't. The rest of the categories make sense.
3721000	3726000	Like Rainbow Six Siege and, you know, Grand Theft Auto Online, that type of stuff, Warframe.
3726000	3732000	I assume they just want to acknowledge developers that have kept supporting their game a long time after release.
3732000	3737000	Well, how congratulations to Bungie for supporting their games two months after launch.
3737000	3741000	Props to them, man. I know that's such a struggle.
3742000	3746000	I do like, they have Best Student Game. That's kind of cool. Trending Gamer.
3746000	3752000	What do you think about the most, I did think it's really cool, they have that guy from Games Done Quick.
3752000	3754000	In the game, he'll win.
3754000	3756000	What, Trending Gamer?
3756000	3760000	Yeah, my money's on Dr. Disrespect, but, you know.
3760000	3762000	Of course it is.
3762000	3766000	Alright, for the record, I don't know that guy. I just, I hear the name.
3767000	3769000	What do you think of this category?
3769000	3772000	Thank you, it's half coordinated was the name I was thinking of. Thank you, Dr. Z.
3772000	3774000	What do you think of this category?
3774000	3776000	Most Anticipated Game.
3776000	3782000	God of War, Spider-Man, Monster Hunter World, Red Dead Redemption 2, and The Last of Us Part 2.
3782000	3784000	What do you think of that category?
3784000	3786000	Brought to you by Sony.
3786000	3788000	I mean...
3788000	3791000	What do you think? Hype. Nothing but hype category.
3791000	3793000	Best Hype.
3793000	3797000	It's a dumb category, but Red Dead 2, all the way.
3797000	3799000	Of course.
3799000	3801000	I'm biased, so...
3801000	3806000	Of those five for game of the year, which do you think will win and should win?
3806000	3808000	Mario Odyssey for both?
3808000	3812000	Okay, I think Breath of the Wild will win.
3812000	3819000	And it really, really not that it shouldn't win, but my vote would go to Mario Odyssey.
3819000	3821000	I think Mario Odyssey for both.
3821000	3824000	The thing that's a little weird about that is that...
3824000	3828000	Will the fact that there's two Nintendo games in there kind of cancel each other out?
3828000	3830000	Like, are they going to split the vote?
3830000	3832000	No, I don't think so.
3832000	3836000	I think Breath of the Wild's been out long enough that people have kind of forgotten about it.
3836000	3839000	To where Mario Odyssey is going to be more fresh in people's minds.
3839000	3843000	I think it's going to get the vote because it's so much nostalgia thrown in there.
3843000	3846000	Whereas Breath of the Wild is like, wow, this is a really new direction for Zelda.
3846000	3853000	This is more like, wow, it's so innovative and fun to play, and all the nostalgia, and oh, it's so colorful and cute.
3853000	3855000	And yeah, everybody's talking about it.
3855000	3858000	Really? I mean, I could just see a scenario where they go out there and they go,
3858000	3860000	It's a tie!
3860000	3863000	And both games win and let the Nintendo orgy begin.
3863000	3868000	It's Horizon Zero Dawn in Persona 5.
3868000	3870000	Alright.
3870000	3872000	Let's move on with some more news. Logi.
3872000	3874000	Yeah, so...
3875000	3881000	Apparently, Disney has dropped out of Marvel Heroes.
3881000	3890000	So, they've cut their ties with Gazillion, and that's caused the online game, Marvel Heroes, to shut down.
3890000	3892000	That's kind of unfortunate.
3892000	3895000	So basically, they had an email that went out that said,
3895000	3901000	We regret to inform our Marvel Heroes fans that we have ended our relationship with Gazillion Entertainment,
3901000	3904000	and that Marvel Heroes games will be shut down.
3904000	3908000	We would like to sincerely thank you, the players who have joined Marvel Heroes community,
3908000	3911000	and will provide any updates as they become available.
3911000	3918000	And of course, that was out on PC, and then they had console ports on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,
3918000	3921000	which I never did play, but I know those are free to play.
3921000	3923000	Oh well, guess I won't be playing that.
3923000	3924000	Of course...
3924000	3927000	I feel like I played this one for a half second.
3927000	3929000	Not a lot of people were happy about that.
3929000	3935000	And some of those include people, once again, that were paying money via microtransactions.
3935000	3941000	So there was a guy that said he'd sunk $400 in the microtransactions, unlocking different characters,
3941000	3947000	and now we're worried that money is all gone, or now the service is going away.
3947000	3949000	I kind of...
3950000	3953000	You know, I don't know if I really excuse that.
3953000	3956000	Yeah, you can be mad about it, and they're demanding refunds,
3956000	3960000	but it's an online game that's free to play.
3960000	3963000	There's no guarantee that things are going to stay around forever.
3963000	3964000	I just, you know...
3964000	3965000	I don't know.
3965000	3966000	It does suck for some people.
3966000	3972000	This one guy, they said Shanancy Flock, he had spent 700 hours playing the game.
3975000	3976000	I don't know.
3976000	3978000	It's just people spending money in these online games.
3978000	3980000	That's how they...
3980000	3983000	They don't charge you money up front, so that's how they pay for these games.
3983000	3984000	So...
3985000	3986000	What...
3986000	3988000	Why do you think you should get your money back?
3990000	3993000	It'd be different if they announced a free-to-play game is launching,
3993000	3997000	and they had you pre-order, you know, Loot Box or something,
3997000	4001000	because I've seen that, where you pre-order TLC, and you pay for that,
4001000	4006000	and then it just fails launch or launches and lasts for a month or something like that.
4006000	4007000	I hate to say it.
4007000	4013000	I mean, it sucks, but at the end of the day, you have to know that when you buy virtual shit,
4013000	4016000	that virtual shit could get the plug pulled on it someday.
4016000	4018000	It's like Pokémon GO.
4018000	4020000	That game's not going to be around forever.
4020000	4023000	I mean, I hope it's around for a long time, but there's money I've spent in that game,
4023000	4026000	and it's going to be money I lose.
4026000	4028000	I'm not going to be able to get that money back.
4028000	4031000	Or like Final Fantasy games.
4031000	4034000	I spent a lot of time in there, invested time.
4034000	4039000	I guess you get monthly fees for those things, but I'm not demanding a refund
4039000	4041000	because they shut the game down eventually.
4041000	4042000	You know, whatever.
4042000	4048000	I think it's nice when they do refunds maybe for the 30 days or the 60 days before the announcement.
4048000	4051000	I think it's nice when companies can do that, and it's good guy Disney,
4051000	4054000	but those are words you don't really hear in the same sentence lately,
4054000	4056000	so I'm not totally surprised.
4058000	4062000	Yeah, it's unfortunate, but I'm sure there will be another online Marvel game at some point.
4064000	4069000	Just keep in mind, at least this is not a game that you spent $60 on,
4069000	4074000	and you're paying microtransactions into, and then now they're kind of pulling away.
4074000	4080000	Or even worse, a game that you had paid money for that's an online only game that they're cutting the services for,
4080000	4082000	and now you have this disc that does nothing.
4082000	4085000	Thankfully, a lot of those, they do refund that stuff.
4085000	4091000	I think they did that with the Warner, the DC Universe one.
4091000	4093000	When they went from, it was originally a buy.
4093000	4095000	There was no online.
4096000	4101000	You had to pay for the disc up front, and then you'd have the game for free.
4101000	4106000	Kind of think of how they have with Elder Scrolls Online, where you buy the disc,
4106000	4111000	but then they went free to play, and so obviously if you have all these discs out there,
4111000	4114000	well, fuck, what are you going to do with those?
4114000	4116000	A lot of the companies will kind of switch it over to,
4116000	4123000	oh, well, we'll give you a perk or something like that because you paid money onto it,
4123000	4129000	or they'll offer refunds for the game disc, and that's what they ended up doing with DC Universe
4129000	4131000	because I think it was shortly after launch that they did that.
4131000	4137000	Or it would be nice too if maybe some of these online-based games would allow their servers to go private,
4137000	4139000	kind of like what happened with Phantasy Star Online, Blue Burst,
4139000	4142000	and then people could transfer their characters to a private server.
4142000	4144000	I think in some ways that's the best way to do it.
4144000	4145000	Disney would never do that.
4145000	4152000	I know they wouldn't, but at the same time, I think that might be to really avoid maybe the negativity.
4152000	4155000	I think that would make people happy, but eh.
4155000	4158000	Anyway, I wonder if this makes people happy.
4158000	4162000	A new DLC character for Tekken 7, some good old DLC,
4162000	4166000	but the DLC character that's been announced, Noctis.
4166000	4170000	That's right, Prince Noctis from Final Fantasy XV.
4170000	4173000	That's the new character in Tekken 7.
4173000	4177000	It was unveiled in a trailer this week, and I think it's released sometime early next year,
4177000	4179000	I think was when the releases.
4179000	4180000	What do you mean?
4180000	4183000	Just that character in Tekken, I just don't see that.
4183000	4187000	I mean, he fights with weapons. How does that work?
4187000	4190000	Well, he's not the first character from another series to come in the game.
4190000	4193000	I can see him for Soul Calibur or something like that, but I don't know.
4193000	4198000	Geese Howard, who of course was Fatal Fury, that whole thing, King of Fighters, technically.
4198000	4200000	Yeah, but that's a fighting character.
4200000	4202000	Well, okay, what about this?
4202000	4207000	So the week we were out, we missed the news about the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles coming in Justice 2,
4207000	4209000	although I think that's kind of rad.
4209000	4210000	That's cool.
4210000	4212000	It's still comic books, right?
4212000	4214000	Yeah, that's better than like...
4214000	4218000	Very easy to palette-swap for all four turtles.
4218000	4219000	Right?
4219000	4222000	That's pretty cool. I'm down with that.
4222000	4225000	Yeah, no, I think a lot of Injustice people are pretty happy about that, so...
4225000	4230000	But, yeah, so the big fighting game DLC news this past couple of weeks,
4230000	4231000	the Ninja Turtles last week, and now...
4231000	4233000	I totally missed that. That's pretty awesome.
4233000	4234000	Oh, you didn't hear about that?
4234000	4235000	No, I didn't hear about that.
4235000	4236000	Yeah, no, Ninja Turtles are in Injustice 2.
4236000	4238000	I still have no interest in Injustice 2, but that's cool.
4238000	4239000	I don't know.
4239000	4240000	I don't know. I just don't like DC characters.
4240000	4242000	It'll be a free game at some point.
4242000	4243000	The first Injustice ended up going...
4243000	4247000	Yeah, I have the first Injustice because of the free stuff, but I never played it.
4247000	4249000	Oh, you should. It's a decent fighting.
4249000	4250000	If you like the Mortal Kombat aspect...
4250000	4251000	I don't.
4251000	4252000	I'm not really a Mortal...
4252000	4253000	I'm a more Street Fighter guy.
4253000	4255000	I don't like Mortal Kombat, but...
4255000	4258000	Yeah, try it out. It's free.
4258000	4264000	Tigerclaw points out that the turtles in Injustice 2 is the closest thing we'll get to a TMNT tournament fighters.
4264000	4265000	Well, never say never.
4265000	4268000	Well, they have a new arcade game coming out, remember? So there's that.
4268000	4269000	Yeah, that's true.
4269000	4273000	Kaijuna says, we want the missing Tekken fighters before we get these other ones.
4273000	4275000	Tekken 7 is awesome.
4275000	4278000	Tekken 7 should have every Tekken character ever made in it.
4278000	4280000	It's the best fighting game out right now.
4280000	4281000	Yeah.
4281000	4287000	William Murderface says, now we need Marvel, cross Capcom, cross Tekken, cross Fire Emblem, cross Persona.
4287000	4290000	Cross Ur-Guys.
4290000	4292000	All right.
4292000	4294000	Anyway, let's move on. Logie.
4294000	4295000	All right.
4295000	4305000	So GameStop had this whole thing that they were trying to test out, this whole power pass where basically it would give you unlimited access to used games.
4305000	4309000	So you'd be able to go into a store and rent the used game.
4309000	4311000	Kind of like what people do already.
4311000	4320000	Some people will buy a used game and you have seven days to return it, no questions asked, and then they return it and get their money back and get another used game.
4320000	4322000	So this is more of a legit way of doing that.
4322000	4327000	However, GameStop has decided to freeze the program right now.
4327000	4344000	They're saying that apparently it's not certain why they kind of froze it, but they're saying right now that it could be that the computer systems that they have weren't able to handle service like that.
4344000	4348000	So they're I guess tweaking that.
4348000	4356000	But they said, we've elected to temporarily pause the rollout of our new power pass subscription service based on a few program limitations we have identified.
4356000	4364000	We feel this is the right thing to do for now to ensure that we're able to provide our guests exceptional service, said one of their spokesmen.
4364000	4368000	And yeah, it's interesting.
4368000	4372000	It's an interesting idea for 60 bucks for six months.
4372000	4374000	That's not bad.
4375000	4378000	I mean, God, I know a lot of people are too young to remember.
4378000	4382000	It's I can't believe I'm saying this are too young to remember Blockbuster.
4382000	4387000	But for $10, unless you're in Alaska, unless you're in Alaska, that's fine.
4387000	4392000	But like $10 and you want to talk about spending a lot of money on games.
4392000	4395000	$10 for a month worth of rentals.
4395000	4397000	That's fucking awesome.
4397000	4402000	I mean, considering that it used to be like $7 a rental for like games.
4402000	4407000	I mean, you get that for a week and that was like a fucking great ass deal at the time.
4407000	4410000	But I know it's neat.
4410000	4412000	I know like I went to GameStop today.
4412000	4419000	So like my son wanted to go in the GameStop just because we're killing time and they have completely remodeled the store that's near me.
4419000	4425000	So now it's like half toys, like half merchandise and stuff in there.
4425000	4429000	It's just completely and it's fine because they've got some cool shit in there.
4429000	4432000	Like they've got stuff that I haven't seen before that's pretty cool.
4432000	4437000	Like they had all sorts of game themed board games.
4437000	4445000	They had a Portal board game that I almost thought about picking up but I didn't want because I don't know if I'd have anybody to actually play it with me.
4445000	4448000	But that was really cool. I've never seen that before.
4448000	4453000	T-shirts. They had a giant Snorlax stuffed Snorlax thing that was really awesome.
4453000	4455000	So they have lots of cool shit like that.
4455000	4461000	I don't mind them having like gaming related gift stuff. That's cool because that kind of differentiates them a little bit.
4461000	4465000	This is a good time of year to have stocking stuffers like that everywhere too.
4465000	4473000	I was disappointed though. I mean like I know I've been looking for some of the you know more like I've been trying to get some of these Lego dimension things cheap.
4473000	4479000	So far I haven't really running across any because it's a Lego the premium you know.
4479000	4484000	I wanted to get the Midway one because it was cool and had like the gamer guy and like the Midway arcade cabinet and stuff like that.
4484000	4490000	But it was like $30 like in like some of the other stores. Like full price. No thank you. I'm not paying that.
4490000	4493000	And that's kind of one of the reasons why that game went downhill.
4493000	4497000	But you know I was kind of looking for some of that stuff hoping that they were clearing that out.
4497000	4501000	But apparently all that's gone. But I mean they still have a selection of stuff.
4501000	4506000	It's just the games are definitely a lot slimmer now. It's not taking up all the shelf space.
4506000	4511000	It's just tons of merchandise now which is not a terrible thing. I don't know.
4511000	4516000	So but yeah I definitely see them trying to make money in different ways. So getting creative.
4516000	4521000	Well they got to they got to stay relevant because as we talked about earlier the whole digital thing is going to going to screw.
4521000	4529000	Let's let's think about it here. I mean where are I mean aside from the game fly where else are you going to rent stuff.
4529000	4539000	Nowhere there's like no rental stores anywhere. There's you know red box but red box has such a limited selection of games unless you're looking for brand new games.
4539000	4546000	It's not a bad idea if you're like looking for that same experience like on the blockbuster and just picking out a game and like renting it.
4546000	4554000	I mean that's you'll be able to play a lot of stuff. A lot of back catalog because they've got a lot of it that they're sitting on.
4554000	4558000	So I mean it's not a terrible idea.
4558000	4565000	All right. Well this was a news story that was linked to us on our Discord server which you can join over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.
4565000	4573000	And apparently the hubbub going on over Battlefront 2 is not the only Angry Gamer story going on right now.
4573000	4581000	We were linked over to and this came in from s2 and under Matt linked over to a Reddit article about the game Black Desert Online.
4581000	4588000	And apparently some protests going on on the North American servers about Black Desert Online and where it's headed in the future.
4588000	4593000	And in this Reddit thread they talked about that they were going to join this particular server.
4593000	4601000	And I guess they're doing a protest podcast to accompany the in-game protest where they're going to talk about the different concerns that are going on for the game.
4601000	4605000	Which include they'd like to do some compensation for server lag.
4605000	4608000	North American players have been dealing with disconnects in the game.
4608000	4616000	Unbanning a very prominent community member named Blue. Balancing the classes a little better.
4616000	4621000	Same with the malicious system. Increasing the drops on scrolls.
4621000	4626000	Helping new players to not have such a barrier to entry.
4626000	4635000	And something called lease webs which I think have to do with I think kind of part of how the game is being run.
4636000	4642000	That lease webs with the servers and all that stuff it's just not working out and it's causing packet loss and so forth.
4642000	4644000	So some gamers taking to the game.
4644000	4649000	And if you don't know Black Desert Online, I feel like didn't we see this at E3?
4649000	4652000	Because I think I remember this game getting my attention and I was like ooh that's pretty.
4652000	4656000	And it's a Korean MMO I think but it's kind of like out over here in the states now.
4656000	4658000	It's a very good looking game.
4658000	4663000	But good graphics are only going to get you so far if you can't connect to the game because you have packet loss.
4663000	4670000	Or you keep getting killed over and over because it's too easy for the veteran players to have a leg up on the new players and so forth.
4670000	4676000	So Kaijuto says how are they protesting in the game? How is that helping the game?
4676000	4678000	I'm not sure if I'm getting the whole Rizzlizzi.
4678000	4683000	If you love the game and want to see join the protest in Calpheon on the Calpheon1 channel at 9pm.
4684000	4691000	Maybe they're trying to take over the game to get other people to hear into their concerns.
4691000	4693000	That might actually be kind of part of it.
4693000	4696000	Is trying to organize first.
4696000	4702000	I guess that's what happened with EA is that once the voices kind of organized themselves on social media and Twitter.
4702000	4705000	That's when you started seeing that backlash on what happened with Battlefront.
4705000	4709000	Because Yudo does bring up a good point. Doesn't that help the game when you protest in the game?
4709000	4711000	Is the game free to play?
4711000	4712000	I don't know.
4712000	4714000	I don't think it is. Interesting.
4714000	4718000	But it's certainly game players that are voicing their concerns.
4718000	4724000	S200Matt says they are refusing to buy certain aspects in the game and crowding the town areas.
4724000	4727000	A few of my friends are really upset about this.
4727000	4732000	DungeonBuster also points out Black Desert Online is also a hardcore grind because of the RNG.
4732000	4738000	Which I hear is legendarily brutal and DungeonBuster also points out it is a $10 game on Steam.
4738000	4740000	It's not free but it's...
4740000	4741000	That's all not bad.
4741000	4743000	Yeah, pretty low amount of money.
4743000	4746000	Well, yeah but it's a waste of $10 if you can't ever connect to the damn game.
4746000	4747000	True.
4747000	4750000	It will be interesting to see if the developers give a shit.
4750000	4755000	The developers are overseas so maybe they don't care what the American audience has to say.
4755000	4757000	But we'll see. Who knows? Who knows?
4757000	4761000	I'll be very interested to see the follow up and see what happens with this.
4761000	4765000	Meanwhile, before we get to the classic game of the week, let's get to another news story from Loki.
4766000	4767000	Alright.
4767000	4771000	So let's talk a little bit about Minecon Earth.
4771000	4775000	So they did this big ol'...
4775000	4783000	Well, instead of having Minecon in like a location, they did this whole webcast thing for like 3 hours on Saturday.
4783000	4786000	And I didn't watch it.
4786000	4789000	I thought about watching it at first.
4789000	4791000	But I missed it live.
4791000	4794000	But then I went back and watched it and my god, they wasted so much goddamn time.
4794000	4800000	I know they have celebrity hosts and stuff but I hate celebrity comedian hosts sometimes.
4800000	4805000	They had Will Arnett doing it and it was really cringey.
4805000	4808000	But there were some announcements and some fun things that they did.
4808000	4813000	So the first thing they did was they actually had 4 different enemy types that they were talking about that they were voting on.
4813000	4818000	And so one of those got voted to be the next new enemy.
4818000	4822000	And so that one is this stingray looking thing that flies in the sky at night.
4822000	4825000	And will attack you if you haven't slept in a few days.
4825000	4829000	And so it's kind of neat.
4829000	4833000	The other one they had was like a souped up blaze.
4833000	4838000	And then they had one that was this monster that attacked you from under the ocean.
4838000	4841000	And then one that was like this chopper thing that would eat you or something.
4841000	4843000	And so they did that.
4843000	4846000	And it looked interesting.
4846000	4849000	So that's going to be implemented at some point soon.
4849000	4856000	They did talk about how the super duper graphics update thing is going to be delayed.
4856000	4858000	Although it looks really nice.
4858000	4860000	So that's kind of cool.
4860000	4867000	And then they have the aquatic update that's going to be coming out with some new enemies and new weapons.
4867000	4869000	So they've got the harpoon now.
4869000	4871000	Or it looks like a trident.
4871000	4873000	I guess it's a trident.
4873000	4878000	And so basically you can take that and you can throw it and you can enchant it so that it comes back to you.
4878000	4880000	Which is kind of cool.
4880000	4882000	So I like that.
4882000	4884000	And then they've got new stuff that they're adding underwater.
4884000	4887000	They have dolphins now which I guess will help point you towards treasure.
4887000	4892000	And they've got underwater like coral and seaweed and fish and stuff like that.
4892000	4898000	So it's actually going to be more populated instead of these barren oceans.
4898000	4904000	And then on top of that they've also added I guess some new biome types as well.
4904000	4906000	Also they have glaciers and that type of thing.
4906000	4908000	Icebergs.
4908000	4910000	So neat.
4910000	4912000	And so I'm not sure.
4912000	4914000	It looks like the graphics pack is going to be delayed until 2018.
4914000	4919000	The aquatic pack is going to be coming soon.
4919000	4923000	But they haven't really said when yet for that one.
4923000	4929000	But if you do play a little bit of Minecraft and you are interested, they do have some free content out there now.
4929000	4935000	So you can go to the Minecraft store that they added to the game and download free skins that they have for that as well.
4935000	4937000	So go get those skins.
4937000	4939000	Go get the little world that they had.
4939000	4941000	And free stuff.
4941000	4943000	But yes, seriously though.
4943000	4945000	It was a goddamn waste.
4945000	4947000	Although they did some musical numbers and they were kind of funny.
4947000	4949000	One of them was at least.
4949000	4951000	The other one was not.
4951000	4953000	Do you think you'll still keep an eye on Minecraft with these changes and updates?
4953000	4955000	A little bit.
4955000	4957000	Like some of the stuff they were talking about was in game.
4958000	4960000	I guess they have the whole...
4960000	4962000	I forget what they call them because I still haven't played too much Minecraft recently.
4962000	4964000	I get bored with it so fast.
4964000	4966000	I keep going back to it.
4966000	4970000	I did play Minecraft this week as well actually on the Windows 10 version.
4970000	4972000	And I just get bored with it.
4972000	4974000	Survival mode is kind of boring.
4974000	4976000	Because it's not really forcing you to...
4976000	4978000	You're not really running out of resources really fast.
4978000	4980000	It's more of just like...
4980000	4982000	Okay, I better dig down to...
4982000	4985000	You kind of have to force yourself to try to get to these objectives.
4985000	4988000	There's nothing really kind of pushing you to do it.
4988000	4991000	There's not challenging you to survive or anything.
4991000	4993000	It's kind of easy.
4993000	4995000	I don't know.
4995000	4999000	I mean I could bump up the difficulty but that just makes it so I have to bash in things longer.
4999000	5001000	That doesn't really do anything.
5001000	5003000	Alright.
5003000	5005000	Well even though Minecraft is a classic looking game.
5005000	5009000	Let's take a moment to talk about the classic game of the week.
5009000	5013000	Every week Dark Soccer likes to step into the gaming vault and find the game that she thinks...
5013000	5015000	Hey!
5015000	5017000	You brats!
5017000	5019000	You should recognize this game this week.
5019000	5021000	This game doesn't have loot boxes.
5021000	5023000	Go check this game out.
5023000	5025000	It's the classic game of the week.
5025000	5027000	But Dark Soccer is not here.
5027000	5029000	So...
5029000	5031000	I'm going to take over tonight.
5031000	5035000	And I'm taking over in the spirit of the 19 November holiday that we had today.
5035000	5037000	No, I didn't pick a Bamani game tonight.
5037000	5041000	But I did pick a game that I thought maybe we wouldn't have had Bamani.
5041000	5045000	Or Dance Dance Revolution or any of that stuff if it wasn't for this game.
5045000	5047000	So that's why I picked...
5047000	5049000	Dance Aerobics!
5049000	5051000	That's right.
5051000	5053000	Dance Aerobics.
5053000	5057000	The NES release that required the power pad in order to be able to play this game.
5057000	5059000	So...
5059000	5061000	With the sweet voice synthesis you can hear it going...
5061000	5063000	Come on!
5063000	5065000	One, two, three.
5065000	5067000	I think those are the only words in the whole game.
5067000	5069000	Come on and then one, two, three, four.
5069000	5071000	Over and over and over again.
5071000	5073000	And the sweet NES backdrop music that's playing there.
5073000	5075000	Anyway...
5075000	5079000	So Dance Aerobics was released by Nintendo in North America.
5079000	5083000	And it was released by Bandai overseas in Japan.
5083000	5085000	Because it was kind of Bandai's power pad over there.
5085000	5089000	It came out in Japan in 1987 on February 26th.
5089000	5095000	It came out in North America March 1989 as one of the games for the power pad.
5095000	5099000	It was originally the third game in Bandai's Family Trainer series.
5099000	5103000	And it uses side B of the infamous power pad.
5103000	5105000	Every game used side B.
5105000	5108000	You may not remember the power pad had side A and side B.
5108000	5109000	I don't remember that.
5109000	5111000	Side B was the 12 numbers.
5111000	5115000	Side A was where it had like the two red dots in the center.
5115000	5119000	And then there were like six blue dots around it.
5119000	5121000	And I don't think like any game used that.
5121000	5124000	So anyway, Dance Aerobics used side B.
5124000	5127000	And it had several different modes to it.
5127000	5129000	Including normal mode.
5129000	5131000	Where you have different aerobics classes.
5131000	5134000	And you play through the classes to unlock more classes.
5134000	5137000	You follow the motions of the instructor by stepping on the buttons.
5137000	5139000	When the instructor steps on the buttons.
5139000	5142000	And sometimes it's going to involve the hands.
5142000	5145000	Some of the more advanced levels you might put your hands on one and four.
5145000	5147000	And then your legs are on nine and ten.
5147000	5149000	And you're like kicking up your legs.
5149000	5151000	So you know it is.
5151000	5156000	I mean especially you know this game is what a lot of people kind of think of or joke about.
5156000	5159000	Especially when we talk about the whole exercise gaming craze.
5159000	5162000	That really took over when the Kinect was released right.
5162000	5164000	Because the Kinect could really follow you.
5164000	5166000	Well this in some ways was a precursor to that.
5166000	5170000	Except obviously the dance pad was the only thing that could really know what you're doing.
5170000	5172000	So I'm sure tons of people would cheat at this.
5172000	5174000	But if you get a game like Dance Aerobics.
5174000	5178000	I would imagine the idea behind is that you're actually going to follow the routines.
5178000	5181000	And you may get a little bit of exercise doing that.
5183000	5184000	Let's see.
5184000	5186000	You start with a score of one hundred.
5186000	5188000	And with each mistake you make.
5188000	5190000	Your score is reduced by ten.
5190000	5195000	And it only goes up if you completely correctly do a routine.
5195000	5197000	If the counter reaches zero.
5197000	5198000	You've failed.
5198000	5202000	And then the games will go on as the player passes levels.
5202000	5205000	New harder songs are unlocked and the difficulty goes up.
5205000	5206000	There are other modes too.
5206000	5208000	You can go into something called pad antics.
5208000	5210000	Where you get tune up.
5210000	5213000	Where the two buttons in the center of the power pad are deactivated.
5213000	5217000	And the rest of the ten pads are assigned different musical notes.
5217000	5219000	So it's just basically stomp and make music.
5219000	5221000	I bet kids would love that shit.
5221000	5224000	Mat Melodies you would stand on the center pad.
5224000	5227000	And then the game plays a short song and you repeat it back.
5227000	5229000	So like assignment says with that whole thing.
5229000	5231000	And then there's ditto.
5231000	5234000	Which basically you use a hand or a foot on the power pad.
5234000	5236000	It's basically solo twister.
5236000	5238000	Which I'm sure is tons of fun right?
5238000	5240000	But that's what ditto was.
5240000	5241000	So there you go.
5241000	5244000	And then in aerobics mode you have the four original songs from normal mode.
5244000	5245000	They're all available.
5245000	5248000	But when the counter reaches zero the music continues.
5248000	5251000	And the player can attempt to mimic the moves by the instructor.
5251000	5252000	But there's no progression.
5252000	5255000	You can think of it as like a type of easy mode if you will.
5255000	5258000	So at the end of the day I mean it was a pretty simple game.
5258000	5259000	It was on the NES.
5259000	5261000	There wasn't a whole lot of else to it.
5261000	5263000	But I think this game is important to acknowledge.
5263000	5267000	Because it is a precursor certainly to the whole exercise gaming thing.
5267000	5271000	And even a game like DDR which we're kind of you know celebrating here.
5271000	5273000	With it being this weekend.
5273000	5276000	Even though there were no scrolling notes on the screen.
5276000	5279000	Which is very you know reminiscent of that series.
5279000	5283000	Certainly there is the whole follow what I'm doing on this mat.
5283000	5285000	Which is very similar to what we got with DDR.
5285000	5287000	So and it's to the beat of the music.
5287000	5289000	And as she counts along.
5289000	5290000	So there it is.
5290000	5292000	Your classic game of the week.
5292000	5301000	Dance Aerobics by Bandai in 1987 for the Japanese Famicom.
5301000	5303000	1989 all the way here in the US.
5303000	5305000	Because it took us a while to get the power pad if you remember right.
5305000	5306000	There it is.
5306000	5307000	Classic game of the week.
5307000	5311000	Looking in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
5312000	5314000	William Murderface says since Stark Sakura is gone.
5314000	5316000	Do we get Halo as classic game of the week?
5316000	5318000	No because I value my life.
5318000	5321000	Come on Noel Gus says Zumba on the Wii was pretty fun.
5321000	5324000	Alright we're gonna take a quick break.
5324000	5326000	But when we come back there's plenty more show to come.
5326000	5327000	Including rapid fire news.
5327000	5330000	We're gonna get to your emails and what's in stores as well.
5330000	5333000	We're gonna talk about the potential of Mario Brothers becoming a movie.
5333000	5335000	And we'll talk a little bit about the Vive.
5335000	5337000	And the future direction for that.
5337000	5338000	So that'll be fun.
5338000	5340000	And maybe Mr. Schmoosh will say hello.
5340000	5341000	Mr. Schmoosh.
5341000	5344000	He just looks at the mic and I think he's trying to smoosh.
5344000	5347000	See I call him Mr. Schmoosh not just because he has the smooshy face.
5347000	5349000	But he smooshes his face into things.
5349000	5350000	Like the mic.
5350000	5355000	So anyway he's sitting in one of our guest chairs right now just chillin.
5355000	5356000	So anyway.
5356000	5357000	We're gonna take a break.
5357000	5360000	We'll come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
5360000	5370000	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio Live Tonight.
5370000	5372000	Episode number 707 of our show.
5372000	5375000	For this 19 November of 2017.
5375000	5378000	Just myself and Loki here in studio tonight.
5378000	5380000	Dark Sakura she's out tonight.
5380000	5382000	She had a charity event that she's doing.
5382000	5385000	So we're just here holding down the fort with the news.
5385000	5388000	You missed a whole lot of talk about loot box in the first half.
5388000	5389000	If you're just joining us live tonight.
5389000	5392000	But it'll all be there for you on the podcast feed.
5392000	5395000	A big shout out to everybody that listens to us on the podcast feed.
5395000	5399000	Are you guys listening to our pal Bobby Blackwell from the podcast feed as well?
5399000	5403000	Cause I wanted to give a cheap plug for his show that he did last week while we were gone.
5403000	5407000	So I think some of you might have missed it because you may have also been gone because of a long weekend.
5407000	5409000	And we weren't here live.
5409000	5412000	So some of you may have missed this live.
5412000	5415000	But check out episode 592 of Bobby's show.
5415000	5419000	He actually interviewed somebody who was a listener of his.
5419000	5420000	Actually still is.
5420000	5423000	But you know just not participating as much live.
5423000	5430000	But Tim came on the show to talk about the archive team and the Miiverse preservation project.
5430000	5433000	Because Nintendo of course closed Miiverse while we were gone.
5433000	5436000	And so it's talking a little bit about the Miiverse preservation project.
5436000	5437000	What it is.
5437000	5438000	Why they're doing it.
5438000	5440000	And you know how it might change from region to region.
5440000	5441000	And so on and so forth.
5441000	5442000	So check that out.
5442000	5446000	It's also the big plug at vognetwork.com right now.
5446000	5449000	So you can just click on that and go right to it.
5449000	5450000	I should also give a shout out as well.
5450000	5455000	If I'm going to shout out Bobby I also need to shout out our other great gaming shows we have here at the Voice Geek Network.
5455000	5457000	We have a lot of great shows on the network.
5457000	5459000	But specifically of course our gaming buddies.
5459000	5461000	I have to say hello to Electric Sistahood.
5461000	5462000	And check in with them.
5462000	5463000	And Game Buoy is back.
5463000	5465000	They were on a little bit of a break.
5465000	5467000	But Game Buoy just put out a new episode not that long ago.
5467000	5469000	So check out Electric Sistahood and Game Buoy.
5469000	5473000	They are both there on the network at vognetwork.com as well.
5473000	5475000	Alright let's get back into some news.
5475000	5476000	Rapid Fire style.
5476000	5477000	Loki.
5477000	5478000	Yes.
5478000	5481000	So let's talk a little bit about Pokemans Go.
5481000	5484000	So they've got some new things with that.
5484000	5488000	Including you can get some of the low end fashion now for your characters.
5488000	5489000	That's right.
5489000	5493000	So Pokemon Sun Ultra Sun Ultra Moon are coming out.
5493000	5496000	Or I should say have already come out.
5496000	5498000	And now they have to kind of go along with that.
5498000	5501000	There is some new things you can get.
5501000	5503000	When can I get a new face?
5503000	5504000	Never.
5504000	5506000	You can never change your face.
5506000	5509000	So you can get a straw hat.
5509000	5510000	A tank top.
5510000	5512000	And looks like shorts.
5512000	5513000	And yeah.
5513000	5516000	So those are available right now.
5516000	5517000	So go check it out.
5517000	5519000	I don't know if they cost anything.
5519000	5520000	Hopefully not.
5520000	5521000	They don't.
5521000	5522000	Sweet.
5522000	5523000	Alright.
5523000	5526000	And then they have this new Pokemon Go event.
5526000	5531000	That this Pokemon Go travel and the global catch challenge.
5531000	5545000	So with that I guess they're saying they guess Pokemon Go travel is taking I guess groups of trainers from around the world to Japan to host the first ever global catch challenge.
5545000	5552000	And so with that I guess they're trying to catch three billion Pokemon in seven days.
5552000	5555000	That's a lot.
5556000	5561000	So then with that I guess there's different rewards that people can get.
5561000	5563000	So double XP.
5563000	5566000	So for five million catches of bronze.
5566000	5572000	I guess everyone gets double XP as well as I guess the.
5572000	5574000	Oh what the hell do they call those six hour lures.
5574000	5575000	Yes the lures.
5575000	5576000	Thank you.
5576000	5577000	The lures are six hours.
5577000	5579000	So it's silver.
5579000	5583000	You're going to be getting double XP the six hour lures and also double stardust.
5583000	5599000	And finally if they do end up catching three billion then you'll get the double XP six hour lures double stardust Farfetch'd will be available worldwide for 48 hours and Kangaskhan will be available in East Asia.
5599000	5611000	That's a big freaking deal because that's one of those regional exclusives you can't catch Farfetch'd here in the US right now Farfetch'd is exclusive to Asia which is why they're getting Kangaskhan instead because it wouldn't matter if they got Farfetch'd because they already have it.
5612000	5626000	So this is a really big deal that you know you were going to have a chance to catch a regional exclusive outside what Anaheim I think was the only place you could do that before they had Kangaskhan available I think during that actual Pokemon worlds event that was down in Anaheim but that's really it.
5626000	5640000	So it's going to be the first chance you know in America we've had to catch Farfetch'd assuming we meet that three billion Pokemon mark but I don't know I have I have never known this game to announce rewards they didn't end up giving out.
5640000	5662000	And that same thing happened remember with go fest or it was like oh we're just going to give you all the rewards and I was kind of that was good I kind of think fucked up well and I also think that was always the intended thing to do you don't want to dangle that stuff in front of people and then not give it to them so I kind of think you're going to get it anyway but but why not go release you know everything I suppose.
5663000	5680000	JD in chat says Chicago did a thing where they released regional exclusives during the big meltdown event oh that's right they were able to get was a Heracross I think was available there which usually is something you can only get in like South Florida you have to be below a certain latitude.
5680000	5690000	You have to be below a certain latitude to get Heracross and you can get it in parts of South Florida for the most part it's Latin America's Pokemon.
5690000	5696000	So anyway let's move on you got one more thing for us right Logan?
5696000	5705000	So then they're adding I don't know how to feel about this I still don't I saw the agents of mayhem today at GameStop and I'm like oh yeah that game came out didn't it.
5705000	5718000	Like I forgot all about it already but they have DLC coming out now Saints Rose Kinsey is joining them as her call sign is was it safe word.
5718000	5729000	Because she's a nerd but she's in the BDSM he he he that's funny hot nerd yeah alright so anyways so she's now available as DLC for $5.
5731000	5733000	I love me some Saints Row.
5734000	5742000	I will never buy agents of mayhem really that's so surprising why didn't you end up getting this I would have thought you would have been all over this agents of mayhem is not Saints Row.
5742000	5756000	It's it's not and the game is not that great so no thanks all right maybe when it's like dirt cheap it will probably someday be something I get in the humble bundle but I'm never I'm never buying this game as it is right now.
5756000	5768000	You're not you're not mad at it because it's not Saints Row I am mad at it but I'm also mad at it because it's crap and like if it was a guy give me give me what one reason why it's crap the gameplay is cheap.
5768000	5773000	It's just not in as the missions are all basically the same.
5774000	5784000	There's the humor that it seems very forced and I don't like this whole oh it was originally going to be its own thing like I remember when it first got out.
5784000	5795000	Oh no this isn't going to be Saints Row we just want to come up with this new game ball and then they throw Johnny get in there and all said now it's just a spin off of the universe of Saints Row.
5795000	5807000	It's like OK dude how much confidence did you have in your game where originally it was just going to be its own thing but then you lost confidence and so now it's part of Saints Row because people like Saints Row.
5807000	5812000	It's just it's such a desperate attempt to get people to buy this game.
5812000	5813000	No thank you.
5813000	5816000	I don't I don't want to play this game.
5816000	5817000	It's not Saints Row.
5817000	5819000	Give me a fucking Saints Row game.
5819000	5827000	All right all right moving on to a game that I think Loki has less of a problem with actually it may not be true because it's a Konami game dance dance revolution.
5827000	5829000	Oh yes I hate dance dance revolution.
5829000	5837000	Well anyway I know because it is 19 November I should give a shout out to this this project going on in the community.
5837000	5846000	They call it Delta Max why they call it Delta Delta show short for DDR extreme lots of triple A's and what they're trying to do is they're trying to perfect full combo.
5846000	5859000	All of the songs on DDR extreme that's 256 songs on DDR extreme that's that's kind of an older game at this point but it was probably the most easy one to find in arcades for a long time because it was a big lull after that.
5859000	5871000	So anyway it started today it started at 1 o'clock Eastern and they're trying to go through as fast as possible and see how long it's going to take to perfect combo every song in the game.
5871000	5880000	And I guess they had a Google Doc sheet to do this. Did they do it because the previous record was seven hours so it's already been seven hours so I want to know if they already beat it or not.
5880000	5887000	I guess should I go to the Google Doc sheet and see if they did it. Why not. I'm bringing it up right now.
5887000	5893000	You're leaving Facebook to follow. I know I was on Facebook in the first place. Let's see did they do it.
5893000	5897000	They did but I didn't see how how long did it take them.
5897000	5902000	Dr. Seuss is going to have to break this down for me. I don't know how long it took him to do it.
5902000	5909000	But I do know that Carlos got 68 of those combos so he's number one. So good job Carlos.
5909000	5922000	All right. One more story about pinball FX 3 pinball FX 3 is been delayed a little bit on the switch was supposed to be out by now but it's coming out on the e-shop early next month.
5922000	5933000	However Zen studios is explaining why they've delayed it. And I got to say this does sound like a pretty rad reason what they've done is they've added functionality so you can play vertical.
5933000	5945000	So you can take your switch and now turn it sideways and you can play it vertically with a single joy con the single joy con is meant to be attached to the console still to have that weight.
5945000	5954000	So you hold the screen basically vertically I guess kind of like by the joy covers. There's no stand to hold it vertically. So it took them five hours and 21 minutes.
5954000	5967000	Where'd you find that. I was on their Facebook. Oh there you go. Thank you. All right. Five hours 21 minutes. Well that's extra time you can play pinball FX 3 on the switch when it comes out and the vertical mode and that actually that actually does sound kind of rad.
5967000	5985000	And then studios actually points out this was a suggestion of somebody at Nintendo who loves pinball to do this. So that's pretty neat. What do you think of that that they're using the switches technology of basically being a handheld TV to flip the TV on its side and present the pinball vertically using more space.
5985000	5988000	PSP did it first.
5988000	6003000	Simpsons did it. No I mean it's nice that they're actually doing that but like you know it's not innovative. It's just it's makes sense. I don't know. It sounds kind of cool. All right. Let's travel around the world and check out what is in stores this week.
6003000	6015000	Bobby Black Wolf in chat says they did this on the Vita version of Zen pinball. I'm surprised this was a new revelation to them. All right fine. It shows you how much I paid attention to the Vita was travel around the world and check out what is coming out in stores this week.
6015000	6029000	It might be slowing down a bit though with Thanksgiving. Yeah I think it's definitely slowing down. They typically don't release a whole ton of stuff. Thanksgiving week so you know but this week we do have a few things coming out.
6029000	6045000	So starting off we've got Luma which is on the Nintendo switch gear club unlimited also on the switch project Nimbus code Mariah on PlayStation 4 super beat Sonic on the Nintendo switch.
6045000	6065000	And of course Animal Crossing pocket camp on Android and iOS portal nights coming out on the switch. And I didn't realize this was a thing that was coming out. But I am super excited about this now that I've just discovered this again.
6065000	6085000	I think it's either I don't know if it's a spin off or what but they have the Earth Defense Force 4.1 wing diver the shooter coming out. So I don't remember if that was I don't know if that's an expansion or if that's I think that's just for I don't know. I don't know what that is.
6086000	6099000	All right travel look into that traveling over to Japan. It's not Thanksgiving over there but I think things are still slowing down a little bit. But we do have you know some releases this week including Hatsune Miku Project Diva future tone DX.
6099000	6108000	I was gonna say I thought this game was already out but this sounds like it's a DX version that's coming out. So that is going to be available from Sega and that is out on the 22nd so you can check that out.
6108000	6129000	Otherwise this week let's see looking at the Nintendo Switch Breath of the Wild with some type of guidebook and world map limited edition. So I kind of thought this was already a thing that was out but I guess this is just to match the explorers edition that's out in the US which sounds like it might be like a rebundling of the game for basically the holiday audience for people that didn't already buy it.
6129000	6136000	I think that's what it is where they basically including some other physical garbage to make everything interesting again.
6136000	6142000	So Wing Diver the Shooter is a vertical shooter game set in the Earth Defense Force 4.1 universe.
6142000	6143000	Well that'll be fun.
6143000	6144000	That's interesting.
6144000	6162000	Yeah and the Vita there's just one release Kamidonami Sushi Gute Ore no Mirai Ga Ya Bai in regular and limited edition and yes that I said the Vita because even though I'm not paying attention to the Vita here people in Japan are still paying attention over there because they still release games on it so that's really it for releases this week in Japan.
6163000	6165000	Oh I didn't check the 3DS actually.
6165000	6169000	Beeblay God is the lone release on the 3DS this week.
6169000	6171000	How about the UK do you have that up Logie?
6171000	6174000	No but I can so let's do that.
6174000	6176000	With our Sakura not being here somebody's got to do it.
6176000	6179000	I'm sure they're getting probably the same stuff we're getting over here.
6179000	6181000	Not a whole ton of things.
6181000	6186000	So let's see for this week we've got actually nothing.
6186000	6188000	I don't show anything on the list here.
6189000	6195000	I would assume Animal Crossing is coming out probably in that region as well.
6195000	6197000	So that's probably a thing.
6197000	6200000	Yeah I mean if we're getting it here they should be getting it there right?
6200000	6207000	Yeah your reamer's lists are kind of vague on a lot of things so I'm going to assume that Animal Crossing is coming out.
6207000	6209000	So look for that.
6209000	6211000	And if you're wrong then you're wrong.
6211000	6212000	And who cares.
6212000	6215000	Alright I got to get in the mail bag I forgot I had to do this tonight.
6218000	6227000	Every week you guys send us emails participate at orange lounge radio dot com.
6227000	6231000	And we log into the mail bag and read some of our favorites here on the air.
6231000	6233000	And I know we have at least a couple that came in this week.
6233000	6235000	So I want to get to it.
6235000	6237000	I thought we did.
6237000	6239000	Where'd they go?
6241000	6244000	I feel like this is sorted a different way than it used to be.
6244000	6246000	Hold on there we go alright.
6247000	6249000	Jamie messed up that mail bag while she was in there just kidding.
6249000	6253000	Alright let's get to it we have a couple emails to read here tonight.
6253000	6257000	The first email tonight is coming from Robert M.
6258000	6260000	Who emails us and says.
6260000	6267000	The originally line published Skullgirls mobile game and Pokemon Go just had somewhat significant updates.
6267000	6271000	Double for the former gen 3 ghost type ladder.
6271000	6275000	Which had me realizing both are free games in which I've not seen a single ad.
6275000	6278000	I don't have the option to watch ads for gems or coins.
6278000	6280000	I don't have ads forced on me.
6280000	6283000	There's just no advertisements period.
6283000	6285000	Of course both games do have in app purchases.
6285000	6288000	I admit buying a few coins for a few cosmetics.
6288000	6289000	Okay glasses.
6289000	6292000	For my trainer before being able to earn coins in gyms.
6292000	6296000	I admire these kinds of models and have to ask.
6296000	6300000	Besides probably ingress are there any apps on your phone or device which are.
6300000	6301000	A. Free.
6301000	6303000	B. Ad free.
6303000	6307000	C. You don't feel forced into in app purchases for basic progression.
6307000	6310000	Thanks and have a great week wherever you are.
6310000	6316000	I'll open that question up to the chat too because I only have so many cell phone games that I play.
6316000	6319000	You guys probably have many more.
6319000	6323000	What games do you meet Robert M's specifications there?
6323000	6327000	It's a free game ad free and you don't feel forced into in app purchases for progression.
6327000	6332000	I don't have any of those and unfortunately the game I play the office space one.
6332000	6335000	It gets worse every week like they keep introducing stuff.
6335000	6339000	When I first started playing it was pretty straightforward and how you play that.
6339000	6344000	Now it's so fucking convoluted and complicated with like multiple currencies in there.
6344000	6349000	And just like all sorts of things that they want you to watch ads and like slow your progression down.
6349000	6350000	It's just.
6350000	6351000	It's a mess.
6351000	6354000	I would say honestly even Pokemon go.
6354000	6357000	I mean as much as I enjoy that game and I play that game.
6357000	6362000	Like if you don't know what you're doing or you live in a more rural area where you don't have a lot of pokey stops.
6362000	6364000	You're going to run out of pokey balls.
6364000	6367000	You know and so you're kind of forced into in app purchases that way.
6367000	6369000	I don't have that problem because I live in a bigger city.
6369000	6374000	I've bought pokey balls though before and they have had a balancing thing that's happened.
6374000	6378000	So you don't get as many potions now because you get those from raids which is a whole nother change.
6378000	6386000	But it would be cool if you could watch like an ad or something once a day to get like 10 pokey coins or like something ridiculously small.
6386000	6391000	My assumption is if more and more people abandon Pokemon Go they'll go that route eventually.
6391000	6396000	I mean if they have to do ads to keep the lights on then that's what they'll do.
6396000	6399000	To Ingress's credit with as long as I've been playing that game.
6399000	6402000	You really you really aren't coursed into buying anything in that game.
6402000	6408000	And even the in app purchases like I think I've maybe only ever spent with as much as I've talked about that game on the show.
6408000	6410000	You guys I think I've maybe only ever spent ten dollars on it.
6410000	6412000	Yeah probably about the same.
6412000	6414000	Out in the game itself.
6414000	6418000	Now I've paid more gas in my car for this fucking thing.
6418000	6419000	Data plans.
6419000	6421000	I don't have to pay for that thank god.
6421000	6423000	I've gone to Ingress live events.
6423000	6426000	Including there's one coming up in San Francisco on December 2nd.
6426000	6429000	A live event and I'm paying basically money to do that.
6429000	6434000	So you know just a little bit it's not a lot but still I mean I guess there is that.
6435000	6439000	Let's see I'm trying to think of games I have on my phone.
6440000	6443000	Well there's Draconius Go.
6443000	6445000	Pokemon Go's new little competitor.
6445000	6447000	Oh yeah I forgot about that.
6447000	6451000	Miitomo I didn't really feel coursed into buying anything in Miitomo.
6451000	6457000	I was playing that nonstop night for a while and I don't remember really being coursed into buying stuff on that.
6457000	6463000	You can watch ads for crystals and they have like a daily deal or like a deal that happens every few hours.
6463000	6465000	Yeah that's right I do remember watching a lot of ads.
6465000	6467000	You can do an ad for that.
6467000	6474000	Or like they'll do like oh you've been away for like a couple hours you can double your money that you've earned during that time if you watch an ad or something.
6474000	6476000	Yeah I forgot about that.
6476000	6478000	You don't have to do it.
6478000	6480000	But I mean I don't know.
6480000	6485000	Let's see looking in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
6485000	6490000	Let's see Fifth Dream says Final Fantasy Brave Exvius kind of doesn't.
6490000	6495000	It has an area with promotions for in-game purchases but I don't notice anything that pops up telling you to buy things.
6496000	6501000	Dungeon Buster says the only cell phone game I have was Tiny Death Star on my old phone.
6501000	6505000	Sorry that Tiny Tower I remember when everybody was playing the shit out of that.
6505000	6507000	Is that still a thing? Do people still play Tiny Tower?
6507000	6509000	Is it ad free? I don't remember.
6509000	6511000	Let's see.
6511000	6515000	Bobby Blackwolf says I doubt there are any free games that have no ads in them.
6515000	6520000	Even the little word puzzle games I play that have a free puzzle every day have ads for their other puzzles in them.
6521000	6527000	JD says Pokemon Shuffle gets a little pay to winnish and I know people that bought money in Miitomo.
6527000	6530000	If you got really serious about the dress up it has a bit of a coin.
6530000	6535000	What kind of phone does he have? Is it Android or iOS?
6535000	6538000	I don't think it was called out in the email actually.
6538000	6548000	If you're looking for like games you know what would be kind of fun is like I find I follow like a lot of different subreddits and so one of them is the Unity 3D one.
6548000	6552000	And so you'll see occasionally people will put their games up there and say hey go try out my game.
6552000	6554000	And it's free.
6554000	6560000	So you can go download it and there's usually no ads and that type of stuff so that's one thing to check out.
6560000	6562000	Or just like you know the game dev forum.
6562000	6566000	So something a little more under the radar for somebody who's just a proud person.
6566000	6574000	Sometimes there's fun stuff like there's a game I have called Flip Stuff that's kind of frustrating but it's a game where you basically flip an object and you try to get the land a certain way.
6574000	6578000	And I've played that for hours at one time and there's no ads in that.
6578000	6584000	I mean so it's you can find stuff that people make and I don't know it's kind of fun sometimes.
6584000	6590000	JD also points out Tiny Tower is definitely not ad free lol they have a new one Tiny Tower Vegas.
6590000	6602000	There's a lot of games like Plants vs. Zombies and stuff that you've played before that now new versions are just it's just remember Plants vs. Zombies and PopCap they're owned by EA.
6602000	6608000	EA is evil so take it like I don't know what you expect.
6608000	6613000	Alright I've got another email here one more this week from Redertainment who emails us.
6613000	6619000	Hello peoples I have a thought about the debate between digital copies of video games and physical copies of video games.
6619000	6621000	A thought that encompasses other things.
6621000	6625000	My inclination is toward physical copies of things before because of price.
6625000	6633000	The price of physical copies of things usually goes down over time due to a number of factors ranging from market forces to the retailer needing room for other things.
6633000	6636000	Digital copies of things do not tend to go down over time.
6636000	6645000	Sure there's sales for digital goods but prices are not the norm and if we include sales as a reasoning for this argument we also need to include sales of physical goods.
6646000	6648000	Look up the price of an album released last year.
6648000	6653000	Specifically the digital version on iTunes and a physical version of the same album on Amazon.
6653000	6658000	Because you can't look up the price at your local independent record store as you read this because the store is closed right now.
6658000	6659000	True.
6659000	6666000	I can guarantee the price of the physical version of the album is lower by at least a couple of dollars compared to the digital version.
6666000	6671000	The same can be said of video games, books, TV shows, movies, etc. etc. Pie.
6671000	6674000	There's a small wrinkle in this for me.
6674000	6678000	Back in March a number of big plastic tubs were stolen from a unit I had at a storage facility.
6678000	6683000	Insert 2,000 word all caps rant about a police department you've never heard of here.
6683000	6691000	For a few months after that theft I preferred- wait did the police steal your games? Like what happened there? It sucks either way. Sorry to hear that.
6691000	6701000	For a few months after that theft I preferred digital copies because while I did lose a good number of physical copies of vintage video games I did not lose any of my digital copies of things.
6702000	6709000	However, now that I've moved to a place where I have access to a secure storage unit, I'm back to preferring physical copies of things.
6709000	6711000	Stay black. Retertainment.
6711000	6715000	Yay. OLR is great. Jamie is rad. Loki is okay.
6715000	6718000	I sell for okay.
6718000	6720000	Well thank you for that email, Retertainment.
6721000	6733000	It sounds like you've really gone back and forth on them is that that whole shitty situation with the theft kind of made you see like oh there is some value in digital because I don't lose shit digitally.
6733000	6741000	But at the same time you know it's kind of nice to have the physical stuff and you're right the physical stuff tends to get discounted first for good or for worse.
6741000	6750000	It almost ties into that what we were talking about earlier at the top of the show where I said if a game is really worth $70 then fine put the game out at $70.
6750000	6756000	But we all know in the back of our head it's going to end up in the bargain bin of 30 or 40 bucks eventually.
6756000	6762000	Especially all that DLC. Oh you want to charge me all this money for the DLC you can't tell me you're going to have a game of the year edition that's coming out?
6762000	6766000	So the question is how bad do I need that game now?
6766000	6768000	Subreddit patient gamers.
6768000	6773000	But to be fair the movie industry has had to deal with this since the 80s.
6773000	6775000	Yeah.
6775000	6781000	Because should I pay the $15 how much does it fucking cost to see a movie these days? It's expensive.
6781000	6784000	It's expensive because like you're talking like.
6784000	6786000	If you cut out the popcorn and junior mint DLC.
6786000	6788000	I can I need it I need it.
6788000	6791000	That's why I go there half the time is to eat the popcorn.
6791000	6795000	Okay but if you cut out the large Diet Coke DLC.
6795000	6801000	I don't like see that's the thing now is like I get a small soda which is still like a gallon of soda and so.
6801000	6807000	I paid $45 a ticket to see a movie that came out in 1997 over the weekend.
6807000	6809000	Romeo and Michelle's high school reunion.
6809000	6818000	But they had drag queens doing a full pre-show including for those that follow that whole scene Trixie and Katya were doing Romeo and Michelle.
6818000	6822000	So I'm sorry worth every fucking penny that I paid to see that.
6822000	6825000	And Dark Soccer I'm sure I want to talk about that next week when she's back.
6825000	6828000	But that certainly made me want to go see something in the theater.
6828000	6831000	And I spent money on soda DLC.
6831000	6833000	But anyway the point I was trying to make.
6833000	6835000	The movie industry has been dealing with this since the 80s.
6835000	6839000	They said that VHS and the whole home video market was gonna fucking kill him.
6839000	6842000	Because nobody would go to the theater to see a movie anymore.
6842000	6845000	But people still go to the movies.
6845000	6848000	People still saw Justice League. Did anyone see Justice League this weekend?
6848000	6850000	I don't know how it did at the box office.
6850000	6852000	I didn't read the box office results.
6852000	6854000	I think people saw it. I don't know. I'm not gonna go see it.
6854000	6856000	Although I have taken a day off.
6856000	6858000	I've taken the 15th off to go see Star Wars.
6858000	6862000	But see that day I'm planning on seeing Star Wars, Thor.
6865000	6867000	Not sure about Justice League.
6867000	6869000	But at least those two.
6869000	6871000	I'm not hating on Justice League.
6871000	6876000	Because I haven't seen any movie at all since Shane dragged me to Power Rangers back in late March.
6876000	6880000	But you'll know. Star Wars, they have opening shows at 9am that day.
6880000	6884000	So I'm on a full day of popcorn and unhealthy shit.
6884000	6886000	So anyway.
6886000	6892000	But people still pay the premium money to go see something on the big screen.
6892000	6895000	As opposed to, eh, I'll just wait for it to be on HBO or Netflix.
6895000	6900000	Which is kind of the modern, since you say blockbusters are gone, which they are.
6900000	6902000	You don't really wait for it on video anymore.
6902000	6904000	Because if you buy the blu-ray, you're gonna play probably...
6904000	6905000	I miss...
6905000	6907000	Well, it depends on the size of your family.
6907000	6913000	If you take a family of four to go see a new Pixar movie, it actually is cheaper to just buy the $30 blu-ray.
6913000	6915000	It is. Much.
6915000	6917000	Even just one person going.
6917000	6921000	Say you don't go to a matinee, you're paying $12 for a ticket.
6921000	6926000	Food like popcorn and soda is probably going to run you at least $10.
6926000	6929000	I mean, that's $22 at least right there.
6929000	6932000	That's probably on the cheap side.
6932000	6935000	So that's almost the price of a blu-ray already.
6935000	6937000	If not, you know...
6937000	6938000	I don't know.
6938000	6941000	I miss Spider-Man in theaters.
6941000	6944000	And I know we miss Cars 3.
6944000	6948000	So I saw those on DVD the other day at the grocery store.
6948000	6953000	So I was like, well jeez, I better acquire this through digital means.
6953000	6957000	But anyway, my point is, people will still pay the premium to see it first.
6957000	6961000	Now granted, it could be, is it the big screen having an effect?
6961000	6962000	But I don't know.
6962000	6969000	Like, you know, now that we got 4K TVs with super good refresh rates, sometimes watching movies at home almost looks better.
6970000	6972000	You know, and I think people...
6972000	6977000	And eventually this might be a thing where people will pay a premium to like...
6977000	6983000	Almost like a pay-per-view type thing for like, see Star Wars live on TV.
6983000	6985000	But I think it's getting...
6985000	6987000	I think they've been playing with that a little bit.
6987000	6991000	There are still some movies that come out on demand and in theaters the same day.
6991000	6994000	But a lot of theaters, they give the finger to it.
6994000	7001000	Yeah right, and I think it's a delicate relationship between the movie studios and the theaters.
7001000	7007000	Because if they do that, that unfortunately will close a lot of theaters down if they're just...
7007000	7009000	You know, they're not exclusive anymore.
7009000	7017000	But, you know, for certain movies I'm like, I need to see that in the theater because it's just not gonna be the same watching it at home.
7019000	7020000	Alright.
7020000	7022000	Anyway, that's it for the mailbag this week.
7022000	7027000	If you guys want to send us an email for a future week, participate at orangeloungeradio.com.
7028000	7031000	Squatchkiller in a chat over at live.voguenetwork.com says,
7031000	7037000	Too expensive to take the whole family these days. I would rather watch a movie at home on a nice TV.
7037000	7038000	Yeah, I mean that's...
7038000	7041000	But the theater, the movie industry isn't dying.
7041000	7045000	I mean, I know a lot of people that feel very similar.
7045000	7047000	And especially, I'm sure, the bigger your family gets.
7047000	7049000	You know, a family of four is gonna be expensive.
7049000	7056000	If you have more than that, I mean, God, a $70 video game may actually be a cheaper form of entertainment than a night out of the movies.
7057000	7059000	But yet, the movie industry is thriving.
7059000	7066000	Well, Ian, you can't complain that, you know, the cost per hour of entertainment is gonna be definitely lower on a video game.
7066000	7067000	Sure.
7067000	7070000	Because you're gonna get, you know, hundreds of hours of entertainment out of that.
7070000	7071000	Maybe.
7071000	7073000	At the very least, you're gonna get more than two hours of entertainment.
7073000	7074000	Yeah, 20. We'll say 20 is the baseline.
7074000	7075000	At the very least.
7075000	7078000	So, you know, you're gonna save money that way.
7078000	7082000	But, like, even with my kids, like, I try taking them to the movies all the time.
7082000	7090000	But my youngest son, he's too little still to sit through a movie because he wants to crawl over the goddamn, all over the goddamn place.
7090000	7094000	Like, the last movie we saw was the Lego Ninjago movie.
7094000	7096000	He was fucking everywhere.
7096000	7098000	You need a movie theater with a seatbelt.
7098000	7103000	It's just like, they'll watch movies, like, they'll watch, like, they've been watching, they've been binge watching.
7103000	7105000	They picked the weirdest shit too.
7105000	7107000	The live action Scooby Doo movies.
7107000	7112000	Which, now that they've watched them so many times, aren't actually that bad.
7112000	7115000	They're stupid, but they're as stupid as the show was.
7115000	7119000	And for what they are, I think they're actually pretty well put together.
7119000	7121000	So, you know, props to them for that.
7121000	7124000	But, yes, it's a really stupid movie. They'll watch it dozens of times.
7127000	7130000	Don't those movies have, like, marijuana references all over them too?
7130000	7132000	Oh, God, yes. All the time.
7132000	7135000	And they have, like, all sorts of small references in there.
7135000	7140000	I love kid movies that have humor that only adults will get. That's, like, my favorite.
7140000	7144000	Yeah, they have, like, all sorts of weird shit, like, sexual, like, tension and shit like that in the second movie.
7144000	7146000	I mean, it's all over the place, but it's-
7146000	7148000	Between Velma and Daphne, right?
7148000	7151000	Oh, God, Velma, like, no, not even, like, Velma and Daphne.
7151000	7156000	Like, Velma and, like, Velma and Seth Green in the last movie, the second movie that they had.
7156000	7160000	But, like, it's, they've got, like, big name stars in it.
7160000	7165000	It's just, like, I don't know. It's all right. It's not as irritating as I thought it would be.
7165000	7166000	All right.
7168000	7172000	You should do quick movie reviews for VOG. It's not as irritating as I thought it would be.
7172000	7175000	No, seriously, there's some movies, like, seriously, like, you would think.
7175000	7180000	The Angry Birds movie. That sounds like a shitty fucking idea. It was actually an irritating movie.
7180000	7186000	Maybe my standards are just lowering that much because I've been forced to watch all these kids' shows.
7186000	7190000	Loki's review of Angry Birds, the movie. I thought it would be shitty, but it was actually pretty good.
7190000	7194000	It was actually kind of funny. They had a lot of adult humor in there.
7194000	7200000	And also, Bill Hader does voice acting, so I love Bill Hader. Can't hate on the hater.
7200000	7206000	All right. Let's see if we can hate on the gaming news. I hope not. There's too much hate out there in the gaming industry.
7206000	7207000	Yes, we can, actually.
7207000	7212000	Oh, yeah. Now that I just looked up and saw what the first story was, I was like, oops.
7212000	7214000	God, I put my foot in my mouth so bad.
7214000	7224000	Yes, because this week, if it wasn't about Star Wars and the shitty DLC, it was about, hey, which celebrity is sexually harassing someone now?
7224000	7231000	Or, hey, let's tie it back in the game industry. IGN. There's, you know, drama going on there.
7231000	7238000	Apparently, there's, you know, some former employees that have sexually harassed people and some shenanigans that are going on there.
7238000	7251000	So, you know, basically, they're saying, you know, that they put out a statement saying that there won't be a daily fix today because a large number of groups of IGN employees have refused to work until the company issues a statement.
7251000	7259000	I apologize regarding what happened to, was it Kaley Plague? I think that's how you say the name.
7259000	7268000	Saying basically referring to a former coworker who, I guess on Friday, had accused the company of an HR department mistreating her.
7268000	7270000	And so that's their daily show.
7270000	7284000	They were saying that apparently that they, she had to deal with, I guess, someone that was making, you know, more and more uncomfortable sexually, sexual nature comments to her.
7284000	7291000	And basically that kind of sounded like the HR department was kind of trying to brush it under the rug type thing.
7292000	7303000	Just, you know, with the whole Harvey Weinstein thing, everybody's coming out about this stuff. And I'm not surprised. It's everywhere. It's all industries have shitty people in it.
7303000	7310000	You're not going to find an industry that does not have shitty people in it. And it's just like, God, I hope it's not this person that I really like.
7310000	7318000	I mean, they had like George Takei, you had, oh God, what's the Senator's name? Al Franken.
7318000	7324000	Al Franken, you know, they've had lots of different actors that have had...
7324000	7325000	Turn on a television.
7325000	7328000	Yeah, I mean, it's just all over the place. Every day, it's something, you know.
7328000	7338000	Well, unfortunately, this is a result in this whole like garbage parade that's happening right now. And I mean, garbage people being paraded out of these different jobs.
7339000	7348000	What's happening here is a result of an industry, especially Hollywood, where this shit's been bottled up way too long.
7348000	7349000	Oh, God, yeah.
7349000	7351000	Collectively, yeah. People are putting their foot down things.
7351000	7355000	We're just scratching the surface on like the skeletons in the closet in that industry. Oh, God.
7355000	7365000	And obviously, everything Hollywood bleeds into video games here and there. And it's really not escapable, unfortunately, in any industry.
7365000	7373000	So, I mean, you're seeing just now, you know, the result of people coming together, putting their collective foot down and saying, we're not taking this shit anymore.
7373000	7381000	You know, which also leads to some questions about how much evidence do we need to convict a person?
7381000	7387000	You know, it's one thing when it's Kevin Spacey and there's, you know, 40 people all lined up to talk about an issue.
7388000	7397000	But then you got George Kay where it's one. And that's my thing. It's hard. I don't think there's an easy answer to that scenario at all.
7397000	7403000	And that's my thing, too. And I don't think I've ever put anything out regarding this, but this is basically my opinion on this scenario.
7403000	7409000	It's not that I want to distrust everybody, but I question everything I read. I question everything because you have to.
7409000	7421000	Because there's been so many scenarios, not to say that there's not guilty people out there, but there's been so many scenarios where someone is accused of something.
7421000	7431000	It could be like something sexual assault or sexual abuse or something like that. It comes out, find out later that, oh, it was actually made up and the damages are even done.
7432000	7438000	Whereas, you know, these people, I agree, people should be coming forward with this stuff, especially if it's happening.
7438000	7444000	But we shouldn't be so quickly to jump on board and judge these people without having all the facts.
7444000	7450000	And that's kind of where my issue is, is I'm seeing a lot more people coming out, which is great.
7450000	7452000	I think more people should come out and bring a lot of this stuff to light.
7452000	7458000	But I'm worried that people are going to get, find, be opportunistic about it and find out.
7458000	7466000	Because with the Al Franken thing, don't get me wrong, it seems like it's a stretch. He took full responsibility for it as well.
7466000	7473000	But it seems very political because the person making the accusation is very much affiliated with the conservative movement.
7473000	7480000	And it's just very kind of the timing of the thing is kind of convenient, but convenient with what's going on with Roy Moore.
7480000	7482000	Sure. Right. It's just very convenient.
7482000	7495000	So I'm worried that we're going to see more of these things coming out where it's more to kind of attack a person because, well, we don't want to not believe somebody because then you look bad if you don't believe them.
7495000	7508000	But I just argue that we should at least show some sort of caution with believing everything that we read until we know all the facts or have more corroborating evidence or something like that.
7509000	7518000	And this goes for any side. For someone defending themselves and someone making the accusations, we need to know all the facts before we can kind of judge a person.
7518000	7524000	And not to get too far off topic, but obviously this is a topic that's consumed a lot of the media, as you said recently.
7524000	7535000	I think we all have to kind of look at this. And I think if we all kind of look at this and go, this is a shitty world. This is not the type of environment.
7535000	7544000	This is not the type of humanity that we want to be. I think we all have to make a conversation and say, no more. And it starts with you make a conscious effort.
7544000	7552000	I'm not going to sexually harass somebody. I'm going to teach my children and the people that I influence not to sexually harass people.
7552000	7559000	And I think that's where it starts. And that's where we're going to have to build this better future because unfortunately we can't fix what's happened in years and years of Hollywood.
7559000	7563000	We're not going to be able to go back and undo that because that shit does permanent damage.
7563000	7567000	All we can do is we have to make this better for the next generation.
7567000	7575000	Or make it easier for people to come forward instead of learning about it 40 years later or, you know, several years later about something that happened in the past.
7575000	7584000	Find out about it now so we can stop it now instead of, oh, I can't speak up because I'm afraid this will hurt my career or something like that.
7584000	7587000	Although that's a valid, I mean, we understand why people feel that way.
7588000	7598000	Let's move on. We got way off topic, but understandably so it is something that's, you know, spilling into the gaming industry, unfortunately.
7598000	7609000	So, um, you know, just, you need to stop this culture and, uh, it's not cool or any of that stuff, you know, it needs to stop.
7609000	7617000	All right, moving on. Let's talk about movies, but the type of movie news we like to talk about, and that is video games becoming movies.
7617000	7619000	Well, do we like to talk about that? Because usually it doesn't end well.
7619000	7623000	Well, there's Rampage as a trailer for that, so...
7623000	7626000	I wasn't feeling the Rampage trailer.
7626000	7629000	I thought it could, I thought, well...
7629000	7633000	For me, it still goes back to the question of why do we need this?
7633000	7641000	Well, the problem like with that movie, at least the trailer, is it didn't seem like it barely tied in with the whole game as it was.
7641000	7646000	Which I guess is fine. A lot of those 80s games don't exactly have the biggest plot anyway.
7646000	7651000	But we also have Battleship turned out, which also doesn't have much of a plot to the game.
7651000	7654000	And then the new Jumanji that's coming out, both also starring The Rock.
7654000	7658000	What the fuck is with The Rock and being on The Rock? He's rocking the schlock.
7658000	7661000	I mean, I don't know why he's in all these.
7661000	7668000	And this movie right here, it's funny because he did a movie just recently called San Andreas, which was kind of schlocky as well.
7668000	7671000	And it looks very similar to that.
7671000	7675000	And... I don't know. I mean...
7675000	7681000	I'll be interested to hear how it turns out. I just, I don't, I wish it was more like the story of the game.
7681000	7686000	Well, anyhow, we actually weren't going to talk about the Rampage thing, but there you go.
7686000	7692000	But I did want to talk about that it looks like a new Mario Brothers movie is going to be attempted.
7692000	7698000	So we're just going to forget the whole, you know, Dennis Hopper as King Koopa thing never existed.
7698000	7699000	I can never forget that, though.
7699000	7701000	We're just going to kind of erase that.
7701000	7707000	Because now they're talking about an animated film and it's going to come from Universal Animation.
7707000	7712000	Not too outside the realm of possibility because Universal, we know, has already teamed up for the theme park stuff, right?
7712000	7716000	So it makes sense that if any film studio is going to have dibs on this, it's probably Universal, right?
7716000	7724000	Universal Animation in talks to make this. Universal Animation, of course, behind Shrek and the Minions.
7726000	7729000	Which takes me back to a quote from The Good Place.
7729000	7731000	I won this little yellow demon.
7731000	7747000	The Minions, you know, honestly, like having watched the Minions movies several dozen times now, it honestly is very well animated and the story isn't all that bad.
7747000	7754000	If there's going to be a studio that has to do it, good choice. I see no problem with this.
7754000	7758000	There's a really good friend of mine, and I'm not going to say who on air.
7758000	7764000	There's a really good friend of mine. The way I feel about mayonnaise is the way he feels about Minions.
7764000	7771000	They're not really, I mean, it's a silly movie. Yes, the characters are forced out of their throats because they're fucking everywhere.
7771000	7779000	But it's not that, I mean, if you actually watch the movies, it's not that annoying. They're actually pretty entertaining.
7780000	7788000	It's silly, like the whole Minions thing, like the Minions movie was set more like, it's kind of that like, oh.
7788000	7793000	My friend is not alone. Fifth Dream in chat says, can't fucking stand Minions.
7793000	7799000	I don't know, it wasn't that bad. Alright, alright, alright. Anyway, film reviews by Loki. It wasn't that bad.
7799000	7807000	Anyhow, there you go. So that's all we know. This is according to a Wall Street Journal report saying Nintendo and Universal are close to signing the deal.
7808000	7811000	Which would kind of be a step in a different direction.
7811000	7815000	Weren't they close to signing a deal with Sony at one time? I mean, I don't know.
7815000	7820000	But, you know, Nintendo has kind of said they're not going to license their properties for movies anymore.
7820000	7826000	But, you know, as the years go by. It's been a while. It's been a while and, you know, why not?
7826000	7830000	If the script is really good, maybe animated is a good place for that to be.
7830000	7834000	I'd be curious who they get to do the voices. Do you think they'd get Charles Martin native voice Mario? I doubt it.
7834000	7835000	I hope so.
7835000	7840000	Unfortunately, and no disrespect to Mr. Charles Martinet who is a fantastic voice acting talent.
7840000	7844000	The unfortunate thing is, his name on the poster, most people don't know who that is.
7844000	7850000	They're going to put, they're going to cast somebody like Bill Hader or whoever it is you like.
7850000	7852000	It's going to be like a Saturday Night Live comic.
7852000	7858000	If Bill Hader wants to do it, he probably could do it. And I'm, Bill Hader can do no wrong.
7858000	7865000	I'm sorry. It's like he's hilarious. He's a great comedy. He's a great comedy writer and he does great voices and impressions.
7865000	7871000	So, I have no problem with him doing all of the voices, some of the voices. I think he'd be great.
7871000	7877000	But no, I'm sure they'll get somebody to do Mario's voice. Millions of people can do Mario's voice.
7877000	7881000	Hopefully, Charles Martinet gets to do a cameo somewhere, do a voice. That would be very nice.
7881000	7887000	I don't know why he wouldn't be like considered. I mean, they probably at least have him try out.
7887000	7892000	Yeah, we'll see. Who knows? Do you hear Mr. Smoosh? He snores when he sleeps.
7892000	7896000	It's so adorable. Did you hear that?
7896000	7898000	Sort of, yeah.
7900000	7901000	He's so cute.
7901000	7902000	It's that squished up nose.
7902000	7903000	Yeah, it is. It is.
7903000	7905000	All right. Anyhow, moving on. Loki.
7907000	7909000	You can hear it, right? It's like super loud.
7909000	7911000	I don't want to wake him up. Oh, he's awake.
7911000	7912000	It happens.
7912000	7914000	I'm going to try to pick it up on the...
7914000	7915000	That's what cats do.
7915000	7922000	All right. Anyways, so HTC announced that they're going to be doing a standalone headset called the Vive Focus.
7922000	7930000	It's going to basically be like the Oculus headset that they have coming out where it doesn't require a PC or phone.
7930000	7938000	It's just a headset. It's also very blue looking, which I don't really care for that, but whatevs.
7938000	7945000	Apparently, they're saying that they're going to be available only in China initially.
7945000	7950000	They're not really seeing what the pricing is going to be or anything like that.
7950000	7956000	However, because of this, they're not going to be working with Google, though, on a standalone Daydream headset.
7956000	7966000	But it will, I guess, apparently work similar to the Vive headset now where it does room scale and all that.
7966000	7973000	So it'll be interesting to see how much that is and what the games and applications look like on that.
7973000	7977000	I don't know. I'm still worried about these standalone headsets.
7977000	7980000	But I'll check it out.
7980000	7984000	VR's got to catch on in the mainstream one of these times.
7984000	7987000	Getting the cost down is the way to do it, though.
7987000	7994000	It is. And it's funny. I was watching a review on the Acer mixed reality headset that they have,
7994000	8001000	which mixed reality sounds like it's going to be some augmented reality thing, but it's actually just a VR headset that's for $399.
8001000	8006000	And originally, their thing was, oh, well, our headset's going to be $399. That's what's going to make it sell.
8006000	8013000	But then Oculus dropped the price of their headset back in August, and it's like, why is this thing even coming out now?
8013000	8022000	But I guess the headset quality isn't quite up to what some of these other headsets are.
8022000	8029000	So I'm more interested in seeing what the next generation of these headsets are going to be come maybe even next year.
8029000	8033000	I don't know. Soon? Next couple of years?
8033000	8036000	Soon.
8036000	8043000	All right. Well, this website won't work for this story I'm trying to do live.
8043000	8048000	I can Google it from somewhere else, but I wanted to talk about what's going to be playable at PlayStation Expo.
8048000	8049000	OK, let's talk about it.
8049000	8053000	So PlayStation Expo got quite a few different exhibitors.
8053000	8057000	So starting off with the titles that are going to be there.
8057000	8059000	Let's see, do they have it's just listing all the titles.
8059000	8063000	So I'm assuming these are all playable.
8063000	8067000	So let's see, starting off, we've got 20XX.
8067000	8069000	OK, we're not reading this entire list.
8069000	8071000	There's too many. Wait, I'm going to I finally got a list here.
8071000	8075000	I'm going to look through it. It does look like there's quite a list of games there.
8075000	8077000	But that's a 20XX. That game is fun.
8077000	8080000	That's coming out for PlayStation 4. I didn't even know that. That's great.
8080000	8082000	I did a live stream of that a while ago.
8082000	8086000	This is kind of neat. Aegis Defenders, which apparently is a Humble Bundle game.
8086000	8089000	Because they're publishing stuff now.
8089000	8091000	The first expansion to Destiny 2 is going to be there.
8091000	8095000	DJ Max Respect, which I've been waiting to hear about a North American release for that.
8095000	8098000	For you music game fans, that'll be fun.
8098000	8105000	Brawlhalla Fantasy Strike, Street Fighter V Arcade Edition.
8105000	8107000	Gran Turismo Sport.
8107000	8110000	Yakuza 6, The Song of Life.
8110000	8114000	I don't know why, but they're putting all those Uncharted games still out on the floor to play.
8114000	8116000	Because why not? It's Sony show.
8116000	8118000	Monster Hunter World.
8118000	8120000	Shadow of the Colossus.
8120000	8121000	That'd be really cool.
8121000	8123000	People waiting to check that out.
8123000	8125000	Sounds like it's going to be a fun show.
8125000	8128000	I wish I had room to do one more expo this year.
8128000	8131000	But I just can't. I'm out of PTO and all that.
8131000	8133000	Maybe if I hadn't done the Seattle trip.
8133000	8136000	I don't regret doing that. It was a real relaxing time.
8136000	8139000	And then I'm looking at the VR titles that they have here.
8142000	8144000	Ungrave looks kind of neat.
8146000	8148000	I don't know what half these are.
8148000	8151000	Why do they have Resident Evil 7 Biohazard as a VR title?
8151000	8154000	I mean, it's one of the better titles on VR.
8154000	8156000	Maybe they're adding something to it.
8156000	8159000	You'll be almost a year old by then.
8160000	8165000	Honestly, put on Until Dawn Rush of Blood.
8165000	8167000	Because that game is fucking awesome.
8167000	8169000	Everybody can just download that to their own system now.
8169000	8171000	It's so good. I mean, seriously.
8171000	8175000	If you haven't played it yet, go play it. It's awesome.
8176000	8181000	Let's get to the next news story and get to the calls soon at Orange Lounge Radio.
8181000	8183000	All one word on Skype.
8183000	8185000	We have a couple more stories first though.
8185000	8189000	Ubisoft, I guess, can kind of breathe a little bit.
8189000	8196000	Because, apparently, Vividi has said that they're not going to try to take over Ubisoft for at least six months.
8196000	8199000	So, Vividi has released their third quarter financials.
8199000	8210000	And, apparently, they're saying that they do not expect to attempt a takeover of Ubisoft until the next half of the financial year.
8210000	8216000	And, I guess, right now they own 26% in Ubisoft.
8216000	8229000	And, I guess, they're saying due to a French accounting law, purchasing another 4% of the company triggers a requirement for Vividi to either purchase the video game publisher or to back off.
8229000	8236000	So, they're anticipating that Ubisoft granted double voting rights to the majority shareholders.
8240000	8247000	It'll be interesting to see what happens because I know the last company that they purchased didn't end up doing too well.
8249000	8252000	Yeah, people were not a fan of this whole takeover news either.
8252000	8255000	So, I don't know why they're still trying it.
8255000	8258000	But, I guess, at the end of the day, it doesn't matter what we think. It matters what investors think.
8258000	8260000	It's all about money. It's always money.
8260000	8262000	It's all about the investors and money. It's all about that.
8262000	8266000	Well, you know what gamers love to end on this note tonight?
8266000	8268000	Gamers love rumors!
8268000	8273000	That's right. We've got so many rumors to talk about here at the end of the show.
8273000	8276000	But, that's why I'm putting it at the end of the show because it is just rumors.
8276000	8279000	Who knows if it's going to be true or not.
8279000	8284000	This comes from Reddit via a member Das Vergben, if I said that right.
8284000	8287000	Apparently, a lot of news and rumors.
8287000	8290000	Now, why do we care about what some rando on Reddit has to say?
8290000	8299000	Apparently, this same person called the Ninja Turtles in Injustice 2 thing, which I don't think anybody could have predicted.
8299000	8305000	So, that's why suddenly these rumors are getting a little more credit.
8305000	8311000	But, what do we think? We're going to measure these on the plausibility scale.
8311000	8313000	Is it plausible or not?
8314000	8322000	Number one, a Switch port of Dragon Ball FighterZ is in the works and will likely come out in fall and winter of 2018.
8322000	8324000	I guess.
8324000	8329000	I say yes, the Switch is doing very well. This makes a lot of sense for this to happen.
8329000	8336000	Soul Calibur 6 is in development for the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and PC.
8336000	8339000	It's going to be unveiled at the PlayStation Experience.
8339000	8343000	Link will return as a guest character on the Switch version.
8343000	8348000	I mean, if it's going to come out on the Switch, then I would see Link as being a character.
8348000	8351000	It's kind of boring, though.
8351000	8355000	No, Link is a guest character. He's been a guest character on every...
8355000	8360000	Yeah, but Soul Calibur 2 is so awesome with him.
8360000	8363000	I mean, the GameCube version of that was the must-have.
8363000	8366000	I would hope that they have more guest characters than just one, how about that?
8366000	8370000	Well, the interesting thing, though, about... I mean, one thing you got to point out, there was Soul Calibur 6.
8370000	8372000	No Xbox in that.
8372000	8375000	And who knows if that's online play, although they...
8375000	8378000	Sony's the one that's holding out on that now, so I don't know if maybe...
8378000	8380000	Yeah, I doubt it would be online play.
8380000	8384000	Maybe they're agreeing to do it with Nintendo and just not Microsoft.
8384000	8389000	Or the fact that the game is, you know, Japanese-developed and Microsoft's a non-factor in Japan now.
8389000	8391000	So, it'll be interesting.
8391000	8395000	But, I mean, I would think a sixth Soul Calibur has to happen at some point.
8395000	8398000	So, that alone seems like, yeah, that would make a lot of sense.
8398000	8400000	That would be a cool game to reveal.
8400000	8405000	Especially with, you know, a lot of people really into Tekken 7 right now.
8405000	8411000	I'd be curious who would be the guest characters on the other platforms.
8411000	8414000	PC and Sony.
8414000	8420000	Would they just go back and do Heihachi again on PlayStation and then maybe Spawn moves to PC?
8420000	8425000	Instead of being Microsoft? Well, which I guess, well, in a way, PC is Microsoft, so...
8425000	8426000	Who knows?
8426000	8431000	I don't know if they'd do Spawn. Who even likes Spawn nowadays?
8431000	8436000	Bob Coffee says, not gonna happen. Not until Harada is done with Tekken 7.
8436000	8437000	Alright.
8437000	8440000	Whatever happened to Tekken Cross Street Fighter? Is that ever gonna happen?
8440000	8442000	Yeah, whatever happened to that?
8442000	8448000	There has been pressure on Game Freak to get Pokemon's 8th generation out in hopes of a release next year.
8448000	8459000	If you recall Pokemon Stars, that is or was real, but all it was was a Sun and Moon port to the Switch used as an engine test tech demo thing.
8459000	8461000	In my opinion, that's a whole lot of nothing.
8461000	8464000	That there's really nothing that can be amounted from that.
8464000	8468000	Because the new Pokemon game might be out next year.
8468000	8471000	Of course they're gonna try to push to get it out next year. Why wouldn't they?
8471000	8477000	But as far as there's this tech demo thing that may or may not actually exist, I don't think we'll ever know on that one.
8477000	8480000	So there's really a whole lot of nothing with that.
8480000	8487000	Metroid Prime 4 should have something revealed with in-game footage early next year.
8487000	8494000	Direct in January, Bandai Namco is developing the game for Nintendo.
8494000	8497000	Unknown which development studio?
8497000	8502000	That's a pretty big one. Bandai Namco could actually be developing the game for Nintendo.
8502000	8503000	Hmm.
8503000	8506000	What do you think? Plausible? Not plausible.
8506000	8510000	We'll see something eventually. Probably by E3 next year.
8510000	8516000	I think this is a very safe bet, but I think January may be too early for a direct on that.
8516000	8521000	Okay, hold on, because Mr. Smoosh is scratching the couch. I don't want him to scratch the couch.
8521000	8523000	Stop scratching the couch. Alright.
8523000	8525000	Let's cut the nails off and then you won't have that problem.
8525000	8526000	No, I'm not gonna declaw the kitty.
8526000	8528000	No, you don't declaw the kitty, just...
8528000	8530000	Oh, oh, file the nails. Yeah.
8530000	8533000	I'm trying to get him to use the scratching post to do that.
8533000	8537000	Yeah, I know. We're gonna have to... or get him those little nail holder things.
8537000	8540000	I have to look into how, you know, if...
8540000	8543000	I just trim my cat's nails. Usually it's because she uses it on me.
8543000	8549000	And so when she's laying on me, she needs and it's like, stop clawing into my arm.
8549000	8551000	Like, I'll look at my arm and there's like scratches all down it.
8551000	8555000	See, Sanrio was very good about using the scratching post, so she never really had a problem.
8555000	8558000	But I think we might be challenged a little bit with this one.
8558000	8559000	That's alright.
8559000	8562000	Sorry I keep talking about the cat, but it's brand new.
8562000	8564000	He just got here yesterday.
8564000	8565000	And it doesn't hide from us.
8565000	8568000	You know, the kitty doesn't hide from us. All kitty wants to be here front and center.
8568000	8571000	If we ever do go video, you're gonna see him through the whole show.
8571000	8574000	Alright, let's see. What else do we have here?
8574000	8578000	Mother 3 is real. It was localized and playable.
8578000	8584000	It is being held back for some reason, which all I know has something to do with not knowing which month to release it in.
8584000	8587000	That sounds not plausible.
8587000	8588000	That sounds like a whole bunch of bullshit.
8588000	8596000	It does. Because, okay, sure, Mother 3 is maybe done, probably done, tested, but this whole, they don't know what month to release it in?
8596000	8597000	What?
8597000	8598000	That's bullshit.
8598000	8600000	I don't believe that part.
8600000	8603000	Let's see. And lastly, here's another big one.
8603000	8607000	Blizzard is preparing a Hearthstone port for the Switch.
8607000	8609000	I heard about this when I went to Blizzcon.
8609000	8614000	I guess it's plausible. Unity ports to the Switch, so why not?
8614000	8622000	It might die down some of the people that want Overwatch to come to the Switch if Blizzard does support the Switch with Hearthstone.
8622000	8630000	It makes sense for the Switch more than other platforms because of the touchscreen, which, you know, it does with mobile.
8630000	8635000	I don't know. I guess it makes sense if that's, yeah.
8635000	8636000	It's something it would be able to run.
8636000	8642000	Although it does seem a little fan wanky to me, but I think it would be a good idea.
8642000	8645000	I think that could be a win-win situation, but we'll see.
8645000	8646000	So.
8646000	8651000	Alright, and Bobby Blackwolf says, all Blizzard needs to put out on the Switch is rock and roll racing.
8651000	8653000	Alright, there you go for rumors this week.
8653000	8654000	Let's get to the Skype line.
8654000	8657000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
8657000	8665000	If you want to give us a call and share your thoughts on anything we've talked about or maybe haven't gotten around to yet on the news this week.
8665000	8669000	I'm gonna ask Loki over there if he has any last minute stories that he wants to get to.
8669000	8670000	I don't.
8670000	8671000	Uh oh.
8671000	8674000	I gotta buy time here somehow.
8674000	8678000	Is there any games that you're hoping to pick up during this holiday season?
8678000	8681000	I'd be curious to see what's on sale on the Steam sales and stuff.
8681000	8686000	I really have a huge backlog, though, and I'm very aware of that.
8686000	8694000	If anything, it may be the South Park game, but I'm really trying not to pick up too many games because I buy them and then I don't end up playing them.
8695000	8701000	I want to finish the LEGO game right now just so that my kids can play the free mode because that's really all they want to play.
8701000	8706000	They're not good at cooperating, so I can't have them play the actual game.
8709000	8710000	I don't know.
8710000	8717000	Maybe I'd like to still get LEGO Dimensions, but it's really fucking expensive and it's still hard to find that stuff.
8719000	8721000	It's hard to find the LEGO Dimensions stuff now?
8721000	8722000	It is.
8722000	8723000	They don't sell it anymore.
8723000	8725000	I guess a lot of places must have unloaded it.
8725000	8727000	A lot of places have unloaded it or they haven't worked it down.
8727000	8730000	One more shout out for the Skype line, OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype.
8731000	8738000	And then, of course, you know, I have to work on developing my game because I haven't been doing that for weeks now.
8738000	8740000	Hey, the phones are lighting up, so let's get to it.
8740000	8742000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
8742000	8743000	Yo, what's up, guys? This is SkyJudo.
8743000	8745000	Hey, SkyJudo. What's up, buddy?
8745000	8751000	I want to talk about the email that you got. I can't remember the person's name, sorry, but they were talking about the digital versus physical.
8751000	8753000	I believe that was Retertainment.
8753000	8761000	All right, well, for a long time, I've been somebody who's always said, you know, buy physical. I don't want to deal with digital.
8761000	8767000	And one of the main reasons is because I notice how much space a lot of these games take up on your hard drive.
8767000	8778000	And now I'm kind of flipping a little bit because I feel like digital and physical are like one and the same now because they all download to your hard drive now.
8779000	8784000	So you're not really saving, in my case, I'm not really saving any space on my hard drive.
8784000	8792000	So normally I just go with digital just because I'm like, I notice that some of my games I like the most, that I play the most, like, what is it?
8792000	8800000	Fight Night Champions on Xbox 360. That thing has like a little crack in the center of the disc.
8800000	8808000	And I'm just like, you know, I've noticed this with my other games, so I'm like, why even bother with a game that's going to crack, get scratched up when I can just go digital, have it there?
8808000	8812000	Because it's basically going to take up the same amount of space that it would if I had it on disc.
8812000	8817000	Like the only games I will buy now are like games that I want a physical copy, like I want to collect them, whatever.
8817000	8822000	Like I just got the Pokemon Ultra Sun and Moon. That I would never get digital.
8822000	8828000	I always get the, you know, I love having a little, you know, a little cartridge, put them with the rest of my collection, that type of thing.
8828000	8835000	You know, there's some other games like that for PlayStation 4 and the other like CD systems, but I'm finding myself buying a lot more digital now.
8835000	8840000	Yeah, you know, I don't know. I still tend to do physical and a lot of that is because of price.
8840000	8849000	And because I do have Amazon Prime, which they sure don't warn you when your year's about up on that because my thing got charged for that all of a sudden.
8849000	8854000	I was like, when did it go up to like a hundred bucks? But I'll still use it throughout the year.
8854000	8862000	So with the shipping and the Twitch Prime and everything that comes with it, but one other thing that you get is the discount on newer games.
8862000	8866000	So honestly, I get physical games cheaper because I buy them through Amazon Prime.
8866000	8868000	So it's actually cheaper if you need to get it than digital.
8868000	8875000	Are you really getting them? I mean, because like I don't do a lot of online shopping. Like I go right into the GameStop, pick up my game that way.
8875000	8883000	So are you really saving that much money or are you basically spending around the same price that you would normally spend if you just walk into a store and physically bought it?
8883000	8886000	Twenty percent is what I'm saving. So...
8886000	8889000	With the shipping and handling and all that stuff, because I know the shipping gets crazy.
8889000	8892000	No, if you have Amazon Prime, you're not paying anything.
8892000	8899000	Well, it's a double-edged sword. You're paying the hundred bucks for Amazon Prime, but you never pay shipping for anything throughout the year.
8899000	8908000	And I take it that you buy a lot of games, but you're not just buying like games a year or something. I guess it pays for you.
8908000	8916000	It does, yeah. For me, it ends up paying for itself. And then I get the Amazon TV and the Twitch stuff and everything else they have involved with that.
8916000	8921000	But to be fair, I know a lot of people have been having problems with Amazon, like serious problems.
8921000	8926000	We heard Act Deft call in a couple weeks ago with him getting fucked around on the SNES Classic.
8926000	8933000	So Amazon is not infallible. So far for me, I've never had a problem with them, knock on wood.
8934000	8940000	But what if Amazon's not around anymore? How do you see yourself purchasing your games?
8940000	8950000	Like, if you had to go the route that I'm going where I'm walking in the store and getting it, or I'm buying it off of my PlayStation or something like that, what would you do?
8950000	8955000	I would still probably shop around a little bit for the best special.
8955000	8958000	Right. No, I'm joking.
8985000	8988000	I remember the last time I bought a physical PC release.
8988000	8991000	Good luck trying to buy a physical PC release.
8991000	8999000	Nowadays, if you buy a physical PC release, a lot of times they just come with a Steam code inside of it. What's the point?
8999000	9003000	But it is worth saying, I do buy digital when it's PC.
9004000	9016000	One of my prized possessions is I have a freaking Torchlight. I got it on disc somehow. I didn't even know this game was on disc. I just found it in a freaking basket at GameStop.
9016000	9021000	I just found a hidden gem. You rarely see any PC games on the shelf.
9021000	9027000	Unfortunately, the value of that's about to go up with the whole studio getting closed, which is a bummer.
9027000	9034000	I don't think I would ever sell it. I love Torchlight. I was just surprised I actually had a physical copy of it because I had already bought it off of Steam.
9034000	9042000	With the physical, I think they gave me a ferret or something, so you get a different animal with the CD version.
9042000	9046000	There you go. See, it's all about what little extras, what little extra things are there.
9047000	9055000	For me, it's taking up space. That's my whole thing, preserving space on my hard drive. Now I'm glad at the PlayStation 4 you can use an external hard drive.
9055000	9059000	That's always been my main issue with the physical thing.
9061000	9064000	Thanks for taking my call. I'll let some more people get in.
9064000	9067000	Good question. That was a good topic. Take care, my friend.
9067000	9069000	Bye, man.
9069000	9072000	OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype, if you want to give us a call.
9083000	9087000	Yeah, I have friends that do the Best Buy thing, and they really like it.
9087000	9094000	I haven't been convinced to get it because I kind of feel like, well, Amazon matches it for all but amiibos, really.
9095000	9102000	The only amiibo I've bought in the past few months is that Princess Peach amiibo, and I bought that amiibo for one specific reason.
9103000	9105000	That it's a well-made amiibo.
9105000	9113000	MXC in chat says, visual novels get a surprising amount of physical PC releases, often still with a disc and a downloadable key.
9113000	9116000	There's a lot of physical collectors in the fandom.
9116000	9119000	That's true. There are still some physical PC releases.
9119000	9125000	There's so much that's digitally done because the storefronts like Steam and Humble and so forth.
9125000	9131000	Last call for any phone calls tonight, OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype.
9131000	9135000	I can't believe we're about, what, a month away from the holidays. Crazy.
9136000	9140000	We are planning on being here for all the shows throughout December.
9140000	9143000	I forgot to look at what day the holidays fall on this year.
9143000	9147000	I want to say Christmas Eve might have been a Sunday coming up. I got to look at my calendar again.
9147000	9152000	Yeah, Christmas Eve is a Sunday this year, so I don't necessarily know when to do a show that night.
9153000	9159000	But I'm going to hope, because New Year's Eve will be on a Sunday too, and I am not going to want to do a show on New Year's Eve.
9159000	9165000	Sorry guys, I know a countdown show would be fun, but hopefully we can maybe do a show at a different day in the week.
9165000	9167000	That might be what we end up doing.
9167000	9169000	What about earlier in the day?
9169000	9170000	On New Year's Eve?
9170000	9175000	I could be talked into that if Jamie wants to do that too, because I don't really think I'll go out of town.
9175000	9181000	Maybe that could be a day we do a show timed for overseas folks, because we've talked about doing that for a while.
9181000	9182000	Like, do a noon show.
9182000	9183000	Yeah, that'd be fun.
9183000	9184000	Yeah, that'd be fun.
9184000	9186000	Besides, don't we...
9186000	9188000	Maybe see if Bobby wants to do it, not him.
9188000	9193000	I don't remember when we decided that we're doing this, but don't we have a time capsule to open?
9193000	9197000	We do. That'll be the New Year's Eve show, probably, at the end of the year.
9198000	9200000	We do have the time capsule.
9200000	9202000	Honestly, I forgot what's in it.
9202000	9204000	I forgot what's in it too.
9204000	9206000	I don't even remember what the fucking prompt was for that time.
9206000	9208000	I think it was just like, end of the year predictions.
9208000	9210000	We should probably have written down on a piece of paper.
9210000	9212000	I remember we were already getting tweets like,
9212000	9216000	Really? You're doing end of the year predictions? Like six months into the year?
9216000	9219000	That is the attention span of gamers.
9219000	9224000	I could go back and listen to the episode and I'd hear everything that's in there, but that would defeat the fun.
9224000	9227000	Look, even in the chat, DarkTit2e is like, Oh yeah.
9227000	9230000	And S2100matt's like, I forgot as well.
9232000	9234000	Alright.
9234000	9238000	So yeah, we will open it on the New Year's Eve show.
9238000	9244000	Whether we do that on New Year's Eve or we do it a couple days before to allow our host to have the whole day off.
9244000	9248000	We'll see. I need to talk to Miss Sakura about that one.
9248000	9253000	But, I feel like earlier in the day on New Year's Eve will probably work for everybody.
9253000	9255000	I think that'll be a lot of fun.
9255000	9258000	So, anyhow, that is going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.
9258000	9261000	Thank you guys so much for listening to our show tonight.
9261000	9265000	If you enjoyed what you heard here at the show, or even if you didn't, but you know somebody who might like it,
9265000	9268000	tell a friend or two or fifty about the show.
9268000	9271000	Help us spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,
9271000	9274000	but only if the gamers are here to share their voices.
9274000	9277000	We really appreciate a five star review wherever you found this podcast,
9277000	9281000	especially places like iTunes, Android, all those go a long way,
9281000	9287000	especially if you write a little blurb that's like, Rob is great, Jamie is awesome, Loki is okay.
9287000	9291000	Those five star reviews go a long, long way. We really appreciate it.
9291000	9295000	And, yeah, tell a friend. That's all we ask.
9295000	9298000	Thank you to our live crowd for being here, live Sunday nights.
9298000	9301000	Thank you to our podcast crowd for listening to us throughout the week.
9301000	9303000	We appreciate you both.
9303000	9306000	Thank you so much for being here and supporting independent podcasting.
9306000	9311000	Even if you didn't like this show, we hope you'll support some independent podcaster that's out there.
9311000	9315000	Because Mr. Smoosh told you to, didn't he? Didn't he, Mr. Smoosh?
9315000	9318000	Alright, let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
9318000	9320000	Loki, your final thought tonight?
9320000	9327000	My final thought is, hopefully we'll play my VR games this week, because I have a backlog of them.
9327000	9329000	And there's so many to play.
9329000	9333000	And then my final thought for tonight is, I hope I get more sleep tonight,
9333000	9338000	and Mr. Smoosh doesn't keep me up late like he did last night, jumping up on the bed and stuff.
9338000	9341000	But that's the joys of having a cat now that's a lot younger.
9341000	9343000	Three years is what the vet estimates.
9343000	9350000	Three years old as opposed to a seventeen year old that couldn't give a single solitary fuck about trying to jump up on anything.
9350000	9352000	So, there you go.
9352000	9354000	He knows. He knows.
9354000	9357000	Like, the minute he started snoring, I was like, oh god, I wish I could pick that up on the mic.
9357000	9360000	But the minute Loki, like, shifts in his chair, he perks up.
9360000	9362000	Like, what are you doing, asshole?
9363000	9364000	Alright.
