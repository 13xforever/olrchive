0	7000	Orange Lounge Radio
7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	17000	We're an hour earlier and yet somehow still exactly the same time
17000	21000	We hope you're well rested with the extra hour you gained last night because tonight you'll need that brain working
21000	27000	We have news to catch up on, report, and make and it all starts right now in the show where every gamer has a voice
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello my friends and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice
36000	44000	It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight, episode number 706 of our show for this November the 5th of 2017
44000	47000	I almost said November the 2017 of the 5th
47000	52000	Yes, remember the 5th of November or whatever that is, I never even saw that movie, I just heard about it through everybody else
52000	55000	You don't know about the actual Guy Fawkes day?
55000	59000	Whatever I read on Wikipedia and then promptly forgot
59000	60000	Girl
60000	62000	Hi DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers, how are you?
62000	64000	I'm your resident history nerd
64000	67000	And enjoying some decaf coffee tonight
67000	69000	My face is burnt now
69000	72000	I decided to punish DarkSakura tonight for what I don't know
72000	78000	But I said you're going to drink this out of the DC Comics Justice League mug that I have because she's not a big fan of DC
78000	82000	But then Loki, Techmaster Loki over there suggested DC is decaf
82000	84000	Decaf coffee
84000	86000	This DC decaf mug
86000	87000	Yes
87000	88000	Perfect
88000	93000	And for the record, remember remember the 5th of November the gunpowder treason and plot
93000	98000	I know of no reason why the gunpowder treason should ever be forgot
98000	99000	Okay
99000	101000	That's how it goes, so whatever
101000	103000	Alright, props to you
103000	105000	And I could not in a train
105000	107000	Y'all need culture
109000	112000	Y'all wouldn't know culture if you got smacked in the face with yogurt
112000	116000	Remember remember, one fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish
116000	118000	Y'all bitches need culture
119000	122000	Listen to the muffins child, listen to the don'ts
122000	125000	Don't let the cat in the hat in your house because you'll fuck shit up
125000	127000	And you know what? Fucking banana muffin
128000	132000	Alright anyway, hi everybody, we got a busy week
132000	136000	So first I want to say sorry we weren't here last week and that was totally my fault
136000	138000	I had no voice at all last week
138000	141000	When I woke up Saturday morning I had hosted Rocky the night before
141000	145000	And I guess I was a little more extra than usual because it was Halloween after all
145000	147000	And so when I woke up on Saturday
147000	149000	It was literally like this
149000	150000	And I didn't know it
150000	154000	Like you should have asked Alan about how I sounded, it wasn't pretty
154000	158000	And so I have to make a judgement call on if there's going to be a show or no show
158000	160000	Because there's not going to be a show, Dark Soccer and Loki should get their evening back
160000	164000	So around 2 o'clock I was still sounding like this
164000	168000	So I was like alright we're not doing a show because I have to rest my voice because I need it for my job
168000	171000	So sorry guys but shit happens
171000	172000	So that's what happened last week
172000	175000	Sadly we won't be here next week
175000	179000	That was the pre-planned week off because of the long Veterans Day weekend
179000	180000	I'm actually going to be out of town
180000	184000	I'm going to Seattle so hoping to hit up some gaming related fun places while I'm up there
184000	186000	I just found out today
186000	188000	I'm going to go visit an old friend
188000	192000	I'm going to visit an old friend from LiveJournal who I've never met before
192000	196000	She lives in Bellevue so I get to go over there which I haven't been to before
196000	200000	I think that's just a stone's throw away from where
200000	202000	Where's Nintendo and Microsoft? Redmond?
202000	206000	Yeah I gotta travel there just to look at an office building
206000	208000	Because that's what they are, office buildings
208000	211000	There's nothing that exciting but at least I can say I went
211000	213000	You have to go to the Pinball Museum in Seattle
213000	214000	Is there a Pinball Museum in Seattle?
214000	216000	There is, I'll have to find out where
216000	217000	I'll send you the address
217000	219000	Yeah tell me where it is, I wouldn't mind hitting that up
219000	222000	Because we did all the big touristy stuff last time we were there
222000	226000	So we've done the Space Needle, we did the EMP, we did all that stuff
226000	228000	So I mean we'll probably do some of it again
228000	230000	But I wouldn't mind seeing other parts of Seattle too
230000	232000	So we'll see
232000	235000	Anyhow so we've got to make this show really good
235000	238000	Because it's got to last for a few weeks for people
238000	239000	So sorry about that
239000	241000	You can also of course join us live
241000	244000	We do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network
244000	245000	vognetwork.com
245000	247000	6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern
247000	249000	Usually right after our pal Bobby Black Wolf
249000	252000	But we're not the only one that's been having issues lately
252000	254000	Bobby's been having internet drama
254000	256000	That's been keeping him offline
256000	258000	He doesn't have enough bandwidth at home I guess
258000	261000	Something in his neighborhood has screwed something up
261000	263000	And here's my thought Bobby
263000	265000	Maybe it's somebody's Xbox
265000	266000	Because I want to talk about this
266000	270000	So this is some drama that is like unfolding on Twitter as we speak
270000	274000	Because I had a pretty serious problem today
274000	276000	And it's my Xbox's fault
276000	277000	Now let me tell you what's going on
277000	283000	So I get online today and I'm setting up for the show tonight by logging on to vognetwork.com
283000	287000	But I get a new pop-up window that I don't usually get on vognetwork.com
287000	288000	And it's Xfinity
288000	290000	And I was like wow I've never seen that before
290000	292000	And Xfinity actually popped, which is Comcast
292000	296000	They popped up a thing that said you are at 90% of your bandwidth for the month
296000	301000	You have used 900 and something gigs out of your 1024 that are available
301000	304000	Because everybody has a terabyte of data a month now
304000	307000	It used to be like 250 and then it's been slowly climbing up
307000	310000	Well I was like the fuck?
310000	312000	And they were like for the calendar month
312000	315000	And I'm like it is the 5th of November
315000	318000	And I've used a terabyte of data this month
318000	320000	I'm like what the fuck's going on?
320000	323000	So I log into the Comcast website
323000	328000	And sure enough most months we use about maybe 380 gigs
328000	330000	I think last month there was 410 gigs
330000	333000	But I downloaded Destiny 2 PC last month right?
333000	335000	So it's going to be a little more
335000	339000	But usually we use between 300 and 400 gigs
339000	342000	Which is pretty impressive considering there's two tech nerds in this house
342000	343000	Myself and my husband
343000	346000	I do this radio show on Sunday Night from here
346000	348000	And I've been doing live streaming
348000	350000	And you probably watch Netflix and all that
350000	353000	Yeah I binge watch Stranger Things 2 when that first came out
353000	356000	So we use a lot of technology
356000	358000	But sure enough it was like
358000	361000	At this point it said I'd use something like
361000	363000	1050 gigs or something like that
363000	365000	I was like what the hell is going on?
365000	368000	Well luckily my pal Xtifer
368000	371000	Who you guys remember from Guys on a Show
371000	374000	He bought me as a Christmas present this last year
374000	376000	A Google Wifi
376000	379000	And the reason why this helps right now is because
379000	382000	On Google Wifi you can with the phone app
382000	385000	Go in and it shows you which devices are connected
385000	387000	What's using bandwidth right now
387000	390000	And you can pull a report for the last 7 days
390000	391000	The last 30 days
391000	393000	So I was like alright well I remember that
393000	396000	So I was like I want to see is it on my computer
396000	397000	Is it on Alan's computer
397000	400000	Is there an unknown device that's figured out our Wifi password
400000	402000	That's downloading all of the porn
402000	404000	Like what's going on?
404000	406000	So I go onto the Google
406000	408000	The Google Wifi and I pull the report and it says
408000	411000	My Xbox has pulled down
411000	414000	I think it's 940 gigabytes
414000	416000	In the past 7 days
416000	418000	940
418000	420000	By itself
420000	421000	The Xbox
421000	424000	I have a 1 terabyte drive on the Xbox One
424000	426000	So I started
426000	428000	Obviously I did what anybody does
428000	430000	And I wrote passive aggressive tweets about the situation
430000	432000	Tagging Xfinity and tagging
432000	434000	Xbox because I'm sitting here going
434000	437000	The Xfinity website is like you get charged
437000	439000	$10 for every 50 gigs you go over
439000	440000	And I'm like fuck that
440000	441000	I didn't do anything
441000	443000	So I called and
443000	445000	They told me that you get like
445000	447000	2 courtesy months
447000	448000	Or something
448000	450000	Like you get months where you're allowed to go over
450000	451000	And they don't penalize you
451000	453000	So this month is going to end up being a courtesy month
453000	454000	I guess for me
454000	456000	I'm going to download all the porn now
456000	458000	Might as well at this point right
458000	460000	But I'm still kind of shocked
460000	462000	Like what the hell happened
462000	464000	So obviously one thing that's on my mind
464000	466000	That I think a lot of people are suggesting on Twitter
466000	468000	Because now one of my buddies
468000	471000	Who runs another podcast that's more popular than this one
471000	473000	Retweeted like all my tweets
473000	475000	I don't know if he was having the same problems or what
475000	477000	But now I've got all these people that are giving me suggestions
477000	479000	And everybody is kind of saying
479000	481000	Well do you have an Xbox One X
481000	483000	That's the first question I get
483000	484000	The answer is no
484000	486000	I have not changed my Xbox One
486000	488000	Since Forza Horizon 2 was new
488000	490000	And that was the game that convinced me to get a new Xbox
490000	493000	I bought my Xbox when they just released
493000	495000	That one terabyte model
495000	497000	So I do have a one terabyte Xbox One
497000	498000	But still
498000	500000	Why is my Xbox trying to download
500000	503000	940 gigs to my one terabyte Xbox One
503000	505000	So I unplugged the fucker
505000	507000	I was like you're done
507000	508000	I unplugged it
508000	510000	The one thing the Comcast guy suggested I do
510000	512000	Which I was like oh yeah that's kind of obvious
512000	514000	He said change your Wi-Fi pass
514000	516000	Or just make sure nobody else has it
516000	518000	He's like cause I can't see on my end
518000	520000	What devices are using your bandwidth
520000	521000	And I'm sitting here going
521000	523000	I just fucking told you it's my Xbox
523000	526000	But I'm like don't get mad at the call center people
526000	527000	They're just doing their job
527000	529000	So I was like alright you know what
529000	530000	Why not
530000	532000	Is changing your Wi-Fi password a bad idea
532000	533000	No it's not
533000	534000	So I went ahead and did that
534000	536000	So now I plug back in the Xbox
536000	538000	I'm just not going to give the Xbox the new password
538000	540000	Trying to figure out what's going on
540000	542000	And I do notice it's trying to download
542000	545000	A 43 gigabyte update for Quantum Break
545000	547000	And I'd heard that Quantum Break was getting a big update
547000	549000	But I don't have a 4K TV
549000	551000	I don't have an Xbox One X
551000	552000	I don't understand why
552000	554000	Was it attempted to download it like 20 times
554000	556000	That's what I think is happening
556000	557000	That it's been attempted
557000	558000	Now I can't prove this yet
558000	561000	But I don't have a lot of space left on my Xbox One
561000	563000	I filled that thing to the brim
563000	564000	That terabyte
564000	566000	I mean because I don't usually delete things
566000	567000	Because why should I
567000	569000	So it's like 92% full
569000	570000	So I'm wondering if
570000	572000	Is it trying to download
572000	573000	The Quantum Break update
573000	575000	Failing and starting over
575000	576000	Over and over again
576000	577000	Possibly
577000	578000	So here's
578000	580000	It should be smart to see that it can't fit on there
580000	581000	So it can't update it
581000	582000	That's what it does on the PlayStation
582000	583000	That's
583000	584000	And that
584000	585000	Geez Microsoft learn
585000	587000	But here's the weird thing you guys
587000	588000	I can't
588000	590000	Like nobody else on Twitter is complaining about this
590000	592000	So I can't sit here and go
592000	594000	Microsoft's got a big problem
594000	595000	This is widespread
595000	597000	Where's the news story on Kotaku
597000	598000	Alerting everybody about this
598000	600000	Because it does seem like
600000	602000	I'm the only guy that this is happening to
602000	604000	But here's my first question everybody
604000	607000	Would you go look at your bandwidth report
607000	608000	For the month
608000	610000	And especially if you have Google Wi-Fi
610000	611000	Or something similar that will tell you
611000	612000	What your Xbox is doing
612000	613000	And would you let me know
613000	614000	If anybody else out there
614000	616000	Is having this extreme problem
616000	617000	That I'm having
617000	619000	Just makes me glad I never bought one
619000	621000	I guess but I mean
621000	622000	I don't know what to think
622000	625000	Like I want to say I feel bad for Microsoft
625000	626000	But I don't
626000	629000	But it's weird that this is isolated
629000	630000	Like that's the
630000	631000	And so it makes me wonder did I do something wrong
631000	634000	But I haven't done anything outside the norm
634000	636000	I barely use my Xbox One for gaming
636000	637000	It's just a Microsoft device
637000	640000	It likes updating on the fly
640000	641000	Here's a thought
641000	642000	That maybe you have enough
642000	644000	Because you know there's a difference between
644000	646000	Actual size and virtual space right
646000	647000	Right
647000	649000	So it could mean that you have enough in one aspect
649000	651000	But the moment that it's filling up the cache
651000	652000	It's hitting that point where it can't
652000	654000	But it's still reading that you've got room for it
654000	655000	Yeah I don't know
655000	657000	So you just might be at a sweet spot for that
657000	658000	Interesting
658000	660000	Or in this case a sour spot
660000	662000	Well I'm gonna go look at some comments in chat
662000	664000	Because everybody's playing armchair IT
664000	666000	Which when you get a bunch of nerds together
666000	667000	That's what's going to happen
667000	669000	Not me I'm not at work
669000	670000	So in our chat room
670000	673000	Over at live.vognetwork.com
673000	674000	Because again we do tape live
674000	675000	Six o'clock Pacific
675000	676000	Nine o'clock Eastern
676000	678000	Oh and Bobby, thank you very much
678000	680000	Bobby Blackwolf did make it to chat tonight
680000	682000	And he says he fixed the web chat
682000	685000	So if live.vognetwork.com wasn't working for you before
685000	686000	It might now
686000	687000	Because he changed the web app
687000	688000	So hopefully it'll work again
688000	689000	Thanks Bobby
689000	691000	Speaking of armchair IT
691000	692000	Let's see
692000	694000	I'm looking in chat
694000	695000	Tigerclaw says
695000	698000	When you leave your Xbox One in an instant on mode
698000	700000	Whenever you get one of those free Xbox One games
700000	702000	It'll automatically download them too
702000	704000	So it's best to have power saving mode enabled
704000	708000	I've never had a game download that I didn't tell it to
708000	712000	Like I will go into the Xbox gold membership thing
712000	714000	And download what I
714000	716000	But I've never had the Xbox just say
716000	718000	Surprise we delivered you a game
718000	719000	So I don't have that setting on
719000	721000	I have had it update games
721000	722000	But that's
722000	723000	I mean
723000	725000	Usually you want that right
725000	728000	Isn't that what PlayStation Plus had as a feature
728000	730000	When it first launched was auto updating games
730000	733000	Yeah I mean that's what PlayStation does now
733000	736000	But like if I don't have space for the update
736000	739000	It knows it's like well this isn't gonna fit
739000	740000	So we're not updating
740000	741000	Bobby Blockwolf says
741000	744000	I think the Xbox One actually has a thing in settings
744000	746000	That shows its data usage
746000	748000	A I can't find it
748000	750000	But probably B because
750000	753000	For it to do anything it wants to go online
753000	755000	And I'm sure as you all can sympathize right now
755000	758000	I don't want to put my Xbox One back online
758000	761000	Although I guess if this month is gonna be a wash anyway
761000	763000	Maybe now's the time to do it
763000	764000	When I can sit there and watch it
764000	767000	But I'd prefer to know at least a little bit about what I'm doing
767000	770000	Before I put it back online if that makes sense
770000	771000	Maybe I can tell
771000	772000	I bet through Google Wi-Fi
772000	774000	I bet I can let it go online
774000	775000	But like throttle it
775000	777000	I think Google Wi-Fi lets you do that
777000	778000	I think you can say
778000	782000	This device can use no more than X amount of data per second or something
782000	783000	So maybe that's what I'll do
783000	784000	I gotta say
784000	787000	The winner in this whole scenario is Google Wi-Fi
787000	789000	So props to that
789000	791000	Because that helped me figure out what it is
791000	793000	So that when people on the internet are like
793000	795000	Are you sure you didn't get hacked
795000	797000	Or how do you know it's your Xbox
797000	799000	It's like I got the receipts
799000	801000	Receipts, I has them
801000	803000	Here they are
803000	807000	Korkay in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says
807000	809000	Go for the high score
809000	811000	Why not?
811000	812000	Why not?
812000	814000	Even though I kind of promised him I wasn't gonna do that
814000	815000	But there you go
815000	816000	Alright
816000	818000	So yeah some folks in chat
818000	821000	SSU100Matt says I'm only seeing I use 15 gigs
821000	824000	Tigerclass says I'm only using 49 gigs
824000	826000	Well good for y'all
826000	827000	Yeah I know
827000	828000	But that's the weird
828000	829000	Those guys have Xbox ones
829000	832000	And so what is unique about my situation
832000	833000	I don't know
833000	834000	I can't figure it out
834000	838000	But I can tell you it's trying to download an update for Quantum Break and Forza
838000	840000	And I put all the screenshots on my Twitter
840000	842000	Twitter.com slash Skye S-K-I-E
842000	845000	If you wanna continue to play Armchair Warrior
845000	849000	I tagged Xbox in all these posts so maybe Xbox support will fire me back something
849000	850000	But I don't
850000	851000	Like
851000	853000	Here's the thing at the end of the day
853000	858000	I don't particularly care if my Xbox is gonna download all of this data
858000	860000	I care that I'm gonna get charged for it
860000	861000	So
861000	864000	And especially if this isn't just happening to me
864000	865000	You know what I'm saying?
865000	867000	Really just fuck Comcast
867000	868000	Cause that's really the problem
868000	871000	Cause if you had unlimited bandwidth as we should all
871000	873000	It wouldn't even be an issue
873000	874000	That's true
874000	875000	So there's you know
875000	877000	But I also think the system
877000	880000	The Xbox should be smart enough
880000	881000	That like
881000	883000	There should be some type of internal trigger
883000	885000	That when it's used a hundred gigabytes in a month
885000	887000	Or two hundred gigabytes in a month
887000	889000	It should pop up a window going
889000	891000	I'm eating a lot of data and this is why
891000	893000	Do you wanna continue?
893000	895000	Like at least give me the option to put
895000	897000	Cause I would have never known this was happening
897000	899000	If that pop up
899000	900000	From Xfinity
900000	901000	So to Comcast credit
901000	902000	If they hadn't put a pop up
902000	903000	That said you've used ninety percent
904000	906000	Hey it looks like that you've used a lot of data
906000	909000	Would you like me to download some more data for you?
909000	910000	Says Clippy
914000	915000	There you go
915000	916000	So that's the drama I've been dealing with
916000	919000	So stay tuned for potentially an update in two weeks
919000	922000	But for right now the Xbox One is sitting in the corner
922000	925000	It is not allowed to have the new Wi-Fi password
925000	926000	That is the punishment
926000	927000	Grounded dammit
927000	930000	You're grounded and you're not getting the Wi-Fi password
931000	932000	That is what's happening
932000	934000	Loki and DarkSakura got the new Wi-Fi password
934000	937000	But the Xbox did not get the Wi-Fi password
937000	939000	Now that I know that I can download as much as I want
939000	941000	I'm downloading all the porn right now so it's fine
943000	944000	Like Corky said earlier in chat
944000	945000	Go for the high score
945000	946000	Why not?
948000	949000	Come on Nolgus in chat says
949000	951000	Does Xbox have a beta thing
951000	953000	Xbox Insider or something?
953000	955000	You know what for the sake of transparency
955000	956000	Yes they do
956000	957000	And I'm in it
957000	959000	So is that
959000	961000	Is the problem because my console is doing something
961000	962000	In a beta mode
962000	963000	Which I understand
963000	965000	Microsoft's gonna wash your hands of liability
965000	967000	If that thing happened or whatever
967000	968000	No that's just usually
968000	970000	It just means it downloads more frequent
970000	971000	System updates
971000	973000	980 gigs of updates
973000	974000	Good
974000	976000	I mean but I doubt it would
976000	978000	I doubt it would keep doing that though
978000	979000	Yeah
979000	980000	Because usually it would just download
980000	981000	You know the latest one
984000	985000	Brad from Paw Culture says
985000	987000	You have the Xbox on Wi-Fi
987000	988000	That has to be rough on gaming
988000	989000	No
989000	990000	I actually
990000	992000	Right now because the PlayStation 4
992000	994000	Moved into my office
994000	996000	So I could do streaming from the PlayStation 4
996000	999000	My Xbox One has become the CBS
999000	1001000	So I can watch Star Trek Discovery device
1001000	1003000	Netflix for when I binge watched
1003000	1004000	Stranger Things 2
1004000	1005000	When we weren't here last week
1005000	1006000	Device
1006000	1008000	So it's been kind of my main media device
1008000	1010000	Maybe it's Star Trek Discovery's fault
1010000	1012000	Did Star Trek Discovery break my Xbox
1012000	1013000	Maybe it did
1015000	1016000	Perhaps I don't know
1016000	1018000	But all those things have been running fine
1018000	1019000	And great quality
1019000	1020000	I don't have 4K
1020000	1021000	My television isn't 4K
1021000	1024000	So I wasn't downloading like 4K Stranger Things
1024000	1026000	But still
1026000	1028000	And again that was all technically October
1028000	1030000	Because I watched that Stranger Things
1030000	1031000	Like in the first three days
1031000	1033000	You guys it is so good
1033000	1034000	It is so good
1034000	1035000	Stranger Things in 4K
1035000	1036000	Except for Episode 7
1036000	1037000	Fuck Episode 7
1037000	1038000	But The Resident's fine
1038000	1039000	Which one was Episode 7?
1039000	1040000	The one that was
1040000	1042000	Without spoiling
1042000	1044000	The Back Door Pilot
1044000	1045000	The Back Door Pilot
1045000	1046000	Oh yeah
1046000	1047000	That little
1047000	1048000	I don't know
1048000	1051000	I liked the main person in that one
1051000	1052000	Yeah me too
1052000	1053000	Me too
1053000	1054000	A lot
1054000	1055000	Plus I liked the makeover
1055000	1056000	Yeah
1056000	1057000	We have to keep it
1057000	1058000	Plus it was all MTV
1058000	1059000	Some people are very hyper about spoilers
1059000	1060000	I know
1060000	1061000	That's all I'm saying
1061000	1062000	When do we get to spoil the shit out of Stranger Things?
1062000	1064000	I guess we have to give it a good 60 days
1064000	1065000	Huh?
1065000	1066000	2018?
1066000	1067000	I don't know
1067000	1068000	Too soon
1068000	1069000	Anyway
1069000	1071000	I guess also that's kind of the department of critical myth
1071000	1072000	Pod culture
1072000	1074000	The more TV based shows on our network to get into
1074000	1076000	We're usually here to talk about games
1076000	1077000	I do want to talk about games
1077000	1080000	So the kickoff topic I did want to talk about
1080000	1082000	Was I wanted to talk a little bit about
1082000	1084000	Digital distribution
1084000	1086000	Now this is a topic that's come up on our show before
1086000	1087000	But
1087000	1089000	I don't know if you guys heard about this this week
1089000	1091000	But there were some major earnings calls
1091000	1092000	That happened in this past week
1092000	1093000	Activision, EA
1093000	1096000	They do their quarterly stockholder calls
1096000	1097000	Because at the end of the day
1097000	1099000	Companies like EA, Activision
1099000	1100000	They exist
1100000	1101000	What?
1101000	1102000	To make money
1102000	1103000	To make who money?
1103000	1104000	To make their shareholders money
1104000	1107000	And that's why people talk about investing in the stock market
1107000	1108000	Right?
1108000	1109000	America 101
1109000	1110000	There you go
1110000	1111000	Okay
1111000	1112000	So every quarter
1112000	1114000	These companies have to basically produce
1114000	1115000	You know
1115000	1117000	They have to update their shareholders on what they're doing
1117000	1119000	So Activision did an earnings call this past week
1119000	1120000	Where they said
1120000	1126000	50% of Destiny 2's sales on consoles came via download
1126000	1128000	Rather than a retail disc
1128000	1129000	Now
1129000	1130000	I would have believed that
1130000	1132000	If we were talking the PC numbers only
1132000	1133000	Because I would have thought
1133000	1134000	Oh there's a ton of people
1134000	1136000	That probably just do digital on PC
1136000	1140000	Because of storefronts like Battle.net and so forth
1140000	1143000	And that there's people that are buying Destiny with Warcraft gold
1143000	1144000	Because you can do that
1144000	1146000	The way things are set up on Battle.net
1146000	1147000	But no
1147000	1149000	That factor is for
1149000	1150000	I guess all of it
1150000	1152000	Or for the consoles
1152000	1154000	I buy everything digitally
1154000	1155000	For the most part
1155000	1156000	Yeah
1156000	1158000	And I guess this is getting bigger and bigger
1158000	1159000	Earlier this year
1159000	1160000	EA said
1160000	1165000	They expect 40% of their console game sales to come from downloads in 2017
1165000	1168000	That is a jump up 10% from where they were at
1168000	1171000	30% of sales in 2016
1171000	1173000	EA has gone on record before saying
1173000	1174000	Quote
1174000	1177000	They're gonna be 100% digital company period
1177000	1178000	It's going to be there someday
1178000	1180000	It's inevitable
1180000	1181000	No
1181000	1183000	And I don't think that's gonna be the case
1183000	1184000	Because here's the problem
1184000	1185000	Yes
1185000	1188000	It's a nice idea to have it all digital and everything
1188000	1189000	But if everybody goes all digital
1190000	1192000	Remember there's that wonderful company
1192000	1193000	Comcast
1193000	1195000	That has those wonderful bandwidth caps
1195000	1196000	That will fuck you over
1196000	1197000	Right
1197000	1198000	If you try to download everything
1198000	1199000	So that's why it will never be that way
1199000	1202000	Because fucking net neutrality and all that shit is
1202000	1204000	Not in the picture because
1204000	1206000	Those companies want to make money too
1206000	1207000	So
1207000	1208000	Because you have that
1208000	1209000	And also because
1209000	1211000	And this is very important
1211000	1213000	These same fucking companies
1213000	1215000	Keep pushing these stupid
1215000	1217000	Collectors editions
1217000	1220000	And shit with giant statue editions
1220000	1222000	You can't digitally download those
1222000	1224000	You can't digitally download a statue
1224000	1227000	You wouldn't want to digitally download a statue
1227000	1228000	Correct
1228000	1229000	Okay
1229000	1231000	So you think there's still going to be a market
1231000	1232000	For physical stuff
1232000	1234000	But it's gonna be kind of limited
1234000	1235000	It's gonna be like
1235000	1236000	They do it now
1236000	1238000	They can still do digital distribution
1238000	1240000	But they do it now where they have editions
1240000	1243000	It's collectors editions that don't include the game
1243000	1244000	Why?
1244000	1245000	I know
1245000	1246000	Why would you do that?
1247000	1248000	So
1248000	1250000	Well is it because they expect that people are gonna
1250000	1252000	Download to play hour zero digitally
1252000	1255000	So this is just literally a box of shit
1255000	1257000	With the games branding on it
1257000	1259000	I mean like for me like if I'm gonna
1259000	1261000	If I'm looking forward to a game
1261000	1263000	And I want to play it day one
1263000	1264000	I'm not gonna pre-order
1264000	1266000	Because that means I gotta drive out to the store
1266000	1268000	To go pick it up and do all that nonsense
1268000	1269000	Whereas I can
1269000	1271000	Digitally pre-order it or download it
1271000	1273000	Fuck I'm not pre-ordering shit
1273000	1275000	But I'll digitally order it like
1276000	1278000	The day before or something like that
1278000	1281000	And it'll unlock at 9pm the night before it comes out
1281000	1284000	That's what I did with Destiny 2 on PC
1284000	1288000	Is that I bought it like two days before it launched
1288000	1291000	So it would be all loaded and ready to go
1291000	1293000	But with Destiny 2 I knew
1293000	1296000	If I walked into a store and bought it on a box
1296000	1297000	All I was gonna get
1297000	1300000	Maybe I was gonna get a Blu-ray or DVD with the game
1300000	1302000	But it was likely gonna be a code
1302000	1305000	And a game like that is so much online anyway
1305000	1308000	You're gonna get some code for your online access
1308000	1311000	So there's no reason to really have the physical edition
1311000	1313000	Whereas here's my thing
1313000	1316000	I guess I've had the hardest time buying into this digital stuff
1316000	1318000	Because I'm still this big believer of
1318000	1321000	Well when you buy a game on a disc or on a cartridge
1321000	1324000	Let's say Mario Odyssey on the flip side of things
1324000	1326000	I have a cartridge for that
1326000	1329000	And if someday I decide I'm sick of Mario Odyssey
1329000	1330000	Which I doubt is gonna happen
1330000	1332000	But we'll get into that later
1332000	1334000	I could sell that cartridge
1334000	1335000	Or I could loan that
1335000	1336000	What happened to that?
1336000	1338000	It's because I'm lazy
1338000	1339000	Two things
1339000	1340000	One, I'm lazy
1340000	1343000	So I don't wanna have to worry about selling that cartridge
1343000	1344000	Or whatever
1344000	1345000	And it depends on the system
1345000	1346000	Like if I had a Switch
1346000	1348000	There's not a lot of onboard storage for that
1348000	1352000	Then yes, physical copies are gonna be more appealing to me
1352000	1356000	Whereas I've got 500GB of space on my Playstation 4
1356000	1358000	So I can download a bunch of games at once
1358000	1361000	And I don't have to worry about swapping discs out and stuff like that
1361000	1363000	Not to say that I don't buy disc versions of games
1363000	1365000	I do sometimes
1365000	1367000	It's just not all the time
1367000	1369000	Usually I'm getting stuff on sale
1369000	1371000	But with that
1371000	1373000	There's also another factor
1373000	1377000	GameStop is not gonna really be happy with them going all digital
1377000	1378000	They've tried to do it in the past
1378000	1380000	They've tried to say that they're gonna go all digital
1380000	1381000	Never gonna happen
1381000	1383000	Because it's such a big monster
1383000	1385000	And they control the industry
1385000	1387000	So they're not gonna
1387000	1389000	It's not gonna happen
1389000	1391000	They're never gonna be fully digital
1391000	1393000	Because there's people that want physical versions of the game
1393000	1395000	There's gonna be GameStop
1395000	1398000	And other big retailers that that's a big chunk of their money
1398000	1400000	Well GameStop, it's most of their money
1400000	1402000	So they're not gonna just give that up quietly
1402000	1404000	And bandwidth caps
1404000	1405000	You're not gonna be able to do that
1405000	1406000	Plus internet speeds
1406000	1408000	Because as these games get bigger and bigger
1408000	1409000	The 4K content
1409000	1411000	That's more data that you're dumping down the tubes
1411000	1414000	And it's gonna take a lot longer to download
1414000	1418000	Especially with all these internet companies fighting to upgrade their service
1418000	1420000	I wanted to get to DarkSakura's perspective
1420000	1421000	But real quick
1421000	1422000	I wanted to mention
1422000	1425000	I was noticing a lot of parallels maybe with the music industry
1425000	1428000	You know 10 years ago with the invention of the iPod or whatever
1428000	1431000	And you know just the fact that a lot of people were pirating their music
1431000	1433000	With things like Napster or whatever
1433000	1435000	Apple kind of came up with this method to legitimize it
1435000	1438000	A lot of other people kind of went on that as well
1438000	1439000	But anyway my point is
1439000	1441000	A lot of record stores are gone because of it
1441000	1442000	Tower Records
1442000	1443000	Gone
1443000	1444000	The Warehouse
1444000	1445000	Gone
1445000	1447000	All these big record stores I remember from my youth they're gone
1447000	1450000	Now that's left are indie niche places
1450000	1453000	You know like we have a local chain here, Dimple
1453000	1455000	You know they seem to do pretty well because
1455000	1457000	They also expand the books and movies
1457000	1458000	Yeah that's true
1458000	1460000	They've also expanded to books and movies
1460000	1461000	And I noticed
1461000	1464000	What's the music that people seem to be buying these days?
1464000	1465000	Vinyl
1465000	1466000	Vinyl
1466000	1467000	Exactly
1467000	1469000	And it's kind of that collector's edition stuff
1469000	1471000	I found a place downtown
1471000	1475000	Because I was when I had to get my window replaced on my Fiat
1475000	1478000	And I was at this little place like 16th and E
1478000	1482000	And walked around down E to go have breakfast at this little place called Shine
1482000	1483000	Have you ever been there?
1483000	1484000	No
1484000	1487000	But on the way there there's like this little like thrift store
1487000	1489000	But it was all full of fucking vinyl
1489000	1491000	Nothing but vinyl in a thrift store
1491000	1494000	Yeah and speaking of I'm going on this trip to Seattle
1494000	1497000	And I remember one of the things I bought on my last trip to Seattle
1497000	1500000	This is like seriously one of my prized possessions
1500000	1504000	This is my copy of Abba's The Visitors
1504000	1506000	My favorite album from one of my favorite bands
1506000	1507000	I bought you one
1507000	1508000	Probably my favorite band ever
1508000	1509000	You did
1509000	1510000	I got you Super Trooper
1510000	1511000	You got me Super Trooper
1511000	1514000	But this is the one that I got in Seattle at Pike Place Market
1514000	1515000	At a very similar store
1515000	1517000	It was like a thrift store but it was all vinyl
1517000	1519000	And I was like do they have Abba, Abba, Abba, Abba
1519000	1520000	And then they had the visitors
1520000	1524000	What's that place in San Francisco on Market near Castro?
1524000	1525000	Is that Rasputin?
1525000	1526000	Yeah I think it's Rasputin
1526000	1529000	Because that's used to where I would go to buy laser discs
1529000	1533000	Like I found my Wizard of Oz laser disc there
1533000	1537000	It's like two places down from like the Brody salon
1537000	1540000	But it's like right there at Market in Castro
1540000	1543000	J.D. has regrets to inform us they closed
1543000	1544000	Sad
1544000	1547000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat saying
1547000	1553000	I buy new albums on vinyl now and get the free MP3 download for the USB stick in my car
1553000	1554000	So
1554000	1556000	I have one
1556000	1558000	I only have a handful of albums
1558000	1562000	I have a copy of Rubber Soul because that was my favorite Beatles album
1562000	1567000	I have Gorillaz Demon Days which I have it unopened
1567000	1570000	So if I need a quick 500 bones I could sell it
1570000	1572000	Because it's a first printing
1572000	1576000	I have two Rodale albums
1576000	1579000	I have Even Worse and then I have Mandatory Fun
1579000	1580000	Because we got them to sign it
1580000	1582000	Yeah I mean I don't even own a record player
1582000	1585000	So the only reason I own that Abba on vinyl
1585000	1589000	Is because it is a relic of the time period from which that album came out
1589000	1593000	And that record was likely used to play that music
1593000	1598000	You know what I mean like it's more the collector thrift store kind of atmosphere of it
1598000	1601000	It's very hard to explain but I bet a lot of you that have bought vinyls
1601000	1602000	Probably understand
1602000	1607000	It's more the fact that you know I own something of that time period that is that album
1607000	1610000	I almost bought a Panasonic record player at that place
1610000	1611000	Well the record player is coming back
1611000	1612000	You know why?
1612000	1613000	Anyway let me
1613000	1614000	Wait it had an 8 track player
1614000	1617000	We've been too far into music which you know I know a lot of us love music
1617000	1620000	But Jamie what are your thoughts quickly on the digital versus
1620000	1622000	Especially because you've been a big collector
1622000	1624000	But I don't know how much you guys have embraced digital
1624000	1626000	But what's kind of your thoughts when you hear EA saying
1626000	1629000	We're going to be a 100% digital company
1629000	1631000	Okay
1634000	1635000	I kind of don't care
1635000	1638000	Okay if it wasn't EA saying it what about Activision?
1638000	1639000	Still don't care
1639000	1641000	Still don't care because then
1641000	1642000	Probably even less so
1642000	1647000	I mean like look at all of the like World of Warcraft
1647000	1649000	Look at Overwatch
1649000	1650000	Look at all that
1650000	1651000	Right
1651000	1653000	Those are already digital only pretty much
1653000	1654000	Right
1654000	1656000	I mean you used to be able to get discs for them
1656000	1659000	But computers aren't even built with DVD drives anymore
1659000	1661000	You know
1663000	1664000	I'm like this
1664000	1668000	My thought is that if I download a game
1668000	1670000	That I want to keep badly enough
1670000	1673000	I'm going to copy those files off to external media
1673000	1675000	And have an archive
1675000	1677000	I do that anyway with my stuff
1677000	1679000	You know my um
1679000	1682000	For example I mean my iTunes directory right
1682000	1684000	It's all housed on an external drive
1684000	1686000	I manage that shit myself
1686000	1688000	My games are exactly the same way
1688000	1691000	I have two internal drives one of them that's for all of my games
1691000	1695000	And it's marked so that I can take it out and put it in enclosure if I want to
1695000	1698000	And I have my 3 terabyte drive that I save all of my save files to
1699000	1700000	So
1700000	1702000	And the point of all this
1702000	1705000	Is that the PSP Go is just ahead of its time
1705000	1707000	Really wasn't it
1707000	1708000	No
1708000	1709000	I mean
1709000	1711000	It was ahead of something
1711000	1713000	I don't think it had a lot of storage
1713000	1718000	And the problem with the PSP Go is their stupid proprietary memory stick shit
1718000	1721000	That's also the other thing that kind of hurt the Vita
1721000	1725000	Is because they want to charge extra for their proprietary memory stick formats
1725000	1726000	So that
1726000	1728000	They can make more money
1728000	1729000	It's all about greed
1729000	1732000	That's the other thing about these companies saying oh we're going 100% digital
1732000	1738000	Do you really want them to be the only source of being able to purchase those files
1738000	1740000	Because if they go all digital
1740000	1742000	That means that there's no competition anymore
1742000	1746000	Because they're selling their game on one store front
1746000	1748000	And that's it
1748000	1751000	And there's not a chance that you're going to get it on sale
1751000	1753000	I mean they do sales every now and then
1753000	1757000	But you know it's a lot more prevalent with physical versions
1757000	1759000	So it just
1759000	1761000	And plus they're fucking lame
1761000	1763000	But they're fucking you know
1763000	1766000	Microtransaction bullshit that they're piecing shit apart
1766000	1768000	That's where they're making most of their money digitally
1768000	1770000	Is from that shit
1770000	1773000	And not necessarily I don't think selling digital copies
1773000	1777000	So Orange Dontradio we do like to say we are the show where every gamer has a voice
1777000	1780000	In an effort to kind of expand that and get more voices on our show
1780000	1783000	Tried something new this week and went to our Discord with this topic
1783000	1788000	Again you can join us on Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord
1788000	1790000	That will get you the invite you need to get on there
1790000	1792000	You don't need a special code outside of that
1792000	1794000	Just go to vognetwork.com slash Discord
1794000	1797000	And I asked our members on Discord their opinions on this
1797000	1799000	Let me read you some of the answers from Discord
1799000	1802000	Corky said I buy digital games when they're cheaper
1802000	1805000	Or when they're PC games that are just a code in a box
1805000	1807000	I've never owned a current gen console
1807000	1811000	So paying $60 for a game and trading it in after isn't something I've been able to do
1811000	1814000	I do sell old games on eBay to pay for my gaming habit
1814000	1816000	But it's a fairly rare occurrence
1816000	1819000	Evil G will probably be a general geek culture store
1819000	1821000	Like it's slowly transitioning to
1821000	1826000	My local one is probably one third ugly Funko Pops and clothing
1826000	1829000	I think you know what speaking of the Funko Pops
1829000	1832000	And look I own a few of them myself admittedly
1832000	1834000	I have the Golden Girls Funko Pops
1834000	1836000	I have a Winston from Overwatch sitting there
1836000	1839000	We really need to draw the line on those things
1839000	1841000	Like those fuckers are everywhere
1841000	1843000	I found them at a thrift store
1843000	1845000	I'm kinda over it you guys
1845000	1847000	Like we need something new
1847000	1850000	Like Funko Pops are losing cool points
1850000	1852000	Let people love what they love
1852000	1853000	You're right, you're right
1853000	1855000	You spend your hard earned money on whatever you want
1855000	1861000	But it's crazy going into like half the stores in the mall have an entire wall dedicated to it
1861000	1866000	And it's like do we need that many Funko Pops?
1866000	1868000	You haven't seen my cube
1868000	1871000	How many Funko Pops do you have in your cube at work?
1874000	1875000	Too many to count
1875000	1876000	No I know what I have
1876000	1878000	I have a baby group
1878000	1880000	I have a regular group
1880000	1882000	I don't need the whole inventory just a number
1882000	1883000	No I'm actually going through it
1883000	1884000	That's five on that one
1884000	1885000	Alright while you count
1885000	1887000	Dark Tetsuya talking about
1887000	1888000	Eleven in my cube
1888000	1890000	Dark Tetsuya talking about
1890000	1892000	I'm not super into mainstream AAA titles
1892000	1894000	But I definitely prefer physical whenever I can
1894000	1899000	A lot of indie publishers are doing physical releases for their upcoming Switch titles
1899000	1902000	Like I believe Limited Run Games is starting to do that
1902000	1906000	Maybe I'm old school but I just like seeing my game collection on the shelf
1906000	1909000	And with physical releases sometimes you get extras
1909000	1911000	Like Mighty No. 9 came with a poster, an art book
1911000	1914000	It's just not the same as a downloadable PDF in my opinion
1914000	1916000	But also Mighty No. 9 came with Mighty No. 9
1916000	1918000	So you know you have that too
1920000	1921000	Stop
1922000	1925000	Yeah you know the thing with the physical releases on Switch though
1925000	1926000	As cool as that is
1926000	1929000	A lot of them are coming way after the game is released
1929000	1932000	And it's not like I don't ever buy digital games
1932000	1936000	Like sure I buy $20 indie games on Switch
1936000	1938000	On PlayStation and so forth
1938000	1942000	Sure I buy those but that's because they're $20 games
1942000	1946000	They're not $60 games that I might want to sell
1946000	1949000	And try to get like $15 of it back someday
1949000	1950000	I don't know
1951000	1952000	Other comments
1952000	1954000	JD in our Discord saying
1954000	1957000	I prefer digital but I'll buy whatever's cheaper
1957000	1959000	Unless there's a strong reason for one or the other
1959000	1961000	I like digital because you can't lose the cartridge
1961000	1964000	And stuff tied to your account is good for data recovery
1964000	1966000	But now that we have two Switches
1966000	1968000	Being able to pass a cartridge back and forth
1968000	1972000	Means my husband can play games without buying a second copy
1972000	1974000	And Tigerclaw over on Discord said
1974000	1976000	Most people prefer physical
1976000	1977000	Well that's
1977000	1980000	That may not be what EA's telling us but anyway
1980000	1982000	Because digital has its limitations
1982000	1984000	Such as you running out of hard drive space
1984000	1986000	Or when a digital game is removed from the store
1986000	1988000	Which would prevent you from ever buying it
1988000	1989000	Oh that's true
1989000	1992000	Bringing up the point of delisting of games
1992000	1993000	Like the PT demo
1993000	1994000	You can't
1994000	1995000	I mean that's different because you didn't buy that
1995000	1997000	But I bet a lot of people would have bought that
1997000	1999000	But anyway you can't get that anymore
1999000	2000000	Right
2000000	2002000	So you know there's certain things that get delisted
2002000	2004000	You know Microsoft has this a lot
2004000	2006000	Rock band songs get delisted
2006000	2007000	You know and that's just part of the rights
2007000	2008000	Or whatever goes with that
2008000	2010000	Anyway thanks you guys over on Discord
2010000	2014000	vognetwork.com slash Discord
2015000	2017000	Let's see going to some other comments in our chat
2017000	2019000	Over at live.vognetwork.com
2019000	2020000	Ragenator says
2020000	2022000	With me being a PC gamer for five years now
2022000	2024000	I'm pretty damn good at finding all the sales and deals
2024000	2025000	Right Rob?
2025000	2028000	Yeah I mean obviously you call into the show a lot with those deals
2028000	2031000	But again and I've said this a lot
2031000	2033000	I don't mean to sound like a broken record
2033000	2035000	But this is my perspective on this
2035000	2038000	Is that when you buy a cartridge or something
2038000	2041000	Now you have something that has value
2041000	2043000	And sometimes that value goes way up
2043000	2046000	Like Dark Sakura's copy of what is it?
2046000	2048000	Like Symphony of the Night on Saturn or something
2048000	2050000	What's one of those games that goes up in value?
2050000	2051000	Yeah that one might be it
2051000	2052000	The more you own it
2052000	2053000	Right
2053000	2055000	Or like you just mentioned your Gorillaz album
2055000	2057000	You know went up to so much money
2057000	2059000	You know sometimes the value may go up
2059000	2062000	If you are lucky enough to own a copy of
2062000	2065000	Fucking what is it like Chrono Trigger on a cartridge still
2065000	2067000	That's still worth a lot of money right?
2067000	2068000	So there's that
2068000	2069000	Or Final Fight Guy
2069000	2071000	There's the value in your game
2071000	2072000	Ninja Gaiden Trilogy
2072000	2074000	But if the game is cheap enough
2074000	2075000	Where you're like
2075000	2078000	Eh I don't need any return on this investment
2078000	2082000	I'm good spending five bucks to get a copy of Civ IV
2082000	2085000	And all the expansions on a Steam sale
2085000	2088000	Then for that that's kind of worth it to most people
2088000	2089000	Because you know you're getting a game
2089000	2091000	That's probably worth much more than that
2091000	2093000	So you're not looking at the resale value
2093000	2095000	It's a big reason why I think humble bundles
2095000	2096000	Have done so well right?
2096000	2097000	So
2097000	2098000	Probably
2098000	2099000	Anyway thank you
2099000	2101000	Dungeon Buster naming some of the big collector's items
2101000	2102000	I'm trying to think of
2102000	2103000	Panzer Dragoon Saga
2103000	2105000	Have it
2105000	2106000	Silver Gun
2106000	2107000	Black Label Final Fantasy VII
2107000	2108000	Have it
2108000	2109000	So
2109000	2114000	And I actually traded my original US Dragon Ball GT Final Bout
2114000	2115000	For
2115000	2117000	What was that game?
2117000	2119000	Blue Stinger
2119000	2120000	And you know what?
2120000	2122000	It really isn't worth all that much money anymore
2122000	2124000	Magical Chase is worth some money
2124000	2129000	Because it was the last US Turbo Duo game
2129000	2131000	And just to be fair
2131000	2132000	Kaijuto in chat says
2132000	2135000	I don't collect Funko but I still love them
2135000	2137000	I love watching how happy people get on YouTube
2137000	2138000	When they find their pops fine
2139000	2141000	I didn't mean to crap on your fandom
2141000	2144000	If you love your Funko Pops and more power to you
2144000	2145000	Just
2145000	2147000	Every store you guys
2147000	2149000	Have you been to them all lately?
2149000	2150000	They're in like every store
2150000	2152000	They have a whole bunch half off at Barnes and Noble
2152000	2153000	Yeah I guess that's true
2153000	2155000	I guess people are buying them for reasons
2155000	2157000	SSJ 100 Matt pointed it out
2157000	2161000	Dragon Ball GT Final Bout went down way when they re-released it
2161000	2162000	So it's
2162000	2163000	I mean
2163000	2165000	One of the games that never lost any value
2165000	2167000	Was Rondo of Blood
2168000	2169000	Uh
2169000	2170000	Uh
2170000	2171000	Dracula X Rondo of Blood
2171000	2173000	Didn't Sweet Coat and Two kind of fall in value
2173000	2175000	When they finally put it out on Playstation 3?
2175000	2177000	I think maybe a little bit
2177000	2178000	But um
2178000	2180000	A little but not a lot
2180000	2182000	But I mean um
2182000	2183000	You know
2183000	2185000	If anyone wants to give me $500
2185000	2187000	By the way you can have a copy of Ninja Gaiden Trilogy
2187000	2189000	Just saying
2189000	2190000	In the box
2190000	2191000	You've been trying to get rid of that for like a year
2191000	2193000	We just didn't put it on eBay again
2193000	2194000	Alright
2194000	2196000	We could probably get money for it
2196000	2199000	I mean we could at least get $350 for it I'm sure
2199000	2200000	Alright
2200000	2202000	Well ok we've had enough talk about the digital distribution
2202000	2203000	Is that
2203000	2204000	Well let me just quickly
2204000	2207000	Let me just quickly kind of ask this question
2207000	2209000	Cause I asked this to Discord
2209000	2211000	In five years
2211000	2213000	Where are we at with digital distribution
2213000	2215000	Is it 100% of the industry
2215000	2216000	Is it 80% of the industry
2216000	2218000	Just quickly let me go around the room
2218000	2220000	Where is this industry at in five years of digital distribution
2220000	2222000	Loki?
2222000	2224000	60%
2224000	2226000	That seems very conservative
2226000	2227000	Yeah
2227000	2228000	Ok
2228000	2229000	I'm gonna go with 75
2229000	2230000	75%
2230000	2231000	Uh I
2231000	2233000	That's not accounting then for the 25%
2233000	2235000	That'll be pretty much all collector's items
2235000	2237000	Collector's editions
2237000	2239000	This is not where I want it to be
2239000	2241000	But I'm gonna say 90%
2241000	2243000	With the 10% being collector's edition
2243000	2246000	The vinyls of video games basically
2246000	2248000	I think that we're gonna though see
2248000	2250000	A good number of like actual
2250000	2253000	Brick and mortar stores going
2253000	2255000	Because it's all gonna be online
2255000	2257000	I think GameStop's in big trouble
2257000	2258000	I really do
2258000	2260000	GameStop is gonna go the way
2260000	2262000	If they don't change their business model
2262000	2265000	They're gonna go exactly the way that like our blockbusters did
2265000	2266000	And all that
2266000	2268000	Because digital really is
2268000	2270000	And on top of that you know it's really
2270000	2272000	I think
2272000	2273000	What's a good word
2273000	2275000	Attractive for the manufacturers
2275000	2277000	Because that's less in materials they have to pay
2277000	2279000	Less labor they have to pay
2279000	2281000	Less in shipping
2281000	2283000	They can put that money into advertising
2283000	2285000	And for digital content instead
2285000	2287000	And actually throttle
2287000	2289000	The sales of it if they run
2289000	2291000	You know hit a particular license number
2291000	2293000	All they have to do is just
2293000	2295000	Generate more licenses for it
2295000	2297000	So they're not the supply
2297000	2299000	Will always be there to meet the demand
2299000	2301000	Alright
2301000	2303000	Alright we'll
2303000	2305000	We'll probably dive into this topic again
2305000	2307000	I think this is something that is gonna be following
2307000	2309000	Our industry for a little while if you want to say something
2309000	2311000	And if you want to no longer participate at
2311000	2313000	Orangelaunchradio.com
2313000	2315000	In the meantime we're gonna talk about our gaming weeks
2315000	2317000	Because really it's been two weeks since we've been here
2317000	2319000	So let's talk a little bit about some of the games we've been
2319000	2321000	Playing this week
2321000	2323000	Some of the notable highlights
2323000	2325000	DarkSakura what have you been playing this week?
2325000	2327000	Idol Poring
2327000	2329000	Pokemon Go
2329000	2331000	You know
2331000	2333000	Me Tomo
2333000	2335000	I started Dragon Age Inquisition again
2335000	2337000	Because I fucking love that game
2337000	2339000	In fact my
2339000	2341000	Dragon Age fire got lit under me
2341000	2343000	By a dragon
2343000	2345000	Also
2345000	2347000	Crap what else was I playing
2347000	2349000	A little bit of Ragnarok online
2349000	2351000	And then I
2351000	2353000	I got a Switch
2353000	2355000	And three games
2355000	2357000	I acquired it
2357000	2359000	Now this is interesting because when I saw this on your Facebook
2359000	2361000	Which by the way I still need to like add you on Switch
2361000	2363000	I figured you would have just found me through the 3DS connection
2363000	2365000	Dan played it more than me already
2365000	2367000	Well I had each other eventually but
2367000	2369000	I assumed you bought one
2369000	2371000	My assumption was
2371000	2373000	Oh Mario Odyssey broke them
2373000	2375000	They finally got a Switch but you won it
2377000	2379000	I wasn't really supposed to say much about that
2379000	2381000	Oh sorry
2381000	2383000	But since no one knows where I work
2383000	2385000	So I did win it in a raffle
2385000	2387000	I was keeping it off
2387000	2389000	Social media for a reason
2389000	2391000	Oh sorry about that
2391000	2393000	Because some people do know where I work
2393000	2395000	I was in the raffle
2395000	2397000	They were doing cupcakes
2397000	2399000	At work
2399000	2401000	And I said you know what
2401000	2403000	I don't want a cupcake
2403000	2405000	Well I wanted a cupcake but I was being good
2405000	2407000	And I put my name in the raffle
2407000	2409000	One ticket in the raffle
2409000	2411000	Next thing I know look what you got
2411000	2413000	Wow
2413000	2415000	So I have a Switch
2415000	2417000	I had a Joy-Con with it in three games
2417000	2419000	There's no shame in that for the record
2419000	2421000	This is very common for any corporation to do
2421000	2423000	So you know this is common
2423000	2425000	But I still
2425000	2427000	Fair enough
2427000	2429000	So yeah
2429000	2431000	I have Arms, I have Breath of the Wild
2431000	2433000	And I have Mario Kart 8
2433000	2435000	And we are gonna put in our order
2435000	2437000	For Odyssey
2437000	2439000	Coming up
2439000	2441000	And it's been fun
2441000	2443000	But Dan decided he was gonna
2443000	2445000	Take over and play through Mario Kart 8
2445000	2447000	And then he got the demo for
2447000	2449000	Puyo Puyo Tetris
2449000	2451000	Because one of the things is that
2451000	2453000	I still
2453000	2455000	I read Japanese like maybe a semi-literate
2455000	2457000	Five year old
2457000	2459000	So going through Puyo Puyo Tetris
2459000	2461000	On PS4 was an adventure
2461000	2463000	And we eventually
2463000	2465000	Figured it out to where we could play against each other
2465000	2467000	And all that but Dan's like I can play it in English
2467000	2469000	Now meh
2469000	2471000	So here's the beauty of
2471000	2473000	A cartridge based world do you wanna just borrow my
2473000	2475000	Copy cause I rarely play it
2475000	2477000	Yeah if you guys really wanna play it just borrow my copy
2477000	2479000	Bring it back
2479000	2481000	This is like totally Playstation 4 type stuff here
2481000	2483000	You mean I can swap games without having to switch
2483000	2485000	Codes and being part of my family network
2485000	2487000	O M G
2487000	2489000	Yeah thank you
2489000	2491000	You're welcome
2491000	2493000	That'll be my makeup for Blabbing
2493000	2495000	Okay
2495000	2497000	But at any rate
2497000	2499000	It's been
2499000	2501000	It's been fun, the setup was super easy
2501000	2503000	I actually
2503000	2505000	I forgot my password but I could change it through Miitomo
2505000	2507000	Because it's linked to my Nintendo account
2507000	2509000	So it was pretty cool
2509000	2511000	I just put the picture up
2511000	2513000	Got requests already and I was like hey
2513000	2515000	This is sweet
2515000	2517000	So I've been having
2517000	2519000	We played a little bit of it but that means that I'm gonna start Breath of the Wild on my own
2519000	2521000	And not play over Dan's game which is on Wii U
2521000	2523000	Nice
2523000	2525000	So we have two copies of the same game on different systems
2525000	2527000	But it'll be interesting
2527000	2529000	Now you kind of spot those little differences maybe
2529000	2531000	Probably won't be much in the way of differences
2531000	2533000	Cause I don't think the Switch
2533000	2535000	Is that much more graphically
2535000	2537000	Advanced than the Wii U was
2537000	2539000	I don't think so either
2539000	2541000	I think
2541000	2543000	Everything looked really pretty though on our TV
2543000	2545000	Cause we have a 4K TV
2545000	2547000	And it was all clean and pretty
2547000	2549000	But Switch is only outputting
2549000	2551000	A 1080 top
2551000	2553000	It's all about using the emulator
2553000	2555000	To play that game
2555000	2557000	Cause then you can output some really good graphics
2557000	2559000	I did however
2559000	2561000	Look into the Breath of the Wild emulator
2561000	2563000	That they've got out there
2563000	2565000	Basically it's a Wii U emulator
2565000	2567000	But tweaked for Breath of the Wild
2567000	2569000	And so I've seen
2569000	2571000	I've actually gone on this kind of thing
2571000	2573000	For looking to see how the world was built
2573000	2575000	Cause I'm very interested in stuff like that
2575000	2577000	I mean you remember me in World of Warcraft
2577000	2579000	When we'd go do something and I'd stay in the instance
2579000	2581000	To just explore
2581000	2583000	You like to go do screenshots and stuff
2583000	2585000	You were big on that I remember
2585000	2587000	Well I haven't figured out how to do anything like that
2587000	2589000	In Final Fantasy XIV
2589000	2591000	I actually got my account fixed
2591000	2593000	Once I decide if I want to get the collector's edition
2593000	2595000	For Stormblood
2595000	2597000	Cause that's still $60
2597000	2599000	And I've got drag queens coming up
2599000	2601000	Hey
2601000	2603000	I'm buying both mine and Becky's tickets
2603000	2605000	I've got to pay her back for them
2605000	2607000	That's coming up in like two weeks
2607000	2609000	It is
2609000	2611000	And that weekend will be after
2611000	2613000	I have
2613000	2615000	Oh I'm not talking about that on the show either
2615000	2617000	More secrets
2617000	2619000	This one's a big secret but you know what it is
2619000	2621000	I think so yeah
2621000	2623000	Anything else for your gaming week?
2623000	2625000	I like
2625000	2627000	Cheese
2627000	2629000	Loki how was your gaming week?
2629000	2631000	I didn't play anything that I said I was going to play
2631000	2633000	What?
2633000	2635000	I know I got lazy
2635000	2637000	Oh well
2637000	2639000	I did end up playing a little bit of Minecraft
2639000	2641000	On Windows 10 the other day
2641000	2643000	Just to check out I really haven't played that in a long time
2643000	2645000	So it was a little bit different
2645000	2647000	And then
2647000	2649000	What else
2649000	2651000	I played some more of the stupid
2651000	2653000	Idol clicker game
2653000	2655000	For office space
2655000	2657000	Just because it's the thing to do
2657000	2659000	And
2659000	2661000	I
2661000	2663000	Don't think there's
2663000	2665000	Much else it was mostly updates
2665000	2667000	I had got everything cause I was gonna
2667000	2669000	I wanted to play VR and I was actually gonna go do that
2669000	2671000	The other day I had everything set up
2671000	2673000	And then all my controllers
2673000	2675000	Were dead
2675000	2677000	So I was like god dammit
2677000	2679000	So I finally charged everything but I still never
2679000	2681000	Got around to actually playing it again
2681000	2683000	But I have everything ready to go now
2683000	2685000	So I can bust out some VR games
2685000	2687000	From the PlayStation VR
2687000	2689000	Hopefully very soon and get all that stuff out of the way
2689000	2691000	Cause I have like 4 or 5 games that I've purchased
2691000	2693000	That I've been meaning to actually get to
2693000	2695000	But I haven't gotten to yet
2695000	2697000	So there's that and then
2697000	2699000	What else
2699000	2701000	Just reinstall some games on Steam
2701000	2703000	Cause it's gonna go play through some of that
2703000	2705000	Backlog stuff finally cause there's stuff on there
2705000	2707000	I'm like oh shit I forgot I have that
2707000	2709000	So yeah that's it
2709000	2711000	Alright my gaming week I have a lot
2711000	2713000	To catch up on so I was
2713000	2715000	A bit of a sheep I guess some of you want to call me
2715000	2717000	And I got an iPhone 10
2717000	2719000	But before you bring the sheep
2719000	2721000	Emojis at me here's the thing
2721000	2723000	I use my phone more than any other device
2723000	2725000	And the phone I was using
2725000	2727000	Was 3 years old so you know what
2727000	2729000	I'm worth it I earned it
2730000	2731000	Treat yo self
2731000	2733000	Exactly treat yo self
2733000	2735000	And it is a nice piece of hardware
2735000	2737000	So I'm a fan so far
2737000	2739000	I think the animojis are kinda dumb
2739000	2741000	But Jamie did laugh
2741000	2743000	When I sent her the unicorn talking
2743000	2745000	I finally listened to it when I got home
2745000	2747000	Cause I was at work
2747000	2749000	But it popped up on
2749000	2751000	You know I'm looking at my messenger right now
2751000	2753000	And it pops up on my
2753000	2755000	Mac
2755000	2757000	And it actually saves them as little movies
2757000	2759000	So I can quite literally drag
2759000	2761000	It out to my desktop
2761000	2763000	Like I could with all of those Retsuko stickers I got
2763000	2765000	That's how I put one on Twitter
2765000	2767000	I sent it to
2767000	2769000	Alan even though he doesn't have an iPhone
2769000	2771000	I sent it to him and it just sent him a video
2771000	2773000	But I saved it to my own phone
2773000	2775000	And then I posted it to Twitter
2775000	2777000	I posted something stupid on Twitter
2777000	2779000	Why can't you just directly share those
2779000	2781000	To social media
2781000	2783000	Apple?
2783000	2785000	You might be able to I just didn't look into it
2785000	2787000	But the animoji isn't a separate program
2787000	2789000	It's built into the messenger
2791000	2793000	But if you're using SMS
2793000	2795000	It converts it to a video format
2795000	2797000	I did not buy the phone to be a talking unicorn
2797000	2799000	And yes I picked the unicorn
2799000	2801000	Because everybody else is picking the poop
2801000	2803000	Which is stupid
2803000	2805000	So I'm the unicorn which is awesome
2805000	2807000	And the first thing that comes out of this unicorn
2807000	2809000	Hey girl
2809000	2811000	I'm like
2811000	2813000	Oh Rob
2813000	2815000	Eyes detected
2815000	2817000	So anyway I've been playing more
2817000	2819000	Pokemon Go on that
2819000	2821000	Because it runs so good
2821000	2823000	And as a congratulations on your
2823000	2825000	Dumb new phone gift
2825000	2827000	Alan got me a gotcha
2827000	2829000	Which is like the Pokemon Go Plus
2829000	2831000	But you don't even have to push the fucking button
2831000	2833000	You just walk
2833000	2835000	And it plays the game for you
2835000	2837000	Which is awesome
2837000	2839000	Yes it's so easy
2839000	2841000	It's just you know
2841000	2843000	My Apple Watch will do that
2843000	2845000	But you don't even
2845000	2847000	Like do you have to tap the Apple Watch
2847000	2849000	I haven't honestly played with my Apple Watch
2849000	2851000	You used to have to tap it
2851000	2853000	But I think you can do a setting on it now
2853000	2855000	But the thing that I like about having Pokemon Go
2855000	2857000	On my Apple Watch though
2857000	2859000	Is that I don't have to have my phone out
2859000	2861000	You know just walk around
2861000	2863000	Kossin in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says
2863000	2865000	My computer is over 9 years old
2865000	2867000	Guess that means I should buy an AMD Vega
2867000	2869000	Sure go for it
2869000	2871000	If you can afford it do it
2871000	2873000	Slay mama
2873000	2875000	Like
2875000	2877000	If you're surprised that that's my answer
2877000	2879000	Then maybe you don't understand why I got the phone
2879000	2881000	Enabler, enabler
2881000	2883000	SSG100 Matt says
2883000	2885000	I was gonna ask how fast does Pogo
2885000	2887000	Play on the X
2887000	2889000	I feel like it's the way it's supposed to be
2889000	2891000	I can't help but say X
2891000	2893000	Anyway, Mortal Kombat
2893000	2895000	Mortal Kombat ruined it for me
2895000	2897000	All right fancy ruined it for you
2897000	2899000	You can help it
2899000	2901000	All right anyway
2901000	2903000	So anyway other stuff I've been playing
2903000	2905000	Not just on the new phone
2905000	2907000	I have been playing
2907000	2909000	More Heroes of the Storm
2909000	2911000	Like that is like my online game right now
2911000	2913000	I am still playing a crap ton of Heroes of the Storm
2913000	2915000	I'll play it with you, I love that game
2915000	2917000	I suck at it
2917000	2919000	Like 90% of what I play is AI
2919000	2921000	Just to do my quest
2921000	2923000	But I will say I finally
2923000	2925000	Just like sucked it up
2925000	2927000	And I was like okay I'm getting pretty good with
2927000	2929000	Morales who's a healer character
2929000	2931000	I'm feeling like I got a good energy
2931000	2933000	With her, I got MVP in a game
2933000	2935000	So I was like I'm gonna try a real game with Morales
2935000	2937000	And I did and I went in the real game
2937000	2939000	And we won and
2939000	2941000	The toxic Heroes of the Storm community
2941000	2943000	Even complimented me on my healing
2943000	2945000	So now my ego is like
2945000	2947000	Woo I can do this
2947000	2949000	I'm gonna be a Heroes of the Storm champion
2949000	2951000	Cause I'm the Morales king
2951000	2953000	So now I'm playing more online
2953000	2955000	So yeah
2955000	2957000	I'm playing a little bit more
2957000	2959000	I'll do the quest to kind of screw around
2959000	2961000	With other characters and stuff
2961000	2963000	But then if I'm gonna play a hero I'm really comfortable with
2963000	2965000	I have been doing more quick matches
2965000	2967000	So that's been a little bit of that
2967000	2969000	But I wanna talk about new games I've been playing
2969000	2971000	So I didn't get to talk about them last week
2971000	2973000	So now I can talk about them this week after I've played them more
2973000	2975000	I've been playing Destiny 2 on PC
2975000	2977000	So I bought that
2977000	2979000	And I started playing that when it came out
2979000	2981000	And I gotta tell you guys
2981000	2983000	The game is gorgeous
2983000	2985000	It looks so good
2985000	2987000	Now I'm not able to play 4K's
2987000	2989000	I didn't buy the AMD Vega
2989000	2991000	That I just told Casa to go buy
2991000	2993000	So I have a video card that's a couple years old
2993000	2995000	So I can't play in 4K
2995000	2997000	But I can play in
2997000	2999000	Some resolution that's like 1440
2999000	3001000	So it's a little higher than 1080p
3001000	3003000	Just ever so slightly
3003000	3005000	But like
3005000	3007000	Isn't that like 2K?
3007000	3009000	I think it might be 2K
3009000	3011000	So yeah
3011000	3013000	And just
3013000	3015000	Like the environments in Destiny 2
3015000	3017000	Are a lot more varied than they were in the first game
3017000	3019000	So I just, yeah
3019000	3021000	The game looks awesome
3021000	3023000	But it's fun to play too
3023000	3025000	I'm not usually huge on first person shooters
3025000	3027000	But with Destiny being a little bit more like
3027000	3029000	I don't wanna say RPG-ish
3029000	3031000	But that's kinda how it feels when you have quests
3031000	3033000	And the fact that people can drop in and out
3033000	3035000	Like your buddy Crystal
3035000	3037000	Has been playing matches with me on PC
3037000	3039000	And Crystal will join matches
3039000	3041000	And we'll just go do stuff
3041000	3043000	And then it's like, okay we did a quest
3043000	3045000	I gotta go
3045000	3047000	I like that whole drop in and out
3047000	3049000	That you can help other people type of thing
3049000	3051000	That's really cool
3051000	3053000	And then my buddy Delvin, shout out Video Game Realness
3053000	3055000	My pal over there who hosts that show
3055000	3057000	He was playing with me on some matches as well
3057000	3059000	And we were both swooning over Sniper Daddy
3059000	3061000	So there it is
3061000	3063000	So Destiny, I'm
3063000	3065000	Liking way more than I thought I would
3065000	3067000	And again the visuals
3067000	3069000	At least on PC
3069000	3071000	I haven't been playing it on console so I couldn't tell you how it compares
3071000	3073000	But it looks
3073000	3075000	So good on PC
3075000	3077000	But again you wanna make sure you have a video card
3077000	3079000	That can at least handle it
3079000	3081000	But mine's a couple years old and is doing okay
3081000	3083000	And if you're gonna be that guy that goes get that brand new AMD card
3083000	3085000	Then hey, I bet 4K is gonna look gorgeous
3085000	3087000	So there you go
3087000	3089000	Dungeon Buster in Chat says
3089000	3091000	I've heard a lot of good things about Destiny 2's
3091000	3093000	Optimization from PC people
3093000	3095000	Yeah, there's no frame rate cap
3095000	3097000	So
3097000	3099000	I probably could play on 4K
3099000	3101000	But my frame rate would be like 20
3101000	3103000	So by dipping it down a little bit
3103000	3105000	I'm able to have a really smooth experience
3105000	3107000	And I really really like it
3107000	3109000	So JD says
3109000	3111000	Sniper Daddy, yes
3111000	3113000	I don't wanna give too many spoileries away
3113000	3115000	But in the first area
3115000	3117000	The guy that you kinda turn Quest into
3117000	3119000	Is a Sniper Daddy
3119000	3121000	And he's voiced by, here's the thing
3121000	3123000	He's voiced by Gideon Emery
3123000	3125000	Who
3125000	3127000	Balthier, Fenris
3127000	3129000	Yeah, Fenris
3129000	3131000	And the thing is that Gideon Emery
3131000	3133000	Never changes his voice
3133000	3135000	For the characters, but there's a reason for that
3137000	3139000	Everybody is just fine with the voice
3139000	3141000	That God gave him
3141000	3143000	So there's that
3143000	3145000	Just give me a character name so I can Google fan art
3145000	3147000	I don't remember the character's name
3147000	3149000	I've been calling him nothing but Sniper Daddy
3149000	3151000	Somebody in chat knows
3151000	3153000	The name
3153000	3155000	Help JD and I out
3155000	3157000	I don't remember the name of the character
3157000	3159000	That's kind of embarrassing
3159000	3161000	One other game that I've been playing
3161000	3163000	An awful lot of is
3163000	3165000	Not as much as some of my friends
3165000	3167000	Cause I haven't beat it yet
3167000	3169000	But I feel like I'm getting really close
3169000	3171000	Super Mario Odyssey on the Nintendo Switch
3171000	3173000	I bought that game when it came out
3173000	3175000	And I've been playing quite a bit of Super Mario Odyssey
3175000	3177000	And you guys, I love it
3177000	3179000	It's just like
3179000	3181000	If you don't like Super Mario Odyssey
3181000	3183000	I would really want to know the why
3183000	3185000	Because I just feel like
3185000	3187000	There's just so much fun
3187000	3189000	And Super Mario Odyssey
3189000	3191000	Just makes me smile
3191000	3193000	Now I don't want to spoil too bad
3193000	3195000	But there was one part in the game in particular
3195000	3197000	Like everybody knows from the trailers
3197000	3199000	New Donk City, right?
3199000	3201000	So those that have played the game will know
3201000	3203000	That there's a certain moment in the new Donk City
3203000	3205000	When you're playing it
3205000	3207000	A celebration of sorts
3207000	3209000	And everybody that's played the game is going to know what I'm talking about here
3209000	3211000	So like when I was going through that whole sequence
3211000	3213000	I was like
3213000	3215000	This is just
3215000	3217000	This is fucking awesome
3217000	3219000	Like there's just
3219000	3221000	This is how playing video games should feel
3221000	3223000	All the time, every time
3223000	3225000	This is a fucking delight
3225000	3227000	What I'm doing right now
3227000	3229000	And I wish every video game felt like this
3229000	3231000	And that's where I'm at with Super Mario Odyssey
3231000	3233000	Are there small nitpicky imperfections
3233000	3235000	I could maybe get into about the game?
3235000	3237000	Sure, it looks a little
3237000	3239000	I think it looks cheaper when it's off the dock
3239000	3241000	Than it does in the dock
3241000	3243000	Like I noticed some of the problems and some of the frame rate issue
3243000	3245000	But honestly, it's so fucking minor
3245000	3247000	It doesn't matter because the game
3247000	3249000	Is extraordinarily fucking fun
3249000	3251000	And that is like
3251000	3253000	I just love that when I go into a new level
3253000	3255000	Like all of a sudden there'll be some
3255000	3257000	Dippy new mini game that's so adorable
3257000	3259000	That I'll have to play
3259000	3261000	Like I just went to Snow World
3261000	3263000	And the only racing thing you have to do
3263000	3265000	Is these fat little walruses
3265000	3267000	That you have to like bounce
3267000	3269000	Because you're a fat fucking walrus
3269000	3271000	And you have to bounce around
3271000	3273000	It's so adorable
3273000	3275000	You do like your test cars
3275000	3277000	I do
3277000	3279000	Mario Odyssey kind of has their version of that
3279000	3281000	And it's super adorable
3281000	3283000	Dark Tetsuya in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says
3283000	3285000	Like Breath of the Wild did
3285000	3287000	For the Zelda games
3287000	3289000	Yeah, actually Mario Odyssey
3289000	3291000	Is a lot like Breath of the Wild
3291000	3293000	In some ways
3293000	3295000	Not totally, I mean there's a little more structure to it
3295000	3297000	You go from zone to zone
3297000	3299000	But like the freedom to do whatever you want
3299000	3301000	In those zones
3301000	3303000	Or let's look behind this wall
3303000	3305000	Because there might be a moon
3305000	3307000	It's just like Mario 64
3307000	3309000	It is, and honestly it's the most Mario 64
3309000	3311000	It's probably the best Mario game since Mario 64
3311000	3313000	And I even thought
3313000	3315000	At the time Mario 64
3315000	3317000	Was kind of overrated
3317000	3319000	And that's because I had a very hard time
3319000	3321000	Shifting from 3D to 2D
3321000	3323000	And I think a lot of gamers of a certain age
3323000	3325000	Kind of went through this
3325000	3327000	So Mario 3D was a little harder for me to get into at the time
3327000	3329000	And believe me guys
3329000	3331000	I loved Mario Sunshine
3331000	3333000	I loved Mario Galaxy
3333000	3335000	I think Mario Galaxy was my game of the year
3335000	3337000	The year that game came out
3337000	3339000	Odyssey is even better
3339000	3341000	Like this is Mario at the top of his game
3341000	3343000	And I couldn't be happier
3343000	3345000	If you own a Switch
3345000	3347000	You're getting this game done
3347000	3349000	Like there's no, is there a debate
3349000	3351000	Why would you own a Switch
3351000	3353000	And not own Mario Odyssey
3353000	3355000	I just, I don't know
3355000	3357000	You would have to hate platformers
3357000	3359000	Or really only be into it for a certain game or something
3359000	3361000	But just like
3361000	3363000	If you even remotely enjoy Mario games
3363000	3365000	Mario Odyssey is fucking great
3365000	3367000	And I would say
3367000	3369000	Go for it
3369000	3371000	So orange right in chat says
3371000	3373000	My entire gaming week was Mario Odyssey
3373000	3375000	Are there bushes to hide in in the desert?
3375000	3377000	Well that was a question
3377000	3379000	For Dungeon Buster
3379000	3381000	I guess about, oh, hiding
3381000	3383000	Being Assassin's Creed-ing across Egypt
3383000	3385000	There are some different kind of
3385000	3387000	Mechanics where you can kind of hide in things
3387000	3389000	And parts where 3D turns
3389000	3391000	Into 2D and it's really cool
3391000	3393000	And guess what I got today
3393000	3395000	In the mail that I'm really excited to play
3395000	3397000	Well in the mail, UPS from Amazon
3397000	3399000	I got my Princess Peach wedding emoji
3399000	3401000	So you know what that means guys
3401000	3403000	Mario wedding dress time
3403000	3405000	Woohoo
3405000	3407000	Dark Sakura
3407000	3409000	It's like rolling her eyes
3409000	3411000	Mario drag
3411000	3413000	Have you seen the pictures of Mario
3413000	3415000	It's just like
3415000	3417000	How can you hate it
3417000	3419000	It's so funny
3419000	3421000	Like cute
3421000	3423000	It's just great
3423000	3425000	Those pictures of Mario in a wedding dress
3425000	3427000	Running away from a Goomba
3427000	3429000	It's everything that Mario Odyssey
3429000	3431000	I love it
3431000	3433000	Alright
3433000	3435000	Anyway, Dungeon Buster in chat says
3435000	3437000	I own a Switch but don't have Odyssey
3437000	3439000	Yet, well yeah
3439000	3441000	But it's on your agenda
3441000	3443000	Like obviously there's gonna be people that are like
3443000	3445000	I don't have the finances for 60 bucks right now
3445000	3447000	But I will by the holidays
3447000	3449000	It's on everybody's radar for sure
3449000	3451000	So there you go
3451000	3453000	Alright
3453000	3455000	So yeah, Mario Odyssey
3455000	3457000	My highest recommendation of that game
3457000	3459000	I'm loving it
3459000	3461000	I've had a very good gaming week
3461000	3463000	These are all good games that I'm talking about
3463000	3465000	Heroes of the Storm, Destiny 2
3465000	3467000	It's a great fucking time to be a gamer
3467000	3469000	Housekeeping
3469000	3471000	I already mentioned we won't be here next week
3471000	3473000	That's a pre-planned night off
3473000	3475000	Sorry about that
3475000	3477000	Follow us on Twitter
3477000	3479000	You can also do Facebook
3479000	3481000	And Discord
3481000	3483000	So I'll tell you this now
3483000	3485000	Stay tuned tonight
3485000	3487000	I thought what a nice apology
3487000	3489000	would be tonight
3489000	3491000	Let's do something, and I looked, do you know it's been over
3491000	3493000	a year since we've done this on our show
3493000	3495000	We're gonna bring back a segment
3495000	3497000	that I know you guys love
3497000	3499000	We're gonna have ourselves a list list tonight
3499000	3501000	So stay tuned
3501000	3503000	List list coming up in part B
3503000	3505000	I'll tell you the topic later
3505000	3507000	But it has to do with one of our news stories tonight
3507000	3509000	So I think we need to get into the news
3509000	3511000	So we can get to the list list topic
3511000	3513000	Right, Loki? Let's get into
3513000	3515000	the news
3515000	3517000	So let's talk a little bit about it on Paris
3517000	3519000	Games Week
3519000	3521000	So they have that big
3521000	3523000	I don't know if you call it a press conference
3523000	3525000	trailer sizzle reel I guess
3525000	3527000	Where they showed off a bunch of new things
3527000	3529000	from Sony
3529000	3531000	One of the big IPs they were showing off
3531000	3533000	was actually a game called
3533000	3535000	Ghosts of Tsushima
3535000	3537000	Which is a brand new game
3537000	3539000	from Sucker Punch
3539000	3541000	And it kind of looks like
3541000	3543000	a Ninja Gaiden just based off the
3543000	3545000	small bit of gameplay that they had
3545000	3547000	But it basically takes place in feudal
3547000	3549000	Japan with
3549000	3551000	Samurais
3551000	3553000	So it looks pretty cool
3553000	3555000	So that's something I'm definitely wanting to check out
3555000	3557000	whenever that comes out
3557000	3559000	They also showed off
3559000	3561000	some other stuff including
3561000	3563000	Let's see
3563000	3565000	They had this game called Erica
3565000	3567000	Which is gonna be using that
3567000	3569000	The
3569000	3571000	PlayStation integration, the play link
3571000	3573000	with your phone
3573000	3575000	So basically you can kind of
3575000	3577000	pick, it almost looks like a choose
3577000	3579000	your own adventure type thing
3579000	3581000	Where she's trying to figure out some sort of mystery
3581000	3583000	that's going on, try to piece together
3583000	3585000	like a puzzle or something
3585000	3587000	Kind of have that quantum
3587000	3589000	or not quantum break, the
3589000	3591000	quadratic dream
3591000	3593000	type look to it
3593000	3595000	but you know, live action and everything
3595000	3597000	Interesting
3597000	3599000	I guess, I don't know, not my type of game
3599000	3601000	but it is a neat
3601000	3603000	neat idea to use the phones and everything
3603000	3605000	Plus I guess one of the gimmicks of it
3605000	3607000	is you're gonna be able to draw in the world
3607000	3609000	or touch the world, they said
3609000	3611000	So it's gonna be using your touch screen
3611000	3613000	Touch the world
3613000	3615000	This game actually looked pretty awesome
3615000	3617000	I feel like that should be a commercial
3617000	3619000	that airs during the Jerry Springer
3619000	3621000	show
3621000	3623000	Pick up the phone, touch
3623000	3625000	my world
3625000	3627000	So there's
3627000	3629000	another game called Onrush
3629000	3631000	which is like this off-road
3631000	3633000	racing kind of
3633000	3635000	cross with like
3635000	3637000	burnout type of game
3637000	3639000	So it's a very fast paced, you know
3639000	3641000	smashing the cars and stuff like that
3641000	3643000	games gonna be coming out from Ubisoft
3643000	3645000	on the Playstation 4 and it looks pretty awesome
3645000	3647000	so definitely
3647000	3649000	one I'm willing to pick up since
3649000	3651000	I love me some burnout
3651000	3653000	and then
3653000	3655000	one of the things that they also announced
3655000	3657000	that with the new Monster Hunter World
3657000	3659000	you're actually gonna be able to play as Aloy
3659000	3661000	from Horizon Zero Dawn
3661000	3663000	with the Playstation 4 version
3663000	3665000	so that's kind of neat for fans of that
3665000	3667000	of course they also talked about the expansion
3667000	3669000	that they have for that game
3669000	3671000	then they've gotta
3671000	3673000	please buy Monster Hunter World
3673000	3675000	cause our company's in a lot of trouble
3675000	3677000	we need this game to be a success
3677000	3679000	well
3679000	3681000	I guess, yeah
3681000	3683000	and then of course
3683000	3685000	there's some new Playstation VR titles
3685000	3687000	they had one that kind of looked
3687000	3689000	a little bit like a spinoff of the
3689000	3691000	gangster, like a London gangster
3691000	3693000	thing that they had in Playstation World
3693000	3695000	but it's this
3695000	3697000	game called Blood and Truth
3697000	3699000	and I guess it's just
3699000	3701000	you know, kind of throwing you into like
3701000	3703000	some sort of modern
3703000	3705000	like, I don't even really say it's like
3705000	3707000	gangster, more
3707000	3709000	it might even be like a Mission Impossible type thing
3709000	3711000	or something like that
3711000	3713000	so lots of gunplay and stuff
3713000	3715000	and then
3715000	3717000	what else
3717000	3719000	they had another game that was kind of lame looking
3719000	3721000	though that I was not interested in
3721000	3723000	but lots of VR stuff that they were announcing
3723000	3725000	so that was kind of cool
3725000	3727000	and then finally the last thing they had a game called
3727000	3729000	Ore
3729000	3731000	and it came out actually
3731000	3733000	that day when they announced it
3733000	3735000	and it kind of resembles like
3735000	3737000	a
3737000	3739000	game company game
3739000	3741000	they couldn't say made by that game
3741000	3743000	company or anything like that but they could say
3743000	3745000	in the style of Journey and
3745000	3747000	Flow brings this new adventure
3747000	3749000	and I heard the reviews were only mediocre
3749000	3751000	I didn't play it myself
3751000	3753000	I hear it didn't play that well but it looks similar
3753000	3755000	to that, you know the same kind of art style
3755000	3757000	which I mean
3757000	3759000	Journey was
3759000	3761000	hands down like one of the greatest
3761000	3763000	video gaming experiences of the past
3763000	3765000	ten years, like no question
3765000	3767000	Journey is up there, so it's
3767000	3769000	like it's no surprise we're seeing
3769000	3771000	games inspired by Journey
3771000	3773000	because it deserves that
3773000	3775000	It did look kind of neat though because it almost
3775000	3777000	reminded me of a shooter almost
3777000	3779000	it seemed like a lot of bullet dodging and stuff like that
3779000	3781000	so there was that, it's about this boy
3781000	3783000	kind of can transform into this dragon
3783000	3785000	like a Chinese dragon
3785000	3787000	so it was neat
3787000	3789000	I don't know, I would just check out the trailer
3789000	3791000	see if something that you might be interested in
3791000	3793000	check them out but
3793000	3795000	that's pretty much the major stuff that they announced
3795000	3797000	during Paris Game Week
3797000	3799000	Interesting that they announced a lot here because
3799000	3801000	Sony still has PSX
3801000	3803000	coming up in the early December
3803000	3805000	now I thought I saw some tweet
3805000	3807000	and I don't know if this is you know
3807000	3809000	take tweets with a grain of salt
3809000	3811000	but I heard that Sony shifted
3811000	3813000	some of what they were going to announce at PSX
3813000	3815000	to this
3815000	3817000	so some people are saying lower your expectations
3817000	3819000	for PSX but that
3819000	3821000	seems strange
3821000	3823000	the stuff that we kind of mentioned
3823000	3825000	was just the new stuff but they also had
3825000	3827000	more trailers for different
3827000	3829000	games that have already been announced
3829000	3831000	like God of War had a gameplay trailer
3831000	3833000	they looked alright, they showed
3833000	3835000	the redone intro for
3835000	3837000	Shadow of the Colossus
3837000	3839000	that remake
3839000	3841000	which looked pretty gorgeous
3841000	3843000	so do you think PSX is going to focus on
3843000	3845000	here's an update on Final Fantasy 7 remake
3845000	3847000	well they have that
3847000	3849000	they have that other zombie game that's supposed to be
3849000	3851000	coming up that they kind of showed a little bit of
3851000	3853000	before
3853000	3855000	there's still they can do another
3855000	3857000	I think they showed the Last of Us 2
3857000	3859000	trailer as well
3859000	3861000	so they could always do more of that
3861000	3863000	they could show hopefully
3863000	3865000	I'm hoping at this point you know especially since
3865000	3867000	you know their chummy
3867000	3869000	and everything we'll see a new Death Stranding
3869000	3871000	trailer so
3871000	3873000	yeah so maybe I guess you're right all those things they could
3873000	3875000	kind of quote unquote get away with
3875000	3877000	honestly the PSX
3877000	3879000	conference could be three minutes
3879000	3881000	long and a win and all they have
3881000	3883000	to do is come out and say well we know
3883000	3885000	you've been asking for it so we finally
3885000	3887000	changed our mind of backwards compatibility
3887000	3889000	PS1, 2 and 3 games available
3889000	3891000	today have fun like that could be it
3891000	3893000	and everybody would be like fuck yeah PSX
3893000	3895000	was the best year ever
3895000	3897000	old shit is new again
3897000	3899000	they're never going to do that though they're not going to do that until they're in
3899000	3901000	second place it's just frustrating when you're watching
3901000	3903000	like Microsoft over here going
3903000	3905000	we're going to take original Xbox games
3905000	3907000	and make them in 4K and like
3907000	3909000	meanwhile Sony's like
3909000	3911000	they're not thinking they're like thinking well PlayStation 4
3911000	3913000	is so fucking strong and everything
3913000	3915000	right this generation
3915000	3917000	but then you look at like when the new consoles
3917000	3919000	come out and you think hmm you know the PlayStation
3919000	3921000	4 didn't really have all that mod support
3921000	3923000	that I liked that the other one had oh hey
3923000	3925000	you know what those exclusives weren't so great
3925000	3927000	that was it you know
3927000	3929000	those games that I was really like banking
3929000	3931000	on that were going to be really great games maybe
3931000	3933000	I will go back over there and you know
3933000	3935000	do Microsoft instead and that's kind of where
3935000	3937000	it was like this time around because
3937000	3939000	I don't know PlayStation 4 looked like
3939000	3941000	it had some really great exclusives but then some of
3941000	3943000	those games just turn out to be kind of garbage
3943000	3945000	well yeah SSU100Matt in chat says yeah
3945000	3947000	I'm not expecting any blockbuster stuff from PSX
3947000	3949000	show but they like well you
3949000	3951000	you mentioned that Loki Street Fighter
3951000	3953000	5 was a PSX announcement
3953000	3955000	now at the time that was a pretty
3955000	3957000	fucking big deal now obviously the game came
3957000	3959000	out and it's
3959000	3961000	controversial we'll leave it at that they're
3961000	3963000	trying to salvage what they can with that
3963000	3965000	but at the time still the fact that
3965000	3967000	Street Fighter 5 was coming and it's
3967000	3969000	PlayStation and PC only
3969000	3971000	and not none for you
3971000	3973000	Xbox go home that was a pretty big
3973000	3975000	deal that's the thing about those both those conferences
3975000	3977000	and stuff and like especially these major game
3977000	3979000	announcements are like this console and
3979000	3981000	PC exclusives like fuck yeah
3981000	3983000	I'm a winner on PC woo I can get all of
3983000	3985000	this you know that's kind
3985000	3987000	of like what that's that was that was
3987000	3989000	me Microsoft E3 yeah exactly
3989000	3991000	it's really kind of the big thing that's kind of
3991000	3993000	kept me away from an Xbox one because
3993000	3995000	I don't feel that I need to have a system
3995000	3997000	for these games like man I
3997000	3999000	really want to play Forza wait I have a PC
3999000	4001000	that can run that and they have it on PC
4001000	4003000	so I don't need the buyer console
4003000	4005000	but yeah I you know hope that there's
4005000	4007000	other games that'd be worthwhile but
4007000	4009000	there really is not a lot of
4009000	4011000	exclusives that's why I kind of been just like eh
4011000	4013000	I'm not really jumping in you know
4013000	4015000	to getting multiple consoles right now of course
4015000	4017000	a Switch later because Nintendo's never gonna put stuff
4017000	4019000	on PC although they do
4019000	4021000	be fucking awesome come on
4021000	4023000	emulators eventually
4023000	4025000	well anyway
4025000	4027000	yeah I'm gonna temper my expectations
4027000	4029000	for PSX but I still
4029000	4031000	there'll be a surprise or two there's gonna
4031000	4033000	be some big game they're gonna unveil to get
4033000	4035000	the fans hyped because this is their chance
4035000	4037000	to get things in front of the fans I don't think it's out
4037000	4039000	of the question that maybe we'll get something
4039000	4041000	playable
4041000	4043000	for Final Fantasy 7 remake
4043000	4045000	or for Kingdom Hearts 3
4045000	4047000	like something out of the Square Enix camp
4047000	4049000	Kingdom Hearts 3 has got to fucking
4049000	4051000	come out at some point right?
4051000	4053000	yeah I'm like these games are supposed to be coming out
4053000	4055000	some day
4055000	4057000	like I
4057000	4059000	one of those games has to come out 2018
4059000	4061000	Crackdown's gotta come out some
4061000	4063000	day I know it's not
4063000	4065000	Sony but Jesus Christ man
4065000	4067000	that was gonna be the game that was gonna
4067000	4069000	sell me on that console and now I'm like
4069000	4071000	eh I would think Final Fantasy
4071000	4073000	remake part 1 is coming 2018
4073000	4075000	like because again they split that game
4075000	4077000	into parts and we've already seen
4077000	4079000	the trailers that show that game in motion
4079000	4081000	in Midgar
4081000	4083000	you know some of the opening scenes was like
4083000	4085000	and that was a year ago so
4085000	4087000	I would think we're closer than
4087000	4089000	I mean again
4089000	4091000	I'm not gonna get my hopes that high up
4091000	4093000	but I would think Final Fantasy 7 remake part 1
4093000	4095000	is close
4095000	4097000	I still have to play through 15
4097000	4099000	15 was a game I was really excited for
4099000	4101000	well if you play 15 that's gonna be the same engine
4101000	4103000	that Final Fantasy 7 remake is running in
4103000	4105000	so you'll get an idea what to expect
4105000	4107000	alright
4107000	4109000	S.H.O.N. and Matt in chat says to be clear
4109000	4111000	I'm not expecting any sort of Kingdom Hearts 3
4111000	4113000	Shenmue or Final Fantasy 7
4113000	4115000	remake news alright that's
4115000	4117000	don't go in expecting
4117000	4119000	any of that that way if it does show up
4119000	4121000	you'll be pleasantly surprised
4121000	4123000	all C-Man
4123000	4125000	go expecting
4125000	4127000	nothing but C-Man
4127000	4129000	one publisher
4129000	4131000	that won't be showing up at a Nintendo conference
4131000	4133000	anytime soon likely is EA
4133000	4135000	cause EA has mentioned this week
4135000	4137000	you know we're not really in a rush
4137000	4139000	to make more video games for the Nintendo
4139000	4141000	Switch you might remember that EA
4141000	4143000	kind of has tested the Nintendo Switch
4143000	4145000	with FIFA 18 being out there
4145000	4147000	on the platform I would assume
4147000	4149000	this game's doing alright but in a
4149000	4151000	recent I guess this was an interview
4151000	4153000	with the Wall Street Journal since we are talking about
4153000	4155000	finances the finance chief
4155000	4157000	Blake Jorgensen said
4157000	4159000	that basically
4159000	4161000	they want to wait
4161000	4163000	for the Switch to be on the market a full
4163000	4165000	year before deciding whether
4165000	4167000	to release more games besides
4167000	4169000	just FIFA 18
4169000	4171000	they want to wait to quote
4171000	4173000	fully understand what the demand is
4173000	4175000	for Switch before committing more
4175000	4177000	resources to it
4177000	4179000	it's just cost versus return
4179000	4181000	on creating another engine because
4181000	4183000	Frostbite doesn't run on it that's really what it
4183000	4185000	comes down to and I'm guessing that they probably just
4185000	4187000	converted because I still think
4187000	4189000	that they have legacy versions coming out
4189000	4191000	on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 still
4191000	4193000	for FIFA it's one of the few games that they
4193000	4195000	have that still because in certain regions
4195000	4197000	they don't have the newer systems or they're
4197000	4199000	not readily available so that's probably why
4199000	4201000	they converted FIFA is because they have
4201000	4203000	the older engine that they're adapting to
4203000	4205000	it but they're not going to
4205000	4207000	that's why they're waiting it's got to be a
4207000	4209000	runaway success before they want to sink money
4209000	4211000	into it I'm going to tell you what it is cause
4211000	4213000	my husband hit the nail on the head with this
4213000	4215000	first thing out of his mouth he said
4215000	4217000	oh this is because Nintendo is challenged
4217000	4219000	when it comes to online
4219000	4221000	and EA wants that sweet loot box
4221000	4223000	money that's and I was like
4223000	4225000	you're right you're absolutely right
4225000	4227000	Nintendo still hasn't unveiled
4227000	4229000	what their full plan for online is
4229000	4231000	that's what's holding EA back
4231000	4233000	I don't think so I think they could still implement
4233000	4235000	loot boxes if they wanted to they have
4235000	4237000	does FIFA 18 have loot boxes? yes
4237000	4239000	they've got the ready
4239000	4241000	they've got the
4241000	4243000	what do they call it?
4243000	4245000	it's like the team thing that they have
4245000	4247000	they've had those loot boxes for FIFA for a long time
4247000	4249000	the player cards or whatever they call them
4249000	4251000	I forget the something team
4251000	4253000	I don't remember what it's called
4253000	4255000	well that's been around forever that's why everybody got their accounts on their Xbox 360
4255000	4257000	or something like that yeah
4257000	4259000	so it's been around forever so they've had
4259000	4261000	they had loot boxes and that type of stuff
4261000	4263000	for the longest time
4263000	4265000	JD in chat says
4265000	4267000	to be honest if EA had any sense
4267000	4269000	they would port Bejeweled to
4269000	4271000	Switch yeah I mean
4271000	4273000	EA has that PopCap kind of casual
4273000	4275000	arm is PopCap still open or did
4275000	4277000	EA close it? I think they closed it
4277000	4279000	fuck EA if they did that but I remember
4279000	4281000	PopCap did a lot more of those
4281000	4283000	no because they're still making Plants vs. Zombies
4283000	4285000	and Pagle games
4285000	4287000	I think they're still around but
4287000	4289000	they're not kind of what they used to be
4289000	4291000	under EA which you know
4291000	4293000	but anyway
4293000	4295000	but still I mean
4295000	4297000	you would think that those types of more
4297000	4299000	casual games would do very
4299000	4301000	well on something like Switch
4301000	4303000	oh by the way in a related
4303000	4305000	update the Nintendo Switch
4305000	4307000	has sold 7.6
4307000	4309000	million units
4309000	4311000	doomed for failure
4311000	4313000	total failure
4313000	4315000	7.6 million Switch units
4315000	4317000	as of September 2017
4317000	4319000	already more than half the
4319000	4321000	sales of the Wii U in its
4321000	4323000	entire lifetime
4323000	4325000	this includes 4.7
4325000	4327000	million Zelda Breath of the Wild
4327000	4329000	4.4 Mario Kart 8
4329000	4331000	3.6
4331000	4333000	Splatoon 2
4335000	4337000	and speaking of
4337000	4339000	sales Super Mario
4339000	4341000	Odyssey 2
4341000	4343000	million copies in 3 days
4343000	4345000	that's per Nintendo's estimate
4345000	4347000	that includes bundles
4347000	4349000	digital sales but
4349000	4351000	still 2 million copies in 3 days
4351000	4353000	there ain't a lot of games pushing
4353000	4355000	numbers like that so it does
4355000	4357000	put an interesting sort of
4357000	4359000	when you put that next to EA's
4359000	4361000	we're gonna wait and see how the Switch does
4361000	4363000	uh ya boners
4363000	4365000	the Switch is doing just fine
4365000	4367000	if you would just figure
4367000	4369000	out what you are gonna put on this system
4369000	4371000	EA doesn't make games like Mario
4371000	4373000	Odyssey they don't make good
4373000	4375000	games like that anymore
4375000	4377000	honestly
4377000	4379000	if
4379000	4381000	well no cause they'd have to convert
4381000	4383000	the engine so I guess there's no
4383000	4385000	Mass Effect to be had on it
4385000	4387000	what about the original trilogy that could
4387000	4389000	happen you know because there's been tweets
4389000	4391000	out there the N7 day is next
4391000	4393000	week right so and I guess it's the
4393000	4395000	it's 10 years of Mass Effect this year
4395000	4397000	and EA I'm still mad I know
4397000	4399000	well here's my punchline EA put out
4399000	4401000	a tweet that said come join us to celebrate
4401000	4403000	10 years of Mass Effect on November 7
4403000	4405000	so what if they show another
4405000	4407000	trailer for Anthem that day
4407000	4409000	I am gonna riot
4409000	4411000	my reply was
4411000	4413000	if it's not Cory and Arc DLC which we know
4413000	4415000	it's not cause they're putting it on a book
4415000	4417000	or a remaster of the trilogy
4417000	4419000	go party by yourself which is my nice way
4419000	4421000	of saying go fuck yourself
4421000	4423000	after what you did to that franchise
4423000	4425000	so if you're not gonna invest like
4425000	4427000	at least if you're gonna say
4427000	4429000	Andromeda done fucked it all up
4429000	4431000	if you're not gonna at least then go back and do
4431000	4433000	the trilogy and remaster that
4433000	4435000	and put that out you know which
4435000	4437000	could hypothetically be on the Switch
4437000	4439000	then you know what
4439000	4441000	that's a party I ain't going to
4443000	4445000	have fun
4445000	4447000	anyhow let's move on to happier news
4447000	4449000	Dark Sakura what do you have for us
4449000	4451000	well
4451000	4453000	you know I love my Animal Crossing
4453000	4455000	and I'm looking forward to Animal Crossing Pocket Camp
4455000	4457000	even though I am not going to
4457000	4459000	you know be an idiot and make an
4459000	4461000	Australian account just to play it early
4461000	4463000	when I'm going to have it
4463000	4465000	soon anyway
4465000	4467000	but anyway
4467000	4469000	of course it's already
4469000	4471000	been data mined for information
4471000	4473000	put up by CriticalGG
4473000	4475000	and
4475000	4477000	there are
4477000	4479000	I mean it's interesting but not surprising
4479000	4481000	so as a
4481000	4483000	campsite manager you will be able to grow your
4483000	4485000	own plants in the garden
4485000	4487000	and you have to water them
4487000	4489000	I mean that's just mainstays
4489000	4491000	of Animal Crossing
4491000	4493000	really
4493000	4495000	but then you also like buy fertilizer
4495000	4497000	which if I remember correctly came
4497000	4499000	up in New Leaf
4499000	4501000	and then you have
4501000	4503000	soil states normal to dry
4503000	4505000	to withered
4505000	4507000	your other
4507000	4509000	animals can hang out in your gardens
4509000	4511000	and then there's like plant breeding which again
4511000	4513000	they also had with the different you know
4513000	4515000	colors of roses and other
4515000	4517000	plants in New Leaf
4517000	4519000	and then you also
4519000	4521000	are going to have like winter themed locations
4521000	4523000	different things for different seasons
4523000	4525000	different facilities
4525000	4527000	like a school, a shop, a hospital
4527000	4529000	restaurant, office and hotel
4529000	4531000	and that's like more of the stuff from
4531000	4533000	New Leaf so this is really
4533000	4535000	just like it seems to me
4535000	4537000	just like normal
4537000	4539000	Animal Crossing but
4539000	4541000	updated for
4541000	4543000	mobile
4543000	4545000	and of course it doesn't necessarily mean that these
4545000	4547000	items are going to be
4547000	4549000	implemented in the game
4549000	4551000	but the thing that's interesting is that there's costumes
4551000	4553000	that are found which again there were costumes
4553000	4555000	in New Leaf and other Animal
4555000	4557000	Crossing games but it includes Mario
4557000	4559000	Link and Samus
4559000	4561000	so you can get those
4561000	4563000	assets already existed in the other Animal Crossing
4563000	4565000	games I just think it's cool that
4565000	4567000	this is really going to look like it's more
4567000	4569000	like an actual Animal
4569000	4571000	Crossing so I'm pretty happy
4571000	4573000	I got to admit
4573000	4575000	like I don't know what it is I don't know if it's just because
4575000	4577000	Animal Crossing has not
4577000	4579000	been about collecting virtual console
4579000	4581000	games since the original GameCube release
4581000	4583000	but I'm having a hard time getting
4583000	4585000	excited about it I mean
4585000	4587000	of course I'm going to download it because
4587000	4589000	it's free and of course I'm going to try it
4589000	4591000	and play it and who knows maybe I'll have a good time
4591000	4593000	but like when I watched the
4593000	4595000	Nintendo Direct at the end of it I was just
4595000	4597000	kind of meh
4597000	4599000	oh yeah
4599000	4601000	how about something really
4601000	4603000	truly different for Animal Crossing I mean
4603000	4605000	granted they're going to save that for the Switch
4605000	4607000	probably, hopefully, but I just
4607000	4609000	I wasn't that excited
4609000	4611000	I don't know
4611000	4613000	I'm going to play it and I want one for Switch
4613000	4615000	I love my Animal Crossing
4615000	4617000	that's cool
4617000	4619000	with my Switch I can take it to work
4619000	4621000	and play it during my lunch
4621000	4623000	SSJ100Matt says in chat
4623000	4625000	my girlfriend is all over this Animal Crossing mobile game
4625000	4627000	which means I will have to be but I'm like Rob
4627000	4629000	I'm not really feeling it after watching the Direct
4629000	4631000	Kaijuto though says Animal Crossing
4631000	4633000	is fun times and JD saying
4633000	4635000	I'm looking forward to the Animal Crossing game
4635000	4637000	it's like the Funko dolls
4637000	4639000	I'm not going to knock you for spending money on
4639000	4641000	Animal Crossing have fun with it
4641000	4643000	I like Animal Crossing
4643000	4645000	but for me it's a little
4645000	4647000	stale so maybe
4647000	4649000	the change in setting or maybe some of this other
4649000	4651000	stuff maybe it will make the mobile version
4651000	4653000	more interesting but I'm just
4653000	4655000	I'm not really excited about it
4655000	4657000	although I did have a laugh
4657000	4659000	at the whole Tom Nook on the Cash Money Store
4659000	4661000	because there was a picture
4661000	4663000	like there's pictures of Tom Nook
4663000	4665000	selling the different amounts and the highest
4665000	4667000	amount of like the paper tickets you can buy
4667000	4669000	is like 50 bucks and it shows
4669000	4671000	a picture of Tom Nook swimming in a
4671000	4673000	bathtub full of money and that
4673000	4675000	cracked me up so at least I was like
4675000	4677000	well at least there's a sense of humor about
4677000	4679000	what a disgusting amount of money Nintendo
4679000	4681000	stands to make off this game
4681000	4683000	I like that his icon is one you can have
4683000	4685000	on your Switch
4685000	4687000	oh yeah that's right it is huh
4687000	4689000	I have a little version of my Mii
4689000	4691000	I think doing a little pose
4691000	4693000	that's like hey
4693000	4695000	I want to try my amiibos on it
4695000	4697000	now all my Animal Crossing ones and see if
4697000	4699000	any of them bring anything up
4699000	4701000	in certain games
4701000	4703000	I'm talking about on the actual system
4703000	4705000	where you can use it to make your avatar
4705000	4707000	I don't think the system will do no the system won't do anything
4707000	4709000	but the games will like you can use
4709000	4711000	any amiibo in Breath of the Wild
4711000	4713000	only Zelda related ones do
4713000	4715000	very specific things but the other
4715000	4717000	amiibos will give you coins, random items
4717000	4719000	and Mario Odyssey is a very
4719000	4721000	similar thing like every amiibo
4721000	4723000	will give you something but only certain
4723000	4725000	ones like Bridal Peach will give you
4725000	4727000	something like very specific I wonder if the
4727000	4729000	Tom Nook one will take your money
4729000	4731000	it might or if the Resetti one will actually
4731000	4733000	yell at you that would be
4733000	4735000	cool alright
4735000	4737000	let's move on with some more stories
4737000	4739000	Loki another big event this past weekend
4739000	4741000	right yes I forgot that BlizzCon was even
4741000	4743000	this weekend but apparently there is
4743000	4745000	lots of announcements from that oh you don't
4745000	4747000	follow the same people I do on Twitter I
4747000	4749000	couldn't avoid it but it's
4749000	4751000	you know what I had a lot of fun when I went in
4751000	4753000	2014 I would love I was
4753000	4755000	a little pissy that Diablo
4755000	4757000	was nowhere to be found and
4757000	4759000	they said it was gonna really not be
4759000	4761000	a BlizzCon I was a little pissy about that but
4761000	4763000	you know I was still
4763000	4765000	I was still living vicariously for my friends
4765000	4767000	who were there it's really about the community
4767000	4769000	at these meetups so
4769000	4771000	they did announce that their
4771000	4773000	Overwatch is getting another hero
4773000	4775000	so they have Moira
4775000	4777000	and or Moira
4777000	4779000	I guess Moira
4779000	4781000	Moira I believe is correct
4781000	4783000	okay she is
4783000	4785000	a healer and
4785000	4787000	I guess from
4787000	4789000	of course Blackwatch
4789000	4791000	and then they also
4791000	4793000	showed off a new
4793000	4795000	map as well which is kind of neat
4795000	4797000	it's like Blizzard World which I guess
4797000	4799000	is a tribute to different Blizzard games
4799000	4801000	it's like Disneyland
4801000	4803000	it's that China theme park that
4803000	4805000	ripped it all off that was when I was first looking
4805000	4807000	I was like oh they got the last laugh on that
4807000	4809000	didn't they remember the stories about the China
4809000	4811000	theme park that they built around World of Warcraft
4811000	4813000	and shit like that's what it is
4813000	4815000	so I had a good laugh about
4815000	4817000	that I'll just quickly say
4817000	4819000	with the Moira thing too
4819000	4821000	she was completely unexpected because they
4821000	4823000	haven't really dropped any hints about who the character
4823000	4825000	would be so
4825000	4827000	Moira kind of came out of nowhere
4827000	4829000	so to speak but they also showed
4829000	4831000	during one of the development panels which I thought was really interesting
4831000	4833000	they showed a ton
4833000	4835000	of concept art for like all
4835000	4837000	these different characters
4837000	4839000	yeah I thought there was a jet pack cat or something
4839000	4841000	there was an
4841000	4843000	it's an illusion to an old
4843000	4845000	kung fu movie but there was an old
4845000	4847000	Asian lady with curlers in her hair smoking
4847000	4849000	a cigarette oh yeah from kung fu
4849000	4851000	hustle is that yeah there was a character
4851000	4853000	in Overwatch that looked like that old lady
4853000	4855000	that was awesome
4855000	4857000	that would have been fucking rad
4857000	4859000	jet pack cat in there
4859000	4861000	yeah jet pack cat would be awesome but who knows
4861000	4863000	maybe some of these characters will come out
4863000	4865000	in the future who knows
4865000	4867000	especially if they get good feedback on it because remember the whole
4867000	4869000	Pandarian thing remember that was a big old
4869000	4871000	April Fools joke thing and then all of a sudden
4871000	4873000	that's true
4873000	4875000	this expansion you know because people were fans of it
4875000	4877000	that's true
4877000	4879000	so that was kind of neat and then
4879000	4881000	in non-Overwatch news of course
4881000	4883000	this was something that they've
4883000	4885000	alluded to in the past with shutting down
4885000	4887000	those servers but
4887000	4889000	World of Warcraft classic is finally
4889000	4891000	announced which is going to be basically
4891000	4893000	the vanilla World of Warcraft
4893000	4895000	before you know they added
4895000	4897000	all the expansions ugh all those people are welcome
4897000	4899000	to that shit go
4899000	4901000	have fun everybody
4901000	4903000	I don't miss having to elementally
4903000	4905000	do my weapons
4905000	4907000	or training with my weapon
4907000	4909000	I don't miss that shit
4909000	4911000	they can have it I know everybody that's like
4911000	4913000	back in the day World of Warcraft actually
4913000	4915000	used to be hard you know when they first
4915000	4917000	announced the news I was like why the fuck did
4917000	4919000	Blizzard give in to those people why did they give them those
4919000	4921000	people they're going to do all this work
4921000	4923000	building those servers then people are going to be like
4923000	4925000	oh yeah this game sucks
4925000	4927000	what's it's fuck outside Orgrimmar
4927000	4929000	were it was like
4929000	4931000	they divided it into two areas now
4931000	4933000	I've come around on my
4933000	4935000	perspective if that's
4935000	4937000	go build the classic zone
4937000	4939000	get those fucking people out
4939000	4941000	of the game all those people that are like
4941000	4943000	back in my day fine go
4943000	4945000	be here go have fun go have fun
4945000	4947000	in your playground that is not
4947000	4949000	going to be as good as you remember
4949000	4951000	have a blast going to level 40 to get your
4951000	4953000	mount have a great time
4953000	4955000	maybe I'll come back to wow who knows
4955000	4957000	but I wasn't really feeling
4957000	4959000	the rest of the news that they announced Loki
4959000	4961000	yeah so um
4961000	4963000	yeah along with that of course
4963000	4965000	they did announce that if you are
4965000	4967000	you know like most people that do
4967000	4969000	enjoy the expansions they have another
4969000	4971000	expansion coming so they have
4971000	4973000	a horde versus alliance expansion
4973000	4975000	called the battle for
4975000	4977000	Azeroth which has a new
4977000	4979000	continent uh Zandalar
4979000	4981000	and new dungeon raids
4981000	4983000	and uncharted
4983000	4985000	islands and
4985000	4987000	I guess um you also have
4987000	4989000	uh you know basically
4989000	4991000	um supporting
4991000	4993000	the you know different alliances
4993000	4995000	in this alliance versus horde war
4995000	4997000	how long
4997000	4999000	have people been talking about having
4999000	5001000	the Zandalar stuff like
5001000	5003000	since vanilla at least
5003000	5005000	Lich King when that was really front and center
5005000	5007000	in one particular zone there right
5007000	5009000	so why are they announcing
5009000	5011000	this shit after I've decided to move on
5011000	5013000	that's why they're doing it but I
5013000	5015000	gotta say my I was not
5015000	5017000	I didn't
5017000	5019000	again I was kind of meh at the expansion
5019000	5021000	news I wasn't really feeling it like when they were talking
5021000	5023000	this whole line about we're going back to
5023000	5025000	the war in Warcraft and going back to our roots
5025000	5027000	I'm like you say the same thing every
5027000	5029000	expansion when you introduce
5029000	5031000	Mists of Pandaria you said
5031000	5033000	we're going back to horde versus alliance
5033000	5035000	and we all saw how that turned out
5035000	5037000	so forgive
5037000	5039000	me if I give a little side eye to this whole
5039000	5041000	we're going back to our roots uh huh
5041000	5043000	sure Jan honestly I'm
5043000	5045000	tired of the whole horde versus alliance thing
5045000	5047000	I would rather like have
5047000	5049000	a neutral faction
5049000	5051000	horde an alliance fuck party is that
5051000	5053000	something you'd play it'll be called
5053000	5055000	the whoreliance
5055000	5057000	and then
5057000	5059000	finally last but not least they
5059000	5061000	said that Starcraft 2 is going free to play
5061000	5063000	so you can actually
5063000	5065000	on November 14th it will download
5065000	5067000	Wings of Liberty
5067000	5069000	the campaign without paying anything
5069000	5071000	and you get access to both single and
5071000	5073000	multiplayer for free
5073000	5075000	that's a pretty big deal for a lot of
5075000	5077000	people that Starcraft will be free but it
5077000	5079000	sounds like it's free but
5079000	5081000	it sounds kinda limited
5081000	5083000	it sounds like you have to buy the expansions if you want
5083000	5085000	those they're just not selling the base game anymore and then
5085000	5087000	apparently if you just have Wings of Liberty
5087000	5089000	they'll also give you the first expansion
5089000	5091000	that's me I only have
5091000	5093000	Wings of Liberty but never really play the game after that
5093000	5095000	so you'll get that at least
5095000	5097000	so that's cool I guess if you want to
5097000	5099000	try it out and of course they have the
5099000	5101000	Starcraft
5101000	5103000	remaster that you can check that out too so
5103000	5105000	that's also free
5105000	5107000	you did miss the news for the current Blizzard game I'm all
5107000	5109000	about which is Heroes of the Storm
5109000	5111000	oh yeah so they have more Overwatch characters
5111000	5113000	coming to it? Just one Hanzo
5113000	5115000	which is like the worst Overwatch
5115000	5117000	character I'm sorry but people are gonna disagree
5117000	5119000	with me on that but
5119000	5121000	actually he makes
5121000	5123000	as much as I kinda give him shit in Overwatch
5123000	5125000	he makes a lot of sense for Heroes of the Storm
5125000	5127000	like his abilities especially the dragon
5127000	5129000	thing for a lane game are gonna be great
5129000	5131000	so alright whatever and then Alex
5131000	5133000	Straza looks pretty cool I guess but you know
5133000	5135000	here's the thing with
5135000	5137000	all that Blizzard kind of announces
5137000	5139000	new heroes throughout the year all
5139000	5141000	the time like we just got
5141000	5143000	within the past six weeks
5143000	5145000	Ana and Junkrat from Overwatch
5145000	5147000	so the whole reveal
5147000	5149000	of Hanzo and Alex Straza
5149000	5151000	at Blizzcon didn't feel
5151000	5153000	exactly like oooh
5153000	5155000	you know so it's like oh okay this is
5155000	5157000	the next months and they're just doing it on stage at
5157000	5159000	Blizzcon so oh
5159000	5161000	and there's another game Hearthstone
5161000	5163000	they have a new expansion too
5163000	5165000	something about the Hoggers and a silly
5165000	5167000	little theme song that goes with it because there's always
5167000	5169000	some silly little theme song that goes with it
5169000	5171000	so but I don't play a lot of Hearthstone
5171000	5173000	sorry guys but I know some people are super into that
5173000	5175000	so your requisite
5175000	5177000	Blizzcon announcement of a Hearthstone
5177000	5179000	expansion did indeed occur done
5179000	5181000	alright
5181000	5183000	going to chat
5183000	5185000	over at live.vognetwork.com
5185000	5187000	SHO100Matt says wow Hanzo
5187000	5189000	shade you know what
5189000	5191000	let's see Ragenator says if Hanzo was in a valley
5191000	5193000	would he be Hanzo low
5193000	5195000	and shoot first?
5195000	5197000	oh god
5203000	5205000	yes he would
5205000	5207000	no no no because
5207000	5209000	I quit I'm done with this show
5209000	5211000	I quit here's my letter of resignation
5211000	5213000	no no no no Han didn't shoot first
5213000	5215000	Han shot only
5217000	5219000	alright
5219000	5221000	but Han's taking medication to fix that
5221000	5223000	problem so
5223000	5225000	moving on just for that
5225000	5227000	next story oh it's my story god dammit
5227000	5229000	alright
5229000	5231000	just for that we're doing sad
5231000	5233000	news first off for sad news
5233000	5235000	and actually I don't mean to make light of this because
5235000	5237000	this news really does suck runic
5237000	5239000	games has been closed if you don't know them
5239000	5241000	by name you probably know the games they made
5241000	5243000	does EA own them? no
5243000	5245000	actually perfect world owns runic
5245000	5247000	games does EA own them? no
5247000	5249000	torchlight and torchlight 2
5249000	5251000	were the big games that runic made which
5251000	5253000	coming off this news of no diablo
5253000	5255000	news we've seen these other games that
5255000	5257000	kind of come in and you know pick up the slack
5257000	5259000	what was it Grim Dawn's another one that's
5259000	5261000	pretty good I mean that's not runic but you know there's
5261000	5263000	other like diablo clones out there
5263000	5265000	oh path of exiles the other
5265000	5267000	huge one right but anyway sadly
5267000	5269000	torchlight which was pretty good I
5269000	5271000	really enjoyed it runic games has been
5271000	5273000	closed that fucking sucks
5273000	5275000	they also were making a MOBA
5275000	5277000	called gigantic but
5277000	5279000	sadly they have closed
5279000	5281000	runic games which was located in
5281000	5283000	Seattle perfect world
5283000	5285000	in a statement said that that gigantic
5285000	5287000	will quote continue to be available on all
5287000	5289000	our platforms and runic will
5289000	5291000	remain a part of perfect world entertainment's portfolio
5291000	5293000	of studios
5293000	5295000	they also went to say for those
5295000	5297000	that love the torchlight series
5297000	5299000	there will be some news coming that's from
5299000	5301000	runic studio head Marsh Leffler
5301000	5303000	and for all our fans our
5303000	5305000	community and multiplayer services will keep running
5305000	5307000	even after the studio's lights go off
5307000	5309000	you haven't heard the last of us
5309000	5311000	so it makes me think that another developer
5311000	5313000	will be taking the reins for torchlight 3
5313000	5315000	or whatever is next in torchlight's
5315000	5317000	future but sadly a moment
5317000	5319000	of silence for our pals at runic games
5319000	5321000	that's not fun news to talk about
5323000	5325000	also not fun to talk about is
5325000	5327000	house mark apparently says
5327000	5329000	they're no longer going to make arcade games
5329000	5331000	and that means like arcade style games
5331000	5333000	this was in a blog
5333000	5335000	from CEO Larry
5335000	5337000	Quintonen sorry
5337000	5339000	I'm totally mispronouncing that but in this open
5339000	5341000	letter said despite critical success
5341000	5343000	and numerous awards our games just
5343000	5345000	haven't sold in significant numbers
5345000	5347000	are they the ones that did super stardust or something?
5347000	5349000	they are the ones that did super stardust as
5349000	5351000	well as rezogun which were huge
5351000	5353000	titles here's the thing
5353000	5355000	I was like wait a minute didn't house mark
5355000	5357000	have a game that I really wanted to play coming out
5357000	5359000	they did it's next
5359000	5361000	Mashina was the other
5361000	5363000	game that they were doing
5363000	5365000	and actually did you
5365000	5367000	know that next Mashina came out
5367000	5369000	that was that game they showed at E3 that was
5369000	5371000	the big trailer they had with it
5371000	5373000	and Eugene Jarvis was a part
5373000	5375000	of this game which is a pretty big deal he was
5375000	5377000	back in the day was he Robotron
5377000	5379000	Defender, Defender was the game that Eugene
5379000	5381000	Jarvis did so
5381000	5383000	it was a big deal that he was partnering up
5383000	5385000	that game came out over the summer
5385000	5387000	I had no
5387000	5389000	idea and I wanted to play that game
5389000	5391000	so
5391000	5393000	I need to go back on my Playstation 4 and
5393000	5395000	get it but can I just say that
5395000	5397000	like you know now granted look
5397000	5399000	this podcast thing is a
5399000	5401000	hobby Twitter isn't everything
5401000	5403000	although it's a lot but I'm just saying like
5403000	5405000	I really liked what I saw at E3
5405000	5407000	I had no
5407000	5409000	idea this game came out already
5409000	5411000	I think
5411000	5413000	that should say something about why the game wasn't selling
5413000	5415000	did
5415000	5417000	you guys know that it came out because
5417000	5419000	I missed it it's also to the Sony
5419000	5421000	storefront that they have their Playstation
5421000	5423000	stores kind of crap I would
5423000	5425000	I would agree with that it's time for it to evolve
5425000	5427000	it needs an evolution it needs a fresh coat of
5427000	5429000	paint I'll give you that
5429000	5431000	because there will be games that I know
5431000	5433000	like are coming out like for example there was
5433000	5435000	that Megaton Rainfall game
5435000	5437000	that I was looking forward to
5437000	5439000	and it was supposed to come out on a certain day
5439000	5441000	and it was like only a couple days away from it and it wasn't on the storefront
5441000	5443000	anywhere I was like okay well shit you know I was
5443000	5445000	gonna market for download or pre-purchase or something
5445000	5447000	like that and it wasn't there and all of a sudden like
5447000	5449000	oh yeah it's up now and it's like
5449000	5451000	okay well there's the store page but like
5451000	5453000	all these other games have like coming soon pages
5453000	5455000	and everything where's all this shit
5455000	5457000	well now and I do want to clarify Housemark
5457000	5459000	hasn't announced that they're closing they're just
5459000	5461000	announcing that they're making different games
5461000	5463000	now so that's fine I mean well that's
5463000	5465000	fine if a company wants to branch out and do different games but
5465000	5467000	honestly the shocking part
5467000	5469000	of that story honest to god for me and maybe
5469000	5471000	I was just in the dark or playing something else
5471000	5473000	the most shocking part of that story was that that game came out
5473000	5475000	and I had no idea
5477000	5479000	oops I guess I'm part of the problem
5479000	5481000	Kaijuto said it was
5481000	5483000	all over the PSVR store page it was a
5483000	5485000	PSVR game?
5485000	5487000	I had no idea
5487000	5489000	it was a VR game?
5489000	5491000	I didn't know that
5491000	5493000	I figured since they kept talking about
5493000	5495000	Robotron and name checking Eugene Jarvis
5495000	5497000	I figured it was kind of like a modern version of Robotron
5497000	5499000	with some awesome Tron
5499000	5501000	looking music and stages and stuff
5501000	5503000	that's and I was here for that so
5503000	5505000	I had no idea it was a VR game
5505000	5507000	oh boy
5507000	5509000	alright well good luck to Housemark
5509000	5511000	with their future development and
5511000	5513000	promotion of the things that they put out
5513000	5515000	that's for sure so
5515000	5517000	anyway and Dark Tetsuya confirming
5517000	5519000	yeah it is oh I mean it's like
5519000	5521000	Robotron alright well Dark Tetsuya
5521000	5523000	Dark Tetsuya figured out that that
5523000	5525000	game came out I somehow missed that
5525000	5527000	sorry about that oops I killed
5527000	5529000	that franchise sorry guys
5529000	5531000	Dark Sakura what do you have for us?
5531000	5533000	treasure
5533000	5535000	buried treasure? no my favorite
5535000	5537000	no treasure like Radiant Silver Gun
5537000	5539000	and Ikaruga well that's pretty cool too
5539000	5541000	Gunstar Heroes
5541000	5543000	so there was a rumor
5543000	5545000	that treasure was going to stop making new
5545000	5547000	games but
5547000	5549000	no
5549000	5551000	the last new game that they
5551000	5553000	did was Geist Crusher God that came out in
5553000	5555000	2014
5555000	5557000	anyway
5557000	5559000	the rumor was that
5559000	5561000	they were going to go as an IP holding company
5561000	5563000	but their president
5563000	5565000	Mayagawa Masato said
5565000	5567000	that they have an announcement
5567000	5569000	coming out in 2018 and
5569000	5571000	that treasure is not going to make social
5571000	5573000	games as long as he lives
5573000	5575000	the quote I'll never work on
5575000	5577000	social games for as long as I live
5577000	5579000	I'll have something to share next
5579000	5581000	year somebody's taking
5581000	5583000	a stand somebody has had it officially
5583000	5585000	right?
5585000	5587000	but anyway he also
5587000	5589000	was complaining
5589000	5591000	about the lack of communication
5591000	5593000	at Sega when they were working
5593000	5595000	on Mega Drive games especially when they were working
5595000	5597000	on Yu Yu Hakusho and
5597000	5599000	they said Gunstar Heroes shipped
5599000	5601000	70,000 units in Japan and
5601000	5603000	200,000 abroad and that the
5603000	5605000	the
5605000	5607000	first run of it in
5607000	5609000	Japan ran out really quickly he also wishes
5609000	5611000	that Sega would do a
5611000	5613000	Mega Drive mini like what Nintendo
5613000	5615000	is doing and not licensed out by a third
5615000	5617000	party so that it actually is the right
5617000	5619000	you know
5619000	5621000	hardware to run the games
5621000	5623000	so
5623000	5625000	anyway
5625000	5627000	we've got some things
5627000	5629000	here from Treasure from next year that's going to be pretty
5629000	5631000	exciting I love Treasure
5631000	5633000	would you like a Dreamcast mini
5633000	5635000	or like a... Dude a Dreamcast
5635000	5637000	mini would be rad
5637000	5639000	of course how
5639000	5641000	many you know
5641000	5643000	burned GD-ROMs
5643000	5645000	do we have
5645000	5647000	in existence?
5647000	5649000	how many times how many of us
5649000	5651000	own
5651000	5653000	have a copy of
5653000	5655000	Mario Brothers or Super Mario Brothers
5655000	5657000	and ROMs and stuff everybody does but it doesn't mean
5657000	5659000	they're not going to buy the system
5659000	5661000	I'd buy a Dreamcast mini
5661000	5663000	oh hell yeah I'd buy a Dreamcast mini
5663000	5665000	especially if they put PSO
5665000	5667000	again on it you know I don't know
5667000	5669000	how that would work but I would be here for that
5669000	5671000	who cares this is fantasy world that we're talking
5671000	5673000	fantasy zone
5673000	5675000	I don't think it's in our
5675000	5677000	show role at all but PSO2
5677000	5679000	is getting like some neat skins
5679000	5681000	like I tend to leave
5681000	5683000	that stuff out because it just causes me pain
5683000	5685000	well I mean there's
5685000	5687000	but like they're supposed to be getting
5687000	5689000	um
5689000	5691000	oh god what was it like
5691000	5693000	one of the Shining games
5693000	5695000	skins for that
5695000	5697000	and uh virtual on
5697000	5699000	so that may be enough
5699000	5701000	to make me re-download it
5701000	5703000	alright just a few more stories
5703000	5705000	before we get to the classic system of the month
5705000	5707000	but first Loki
5707000	5709000	yes so Call of Duty World War 2
5709000	5711000	finally came out and
5711000	5713000	there's of course
5713000	5715000	controversy
5715000	5717000	uh well first off
5717000	5719000	you know they have the controversy that
5719000	5721000	for some stupid reason
5721000	5723000	they have Trevor T. Martin
5723000	5725000	actually
5725000	5727000	promoting the game
5727000	5729000	and he was best known
5729000	5731000	for violating
5731000	5733000	Federal Trade Commission regulations
5733000	5735000	by owning a
5735000	5737000	Counter Strike skin gambling
5737000	5739000	site and not
5739000	5741000	disclosing that so
5741000	5743000	he's apparently doing I guess
5743000	5745000	a race of prestige
5745000	5747000	fundraiser type thing
5747000	5749000	I don't know I think it's
5749000	5751000	dumb but all the more reason
5751000	5753000	not to really give a shit about this
5753000	5755000	um one of the big things
5755000	5757000	though that's kind of annoying though and remember
5757000	5759000	we talked about this whole
5759000	5761000	um patent that
5761000	5763000	Activision had done
5763000	5765000	and they said no we're not using this patent
5765000	5767000	in Destiny 2 or whatever about
5767000	5769000	loot boxes and basically
5769000	5771000	finding ways to get people you know
5771000	5773000	oh exposed to loot boxes
5773000	5775000	and you know manipulating people
5775000	5777000	in certain ways guess what
5777000	5779000	Call of Duty World War 2 has
5779000	5781000	it's not in Destiny
5781000	5783000	it's not in Destiny but guess what it has
5783000	5785000	it has fucking loot boxes
5785000	5787000	because I know when people are in
5787000	5789000	World War 2 loot boxes fell from the
5789000	5791000	fucking heavens and you know
5791000	5793000	there's literally like achievements
5793000	5795000	and goals in the game to watch people because
5795000	5797000	when people get there's like a social area
5797000	5799000	first off so the beach of Normandy is a
5799000	5801000	social area so many things are wrong
5801000	5803000	with that in the first place wow
5803000	5805000	so wow there's that
5805000	5807000	and then apparently as
5807000	5809000	you're doing that when you get loot boxes
5809000	5811000	other players can see them drop from
5811000	5813000	the sky and see what cool shit you
5813000	5815000	got as like some sort of
5815000	5817000	subliminal way to say oh maybe you should
5817000	5819000	purchase some fucking loot boxes
5819000	5821000	like a certain patent that a certain company
5821000	5823000	made that said oh don't worry
5823000	5825000	it's not evil we're just thinking
5825000	5827000	about ideas except we're totally gonna do this
5827000	5829000	in the next Call of Duty what you're describing
5829000	5831000	is like a parody
5831000	5833000	of what gaming has become
5833000	5835000	but it's fucking real
5835000	5837000	yes so
5837000	5839000	on top the social zone
5839000	5841000	of the beach of Normandy
5843000	5845000	yes so yeah
5845000	5847000	they have these socializations
5847000	5849000	what other cool things do they have in
5849000	5851000	there as well well apparently
5851000	5853000	you can also
5853000	5855000	uhhhh
5855000	5857000	play Pitfall
5857000	5859000	well I do like Pitfall
5859000	5861000	who doesn't like Pitfall but yes you can play
5861000	5863000	Pitfall 2 even
5863000	5865000	better I love Pitfall 2 I think you actually
5865000	5867000	have to purchase some of these so
5867000	5869000	yeah they have a rest and relaxation thing
5869000	5871000	so they have
5871000	5873000	it's a fucking loot box isn't it you have to purchase
5873000	5875000	them with in game money or whatever
5875000	5877000	but they've got and I don't know
5877000	5879000	if it's per play
5879000	5881000	but apparently you can go to
5881000	5883000	an R&R tent and they have Pitfall 2
5883000	5885000	Grand Prix, Fishing Derby
5885000	5887000	Enduro, Kaboom
5887000	5889000	River Raid
5889000	5891000	okay so all the old 2600 Activision
5891000	5893000	yes all the old Activision
5893000	5895000	games which is all on those
5895000	5897000	Flashback consoles because Flashbacks
5897000	5899000	are on version 8 this year
5899000	5901000	and the big thing that they got was
5901000	5903000	Activision licenses so like all those
5903000	5905000	exact same games you just named are on those
5905000	5907000	Flashback 8 consoles
5907000	5909000	yeah just except
5909000	5911000	I don't think Pitfall 2 is in it but Pitfall 1
5911000	5913000	is
5913000	5915000	so it's just
5915000	5917000	something that they have in this part of this hub
5917000	5919000	now
5919000	5921000	alrighty
5921000	5923000	to register participation for this
5923000	5925000	week's episode of Orange Island Radio at
5925000	5927000	vognetwork.com use the passphrase
5927000	5929000	home
5929000	5931000	so yeah well look I'm all for
5931000	5933000	classic games being available and all this stuff
5933000	5935000	but if they charge you per play
5935000	5937000	that's a little silly I don't think
5937000	5939000	I don't think they're charging probably per play
5939000	5941000	doesn't specifically state that that would be
5941000	5943000	kind of lame because who would do that
5943000	5945000	but they're like you know it
5945000	5947000	doesn't look like it's that much currency it's like
5947000	5949000	10 currency or something like that
5949000	5951000	10 whatever loot
5951000	5953000	I don't know what the fuck they're
5953000	5955000	10 lootie points
5955000	5957000	10 looties
5957000	5959000	are
5959000	5961000	you found the lootie
5961000	5963000	alright and one more story
5963000	5965000	for you before we get to the classic game of the week
5965000	5967000	and it's about the video game
5967000	5969000	Just Dance have you played Just Dance
5969000	5971000	recently? no not for several
5971000	5973000	years it's a
5973000	5975000	a franchise I've kind of fallen out of
5975000	5977000	taking the world by storm
5977000	5979000	well apparently it is I mean they still
5979000	5981000	they're still putting them out
5981000	5983000	Just Dance 2018 is out there
5983000	5985000	yeah because they don't have to update their
5985000	5987000	engine or anything they spit them out
5987000	5989000	every year because they still have it coming out on the original Wii
5989000	5991000	so apparently
5991000	5993000	these games are so popular that
5993000	5995000	it's justifying the existence of
5995000	5997000	Just Dance Live
5997000	5999000	that's right
5999000	6001000	4 places in North America
6001000	6003000	if you are one of the lucky residents of
6003000	6005000	Miami, Chicago
6005000	6007000	Houston or Los Angeles
6007000	6009000	guess what Just Dance Live
6009000	6011000	is coming to your town
6011000	6013000	what is Just Dance Live?
6013000	6015000	I don't fucking know because I can't
6015000	6017000	figure it out from the trailer it looks like
6017000	6019000	it's just a kid friendly
6019000	6021000	rave meaning
6021000	6023000	all the glow sticks and none of the ecstasy
6023000	6025000	I think that's what it is
6025000	6027000	um
6027000	6029000	apparently there will be dancers
6029000	6031000	and by the way Just Dance has like
6031000	6033000	degrees as dancers too
6033000	6035000	you can't actually be playing Just Dance without having
6035000	6037000	like a panda bear like a character
6037000	6039000	doing the dances
6039000	6041000	yeah they said there's characters on stage
6041000	6043000	that you follow they're iconic
6043000	6045000	once again Ubisoft misusing
6045000	6047000	the word iconic
6047000	6049000	Just Dance moves
6049000	6051000	girl that panda dance
6051000	6053000	iconic
6053000	6055000	like I'm sure that like you know the
6055000	6057000	iconic moves of like
6057000	6059000	no
6059000	6061000	any of the moves that they do in the game
6061000	6063000	which is iconic I guess
6063000	6065000	colorful characters dancing live on stage
6065000	6067000	you follow along share the thrill
6067000	6069000	with your friends and family
6069000	6071000	pricing from $45
6071000	6073000	to $99
6073000	6075000	for the VIP experience
6075000	6077000	okay to be fair
6077000	6079000	it does sound to me like this is an event
6079000	6081000	for kids like when I say kid friendly
6081000	6083000	rave like there's a half truth
6083000	6085000	to that so
6085000	6087000	Loki this begs the question
6087000	6089000	take your kids to the Just Dance
6089000	6091000	live first off
6091000	6093000	my kids don't know what Just Dance is
6093000	6095000	um so no
6095000	6097000	I would not do that and I was
6097000	6099000	just curious oh my god
6099000	6101000	fucking hell is wrong with these people
6101000	6103000	are you watching the trailer

6137000	6139000	although it's been in many of her music videos
6139000	6141000	Katy Perry is not going to be there
6141000	6143000	at the Just Dance event in fact
6143000	6145000	no actual
6145000	6147000	recording artist that you know from
6147000	6149000	these games except unless there's like an
6149000	6151000	in-house band or something will not
6151000	6153000	be there so you are meeting
6153000	6155000	people
6155000	6157000	that are just dressed up
6157000	6159000	you're meeting costume
6159000	6161000	characters
6161000	6163000	that
6163000	6165000	it's awfully bold of
6165000	6167000	them to assume
6167000	6169000	that this is so big that
6169000	6171000	I
6171000	6173000	I just can't
6173000	6175000	you can't
6175000	6177000	you can't literally
6177000	6179000	let's put this back okay so they have like dancing
6179000	6181000	with the stars and they do live stage
6181000	6183000	performances of that but that you're watching an
6183000	6185000	actual skilled person that like
6185000	6187000	knows how to ballroom dance and that's like
6187000	6189000	that's actually kind of entertaining because you
6189000	6191000	know what C-list celebrities which are
6191000	6193000	you know so you know what you're going
6193000	6195000	into that but this is like
6195000	6197000	it's just people playing
6197000	6199000	the fucking game basically
6199000	6201000	you're watching them and doing the same
6201000	6203000	shit why would I pay
6203000	6205000	$45 to go to an arena
6205000	6207000	to do that
6207000	6209000	even if I was a kid I could think of
6209000	6211000	way better things I'd spend my money on
6211000	6213000	how about a copy of Just Dance
6213000	6215000	come on Noel Gustin our chat
6215000	6217000	over at live.vognetwork.com says
6217000	6219000	Rob if they had an ABBA themed
6219000	6221000	one you'd be there
6221000	6223000	how dare you drag me and
6223000	6225000	read me so accurately in front of our
6225000	6227000	dozens and dozens of listeners how very
6227000	6229000	would you though would you would you seriously
6229000	6231000	go pay they wouldn't be ABBA
6231000	6233000	singing it would just be pre-recorded ABBA music
6233000	6235000	with some dumbasses on stage
6235000	6237000	dancing to it would you pay
6237000	6239000	$45 to watch
6239000	6241000	people dancing to ABBA
6241000	6243000	well see here's the thing here's the thing
6243000	6245000	like I want to say I want
6245000	6247000	to have my pride I want to
6247000	6249000	say no Loki I would not
6249000	6251000	but the reality is
6251000	6253000	I'm pretty sure there actually is a show
6253000	6255000	in Reno where drag queens
6255000	6257000	do ABBA songs but that's drag queens
6257000	6259000	okay that's some talented people this
6259000	6261000	is fucking
6261000	6263000	did our token straight person
6263000	6265000	here on Orange Lounge Radio just
6265000	6267000	say drag queens are more talented
6267000	6269000	than the Just Dance live crew yes because it's
6269000	6271000	fucking this panda bear that I
6271000	6273000	see on my screen I am the
6273000	6275000	proudest gay I am the proudest
6275000	6277000	seriously like there's this the
6277000	6279000	picture that they have of the Just Dance live
6279000	6281000	interactive experience that's
6281000	6283000	quite a bold statement right there
6283000	6285000	you know they have this
6285000	6287000	and sorry
6287000	6289000	for using this word because they use
6289000	6291000	it quite often but sorry fucking
6291000	6293000	retarded looking panda bear it is
6293000	6295000	the most stupid derpy
6295000	6297000	panda bear I have ever seen
6297000	6299000	and don't get me wrong like
6299000	6301000	this would be different if it was like a
6301000	6303000	character that people know but no one's like
6303000	6305000	oh my god I love panda
6305000	6307000	bear from

6361000	6363000	E3s and think back to the Ubisoft
6363000	6365000	conferences okay what is seriously
6365000	6367000	the best part of every Ubisoft title
6367000	6369000	is it I'm surprised
6369000	6371000	you didn't say it's the Just Dance
6371000	6373000	performances because I know every time I see those
6373000	6375000	Just Dance performances on any of those
6375000	6377000	Ubisoft conferences like holy
6377000	6379000	fuck this is stupid and cringy as
6379000	6381000	shit this is what people are paying
6381000	6383000	money to go see why
6383000	6385000	why would you say that
6385000	6387000	well if they say Aisha Tyler's
6387000	6389000	gonna be there now I haven't said I'll
6389000	6391000	tell you what I'm sure that these people
6391000	6393000	that listen to these songs like the artists
6393000	6395000	that sing these songs how about you put that
6395000	6397000	$25 towards a ticket and actually see the real
6397000	6399000	artist go
6399000	6401000	on stage and perform because that's fucking
6401000	6403000	worth spending money on not watching
6403000	6405000	a bunch of nobodies dance to a
6405000	6407000	song that's why you have Just Dance
6407000	6409000	so you can be a bunch of nobodies dancing to
6409000	6411000	a song you don't need to pay money to
6411000	6413000	go to an event to do that calm down
6413000	6415000	Marissa Congusto our
6415000	6417000	our pal we love her in our chat saying
6417000	6419000	dumb asses on stage was rejected
6419000	6421000	by the marketing team
6421000	6423000	alright
6423000	6425000	look we have got to move on
6425000	6427000	but maybe we'll revisit
6427000	6429000	this topic a little later Wink
6429000	6431000	in the meantime we need to get to
6431000	6433000	a segment we do here on the show quite
6433000	6435000	regularly called the classic
6435000	6437000	game of the week except
6437000	6439000	plot twist dark soccer
6439000	6441000	sometimes like it's really a plot
6441000	6443000	11 months and once
6443000	6445000	a month she does the classic system
6445000	6447000	of the month this is the next to last one
6447000	6449000	it is and it's actually not one
6449000	6451000	that wasn't on our original list you
6451000	6453000	changed it I did
6453000	6455000	because this one's pretty fucking awesome
6455000	6457000	alright well that's alright it's your segment you can do whatever the hell
6457000	6459000	you want it's the classic game of the week
6459000	6461000	or this week the classic system of the month
6461000	6463000	as it was known in
6463000	6465000	Japan the
6465000	6467000	X Rokuman Hasen which just sounds
6467000	6469000	so cool this thing allowed
6469000	6471000	the X68000
6471000	6473000	which is a home computer that was made
6473000	6475000	by Sharp it was first released in
6475000	6477000	1987 only in
6477000	6479000	Japan it had
6479000	6481000	first model of 10 megahertz
6481000	6483000	Motorola 68000 CPU
6483000	6485000	one whole meg of ram
6485000	6487000	and no hard drive
6487000	6489000	the last one that came
6489000	6491000	out which was in 1993 had a
6491000	6493000	25 megahertz Motorola
6493000	6495000	68000
6495000	6497000	30 CPU
6497000	6499000	4 meg of ram
6499000	6501000	and an
6501000	6503000	optional 80 megabyte
6503000	6505000	SCSI hard drive it was so SCSI
6505000	6507000	at any rate
6507000	6509000	this was
6509000	6511000	pretty much the thing to have if
6511000	6513000	you liked your Capcom games
6513000	6515000	basically most of the
6515000	6517000	and also you could expand the ram to
6517000	6519000	12 megabytes but it didn't really
6519000	6521000	need more than two for most of the games
6521000	6523000	so anyway it's
6523000	6525000	operating system was called human
6525000	6527000	86000 which was developed
6527000	6529000	by Sharp and
6529000	6531000	actually developed for Sharp by Hudson
6531000	6533000	soft and we know Hudson was
6533000	6535000	actually really big in bed with
6535000	6537000	with
6537000	6539000	NEC at the time
6539000	6541000	oh a lot of questions
6541000	6543000	were just answered this video just got to a segment
6543000	6545000	from Parodius Da
6545000	6547000	which I know is one of your favorites
6547000	6549000	yeah
6549000	6551000	it had really a lot of great games on it
6551000	6553000	it looks really, he said this is
6553000	6555000	93 as he just ended
6555000	6557000	yeah 87 to 93
6557000	6559000	this looks really good for a system of that time
6559000	6561000	well and I picked just basically
6561000	6563000	you know like some of the top 10
6563000	6565000	or top 30 games for my video on it
6565000	6567000	but it also
6567000	6569000	was like a tall tower
6569000	6571000	it was white because
6571000	6573000	apparently I guess light colored
6573000	6575000	systems do well in Japan
6575000	6577000	maybe anyway
6577000	6579000	it also
6579000	6581000	had
6581000	6583000	it would also function as
6583000	6585000	with a cable ready
6585000	6587000	TV set with composite video input
6587000	6589000	it also
6589000	6591000	could
6591000	6593000	the display that came with it I'm sorry
6593000	6595000	would also work for JAMA
6595000	6597000	arcade boards because it had RGB input
6597000	6599000	and a
6599000	6601000	standard resolution refresh timing
6601000	6603000	so pretty good
6603000	6605000	it used
6605000	6607000	a hard disk interface
6607000	6609000	which was the
6609000	6611000	SASI sassy
6611000	6613000	I want to call it
6613000	6615000	that basically
6615000	6617000	the later versions though went with the
6617000	6619000	which was pretty much a standard
6619000	6621000	for a long time and then I guess
6621000	6623000	it got
6623000	6625000	you know replaced by something better
6625000	6627000	it did not support
6627000	6629000	the vfat file name
6629000	6631000	standard that went with windows systems
6631000	6633000	it had an 18.3
6633000	6635000	character file name instead of the 8.3
6635000	6637000	allowed in the fat system
6637000	6639000	so yeah just some
6639000	6641000	background on it but the thing that made this the best
6641000	6643000	the thing that made this the best is
6643000	6645000	because the
6645000	6647000	2000 had very
6647000	6649000	similar hardware
6649000	6651000	to what arcade machines
6651000	6653000	ran at the time and it also
6653000	6655000	was the Capcom CPS
6655000	6657000	system development machine
6657000	6659000	it had different text
6659000	6661000	it could support separate text ram graphic ram
6661000	6663000	and hardware sprites as well
6663000	6665000	it also had Yamaha's
6665000	6667000	basically best synthesizer at the time
6667000	6669000	and it was
6669000	6671000	the thing I mean basically
6671000	6673000	games that were made
6673000	6675000	for this system were
6675000	6677000	Parodius Da as we saw
6677000	6679000	Ghouls and Ghosts, Strider, Final Fight, Alien
6679000	6681000	Syndrome, Street Fighter 2
6681000	6683000	Dash and
6683000	6685000	actually one of the best Castlevania
6685000	6687000	versions the original
6687000	6689000	Akumajo Dracula
6689000	6691000	that was later on ported
6691000	6693000	to Playstation with Castlevania Chronicles
6693000	6695000	Chorensha 68000
6695000	6697000	which basically was
6697000	6699000	ported to Windows later
6699000	6701000	and it
6701000	6703000	really just allowed for
6703000	6705000	beautiful graphics and
6705000	6707000	I mean arcade perfect sound
6707000	6709000	was amazing on it again
6709000	6711000	everything that the system
6711000	6713000	that basically came out on the system
6713000	6715000	was like having an arcade
6715000	6717000	version in your home
6717000	6719000	it really was the one to have
6719000	6721000	I would love to have one if I could find
6721000	6723000	one I mean
6723000	6725000	it'd be fun to hook
6725000	6727000	that up and play different
6727000	6729000	things you know I think it would be
6729000	6731000	the Legend of the Valkyrie we're looking at
6731000	6733000	is it? I missed the name sorry
6733000	6735000	oh well but anyway
6735000	6737000	just to go over
6737000	6739000	a list of a few more of the games that came out
6739000	6741000	on it a couple of little things
6741000	6743000	that people might
6743000	6745000	might recognize is
6745000	6747000	we had After Burner
6747000	6749000	came out on it Alien Syndrome
6749000	6751000	like I said
6751000	6753000	we had
6753000	6755000	Asuka 120% Burning Festival
6755000	6757000	we had Atomic Robo Kid
6757000	6759000	Battle Chess
6759000	6761000	I fucking love Battle Chess by the way
6761000	6763000	a game called Blodia
6763000	6765000	several Bomberman games
6765000	6767000	Bubble Bobble
6767000	6769000	Chase HQ
6769000	6771000	Columns
6771000	6773000	it's a cotton game
6773000	6775000	Cotton Fantastic Night Dreams
6775000	6777000	this system has your name written all over it
6777000	6779000	it's like all your favorite games
6779000	6781000	I'm really surprised you don't have one of these
6781000	6783000	well they're pretty expensive
6783000	6785000	I mean like I said Daimakemura
6785000	6787000	is Ghost and Goblins
6787000	6789000	Daytona Twinbee
6789000	6791000	several Dragon Knight games
6791000	6793000	I'm just going through the list here
6793000	6795000	you don't have to read the whole list
6795000	6797000	Emerald Dragon came out on this
6797000	6799000	Emerald Dragon which I
6799000	6801000	which is kind of like one of the
6801000	6803000	golden games to have for
6803000	6805000	the PC Engine
6805000	6807000	that came out on this
6807000	6809000	we had Final Fight, Fantasy Zone
6809000	6811000	all the stuff that I fucking love
6811000	6813000	Galaga 98
6813000	6815000	and several of the Garo Densetsu
6815000	6817000	games which was Fatal Fury
6817000	6819000	so
6819000	6821000	hey
6821000	6823000	this is the thing to have
6823000	6825000	yeah so if you
6825000	6827000	have one to give away Dark Sakura would like to talk to you
6827000	6829000	honestly
6829000	6831000	even if you could find one just for a good
6831000	6833000	affordable price I'd be down for it
6833000	6835000	I would give someone else's right
6835000	6837000	arm for this
6837000	6839000	alright anything else to say about this?
6839000	6841000	no I know this system looks
6841000	6843000	this is like Dark Sakura's like somebody made
6843000	6845000	this just for you if you actually
6845000	6847000	want to see really good comparisons
6847000	6849000	for how well this ran everything
6849000	6851000	in comparison to its
6851000	6853000	uh
6853000	6855000	what's the word, contemporaries
6855000	6857000	look for
6857000	6859000	oh shit Salamander which was Life Force
6859000	6861000	but look for
6861000	6863000	the channel that does Battle of
6863000	6865000	the Ports and
6865000	6867000	he's really good
6867000	6869000	I mean a lot of them are played emulated but it
6869000	6871000	really does showcase how
6871000	6873000	great this system is compared
6873000	6875000	to its contemporaries that were out at the time
6875000	6877000	especially like the ZX Spectrum
6877000	6879000	I mean that was just kind of sad
6879000	6881000	but it's worth a shot I mean
6881000	6883000	really really really if
6883000	6885000	on my
6885000	6887000	holy grail of systems to have
6887000	6889000	this would be at the top of it followed by
6889000	6891000	the Mardi or the FM Towns
6891000	6893000	Mardi and then
6893000	6895000	probably after that well I'd still really
6895000	6897000	like a duo RX
6897000	6899000	so
6899000	6901000	there it is your classic system of the month
6901000	6903000	the Sharp X68000
6903000	6905000	good pick Dark Sakura
6905000	6907000	I didn't really know a lot about that system
6907000	6909000	but it looks really
6909000	6911000	I mean just looking at the video it's looking
6911000	6913000	like arcade versions it would be
6913000	6915000	just it's on my list
6915000	6917000	I would need you underwear for that system
6917000	6919000	alright we're gonna take
6919000	6921000	a break but when we come back we have plenty more show

7007000	7009000	PlayStation Plus they announced what games are
7009000	7011000	coming out in November I am sorely
7011000	7013000	disappointed because I actually own all these
7013000	7015000	uh at least the VR
7015000	7017000	games um but you get
7017000	7019000	Worms battleground on PlayStation
7019000	7021000	4 I guess I don't have that bound
7021000	7023000	which is an alright
7023000	7025000	PlayStation VR PlayStation
7025000	7027000	4 game uh the one though I do recommend
7027000	7029000	and really there's no reason you shouldn't
7029000	7031000	have this if you have a PlayStation VR
7031000	7033000	but Until Dawn Rush of Blood
7033000	7035000	is free and that's just seriously one of
7035000	7037000	the best games on the on the platform
7037000	7039000	um so definitely check that out
7039000	7041000	that's you it's on
7041000	7043000	Playlink and then of course on
7043000	7045000	PlayStation 3 R-Type Dimensions
7045000	7047000	on PlayStation 3 and Ragdoll
7047000	7049000	Kung Fu Fists of Plastic on
7049000	7051000	PS3 then they have um
7051000	7053000	Fravita Dungeon Punks
7053000	7055000	uh which is also cross platform with
7055000	7057000	PlayStation 4 and Broken Sword 5
7057000	7059000	The Serpent's Curse episode 1 and 2
7059000	7061000	which is on Vita and
7061000	7063000	those should be available shortly
7063000	7065000	um and then of course
7065000	7067000	another thing coming to the PlayStation
7067000	7069000	VR um platform
7069000	7071000	as well sorry I was giving
7071000	7073000	Loki theme music there sorry
7073000	7075000	um is Stranger Things
7075000	7077000	the VR experience now
7077000	7079000	I'm not sure what exactly this is
7079000	7081000	um they kinda showed a little bit
7081000	7083000	of a teaser but it
7083000	7085000	sorta resembles the
7085000	7087000	I don't know if it was a VR experience
7087000	7089000	or like a 360
7089000	7091000	video that I watched for Stranger Things
7091000	7093000	um they had something that was kinda
7093000	7095000	tied in with like the first season of
7095000	7097000	of the show
7097000	7099000	it was in like Will's house and stuff
7099000	7101000	and it was alright
7101000	7103000	if that's the same thing I hope it's
7103000	7105000	more to that because I would like
7105000	7107000	something a little bit more elaborate but
7107000	7109000	I'm thinking it may just be that because
7109000	7111000	that was available on the mobile VR
7111000	7113000	platforms not too long ago
7113000	7115000	but we'll see hopefully it's something
7115000	7117000	more exciting
7117000	7119000	alright well guess what the modders are
7119000	7121000	up to recently they're still playing with
7121000	7123000	Super Mario 64 this time it's not about that
7123000	7125000	multiplayer thing that uh
7125000	7127000	got the uh the other
7127000	7129000	uh Mario thing shut down but this time it looks like
7129000	7131000	somebody's put a portal gun
7131000	7133000	into Super Mario 64
7133000	7135000	this was by modder
7135000	7137000	Kaze Emanuar
7137000	7139000	who did a video called Portal
7139000	7141000	Mario 64 which of course you can download
7141000	7143000	right now before Nintendo shuts it down
7143000	7145000	and you can do the portal mechanic from Portal
7145000	7147000	with Super Mario 64
7147000	7149000	I mean need I say more about that
7149000	7151000	sounds awesome
7151000	7153000	yeah it does sound awesome
7153000	7155000	why not both
7155000	7157000	yes why not both
7157000	7159000	I think we talked about this console
7159000	7161000	not that long ago but it's the super
7161000	7163000	retro bit micro console
7163000	7165000	I think they had a regular version of this that was
7165000	7167000	kind of amped but now they have a new one coming out
7167000	7169000	and it was going to be Capcom and Data East
7169000	7171000	titles like Strider, Final Fight, Joe
7171000	7173000	and Mac well they
7173000	7175000	also kind of teased it with and more
7175000	7177000	to come right well now we figured out
7177000	7179000	what the more is Technos
7179000	7181000	is the next publisher
7181000	7183000	from the classic days that it's
7183000	7185000	going to be contributing to this which means
7185000	7187000	Double Dragon will be coming
7187000	7189000	to this as well as
7189000	7191000	Combat Tribes and Renegade
7191000	7193000	so there it is 60 bucks for the
7193000	7195000	console which I guess is coming out later
7195000	7197000	this year that's kind of neat Dark
7197000	7199000	Sakura what do you have for us
7199000	7201000	well I guess kind of sadness
7201000	7203000	except he's doing it on
7203000	7205000	why didn't it open
7205000	7207000	sorry I just had a slight technical
7207000	7209000	difficulty because it tried to open the
7209000	7211000	RSS version yay
7211000	7213000	anyway the
7213000	7215000	producer of Danganronpa
7215000	7217000	Saito Yuichiro is leaving
7217000	7219000	Spike Chunsoft
7219000	7221000	basically
7221000	7223000	he said as of
7223000	7225000	the end of October he's resigned
7225000	7227000	and
7227000	7229000	they did a Danganronpa
7229000	7231000	surprise farewell party for him
7231000	7233000	and he's going to be doing
7233000	7235000	console games for
7235000	7237000	a different world
7237000	7239000	he said and he's also
7239000	7241000	wearing
7241000	7243000	in this
7243000	7245000	he's wearing Doraemon pajamas because
7245000	7247000	he's also a big Doraemon fan which
7247000	7249000	I think is funny because the
7249000	7251000	original voice actor for
7251000	7253000	Monokuma was also
7253000	7255000	Doraemon back in the day so
7255000	7257000	pretty cool although
7257000	7259000	he or she's not doing very well so very
7259000	7261000	sad and then an easter egg
7261000	7263000	an ass creed sorry
7263000	7265000	assassin's creed
7265000	7267000	because they like the ass
7267000	7269000	is
7269000	7271000	the TARDIS so basically if
7271000	7273000	you're in Letopolis
7273000	7275000	going through ancient
7275000	7277000	Egypt under the
7277000	7279000	water you will see a
7279000	7281000	stone TARDIS it is very
7281000	7283000	clearly the TARDIS as well
7283000	7285000	so the
7285000	7287000	doctor was here
7287000	7289000	and that's it
7289000	7291000	alright let's travel around

7363000	7365000	Occultic 9

7381000	7383000	tanks and war
7383000	7385000	sim type games I think that's kind of in the
7385000	7387000	vein of Nobunaga's ambition
7387000	7389000	let's see if there's anything on the Vita
7389000	7391000	this week yeah that Occultic 9

7415000	7417000	makes its way out to Japan
7417000	7419000	but I don't think we really have
7419000	7421000	any major releases in Japan this week
7421000	7423000	one minor one
7423000	7425000	Cake Yasen Monogatari

7443000	7445000	I want to be the ultimate patissier
7445000	7447000	I want to be the ultimate cake eater

7449000	7451000	next week there's a little game coming out in Japan

7453000	7455000	Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon
7455000	7457000	and I think there'll be a lot of people excited about
7457000	7459000	that on the 3DS
7459000	7461000	alright how about the UK Dark Sakura
7461000	7463000	we have on the 7th

7483000	7485000	just yet
7485000	7487000	every week you guys email us
7487000	7489000	participate at orangelaungeradio.com
7489000	7491000	and Dark Sakura dives in the mail bag
7491000	7493000	head first and finds some emails
7493000	7495000	worth our time reading on the show
7495000	7497000	although with the weeks and weeks
7497000	7499000	and weeks of no show
7499000	7501000	I'm sure we've been flooded with emails
7501000	7503000	one
7503000	7505000	stinkin' email let's get to it
7505000	7507000	hello LR
7507000	7509000	hi YYR you're the only one who starts it that way
7509000	7511000	after the
7511000	7513000	continued discussion last week on
7513000	7515000	free-to-play style monetizations
7515000	7517000	and loot boxes being present in AAA games
7517000	7519000	nowadays
7519000	7521000	and about the potential reasons why I felt
7521000	7523000	a need to chime in because something about
7523000	7525000	this seems a bit familiar to me
7525000	7527000	throughout my life I've spent a lot of time
7527000	7529000	in arcades but I started talking to
7529000	7531000	owners and operators when I was in college
7531000	7533000	back then in 1999
7533000	7535000	I remember the operator
7535000	7537000	of an Aladdin's castle asking me
7537000	7539000	what do you think the biggest earning
7539000	7541000	game in this place is? Tekken Tag Tournament
7541000	7543000	was hugely popular upon its
7543000	7545000	release I was
7545000	7547000	one of probably at least a dozen players
7547000	7549000	who played it every weekend
7549000	7551000	so that was my guess but that wasn't the
7551000	7553000	answer I was shocked when
7553000	7555000	this man said to me it's that coin pusher
7555000	7557000	over there
7557000	7559000	just a few years ago I owned a DJMax Technica
7559000	7561000	cabinet and made a deal with the owner
7561000	7563000	of an arcade in Queens to host it there
7563000	7565000	and split the revenues I love
7565000	7567000	the fact that he also had several other
7567000	7569000	fantastic hardcore games such as
7569000	7571000	DDRX2
7571000	7573000	the latest
7573000	7575000	Beatmania 2DX and Popin' Music
7575000	7577000	plus an Initial D, Maximum Tune
7577000	7579000	Tekken 6 and others being conveyed
7579000	7581000	to me a sad truth the loyal crowd of
7581000	7583000	hardcore players the ones that kept coming
7583000	7585000	back to play these games over and over again
7585000	7587000	were not nearly enough to keep his doors open
7587000	7589000	the casual players that fed his ticket
7589000	7591000	redemption and prized games were a far greater
7591000	7593000	source of income
7593000	7595000	backing up this theory even
7595000	7597000	further is the story of
7597000	7599000	Nanowet Arcade
7599000	7601000	which opened in Fall 2014
7601000	7603000	and was filled to the brim with over 50 arcade games
7603000	7605000	spanning all eras and genre
7605000	7607000	plus a number of pinball tables
7607000	7609000	but absolutely no ticket redemption at all
7609000	7611000	when I visited it felt like someone's dream
7611000	7613000	arcade but with no redemption I wondered about its
7613000	7615000	long term viability as it turned out
7615000	7617000	it closed forever just a few days before its first
7617000	7619000	birthday so what does this
7619000	7621000	have to do with loot boxes and console games
7621000	7623000	here it is think back
7623000	7625000	to a generation or two every time
7625000	7627000	a movie came out there were console
7627000	7629000	and handheld games to match
7629000	7631000	you had games for kids
7631000	7633000	games based on Disney properties
7633000	7635000	games for casuals games for families
7635000	7637000	this is all because you had
7637000	7639000	millions upon millions of casual
7639000	7641000	console gamers where are they now
7641000	7643000	the answer is simple poking away at
7643000	7645000	phones and tablets
7645000	7647000	according to a statistics site
7647000	7649000	around 69 million of the most popular game
7649000	7651000	consoles and handhelds were sold worldwide
7651000	7653000	in 2011 by 2016
7653000	7655000	this figure shrank to around 27 million
7655000	7657000	that's a drop of more than 50%
7657000	7659000	the same sites claim that within the
7659000	7661000	US overall dollar sales of consoles
7661000	7663000	and handheld video games dropped about
7663000	7665000	50% between 2009 and 2015
7665000	7667000	with spending on social media
7667000	7669000	based and mobile games more than doubling
7669000	7671000	over that same period
7671000	7673000	over the last few years our hardware has progressed
7673000	7675000	AAA games look better than ever
7675000	7677000	budgets have fattened
7677000	7679000	development team sizes have increased and even
7679000	7681000	worse market competition has exploded
7681000	7683000	and yet the casual audience who used to
7683000	7685000	generate half the revenue has all but
7685000	7687000	vanished from the arcade of the modern gaming market
7687000	7689000	how can the hardcore
7689000	7691000	keep the doors open
7691000	7693000	since we don't have real
7693000	7695000	redemption games we substitute the next best thing
7695000	7697000	loot boxes quite honestly
7697000	7699000	I think we're seeing the beginning of a huge
7699000	7701000	market shake up one that we'll see the
7701000	7703000	larger game developers and publishers needing to
7703000	7705000	make massive changes just to keep their doors open
7705000	7707000	except for Nintendo because they're Nintendo
7707000	7709000	I guess we'll see keeping the
7709000	7711000	discussion going
7739000	7741000	at home started getting better and better
7741000	7743000	right when we were talking about the classic system of the week
7743000	7745000	of the month this week we talked you were
7745000	7747000	mentioning that the games looked as
7747000	7749000	good as they did in the arcades and that was the early
7749000	7751000	90s that was kind of the beginning of the
7751000	7753000	end which is why we don't have things like Flynn's
7753000	7755000	arcade anymore because
7755000	7757000	you can get a lot of those similar experiences
7757000	7759000	at home but that also kind
7759000	7761000	of goes I think for the arcades to kind of do
7761000	7763000	a soul searching a little bit you know what
7763000	7765000	does seem to be doing well in arcades right now
7765000	7767000	well shit it's kind of come full circle
7767000	7769000	they're stealing a lot of the ideas from
7769000	7771000	mobile these loyalty cards
7771000	7773000	that unlock new characters or new cards
7773000	7775000	or new songs in Bimani games
7775000	7777000	through EMUs or you know the similar
7777000	7779000	stuff in
7779000	7781000	Square Enix's theater
7781000	7783000	in those types of games you know that's
7783000	7785000	I see a lot of that stuff kind of selling at
7785000	7787000	round one so it is kind of interesting
7787000	7789000	how a lot of that stuff does seem to be coming full circle
7789000	7791000	in a way but round one is also
7791000	7793000	I mean for all the fucking import games
7793000	7795000	we talk about and how it feels great
7795000	7797000	to be in an arcade that really feels like the arcades
7797000	7799000	that we used to go to in our twenties like
7799000	7801000	round one is also well
7801000	7803000	over half redemption games
7803000	7805000	there's so many
7805000	7807000	freaking crane games well and on top of that
7807000	7809000	too you know I think that
7811000	7813000	the arcades that are
7813000	7815000	really the ones that are thriving
7815000	7817000	are the ones that have the right balance
7817000	7819000	between the redemption like
7819000	7821000	remember when we went to round one
7821000	7823000	I think half the time was spent
7823000	7825000	on the Bimani and the other half was
7825000	7827000	spent on those claws not me
7827000	7829000	that's you that was me well okay
7829000	7831000	that was me you're the claw addict but
7831000	7833000	you know I love those things and I got a
7833000	7835000	really crappy looking no
7835000	7837000	I got the blooper and I got a Yoshi
7837000	7839000	you can spend your money on whatever the fuck you
7839000	7841000	like but I think that it's also
7841000	7843000	I think the concept that the
7843000	7845000	average person who
7845000	7847000	people like to get something
7847000	7849000	that's another thought that I have about it
7849000	7851000	people like to have
7851000	7853000	either some kind of tangible
7853000	7855000	or quantifiable result
7855000	7857000	for the time that they've spent doing
7857000	7859000	something it's not just the joy
7859000	7861000	of playing anymore
7861000	7863000	they want something for it people have this
7863000	7865000	competitive nature and
7865000	7867000	they want to see something for their efforts
7867000	7869000	as Joe and her map points out
7869000	7871000	bark aid seem to be doing well
7871000	7873000	that's true all you have to clean up just
7873000	7875000	add booze you know every city's
7875000	7877000	got one of these at this point
7877000	7879000	but that's that strikes to me
7879000	7881000	more as like games aren't the
7881000	7883000	feature at these places I'm sorry to say
7883000	7885000	games are the niche
7885000	7887000	for the bar some bars
7887000	7889000	have music certain types of music
7889000	7891000	some bars have really
7891000	7893000	lush seating or food
7893000	7895000	some bars have arcade machines
7895000	7897000	those are the best ones yeah
7897000	7899000	those are the ones we like but maybe
7899000	7901000	there's some people that like to go to this other bar
7901000	7903000	because they do sports
7903000	7905000	uh every single
7905000	7907000	Sacramento Kings game is on all the time at this
7907000	7909000	bar you know maybe that's another
7909000	7911000	niche who knows anyway
7911000	7913000	so uh
7913000	7915000	alright well thank you for the email yyr
7915000	7917000	it is it is an interesting perspective I don't know
7917000	7919000	if I would directly relate redemption
7919000	7921000	games to loot boxes but I do
7921000	7923000	see where you're going and I do kind of think
7923000	7925000	the industry is a bit of a
7925000	7927000	a circle in that regard so there is
7927000	7929000	that it's like gambling I guess so
7929000	7931000	it's similar to
7931000	7933000	kind of the whole
7933000	7935000	coin pusher games and stuff I mean
7935000	7937000	because that's really what the loot boxes are you're
7937000	7939000	gambling to see if you're going to get more
7939000	7941000	out of that than you put into it
7941000	7943000	and I guess even with the redemption stuff
7943000	7945000	on top of that you're kind of earning tickets
7945000	7947000	to purchase
7947000	7949000	something that you want which of course all
7949000	7951000	the things that they have in the redemption case
7951000	7953000	are worth like nothing so
7953000	7955000	unless of course it's Dave and Busters
7955000	7957000	when I worked at an Aladdin's castle
7957000	7959000	I would save all the little
7959000	7961000	tickets that kids would leave in the machines
7961000	7963000	and I would put them in I had this
7963000	7965000	secret pouch in my purse and I
7965000	7967000	turned them in before I left and
7967000	7969000	got a polaroid camera
7969000	7971000	and several Tekken 3
7971000	7973000	shirts that were like
7973000	7975000	only the ones they gave at the Namco arcades
7975000	7977000	so you can get some good stuff
7977000	7979000	if you take your time
7979000	7981000	alright you know
7981000	7983000	you guys have been very well behaved
7983000	7985000	and we feel bad for missing last week's
7985000	7987000	show so you know what I think tonight
7987000	7989000	we need to bring back a segment that we haven't
7989000	7991000	done in a very long time and that
7991000	7993000	segment is listless
7993000	7995000	but I do have one small change
7995000	7997000	you see the old theme song we used
7997000	7999000	to use for listless that now gets
7999000	8001000	our episodes flagged on YouTube for copyright
8001000	8003000	infringement so I'm going to have to change the
8003000	8005000	song that we use so I'm very sorry to Crystal Waters
8005000	8007000	but blame your music label
8007000	8009000	people for content IDing at the drop
8009000	8011000	of a hat so I accidentally let
8011000	8013000	this sneak out a little bit earlier but I thought a new
8013000	8015000	theme we could use for listless is
8015000	8019000	listless, listless, listless, listless, listless
8019000	8021000	should this one get us flagged either?
8021000	8023000	what?
8023000	8025000	should this one get us flagged either?
8025000	8027000	eh it might but it would be worth it
8027000	8029000	ok
8029000	8031000	so here we go
8031000	8033000	tonight's list I'm sure you're all dying
8033000	8035000	to know the topic since we haven't done this in forever
8035000	8037000	well since we had that news
8037000	8039000	story about Just Dance
8039000	8041000	becoming a live experience
8041000	8043000	to which Loki at quite
8043000	8045000	some length discussed here on the show
8045000	8047000	we thought well then if that's the case
8047000	8049000	which video game
8049000	8051000	should become a live
8051000	8053000	experience so tonight
8053000	8055000	we will be building the definitive list
8055000	8057000	here which video game
8057000	8059000	needs a live
8059000	8061000	experience alright so
8061000	8063000	you can participate with us over at
8063000	8065000	live.vognetwork.com and
8065000	8067000	god I haven't done this segment in forever so I hope
8067000	8069000	the list works right
8069000	8071000	but you should see the question pop
8071000	8073000	up there on the page as well
8073000	8075000	as our four contestants tonight so we
8075000	8077000	haven't done listless in a while so this is how it works
8077000	8079000	ok by the way it's not list
8079000	8081000	list it's listless
8081000	8083000	Elliot it's a little play on words but anyway
8083000	8085000	so with listless
8085000	8087000	what's gonna happen is that we're gonna
8087000	8089000	put together the definitive list it's a very
8089000	8091000	scientific process there's no argument
8091000	8093000	so each host and a special guest
8093000	8095000	will bring a list of three to
8095000	8097000	the table and then one by one we're
8097000	8099000	gonna go around and determine which item
8099000	8101000	is not worthy of the list
8101000	8103000	so we'll take a list of twelve items and bring it down to a list
8103000	8105000	of eight items at which point you
8105000	8107000	guys will vote in our chat you're gonna click on
8107000	8109000	your number one and your two answers in that order
8109000	8111000	submit them in over at live.vognetwork.com
8111000	8113000	and we will build the definitive list
8113000	8115000	to which there is no arguing
8115000	8117000	it's done and of course
8117000	8119000	you know we should talk about you know the whole
8119000	8121000	elimination part of that as well
8121000	8123000	oh yeah the whole twist where
8123000	8125000	we made it so that if a host has
8125000	8127000	two answers eliminated from their list
8127000	8129000	the third gets immunity and cannot be eliminated
8129000	8131000	cause unfortunately we had some issues
8131000	8133000	in the past where somebody's
8133000	8135000	list just totally got eliminated
8135000	8137000	and that was sad so
8137000	8139000	anyway joining us tonight a very
8139000	8141000	special guest who you hear sometimes on the show

8204000	8206000	there in our chat room so let's get to it
8206000	8208000	let's start building
8208000	8210000	the list Alan we're gonna
8210000	8212000	let our guests go first tonight what is your number
8212000	8214000	three answer for which video game needs
8214000	8216000	to be a live experience showering
8216000	8218000	with your dad
8221000	8223000	shower with your dad
8223000	8225000	simulator I
8225000	8227000	believe it's the name of the game
8227000	8229000	and why did you pick this
8229000	8231000	because it's fucking funny
8231000	8233000	alright
8233000	8235000	there it is it has been added to the list
8235000	8237000	Dark Sakura
8237000	8239000	what is gonna be your number three pick
8239000	8241000	I was thinking in terms of games
8241000	8243000	so I think Farmville
8243000	8245000	Farmville real life where you get just
8245000	8247000	like regular casual people who've
8247000	8249000	never been to a farm and they have to
8249000	8251000	fucking farm
8252000	8254000	so Farmville is your answer
8254000	8256000	essentially is the game that needs to be
8256000	8258000	Farmville IRL ok Farmville IRL
8258000	8260000	and you said Farmville
8260000	8262000	well it's almost in a way
8262000	8264000	it sounds like kind of like a sick dystopian
8264000	8266000	future where like there are no more
8266000	8268000	it's like being Zsa Zsa Gabor
8269000	8271000	in Green Acres I was trying
8271000	8273000	to go with like that futuristic like
8273000	8275000	sad approach no I'm thinking Zsa Zsa Gabor
8275000	8277000	who has no concept of what to do on a fucking farm
8277000	8279000	ok what
8279000	8281000	was it Zsa Zsa or Ava it was Ava
8281000	8283000	ok one of them
8283000	8285000	it was a Gabor
8285000	8287000	alright my number
8287000	8289000	three answer what item am I
8289000	8291000	gonna pick for my number three answer
8291000	8293000	I decided that the experience that needed
8293000	8295000	a live event was civilization
8295000	8297000	yes
8297000	8299000	civilization would be a live event and you
8299000	8301000	can actually rule the world
8301000	8303000	and uh
8303000	8305000	and nuke Gandhi right back
8305000	8307000	there you go civilization it's on the list
8307000	8309000	Loki your number three answer
8309000	8311000	for what video game needs a live experience
8311000	8313000	um I see
8313000	8315000	like the problem I have with like the Just Dance
8315000	8317000	one was there's really no point to it because
8317000	8319000	you're basically going to watch
8319000	8321000	people dressed up like artists
8321000	8323000	that's you know perform
8323000	8325000	songs but they aren't the artists that perform
8325000	8327000	the songs and they're not really performing the songs
8327000	8329000	dancing so an actual
8329000	8331000	game that would be like performing music
8331000	8333000	that I thought was pretty awesome is DJ Heroes
8333000	8335000	so I would totally see a live
8335000	8337000	performance of DJ Heroes
8337000	8339000	stuff with actual DJs
8339000	8341000	mashing songs together
8341000	8343000	so basically Activision's
8343000	8345000	E3 press conference from that year
8345000	8347000	like touring the country
8347000	8349000	kinda
8349000	8351000	but you have like Daft Punk
8351000	8353000	and you know Dead
8353000	8355000	Mouse and stuff like that I mean it'd be pretty awesome
8355000	8357000	no I get it that would be awesome that would be awesome
8357000	8359000	alright some answers well I'll get to
8359000	8361000	the answers before the last answer we'll get to
8361000	8363000	our answers from chat but uh let's see
8363000	8365000	maybe some of us will steal them and put them on the list
8365000	8367000	for now the number two answer
8367000	8369000	from Allen
8369000	8371000	Hotline Miami
8371000	8373000	Hotline Miami
8373000	8375000	and why are you picking Hotline Miami
8375000	8377000	cause that is the dystopian
8377000	8379000	future listen to this awesome music
8379000	8381000	you're gonna fucking die
8381000	8383000	oh shotgun to the face you're dead
8383000	8385000	are you actually killing people
8385000	8387000	at the Hotline Miami live experience
8387000	8389000	no it would be like the um
8389000	8391000	one of those the Universal
8391000	8393000	Studios things that's like super
8393000	8395000	realistic where it's
8395000	8397000	like don't pay $50
8397000	8399000	to have us jump at you and then punch us in the fucking face
8399000	8401000	or don't go in if you have a heart condition one of those
8401000	8403000	okay like the scare
8403000	8405000	events or some Fright Night
8405000	8407000	something like that alright
8407000	8409000	Hotline Miami you're at
8409000	8411000	did I marry you for real your answers are kinda
8411000	8413000	disturbing
8413000	8415000	the number two answer
8415000	8417000	is Hotline Miami
8417000	8419000	Dark Soccer your number two answer
8419000	8421000	I was going to say
8421000	8423000	actually something along the lines of
8423000	8425000	Call of Duty where it's
8425000	8427000	basically either like a laser tag or paintball
8427000	8429000	but they set up like
8429000	8431000	recreations of like maps
8431000	8433000	and then you pay to get in and play the maps
8433000	8435000	they actually have that but you know do they really
8435000	8437000	they do they did it for uh one of
8437000	8439000	the Call of Duty's yeah they actually set up a map
8439000	8441000	and they did it was Airsoft
8441000	8443000	but does it tour
8443000	8445000	no there you go
8445000	8447000	so
8447000	8449000	what am I calling this Call of Duty
8449000	8451000	IRL
8451000	8453000	just like your Farm Bill
8453000	8455000	which I need to add Farm Bill IRL
8455000	8457000	Call of Duty in real life
8457000	8459000	I would hope most of this would be IRL
8459000	8461000	alright Dark Tetsuya says
8461000	8463000	that would be kinda cool so you have at least
8463000	8465000	one paying customer there you go
8465000	8467000	alright my number two answer is
8467000	8469000	just make Blizzard World
8469000	8471000	real just
8471000	8473000	everybody lost their shit
8473000	8475000	at that press conference
8475000	8477000	when Blizzard showed that as
8477000	8479000	the new Overwatch map so my answer is
8479000	8481000	just make Blizzard World real just
8481000	8483000	if you build it they will come just do it
8483000	8485000	but not in China do it
8485000	8487000	here no offense to China but
8487000	8489000	we need one
8489000	8491000	here for the US income
8491000	8493000	and all that good stuff or at least our
8493000	8495000	friends in Canada alright just build

8503000	8505000	oh that's a good answer why did you
8505000	8507000	say Splatoon because it's just like paintball
8507000	8509000	except you're shooting on the walls and everything
8509000	8511000	and it would be really messy and I
8511000	8513000	at least see people playing that people like
8513000	8515000	doing was it like the Tough Mudder stuff
8515000	8517000	where they covered in mud so what about paint
8517000	8519000	Splatoon 5k
8519000	8521000	or you could do like
8521000	8523000	the Splatfest or something like that
8523000	8525000	no

8571000	8573000	episode 3 area
8573000	8575000	and they would have a Half-Life 3 area and they would have a
8575000	8577000	Left 4 Dead 3 area and this would be the only place
8577000	8579000	you could actually ever play these games
8579000	8581000	yeah and they would have three
8581000	8583000	Gabe Newell's you give them

8605000	8607000	Sims The Tour
8607000	8609000	where basically
8609000	8611000	you have to be in

8621000	8623000	I really need to use the bathroom
8623000	8625000	if they don't let you pee then you have to pee your pants
8625000	8627000	that's not fun and wear really horrible clothing
8627000	8629000	and you can only speak Simlish
8629000	8631000	me me me wah bweeb wah boo boo
8631000	8633000	and
8633000	8635000	Katy Perry's there doing a concert in
8635000	8637000	Simlish because she had that
8637000	8639000	song that was in Simlish which was ridiculous
8639000	8641000	but it was funny
8641000	8643000	we're almost there to the end of the list

8665000	8667000	know this game if it wasn't for Orange
8667000	8669000	Lounge Radio but at one time
8669000	8671000	it was so noteworthy it was our classic game

8777000	8779000	Dead or Alive Extreme Beach Volleyball
8781000	8783000	Cause
8783000	8785000	of all the obvious reasons

8797000	8799000	Here is the list as it stands
8799000	8801000	Shower with your dad
8801000	8803000	Simulator, Hotline Miami
8803000	8805000	Valve presents the number three live
8805000	8807000	Farmville IRL, Call of Duty IRL
8807000	8809000	Sims The Tour, Civilization
8809000	8811000	Just Make Blizzard World Real

8815000	8817000	Extreme Beach Volleyball
8817000	8819000	Now it's tough but it's
8819000	8821000	part of the process
8821000	8823000	Alan, you gotta go first. Which of these
8823000	8825000	is not worthy of the list?
8827000	8829000	I don't wanna be mean
8829000	8831000	and get rid of anyone's
8831000	8833000	I feel that
8833000	8835000	God dammit
8837000	8839000	Can I do one of my own?
8841000	8843000	I don't know if we've ever had that happen before
8843000	8845000	Can a host take one of their own off the list?
8845000	8847000	Alright, why not? Sure
8847000	8849000	Yes, a host can take their own item off the list
8849000	8851000	Half Life or the Valve 3 thing
8851000	8853000	Dammit, that's what I was gonna pick
8853000	8855000	Alright, why are we eliminating
8855000	8857000	Valve the number three?
8857000	8859000	Cause it's not a game, it was just me making fun of Valve
8859000	8861000	I was gonna say cause you could go there
8861000	8863000	and there'd be nothing there cause they
8863000	8865000	don't produce the number three of anything
8865000	8867000	Alright, so in an OLR
8867000	8869000	first, Alan has taken
8869000	8871000	his own item off the list
8871000	8873000	Valve presents the number three
8873000	8875000	is stricken from the list
8875000	8877000	Dark Sakura
8877000	8879000	Which of these is not worthy of the list?
8879000	8881000	Sorry Alan, I'm taking off shower with your dad
8881000	8883000	Ah, shower with your dad
8883000	8885000	simulator. Poor
8885000	8887000	Alan. First, well of course he did it to
8887000	8889000	himself, so there it is
8889000	8891000	That's right, Hotline Miami
8891000	8893000	The Hotline Miami was pretty rad
8893000	8895000	Now has immunity, but shower with your dad
8895000	8897000	has been stricken from the list
8897000	8899000	Ooh, my turn, what am I gonna eliminate from the list?
8899000	8901000	Um
8901000	8903000	These are, like
8903000	8905000	yeah, this is a pretty good roundup of answers
8905000	8907000	Um
8907000	8909000	I'm gonna, I'm gonna
8909000	8911000	Sorry Jamie, I'm gonna take one of yours
8911000	8913000	I'm doing Farm Bill
8913000	8915000	Just because, like, I think you and I
8915000	8917000	have a different vision of what that would be
8917000	8919000	and I wasn't jealous
8919000	8921000	I just think it would be hilarious
8921000	8923000	to have, like, regular people have to actually do a farm
8923000	8925000	Eh, fair enough
8925000	8927000	But unfortunately, I've already clicked the button
8927000	8929000	It's gone, so, sorry Jamie
8929000	8931000	Alright, Loki, last but not least
8931000	8933000	the last one, which of these is not worthy
8933000	8935000	of the list?
8935000	8937000	Um, I'm just gonna have to take Miss Nude World
8937000	8939000	96 off there
8939000	8941000	Oh, you bastard! Oh, why would you
8941000	8943000	eliminate Miss Nude World?
8943000	8945000	I mean, it's old, it's just
8945000	8947000	Oh, I see, you're afraid
8947000	8949000	that now it's about
8949000	8951000	Although, I think that folks
8951000	8953000	in their 50s can be just as fabulous
8953000	8955000	that maybe, maybe
8955000	8957000	we, you know, these folks that were in their
8957000	8959000	prime at one point, or maybe
8959000	8961000	maybe they shouldn't be touring
8961000	8963000	It's just, it's gonna be weird with demons
8963000	8965000	and, like, and just, like

8971000	8973000	Oh, the mic, sorry
8973000	8975000	Yeah, I mean, superficially
8975000	8977000	it's naked ladies, but if you've actually
8977000	8979000	played Miss Nude World, if any
8979000	8981000	college kids tried to go to that high
8981000	8983000	Mm-mm, no, like what

9122740	9124120	this
9124120	9124540	satisfied
9125000	9132040	dual they have stereo speakers in the front and for her mod lithium ion
9132040	9139560	battery so it looks alright I mean considering what phones go for nowadays
9139560	9144520	you know that price range is actually not so bad so that's on on Verizon
9144520	9150120	because that's what I have but who says I'm gonna stick with Verizon so there's
9150120	9156640	a gaming phone and 120 FPS you know what that would be really good for and I
9156640	9163080	don't know if it supports it though VR VR content but is there any is this phone
9163080	9167760	compatible with any of the VR platforms that are on Android I would be very
9167760	9172520	interested to find out because if it is and hell yes I'm on board
9172520	9176560	Brad from pop culture says the razor phone looks kind of cool
9176560	9181920	corky says 120 Hertz isn't a new thing in portable devices the iPad Pro has one
9181920	9186480	so but you know those iPad pros are probably a little more expensive than
9186480	9192480	this device so yeah 700 for a phone mean look at the Samsung Galaxy s8 and the
9192480	9199160	node 8 and I mean that 700 is not that ridiculous as far as phone prices go
9199160	9203520	yeah it's actually kind of a little bit on the lower end all right
9203520	9207240	raising your wants to know will the phone play Miss nude world 96 yes
9207240	9216120	probably would I think of a 486 PC can play this new world 96 to be fair all
9216120	9222240	right let's talk about Niantic the company behind Pokemon go and ingress
9222240	9226000	which you know we don't know what else they're working on but we do know they
9226000	9231280	have acquired a company named Evertune that's right Evertune was acquired by
9231280	9236040	Niantic this week and John Hanke the CEO of Niantic announced this Evertune
9236040	9239720	is a recently established mobile animation app and they're doing this to
9239720	9245540	expand the social media functionality of the games Evertune was founded in 2016
9245540	9250480	and the startup raised 1.7 million today from a variety of publishers for their
9250480	9255700	film sharing app for social networks like YouTube or Twitter so one could
9255700	9259480	imagine that maybe there will be something where Pokemon are animated or
9259480	9262520	something in a later version of Pokemon go but really this could be anything
9262520	9267460	Pokemon animated emojis it could be something for a future game Niantic is
9267460	9272000	planning that we just don't know yet ingress animated emojis who knows who
9272000	9274960	knows you know speaking of this whole like Pokemon go and all this stuff I
9274960	9278000	didn't get into this during my gaming week but did you know there's a knock
9278000	9283600	off game in the App Store and usually usually knock off no game all right
9283600	9287480	tell me there's Garfield game on there at some point too but here's the thing
9287480	9292880	so the latest knockoff game is called Draconius go which is like dragons and
9292880	9299480	stuff and they don't have the same like logical layout of gyms and stuff like
9299480	9304160	Pokemon go has when you first look at the game you'd be like this game is a
9304160	9309920	complete flippin ripoff of Pokemon go and like because it looks like imagine
9309920	9313600	what Pokemon go looked like in February before they announced gen 2 before they
9313600	9318400	did the gyms this is what Draconius go kind of looks like at first glance like
9318400	9321700	it's all the same stuff to look there's a little dragon thingy I don't think I
9321700	9325520	have this one yet on the house so I'm gonna capture that yes Alan with the
9325520	9328720	exception of the critters it really looks like they downloaded the AP get
9328720	9334320	AP gay ha APK and like just unzipped it with like a dash tar well it's all
9334320	9338120	unity so they could just reverse engineer so when we say it's a knock
9338120	9343280	off it it really has a lot of the actual original layout gooey and everything is
9343280	9348000	all but here's the reason why I bring it up so yes at first glance when you
9348000	9350920	play it for the first five minutes right this is a complete fucking ripoff of
9350920	9356640	Pokemon go but then you start to see they added more there's PvP in it
9356640	9361160	there's different types of ways to retrain your monsters in it there's like
9361160	9364960	these other features the Pokemon go doesn't have and you know what Niantic
9364960	9368360	is pissed and I think they're going after this developer for infringement
9368360	9372360	basically but it also kind of goes to show like hey these guys have added
9372360	9375320	these features to the game that you guys have been kind of sitting on for
9375320	9377920	months so it's just interesting I'm not saying if it's right or wrong or
9377920	9380700	anything but it's just an interesting development well they don't own the
9380700	9386080	copyright to that type of gameplay granted it looks very similar but change
9386080	9389940	up that that's fine a lawsuit that you come up with that just change the way
9389940	9396520	your game looks enough and you know put it as your own thing I mean I don't know
9396520	9399480	there's a lot of games to come out that are that people think are knockoffs
9399480	9402920	everything like remember everything is they oh it's a street fire clone or oh
9402920	9405960	that's you know just a clone of this game that's a minecraft clone and then
9405960	9411800	it all becomes its own thing now I want to catch this creature because I don't
9411800	9415000	have one yet there's the one of the creatures is called a potty and that
9415000	9419320	made me laugh because it's an actual little fire pot oh I was thinking it was
9419320	9422320	a potty and I know but that's well I laughed because the name it does make
9422320	9425200	you think of that anyway there you go so I don't want to give this game too much
9425200	9428680	credit but I thought it was interesting that they've kind of taken the template
9428680	9432920	for Pokemon go and added a ton of shit to it and I'm sure Niantic ain't happy
9432920	9436800	about it so there you go who fucking who add some fucking features to it and maybe
9436800	9441280	fix some of the hacking problems yeah little little competition may help who
9441280	9445720	knows we'll see all right let's move on we have some more news Stark Sakura well
9445720	9449680	I'm still super excited about Dragon Ball fighter Z even though the story
9449680	9453960	mode is gonna be fucking bizarre basically you're playing quantum leap
9454000	9459520	you are showing up in the bodies of these different Dragon Ball characters
9459520	9466680	let's try to go through the story and you've got this other artificial human
9466680	9473080	who is talking about eating you like like legit food like she says that
9473080	9477800	everyone's tasty but like at the the start of the trailer it's like you wake
9477800	9483000	up and you're in Goku's body and it's really bizarre so I don't know it's
9483000	9487320	gonna be fun the trailer looks really neat though it's such a pretty game I'm
9487320	9494400	so excited and honestly enough it it is rendered in game but it looks like real
9494400	9499760	animation and that's what I'm super impressed by so super excited it needs to
9499760	9504440	oh and it's gonna be of course out I think January 2018 yeah yeah I was
9504440	9508000	about to say how long is the wait for this game because sorry January 26th
9508200	9515800	okay that's not too bad yeah it's not bad excitement don't kill spiders die
9515800	9519080	have to it was trying to it was looking at me catch it and take it outside
9519080	9524080	sizing me up to eat me up just take it I got one out of my bed and took it
9524080	9530840	outside it was a cute little wolf spider Rob gross they eat mosquitoes yeah
9530840	9535800	anyway let's go to a couple more stories for you guys we're gonna open up the
9535800	9538680	skype line briefly we're running a little long time so we can't take too
9538680	9544000	many calls we'll open up the skype line briefly but first Loki all right so this
9544000	9547720	is a game that I've you know been interested to see a localization forward
9547720	9554680	they've never done it so captain rainbow has a fan translation for the game
9554680	9560080	because it was originally only released in Japan and that's kind of where it
9560080	9564240	ended there but you can actually check it out now so they have it's a patch
9564240	9571320	made by a guy goes by mark ass that's right and he basically combines the
9571320	9577920	works of his translation group kirameki along with his stuff as well so now
9577920	9583180	it's almost 100% complete but there's still a few things missing but it should
9583180	9586760	be enough to at least play the game nice that's kind of cool enough to get you
9586760	9591240	through all right this is the last chance to submit listless votes it will
9591240	9594440	be closing shortly so if you have not submitted your listless votes tonight
9594440	9597920	make sure you get to live dot vog network comm and get those votes in last
9597920	9602960	call meanwhile one more story for you guys tonight and that is that something's
9602960	9606880	going on with Konami because they're acting kind of shitty to their composer
9606880	9611800	teams that create the music in Bamani games obviously things like beat mania
9611800	9616480	DDR and even the newer stuff like music and you know sound voltix and stuff
9616480	9620460	would be nothing if it wasn't for the actual music in the games but what's
9620460	9624580	interesting about it is that now these songs in the game are being attributed
9624580	9630220	to Bamani sound team that's right so we don't see you know the actual creator of
9630220	9635940	the songs anymore it's just attributed to Bamani sound team so yeah some folks
9635940	9640140	are theorizing that this could go back to a dispute about how there's a record
9640140	9643820	label called beat nation records that came out about a decade ago and this has
9643820	9649380	led to live concerts and soundtrack CDs and so on and Konami may actually be a
9649380	9654180	little bit afraid of this so they want to control their artists very well hmm I
9654180	9657620	don't know it sounds like a very BuzzFeed thing to do well and it's it's
9657620	9662260	just kind of just add that to the list of grievances we have with Konami and
9662260	9667220	ask Atari how well that went back in the 2600 days with not crediting your
9667220	9671980	creators and what happened is the cause of that the answer is we got Activision
9671980	9678460	which made better games for Atari's own platform mm-hmm so anyway uh there you
9678460	9682660	go I don't know if you guys have anything to say about that but just I'm
9682660	9687580	not surprised considering the source yeah add add this to the list of Konami
9687580	9693340	grievances shall we all right before we get those bastards before we get to the
9693340	9697100	skype line which we are about ready to open up dark soccer has requested that
9697100	9699640	we bring back another segment we haven't done in a while and it's something we
9699640	9704100	can do on demand but it's CF use of the week
9708460	9710460	you
9717780	9725500	my SU goes to people who don't respect the word stop especially when the person
9725500	9733220	who is requesting that you stop happens to be autistic usually we're gonna tell
9733220	9737740	you to stop something if it's necessary or else if we don't see anything it's
9737740	9743380	going to be very ugly so when someone says I don't want to do this anymore
9743380	9751340	fucking respect them I'm in a pass because I'll sub tweet something and put
9751340	9754500	my foot in my mouth so low do you want to say anything yeah we say that if you
9754500	9757100	do the people that are driving in front of me on the way this show today they
9757100	9763020	were driving 20 miles an hour in a 35 what the hell come on people I get it

9775820	9783180	all right I think it's time to close up the list and see what the ants actual
9783180	9788540	results were here which I think I'd have to keep this answerable but not live I
9788540	9793780	think was the way I do this I have to remember this here it's a tricky thing

9883620	9889980	I don't get it anyway hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hello
9889980	9895420	you're on orange launch radio if you can hear us we can't hear you I thought I
9895420	9903780	heard hello I thought I heard a little Russell or something all right well I
9903780	9907580	don't think it works so you have to try calling back test your connection with
9907580	9910660	echo one two three that's somebody who calls a lot though so I'm surprised not
9910660	9913420	working I wonder if it's something about my computer but I thought I heard like a
9913420	9916060	little Russell in the background or something so I only had a computer for
9916060	9922500	you then dumbass me had to instead of Microsoft in their confusing language
9922500	9927740	system refresh your system restore so it is system restore back to factory
9927740	9932260	settings which dropped it from Windows 10 and Windows 8 don't if I did a system
9932260	9936580	refresher would have kept Windows 10 I actually I thanks to a very good friend
9936580	9940420	I have a code for Windows 10 actually sitting in my repository because it was
9940420	9944700	supposed to be for if a new computer oh well then perfect so there I might have
9944700	9947580	to look into that I could still play with Windows 8 on that laptop though for
9947580	9952020	the record you can get a code under their accessibility plan still oh really

10065260	10070340	you're on orange on its radio who's this what was my bad I muted my entire sound
10070340	10073740	system while I was gone for the whole weekend it did not realize I was trying
10073740	10077620	to call you guys that's okay it's just you know the joys of live radio what's
10077620	10081660	on your mind my friend okay first of all hi I'm Ron well y'all probably know
10081660	10087340	me by now but um I would hope so yeah as I'm coming back from my amazing trip
10087340	10091660	this weekend and listening to you guys are tuning radio I want to call an
10091660	10099740	objection on one of the titles on listless yes DJ hero okay why are we
10099740	10104480	objecting to DJ hero you don't need to make that a live experience that's what
10104480	10109080	a rave is for they still have those well isn't that isn't that kind of what we
10109080	10112600	were joking that the Just Dance thing basically is is that the Just Dance is
10112600	10117040	gonna be a rave for kids more or less I think it's gonna be more like the Just
10117040	10121760	Dance is gonna be on stage dancing and the kids will be watching it out like a
10121760	10126320	special VIP area where you can dance so like we go to a weird Al concert but
10126320	10130520	you're still like the performing music though like actual DJs mixing actual
10130520	10134320	songs together not just like playing one track to the next but like actually
10134320	10138880	doing live mashups and stuff that's actually talent versus some dumbasses
10138880	10142760	dressed up like the artists that originally sang those tracks but not
10142760	10148720	quite and then dancing to pre-recorded music so so what Jason did on the good
10148720	10157000	place for a short time not to spoil anything but basically that right so you
10157000	10161000	could I think and I think Ramos point is that that does I mean to be fair it does
10161000	10165200	kind of exist some club I do love Janet's rebound I know I know don't
10165200	10172040	spoil all right anyway JD and chat points out there's an event called booty
10172040	10175680	NSF that's really what it's called I've heard of this it's a mashup party yeah
10175680	10178560	I've always wanted to go to that I've heard of that oh yeah they always they
10178560	10181440	talk about that so I I can kind of see where I miss coming from saying that
10181440	10186480	event sort of already exists but to be fair to Loki's there is nothing under
10186480	10190720	that video game brand perhaps there could be some of that triple-a talent
10190720	10193840	that comes in although fat chance but you never know I mean there was that
10193840	10197720	there was that legendary press conference here what what year was it
10197720	10201780	was 2010 so whenever those games were announced like they had some that's a
10201780	10206320	major talent at the staple yeah it was like all these like Eminem and many on
10206320	10210200	and all these people like under one roof performing for these games I mean
10210200	10216400	Activision probably paid a ton of money for it but didn't go to that I know some
10216400	10219520	people I knew went to that I can't remember if Bobby was one of them or not
10219520	10226000	I didn't it was one of the years I didn't go so but there you go Rama I
10226000	10229640	guess that's our our rebuttal although it's it's a fair perspective you're
10229640	10233480	right some of that same stuff kind of already exists out there yeah on the
10233480	10237920	plus side um they don't have to worry about the cops coming in to break up the
10237920	10244300	rave that is true that is true I hey Rama before we let you go you said you
10244300	10247200	were on a great trip this weekend is that something for anime jam session
10247200	10251200	this week was it a convention or no this is something more like me Persil's
10251200	10255880	me just getting away for a while just kind of like my time to relax and
10255880	10264720	recharge and get back into the game eat pray beer oh yeah Oh works what Loki I
10264720	10267640	just got another the last minute all right well Rama we're gonna let you go
10267640	10270720	then I'm glad to hear you had a good trip and we'll check in with you again
10270720	10275760	awesome take care of y'all fight all right what'd you have for us Loki last
10275840	10281800	chance to get in last chance so there's gonna be a new rewards thing for Sony
10281800	10287080	rewards now through the PlayStation Network so guess what now those trophies
10287080	10292200	that you're earning they're actually worth something oh so basically you can
10292200	10297520	earn some of the PlayStation points they can be redeemed for like PlayStation
10297520	10301560	Network vouchers and other things so here's how it works so you get one you
10301560	10307160	have 100 silver trophies you can get 100 points or one point per trophy 25
10307160	10315600	gold trophies for 250 points or 10 platinum trophies for 1,000 points huh
10315600	10320440	so and you can like earn those I guess that's available through the service so
10320440	10327560	go in there if you've got some trophies you can get some free points all right
10327600	10331640	interesting how that stuff is making rewards in the real world I wonder if
10331640	10336000	we'll hear more about that at PSX that would be very interesting but anyway I
10336000	10339640	notice our phone is not lighting up so I think that's gonna do it for the
10339640	10345440	skype line tonight which means our show has about come to an end how sad but I
10345440	10348780	want to thank you guys for listening to our show tonight and helping it be a
10348780	10352200	success if you guys enjoyed what you heard here at orange launch rated
10352200	10355160	tonight don't forget to tell a friend or two about the show help us spread the
10355280	10358800	word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice but we can't put those

10362400	10365760	participate on discord and chat and all the places where we try to get your
10365760	10369000	voices in on the show and vote in listless they were not a part of that
10369000	10373720	scientific process maybe something else maybe hotline Miami would have won if
10373720	10377960	more of you would have voted for it so anyway tell a friend or two about the
