00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
We're an hour earlier and yet somehow still exactly the same time

00:17.000 --> 00:21.000
We hope you're well rested with the extra hour you gained last night because tonight you'll need that brain working

00:21.000 --> 00:27.000
We have news to catch up on, report, and make and it all starts right now in the show where every gamer has a voice

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello my friends and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice

00:36.000 --> 00:44.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight, episode number 706 of our show for this November the 5th of 2017

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
I almost said November the 2017 of the 5th

00:47.000 --> 00:52.000
Yes, remember the 5th of November or whatever that is, I never even saw that movie, I just heard about it through everybody else

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
You don't know about the actual Guy Fawkes day?

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
Whatever I read on Wikipedia and then promptly forgot

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Girl

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Hi DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers, how are you?

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
I'm your resident history nerd

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
And enjoying some decaf coffee tonight

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
My face is burnt now

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
I decided to punish DarkSakura tonight for what I don't know

01:12.000 --> 01:18.000
But I said you're going to drink this out of the DC Comics Justice League mug that I have because she's not a big fan of DC

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
But then Loki, Techmaster Loki over there suggested DC is decaf

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Decaf coffee

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
This DC decaf mug

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
Yes

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Perfect

01:28.000 --> 01:33.000
And for the record, remember remember the 5th of November the gunpowder treason and plot

01:33.000 --> 01:38.000
I know of no reason why the gunpowder treason should ever be forgot

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
Okay

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
That's how it goes, so whatever

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
Alright, props to you

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
And I could not in a train

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
Y'all need culture

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
Y'all wouldn't know culture if you got smacked in the face with yogurt

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
Remember remember, one fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Y'all bitches need culture

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
Listen to the muffins child, listen to the don'ts

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
Don't let the cat in the hat in your house because you'll fuck shit up

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
And you know what? Fucking banana muffin

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
Alright anyway, hi everybody, we got a busy week

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
So first I want to say sorry we weren't here last week and that was totally my fault

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
I had no voice at all last week

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
When I woke up Saturday morning I had hosted Rocky the night before

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
And I guess I was a little more extra than usual because it was Halloween after all

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
And so when I woke up on Saturday

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
It was literally like this

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
And I didn't know it

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
Like you should have asked Alan about how I sounded, it wasn't pretty

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
And so I have to make a judgement call on if there's going to be a show or no show

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
Because there's not going to be a show, Dark Soccer and Loki should get their evening back

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
So around 2 o'clock I was still sounding like this

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
So I was like alright we're not doing a show because I have to rest my voice because I need it for my job

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
So sorry guys but shit happens

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
So that's what happened last week

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
Sadly we won't be here next week

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
That was the pre-planned week off because of the long Veterans Day weekend

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
I'm actually going to be out of town

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
I'm going to Seattle so hoping to hit up some gaming related fun places while I'm up there

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
I just found out today

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
I'm going to go visit an old friend

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
I'm going to visit an old friend from LiveJournal who I've never met before

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
She lives in Bellevue so I get to go over there which I haven't been to before

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
I think that's just a stone's throw away from where

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
Where's Nintendo and Microsoft? Redmond?

03:22.000 --> 03:26.000
Yeah I gotta travel there just to look at an office building

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Because that's what they are, office buildings

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
There's nothing that exciting but at least I can say I went

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
You have to go to the Pinball Museum in Seattle

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
Is there a Pinball Museum in Seattle?

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
There is, I'll have to find out where

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
I'll send you the address

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Yeah tell me where it is, I wouldn't mind hitting that up

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
Because we did all the big touristy stuff last time we were there

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
So we've done the Space Needle, we did the EMP, we did all that stuff

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
So I mean we'll probably do some of it again

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
But I wouldn't mind seeing other parts of Seattle too

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
So we'll see

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
Anyhow so we've got to make this show really good

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
Because it's got to last for a few weeks for people

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
So sorry about that

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
You can also of course join us live

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
We do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
vognetwork.com

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
Usually right after our pal Bobby Black Wolf

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
But we're not the only one that's been having issues lately

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
Bobby's been having internet drama

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
That's been keeping him offline

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
He doesn't have enough bandwidth at home I guess

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
Something in his neighborhood has screwed something up

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
And here's my thought Bobby

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
Maybe it's somebody's Xbox

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Because I want to talk about this

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
So this is some drama that is like unfolding on Twitter as we speak

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
Because I had a pretty serious problem today

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
And it's my Xbox's fault

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
Now let me tell you what's going on

04:37.000 --> 04:43.000
So I get online today and I'm setting up for the show tonight by logging on to vognetwork.com

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
But I get a new pop-up window that I don't usually get on vognetwork.com

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
And it's Xfinity

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
And I was like wow I've never seen that before

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
And Xfinity actually popped, which is Comcast

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
They popped up a thing that said you are at 90% of your bandwidth for the month

04:56.000 --> 05:01.000
You have used 900 and something gigs out of your 1024 that are available

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
Because everybody has a terabyte of data a month now

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
It used to be like 250 and then it's been slowly climbing up

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
Well I was like the fuck?

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
And they were like for the calendar month

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
And I'm like it is the 5th of November

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
And I've used a terabyte of data this month

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
I'm like what the fuck's going on?

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
So I log into the Comcast website

05:23.000 --> 05:28.000
And sure enough most months we use about maybe 380 gigs

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
I think last month there was 410 gigs

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
But I downloaded Destiny 2 PC last month right?

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
So it's going to be a little more

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
But usually we use between 300 and 400 gigs

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
Which is pretty impressive considering there's two tech nerds in this house

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Myself and my husband

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
I do this radio show on Sunday Night from here

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
And I've been doing live streaming

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
And you probably watch Netflix and all that

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
Yeah I binge watch Stranger Things 2 when that first came out

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
So we use a lot of technology

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
But sure enough it was like

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
At this point it said I'd use something like

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
1050 gigs or something like that

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
I was like what the hell is going on?

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
Well luckily my pal Xtifer

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
Who you guys remember from Guys on a Show

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
He bought me as a Christmas present this last year

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
A Google Wifi

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
And the reason why this helps right now is because

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
On Google Wifi you can with the phone app

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
Go in and it shows you which devices are connected

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
What's using bandwidth right now

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
And you can pull a report for the last 7 days

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
The last 30 days

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
So I was like alright well I remember that

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
So I was like I want to see is it on my computer

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
Is it on Alan's computer

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
Is there an unknown device that's figured out our Wifi password

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
That's downloading all of the porn

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
Like what's going on?

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
So I go onto the Google

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
The Google Wifi and I pull the report and it says

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
My Xbox has pulled down

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
I think it's 940 gigabytes

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
In the past 7 days

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
940

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
By itself

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
The Xbox

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
I have a 1 terabyte drive on the Xbox One

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
So I started

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
Obviously I did what anybody does

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
And I wrote passive aggressive tweets about the situation

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Tagging Xfinity and tagging

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Xbox because I'm sitting here going

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
The Xfinity website is like you get charged

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
$10 for every 50 gigs you go over

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
And I'm like fuck that

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
I didn't do anything

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
So I called and

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
They told me that you get like

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
2 courtesy months

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
Or something

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
Like you get months where you're allowed to go over

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
And they don't penalize you

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
So this month is going to end up being a courtesy month

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
I guess for me

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
I'm going to download all the porn now

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
Might as well at this point right

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
But I'm still kind of shocked

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
Like what the hell happened

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
So obviously one thing that's on my mind

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
That I think a lot of people are suggesting on Twitter

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
Because now one of my buddies

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
Who runs another podcast that's more popular than this one

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
Retweeted like all my tweets

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
I don't know if he was having the same problems or what

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
But now I've got all these people that are giving me suggestions

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
And everybody is kind of saying

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
Well do you have an Xbox One X

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
That's the first question I get

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
The answer is no

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
I have not changed my Xbox One

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
Since Forza Horizon 2 was new

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
And that was the game that convinced me to get a new Xbox

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
I bought my Xbox when they just released

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
That one terabyte model

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
So I do have a one terabyte Xbox One

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
But still

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
Why is my Xbox trying to download

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
940 gigs to my one terabyte Xbox One

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
So I unplugged the fucker

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
I was like you're done

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
I unplugged it

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
The one thing the Comcast guy suggested I do

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
Which I was like oh yeah that's kind of obvious

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
He said change your Wi-Fi pass

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
Or just make sure nobody else has it

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
He's like cause I can't see on my end

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
What devices are using your bandwidth

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
And I'm sitting here going

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
I just fucking told you it's my Xbox

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
But I'm like don't get mad at the call center people

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
They're just doing their job

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
So I was like alright you know what

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
Why not

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
Is changing your Wi-Fi password a bad idea

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
No it's not

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
So I went ahead and did that

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
So now I plug back in the Xbox

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
I'm just not going to give the Xbox the new password

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
Trying to figure out what's going on

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
And I do notice it's trying to download

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
A 43 gigabyte update for Quantum Break

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
And I'd heard that Quantum Break was getting a big update

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
But I don't have a 4K TV

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
I don't have an Xbox One X

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
I don't understand why

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
Was it attempted to download it like 20 times

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
That's what I think is happening

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
That it's been attempted

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
Now I can't prove this yet

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
But I don't have a lot of space left on my Xbox One

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
I filled that thing to the brim

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
That terabyte

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
I mean because I don't usually delete things

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
Because why should I

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
So it's like 92% full

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
So I'm wondering if

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Is it trying to download

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
The Quantum Break update

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Failing and starting over

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
Over and over again

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Possibly

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
So here's

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
It should be smart to see that it can't fit on there

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
So it can't update it

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
That's what it does on the PlayStation

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
That's

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
And that

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
Geez Microsoft learn

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
But here's the weird thing you guys

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
I can't

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
Like nobody else on Twitter is complaining about this

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
So I can't sit here and go

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
Microsoft's got a big problem

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
This is widespread

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
Where's the news story on Kotaku

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
Alerting everybody about this

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
Because it does seem like

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
I'm the only guy that this is happening to

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
But here's my first question everybody

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
Would you go look at your bandwidth report

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
For the month

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
And especially if you have Google Wi-Fi

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
Or something similar that will tell you

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
What your Xbox is doing

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
And would you let me know

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
If anybody else out there

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
Is having this extreme problem

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
That I'm having

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
Just makes me glad I never bought one

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
I guess but I mean

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
I don't know what to think

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
Like I want to say I feel bad for Microsoft

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
But I don't

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
But it's weird that this is isolated

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
Like that's the

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
And so it makes me wonder did I do something wrong

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
But I haven't done anything outside the norm

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
I barely use my Xbox One for gaming

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
It's just a Microsoft device

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
It likes updating on the fly

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
Here's a thought

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
That maybe you have enough

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Because you know there's a difference between

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
Actual size and virtual space right

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
Right

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
So it could mean that you have enough in one aspect

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
But the moment that it's filling up the cache

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
It's hitting that point where it can't

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
But it's still reading that you've got room for it

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
Yeah I don't know

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
So you just might be at a sweet spot for that

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
Interesting

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
Or in this case a sour spot

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Well I'm gonna go look at some comments in chat

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Because everybody's playing armchair IT

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Which when you get a bunch of nerds together

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
That's what's going to happen

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
Not me I'm not at work

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
So in our chat room

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
Over at live.vognetwork.com

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
Because again we do tape live

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
Six o'clock Pacific

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
Nine o'clock Eastern

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Oh and Bobby, thank you very much

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
Bobby Blackwolf did make it to chat tonight

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
And he says he fixed the web chat

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
So if live.vognetwork.com wasn't working for you before

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
It might now

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
Because he changed the web app

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
So hopefully it'll work again

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
Thanks Bobby

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
Speaking of armchair IT

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
Let's see

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
I'm looking in chat

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
Tigerclaw says

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
When you leave your Xbox One in an instant on mode

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
Whenever you get one of those free Xbox One games

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
It'll automatically download them too

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
So it's best to have power saving mode enabled

11:44.000 --> 11:48.000
I've never had a game download that I didn't tell it to

11:48.000 --> 11:52.000
Like I will go into the Xbox gold membership thing

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
And download what I

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
But I've never had the Xbox just say

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
Surprise we delivered you a game

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
So I don't have that setting on

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
I have had it update games

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
But that's

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
I mean

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
Usually you want that right

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
Isn't that what PlayStation Plus had as a feature

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
When it first launched was auto updating games

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
Yeah I mean that's what PlayStation does now

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
But like if I don't have space for the update

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
It knows it's like well this isn't gonna fit

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
So we're not updating

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
Bobby Blockwolf says

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
I think the Xbox One actually has a thing in settings

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
That shows its data usage

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
A I can't find it

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
But probably B because

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
For it to do anything it wants to go online

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
And I'm sure as you all can sympathize right now

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
I don't want to put my Xbox One back online

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
Although I guess if this month is gonna be a wash anyway

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
Maybe now's the time to do it

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
When I can sit there and watch it

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
But I'd prefer to know at least a little bit about what I'm doing

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
Before I put it back online if that makes sense

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
Maybe I can tell

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
I bet through Google Wi-Fi

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
I bet I can let it go online

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
But like throttle it

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
I think Google Wi-Fi lets you do that

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
I think you can say

12:58.000 --> 13:02.000
This device can use no more than X amount of data per second or something

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
So maybe that's what I'll do

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
I gotta say

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
The winner in this whole scenario is Google Wi-Fi

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
So props to that

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
Because that helped me figure out what it is

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
So that when people on the internet are like

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
Are you sure you didn't get hacked

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
Or how do you know it's your Xbox

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
It's like I got the receipts

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
Receipts, I has them

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
Here they are

13:23.000 --> 13:27.000
Korkay in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
Go for the high score

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
Why not?

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
Why not?

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
Even though I kind of promised him I wasn't gonna do that

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
But there you go

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
Alright

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
So yeah some folks in chat

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
SSU100Matt says I'm only seeing I use 15 gigs

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
Tigerclass says I'm only using 49 gigs

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
Well good for y'all

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
Yeah I know

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
But that's the weird

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
Those guys have Xbox ones

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
And so what is unique about my situation

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
I don't know

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
I can't figure it out

13:54.000 --> 13:58.000
But I can tell you it's trying to download an update for Quantum Break and Forza

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
And I put all the screenshots on my Twitter

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
Twitter.com slash Skye S-K-I-E

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
If you wanna continue to play Armchair Warrior

14:05.000 --> 14:09.000
I tagged Xbox in all these posts so maybe Xbox support will fire me back something

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
But I don't

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
Like

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
Here's the thing at the end of the day

14:13.000 --> 14:18.000
I don't particularly care if my Xbox is gonna download all of this data

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
I care that I'm gonna get charged for it

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
So

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
And especially if this isn't just happening to me

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
You know what I'm saying?

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Really just fuck Comcast

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
Cause that's really the problem

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
Cause if you had unlimited bandwidth as we should all

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
It wouldn't even be an issue

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
That's true

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
So there's you know

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
But I also think the system

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
The Xbox should be smart enough

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
That like

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
There should be some type of internal trigger

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
That when it's used a hundred gigabytes in a month

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
Or two hundred gigabytes in a month

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
It should pop up a window going

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
I'm eating a lot of data and this is why

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
Do you wanna continue?

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
Like at least give me the option to put

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
Cause I would have never known this was happening

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
If that pop up

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
From Xfinity

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
So to Comcast credit

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
If they hadn't put a pop up

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
That said you've used ninety percent

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
Hey it looks like that you've used a lot of data

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
Would you like me to download some more data for you?

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
Says Clippy

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
There you go

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
So that's the drama I've been dealing with

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
So stay tuned for potentially an update in two weeks

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
But for right now the Xbox One is sitting in the corner

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
It is not allowed to have the new Wi-Fi password

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
That is the punishment

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
Grounded dammit

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
You're grounded and you're not getting the Wi-Fi password

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
That is what's happening

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
Loki and DarkSakura got the new Wi-Fi password

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
But the Xbox did not get the Wi-Fi password

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
Now that I know that I can download as much as I want

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
I'm downloading all the porn right now so it's fine

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
Like Corky said earlier in chat

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
Go for the high score

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
Why not?

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
Come on Nolgus in chat says

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
Does Xbox have a beta thing

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
Xbox Insider or something?

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
You know what for the sake of transparency

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
Yes they do

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
And I'm in it

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
So is that

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Is the problem because my console is doing something

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
In a beta mode

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
Which I understand

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
Microsoft's gonna wash your hands of liability

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
If that thing happened or whatever

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
No that's just usually

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
It just means it downloads more frequent

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
System updates

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
980 gigs of updates

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
Good

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
I mean but I doubt it would

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
I doubt it would keep doing that though

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
Yeah

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
Because usually it would just download

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
You know the latest one

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
Brad from Paw Culture says

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
You have the Xbox on Wi-Fi

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
That has to be rough on gaming

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
No

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
I actually

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
Right now because the PlayStation 4

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Moved into my office

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
So I could do streaming from the PlayStation 4

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
My Xbox One has become the CBS

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
So I can watch Star Trek Discovery device

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
Netflix for when I binge watched

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
Stranger Things 2

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
When we weren't here last week

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
Device

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
So it's been kind of my main media device

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Maybe it's Star Trek Discovery's fault

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Did Star Trek Discovery break my Xbox

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
Maybe it did

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
Perhaps I don't know

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
But all those things have been running fine

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
And great quality

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
I don't have 4K

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
My television isn't 4K

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
So I wasn't downloading like 4K Stranger Things

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
But still

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
And again that was all technically October

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
Because I watched that Stranger Things

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
Like in the first three days

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
You guys it is so good

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
It is so good

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
Stranger Things in 4K

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
Except for Episode 7

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
Fuck Episode 7

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
But The Resident's fine

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
Which one was Episode 7?

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
The one that was

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Without spoiling

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
The Back Door Pilot

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
The Back Door Pilot

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
Oh yeah

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
That little

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
I don't know

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
I liked the main person in that one

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
Yeah me too

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
Me too

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
A lot

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
Plus I liked the makeover

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
Yeah

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
We have to keep it

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
Plus it was all MTV

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
Some people are very hyper about spoilers

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
I know

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
That's all I'm saying

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
When do we get to spoil the shit out of Stranger Things?

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
I guess we have to give it a good 60 days

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
Huh?

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
2018?

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
I don't know

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
Too soon

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
Anyway

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
I guess also that's kind of the department of critical myth

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
Pod culture

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
The more TV based shows on our network to get into

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
We're usually here to talk about games

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
I do want to talk about games

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
So the kickoff topic I did want to talk about

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Was I wanted to talk a little bit about

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
Digital distribution

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Now this is a topic that's come up on our show before

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
But

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
I don't know if you guys heard about this this week

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
But there were some major earnings calls

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
That happened in this past week

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
Activision, EA

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
They do their quarterly stockholder calls

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
Because at the end of the day

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
Companies like EA, Activision

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
They exist

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
What?

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
To make money

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
To make who money?

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
To make their shareholders money

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
And that's why people talk about investing in the stock market

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
Right?

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
America 101

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
There you go

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
Okay

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
So every quarter

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
These companies have to basically produce

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
You know

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
They have to update their shareholders on what they're doing

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
So Activision did an earnings call this past week

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
Where they said

18:40.000 --> 18:46.000
50% of Destiny 2's sales on consoles came via download

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
Rather than a retail disc

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
Now

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
I would have believed that

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
If we were talking the PC numbers only

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
Because I would have thought

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
Oh there's a ton of people

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
That probably just do digital on PC

18:56.000 --> 19:00.000
Because of storefronts like Battle.net and so forth

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
And that there's people that are buying Destiny with Warcraft gold

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
Because you can do that

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
The way things are set up on Battle.net

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
But no

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
That factor is for

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
I guess all of it

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
Or for the consoles

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
I buy everything digitally

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
For the most part

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
Yeah

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
And I guess this is getting bigger and bigger

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
Earlier this year

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
EA said

19:20.000 --> 19:25.000
They expect 40% of their console game sales to come from downloads in 2017

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
That is a jump up 10% from where they were at

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
30% of sales in 2016

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
EA has gone on record before saying

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
Quote

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
They're gonna be 100% digital company period

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
It's going to be there someday

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
It's inevitable

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
No

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
And I don't think that's gonna be the case

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
Because here's the problem

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
Yes

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
It's a nice idea to have it all digital and everything

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
But if everybody goes all digital

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
Remember there's that wonderful company

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
Comcast

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
That has those wonderful bandwidth caps

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
That will fuck you over

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
Right

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
If you try to download everything

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
So that's why it will never be that way

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
Because fucking net neutrality and all that shit is

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
Not in the picture because

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Those companies want to make money too

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
So

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
Because you have that

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
And also because

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
And this is very important

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
These same fucking companies

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
Keep pushing these stupid

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Collectors editions

20:17.000 --> 20:20.000
And shit with giant statue editions

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
You can't digitally download those

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
You can't digitally download a statue

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
You wouldn't want to digitally download a statue

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
Correct

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
Okay

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
So you think there's still going to be a market

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
For physical stuff

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
But it's gonna be kind of limited

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
It's gonna be like

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
They do it now

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
They can still do digital distribution

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
But they do it now where they have editions

20:40.000 --> 20:43.000
It's collectors editions that don't include the game

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
Why?

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
I know

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
Why would you do that?

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
So

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
Well is it because they expect that people are gonna

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
Download to play hour zero digitally

20:52.000 --> 20:55.000
So this is just literally a box of shit

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
With the games branding on it

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
I mean like for me like if I'm gonna

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
If I'm looking forward to a game

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
And I want to play it day one

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
I'm not gonna pre-order

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Because that means I gotta drive out to the store

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
To go pick it up and do all that nonsense

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
Whereas I can

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
Digitally pre-order it or download it

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
Fuck I'm not pre-ordering shit

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
But I'll digitally order it like

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
The day before or something like that

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
And it'll unlock at 9pm the night before it comes out

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
That's what I did with Destiny 2 on PC

21:24.000 --> 21:28.000
Is that I bought it like two days before it launched

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
So it would be all loaded and ready to go

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
But with Destiny 2 I knew

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
If I walked into a store and bought it on a box

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
All I was gonna get

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
Maybe I was gonna get a Blu-ray or DVD with the game

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
But it was likely gonna be a code

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
And a game like that is so much online anyway

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
You're gonna get some code for your online access

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
So there's no reason to really have the physical edition

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
Whereas here's my thing

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
I guess I've had the hardest time buying into this digital stuff

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Because I'm still this big believer of

21:58.000 --> 22:01.000
Well when you buy a game on a disc or on a cartridge

22:01.000 --> 22:04.000
Let's say Mario Odyssey on the flip side of things

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
I have a cartridge for that

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
And if someday I decide I'm sick of Mario Odyssey

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
Which I doubt is gonna happen

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
But we'll get into that later

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
I could sell that cartridge

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
Or I could loan that

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
What happened to that?

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
It's because I'm lazy

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
Two things

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
One, I'm lazy

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
So I don't wanna have to worry about selling that cartridge

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
Or whatever

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
And it depends on the system

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
Like if I had a Switch

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
There's not a lot of onboard storage for that

22:28.000 --> 22:32.000
Then yes, physical copies are gonna be more appealing to me

22:32.000 --> 22:36.000
Whereas I've got 500GB of space on my Playstation 4

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
So I can download a bunch of games at once

22:38.000 --> 22:41.000
And I don't have to worry about swapping discs out and stuff like that

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
Not to say that I don't buy disc versions of games

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
I do sometimes

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
It's just not all the time

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
Usually I'm getting stuff on sale

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
But with that

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
There's also another factor

22:53.000 --> 22:57.000
GameStop is not gonna really be happy with them going all digital

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
They've tried to do it in the past

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
They've tried to say that they're gonna go all digital

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
Never gonna happen

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
Because it's such a big monster

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
And they control the industry

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
So they're not gonna

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
It's not gonna happen

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
They're never gonna be fully digital

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
Because there's people that want physical versions of the game

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
There's gonna be GameStop

23:15.000 --> 23:18.000
And other big retailers that that's a big chunk of their money

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
Well GameStop, it's most of their money

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
So they're not gonna just give that up quietly

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
And bandwidth caps

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
You're not gonna be able to do that

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
Plus internet speeds

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
Because as these games get bigger and bigger

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
The 4K content

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
That's more data that you're dumping down the tubes

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
And it's gonna take a lot longer to download

23:34.000 --> 23:38.000
Especially with all these internet companies fighting to upgrade their service

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
I wanted to get to DarkSakura's perspective

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
But real quick

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
I wanted to mention

23:42.000 --> 23:45.000
I was noticing a lot of parallels maybe with the music industry

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
You know 10 years ago with the invention of the iPod or whatever

23:48.000 --> 23:51.000
And you know just the fact that a lot of people were pirating their music

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
With things like Napster or whatever

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
Apple kind of came up with this method to legitimize it

23:55.000 --> 23:58.000
A lot of other people kind of went on that as well

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
But anyway my point is

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
A lot of record stores are gone because of it

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
Tower Records

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
Gone

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
The Warehouse

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
Gone

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
All these big record stores I remember from my youth they're gone

24:07.000 --> 24:10.000
Now that's left are indie niche places

24:10.000 --> 24:13.000
You know like we have a local chain here, Dimple

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
You know they seem to do pretty well because

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
They also expand the books and movies

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
Yeah that's true

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
They've also expanded to books and movies

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
And I noticed

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
What's the music that people seem to be buying these days?

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
Vinyl

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
Vinyl

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
Exactly

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
And it's kind of that collector's edition stuff

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
I found a place downtown

24:31.000 --> 24:35.000
Because I was when I had to get my window replaced on my Fiat

24:35.000 --> 24:38.000
And I was at this little place like 16th and E

24:38.000 --> 24:42.000
And walked around down E to go have breakfast at this little place called Shine

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
Have you ever been there?

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
No

24:44.000 --> 24:47.000
But on the way there there's like this little like thrift store

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
But it was all full of fucking vinyl

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
Nothing but vinyl in a thrift store

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
Yeah and speaking of I'm going on this trip to Seattle

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
And I remember one of the things I bought on my last trip to Seattle

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
This is like seriously one of my prized possessions

25:00.000 --> 25:04.000
This is my copy of Abba's The Visitors

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
My favorite album from one of my favorite bands

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
I bought you one

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
Probably my favorite band ever

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
You did

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
I got you Super Trooper

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
You got me Super Trooper

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
But this is the one that I got in Seattle at Pike Place Market

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
At a very similar store

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
It was like a thrift store but it was all vinyl

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
And I was like do they have Abba, Abba, Abba, Abba

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
And then they had the visitors

25:20.000 --> 25:24.000
What's that place in San Francisco on Market near Castro?

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
Is that Rasputin?

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
Yeah I think it's Rasputin

25:26.000 --> 25:29.000
Because that's used to where I would go to buy laser discs

25:29.000 --> 25:33.000
Like I found my Wizard of Oz laser disc there

25:33.000 --> 25:37.000
It's like two places down from like the Brody salon

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
But it's like right there at Market in Castro

25:40.000 --> 25:43.000
J.D. has regrets to inform us they closed

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
Sad

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat saying

25:47.000 --> 25:53.000
I buy new albums on vinyl now and get the free MP3 download for the USB stick in my car

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
So

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
I have one

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
I only have a handful of albums

25:58.000 --> 26:02.000
I have a copy of Rubber Soul because that was my favorite Beatles album

26:02.000 --> 26:07.000
I have Gorillaz Demon Days which I have it unopened

26:07.000 --> 26:10.000
So if I need a quick 500 bones I could sell it

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
Because it's a first printing

26:12.000 --> 26:16.000
I have two Rodale albums

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
I have Even Worse and then I have Mandatory Fun

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
Because we got them to sign it

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
Yeah I mean I don't even own a record player

26:22.000 --> 26:25.000
So the only reason I own that Abba on vinyl

26:25.000 --> 26:29.000
Is because it is a relic of the time period from which that album came out

26:29.000 --> 26:33.000
And that record was likely used to play that music

26:33.000 --> 26:38.000
You know what I mean like it's more the collector thrift store kind of atmosphere of it

26:38.000 --> 26:41.000
It's very hard to explain but I bet a lot of you that have bought vinyls

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
Probably understand

26:42.000 --> 26:47.000
It's more the fact that you know I own something of that time period that is that album

26:47.000 --> 26:50.000
I almost bought a Panasonic record player at that place

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
Well the record player is coming back

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
You know why?

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
Anyway let me

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
Wait it had an 8 track player

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
We've been too far into music which you know I know a lot of us love music

26:57.000 --> 27:00.000
But Jamie what are your thoughts quickly on the digital versus

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
Especially because you've been a big collector

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
But I don't know how much you guys have embraced digital

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
But what's kind of your thoughts when you hear EA saying

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
We're going to be a 100% digital company

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
Okay

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
I kind of don't care

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
Okay if it wasn't EA saying it what about Activision?

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
Still don't care

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
Still don't care because then

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
Probably even less so

27:22.000 --> 27:27.000
I mean like look at all of the like World of Warcraft

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
Look at Overwatch

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
Look at all that

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
Right

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
Those are already digital only pretty much

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
Right

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
I mean you used to be able to get discs for them

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
But computers aren't even built with DVD drives anymore

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
You know

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
I'm like this

27:44.000 --> 27:48.000
My thought is that if I download a game

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
That I want to keep badly enough

27:50.000 --> 27:53.000
I'm going to copy those files off to external media

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
And have an archive

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
I do that anyway with my stuff

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
You know my um

27:59.000 --> 28:02.000
For example I mean my iTunes directory right

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
It's all housed on an external drive

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
I manage that shit myself

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
My games are exactly the same way

28:08.000 --> 28:11.000
I have two internal drives one of them that's for all of my games

28:11.000 --> 28:15.000
And it's marked so that I can take it out and put it in enclosure if I want to

28:15.000 --> 28:18.000
And I have my 3 terabyte drive that I save all of my save files to

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
So

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
And the point of all this

28:22.000 --> 28:25.000
Is that the PSP Go is just ahead of its time

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
Really wasn't it

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
No

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
I mean

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
It was ahead of something

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
I don't think it had a lot of storage

28:33.000 --> 28:38.000
And the problem with the PSP Go is their stupid proprietary memory stick shit

28:38.000 --> 28:41.000
That's also the other thing that kind of hurt the Vita

28:41.000 --> 28:45.000
Is because they want to charge extra for their proprietary memory stick formats

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
So that

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
They can make more money

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
It's all about greed

28:49.000 --> 28:52.000
That's the other thing about these companies saying oh we're going 100% digital

28:52.000 --> 28:58.000
Do you really want them to be the only source of being able to purchase those files

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
Because if they go all digital

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
That means that there's no competition anymore

29:02.000 --> 29:06.000
Because they're selling their game on one store front

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
And that's it

29:08.000 --> 29:11.000
And there's not a chance that you're going to get it on sale

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
I mean they do sales every now and then

29:13.000 --> 29:17.000
But you know it's a lot more prevalent with physical versions

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
So it just

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
And plus they're fucking lame

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
But they're fucking you know

29:23.000 --> 29:26.000
Microtransaction bullshit that they're piecing shit apart

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
That's where they're making most of their money digitally

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
Is from that shit

29:30.000 --> 29:33.000
And not necessarily I don't think selling digital copies

29:33.000 --> 29:37.000
So Orange Dontradio we do like to say we are the show where every gamer has a voice

29:37.000 --> 29:40.000
In an effort to kind of expand that and get more voices on our show

29:40.000 --> 29:43.000
Tried something new this week and went to our Discord with this topic

29:43.000 --> 29:48.000
Again you can join us on Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
That will get you the invite you need to get on there

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
You don't need a special code outside of that

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
Just go to vognetwork.com slash Discord

29:54.000 --> 29:57.000
And I asked our members on Discord their opinions on this

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
Let me read you some of the answers from Discord

29:59.000 --> 30:02.000
Corky said I buy digital games when they're cheaper

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
Or when they're PC games that are just a code in a box

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
I've never owned a current gen console

30:07.000 --> 30:11.000
So paying $60 for a game and trading it in after isn't something I've been able to do

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
I do sell old games on eBay to pay for my gaming habit

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
But it's a fairly rare occurrence

30:16.000 --> 30:19.000
Evil G will probably be a general geek culture store

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
Like it's slowly transitioning to

30:21.000 --> 30:26.000
My local one is probably one third ugly Funko Pops and clothing

30:26.000 --> 30:29.000
I think you know what speaking of the Funko Pops

30:29.000 --> 30:32.000
And look I own a few of them myself admittedly

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
I have the Golden Girls Funko Pops

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
I have a Winston from Overwatch sitting there

30:36.000 --> 30:39.000
We really need to draw the line on those things

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
Like those fuckers are everywhere

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
I found them at a thrift store

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
I'm kinda over it you guys

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
Like we need something new

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
Like Funko Pops are losing cool points

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
Let people love what they love

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
You're right, you're right

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
You spend your hard earned money on whatever you want

30:55.000 --> 31:01.000
But it's crazy going into like half the stores in the mall have an entire wall dedicated to it

31:01.000 --> 31:06.000
And it's like do we need that many Funko Pops?

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
You haven't seen my cube

31:08.000 --> 31:11.000
How many Funko Pops do you have in your cube at work?

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
Too many to count

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
No I know what I have

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
I have a baby group

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
I have a regular group

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
I don't need the whole inventory just a number

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
No I'm actually going through it

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
That's five on that one

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
Alright while you count

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
Dark Tetsuya talking about

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
Eleven in my cube

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
Dark Tetsuya talking about

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
I'm not super into mainstream AAA titles

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
But I definitely prefer physical whenever I can

31:34.000 --> 31:39.000
A lot of indie publishers are doing physical releases for their upcoming Switch titles

31:39.000 --> 31:42.000
Like I believe Limited Run Games is starting to do that

31:42.000 --> 31:46.000
Maybe I'm old school but I just like seeing my game collection on the shelf

31:46.000 --> 31:49.000
And with physical releases sometimes you get extras

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
Like Mighty No. 9 came with a poster, an art book

31:51.000 --> 31:54.000
It's just not the same as a downloadable PDF in my opinion

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
But also Mighty No. 9 came with Mighty No. 9

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
So you know you have that too

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
Stop

32:02.000 --> 32:05.000
Yeah you know the thing with the physical releases on Switch though

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
As cool as that is

32:06.000 --> 32:09.000
A lot of them are coming way after the game is released

32:09.000 --> 32:12.000
And it's not like I don't ever buy digital games

32:12.000 --> 32:16.000
Like sure I buy $20 indie games on Switch

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
On PlayStation and so forth

32:18.000 --> 32:22.000
Sure I buy those but that's because they're $20 games

32:22.000 --> 32:26.000
They're not $60 games that I might want to sell

32:26.000 --> 32:29.000
And try to get like $15 of it back someday

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
I don't know

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
Other comments

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
JD in our Discord saying

32:34.000 --> 32:37.000
I prefer digital but I'll buy whatever's cheaper

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
Unless there's a strong reason for one or the other

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
I like digital because you can't lose the cartridge

32:41.000 --> 32:44.000
And stuff tied to your account is good for data recovery

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
But now that we have two Switches

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
Being able to pass a cartridge back and forth

32:48.000 --> 32:52.000
Means my husband can play games without buying a second copy

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
And Tigerclaw over on Discord said

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
Most people prefer physical

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
Well that's

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
That may not be what EA's telling us but anyway

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
Because digital has its limitations

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
Such as you running out of hard drive space

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
Or when a digital game is removed from the store

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
Which would prevent you from ever buying it

33:08.000 --> 33:09.000
Oh that's true

33:09.000 --> 33:12.000
Bringing up the point of delisting of games

33:12.000 --> 33:13.000
Like the PT demo

33:13.000 --> 33:14.000
You can't

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
I mean that's different because you didn't buy that

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
But I bet a lot of people would have bought that

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
But anyway you can't get that anymore

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
Right

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
So you know there's certain things that get delisted

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
You know Microsoft has this a lot

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
Rock band songs get delisted

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
You know and that's just part of the rights

33:27.000 --> 33:28.000
Or whatever goes with that

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
Anyway thanks you guys over on Discord

33:30.000 --> 33:34.000
vognetwork.com slash Discord

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
Let's see going to some other comments in our chat

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
Over at live.vognetwork.com

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
Ragenator says

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
With me being a PC gamer for five years now

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
I'm pretty damn good at finding all the sales and deals

33:44.000 --> 33:45.000
Right Rob?

33:45.000 --> 33:48.000
Yeah I mean obviously you call into the show a lot with those deals

33:48.000 --> 33:51.000
But again and I've said this a lot

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
I don't mean to sound like a broken record

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
But this is my perspective on this

33:55.000 --> 33:58.000
Is that when you buy a cartridge or something

33:58.000 --> 34:01.000
Now you have something that has value

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
And sometimes that value goes way up

34:03.000 --> 34:06.000
Like Dark Sakura's copy of what is it?

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
Like Symphony of the Night on Saturn or something

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
What's one of those games that goes up in value?

34:10.000 --> 34:11.000
Yeah that one might be it

34:11.000 --> 34:12.000
The more you own it

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
Right

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
Or like you just mentioned your Gorillaz album

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
You know went up to so much money

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
You know sometimes the value may go up

34:19.000 --> 34:22.000
If you are lucky enough to own a copy of

34:22.000 --> 34:25.000
Fucking what is it like Chrono Trigger on a cartridge still

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
That's still worth a lot of money right?

34:27.000 --> 34:28.000
So there's that

34:28.000 --> 34:29.000
Or Final Fight Guy

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
There's the value in your game

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
Ninja Gaiden Trilogy

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
But if the game is cheap enough

34:34.000 --> 34:35.000
Where you're like

34:35.000 --> 34:38.000
Eh I don't need any return on this investment

34:38.000 --> 34:42.000
I'm good spending five bucks to get a copy of Civ IV

34:42.000 --> 34:45.000
And all the expansions on a Steam sale

34:45.000 --> 34:48.000
Then for that that's kind of worth it to most people

34:48.000 --> 34:49.000
Because you know you're getting a game

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
That's probably worth much more than that

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
So you're not looking at the resale value

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
It's a big reason why I think humble bundles

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
Have done so well right?

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
So

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
Probably

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
Anyway thank you

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
Dungeon Buster naming some of the big collector's items

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
I'm trying to think of

35:02.000 --> 35:03.000
Panzer Dragoon Saga

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
Have it

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
Silver Gun

35:06.000 --> 35:07.000
Black Label Final Fantasy VII

35:07.000 --> 35:08.000
Have it

35:08.000 --> 35:09.000
So

35:09.000 --> 35:14.000
And I actually traded my original US Dragon Ball GT Final Bout

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
For

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
What was that game?

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
Blue Stinger

35:19.000 --> 35:20.000
And you know what?

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
It really isn't worth all that much money anymore

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
Magical Chase is worth some money

35:24.000 --> 35:29.000
Because it was the last US Turbo Duo game

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
And just to be fair

35:31.000 --> 35:32.000
Kaijuto in chat says

35:32.000 --> 35:35.000
I don't collect Funko but I still love them

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
I love watching how happy people get on YouTube

35:37.000 --> 35:38.000
When they find their pops fine

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
I didn't mean to crap on your fandom

35:41.000 --> 35:44.000
If you love your Funko Pops and more power to you

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
Just

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
Every store you guys

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
Have you been to them all lately?

35:49.000 --> 35:50.000
They're in like every store

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
They have a whole bunch half off at Barnes and Noble

35:52.000 --> 35:53.000
Yeah I guess that's true

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
I guess people are buying them for reasons

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
SSJ 100 Matt pointed it out

35:57.000 --> 36:01.000
Dragon Ball GT Final Bout went down way when they re-released it

36:01.000 --> 36:02.000
So it's

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
I mean

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
One of the games that never lost any value

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
Was Rondo of Blood

36:08.000 --> 36:09.000
Uh

36:09.000 --> 36:10.000
Uh

36:10.000 --> 36:11.000
Dracula X Rondo of Blood

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
Didn't Sweet Coat and Two kind of fall in value

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
When they finally put it out on Playstation 3?

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
I think maybe a little bit

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
But um

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
A little but not a lot

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
But I mean um

36:22.000 --> 36:23.000
You know

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
If anyone wants to give me $500

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
By the way you can have a copy of Ninja Gaiden Trilogy

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
Just saying

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
In the box

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
You've been trying to get rid of that for like a year

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
We just didn't put it on eBay again

36:33.000 --> 36:34.000
Alright

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
We could probably get money for it

36:36.000 --> 36:39.000
I mean we could at least get $350 for it I'm sure

36:39.000 --> 36:40.000
Alright

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
Well ok we've had enough talk about the digital distribution

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
Is that

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
Well let me just quickly

36:44.000 --> 36:47.000
Let me just quickly kind of ask this question

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
Cause I asked this to Discord

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
In five years

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
Where are we at with digital distribution

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
Is it 100% of the industry

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
Is it 80% of the industry

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
Just quickly let me go around the room

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
Where is this industry at in five years of digital distribution

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
Loki?

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
60%

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
That seems very conservative

37:06.000 --> 37:07.000
Yeah

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
Ok

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
I'm gonna go with 75

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
75%

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
Uh I

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
That's not accounting then for the 25%

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
That'll be pretty much all collector's items

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
Collector's editions

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
This is not where I want it to be

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
But I'm gonna say 90%

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
With the 10% being collector's edition

37:23.000 --> 37:26.000
The vinyls of video games basically

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
I think that we're gonna though see

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
A good number of like actual

37:30.000 --> 37:33.000
Brick and mortar stores going

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
Because it's all gonna be online

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
I think GameStop's in big trouble

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
I really do

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
GameStop is gonna go the way

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
If they don't change their business model

37:42.000 --> 37:45.000
They're gonna go exactly the way that like our blockbusters did

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
And all that

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
Because digital really is

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
And on top of that you know it's really

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
I think

37:52.000 --> 37:53.000
What's a good word

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
Attractive for the manufacturers

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
Because that's less in materials they have to pay

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
Less labor they have to pay

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
Less in shipping

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
They can put that money into advertising

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
And for digital content instead

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
And actually throttle

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
The sales of it if they run

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
You know hit a particular license number

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
All they have to do is just

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
Generate more licenses for it

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
So they're not the supply

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
Will always be there to meet the demand

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
Alright

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
Alright we'll

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
We'll probably dive into this topic again

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
I think this is something that is gonna be following

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
Our industry for a little while if you want to say something

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
And if you want to no longer participate at

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
Orangelaunchradio.com

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
In the meantime we're gonna talk about our gaming weeks

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
Because really it's been two weeks since we've been here

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
So let's talk a little bit about some of the games we've been

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
Playing this week

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
Some of the notable highlights

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
DarkSakura what have you been playing this week?

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
Idol Poring

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
Pokemon Go

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
You know

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
Me Tomo

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
I started Dragon Age Inquisition again

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
Because I fucking love that game

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
In fact my

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
Dragon Age fire got lit under me

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
By a dragon

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
Also

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
Crap what else was I playing

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
A little bit of Ragnarok online

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
And then I

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
I got a Switch

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
And three games

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
I acquired it

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
Now this is interesting because when I saw this on your Facebook

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
Which by the way I still need to like add you on Switch

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
I figured you would have just found me through the 3DS connection

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
Dan played it more than me already

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
Well I had each other eventually but

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
I assumed you bought one

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
My assumption was

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
Oh Mario Odyssey broke them

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
They finally got a Switch but you won it

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
I wasn't really supposed to say much about that

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
Oh sorry

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
But since no one knows where I work

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
So I did win it in a raffle

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
I was keeping it off

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
Social media for a reason

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
Oh sorry about that

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
Because some people do know where I work

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
I was in the raffle

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
They were doing cupcakes

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
At work

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
And I said you know what

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
I don't want a cupcake

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
Well I wanted a cupcake but I was being good

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
And I put my name in the raffle

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
One ticket in the raffle

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
Next thing I know look what you got

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
Wow

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
So I have a Switch

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
I had a Joy-Con with it in three games

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
There's no shame in that for the record

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
This is very common for any corporation to do

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
So you know this is common

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
But I still

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
Fair enough

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
So yeah

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
I have Arms, I have Breath of the Wild

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
And I have Mario Kart 8

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
And we are gonna put in our order

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
For Odyssey

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
Coming up

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
And it's been fun

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
But Dan decided he was gonna

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
Take over and play through Mario Kart 8

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
And then he got the demo for

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
Puyo Puyo Tetris

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
Because one of the things is that

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
I still

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
I read Japanese like maybe a semi-literate

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
Five year old

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
So going through Puyo Puyo Tetris

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
On PS4 was an adventure

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
And we eventually

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
Figured it out to where we could play against each other

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
And all that but Dan's like I can play it in English

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
Now meh

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
So here's the beauty of

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
A cartridge based world do you wanna just borrow my

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
Copy cause I rarely play it

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
Yeah if you guys really wanna play it just borrow my copy

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
Bring it back

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
This is like totally Playstation 4 type stuff here

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
You mean I can swap games without having to switch

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
Codes and being part of my family network

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
O M G

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
Yeah thank you

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
You're welcome

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
That'll be my makeup for Blabbing

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
Okay

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
But at any rate

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
It's been

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
It's been fun, the setup was super easy

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
I actually

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
I forgot my password but I could change it through Miitomo

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
Because it's linked to my Nintendo account

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
So it was pretty cool

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
I just put the picture up

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
Got requests already and I was like hey

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
This is sweet

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
So I've been having

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
We played a little bit of it but that means that I'm gonna start Breath of the Wild on my own

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
And not play over Dan's game which is on Wii U

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
Nice

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
So we have two copies of the same game on different systems

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
But it'll be interesting

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
Now you kind of spot those little differences maybe

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
Probably won't be much in the way of differences

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
Cause I don't think the Switch

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
Is that much more graphically

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
Advanced than the Wii U was

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
I don't think so either

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
I think

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
Everything looked really pretty though on our TV

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
Cause we have a 4K TV

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
And it was all clean and pretty

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
But Switch is only outputting

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
A 1080 top

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
It's all about using the emulator

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
To play that game

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
Cause then you can output some really good graphics

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
I did however

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
Look into the Breath of the Wild emulator

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
That they've got out there

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
Basically it's a Wii U emulator

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
But tweaked for Breath of the Wild

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
And so I've seen

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
I've actually gone on this kind of thing

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
For looking to see how the world was built

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
Cause I'm very interested in stuff like that

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
I mean you remember me in World of Warcraft

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
When we'd go do something and I'd stay in the instance

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
To just explore

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
You like to go do screenshots and stuff

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
You were big on that I remember

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
Well I haven't figured out how to do anything like that

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
In Final Fantasy XIV

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
I actually got my account fixed

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
Once I decide if I want to get the collector's edition

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
For Stormblood

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
Cause that's still $60

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
And I've got drag queens coming up

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
Hey

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
I'm buying both mine and Becky's tickets

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
I've got to pay her back for them

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
That's coming up in like two weeks

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
It is

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
And that weekend will be after

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
I have

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
Oh I'm not talking about that on the show either

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
More secrets

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
This one's a big secret but you know what it is

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
I think so yeah

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
Anything else for your gaming week?

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
I like

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
Cheese

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
Loki how was your gaming week?

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
I didn't play anything that I said I was going to play

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
What?

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
I know I got lazy

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
Oh well

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
I did end up playing a little bit of Minecraft

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
On Windows 10 the other day

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
Just to check out I really haven't played that in a long time

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
So it was a little bit different

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
And then

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
What else

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
I played some more of the stupid

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
Idol clicker game

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
For office space

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
Just because it's the thing to do

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
And

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
I

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
Don't think there's

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
Much else it was mostly updates

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
I had got everything cause I was gonna

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
I wanted to play VR and I was actually gonna go do that

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
The other day I had everything set up

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
And then all my controllers

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
Were dead

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
So I was like god dammit

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
So I finally charged everything but I still never

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
Got around to actually playing it again

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
But I have everything ready to go now

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
So I can bust out some VR games

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
From the PlayStation VR

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
Hopefully very soon and get all that stuff out of the way

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
Cause I have like 4 or 5 games that I've purchased

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
That I've been meaning to actually get to

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
But I haven't gotten to yet

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
So there's that and then

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
What else

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
Just reinstall some games on Steam

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
Cause it's gonna go play through some of that

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
Backlog stuff finally cause there's stuff on there

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
I'm like oh shit I forgot I have that

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
So yeah that's it

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
Alright my gaming week I have a lot

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
To catch up on so I was

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
A bit of a sheep I guess some of you want to call me

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
And I got an iPhone 10

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
But before you bring the sheep

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
Emojis at me here's the thing

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
I use my phone more than any other device

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
And the phone I was using

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
Was 3 years old so you know what

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
I'm worth it I earned it

45:30.000 --> 45:31.000
Treat yo self

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
Exactly treat yo self

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
And it is a nice piece of hardware

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
So I'm a fan so far

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
I think the animojis are kinda dumb

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
But Jamie did laugh

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
When I sent her the unicorn talking

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
I finally listened to it when I got home

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
Cause I was at work

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
But it popped up on

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
You know I'm looking at my messenger right now

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
And it pops up on my

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
Mac

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
And it actually saves them as little movies

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
So I can quite literally drag

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
It out to my desktop

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
Like I could with all of those Retsuko stickers I got

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
That's how I put one on Twitter

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
I sent it to

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
Alan even though he doesn't have an iPhone

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
I sent it to him and it just sent him a video

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
But I saved it to my own phone

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
And then I posted it to Twitter

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
I posted something stupid on Twitter

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
Why can't you just directly share those

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
To social media

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
Apple?

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
You might be able to I just didn't look into it

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
But the animoji isn't a separate program

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
It's built into the messenger

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
But if you're using SMS

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
It converts it to a video format

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
I did not buy the phone to be a talking unicorn

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
And yes I picked the unicorn

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
Because everybody else is picking the poop

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
Which is stupid

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
So I'm the unicorn which is awesome

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
And the first thing that comes out of this unicorn

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
Hey girl

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
I'm like

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
Oh Rob

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
Eyes detected

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
So anyway I've been playing more

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
Pokemon Go on that

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
Because it runs so good

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
And as a congratulations on your

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
Dumb new phone gift

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
Alan got me a gotcha

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
Which is like the Pokemon Go Plus

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
But you don't even have to push the fucking button

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
You just walk

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
And it plays the game for you

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
Which is awesome

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
Yes it's so easy

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
It's just you know

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
My Apple Watch will do that

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
But you don't even

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
Like do you have to tap the Apple Watch

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
I haven't honestly played with my Apple Watch

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
You used to have to tap it

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
But I think you can do a setting on it now

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
But the thing that I like about having Pokemon Go

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
On my Apple Watch though

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
Is that I don't have to have my phone out

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
You know just walk around

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
Kossin in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
My computer is over 9 years old

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
Guess that means I should buy an AMD Vega

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
Sure go for it

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
If you can afford it do it

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
Slay mama

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
Like

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
If you're surprised that that's my answer

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
Then maybe you don't understand why I got the phone

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
Enabler, enabler

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
SSG100 Matt says

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
I was gonna ask how fast does Pogo

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
Play on the X

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
I feel like it's the way it's supposed to be

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
I can't help but say X

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
Anyway, Mortal Kombat

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
Mortal Kombat ruined it for me

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
All right fancy ruined it for you

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
You can help it

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
All right anyway

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
So anyway other stuff I've been playing

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
Not just on the new phone

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
I have been playing

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
More Heroes of the Storm

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
Like that is like my online game right now

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
I am still playing a crap ton of Heroes of the Storm

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
I'll play it with you, I love that game

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
I suck at it

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
Like 90% of what I play is AI

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
Just to do my quest

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
But I will say I finally

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
Just like sucked it up

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
And I was like okay I'm getting pretty good with

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
Morales who's a healer character

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
I'm feeling like I got a good energy

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
With her, I got MVP in a game

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
So I was like I'm gonna try a real game with Morales

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
And I did and I went in the real game

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
And we won and

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
The toxic Heroes of the Storm community

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
Even complimented me on my healing

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
So now my ego is like

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
Woo I can do this

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
I'm gonna be a Heroes of the Storm champion

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
Cause I'm the Morales king

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
So now I'm playing more online

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
So yeah

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
I'm playing a little bit more

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
I'll do the quest to kind of screw around

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
With other characters and stuff

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
But then if I'm gonna play a hero I'm really comfortable with

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
I have been doing more quick matches

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
So that's been a little bit of that

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
But I wanna talk about new games I've been playing

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
So I didn't get to talk about them last week

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
So now I can talk about them this week after I've played them more

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
I've been playing Destiny 2 on PC

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
So I bought that

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
And I started playing that when it came out

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
And I gotta tell you guys

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
The game is gorgeous

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
It looks so good

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
Now I'm not able to play 4K's

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
I didn't buy the AMD Vega

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
That I just told Casa to go buy

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
So I have a video card that's a couple years old

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
So I can't play in 4K

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
But I can play in

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
Some resolution that's like 1440

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
So it's a little higher than 1080p

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
Just ever so slightly

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
But like

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
Isn't that like 2K?

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
I think it might be 2K

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
So yeah

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
And just

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
Like the environments in Destiny 2

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
Are a lot more varied than they were in the first game

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
So I just, yeah

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
The game looks awesome

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
But it's fun to play too

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
I'm not usually huge on first person shooters

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
But with Destiny being a little bit more like

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
I don't wanna say RPG-ish

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
But that's kinda how it feels when you have quests

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
And the fact that people can drop in and out

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
Like your buddy Crystal

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
Has been playing matches with me on PC

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
And Crystal will join matches

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
And we'll just go do stuff

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
And then it's like, okay we did a quest

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
I gotta go

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
I like that whole drop in and out

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
That you can help other people type of thing

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
That's really cool

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
And then my buddy Delvin, shout out Video Game Realness

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
My pal over there who hosts that show

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
He was playing with me on some matches as well

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
And we were both swooning over Sniper Daddy

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
So there it is

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
So Destiny, I'm

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
Liking way more than I thought I would

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
And again the visuals

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
At least on PC

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
I haven't been playing it on console so I couldn't tell you how it compares

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
But it looks

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
So good on PC

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
But again you wanna make sure you have a video card

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
That can at least handle it

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
But mine's a couple years old and is doing okay

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
And if you're gonna be that guy that goes get that brand new AMD card

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
Then hey, I bet 4K is gonna look gorgeous

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
So there you go

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
Dungeon Buster in Chat says

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
I've heard a lot of good things about Destiny 2's

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
Optimization from PC people

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
Yeah, there's no frame rate cap

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
So

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
I probably could play on 4K

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
But my frame rate would be like 20

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
So by dipping it down a little bit

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
I'm able to have a really smooth experience

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
And I really really like it

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
So JD says

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
Sniper Daddy, yes

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
I don't wanna give too many spoileries away

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
But in the first area

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
The guy that you kinda turn Quest into

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
Is a Sniper Daddy

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
And he's voiced by, here's the thing

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
He's voiced by Gideon Emery

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
Who

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
Balthier, Fenris

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
Yeah, Fenris

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
And the thing is that Gideon Emery

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
Never changes his voice

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
For the characters, but there's a reason for that

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
Everybody is just fine with the voice

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
That God gave him

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
So there's that

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
Just give me a character name so I can Google fan art

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
I don't remember the character's name

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
I've been calling him nothing but Sniper Daddy

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
Somebody in chat knows

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
The name

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
Help JD and I out

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
I don't remember the name of the character

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
That's kind of embarrassing

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
One other game that I've been playing

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
An awful lot of is

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
Not as much as some of my friends

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
Cause I haven't beat it yet

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
But I feel like I'm getting really close

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
Super Mario Odyssey on the Nintendo Switch

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
I bought that game when it came out

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
And I've been playing quite a bit of Super Mario Odyssey

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
And you guys, I love it

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
It's just like

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
If you don't like Super Mario Odyssey

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
I would really want to know the why

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
Because I just feel like

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
There's just so much fun

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
And Super Mario Odyssey

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
Just makes me smile

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
Now I don't want to spoil too bad

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
But there was one part in the game in particular

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
Like everybody knows from the trailers

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
New Donk City, right?

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
So those that have played the game will know

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
That there's a certain moment in the new Donk City

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
When you're playing it

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
A celebration of sorts

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
And everybody that's played the game is going to know what I'm talking about here

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
So like when I was going through that whole sequence

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
I was like

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
This is just

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
This is fucking awesome

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
Like there's just

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
This is how playing video games should feel

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
All the time, every time

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
This is a fucking delight

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
What I'm doing right now

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
And I wish every video game felt like this

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
And that's where I'm at with Super Mario Odyssey

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
Are there small nitpicky imperfections

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
I could maybe get into about the game?

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
Sure, it looks a little

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
I think it looks cheaper when it's off the dock

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
Than it does in the dock

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
Like I noticed some of the problems and some of the frame rate issue

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
But honestly, it's so fucking minor

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
It doesn't matter because the game

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
Is extraordinarily fucking fun

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
And that is like

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
I just love that when I go into a new level

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
Like all of a sudden there'll be some

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
Dippy new mini game that's so adorable

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
That I'll have to play

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
Like I just went to Snow World

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
And the only racing thing you have to do

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
Is these fat little walruses

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
That you have to like bounce

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
Because you're a fat fucking walrus

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
And you have to bounce around

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
It's so adorable

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
You do like your test cars

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
I do

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
Mario Odyssey kind of has their version of that

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
And it's super adorable

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
Dark Tetsuya in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
Like Breath of the Wild did

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
For the Zelda games

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
Yeah, actually Mario Odyssey

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
Is a lot like Breath of the Wild

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
In some ways

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
Not totally, I mean there's a little more structure to it

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
You go from zone to zone

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
But like the freedom to do whatever you want

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
In those zones

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
Or let's look behind this wall

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
Because there might be a moon

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
It's just like Mario 64

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
It is, and honestly it's the most Mario 64

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
It's probably the best Mario game since Mario 64

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
And I even thought

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
At the time Mario 64

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
Was kind of overrated

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
And that's because I had a very hard time

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
Shifting from 3D to 2D

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
And I think a lot of gamers of a certain age

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
Kind of went through this

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
So Mario 3D was a little harder for me to get into at the time

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
And believe me guys

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
I loved Mario Sunshine

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
I loved Mario Galaxy

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
I think Mario Galaxy was my game of the year

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
The year that game came out

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
Odyssey is even better

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
Like this is Mario at the top of his game

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
And I couldn't be happier

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
If you own a Switch

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
You're getting this game done

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
Like there's no, is there a debate

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
Why would you own a Switch

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
And not own Mario Odyssey

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
I just, I don't know

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
You would have to hate platformers

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
Or really only be into it for a certain game or something

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
But just like

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
If you even remotely enjoy Mario games

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
Mario Odyssey is fucking great

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
And I would say

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
Go for it

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
So orange right in chat says

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
My entire gaming week was Mario Odyssey

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
Are there bushes to hide in in the desert?

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
Well that was a question

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
For Dungeon Buster

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
I guess about, oh, hiding

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
Being Assassin's Creed-ing across Egypt

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
There are some different kind of

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
Mechanics where you can kind of hide in things

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
And parts where 3D turns

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
Into 2D and it's really cool

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
And guess what I got today

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
In the mail that I'm really excited to play

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
Well in the mail, UPS from Amazon

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
I got my Princess Peach wedding emoji

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
So you know what that means guys

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
Mario wedding dress time

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
Woohoo

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
Dark Sakura

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
It's like rolling her eyes

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
Mario drag

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
Have you seen the pictures of Mario

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
It's just like

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
How can you hate it

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
It's so funny

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
Like cute

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
It's just great

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
Those pictures of Mario in a wedding dress

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
Running away from a Goomba

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
It's everything that Mario Odyssey

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
I love it

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
Alright

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
Anyway, Dungeon Buster in chat says

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
I own a Switch but don't have Odyssey

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
Yet, well yeah

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
But it's on your agenda

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
Like obviously there's gonna be people that are like

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
I don't have the finances for 60 bucks right now

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
But I will by the holidays

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
It's on everybody's radar for sure

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
So there you go

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
Alright

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
So yeah, Mario Odyssey

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
My highest recommendation of that game

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
I'm loving it

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
I've had a very good gaming week

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
These are all good games that I'm talking about

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
Heroes of the Storm, Destiny 2

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
It's a great fucking time to be a gamer

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
Housekeeping

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
I already mentioned we won't be here next week

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
That's a pre-planned night off

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
Sorry about that

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
Follow us on Twitter

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
You can also do Facebook

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
And Discord

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
So I'll tell you this now

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
Stay tuned tonight

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
I thought what a nice apology

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
would be tonight

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
Let's do something, and I looked, do you know it's been over

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
a year since we've done this on our show

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
We're gonna bring back a segment

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
that I know you guys love

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
We're gonna have ourselves a list list tonight

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
So stay tuned

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
List list coming up in part B

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
I'll tell you the topic later

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
But it has to do with one of our news stories tonight

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
So I think we need to get into the news

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
So we can get to the list list topic

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
Right, Loki? Let's get into

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
the news

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
So let's talk a little bit about it on Paris

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
Games Week

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
So they have that big

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
I don't know if you call it a press conference

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
trailer sizzle reel I guess

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
Where they showed off a bunch of new things

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
from Sony

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
One of the big IPs they were showing off

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
was actually a game called

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
Ghosts of Tsushima

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
Which is a brand new game

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
from Sucker Punch

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
And it kind of looks like

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
a Ninja Gaiden just based off the

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
small bit of gameplay that they had

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
But it basically takes place in feudal

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
Japan with

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
Samurais

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
So it looks pretty cool

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
So that's something I'm definitely wanting to check out

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
whenever that comes out

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
They also showed off

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
some other stuff including

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
Let's see

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
They had this game called Erica

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
Which is gonna be using that

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
The

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
PlayStation integration, the play link

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
with your phone

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
So basically you can kind of

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
pick, it almost looks like a choose

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
your own adventure type thing

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
Where she's trying to figure out some sort of mystery

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
that's going on, try to piece together

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
like a puzzle or something

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
Kind of have that quantum

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
or not quantum break, the

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
quadratic dream

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
type look to it

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
but you know, live action and everything

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
Interesting

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
I guess, I don't know, not my type of game

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
but it is a neat

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
neat idea to use the phones and everything

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Plus I guess one of the gimmicks of it

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
is you're gonna be able to draw in the world

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
or touch the world, they said

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
So it's gonna be using your touch screen

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Touch the world

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
This game actually looked pretty awesome

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
I feel like that should be a commercial

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
that airs during the Jerry Springer

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
show

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Pick up the phone, touch

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
my world

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
So there's

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
another game called Onrush

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
which is like this off-road

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
racing kind of

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
cross with like

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
burnout type of game

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
So it's a very fast paced, you know

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
smashing the cars and stuff like that

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
games gonna be coming out from Ubisoft

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
on the Playstation 4 and it looks pretty awesome

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
so definitely

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
one I'm willing to pick up since

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
I love me some burnout

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
and then

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
one of the things that they also announced

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
that with the new Monster Hunter World

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
you're actually gonna be able to play as Aloy

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
from Horizon Zero Dawn

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
with the Playstation 4 version

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
so that's kind of neat for fans of that

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
of course they also talked about the expansion

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
that they have for that game

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
then they've gotta

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
please buy Monster Hunter World

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
cause our company's in a lot of trouble

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
we need this game to be a success

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
well

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
I guess, yeah

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
and then of course

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
there's some new Playstation VR titles

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
they had one that kind of looked

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
a little bit like a spinoff of the

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
gangster, like a London gangster

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
thing that they had in Playstation World

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
but it's this

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
game called Blood and Truth

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
and I guess it's just

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
you know, kind of throwing you into like

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
some sort of modern

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
like, I don't even really say it's like

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
gangster, more

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
it might even be like a Mission Impossible type thing

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
or something like that

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
so lots of gunplay and stuff

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
and then

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
what else

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
they had another game that was kind of lame looking

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
though that I was not interested in

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
but lots of VR stuff that they were announcing

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
so that was kind of cool

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
and then finally the last thing they had a game called

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Ore

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
and it came out actually

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
that day when they announced it

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
and it kind of resembles like

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
a

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
game company game

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
they couldn't say made by that game

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
company or anything like that but they could say

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
in the style of Journey and

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Flow brings this new adventure

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
and I heard the reviews were only mediocre

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
I didn't play it myself

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
I hear it didn't play that well but it looks similar

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
to that, you know the same kind of art style

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
which I mean

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Journey was

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
hands down like one of the greatest

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
video gaming experiences of the past

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
ten years, like no question

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Journey is up there, so it's

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
like it's no surprise we're seeing

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
games inspired by Journey

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
because it deserves that

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
It did look kind of neat though because it almost

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
reminded me of a shooter almost

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
it seemed like a lot of bullet dodging and stuff like that

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
so there was that, it's about this boy

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
kind of can transform into this dragon

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
like a Chinese dragon

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
so it was neat

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
I don't know, I would just check out the trailer

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
see if something that you might be interested in

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
check them out but

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
that's pretty much the major stuff that they announced

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
during Paris Game Week

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Interesting that they announced a lot here because

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Sony still has PSX

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
coming up in the early December

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
now I thought I saw some tweet

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
and I don't know if this is you know

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
take tweets with a grain of salt

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
but I heard that Sony shifted

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
some of what they were going to announce at PSX

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
to this

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
so some people are saying lower your expectations

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
for PSX but that

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
seems strange

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
the stuff that we kind of mentioned

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
was just the new stuff but they also had

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
more trailers for different

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
games that have already been announced

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
like God of War had a gameplay trailer

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
they looked alright, they showed

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
the redone intro for

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Shadow of the Colossus

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
that remake

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
which looked pretty gorgeous

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
so do you think PSX is going to focus on

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
here's an update on Final Fantasy 7 remake

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
well they have that

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
they have that other zombie game that's supposed to be

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
coming up that they kind of showed a little bit of

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
before

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
there's still they can do another

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
I think they showed the Last of Us 2

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
trailer as well

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
so they could always do more of that

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
they could show hopefully

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
I'm hoping at this point you know especially since

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
you know their chummy

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
and everything we'll see a new Death Stranding

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
trailer so

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
yeah so maybe I guess you're right all those things they could

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
kind of quote unquote get away with

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
honestly the PSX

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
conference could be three minutes

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
long and a win and all they have

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
to do is come out and say well we know

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
you've been asking for it so we finally

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
changed our mind of backwards compatibility

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
PS1, 2 and 3 games available

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
today have fun like that could be it

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
and everybody would be like fuck yeah PSX

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
was the best year ever

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
old shit is new again

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
they're never going to do that though they're not going to do that until they're in

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
second place it's just frustrating when you're watching

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
like Microsoft over here going

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
we're going to take original Xbox games

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
and make them in 4K and like

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
meanwhile Sony's like

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
they're not thinking they're like thinking well PlayStation 4

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
is so fucking strong and everything

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
right this generation

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
but then you look at like when the new consoles

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
come out and you think hmm you know the PlayStation

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
4 didn't really have all that mod support

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
that I liked that the other one had oh hey

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
you know what those exclusives weren't so great

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
that was it you know

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
those games that I was really like banking

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
on that were going to be really great games maybe

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
I will go back over there and you know

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
do Microsoft instead and that's kind of where

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
it was like this time around because

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
I don't know PlayStation 4 looked like

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
it had some really great exclusives but then some of

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
those games just turn out to be kind of garbage

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
well yeah SSU100Matt in chat says yeah

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
I'm not expecting any blockbuster stuff from PSX

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
show but they like well you

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
you mentioned that Loki Street Fighter

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
5 was a PSX announcement

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
now at the time that was a pretty

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
fucking big deal now obviously the game came

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
out and it's

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
controversial we'll leave it at that they're

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
trying to salvage what they can with that

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
but at the time still the fact that

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Street Fighter 5 was coming and it's

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
PlayStation and PC only

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
and not none for you

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Xbox go home that was a pretty big

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
deal that's the thing about those both those conferences

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
and stuff and like especially these major game

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
announcements are like this console and

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
PC exclusives like fuck yeah

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
I'm a winner on PC woo I can get all of

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
this you know that's kind

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
of like what that's that was that was

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
me Microsoft E3 yeah exactly

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
it's really kind of the big thing that's kind of

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
kept me away from an Xbox one because

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
I don't feel that I need to have a system

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
for these games like man I

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
really want to play Forza wait I have a PC

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
that can run that and they have it on PC

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
so I don't need the buyer console

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
but yeah I you know hope that there's

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
other games that'd be worthwhile but

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
there really is not a lot of

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
exclusives that's why I kind of been just like eh

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
I'm not really jumping in you know

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
to getting multiple consoles right now of course

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
a Switch later because Nintendo's never gonna put stuff

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
on PC although they do

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
be fucking awesome come on

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
emulators eventually

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
well anyway

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
yeah I'm gonna temper my expectations

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
for PSX but I still

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
there'll be a surprise or two there's gonna

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
be some big game they're gonna unveil to get

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
the fans hyped because this is their chance

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
to get things in front of the fans I don't think it's out

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
of the question that maybe we'll get something

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
playable

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
for Final Fantasy 7 remake

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
or for Kingdom Hearts 3

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
like something out of the Square Enix camp

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Kingdom Hearts 3 has got to fucking

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
come out at some point right?

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
yeah I'm like these games are supposed to be coming out

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
some day

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
like I

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
one of those games has to come out 2018

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Crackdown's gotta come out some

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
day I know it's not

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Sony but Jesus Christ man

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
that was gonna be the game that was gonna

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
sell me on that console and now I'm like

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
eh I would think Final Fantasy

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
remake part 1 is coming 2018

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
like because again they split that game

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
into parts and we've already seen

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
the trailers that show that game in motion

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
in Midgar

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
you know some of the opening scenes was like

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
and that was a year ago so

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
I would think we're closer than

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
I mean again

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
I'm not gonna get my hopes that high up

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
but I would think Final Fantasy 7 remake part 1

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
is close

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
I still have to play through 15

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
15 was a game I was really excited for

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
well if you play 15 that's gonna be the same engine

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
that Final Fantasy 7 remake is running in

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
so you'll get an idea what to expect

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
alright

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
S.H.O.N. and Matt in chat says to be clear

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
I'm not expecting any sort of Kingdom Hearts 3

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Shenmue or Final Fantasy 7

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
remake news alright that's

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
don't go in expecting

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
any of that that way if it does show up

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
you'll be pleasantly surprised

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
all C-Man

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
go expecting

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
nothing but C-Man

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
one publisher

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
that won't be showing up at a Nintendo conference

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
anytime soon likely is EA

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
cause EA has mentioned this week

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
you know we're not really in a rush

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
to make more video games for the Nintendo

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
Switch you might remember that EA

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
kind of has tested the Nintendo Switch

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
with FIFA 18 being out there

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
on the platform I would assume

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
this game's doing alright but in a

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
recent I guess this was an interview

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
with the Wall Street Journal since we are talking about

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
finances the finance chief

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Blake Jorgensen said

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
that basically

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
they want to wait

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
for the Switch to be on the market a full

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
year before deciding whether

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
to release more games besides

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
just FIFA 18

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
they want to wait to quote

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
fully understand what the demand is

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
for Switch before committing more

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
resources to it

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
it's just cost versus return

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
on creating another engine because

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Frostbite doesn't run on it that's really what it

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
comes down to and I'm guessing that they probably just

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
converted because I still think

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
that they have legacy versions coming out

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 still

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
for FIFA it's one of the few games that they

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
have that still because in certain regions

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
they don't have the newer systems or they're

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
not readily available so that's probably why

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
they converted FIFA is because they have

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
the older engine that they're adapting to

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
it but they're not going to

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
that's why they're waiting it's got to be a

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
runaway success before they want to sink money

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
into it I'm going to tell you what it is cause

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
my husband hit the nail on the head with this

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
first thing out of his mouth he said

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
oh this is because Nintendo is challenged

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
when it comes to online

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
and EA wants that sweet loot box

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
money that's and I was like

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
you're right you're absolutely right

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
Nintendo still hasn't unveiled

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
what their full plan for online is

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
that's what's holding EA back

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
I don't think so I think they could still implement

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
loot boxes if they wanted to they have

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
does FIFA 18 have loot boxes? yes

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
they've got the ready

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
they've got the

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
what do they call it?

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
it's like the team thing that they have

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
they've had those loot boxes for FIFA for a long time

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
the player cards or whatever they call them

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
I forget the something team

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
I don't remember what it's called

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
well that's been around forever that's why everybody got their accounts on their Xbox 360

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
or something like that yeah

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
so it's been around forever so they've had

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
they had loot boxes and that type of stuff

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
for the longest time

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
JD in chat says

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
to be honest if EA had any sense

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
they would port Bejeweled to

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Switch yeah I mean

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
EA has that PopCap kind of casual

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
arm is PopCap still open or did

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
EA close it? I think they closed it

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
fuck EA if they did that but I remember

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
PopCap did a lot more of those

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
no because they're still making Plants vs. Zombies

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
and Pagle games

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
I think they're still around but

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
they're not kind of what they used to be

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
under EA which you know

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
but anyway

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
but still I mean

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
you would think that those types of more

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
casual games would do very

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
well on something like Switch

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
oh by the way in a related

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
update the Nintendo Switch

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
has sold 7.6

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
million units

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
doomed for failure

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
total failure

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
7.6 million Switch units

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
as of September 2017

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
already more than half the

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
sales of the Wii U in its

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
entire lifetime

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
this includes 4.7

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
million Zelda Breath of the Wild

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
4.4 Mario Kart 8

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
3.6

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Splatoon 2

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
and speaking of

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
sales Super Mario

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
Odyssey 2

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
million copies in 3 days

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
that's per Nintendo's estimate

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
that includes bundles

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
digital sales but

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
still 2 million copies in 3 days

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
there ain't a lot of games pushing

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
numbers like that so it does

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
put an interesting sort of

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
when you put that next to EA's

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
we're gonna wait and see how the Switch does

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
uh ya boners

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
the Switch is doing just fine

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
if you would just figure

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
out what you are gonna put on this system

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
EA doesn't make games like Mario

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Odyssey they don't make good

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
games like that anymore

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
honestly

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
if

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
well no cause they'd have to convert

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
the engine so I guess there's no

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
Mass Effect to be had on it

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
what about the original trilogy that could

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
happen you know because there's been tweets

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
out there the N7 day is next

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
week right so and I guess it's the

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
it's 10 years of Mass Effect this year

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
and EA I'm still mad I know

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
well here's my punchline EA put out

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
a tweet that said come join us to celebrate

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
10 years of Mass Effect on November 7

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
so what if they show another

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
trailer for Anthem that day

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
I am gonna riot

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
my reply was

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
if it's not Cory and Arc DLC which we know

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
it's not cause they're putting it on a book

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
or a remaster of the trilogy

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
go party by yourself which is my nice way

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
of saying go fuck yourself

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
after what you did to that franchise

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
so if you're not gonna invest like

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
at least if you're gonna say

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Andromeda done fucked it all up

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
if you're not gonna at least then go back and do

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
the trilogy and remaster that

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
and put that out you know which

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
could hypothetically be on the Switch

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
then you know what

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
that's a party I ain't going to

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
have fun

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
anyhow let's move on to happier news

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Dark Sakura what do you have for us

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
well

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
you know I love my Animal Crossing

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
and I'm looking forward to Animal Crossing Pocket Camp

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
even though I am not going to

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
you know be an idiot and make an

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Australian account just to play it early

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
when I'm going to have it

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
soon anyway

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
but anyway

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
of course it's already

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
been data mined for information

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
put up by CriticalGG

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
and

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
there are

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
I mean it's interesting but not surprising

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
so as a

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
campsite manager you will be able to grow your

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
own plants in the garden

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
and you have to water them

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
I mean that's just mainstays

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
of Animal Crossing

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
really

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
but then you also like buy fertilizer

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
which if I remember correctly came

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
up in New Leaf

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
and then you have

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
soil states normal to dry

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
to withered

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
your other

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
animals can hang out in your gardens

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
and then there's like plant breeding which again

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
they also had with the different you know

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
colors of roses and other

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
plants in New Leaf

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
and then you also

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
are going to have like winter themed locations

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
different things for different seasons

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
different facilities

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
like a school, a shop, a hospital

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
restaurant, office and hotel

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
and that's like more of the stuff from

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
New Leaf so this is really

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
just like it seems to me

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
just like normal

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
Animal Crossing but

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
updated for

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
mobile

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
and of course it doesn't necessarily mean that these

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
items are going to be

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
implemented in the game

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
but the thing that's interesting is that there's costumes

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
that are found which again there were costumes

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
in New Leaf and other Animal

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
Crossing games but it includes Mario

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
Link and Samus

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
so you can get those

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
assets already existed in the other Animal Crossing

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
games I just think it's cool that

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
this is really going to look like it's more

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
like an actual Animal

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Crossing so I'm pretty happy

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
I got to admit

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
like I don't know what it is I don't know if it's just because

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
Animal Crossing has not

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
been about collecting virtual console

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
games since the original GameCube release

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
but I'm having a hard time getting

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
excited about it I mean

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
of course I'm going to download it because

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
it's free and of course I'm going to try it

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
and play it and who knows maybe I'll have a good time

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
but like when I watched the

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Nintendo Direct at the end of it I was just

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
kind of meh

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
oh yeah

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
how about something really

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
truly different for Animal Crossing I mean

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
granted they're going to save that for the Switch

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
probably, hopefully, but I just

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
I wasn't that excited

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
I don't know

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
I'm going to play it and I want one for Switch

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
I love my Animal Crossing

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
that's cool

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
with my Switch I can take it to work

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
and play it during my lunch

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
SSJ100Matt says in chat

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
my girlfriend is all over this Animal Crossing mobile game

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
which means I will have to be but I'm like Rob

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
I'm not really feeling it after watching the Direct

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
Kaijuto though says Animal Crossing

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
is fun times and JD saying

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
I'm looking forward to the Animal Crossing game

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
it's like the Funko dolls

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
I'm not going to knock you for spending money on

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Animal Crossing have fun with it

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
I like Animal Crossing

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
but for me it's a little

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
stale so maybe

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
the change in setting or maybe some of this other

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
stuff maybe it will make the mobile version

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
more interesting but I'm just

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
I'm not really excited about it

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
although I did have a laugh

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
at the whole Tom Nook on the Cash Money Store

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
because there was a picture

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
like there's pictures of Tom Nook

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
selling the different amounts and the highest

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
amount of like the paper tickets you can buy

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
is like 50 bucks and it shows

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
a picture of Tom Nook swimming in a

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
bathtub full of money and that

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
cracked me up so at least I was like

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
well at least there's a sense of humor about

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
what a disgusting amount of money Nintendo

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
stands to make off this game

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
I like that his icon is one you can have

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
on your Switch

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
oh yeah that's right it is huh

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
I have a little version of my Mii

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
I think doing a little pose

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
that's like hey

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
I want to try my amiibos on it

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
now all my Animal Crossing ones and see if

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
any of them bring anything up

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
in certain games

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
I'm talking about on the actual system

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
where you can use it to make your avatar

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
I don't think the system will do no the system won't do anything

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
but the games will like you can use

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
any amiibo in Breath of the Wild

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
only Zelda related ones do

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
very specific things but the other

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
amiibos will give you coins, random items

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
and Mario Odyssey is a very

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
similar thing like every amiibo

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
will give you something but only certain

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
ones like Bridal Peach will give you

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
something like very specific I wonder if the

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
Tom Nook one will take your money

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
it might or if the Resetti one will actually

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
yell at you that would be

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
cool alright

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
let's move on with some more stories

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
Loki another big event this past weekend

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
right yes I forgot that BlizzCon was even

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
this weekend but apparently there is

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
lots of announcements from that oh you don't

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
follow the same people I do on Twitter I

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
couldn't avoid it but it's

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
you know what I had a lot of fun when I went in

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
2014 I would love I was

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
a little pissy that Diablo

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
was nowhere to be found and

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
they said it was gonna really not be

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
a BlizzCon I was a little pissy about that but

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
you know I was still

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
I was still living vicariously for my friends

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
who were there it's really about the community

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
at these meetups so

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
they did announce that their

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
Overwatch is getting another hero

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
so they have Moira

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
and or Moira

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
I guess Moira

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Moira I believe is correct

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
okay she is

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
a healer and

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
I guess from

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
of course Blackwatch

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
and then they also

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
showed off a new

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
map as well which is kind of neat

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
it's like Blizzard World which I guess

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
is a tribute to different Blizzard games

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
it's like Disneyland

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
it's that China theme park that

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
ripped it all off that was when I was first looking

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
I was like oh they got the last laugh on that

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
didn't they remember the stories about the China

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
theme park that they built around World of Warcraft

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
and shit like that's what it is

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
so I had a good laugh about

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
that I'll just quickly say

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
with the Moira thing too

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
she was completely unexpected because they

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
haven't really dropped any hints about who the character

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
would be so

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
Moira kind of came out of nowhere

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
so to speak but they also showed

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
during one of the development panels which I thought was really interesting

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
they showed a ton

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
of concept art for like all

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
these different characters

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
yeah I thought there was a jet pack cat or something

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
there was an

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
it's an illusion to an old

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
kung fu movie but there was an old

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Asian lady with curlers in her hair smoking

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
a cigarette oh yeah from kung fu

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
hustle is that yeah there was a character

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
in Overwatch that looked like that old lady

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
that was awesome

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
that would have been fucking rad

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
jet pack cat in there

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
yeah jet pack cat would be awesome but who knows

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
maybe some of these characters will come out

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
in the future who knows

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
especially if they get good feedback on it because remember the whole

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
Pandarian thing remember that was a big old

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
April Fools joke thing and then all of a sudden

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
that's true

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
this expansion you know because people were fans of it

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
that's true

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
so that was kind of neat and then

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
in non-Overwatch news of course

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
this was something that they've

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
alluded to in the past with shutting down

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
those servers but

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
World of Warcraft classic is finally

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
announced which is going to be basically

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
the vanilla World of Warcraft

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
before you know they added

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
all the expansions ugh all those people are welcome

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
I don't miss having to elementally

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
do my weapons

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
or training with my weapon

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
I don't miss that shit

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
they can have it I know everybody that's like

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
back in the day World of Warcraft actually

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
used to be hard you know when they first

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
announced the news I was like why the fuck did

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
Blizzard give in to those people why did they give them those

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
people they're going to do all this work

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
building those servers then people are going to be like

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
oh yeah this game sucks

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
what's it's fuck outside Orgrimmar

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
were it was like

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
they divided it into two areas now

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
I've come around on my

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
perspective if that's

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
go build the classic zone

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
get those fucking people out

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
of the game all those people that are like

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
back in my day fine go

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
be here go have fun go have fun

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
in your playground that is not

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
going to be as good as you remember

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
have a blast going to level 40 to get your

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
mount have a great time

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
maybe I'll come back to wow who knows

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
but I wasn't really feeling

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
the rest of the news that they announced Loki

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
yeah so um

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
yeah along with that of course

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
they did announce that if you are

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
you know like most people that do

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
enjoy the expansions they have another

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
expansion coming so they have

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
a horde versus alliance expansion

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
called the battle for

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
Azeroth which has a new

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
continent uh Zandalar

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
and new dungeon raids

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
and uncharted

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
islands and

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
I guess um you also have

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
uh you know basically

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
um supporting

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
the you know different alliances

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
in this alliance versus horde war

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
how long

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
have people been talking about having

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
the Zandalar stuff like

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
since vanilla at least

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Lich King when that was really front and center

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
in one particular zone there right

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
so why are they announcing

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
this shit after I've decided to move on

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
that's why they're doing it but I

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
gotta say my I was not

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
I didn't

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
again I was kind of meh at the expansion

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
news I wasn't really feeling it like when they were talking

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
this whole line about we're going back to

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
the war in Warcraft and going back to our roots

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
I'm like you say the same thing every

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
expansion when you introduce

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
Mists of Pandaria you said

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
we're going back to horde versus alliance

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
and we all saw how that turned out

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
so forgive

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
me if I give a little side eye to this whole

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
we're going back to our roots uh huh

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
sure Jan honestly I'm

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
tired of the whole horde versus alliance thing

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
I would rather like have

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
a neutral faction

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
horde an alliance fuck party is that

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
something you'd play it'll be called

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
the whoreliance

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
and then

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
finally last but not least they

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
said that Starcraft 2 is going free to play

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
so you can actually

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
on November 14th it will download

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
Wings of Liberty

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
the campaign without paying anything

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
and you get access to both single and

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
multiplayer for free

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
that's a pretty big deal for a lot of

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
people that Starcraft will be free but it

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
sounds like it's free but

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
it sounds kinda limited

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
it sounds like you have to buy the expansions if you want

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
those they're just not selling the base game anymore and then

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
apparently if you just have Wings of Liberty

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
they'll also give you the first expansion

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
that's me I only have

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
Wings of Liberty but never really play the game after that

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
so you'll get that at least

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
so that's cool I guess if you want to

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
try it out and of course they have the

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
Starcraft

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
remaster that you can check that out too so

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
that's also free

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
you did miss the news for the current Blizzard game I'm all

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
about which is Heroes of the Storm

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
oh yeah so they have more Overwatch characters

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
coming to it? Just one Hanzo

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
which is like the worst Overwatch

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
character I'm sorry but people are gonna disagree

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
with me on that but

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
actually he makes

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
as much as I kinda give him shit in Overwatch

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
he makes a lot of sense for Heroes of the Storm

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
like his abilities especially the dragon

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
thing for a lane game are gonna be great

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
so alright whatever and then Alex

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
Straza looks pretty cool I guess but you know

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
here's the thing with

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
all that Blizzard kind of announces

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
new heroes throughout the year all

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
the time like we just got

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
within the past six weeks

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Ana and Junkrat from Overwatch

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
so the whole reveal

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
of Hanzo and Alex Straza

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
at Blizzcon didn't feel

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
exactly like oooh

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
you know so it's like oh okay this is

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
the next months and they're just doing it on stage at

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
Blizzcon so oh

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
and there's another game Hearthstone

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
they have a new expansion too

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
something about the Hoggers and a silly

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
little theme song that goes with it because there's always

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
some silly little theme song that goes with it

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
so but I don't play a lot of Hearthstone

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
sorry guys but I know some people are super into that

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
so your requisite

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
Blizzcon announcement of a Hearthstone

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
expansion did indeed occur done

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
alright

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
going to chat

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
over at live.vognetwork.com

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
SHO100Matt says wow Hanzo

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
shade you know what

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
let's see Ragenator says if Hanzo was in a valley

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
would he be Hanzo low

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
and shoot first?

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
oh god

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
yes he would

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
no no no because

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
I quit I'm done with this show

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
I quit here's my letter of resignation

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
no no no no Han didn't shoot first

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
Han shot only

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
alright

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
but Han's taking medication to fix that

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
problem so

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
moving on just for that

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
next story oh it's my story god dammit

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
alright

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
just for that we're doing sad

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
news first off for sad news

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
and actually I don't mean to make light of this because

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
this news really does suck runic

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
games has been closed if you don't know them

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
by name you probably know the games they made

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
does EA own them? no

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
actually perfect world owns runic

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
games does EA own them? no

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
torchlight and torchlight 2

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
were the big games that runic made which

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
coming off this news of no diablo

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
news we've seen these other games that

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
kind of come in and you know pick up the slack

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
what was it Grim Dawn's another one that's

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
pretty good I mean that's not runic but you know there's

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
other like diablo clones out there

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
oh path of exiles the other

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
huge one right but anyway sadly

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
torchlight which was pretty good I

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
really enjoyed it runic games has been

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
closed that fucking sucks

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
they also were making a MOBA

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
called gigantic but

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
sadly they have closed

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
runic games which was located in

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
Seattle perfect world

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
in a statement said that that gigantic

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
will quote continue to be available on all

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
our platforms and runic will

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
remain a part of perfect world entertainment's portfolio

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
of studios

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
they also went to say for those

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
that love the torchlight series

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
there will be some news coming that's from

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
runic studio head Marsh Leffler

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
and for all our fans our

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
community and multiplayer services will keep running

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
even after the studio's lights go off

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
you haven't heard the last of us

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
so it makes me think that another developer

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
will be taking the reins for torchlight 3

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
or whatever is next in torchlight's

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
future but sadly a moment

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
of silence for our pals at runic games

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
that's not fun news to talk about

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
also not fun to talk about is

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
house mark apparently says

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
they're no longer going to make arcade games

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
and that means like arcade style games

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
this was in a blog

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
from CEO Larry

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
Quintonen sorry

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
I'm totally mispronouncing that but in this open

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
letter said despite critical success

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
and numerous awards our games just

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
haven't sold in significant numbers

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
are they the ones that did super stardust or something?

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
they are the ones that did super stardust as

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
well as rezogun which were huge

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
titles here's the thing

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
I was like wait a minute didn't house mark

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
have a game that I really wanted to play coming out

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
they did it's next

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
Mashina was the other

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
game that they were doing

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
and actually did you

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
know that next Mashina came out

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
that was that game they showed at E3 that was

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
the big trailer they had with it

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
and Eugene Jarvis was a part

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
of this game which is a pretty big deal he was

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
back in the day was he Robotron

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
Defender, Defender was the game that Eugene

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Jarvis did so

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
it was a big deal that he was partnering up

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
that game came out over the summer

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
I had no

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
idea and I wanted to play that game

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
so

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
I need to go back on my Playstation 4 and

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
get it but can I just say that

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
like you know now granted look

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
this podcast thing is a

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
hobby Twitter isn't everything

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
although it's a lot but I'm just saying like

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
I really liked what I saw at E3

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
I had no

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
idea this game came out already

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
I think

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
that should say something about why the game wasn't selling

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
did

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
you guys know that it came out because

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
I missed it it's also to the Sony

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
storefront that they have their Playstation

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
stores kind of crap I would

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
I would agree with that it's time for it to evolve

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
it needs an evolution it needs a fresh coat of

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
paint I'll give you that

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
because there will be games that I know

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
like are coming out like for example there was

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
that Megaton Rainfall game

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
that I was looking forward to

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
and it was supposed to come out on a certain day

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
and it was like only a couple days away from it and it wasn't on the storefront

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
anywhere I was like okay well shit you know I was

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
gonna market for download or pre-purchase or something

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
like that and it wasn't there and all of a sudden like

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
oh yeah it's up now and it's like

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
okay well there's the store page but like

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
all these other games have like coming soon pages

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
and everything where's all this shit

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
well now and I do want to clarify Housemark

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
hasn't announced that they're closing they're just

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
announcing that they're making different games

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
now so that's fine I mean well that's

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
fine if a company wants to branch out and do different games but

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
honestly the shocking part

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
of that story honest to god for me and maybe

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
I was just in the dark or playing something else

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
the most shocking part of that story was that that game came out

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
and I had no idea

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
oops I guess I'm part of the problem

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
Kaijuto said it was

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
all over the PSVR store page it was a

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
PSVR game?

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
I had no idea

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
it was a VR game?

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
I didn't know that

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
I figured since they kept talking about

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
Robotron and name checking Eugene Jarvis

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
I figured it was kind of like a modern version of Robotron

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
with some awesome Tron

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
looking music and stages and stuff

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
that's and I was here for that so

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
I had no idea it was a VR game

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
oh boy

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
alright well good luck to Housemark

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
with their future development and

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
promotion of the things that they put out

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
that's for sure so

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
anyway and Dark Tetsuya confirming

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
yeah it is oh I mean it's like

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
Robotron alright well Dark Tetsuya

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
Dark Tetsuya figured out that that

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
game came out I somehow missed that

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
sorry about that oops I killed

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
that franchise sorry guys

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
Dark Sakura what do you have for us?

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
treasure

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
buried treasure? no my favorite

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
no treasure like Radiant Silver Gun

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
and Ikaruga well that's pretty cool too

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
Gunstar Heroes

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
so there was a rumor

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
that treasure was going to stop making new

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
games but

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
no

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
the last new game that they

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
did was Geist Crusher God that came out in

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
2014

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
anyway

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
the rumor was that

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
they were going to go as an IP holding company

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
but their president

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
Mayagawa Masato said

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
that they have an announcement

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
coming out in 2018 and

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
that treasure is not going to make social

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
games as long as he lives

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
the quote I'll never work on

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
social games for as long as I live

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
I'll have something to share next

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
year somebody's taking

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
a stand somebody has had it officially

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
right?

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
but anyway he also

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
was complaining

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
about the lack of communication

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
at Sega when they were working

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
on Mega Drive games especially when they were working

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
on Yu Yu Hakusho and

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
they said Gunstar Heroes shipped

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
70,000 units in Japan and

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
200,000 abroad and that the

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
the

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
first run of it in

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
Japan ran out really quickly he also wishes

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
that Sega would do a

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
Mega Drive mini like what Nintendo

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
is doing and not licensed out by a third

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
party so that it actually is the right

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
you know

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
hardware to run the games

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
so

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
anyway

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
we've got some things

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
here from Treasure from next year that's going to be pretty

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
exciting I love Treasure

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
would you like a Dreamcast mini

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
or like a... Dude a Dreamcast

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
mini would be rad

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
of course how

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
many you know

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
burned GD-ROMs

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
do we have

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
in existence?

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
how many times how many of us

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
own

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
have a copy of

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
Mario Brothers or Super Mario Brothers

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
and ROMs and stuff everybody does but it doesn't mean

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
they're not going to buy the system

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
I'd buy a Dreamcast mini

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
oh hell yeah I'd buy a Dreamcast mini

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
especially if they put PSO

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
again on it you know I don't know

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
how that would work but I would be here for that

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
who cares this is fantasy world that we're talking

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
fantasy zone

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
I don't think it's in our

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
show role at all but PSO2

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
is getting like some neat skins

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
like I tend to leave

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
that stuff out because it just causes me pain

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
well I mean there's

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
but like they're supposed to be getting

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
um

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
oh god what was it like

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
one of the Shining games

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
skins for that

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
and uh virtual on

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
so that may be enough

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
to make me re-download it

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
alright just a few more stories

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
before we get to the classic system of the month

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
but first Loki

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
yes so Call of Duty World War 2

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
finally came out and

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
there's of course

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
controversy

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
uh well first off

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
you know they have the controversy that

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
for some stupid reason

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
they have Trevor T. Martin

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
actually

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
promoting the game

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
and he was best known

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
for violating

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
Federal Trade Commission regulations

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
by owning a

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
Counter Strike skin gambling

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
site and not

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
disclosing that so

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
he's apparently doing I guess

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
a race of prestige

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
fundraiser type thing

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
I don't know I think it's

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
dumb but all the more reason

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
not to really give a shit about this

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
um one of the big things

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
though that's kind of annoying though and remember

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
we talked about this whole

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
um patent that

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
Activision had done

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
and they said no we're not using this patent

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
in Destiny 2 or whatever about

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
loot boxes and basically

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
finding ways to get people you know

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
oh exposed to loot boxes

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
and you know manipulating people

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
in certain ways guess what

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
Call of Duty World War 2 has

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
it's not in Destiny

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
it's not in Destiny but guess what it has

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
it has fucking loot boxes

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
because I know when people are in

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
World War 2 loot boxes fell from the

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
fucking heavens and you know

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
there's literally like achievements

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
and goals in the game to watch people because

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
when people get there's like a social area

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
first off so the beach of Normandy is a

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
social area so many things are wrong

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
with that in the first place wow

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
so wow there's that

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
and then apparently as

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
you're doing that when you get loot boxes

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
other players can see them drop from

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
the sky and see what cool shit you

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
got as like some sort of

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
subliminal way to say oh maybe you should

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
purchase some fucking loot boxes

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
like a certain patent that a certain company

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
made that said oh don't worry

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
it's not evil we're just thinking

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
about ideas except we're totally gonna do this

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
in the next Call of Duty what you're describing

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
is like a parody

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
of what gaming has become

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
but it's fucking real

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
yes so

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
on top the social zone

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
of the beach of Normandy

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
yes so yeah

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
they have these socializations

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
what other cool things do they have in

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
there as well well apparently

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
you can also

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
uhhhh

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
play Pitfall

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
well I do like Pitfall

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
who doesn't like Pitfall but yes you can play

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
Pitfall 2 even

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
better I love Pitfall 2 I think you actually

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
have to purchase some of these so

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
yeah they have a rest and relaxation thing

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
so they have

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
it's a fucking loot box isn't it you have to purchase

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
them with in game money or whatever

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
but they've got and I don't know

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
if it's per play

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
but apparently you can go to

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
an R&R tent and they have Pitfall 2

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
Grand Prix, Fishing Derby

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
Enduro, Kaboom

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
River Raid

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
okay so all the old 2600 Activision

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
yes all the old Activision

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
games which is all on those

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
Flashback consoles because Flashbacks

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
are on version 8 this year

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
and the big thing that they got was

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
Activision licenses so like all those

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
exact same games you just named are on those

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
Flashback 8 consoles

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
yeah just except

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
I don't think Pitfall 2 is in it but Pitfall 1

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
is

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
so it's just

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
something that they have in this part of this hub

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
now

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
alrighty

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
to register participation for this

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
week's episode of Orange Island Radio at

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
vognetwork.com use the passphrase

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
home

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
so yeah well look I'm all for

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
classic games being available and all this stuff

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
but if they charge you per play

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
that's a little silly I don't think

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
I don't think they're charging probably per play

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
doesn't specifically state that that would be

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
kind of lame because who would do that

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
but they're like you know it

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
doesn't look like it's that much currency it's like

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
10 currency or something like that

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
10 whatever loot

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
I don't know what the fuck they're

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
10 lootie points

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
10 looties

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
are

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
you found the lootie

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
alright and one more story

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
for you before we get to the classic game of the week

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
and it's about the video game

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
Just Dance have you played Just Dance

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
recently? no not for several

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
years it's a

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
a franchise I've kind of fallen out of

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
taking the world by storm

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
well apparently it is I mean they still

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
they're still putting them out

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
Just Dance 2018 is out there

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
yeah because they don't have to update their

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
engine or anything they spit them out

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
every year because they still have it coming out on the original Wii

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
so apparently

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
these games are so popular that

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
it's justifying the existence of

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
Just Dance Live

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
that's right

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
4 places in North America

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
if you are one of the lucky residents of

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
Miami, Chicago

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
Houston or Los Angeles

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
guess what Just Dance Live

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
is coming to your town

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
what is Just Dance Live?

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
I don't fucking know because I can't

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
figure it out from the trailer it looks like

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
it's just a kid friendly

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
rave meaning

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
all the glow sticks and none of the ecstasy

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
I think that's what it is

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
um

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
apparently there will be dancers

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
and by the way Just Dance has like

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
degrees as dancers too

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
you can't actually be playing Just Dance without having

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
like a panda bear like a character

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
doing the dances

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
yeah they said there's characters on stage

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
that you follow they're iconic

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
once again Ubisoft misusing

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
the word iconic

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
Just Dance moves

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
girl that panda dance

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
iconic

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
like I'm sure that like you know the

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
iconic moves of like

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
no

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
any of the moves that they do in the game

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
which is iconic I guess

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
colorful characters dancing live on stage

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
you follow along share the thrill

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
with your friends and family

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
pricing from $45

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
to $99

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
for the VIP experience

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
okay to be fair

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
it does sound to me like this is an event

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
for kids like when I say kid friendly

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
rave like there's a half truth

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
to that so

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
Loki this begs the question

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
take your kids to the Just Dance

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
live first off

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
my kids don't know what Just Dance is

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
um so no

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
I would not do that and I was

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
just curious oh my god

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
fucking hell is wrong with these people

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
are you watching the trailer

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
it's pretty late though I mean they've got

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
like you know

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
8.30 it starts at 8.30

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
there's two shows

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
one is late and one is

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
matinee okay so the matinee

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
whatever but like

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
no no

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
no no no alright for the

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
VIP experience

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
for that $99 you get glow up

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
glasses an exclusive

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
drawstring bag and VIP

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
glow laminate and you get an

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
in-game reward for Just Dance and a meet

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
and greet with the cast after the show

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
although I should point out

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
although it's been in many of her music videos

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
Katy Perry is not going to be there

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
at the Just Dance event in fact

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
no actual

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
recording artist that you know from

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
these games except unless there's like an

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
in-house band or something will not

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
be there so you are meeting

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
people

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
that are just dressed up

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
you're meeting costume

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
characters

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
that

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
it's awfully bold of

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
them to assume

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
that this is so big that

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
I

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
I just can't

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
you can't

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
you can't literally

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
let's put this back okay so they have like dancing

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
with the stars and they do live stage

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
performances of that but that you're watching an

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
actual skilled person that like

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
knows how to ballroom dance and that's like

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
that's actually kind of entertaining because you

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
know what C-list celebrities which are

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
you know so you know what you're going

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
into that but this is like

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
it's just people playing

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
the fucking game basically

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
you're watching them and doing the same

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
shit why would I pay

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
$45 to go to an arena

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
to do that

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
even if I was a kid I could think of

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
way better things I'd spend my money on

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
how about a copy of Just Dance

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
come on Noel Gustin our chat

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
over at live.vognetwork.com says

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
Rob if they had an ABBA themed

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
one you'd be there

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
how dare you drag me and

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
read me so accurately in front of our

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
dozens and dozens of listeners how very

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
would you though would you would you seriously

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
go pay they wouldn't be ABBA

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
singing it would just be pre-recorded ABBA music

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
with some dumbasses on stage

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
dancing to it would you pay

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
$45 to watch

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
people dancing to ABBA

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
well see here's the thing here's the thing

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
like I want to say I want

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
to have my pride I want to

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
say no Loki I would not

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
but the reality is

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
I'm pretty sure there actually is a show

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
in Reno where drag queens

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
do ABBA songs but that's drag queens

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
okay that's some talented people this

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
is fucking

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
did our token straight person

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
here on Orange Lounge Radio just

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
say drag queens are more talented

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
than the Just Dance live crew yes because it's

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
fucking this panda bear that I

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
see on my screen I am the

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
proudest gay I am the proudest

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
seriously like there's this the

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
picture that they have of the Just Dance live

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
interactive experience that's

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
quite a bold statement right there

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
you know they have this

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
and sorry

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
for using this word because they use

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
it quite often but sorry fucking

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
retarded looking panda bear it is

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
the most stupid derpy

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
panda bear I have ever seen

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
and don't get me wrong like

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
this would be different if it was like a

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
character that people know but no one's like

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
oh my god I love panda

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
bear from

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
Just Dance yeah I'm totally dressing up

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
on Halloween as panda bear the well

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
known iconic character

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
nobody does that

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
nobody is that into

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
just it's a casual game the only

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
hardcore into a casual game like this

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
the only Just Dance I care about is Lady Gaga

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
uh JD in chat says

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
uh they also have an Abba Just

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
Dance game yeah I'm aware

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
Dark Sakura may have seen me play that

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
I thought that was Singstar Abba no

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
there's both and I may own both there's

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
there's a Singstar Abba Tiara was here for

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
that yes okay so I'm gonna

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
I don't want to talk

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
you love Just Dance

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
the game and showing stupid

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
people dancing at home now experience

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
dumb asses on

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
stage okay I'll

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
tell you what this is okay think

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
think back really gonna rant about

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
no no no no no hold on hold on think back

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
to the last few

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
E3s okay think back to

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
E3s and think back to the Ubisoft

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
conferences okay what is seriously

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
the best part of every Ubisoft title

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
is it I'm surprised

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
you didn't say it's the Just Dance

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
performances because I know every time I see those

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
Just Dance performances on any of those

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
Ubisoft conferences like holy

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
fuck this is stupid and cringy as

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
shit this is what people are paying

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
money to go see why

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
why would you say that

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
well if they say Aisha Tyler's

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
gonna be there now I haven't said I'll

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
tell you what I'm sure that these people

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
that listen to these songs like the artists

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
that sing these songs how about you put that

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
$25 towards a ticket and actually see the real

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
artist go

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
on stage and perform because that's fucking

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
worth spending money on not watching

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
a bunch of nobodies dance to a

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
song that's why you have Just Dance

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
so you can be a bunch of nobodies dancing to

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
a song you don't need to pay money to

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
go to an event to do that calm down

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
Marissa Congusto our

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
our pal we love her in our chat saying

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
dumb asses on stage was rejected

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
by the marketing team

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
alright

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
look we have got to move on

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
but maybe we'll revisit

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
this topic a little later Wink

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
in the meantime we need to get to

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
a segment we do here on the show quite

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
regularly called the classic

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
game of the week except

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
plot twist dark soccer

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
sometimes like it's really a plot

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
11 months and once

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
a month she does the classic system

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
of the month this is the next to last one

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
it is and it's actually not one

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
that wasn't on our original list you

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
changed it I did

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
because this one's pretty fucking awesome

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
alright well that's alright it's your segment you can do whatever the hell

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
you want it's the classic game of the week

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
or this week the classic system of the month

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
as it was known in

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
Japan the

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
X Rokuman Hasen which just sounds

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
so cool this thing allowed

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
the X68000

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
which is a home computer that was made

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
by Sharp it was first released in

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
1987 only in

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
Japan it had

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
first model of 10 megahertz

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
Motorola 68000 CPU

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
one whole meg of ram

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
and no hard drive

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
the last one that came

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
out which was in 1993 had a

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
25 megahertz Motorola

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
68000

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
30 CPU

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
4 meg of ram

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
and an

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
optional 80 megabyte

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
SCSI hard drive it was so SCSI

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
at any rate

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
this was

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
pretty much the thing to have if

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
you liked your Capcom games

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
basically most of the

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
and also you could expand the ram to

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
12 megabytes but it didn't really

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
need more than two for most of the games

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
so anyway it's

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
operating system was called human

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
86000 which was developed

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
by Sharp and

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
actually developed for Sharp by Hudson

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
soft and we know Hudson was

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
actually really big in bed with

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
with

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
NEC at the time

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
oh a lot of questions

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
were just answered this video just got to a segment

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
from Parodius Da

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
which I know is one of your favorites

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
yeah

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
it had really a lot of great games on it

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
it looks really, he said this is

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
93 as he just ended

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
yeah 87 to 93

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
this looks really good for a system of that time

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
well and I picked just basically

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
you know like some of the top 10

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
or top 30 games for my video on it

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
but it also

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
was like a tall tower

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
it was white because

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
apparently I guess light colored

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
systems do well in Japan

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
maybe anyway

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
it also

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
had

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
it would also function as

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
with a cable ready

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
TV set with composite video input

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
it also

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
could

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
the display that came with it I'm sorry

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
would also work for JAMA

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
arcade boards because it had RGB input

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
and a

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
standard resolution refresh timing

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
so pretty good

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
it used

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
a hard disk interface

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
which was the

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
SASI sassy

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
I want to call it

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
that basically

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
the later versions though went with the

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
which was pretty much a standard

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
for a long time and then I guess

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
it got

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
you know replaced by something better

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
it did not support

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
the vfat file name

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
standard that went with windows systems

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
it had an 18.3

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
character file name instead of the 8.3

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
allowed in the fat system

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
so yeah just some

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
background on it but the thing that made this the best

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
the thing that made this the best is

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
because the

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
2000 had very

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
similar hardware

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
to what arcade machines

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
ran at the time and it also

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
was the Capcom CPS

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
system development machine

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
it had different text

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
it could support separate text ram graphic ram

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
and hardware sprites as well

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
it also had Yamaha's

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
basically best synthesizer at the time

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
and it was

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
the thing I mean basically

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
games that were made

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
for this system were

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
Parodius Da as we saw

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
Ghouls and Ghosts, Strider, Final Fight, Alien

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
Syndrome, Street Fighter 2

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
Dash and

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
actually one of the best Castlevania

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
versions the original

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
Akumajo Dracula

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
that was later on ported

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
to Playstation with Castlevania Chronicles

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
Chorensha 68000

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
which basically was

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
ported to Windows later

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
and it

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
really just allowed for

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
beautiful graphics and

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
I mean arcade perfect sound

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
was amazing on it again

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
everything that the system

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
that basically came out on the system

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
was like having an arcade

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
version in your home

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
it really was the one to have

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
I would love to have one if I could find

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
one I mean

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
it'd be fun to hook

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
that up and play different

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
things you know I think it would be

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
the Legend of the Valkyrie we're looking at

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
is it? I missed the name sorry

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
oh well but anyway

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
just to go over

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
a list of a few more of the games that came out

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
on it a couple of little things

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
that people might

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
might recognize is

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
we had After Burner

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
came out on it Alien Syndrome

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
like I said

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
we had

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
Asuka 120% Burning Festival

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
we had Atomic Robo Kid

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
Battle Chess

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
I fucking love Battle Chess by the way

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
a game called Blodia

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
several Bomberman games

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
Bubble Bobble

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
Chase HQ

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
Columns

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
it's a cotton game

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
Cotton Fantastic Night Dreams

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
this system has your name written all over it

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
it's like all your favorite games

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
I'm really surprised you don't have one of these

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
well they're pretty expensive

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
I mean like I said Daimakemura

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
is Ghost and Goblins

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
Daytona Twinbee

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
several Dragon Knight games

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
I'm just going through the list here

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
you don't have to read the whole list

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
Emerald Dragon came out on this

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
Emerald Dragon which I

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
which is kind of like one of the

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
golden games to have for

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
the PC Engine

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
that came out on this

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
we had Final Fight, Fantasy Zone

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
all the stuff that I fucking love

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
Galaga 98

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
and several of the Garo Densetsu

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
games which was Fatal Fury

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
so

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
hey

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
this is the thing to have

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
yeah so if you

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
have one to give away Dark Sakura would like to talk to you

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
honestly

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
even if you could find one just for a good

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
affordable price I'd be down for it

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
I would give someone else's right

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000
arm for this

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
alright anything else to say about this?

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
no I know this system looks

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
this is like Dark Sakura's like somebody made

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
this just for you if you actually

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
want to see really good comparisons

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
for how well this ran everything

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
in comparison to its

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
uh

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
what's the word, contemporaries

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
look for

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
oh shit Salamander which was Life Force

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000
but look for

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
the channel that does Battle of

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
the Ports and

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
he's really good

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000
I mean a lot of them are played emulated but it

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
really does showcase how

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
great this system is compared

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
to its contemporaries that were out at the time

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
especially like the ZX Spectrum

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
I mean that was just kind of sad

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
but it's worth a shot I mean

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
really really really if

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
on my

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
holy grail of systems to have

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
this would be at the top of it followed by

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
the Mardi or the FM Towns

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
Mardi and then

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
probably after that well I'd still really

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
like a duo RX

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000
so

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
there it is your classic system of the month

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
the Sharp X68000

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
good pick Dark Sakura

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
I didn't really know a lot about that system

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
but it looks really

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
I mean just looking at the video it's looking

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
like arcade versions it would be

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
just it's on my list

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
I would need you underwear for that system

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
alright we're gonna take

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
a break but when we come back we have plenty more show

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000

so we can give you some more show here to hold you

Animal Crossing yes the dark web

of Google yes oh is that all

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
okay yeah you just do a search for

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
Animal Crossing pocket

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000

Animal Crossing

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
there it is

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
I mean it looks nice

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
alright

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
I don't know if I'd play it very

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
long you haven't had enough time

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
to really it looks okay yeah fair

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
enough alright let's get into some rapid

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
fire news Loki

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
alright so um

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000
PlayStation Plus they announced what games are

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000
coming out in November I am sorely

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000
disappointed because I actually own all these

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
uh at least the VR

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000
games um but you get

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000
Worms battleground on PlayStation

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
4 I guess I don't have that bound

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000
which is an alright

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
PlayStation VR PlayStation

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000
4 game uh the one though I do recommend

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000
and really there's no reason you shouldn't

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
have this if you have a PlayStation VR

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000
but Until Dawn Rush of Blood

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
is free and that's just seriously one of

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
the best games on the on the platform

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
um so definitely check that out

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
that's you it's on

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
Playlink and then of course on

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
PlayStation 3 R-Type Dimensions

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
on PlayStation 3 and Ragdoll

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000
Kung Fu Fists of Plastic on

PS3 then they have um

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
Fravita Dungeon Punks

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
uh which is also cross platform with

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
PlayStation 4 and Broken Sword 5

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
which is on Vita and

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000
those should be available shortly

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000
um and then of course

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000
another thing coming to the PlayStation

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
VR um platform

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
as well sorry I was giving

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
Loki theme music there sorry

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
um is Stranger Things

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000
the VR experience now

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000
I'm not sure what exactly this is

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
um they kinda showed a little bit

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000
of a teaser but it

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000
sorta resembles the

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
I don't know if it was a VR experience

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
or like a 360

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
video that I watched for Stranger Things

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
um they had something that was kinda

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
tied in with like the first season of

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
of the show

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
it was in like Will's house and stuff

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
and it was alright

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
if that's the same thing I hope it's

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
more to that because I would like

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
something a little bit more elaborate but

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
I'm thinking it may just be that because

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
that was available on the mobile VR

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
platforms not too long ago

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000
but we'll see hopefully it's something

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
more exciting

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000
alright well guess what the modders are

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
up to recently they're still playing with

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
Super Mario 64 this time it's not about that

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
multiplayer thing that uh

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
got the uh the other

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
uh Mario thing shut down but this time it looks like

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
somebody's put a portal gun

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
into Super Mario 64

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
this was by modder

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
Kaze Emanuar

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000
who did a video called Portal

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
Mario 64 which of course you can download

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000
right now before Nintendo shuts it down

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000
and you can do the portal mechanic from Portal

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
with Super Mario 64

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000
I mean need I say more about that

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
sounds awesome

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000
yeah it does sound awesome

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000
why not both

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000
yes why not both

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000
I think we talked about this console

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000
not that long ago but it's the super

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000
retro bit micro console

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
I think they had a regular version of this that was

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000
kind of amped but now they have a new one coming out

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000
and it was going to be Capcom and Data East

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
titles like Strider, Final Fight, Joe

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
and Mac well they

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
also kind of teased it with and more

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
to come right well now we figured out

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000
what the more is Technos

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.000
is the next publisher

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
from the classic days that it's

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000
going to be contributing to this which means

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000
Double Dragon will be coming

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.000
to this as well as

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000
Combat Tribes and Renegade

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
so there it is 60 bucks for the

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.000
console which I guess is coming out later

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
this year that's kind of neat Dark

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
Sakura what do you have for us

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
well I guess kind of sadness

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
except he's doing it on

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000
why didn't it open

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000
sorry I just had a slight technical

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
difficulty because it tried to open the

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
RSS version yay

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
anyway the

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000
producer of Danganronpa

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.000
Saito Yuichiro is leaving

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000
Spike Chunsoft

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000
basically

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000
he said as of

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000
the end of October he's resigned

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000
and

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
they did a Danganronpa

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000
surprise farewell party for him

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
and he's going to be doing

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000
console games for

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
a different world

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
he said and he's also

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000
wearing

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000
in this

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000
he's wearing Doraemon pajamas because

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
he's also a big Doraemon fan which

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000
I think is funny because the

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000
original voice actor for

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000
Monokuma was also

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000
Doraemon back in the day so

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000
pretty cool although

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000
he or she's not doing very well so very

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
sad and then an easter egg

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000
an ass creed sorry

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000
assassin's creed

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
because they like the ass

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000
is

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000
the TARDIS so basically if

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000
you're in Letopolis

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000
going through ancient

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000
Egypt under the

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000
water you will see a

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000
stone TARDIS it is very

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000
clearly the TARDIS as well

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000
so the

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000
doctor was here

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000
and that's it

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.000
alright let's travel around

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
and check out what is in stores

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000

hopefully that doesn't suck

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000
but I'm afraid it might

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000

hey that DJ Max

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000
Respect gets its Japanese

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000
release I was wondering when that was going to happen

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000
so DJ Max Respect gets its release in

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000
Japan on November 9th I wonder if we'll get that in the

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
US at some point on the PlayStation 4

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000

tanks and war

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000
sim type games I think that's kind of in the

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000
vein of Nobunaga's ambition

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000
let's see if there's anything on the Vita

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000

makes its way out to Japan

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000
but I don't think we really have

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000
any major releases in Japan this week

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.000
one minor one

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.000
Cake Yasen Monogatari

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000
Oishi Sweet

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.000
wo su koru comes out

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.000
this week oh my god I want to play a cake

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.000
game it's a cake game it's a cake baking

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000
game it's

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000
it's like Legend of Cake

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000
or something like that yeah

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000
maybe it's like Iron Chef

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000
but with cakes

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.000

I want to be the ultimate cake eater

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000
anyway it's probably quiet this week because

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000
next week there's a little game coming out in Japan

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000
called oh it's actually two of them Pokemon

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.000
Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.000
and I think there'll be a lot of people excited about

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000
that on the 3DS

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.000
alright how about the UK Dark Sakura

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:23.000
we have on the 7th

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.000
Super Lucky's Tale

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000
on PC and the bone

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000
all over

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.000
but we have to go to the mail bag

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.000
we're not done hearing from Dark Sakura

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
just yet

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000
and Dark Sakura dives in the mail bag

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000
head first and finds some emails

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000
worth our time reading on the show

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.000
although with the weeks and weeks

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000
and weeks of no show

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
I'm sure we've been flooded with emails

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000
one

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.000
stinkin' email let's get to it

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000
hello LR

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000
hi YYR you're the only one who starts it that way

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.000
after the

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.000
continued discussion last week on

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
free-to-play style monetizations

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.000
and loot boxes being present in AAA games

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:19.000
nowadays

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000
and about the potential reasons why I felt

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.000
a need to chime in because something about

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:25.000
this seems a bit familiar to me

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000
throughout my life I've spent a lot of time

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000
in arcades but I started talking to

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000
owners and operators when I was in college

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.000
back then in 1999

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.000
I remember the operator

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:37.000
of an Aladdin's castle asking me

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:39.000
what do you think the biggest earning

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000
game in this place is? Tekken Tag Tournament

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:43.000
was hugely popular upon its

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:45.000
release I was

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000
one of probably at least a dozen players

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:49.000
who played it every weekend

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.000
so that was my guess but that wasn't the

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:53.000
answer I was shocked when

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.000
this man said to me it's that coin pusher

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:57.000
over there

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:59.000
just a few years ago I owned a DJMax Technica

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:01.000
cabinet and made a deal with the owner

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.000
of an arcade in Queens to host it there

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:05.000
and split the revenues I love

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:07.000
the fact that he also had several other

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:09.000
fantastic hardcore games such as

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:11.000
DDRX2

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:13.000
the latest

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:15.000
Beatmania 2DX and Popin' Music

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:17.000
plus an Initial D, Maximum Tune

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:19.000
Tekken 6 and others being conveyed

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.000
to me a sad truth the loyal crowd of

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:23.000
hardcore players the ones that kept coming

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:25.000
back to play these games over and over again

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:27.000
were not nearly enough to keep his doors open

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.000
the casual players that fed his ticket

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:31.000
redemption and prized games were a far greater

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:33.000
source of income

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:35.000
backing up this theory even

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.000
further is the story of

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:39.000
Nanowet Arcade

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000
which opened in Fall 2014

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000
and was filled to the brim with over 50 arcade games

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.000
spanning all eras and genre

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.000
plus a number of pinball tables

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000
but absolutely no ticket redemption at all

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000
when I visited it felt like someone's dream

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000
arcade but with no redemption I wondered about its

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.000
long term viability as it turned out

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:57.000
it closed forever just a few days before its first

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:59.000
birthday so what does this

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000
have to do with loot boxes and console games

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.000
here it is think back

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.000
to a generation or two every time

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000
a movie came out there were console

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000
and handheld games to match

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.000
you had games for kids

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.000
games based on Disney properties

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.000
games for casuals games for families

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.000
this is all because you had

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000
millions upon millions of casual

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.000
console gamers where are they now

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000
the answer is simple poking away at

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.000
phones and tablets

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000
according to a statistics site

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.000
around 69 million of the most popular game

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:31.000
consoles and handhelds were sold worldwide

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:33.000
in 2011 by 2016

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:35.000
this figure shrank to around 27 million

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:37.000
that's a drop of more than 50%

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:39.000
the same sites claim that within the

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:41.000
US overall dollar sales of consoles

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000
and handheld video games dropped about

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:45.000
50% between 2009 and 2015

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000
with spending on social media

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.000
based and mobile games more than doubling

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:51.000
over that same period

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000
over the last few years our hardware has progressed

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:55.000
AAA games look better than ever

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.000
budgets have fattened

02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:59.000
development team sizes have increased and even

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:01.000
worse market competition has exploded

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000
and yet the casual audience who used to

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.000
generate half the revenue has all but

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:07.000
vanished from the arcade of the modern gaming market

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:09.000
how can the hardcore

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:11.000
keep the doors open

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.000
since we don't have real

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.000
redemption games we substitute the next best thing

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:17.000
loot boxes quite honestly

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.000
I think we're seeing the beginning of a huge

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:21.000
market shake up one that we'll see the

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.000
larger game developers and publishers needing to

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:25.000
make massive changes just to keep their doors open

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.000
except for Nintendo because they're Nintendo

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
I guess we'll see keeping the

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000
discussion going

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.000
at home started getting better and better

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000
right when we were talking about the classic system of the week

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.000
of the month this week we talked you were

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000
mentioning that the games looked as

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000
good as they did in the arcades and that was the early

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:11.000
90s that was kind of the beginning of the

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:13.000
end which is why we don't have things like Flynn's

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.000
arcade anymore because

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:17.000
you can get a lot of those similar experiences

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:19.000
at home but that also kind

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.000
of goes I think for the arcades to kind of do

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:23.000
a soul searching a little bit you know what

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:25.000
does seem to be doing well in arcades right now

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.000
well shit it's kind of come full circle

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:29.000
they're stealing a lot of the ideas from

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.000
mobile these loyalty cards

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.000
that unlock new characters or new cards

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000
or new songs in Bimani games

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.000
through EMUs or you know the similar

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:39.000
stuff in

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.000
Square Enix's theater

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.000
in those types of games you know that's

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.000
I see a lot of that stuff kind of selling at

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.000
round one so it is kind of interesting

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000
how a lot of that stuff does seem to be coming full circle

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:51.000
in a way but round one is also

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.000
I mean for all the fucking import games

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.000
we talk about and how it feels great

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000
to be in an arcade that really feels like the arcades

02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.000
that we used to go to in our twenties like

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.000
round one is also well

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000
over half redemption games

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:05.000
there's so many

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:07.000
freaking crane games well and on top of that

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:09.000
too you know I think that

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.000
the arcades that are

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.000
really the ones that are thriving

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:17.000
are the ones that have the right balance

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000
between the redemption like

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000
remember when we went to round one

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.000
I think half the time was spent

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.000
on the Bimani and the other half was

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.000
spent on those claws not me

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.000
that's you that was me well okay

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:31.000
that was me you're the claw addict but

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.000
you know I love those things and I got a

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:35.000
really crappy looking no

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:37.000
I got the blooper and I got a Yoshi

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.000
you can spend your money on whatever the fuck you

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.000
like but I think that it's also

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:43.000
I think the concept that the

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:45.000
average person who

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:47.000
people like to get something

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000
that's another thought that I have about it

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000
people like to have

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000
either some kind of tangible

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000
or quantifiable result

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:57.000
for the time that they've spent doing

02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.000
something it's not just the joy

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.000
of playing anymore

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000
they want something for it people have this

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000
competitive nature and

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.000
they want to see something for their efforts

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:09.000
as Joe and her map points out

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:11.000
bark aid seem to be doing well

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.000
that's true all you have to clean up just

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.000
add booze you know every city's

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:17.000
got one of these at this point

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000
but that's that strikes to me

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.000
more as like games aren't the

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.000
feature at these places I'm sorry to say

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.000
games are the niche

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000
for the bar some bars

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000
have music certain types of music

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.000
some bars have really

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.000
lush seating or food

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:35.000
some bars have arcade machines

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.000
those are the best ones yeah

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:39.000
those are the ones we like but maybe

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:41.000
there's some people that like to go to this other bar

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.000
because they do sports

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000
uh every single

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000
Sacramento Kings game is on all the time at this

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000
bar you know maybe that's another

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000
niche who knows anyway

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:53.000
so uh

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000
alright well thank you for the email yyr

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000
it is it is an interesting perspective I don't know

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:59.000
if I would directly relate redemption

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.000
games to loot boxes but I do

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000
see where you're going and I do kind of think

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:05.000
the industry is a bit of a

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.000
a circle in that regard so there is

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.000
that it's like gambling I guess so

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:11.000
it's similar to

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:13.000
kind of the whole

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:15.000
coin pusher games and stuff I mean

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.000
because that's really what the loot boxes are you're

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.000
gambling to see if you're going to get more

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000
out of that than you put into it

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000
and I guess even with the redemption stuff

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.000
on top of that you're kind of earning tickets

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:27.000
to purchase

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:29.000
something that you want which of course all

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000
the things that they have in the redemption case

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:33.000
are worth like nothing so

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.000
unless of course it's Dave and Busters

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.000
when I worked at an Aladdin's castle

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:39.000
I would save all the little

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:41.000
tickets that kids would leave in the machines

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:43.000
and I would put them in I had this

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:45.000
secret pouch in my purse and I

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:47.000
turned them in before I left and

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.000
got a polaroid camera

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000
and several Tekken 3

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:53.000
shirts that were like

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:55.000
only the ones they gave at the Namco arcades

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.000
so you can get some good stuff

02:12:57.000 --> 02:12:59.000
if you take your time

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.000
alright you know

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.000
you guys have been very well behaved

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.000
and we feel bad for missing last week's

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:07.000
show so you know what I think tonight

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:09.000
we need to bring back a segment that we haven't

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:11.000
done in a very long time and that

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:13.000
segment is listless

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.000
but I do have one small change

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.000
you see the old theme song we used

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:19.000
to use for listless that now gets

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000
our episodes flagged on YouTube for copyright

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:23.000
infringement so I'm going to have to change the

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:25.000
song that we use so I'm very sorry to Crystal Waters

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.000
but blame your music label

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.000
people for content IDing at the drop

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.000
of a hat so I accidentally let

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.000
this sneak out a little bit earlier but I thought a new

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.000
theme we could use for listless is

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:39.000
listless, listless, listless, listless, listless

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:41.000
should this one get us flagged either?

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:43.000
what?

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:45.000
should this one get us flagged either?

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:47.000
eh it might but it would be worth it

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:49.000
ok

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:51.000
so here we go

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:53.000
tonight's list I'm sure you're all dying

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:55.000
to know the topic since we haven't done this in forever

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:57.000
well since we had that news

02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:59.000
story about Just Dance

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:01.000
becoming a live experience

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:03.000
to which Loki at quite

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:05.000
some length discussed here on the show

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:07.000
we thought well then if that's the case

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:09.000
which video game

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:11.000
should become a live

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:13.000
experience so tonight

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.000
we will be building the definitive list

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:17.000
here which video game

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:19.000
needs a live

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:21.000
experience alright so

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.000
you can participate with us over at

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:25.000
live.vognetwork.com and

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:27.000
god I haven't done this segment in forever so I hope

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:29.000
the list works right

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:31.000
but you should see the question pop

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:33.000
up there on the page as well

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:35.000
as our four contestants tonight so we

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:37.000
haven't done listless in a while so this is how it works

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.000
ok by the way it's not list

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:41.000
list it's listless

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:43.000
Elliot it's a little play on words but anyway

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.000
so with listless

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.000
what's gonna happen is that we're gonna

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000
put together the definitive list it's a very

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.000
scientific process there's no argument

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.000
so each host and a special guest

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:55.000
will bring a list of three to

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:57.000
the table and then one by one we're

02:14:57.000 --> 02:14:59.000
gonna go around and determine which item

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.000
is not worthy of the list

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.000
so we'll take a list of twelve items and bring it down to a list

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:05.000
of eight items at which point you

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:07.000
guys will vote in our chat you're gonna click on

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:09.000
your number one and your two answers in that order

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.000
submit them in over at live.vognetwork.com

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:13.000
and we will build the definitive list

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:15.000
to which there is no arguing

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:17.000
it's done and of course

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:19.000
you know we should talk about you know the whole

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:21.000
elimination part of that as well

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:23.000
oh yeah the whole twist where

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:25.000
we made it so that if a host has

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.000
two answers eliminated from their list

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:29.000
the third gets immunity and cannot be eliminated

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:31.000
cause unfortunately we had some issues

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:33.000
in the past where somebody's

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:35.000
list just totally got eliminated

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:37.000
and that was sad so

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:39.000
anyway joining us tonight a very

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:41.000
special guest who you hear sometimes on the show

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:43.000

Overwatch a lot of Overwatch

02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:59.000
and then this phone game

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:01.000

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:03.000

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:05.000

already doing it which video game needs

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000
a live experience I already see some really good answers

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000
there in our chat room so let's get to it

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
let's start building

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
the list Alan we're gonna

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
let our guests go first tonight what is your number

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
three answer for which video game needs

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
to be a live experience showering

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000
with your dad

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:03.000
shower with your dad

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:05.000
simulator I

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:07.000
believe it's the name of the game

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:09.000
and why did you pick this

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:11.000
because it's fucking funny

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:13.000
alright

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:15.000
there it is it has been added to the list

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:17.000
Dark Sakura

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:19.000
what is gonna be your number three pick

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:21.000
I was thinking in terms of games

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:23.000
so I think Farmville

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:25.000
Farmville real life where you get just

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:27.000
like regular casual people who've

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:29.000
never been to a farm and they have to

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:31.000
fucking farm

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
so Farmville is your answer

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
essentially is the game that needs to be

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
Farmville IRL ok Farmville IRL

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
and you said Farmville

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
well it's almost in a way

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
it sounds like kind of like a sick dystopian

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
future where like there are no more

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
it's like being Zsa Zsa Gabor

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:51.000
in Green Acres I was trying

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.000
to go with like that futuristic like

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:55.000
sad approach no I'm thinking Zsa Zsa Gabor

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:57.000
who has no concept of what to do on a fucking farm

02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:59.000
ok what

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:01.000
was it Zsa Zsa or Ava it was Ava

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:03.000
ok one of them

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:05.000
it was a Gabor

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:07.000
alright my number

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:09.000
three answer what item am I

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:11.000
gonna pick for my number three answer

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:13.000
I decided that the experience that needed

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.000
a live event was civilization

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:17.000
yes

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:19.000
civilization would be a live event and you

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:21.000
can actually rule the world

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:23.000
and uh

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:25.000
and nuke Gandhi right back

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:27.000
there you go civilization it's on the list

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:29.000
Loki your number three answer

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:31.000
for what video game needs a live experience

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:33.000
um I see

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:35.000
like the problem I have with like the Just Dance

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:37.000
one was there's really no point to it because

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:39.000
you're basically going to watch

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:41.000
people dressed up like artists

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:43.000
that's you know perform

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:45.000
songs but they aren't the artists that perform

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:47.000
the songs and they're not really performing the songs

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:49.000
dancing so an actual

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:51.000
game that would be like performing music

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:53.000
that I thought was pretty awesome is DJ Heroes

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:55.000
so I would totally see a live

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:57.000
performance of DJ Heroes

02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:59.000
stuff with actual DJs

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:01.000
mashing songs together

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:03.000
so basically Activision's

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.000
E3 press conference from that year

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:07.000
like touring the country

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:09.000
kinda

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:11.000
but you have like Daft Punk

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:13.000
and you know Dead

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:15.000
Mouse and stuff like that I mean it'd be pretty awesome

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:17.000
no I get it that would be awesome that would be awesome

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:19.000
alright some answers well I'll get to

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:21.000
the answers before the last answer we'll get to

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:23.000
our answers from chat but uh let's see

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:25.000
maybe some of us will steal them and put them on the list

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:27.000
for now the number two answer

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:29.000
from Allen

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:31.000
Hotline Miami

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:33.000
Hotline Miami

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:35.000
and why are you picking Hotline Miami

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:37.000
cause that is the dystopian

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:39.000
future listen to this awesome music

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:41.000
you're gonna fucking die

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:43.000
oh shotgun to the face you're dead

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:45.000
are you actually killing people

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:47.000
at the Hotline Miami live experience

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:49.000
no it would be like the um

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:51.000
one of those the Universal

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:53.000
Studios things that's like super

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:55.000
realistic where it's

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:57.000
like don't pay $50

02:19:57.000 --> 02:19:59.000
to have us jump at you and then punch us in the fucking face

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:01.000
or don't go in if you have a heart condition one of those

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:03.000
okay like the scare

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:05.000
events or some Fright Night

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:07.000
something like that alright

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:09.000
Hotline Miami you're at

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:11.000
did I marry you for real your answers are kinda

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:13.000
disturbing

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:15.000
the number two answer

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:17.000
is Hotline Miami

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:19.000
Dark Soccer your number two answer

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:21.000
I was going to say

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:23.000
actually something along the lines of

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:25.000
Call of Duty where it's

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:27.000
basically either like a laser tag or paintball

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:29.000
but they set up like

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:31.000
recreations of like maps

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:33.000
and then you pay to get in and play the maps

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:35.000
they actually have that but you know do they really

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:37.000
they do they did it for uh one of

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:39.000
the Call of Duty's yeah they actually set up a map

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:41.000
and they did it was Airsoft

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:43.000
but does it tour

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:45.000
no there you go

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:47.000
so

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:49.000
what am I calling this Call of Duty

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:51.000
IRL

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:53.000
just like your Farm Bill

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.000
which I need to add Farm Bill IRL

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:57.000
Call of Duty in real life

02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:59.000
I would hope most of this would be IRL

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:01.000
alright Dark Tetsuya says

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:03.000
that would be kinda cool so you have at least

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:05.000
one paying customer there you go

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:07.000
alright my number two answer is

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:09.000
just make Blizzard World

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:11.000
real just

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:13.000
everybody lost their shit

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:15.000
at that press conference

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:17.000
when Blizzard showed that as

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:19.000
the new Overwatch map so my answer is

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:21.000
just make Blizzard World real just

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:23.000
if you build it they will come just do it

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:25.000
but not in China do it

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:27.000
here no offense to China but

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:29.000
we need one

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:31.000
here for the US income

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:33.000
and all that good stuff or at least our

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:35.000
friends in Canada alright just build

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:37.000
Blizzard World IRL

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:39.000

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:43.000
Splatoon

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:45.000
oh that's a good answer why did you

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:47.000
say Splatoon because it's just like paintball

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:49.000
except you're shooting on the walls and everything

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:51.000
and it would be really messy and I

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:53.000
at least see people playing that people like

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:55.000
doing was it like the Tough Mudder stuff

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:57.000
where they covered in mud so what about paint

02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:59.000
Splatoon 5k

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:01.000
or you could do like

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:03.000
the Splatfest or something like that

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:05.000
no

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:07.000
I'm not going to go there because I was going to say

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:09.000
covered in ketchup

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:11.000
no

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:13.000
alright here is the list

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:15.000
as it stands so far Shower With Your Dad

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:17.000
Simulator, Hotline Miami, Farmville

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:19.000

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:21.000

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:31.000
part where we eliminate answers

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:33.000
so here we go over to Allen what is your number

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:35.000
one answer for

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:37.000
video game that they need to make

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:39.000

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:41.000
Valve Studio presents the number

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:47.000

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:49.000
the number three

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:51.000
they would have a Half-Life

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:53.000
episode 3 area

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:55.000
and they would have a Half-Life 3 area and they would have a

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:57.000
Left 4 Dead 3 area and this would be the only place

02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:59.000
you could actually ever play these games

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:01.000
yeah and they would have three

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:03.000
Gabe Newell's you give them

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:05.000
your money and he just fucking laughs

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:07.000
three of them just laughs

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:09.000

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:25.000
number one answer

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:27.000
Sims The Tour

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:29.000
where basically

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:31.000
you have to be in

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:33.000
a Sims environment and

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:35.000
can't do anything until someone

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:37.000
controlling you tells you you can't

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:39.000
I'm gonna get out of this pool

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:41.000
I'm gonna drown in here

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:43.000
I really need to use the bathroom

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:45.000
if they don't let you pee then you have to pee your pants

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:47.000
that's not fun and wear really horrible clothing

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:49.000
and you can only speak Simlish

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:51.000
me me me wah bweeb wah boo boo

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:53.000
and

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:55.000
Katy Perry's there doing a concert in

02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:57.000
Simlish because she had that

02:23:57.000 --> 02:23:59.000
song that was in Simlish which was ridiculous

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:01.000
but it was funny

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:03.000
we're almost there to the end of the list

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:05.000
here JD in chat says

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:07.000
so the power exchange I don't know if that's

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:09.000
that or one of the chat answers but anyway

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:11.000
my number one answer

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:13.000
on top of the list I'm gonna go

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:15.000
you know here at OLR

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:17.000
we have to respect the classics

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:19.000
right so I'm gonna go with one of the

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:21.000
all time classics here at Orange

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:23.000
Lounge Radio in fact I would

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:25.000
I would bet many of you don't even fucking

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:27.000
know this game if it wasn't for Orange

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:29.000
Lounge Radio but at one time

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:31.000
it was so noteworthy it was our classic game

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:33.000
of the week and I think it's time to bring back

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:35.000
the 21 anniversary

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:37.000
21 year anniversary tour of

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:39.000

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:47.000
like an actual event though I mean

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:49.000
but does it tour

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:51.000
I

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:53.000
maybe I don't know

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:55.000

02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:57.000

Dungeon Buster says Streets of Rage 3

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:33.000
Someone Gets to be the Kangaroo

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:35.000
Who the fuck said Custer's Revenge

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:37.000
Rage

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:39.000
Sjoan Hunter Matt

02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:41.000
No that's not fucking cool

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:43.000

was it Rabbids or Rayman?

02:25:57.000 --> 02:25:59.000
I think it was on the list so there you go

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:01.000
Alright

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:03.000
Those are what the chatters said

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:05.000
Loki, what did you say?

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.000

Dead or Alive

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000
Extreme Beach Volleyball but

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:13.000
being that we have Mr. New World on there

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:15.000
I probably won't do that so

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:17.000
Nah I'm still gonna go with

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:19.000

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:23.000
Cause

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:25.000
of all the obvious reasons

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.000
Say No More

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:29.000
Say No More, that's just the Olympics

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.000
Alright

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:33.000
It's like the Olympics

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:35.000
Like the

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:37.000
XFL of the Olympics

02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:39.000
Here is the list as it stands

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:41.000

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:43.000
Simulator, Hotline Miami

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:45.000

02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:59.000
Now it's tough but it's

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:01.000
part of the process

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:03.000
Alan, you gotta go first. Which of these

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:05.000
is not worthy of the list?

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:09.000
I don't wanna be mean

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:11.000
and get rid of anyone's

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:13.000
I feel that

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.000
God dammit

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.000
Can I do one of my own?

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:23.000
I don't know if we've ever had that happen before

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:25.000
Can a host take one of their own off the list?

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:27.000
Alright, why not? Sure

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:29.000
Yes, a host can take their own item off the list

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:31.000
Half Life or the Valve 3 thing

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:33.000
Dammit, that's what I was gonna pick

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:35.000
Alright, why are we eliminating

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:37.000
Valve the number three?

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:39.000
Cause it's not a game, it was just me making fun of Valve

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:41.000
I was gonna say cause you could go there

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:43.000
and there'd be nothing there cause they

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:45.000
don't produce the number three of anything

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:47.000
Alright, so in an OLR

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:49.000
first, Alan has taken

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:51.000
his own item off the list

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:53.000
Valve presents the number three

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:55.000
is stricken from the list

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:57.000
Dark Sakura

02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:59.000
Which of these is not worthy of the list?

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:01.000
Sorry Alan, I'm taking off shower with your dad

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:03.000
Ah, shower with your dad

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.000
simulator. Poor

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:07.000
Alan. First, well of course he did it to

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:09.000
himself, so there it is

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:11.000
That's right, Hotline Miami

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.000
The Hotline Miami was pretty rad

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.000
Now has immunity, but shower with your dad

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:17.000
has been stricken from the list

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:19.000
Ooh, my turn, what am I gonna eliminate from the list?

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:21.000
Um

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:23.000
These are, like

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:25.000
yeah, this is a pretty good roundup of answers

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:27.000
Um

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:29.000
I'm gonna, I'm gonna

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:31.000
Sorry Jamie, I'm gonna take one of yours

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:33.000
I'm doing Farm Bill

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:35.000
Just because, like, I think you and I

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:37.000
have a different vision of what that would be

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:39.000
and I wasn't jealous

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:41.000
I just think it would be hilarious

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:43.000
to have, like, regular people have to actually do a farm

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:45.000
Eh, fair enough

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:47.000
But unfortunately, I've already clicked the button

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:49.000
It's gone, so, sorry Jamie

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:51.000
Alright, Loki, last but not least

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:53.000
the last one, which of these is not worthy

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:55.000
of the list?

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:57.000
Um, I'm just gonna have to take Miss Nude World

02:28:57.000 --> 02:28:59.000
96 off there

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:01.000
Oh, you bastard! Oh, why would you

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.000
eliminate Miss Nude World?

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:05.000
I mean, it's old, it's just

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:07.000
Oh, I see, you're afraid

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:09.000
that now it's about

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:11.000
Although, I think that folks

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:13.000
in their 50s can be just as fabulous

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:15.000
that maybe, maybe

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:17.000
we, you know, these folks that were in their

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:19.000
prime at one point, or maybe

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:21.000
maybe they shouldn't be touring

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:23.000
It's just, it's gonna be weird with demons

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:25.000
and, like, and just, like

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:27.000
old Bikini models

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:29.000
and porn stars, I just

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:31.000
it's just, it's gonna be, like, weird

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:33.000
Oh, the mic, sorry

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:35.000
Yeah, I mean, superficially

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:37.000
it's naked ladies, but if you've actually

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:39.000
played Miss Nude World, if any

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.000
college kids tried to go to that high

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:43.000
Mm-mm, no, like what

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:45.000
Loki is saying, that's a bad time

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:47.000
Alright, well

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:49.000
rules are rules, so that is it

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:51.000
It has been removed from

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:53.000
the list, but the list is now

02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:55.000
clickable, and you guys can vote

02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:57.000
over at live.vognetwork.com

02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:59.000

if you screw up, you're gonna have to reload the page

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:07.000
cause I don't think you can undo unless

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:09.000
we have that fixed, anyway, here's the list as

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:11.000
it stands, Hotline Miami

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:13.000
Call of Duty IRL

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:15.000
Sims the Tour, Civilization

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:17.000
Just Make Blizzard World Real

02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:19.000
DJ Hero, Splatoon

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:21.000
and DOA Extreme

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:23.000
Beach Volleyball

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:25.000
There it is, which video game needs a live experience?

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:27.000
I'm really confident

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:29.000
of one, possibly both

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:31.000
that are gonna win, and I could've been a dick

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:33.000
and I was like, that's a really good thing, so I'm gonna be a dick

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:35.000
and get rid of it, and I didn't, and I took

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:37.000
one in the knee for myself

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:39.000
You took an arrow to the knee, as appropriate for him

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:41.000
It's too bad, cause I would've voted for the same one

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:43.000
that you took away, so you could've

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:45.000
Alright, well

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:47.000

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:44.660
this

02:31:44.660 --> 02:31:46.320
this

02:31:46.320 --> 02:31:47.860
this

02:31:47.860 --> 02:31:49.760
this

02:31:49.760 --> 02:31:50.740
this

02:31:50.740 --> 02:31:56.780
this

02:31:56.780 --> 02:31:59.780
this

02:31:59.780 --> 02:32:01.180
this

02:32:01.180 --> 02:32:02.740
this

02:32:02.740 --> 02:32:04.120
this

02:32:04.120 --> 02:32:04.540
satisfied

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:12.040
dual they have stereo speakers in the front and for her mod lithium ion

02:32:12.040 --> 02:32:19.560
battery so it looks alright I mean considering what phones go for nowadays

02:32:19.560 --> 02:32:24.520
you know that price range is actually not so bad so that's on on Verizon

02:32:24.520 --> 02:32:30.120
because that's what I have but who says I'm gonna stick with Verizon so there's

02:32:30.120 --> 02:32:36.640
a gaming phone and 120 FPS you know what that would be really good for and I

02:32:36.640 --> 02:32:43.080
don't know if it supports it though VR VR content but is there any is this phone

02:32:43.080 --> 02:32:47.760
compatible with any of the VR platforms that are on Android I would be very

02:32:47.760 --> 02:32:52.520
interested to find out because if it is and hell yes I'm on board

02:32:52.520 --> 02:32:56.560
Brad from pop culture says the razor phone looks kind of cool

02:32:56.560 --> 02:33:01.920
corky says 120 Hertz isn't a new thing in portable devices the iPad Pro has one

02:33:01.920 --> 02:33:06.480
so but you know those iPad pros are probably a little more expensive than

02:33:06.480 --> 02:33:12.480
this device so yeah 700 for a phone mean look at the Samsung Galaxy s8 and the

02:33:12.480 --> 02:33:19.160
node 8 and I mean that 700 is not that ridiculous as far as phone prices go

02:33:19.160 --> 02:33:23.520
yeah it's actually kind of a little bit on the lower end all right

02:33:23.520 --> 02:33:27.240
raising your wants to know will the phone play Miss nude world 96 yes

02:33:27.240 --> 02:33:36.120
probably would I think of a 486 PC can play this new world 96 to be fair all

02:33:36.120 --> 02:33:42.240
right let's talk about Niantic the company behind Pokemon go and ingress

02:33:42.240 --> 02:33:46.000
which you know we don't know what else they're working on but we do know they

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:51.280
have acquired a company named Evertune that's right Evertune was acquired by

02:33:51.280 --> 02:33:56.040
Niantic this week and John Hanke the CEO of Niantic announced this Evertune

02:33:56.040 --> 02:33:59.720
is a recently established mobile animation app and they're doing this to

02:33:59.720 --> 02:34:05.540
expand the social media functionality of the games Evertune was founded in 2016

02:34:05.540 --> 02:34:10.480
and the startup raised 1.7 million today from a variety of publishers for their

02:34:10.480 --> 02:34:15.700
film sharing app for social networks like YouTube or Twitter so one could

02:34:15.700 --> 02:34:19.480
imagine that maybe there will be something where Pokemon are animated or

02:34:19.480 --> 02:34:22.520
something in a later version of Pokemon go but really this could be anything

02:34:22.520 --> 02:34:27.460
Pokemon animated emojis it could be something for a future game Niantic is

02:34:27.460 --> 02:34:32.000
planning that we just don't know yet ingress animated emojis who knows who

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:34.960
knows you know speaking of this whole like Pokemon go and all this stuff I

02:34:34.960 --> 02:34:38.000
didn't get into this during my gaming week but did you know there's a knock

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:43.600
off game in the App Store and usually usually knock off no game all right

02:34:43.600 --> 02:34:47.480
tell me there's Garfield game on there at some point too but here's the thing

02:34:47.480 --> 02:34:52.880
so the latest knockoff game is called Draconius go which is like dragons and

02:34:52.880 --> 02:34:59.480
stuff and they don't have the same like logical layout of gyms and stuff like

02:34:59.480 --> 02:35:04.160
Pokemon go has when you first look at the game you'd be like this game is a

02:35:04.160 --> 02:35:09.920
complete flippin ripoff of Pokemon go and like because it looks like imagine

02:35:09.920 --> 02:35:13.600
what Pokemon go looked like in February before they announced gen 2 before they

02:35:13.600 --> 02:35:18.400
did the gyms this is what Draconius go kind of looks like at first glance like

02:35:18.400 --> 02:35:21.700
it's all the same stuff to look there's a little dragon thingy I don't think I

02:35:21.700 --> 02:35:25.520
have this one yet on the house so I'm gonna capture that yes Alan with the

02:35:25.520 --> 02:35:28.720
exception of the critters it really looks like they downloaded the AP get

02:35:28.720 --> 02:35:34.320
AP gay ha APK and like just unzipped it with like a dash tar well it's all

02:35:34.320 --> 02:35:38.120
unity so they could just reverse engineer so when we say it's a knock

02:35:38.120 --> 02:35:43.280
off it it really has a lot of the actual original layout gooey and everything is

02:35:43.280 --> 02:35:48.000
all but here's the reason why I bring it up so yes at first glance when you

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:50.920
play it for the first five minutes right this is a complete fucking ripoff of

02:35:50.920 --> 02:35:56.640
Pokemon go but then you start to see they added more there's PvP in it

02:35:56.640 --> 02:36:01.160
there's different types of ways to retrain your monsters in it there's like

02:36:01.160 --> 02:36:04.960
these other features the Pokemon go doesn't have and you know what Niantic

02:36:04.960 --> 02:36:08.360
is pissed and I think they're going after this developer for infringement

02:36:08.360 --> 02:36:12.360
basically but it also kind of goes to show like hey these guys have added

02:36:12.360 --> 02:36:15.320
these features to the game that you guys have been kind of sitting on for

02:36:15.320 --> 02:36:17.920
months so it's just interesting I'm not saying if it's right or wrong or

02:36:17.920 --> 02:36:20.700
anything but it's just an interesting development well they don't own the

02:36:20.700 --> 02:36:26.080
copyright to that type of gameplay granted it looks very similar but change

02:36:26.080 --> 02:36:29.940
up that that's fine a lawsuit that you come up with that just change the way

02:36:29.940 --> 02:36:36.520
your game looks enough and you know put it as your own thing I mean I don't know

02:36:36.520 --> 02:36:39.480
there's a lot of games to come out that are that people think are knockoffs

02:36:39.480 --> 02:36:42.920
everything like remember everything is they oh it's a street fire clone or oh

02:36:42.920 --> 02:36:45.960
that's you know just a clone of this game that's a minecraft clone and then

02:36:45.960 --> 02:36:51.800
it all becomes its own thing now I want to catch this creature because I don't

02:36:51.800 --> 02:36:55.000
have one yet there's the one of the creatures is called a potty and that

02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:59.320
made me laugh because it's an actual little fire pot oh I was thinking it was

02:36:59.320 --> 02:37:02.320
a potty and I know but that's well I laughed because the name it does make

02:37:02.320 --> 02:37:05.200
you think of that anyway there you go so I don't want to give this game too much

02:37:05.200 --> 02:37:08.680
credit but I thought it was interesting that they've kind of taken the template

02:37:08.680 --> 02:37:12.920
for Pokemon go and added a ton of shit to it and I'm sure Niantic ain't happy

02:37:12.920 --> 02:37:16.800
about it so there you go who fucking who add some fucking features to it and maybe

02:37:16.800 --> 02:37:21.280
fix some of the hacking problems yeah little little competition may help who

02:37:21.280 --> 02:37:25.720
knows we'll see all right let's move on we have some more news Stark Sakura well

02:37:25.720 --> 02:37:29.680
I'm still super excited about Dragon Ball fighter Z even though the story

02:37:29.680 --> 02:37:33.960
mode is gonna be fucking bizarre basically you're playing quantum leap

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:39.520
you are showing up in the bodies of these different Dragon Ball characters

02:37:39.520 --> 02:37:46.680
let's try to go through the story and you've got this other artificial human

02:37:46.680 --> 02:37:53.080
who is talking about eating you like like legit food like she says that

02:37:53.080 --> 02:37:57.800
everyone's tasty but like at the the start of the trailer it's like you wake

02:37:57.800 --> 02:38:03.000
up and you're in Goku's body and it's really bizarre so I don't know it's

02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:07.320
gonna be fun the trailer looks really neat though it's such a pretty game I'm

02:38:07.320 --> 02:38:14.400
so excited and honestly enough it it is rendered in game but it looks like real

02:38:14.400 --> 02:38:19.760
animation and that's what I'm super impressed by so super excited it needs to

02:38:19.760 --> 02:38:24.440
oh and it's gonna be of course out I think January 2018 yeah yeah I was

02:38:24.440 --> 02:38:28.000
about to say how long is the wait for this game because sorry January 26th

02:38:28.200 --> 02:38:35.800
okay that's not too bad yeah it's not bad excitement don't kill spiders die

02:38:35.800 --> 02:38:39.080
have to it was trying to it was looking at me catch it and take it outside

02:38:39.080 --> 02:38:44.080
sizing me up to eat me up just take it I got one out of my bed and took it

02:38:44.080 --> 02:38:50.840
outside it was a cute little wolf spider Rob gross they eat mosquitoes yeah

02:38:50.840 --> 02:38:55.800
anyway let's go to a couple more stories for you guys we're gonna open up the

02:38:55.800 --> 02:38:58.680
skype line briefly we're running a little long time so we can't take too

02:38:58.680 --> 02:39:04.000
many calls we'll open up the skype line briefly but first Loki all right so this

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:07.720
is a game that I've you know been interested to see a localization forward

02:39:07.720 --> 02:39:14.680
they've never done it so captain rainbow has a fan translation for the game

02:39:14.680 --> 02:39:20.080
because it was originally only released in Japan and that's kind of where it

02:39:20.080 --> 02:39:24.240
ended there but you can actually check it out now so they have it's a patch

02:39:24.240 --> 02:39:31.320
made by a guy goes by mark ass that's right and he basically combines the

02:39:31.320 --> 02:39:37.920
works of his translation group kirameki along with his stuff as well so now

02:39:37.920 --> 02:39:43.180
it's almost 100% complete but there's still a few things missing but it should

02:39:43.180 --> 02:39:46.760
be enough to at least play the game nice that's kind of cool enough to get you

02:39:46.760 --> 02:39:51.240
through all right this is the last chance to submit listless votes it will

02:39:51.240 --> 02:39:54.440
be closing shortly so if you have not submitted your listless votes tonight

02:39:54.440 --> 02:39:57.920
make sure you get to live dot vog network comm and get those votes in last

02:39:57.920 --> 02:40:02.960
call meanwhile one more story for you guys tonight and that is that something's

02:40:02.960 --> 02:40:06.880
going on with Konami because they're acting kind of shitty to their composer

02:40:06.880 --> 02:40:11.800
teams that create the music in Bamani games obviously things like beat mania

02:40:11.800 --> 02:40:16.480
DDR and even the newer stuff like music and you know sound voltix and stuff

02:40:16.480 --> 02:40:20.460
would be nothing if it wasn't for the actual music in the games but what's

02:40:20.460 --> 02:40:24.580
interesting about it is that now these songs in the game are being attributed

02:40:24.580 --> 02:40:30.220
to Bamani sound team that's right so we don't see you know the actual creator of

02:40:30.220 --> 02:40:35.940
the songs anymore it's just attributed to Bamani sound team so yeah some folks

02:40:35.940 --> 02:40:40.140
are theorizing that this could go back to a dispute about how there's a record

02:40:40.140 --> 02:40:43.820
label called beat nation records that came out about a decade ago and this has

02:40:43.820 --> 02:40:49.380
led to live concerts and soundtrack CDs and so on and Konami may actually be a

02:40:49.380 --> 02:40:54.180
little bit afraid of this so they want to control their artists very well hmm I

02:40:54.180 --> 02:40:57.620
don't know it sounds like a very BuzzFeed thing to do well and it's it's

02:40:57.620 --> 02:41:02.260
just kind of just add that to the list of grievances we have with Konami and

02:41:02.260 --> 02:41:07.220
ask Atari how well that went back in the 2600 days with not crediting your

02:41:07.220 --> 02:41:11.980
creators and what happened is the cause of that the answer is we got Activision

02:41:11.980 --> 02:41:18.460
which made better games for Atari's own platform mm-hmm so anyway uh there you

02:41:18.460 --> 02:41:22.660
go I don't know if you guys have anything to say about that but just I'm

02:41:22.660 --> 02:41:27.580
not surprised considering the source yeah add add this to the list of Konami

02:41:27.580 --> 02:41:33.340
grievances shall we all right before we get those bastards before we get to the

02:41:33.340 --> 02:41:37.100
skype line which we are about ready to open up dark soccer has requested that

02:41:37.100 --> 02:41:39.640
we bring back another segment we haven't done in a while and it's something we

02:41:39.640 --> 02:41:44.100
can do on demand but it's CF use of the week

02:41:48.460 --> 02:41:50.460
you

02:41:57.780 --> 02:42:05.500
my SU goes to people who don't respect the word stop especially when the person

02:42:05.500 --> 02:42:13.220
who is requesting that you stop happens to be autistic usually we're gonna tell

02:42:13.220 --> 02:42:17.740
you to stop something if it's necessary or else if we don't see anything it's

02:42:17.740 --> 02:42:23.380
going to be very ugly so when someone says I don't want to do this anymore

02:42:23.380 --> 02:42:31.340
fucking respect them I'm in a pass because I'll sub tweet something and put

02:42:31.340 --> 02:42:34.500
my foot in my mouth so low do you want to say anything yeah we say that if you

02:42:34.500 --> 02:42:37.100
do the people that are driving in front of me on the way this show today they

02:42:37.100 --> 02:42:43.020
were driving 20 miles an hour in a 35 what the hell come on people I get it

02:42:43.020 --> 02:42:49.040
you're old but Jesus Christ man you close to this be long a good old-fashioned

02:42:49.040 --> 02:42:54.820
fu2 bad drivers it's a slow driver they are there's bad drivers everywhere

02:42:55.820 --> 02:43:03.180
all right I think it's time to close up the list and see what the ants actual

02:43:03.180 --> 02:43:08.540
results were here which I think I'd have to keep this answerable but not live I

02:43:08.540 --> 02:43:13.780
think was the way I do this I have to remember this here it's a tricky thing

02:43:13.780 --> 02:43:18.980
here all right so here it is the actual results from the list the scientific

02:43:18.980 --> 02:43:26.220
process you ready the number three answer a video game that most needs to

02:43:26.220 --> 02:43:31.740
be a live experience dead or alive extreme beach volleyball is the number

02:43:31.740 --> 02:43:37.580
three answer the number two answer tonight this is the one I thought would

02:43:37.580 --> 02:43:42.860
win Splatoon was the number two answer tonight I thought that would be the

02:43:42.860 --> 02:43:48.460
winner Splatoon is the number two and last but not least the number one thing

02:43:48.460 --> 02:43:54.820
you want to see a live experience of just make Blizzard world real just make

02:44:08.800 --> 02:44:14.080

this one more call that sent me a private message saying it's fixed hi

02:47:45.260 --> 02:47:50.340
you're on orange on its radio who's this what was my bad I muted my entire sound

02:47:50.340 --> 02:47:53.740
system while I was gone for the whole weekend it did not realize I was trying

02:47:53.740 --> 02:47:57.620
to call you guys that's okay it's just you know the joys of live radio what's

02:47:57.620 --> 02:48:01.660
on your mind my friend okay first of all hi I'm Ron well y'all probably know

02:48:01.660 --> 02:48:07.340
me by now but um I would hope so yeah as I'm coming back from my amazing trip

02:48:07.340 --> 02:48:11.660
this weekend and listening to you guys are tuning radio I want to call an

02:48:11.660 --> 02:48:19.740
objection on one of the titles on listless yes DJ hero okay why are we

02:48:19.740 --> 02:48:24.480
objecting to DJ hero you don't need to make that a live experience that's what

02:48:24.480 --> 02:48:29.080
a rave is for they still have those well isn't that isn't that kind of what we

02:48:29.080 --> 02:48:32.600
were joking that the Just Dance thing basically is is that the Just Dance is

02:48:32.600 --> 02:48:37.040
gonna be a rave for kids more or less I think it's gonna be more like the Just

02:48:37.040 --> 02:48:41.760
Dance is gonna be on stage dancing and the kids will be watching it out like a

02:48:41.760 --> 02:48:46.320
special VIP area where you can dance so like we go to a weird Al concert but

02:48:46.320 --> 02:48:50.520
you're still like the performing music though like actual DJs mixing actual

02:48:50.520 --> 02:48:54.320
songs together not just like playing one track to the next but like actually

02:48:54.320 --> 02:48:58.880
doing live mashups and stuff that's actually talent versus some dumbasses

02:48:58.880 --> 02:49:02.760
dressed up like the artists that originally sang those tracks but not

02:49:02.760 --> 02:49:08.720
quite and then dancing to pre-recorded music so so what Jason did on the good

02:49:08.720 --> 02:49:17.000
place for a short time not to spoil anything but basically that right so you

02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:21.000
could I think and I think Ramos point is that that does I mean to be fair it does

02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:25.200
kind of exist some club I do love Janet's rebound I know I know don't

02:49:25.200 --> 02:49:32.040
spoil all right anyway JD and chat points out there's an event called booty

02:49:32.040 --> 02:49:35.680
NSF that's really what it's called I've heard of this it's a mashup party yeah

02:49:35.680 --> 02:49:38.560
I've always wanted to go to that I've heard of that oh yeah they always they

02:49:38.560 --> 02:49:41.440
talk about that so I I can kind of see where I miss coming from saying that

02:49:41.440 --> 02:49:46.480
event sort of already exists but to be fair to Loki's there is nothing under

02:49:46.480 --> 02:49:50.720
that video game brand perhaps there could be some of that triple-a talent

02:49:50.720 --> 02:49:53.840
that comes in although fat chance but you never know I mean there was that

02:49:53.840 --> 02:49:57.720
there was that legendary press conference here what what year was it

02:49:57.720 --> 02:50:01.780
was 2010 so whenever those games were announced like they had some that's a

02:50:01.780 --> 02:50:06.320
major talent at the staple yeah it was like all these like Eminem and many on

02:50:06.320 --> 02:50:10.200
and all these people like under one roof performing for these games I mean

02:50:10.200 --> 02:50:16.400
Activision probably paid a ton of money for it but didn't go to that I know some

02:50:16.400 --> 02:50:19.520
people I knew went to that I can't remember if Bobby was one of them or not

02:50:19.520 --> 02:50:26.000
I didn't it was one of the years I didn't go so but there you go Rama I

02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:29.640
guess that's our our rebuttal although it's it's a fair perspective you're

02:50:29.640 --> 02:50:33.480
right some of that same stuff kind of already exists out there yeah on the

02:50:33.480 --> 02:50:37.920
plus side um they don't have to worry about the cops coming in to break up the

02:50:37.920 --> 02:50:44.300
rave that is true that is true I hey Rama before we let you go you said you

02:50:44.300 --> 02:50:47.200
were on a great trip this weekend is that something for anime jam session

02:50:47.200 --> 02:50:51.200
this week was it a convention or no this is something more like me Persil's

02:50:51.200 --> 02:50:55.880
me just getting away for a while just kind of like my time to relax and

02:50:55.880 --> 02:51:04.720
recharge and get back into the game eat pray beer oh yeah Oh works what Loki I

02:51:04.720 --> 02:51:07.640
just got another the last minute all right well Rama we're gonna let you go

02:51:07.640 --> 02:51:10.720
then I'm glad to hear you had a good trip and we'll check in with you again

02:51:10.720 --> 02:51:15.760
awesome take care of y'all fight all right what'd you have for us Loki last

02:51:15.840 --> 02:51:21.800
chance to get in last chance so there's gonna be a new rewards thing for Sony

02:51:21.800 --> 02:51:27.080
rewards now through the PlayStation Network so guess what now those trophies

02:51:27.080 --> 02:51:32.200
that you're earning they're actually worth something oh so basically you can

02:51:32.200 --> 02:51:37.520
earn some of the PlayStation points they can be redeemed for like PlayStation

02:51:37.520 --> 02:51:41.560
Network vouchers and other things so here's how it works so you get one you

02:51:41.560 --> 02:51:47.160
have 100 silver trophies you can get 100 points or one point per trophy 25

02:51:47.160 --> 02:51:55.600
gold trophies for 250 points or 10 platinum trophies for 1,000 points huh

02:51:55.600 --> 02:52:00.440
so and you can like earn those I guess that's available through the service so

02:52:00.440 --> 02:52:07.560
go in there if you've got some trophies you can get some free points all right

02:52:07.600 --> 02:52:11.640
interesting how that stuff is making rewards in the real world I wonder if

02:52:11.640 --> 02:52:16.000
we'll hear more about that at PSX that would be very interesting but anyway I

02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:19.640
notice our phone is not lighting up so I think that's gonna do it for the

02:52:19.640 --> 02:52:25.440
skype line tonight which means our show has about come to an end how sad but I

02:52:25.440 --> 02:52:28.780
want to thank you guys for listening to our show tonight and helping it be a

02:52:28.780 --> 02:52:32.200
success if you guys enjoyed what you heard here at orange launch rated

02:52:32.200 --> 02:52:35.160
tonight don't forget to tell a friend or two about the show help us spread the

02:52:35.280 --> 02:52:38.800
word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice but we can't put those

02:52:38.800 --> 02:52:42.400
voices out there if they're not here to call in and send us emails and

02:52:42.400 --> 02:52:45.760
participate on discord and chat and all the places where we try to get your

02:52:45.760 --> 02:52:49.000
voices in on the show and vote in listless they were not a part of that

02:52:49.000 --> 02:52:53.720
scientific process maybe something else maybe hotline Miami would have won if

02:52:53.720 --> 02:52:57.960
more of you would have voted for it so anyway tell a friend or two about the

02:52:57.960 --> 02:53:02.120
show a nice five-star review or ever you heard about this show especially iTunes

02:53:02.280 --> 02:53:05.960
