00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:27,000
There's a lot of headlines I could choose to read from tonight. Instead, I'm going to ask that we take a very critical look at ourselves and our peers. Choose togetherness and fun, not exclusive elitism and derision. Stay tuned for the discussion of this week's news, starting right now.

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight for 19 November 2017, episode number 707 of our show.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:57,000
My name is Rob Roberts, here to talk with you over the next few hours about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle. Here live in our studio, N7, based in lovely Sacramento, California.

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Not here tonight, DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers. She will not be joining us tonight. She has some other hobbies and some other organizations she works with on the side.

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And she's actually doing a charity fundraiser tonight because it is that kind of season for a lot of fundraising with Thanksgiving coming up the next week. A worthy reason for her to be gone tonight, so she will not be with us tonight. She'll be back next week.

9
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Joining me in studio, though, is Techmaster Loki.

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Hello.

11
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Hi, Loki. How are you?

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm fine.

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Welcome back.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Yes.

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So we weren't here last week because I was on vacation, so I hope you guys all had a good long weekend and what have you. Did you do anything exciting with your night off in the show?

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
No.

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
No? I'm sorry to hear that. No Lego building? No video game playing with the kids?

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
No, I think I took the kids somewhere. I don't remember what I did with them.

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Gotcha.

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I think we just went to the store.

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I know, I can't even-

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Oh, no, no. I remember now. We went to the mall because my wife was going to look at iPhones and then we went to the Apple store and I don't get how they think that that's how stores should be because that's stupid.

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Was it overrun with people?

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It was just dumb. It's like, oh, yeah, you have to make an appointment and wait 20 minutes for someone to help you buy a phone that you know you want. And my wife's like, fuck that.

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You can get away with it because people do it.

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
But of course, I don't know, I bought my- I did buy the iPhone 10. I did it all online.

27
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's so courageous of them to lay their stores out in a really shitty configuration.

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Oh, stop.

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:34,000
All right, always joining us here is our chat room because we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice geeks network of vognetwork.com.

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. And you can join us in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

31
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It works again. Bobby, the good old- our pal Bobby Black Wolf, who does the show before us, he did the tech stuff behind the scenes and switched out the chat box.

32
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So it does work again over at live.vognetwork.com.

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Or if you're old school and have an IRC client, you can always just join the game search network and channel VOG.

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And that's where we're at for those of you that know what I'm talking about. Not everybody even knows like what IRC is anymore.

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:12,000
We do have a Discord service for those of you that are into the newer stuff. You can check out our Discord server over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

36
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
We'll get into some of that in just a little bit.

37
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Yeah, I can't believe- time flies. Like I'm not surprised that you can't remember even going to the mall last week because Seattle feels like it was an eternity ago.

38
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Well, it's- it was- yeah.

39
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Even though it was just a week, right? So. But a lot happened in gaming over the past couple weeks.

40
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
But certainly one story has kind of taken the cake this week. So I think we need to kind of address that here at the top of the show.

41
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And we just had like- I don't want to repeat ourselves too much because we just had a kickoff topic not even, what, three weeks ago involving loot boxes.

42
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And yet this-

43
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
They're all the rage.

44
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
This has just really dominated the conversation in gaming culture over the past couple weeks.

45
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And even- I got to give a shout out to our friend of the network Dungeon Buster who did some great articles kind of summarizing this over at vognetwork.com.

46
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
But the whole debacle over loot boxes in Star Wars Battlefront 2.

47
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So I know many of you have been following this but Loki, for those that don't- aren't aware like what the problem is, can you kind of like dumb it down and summarize it for us?

48
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
What's the problem that people are having?

49
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Sure. So the main complaint about loot boxes in Star Wars Battlefront 2 was that a lot of the things featured in those loot boxes were actual buffs to the game to basically give you an advantage.

50
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So if you wanted to, you could pay to win in that game.

51
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And so they were having things like, for example, one of the abilities that Boba Fett has while using his jetpack, he actually could be invulnerable.

52
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So that's one of the things you can unlock if you pay enough money or happen to get enough loot boxes that would allow you to get those star cards.

53
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And then I guess the whole progression system was also tied to how many cards you had.

54
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It was just like very much integrated in the game.

55
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And so, you know, people kind of heard that there was loot boxes in it and then they have this whole kind of early access type thing that they were doing.

56
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm guessing with people that preordered the game or had some sort of special bundle that they bought.

57
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
No, it's that whole paying for EA subscription service.

58
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:32,000
The same thing happened with Andromeda when Mass Effect Andromeda went live on the EA access service, which you have to pay like a monthly fee to use.

59
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,000
People saw all the flaws early and it kind of shot the preorders, you know, as people were starting to cancel preorders.

60
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It really shot the momentum that that game had on its release in the foot.

61
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
For better or for worse, I don't know.

62
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Some people would say for worse because all those preorders getting cancelled kind of wrecked the series, even though a lot of those issues got taken care of via patch.

63
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Some people would say for better because people should know that the game they're about to get does have bugs in it and was a little undercooked, I suppose.

64
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Well, and that's what the issue was last year, was the game was undercooked.

65
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I remember when it came out, it was very lacking content.

66
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And then on top of that $60 game, they wanted you to pay $50 for a season pass to get the rest of the maps that probably should have been the game in the first place.

67
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And some people were like, well, wait, why am I paying $110 for this game that was kind of just mediocre?

68
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And so now this comes out.

69
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And so what happened was people did math.

70
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So it started with a post on Reddit where some guy figured out about how many credits you get per match and how much that would take, how long it would take, how many matches you would need before you would get loot boxes and how many loot boxes.

71
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You can actually buy the characters directly as well, I think, or you can pay money to unlock certain things or you can try to gamble them in loot boxes.

72
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So they just calculated how long it would take to do that.

73
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And so originally it was like, okay, 40 hours to unlock.

74
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I think it was like 40 hours or 120.

75
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I don't remember now because they've switched it around so many times.

76
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
So a lot of hours, like 40 hours to unlock one character.

77
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I think to unlock everything was like over 120, 160 hours.

78
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,000
So just like an insane amount of time to, you know, that's in game playing matches and stuff.

79
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
So that's quite a bit.

80
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And then basically that, you know, a lot of people were just fucking pissed about that.

81
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
And so then I think EA kind of responded to one of the, you know, to that thread.

82
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And I got, you know, the massive downvotes, you know, making history as one of the most downvoted threads ever.

83
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
The most downvoted comment and not by a little bit.

84
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Yes, by several hundred thousand.

85
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
So, you know, people were very angry about that.

86
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:53,000
So EA kind of went back a little bit on it and they reduced the amount of the cost for those characters by 75%.

87
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
So it wouldn't take as long.

88
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Also with that, though, they forgot to mention that they also reduced the amount of credits that you get at the end of the game by completing the game by 75% as well.

89
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
And then other things kind of snuck its way in, like cooldowns for playing arcade mode.

90
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:22,000
So people have been showing that there's, you know, like a three hour cooldown, but I've seen other screenshots where it could be 14 hours or a day before you can earn more points in the offline multiplayer mode.

91
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
So if you didn't even want to play online, you just want to unlock characters to play offline.

92
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Yeah, good luck with it.

93
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So would it be correct to say that the problem overall, and I'm going to really try to generalize the feedback we're hearing on a large scale because there's always going to be outliers and extreme opinions one way or the other.

94
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:48,000
But it would be safe to say the general problem with this loot box issue is that it's not the fact that Battlefront has loot boxes, it's the way they were implemented.

95
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I think it's the way that they're implemented and that it seems very greedy.

96
00:08:51,000 --> 00:09:02,000
And it's just been kind of slowly ramping up with all these games coming out just recently even having loot boxes in them and very like almost like shoehorning them in there in different ways.

97
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Like with, you know, the whole Lord of the Rings game that came out that had that in there, the Shadow of War that kind of added those in last minute.

98
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:19,000
There was, you know, Call of Duty has been adding that stuff in there and it just seemed very out of place.

99
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And there was the whole controversy about having the, you know, the patent for the different ways that they're kind of trying to manipulate you into getting loot boxes.

100
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And even Battlefront kind of has that because, you know, when you finish the campaign, they could just unlock the character for you.

101
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:47,000
But no, they give you credits so that you have to go unlock a loot box so that you kind of get into that, ooh, you know, maybe I'll get something good or, you know, I could just buy this character outright or something like that.

102
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Even if you wanted the character or not, I don't know.

103
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Going to our chat room over at live.vog.network.com, Dungeonbuster who wrote those articles at VOG earlier this week actually is in our chat room commenting.

104
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,000
And I know his research has hit you well because his comments or his articles were very well sourced.

105
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Dungeonbuster says, the grind is still bad. Credit awards at the end of matches are still pretty terrible.

106
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
A player that doesn't contribute as much can earn as many credits as the MVP.

107
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Let's talk a little bit about what's kind of happened now.

108
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
So loot boxes were in there and then so there was feedback to say the least.

109
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
And so now EA has rolled back.

110
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,000
When I talk about feedback, though, I really quickly want to address because, you know, Jason kind of alluded to it in tonight's intro a little bit.

111
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
But there were obviously people on Twitter being shitty with death threats and things like that.

112
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Hold on with that.

113
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
So with that, there was a dev that was complaining they were getting death threats.

114
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And they came to find out Kotaku ran the whole thing on it.

115
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
That person wasn't actually a dev for EA.

116
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It was just trolling.

117
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
So not to say that people would make death threats because people make death threats over stupid shit.

118
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It's a really shitty thing.

119
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
But here's the thing, Loki.

120
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It's easy to believe because it's happened before.

121
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
So it's, you know, like people need to stop being shitty for one.

122
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:10,000
But I would like to think for the most part that is just an extremely vocal, extreme minority of consumers whose opinions, honestly, if you're going to resort to that, don't matter.

123
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I know you say we're the show where every gamer has a voice.

124
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
But if you're going to give death threats to people, not you, OK?

125
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
There's going to be a little asterisk by that.

126
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:30,000
The person that allegedly was on Twitter, they're not the people that are actually making these decisions.

127
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Obviously, it's not that.

128
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
OK, so outliers aside.

129
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
So they pulled back.

130
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
They basically said, we hear you.

131
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:48,000
We're going to go ahead and disable purchases of those game currencies temporarily while we evaluate and balance.

132
00:11:48,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Basically, their way of saving face to try to get people because there are some people that are easily forgive them and be like, oh, OK, well, they see they turned it off because they're not paying attention and they're going to go buy the game now.

133
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
That's what they were trying to do.

134
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And also because allegedly someone from Disney contacted EA said, what the fuck are you doing with Star Wars?

135
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And, you know, basically just trying that wasn't Dutch investor's second piece.

136
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It sounds like it was actually Bob Iger.

137
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
That's that's up and up at Disney.

138
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:27,000
So that's pretty alarming if, you know, Disney got into that feedback and actually made a nasty phone call to EA.

139
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,000
But like, I honestly like I was kind of interested in this game originally when they showed like, oh, the single there's a single player campaign now.

140
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
And I was like, oh, that's a really cool twist.

141
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
And I was kind of excited to get on board that.

142
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Not anymore.

143
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Not even a plan on picking it up because it's just it's such a mess.

144
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,000
And I don't want to give them money for this kind of shit because all of the publishers are starting to do this shit.

145
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
And it's not. And we can dog on EA, but it's Activision.

146
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It's Warner Brothers.

147
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It's take two.

148
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
They're all doing this shit and it's getting worse.

149
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:06,000
And I don't and I understand Bobby wants to defend them by saying, you know, development costs are going up for 4K graphics or whatever the case may be.

150
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
But. Yeah, you know what?

151
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I don't believe that.

152
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
And I think that a lot of this stems from I you know what?

153
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Yes, the cost may be going up.

154
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I don't think that's why they're doing it, though.

155
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Don't get me wrong.

156
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
They know they can make money off of it because they've been doing this stuff with their ultimate team in FIFA.

157
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,000
And don't give me this shit that they really improve the game every year, like polishing those graphics.

158
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Fuck, they do nothing to that shit.

159
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
OK, so they're making buku money off of this.

160
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:39,000
They've made they can see what the mobile market does and how people are spending money on this stuff.

161
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:48,000
And they're trying to integrate that into games because even Activision has said before they make more money off of in-game purchases than they do off the physical copies of their games.

162
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
So that's why they're doing these games as service stuff now, because they know they can make tons of money off of it.

163
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
And Battlefront 2.

164
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Yeah, it's got great graphics and stuff, but the game is buggy as shit.

165
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
And a lot of these games that are coming out are still like feel like early access titles that are being released.

166
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
So I don't buy for a second.

167
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:14,000
If we were getting like higher quality games that are even more fun, I might be able to just kind of say, OK, well, I don't mind paying a little extra for that.

168
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
But they're already paying extra from upfront with all these different collectors and loot boxes and additions and stuff like that.

169
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'm pre-paying for DLC now, which is basically, you know, these season passes.

170
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
And half the time the games come out and they're broken or buggy.

171
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Like look at the South Park game on PC. It was all fucked up just because rushed out.

172
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
So, OK, I agree with you and I don't agree with you.

173
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
And where I don't agree with you, I don't agree with you when you say that you don't believe that the games cost more to make.

174
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
They cost more to make, period.

175
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
There's stats to back that up, reports and how the industry is hiring. These companies are getting bigger.

176
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:59,000
And logically, to make a 4K video game, that is more artist hours to make a 4K texture.

177
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
That is going to be the case.

178
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:09,000
However, where I do agree with you is that I think this whole loot box thing is a case of it's worked well here.

179
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
So we're pushing it here and we're shoving it into this pigeonhole.

180
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Because we have found that we can make money off loot boxes.

181
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Like, you know, EA has gone on record saying that some Mass Effect 3 player spent like $15,000 legitimately not stolen on loot boxes.

182
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
So people will spend money on this shit.

183
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Do we show numbers that EA is actually hiring more artists?

184
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Are they paying them more money for this stuff?

185
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Are they paying them any sort of dividends for the sales of these games?

186
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Because the upfront costs of paying for these artists and stuff.

187
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I mean, look at Grand Theft Auto 4 or 5 or whatever.

188
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
They spent millions of dollars on that and they recouped that money in just the standard game sales alone.

189
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
And then now you have all this microtransactions you get from...

190
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Well, that's not so bad because it's just like DLC stuff.

191
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It's not like loot boxes and stuff yet.

192
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Well, yet, because I'm sure whatever they have cooked up for, you know, Red Dead 2 or something is going to be bad.

193
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
But they already have paid...

194
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
They've made so much money from this stuff already, recouped their money.

195
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I just don't believe that...

196
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Not all of these games that are costing $60 with these microtransactions in there are like these fantastic, incredible looking games.

197
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:32,000
They're just the same as the stuff that comes out from other companies that don't do this shit.

198
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Look at The Witcher 3.

199
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
The Witcher 3 is a fucking great looking game.

200
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Very well reviewed.

201
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Lots of detail in there.

202
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
High quality.

203
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Free DLC for the most part, I think.

204
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
They're able to make a profit just...

205
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
There is some paid DLC for Witcher, but it's expansive.

206
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
There's a lot of free stuff in there as well.

207
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
But they're able to make their money just fine.

208
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
So why is it that another company can't do it as well?

209
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
And I get it, you're paying for the Star Wars IP.

210
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
But no one said you had to make a Star Wars game.

211
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Let me ask a couple questions from your perspective, because here's my thing.

212
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Would you be angry if they were charging, just say, hey, five bucks to play as Vader in the store?

213
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Five bucks to do Vader, or five bucks to do...

214
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:28,000
In other words, instead of this loot box thing, just straight up a storefront that says it's straight up five bucks, ten bucks for these characters and these options.

215
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Would that offend you, the way the loot box thing is?

216
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I think it's a shitty practice, but that's what Capcom does with Street Fighter characters.

217
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Where did we go from DLC to loot boxes?

218
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
They can make more money.

219
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Because it's gambling.

220
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
It's gambling.

221
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,000
It's not technically gambling, but it's gambling because you're getting something random.

222
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
You don't know what you're getting, and a lot of times what you want is not what you're getting.

223
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
And so you're like, oh man, maybe the next time, and maybe the next time, and maybe the next time.

224
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:10,000
And it gets you in a cycle where you're spending more money than what it costs to buy the thing outright.

225
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
It's just like, you can look at an arcade, for example.

226
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
That's why they have crane games.

227
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Yes, you're gambling that you can get that stuffed animal out of there for a dollar,

228
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
instead of paying the price of whatever it was that you would pay for from some place.

229
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
So that's kind of the gamble there.

230
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
You don't know.

231
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I mean, obviously they have things working against you, but it's basically gambling.

232
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:41,000
You're taking a bet that you're going to put some money in there and get something really nice out, but it's not guaranteed.

233
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
And so people can get very addicted to that stuff.

234
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Well, okay, but all this stuff aside, so I want to be fair.

235
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I want to go to our chat room and read some other opinions here over at live.vognetwork.com.

236
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Bobby is talking a lot in our chat saying it takes an artist longer to make something in 4K than it does to make something in 1080 than it does to make something in SD.

237
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
So even if the artist makes the same amount per hour as they did before, they are spending more hours on each item.

238
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Witcher 3 was also made in Eastern Europe where they were able to pay the people less.

239
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
The devs there don't have as high of a salary as people in the US do.

240
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:19,000
That's where we outsource all of our developers when people don't want to pay for US devs, India and Eastern Europe.

241
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Let's see, other comments in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

242
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
JD in chat says, crane games at least still have skill as a factor.

243
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:31,000
They're not completely random, even if the odds are stacked against you because the crane has been weakened, etc.

244
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Dungeon Buster points out CD Projekt from Witcher 3 has GOG, which is sure to help with the bills.

245
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
To be fair, in this scenario, EA has Origin, so that cancels each other out, I suppose.

246
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
And they also have that stupid thing that you can purchase the service where you can play their games early,

247
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
and you pay that monthly fee, so they also have that backing them up as well.

248
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Which has been, in my opinion, has shot them in the foot this entire year because people are figuring this shit out because of that.

249
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Well, they're shoehorning this shit in all these games to either make them long, look at, even Need for Speed has this shit.

250
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Well, let me point out from SSG100Matt, EA has taken notice that their EA Sports games have made a boatload of money through their Ultimate Team mode in Madden, FIFA, and NHL games.

251
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
That mode is pretty much pay-to-win in the game.

252
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
EA has made more money in that game's loot boxes or cards than with the sale of the actual game.

253
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
EA has seen this and wants to incorporate it in all their games.

254
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:27,000
So, but, well, but now here's, has the ice broken on this?

255
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I mean, will there be an effect of this pushback?

256
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,000
And like, I even know people on Twitter who I would consider more casual gamers, but they're into Star Wars.

257
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I'm thinking of one friend of mine specifically, one of my old college buddies, was tweeting,

258
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I went into GameStop to cancel my pre-order for Battlefront 2 and referenced specifically the Ars Technica review.

259
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
That basically was like, nope, nope, nope, nope.

260
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:58,000
So he, he cancelled his pre-order and he said that the folks at GameStop supported him in his decision vocally.

261
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,000
So this whole, this whole thing, whether you like it, whether you agree with it or not,

262
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I think it's safe to say that this whole thing has backfired spectacularly with a game, you know, that is really important to EA right now.

263
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:20,000
And so EA has had to go full circle, full stop and basically, you know, take out the loot boxes at least for now or whatever they're doing.

264
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
We don't know what they're doing.

265
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
They've put out a statement that said the microtransactions are disabled.

266
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
We've heard the player feedback.

267
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
You just can't buy currency right now.

268
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Right.

269
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
But they're going to enable it later.

270
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Well, I would think what's going to happen, and this is just, you know, me speculating, I have nothing to base this on,

271
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:46,000
but EA is going to have to dial it back to cosmetics in the loot boxes and the currency because that's what works for Overwatch.

272
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
That's what works for a lot of the games that are out there now.

273
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:55,000
And they're going to have to put those unlockable characters and those things that give the in-game advantages like the ship speed and whatever, whatever those other things are.

274
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Those are going to have to be some type of earned in-game currency or something else.

275
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
They're going to have to dial that back to.

276
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:07,000
So I would fully expect that that the loot or excuse me, the EA thing will come back with two currencies.

277
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I don't think it will.

278
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I think all it's going to do is after some time, they're going to put them, enable them back in.

279
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
After it, you've already purchased the game.

280
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
You can't return anymore.

281
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
They're going to bring it back in.

282
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
So we will, we've evaluated and everything.

283
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
We balanced it.

284
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
They may tweak some of the values or whatever and then leave it as that.

285
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,000
And they're going to put it in there because they want, they want money.

286
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,000
They're going to say they justify it because they need to put out these additional maps or whatever that they're developing.

287
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Honestly, here's, here's my problem.

288
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
And I don't like people to excuse this crap.

289
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Whatever reason, Bobby, if he wants to say it's because they need money for development, other people, because they say it's only for cosmetics, you give them a fucking inch.

290
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
They're going to take it all.

291
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
And so this is what we have.

292
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
We've excused this ship for cosmetics now.

293
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
And look where it's gotten.

294
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Look at where it's gotten now.

295
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
It's just like these companies have been hell bent on doing this stuff.

296
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Like whether it's like driving a franchise into the ground by releasing tons of games in their Activision or by trying to do online passes, EA.

297
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
But has it, Loki?

298
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
That's the whole point, I think.

299
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Your, your argument, one, this is what's happened.

300
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
This is what's happened.

301
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:25,000
The, the, the, this is EA has failed this spectacularly on a, on a USA Today level stage where now everybody is reporting on this.

302
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I mean, this is this, this is the end game for that, right?

303
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
No, it's not.

304
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
It's going to get worse.

305
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:37,000
So you think even though EA has failed on this level and has had to dial this back, we're still going to get more of this?

306
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Yeah, it, I think this is, people are going to buy this game.

307
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:50,000
They're going to buy this game because, oh, you know, they're going to forgive them because it's Star Wars or there's going to be some shiny game down the road that they're going to want to buy.

308
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I think Red Dead Redemption could be a good indicator because Red Dead is going to definitely have some sort of online mode.

309
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
It's definitely going to have some sort of microtransactions in there.

310
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
They've already said they're going to do that.

311
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
That's a game that a lot of people can't resist.

312
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I can't resist that game because it's fucking Red Dead and I will buy it.

313
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,000
But that's the problem is like we're, they're going to find something that you want.

314
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:17,000
They're going to tweak it to find something that you want and then you're going to buy it and you're going to get stuck in this and the whole cycle is going to continue.

315
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
So all they're doing, they're not getting rid of it.

316
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
They're just tweaking their game of it.

317
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
All right, let's get to some comments in chat.

318
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Dungeon Buster says it will be back.

319
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:32,000
EA will lick its wounds and take baby steps such as when Ubisoft experienced its own backlash years ago as with AC Unity and its own push with Helix.

320
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Come on, Noel Gus says they just need to get out of the doghouse with Disney.

321
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
S. Jonah and Matt says loot boxes are sadly the present of multiplayer games.

322
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Dungeon Buster says other companies are looking at EA and taking notes on what not to do.

323
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:52,000
And Bobby says to Loki's point, Bethesda failed horribly with Horse Armor DLC.

324
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
That was the first time DLC was introduced.

325
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
DLC is commonplace now.

326
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
And look at what Bethesda is doing now with their paid mods.

327
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Thank you, Bethesda.

328
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
And they still haven't learned from their fucking lessons.

329
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Look, I just kind of think like it's not that I totally disagree with what you guys are saying.

330
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I think loot box kind of has to figure out where it fits in in this whole thing.

331
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:23,000
But I think at the end of the day, if you vote with your wallet, as clearly people did in this situation with canceled preorders and so forth and that type of negative press that got all the way to Bob Iger's eyes.

332
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
If you vote with your wallet, change is going to happen.

333
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
But enough people need to do that.

334
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
And that's hopefully what's going to happen this time.

335
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I don't think so.

336
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I think enough people are going to buy it where it's not going to make a difference.

337
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:43,000
So let me ask this because I think there's one other quote unquote solution we have to explore and I have to throw it out there.

338
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
And I kind of already think I know what you're going to say, but I'm going to throw it out there for the chat for everybody else.

339
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:55,000
One solution to this problem could be let's just allow companies to charge $70 for the games instead of 60 now.

340
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Let's just do that now.

341
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
No one's saying they can't do that.

342
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
It's just they would be suicide for their game if they did that.

343
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
So they have to hide it in different in preorder bonuses and golden.

344
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Wait, let me talk about why.

345
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Because I actually I'm surprised because I actually kind of agree with you.

346
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I'm not against companies raising the price of the game to $70, but because the expectation is going to be that it's going to be better than the other $60 games.

347
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
And that's not it's not going to be the case.

348
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
And then there's nothing no reason they can't do that.

349
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
But they already are doing it.

350
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Don't think for one second you're paying $60 for a game.

351
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
You haven't paid $60 for a game for years now.

352
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
You've been buying their fucking DLC passes and all this shit.

353
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
So you've been paying that additional money for the gold editions and stuff.

354
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Wait, what I'm going to do to you.

355
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I paid 60 bucks for Mario Odyssey.

356
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
That's been my best gaming experience all year and I haven't paid a penny more.

357
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Good.

358
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
You have one game that you did that for.

359
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Good for you.

360
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
How many amiibos did you buy?

361
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
How many amiibos have you bought?

362
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Yeah, that's DLC too.

363
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Your old pal Nintendo.

364
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
So did you buy an amiibo to dress up Mario in a special costume?

365
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Did you do that? Because I believe that's DLC.

366
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I got a physical figure with that too.

367
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
And Mario's never looked better.

368
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I'm just saying.

369
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Alright, you got me there.

370
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
You got me bitch.

371
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
But they're clever for doing that.

372
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Because at least you got something that you can justify.

373
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Okay, this is worth my money because of this reason.

374
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Alright, I got Loki to concede like an inch.

375
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
So I'll take it.

376
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I'm not saying it's wrong.

377
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
This is the problem.

378
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I don't have a problem with these companies doing these things.

379
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
My problem is they fuck shit up.

380
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Like you have a perfectly good game.

381
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
And then they just get greedy and then they fuck it up because of the greed.

382
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Like look at the Shadow of War.

383
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Perfect example.

384
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
It's like the whole Nemesis system and stuff is awesome.

385
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
And then they cheapen the whole thing by adding this loot box system in there

386
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
that doesn't need to be in there other than giving them more money.

387
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
How about this?

388
00:27:53,000 --> 00:28:00,000
If it's not financially feasible to release a game like X, then don't do it.

389
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Here's my take.

390
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Again, I'm not opposed to them raising the cost to $70.

391
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
However, where I think companies are going to struggle with this

392
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
is that they're going to have to justify a $70 cost for the game.

393
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
And that's kind of where I agree with you is that that better be worth it.

394
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:23,000
And the game is going to have to be something of that caliber that makes it worth the $70.

395
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Because if they don't, here's the other side of this.

396
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Sure, games can release for $70.

397
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Games can release for $60.

398
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
But we all know in the back of our head, and this has been true for how long,

399
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:38,000
we all know in the back of our head they're only going to be $60, $70 for a few months.

400
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
And then they go on sale.

401
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Here comes the Steam sale.

402
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Here comes the Black Friday sale.

403
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
There's so many of us that sit there and go, hmm, I'm not going to buy that game at $60.

404
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
But eventually, eh, it'll come down to $30.

405
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
And that's where, to the credit of the developers, the loot box thing is doing them well

406
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
because even though they have to end up slashing the price of the game,

407
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
those loot boxes never go on sale.

408
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
So they still make the same amount of money from that stuff with a whole new player base.

409
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Right, but if I'm paying $30 for a game and they have loot boxes in it,

410
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I might be more inclined to spend money on loot boxes than I would if I'm paying $60 for a game.

411
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Interesting.

412
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Because it's just like, okay, well, you're making your money from the loot boxes.

413
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:24,000
This is a very tricky question because if I were to say, what is the price of a video game?

414
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Would you just say, no matter what, $60?

415
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
No, it's whatever the game's worth.

416
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I mean, here's the thing.

417
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
The AAA industry can be as shitty as they want.

418
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
But in the end, they're not the only industry.

419
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
There's also the indie industry that's out there as well.

420
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
And you have indie games that make it big.

421
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Look at PUBG.

422
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
They have loot boxes in there as well, so they're not exempt from that.

423
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
But, I mean...

424
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
It's also, what, $30?

425
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
It's a $40 game.

426
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
It's insanely popular.

427
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,000
And it's a game I think would be popular longer than Star Wars Battlefront II.

428
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
There's other games out there.

429
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
So if this industry's being shitty, there's people that are going to be developing games out there

430
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
that are going to see them like, I'm not going to be a part of that fucking shit.

431
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I'm going to release a game for $30 or whatever, and it's going to be a good game.

432
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Because you have a lot of analysts and investors saying that this is the only type of game that's going to make money.

433
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
And they're doing it to please their investors.

434
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
They have to.

435
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
And so their investors want as much return as possible.

436
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
And that's why they're trying to make as much money as possible, which anybody's trying to do.

437
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:39,000
But at the same time, I feel that they're sacrificing quality in order to monetize in ridiculous ways.

438
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:45,000
And a lot of the things that we used to get included as part of the full package of a game is now being nickeled in time.

439
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,000
EA is always this purveyor of shitty services.

440
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:57,000
So EA, for example, one of the earliest things I remembered is they had the Godfather game.

441
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,000
It came out on PlayStation 2, Xbox, and also Xbox 360 and stuff like that.

442
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
PlayStation 2 and Xbox, cheat codes.

443
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Xbox 360, PlayStation 3.

444
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Those cheat codes are DLC that you have to pay for because they can make an extra buck off of it.

445
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Cheat codes have all but disappeared from our industry.

446
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,000
So it's all these tests to see what they can get away with and what they can charge for and what money can.

447
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
And if it's successful, then they're going to keep doing it.

448
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,000
If it's not successful, they're going to tweak it and pivot on it and see what other ways they can make money.

449
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,000
So Bobby Black Wolf, in response to the indie thing mentioned in our chat,

450
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
most people don't want to play a pixelated farm simulator, which is kind of an indie game.

451
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:45,000
If a casual person buys a 4K gaming system, they're not going to want to play a pixelated indie thing on it.

452
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Let me ask this question.

453
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:53,000
What if the game costs $60, but if you wanted 4K graphics to help pay for those artists

454
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:00,000
and up the costs and everything, how about you have to buy a 4K texture pack for 15 bucks?

455
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Do you think that would get this EA hate levels of tweet, or do you think that's a reasonable compromise?

456
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:14,000
No, it's not. And the reason why is that you basically just killed the Xbox One X and PlayStation 4 Plus.

457
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Because the game essentially costs more on those systems?

458
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Well, those systems could play the regular game. You just wouldn't get 4K without 15 bucks.

459
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:31,000
It's not. You can't do that. I don't know. It's shitty. We'll just have to see what happens.

460
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I mean, that's all we can do. I don't intend it. I don't think that...

461
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Nothing in the history of EA has ever said, oh, we've learned our lesson and we're not going to be shitty anymore.

462
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
It's, oh, we've learned our lesson, we can't be shitty this way, we're going to have to find another way to be shitty.

463
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,000
And that's how it is. And that's the constant battle that we have to deal with with these publishers.

464
00:32:51,000 --> 00:33:00,000
So that's what we're going to deal with once again. It's going to be, if this doesn't work out, they'll go away and something else will take its place.

465
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:06,000
It's what happened with the online passes. Whoa, we got to fight that used game industry, man. They are putting us out of business.

466
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:12,000
What is it? The game industry? Is it the fact that games are costing more? It's not making any fucking sense. Is it piracy?

467
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
You're going to blame piracy again, isn't it? It's just...

468
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:25,000
It is interesting to me that that whole issue seems to have been solved by the fact that a lot of these companies are convincing people to buy their games digitally.

469
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:31,000
And you can't really resell a digital game. So that kind of worked out, didn't it?

470
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Well, it also doesn't help that games, it's a hassle to do that. And it's a lot of times, like, it's fun to have that large library of games because now they're giving you all these free games and stuff.

471
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:49,000
But it doesn't really bother me that I can't sell the game back anymore because I end up playing it, I may play it down the road later on or something like that.

472
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:58,000
It doesn't take up any space in my house, so it's not a big deal. It's just out there in the cloud digitally somewhere and I can always redownload it later on until they shut down whatever service it is.

473
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:05,000
But so that doesn't really bother me. I never thought I would be buying games mostly digitally, but I am.

474
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:16,000
But yes, that would stop used sales a bit. But I don't think that was really a big deal in the first place. It was just an excuse.

475
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:22,000
This is why they wanted to blame Redbox for the fact that their games weren't selling. No, it's not the case.

476
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:30,000
To me, the used game thing kind of is in that same bucket with if your game is worth $60, people buy the $60 to get it new, or they just wait for it to go on sale.

477
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,000
And the used game kind of falls in that bucket where they'll wait to buy the used.

478
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Or make your game so that it's fully-

479
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
But if the game is really good, you can't find a used copy anywhere because people don't sell it.

480
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Or just make sure your game is good when it comes out and not fucking buggy as shit so you have to patch it later on because a lot of games get rushed out.

481
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:54,000
And that's another reason people wait is because they're like, fuck that, I'm not buying Assassin's Creed, that's going to be buggy as shit.

482
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
I won't wait until they patch that shit, and they'll buy it later.

483
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:03,000
One more question I have, and then I swear we're going to move on because we need to get off this topic because it's been consuming everything for a couple weeks.

484
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
And there's a lot of other things to talk about.

485
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
But one more question. And I kind of feel like you're already going to say no.

486
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:18,000
But do you think that there will be any fallout at EA's executive level for what's happened this year?

487
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
With Star Wars being at the forefront of that, Mass Effect to a lesser extent.

488
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Because from my perspective, I'm sitting here as somebody who is a Mass Effect fan, looking at Bioware having to take the hit for what happened with Mass Effect.

489
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
DICE having to take the hit, because that apology came from DICE, it didn't come from EA.

490
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:42,000
And I'm kind of sitting here going, when's EA's board going to take some fucking ownership here?

491
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,000
So my question is, is anybody at EA going to have to take a hit for what's happened this year?

492
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
No, because this is all part of their calculation.

493
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:55,000
They're just basically saying, okay, right now we're going to take a hit now, but we're going to make it up on the back end when we reintroduce this stuff.

494
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
And we're going to spice it up somehow, we're going to introduce new characters.

495
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Because right now, when people are calculating how long it's going to take to grind these different characters, it was based off of what is currently in existence.

496
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Who says that that's all that there's going to be? They're going to add characters to that.

497
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:21,000
So I don't think it's going to be, and they've even said in their investor meetings or calls or whatever, that it's not going to affect anything.

498
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
At least that's what they're saying right now.

499
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:34,000
And I'm worried that, yeah, that's probably going to be the case, because people will buy the game eventually, and they'll forgive them and forget, and then the next game will come out, and this whole shit will happen again.

500
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
What was the other thing I was going to say?

501
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:44,000
So speaking of EA as a publisher, you may know that there's slim margins in video games and game stores.

502
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Guess who charges the most for their games out of all of the AAA publishers?

503
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:56,000
That's right, it's EA. They charge a $1.25 a piece extra over most of the other companies out there.

504
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Interesting.

505
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Take-Two is also another one that charges a good amount.

506
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
But the Take-Two's games always sell like banana bonkers.

507
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
They do.

508
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
So that's how they do it.

509
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Activision.

510
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Look at Star Wars, the movie, going into movie theaters.

511
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:16,000
The demands from Disney to the movie theaters for playing Episode VIII are huge.

512
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Like, a read about that out there is that there's some smaller theaters in some smaller markets that are refusing to play it, because they're not going to play by Disney's rules.

513
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
So that's interesting.

514
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Well, Disney's a whole other...

515
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Talk about evil organizations, I mean, jeez.

516
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Well, I mean, they're kind of a part of this too, in a way.

517
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
They may have been the one to ultimately end or stop what's going on here.

518
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
But anyway, let's move on. We've got a lot to talk about.

519
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
So, let's see. Other stuff I want to get into.

520
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I do want to get into our gaming week.

521
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:52,000
But before we get into our gaming week, I should acknowledge that we are taping our show today on 19 November.

522
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Which is somewhat of a, and I'm going to use my quotey fingers, holiday for enthusiasts of music games.

523
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Specifically, Konami's Bomani music series.

524
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Which really, you know, is what we owe the fact, because it's how Yuumi, Dark Sakura, how the three of us all met, and really formed OLR, was because we always used to play Dance Dance Revolution at Golf Land.

525
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:20,000
And, if you didn't know, the reason why it's 19 November or 20 November is that 20 November was a song that was in the very first, I think, BeatMania game.

526
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
They crossed over, they did like a dance remix that was in Dance Dance Revolution.

527
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:32,000
And then somewhere along the way around, like BeatMania 6 style 2DX, they had a 19 November, which I guess is a prequel.

528
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,000
I don't know what you want to call it, but it's basically like another song that has a very specific call out date in it.

529
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:47,000
So that's why a lot of Bomani enthusiasts celebrate, and I'm using my quotey fingers, 19 November and 20 November is kind of like the official Bomani weekend or what have you.

530
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:53,000
So, I'm just curious, when was the last time you, like, played a game out of that series?

531
00:38:53,000 --> 00:39:01,000
I actually got to play pop and music this last weekend. I was in San Francisco, I went to a show yesterday, actually Dark Sakura met me there, which was really cool.

532
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:07,000
But we actually went to, I went to Japantown, and they have that little arcade there, and they have two pop and music machines.

533
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:13,000
So I was actually able to play pop and music yesterday, which was funny because I failed spectacularly on the first song.

534
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Because I was like, oh, I think I can play songs about this level, and I did terrible.

535
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:24,000
And then I dropped it down just a little bit, and it was like, oh, okay, it's like slowly coming back to me, and I can play the nine button pop and music.

536
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Which is, if you don't know what pop and music is, it's a music game, but imagine the game of trouble with the pop-o-matic bubble, that big bubble you hit.

537
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Imagine there's nine of those in a line, or in a staggered line, and that's what you use to control the game.

538
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:42,000
And it's really a lot of fun to watch, because it looks ridiculous, but it's a lot of fun.

539
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
And what was the last time you touched any of that stuff?

540
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:53,000
I don't remember. Last time I played, I think, I remember playing DDR at one of my son's birthday parties that he went to.

541
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,000
And that was painful.

542
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
It's hard to play DDR now.

543
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
It's not in shape anymore.

544
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Looking in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Dark Tetsuya points out that 20 November is also DJ Nagarayo, who is the composer of that, as his birthday.

545
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
So, that was the tie-in for that.

546
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
So, there you go.

547
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
So, 19 November is pre-game day or something like that.

548
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Yeah, is it birthday eve?

549
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Birthday eve.

550
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Alright, maybe that was good, because Good Cool did not, maybe Good Cool's birthday was 19 November, I don't know.

551
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Alright, anyway.

552
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
So, I just wanted to give a shout-out and acknowledge that.

553
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

554
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Loki, what have you been up to?

555
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
So, I haven't played a whole ton of stuff.

556
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:45,000
I almost bought Skyrim VR, but then I was like, it's $60 and it's Skyrim again.

557
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
How many times am I going to buy this game?

558
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,000
So, I haven't purchased it yet, and I'm probably going to hold off.

559
00:40:51,000 --> 00:41:00,000
I may get it on PC if I ever get a VR headset for PC that's of any, you know, if it's decent or whatever.

560
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:13,000
But, I have been playing LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2, and I mainly just unlock characters for my kids so that they can play the free mode and stuff like that whenever I finish the game.

561
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Honestly, I'm kind of getting bored of these games.

562
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:26,000
They used to have a funny storyline and good voice acting and stuff, and it seems like the voice acting has really gone downhill since the first one.

563
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Like, the first one had some really great voice actors in there.

564
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Now, it's like they've changed all the voices out again.

565
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I don't really like it the way that they've kind of done it.

566
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
And the humor is kind of just, eh, it's alright.

567
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:47,000
The one thing that's positive about it is they've kind of increased the number of boss fights that are in there, and there are some pretty interesting boss fights.

568
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:52,000
The problem also with that, though, is it's a game definitely geared towards kids.

569
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:59,000
So the bosses, you can really see, they basically highlight projecting where the boss is going to attack next.

570
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:04,000
And there's really no difficulty to it anyways, because if you die, you just keep respawning.

571
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:10,000
You just lose the studs in the game, which is kind of like the in-game currency to unlock characters.

572
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Although, the characters I have already are already unlocked.

573
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,000
But later on, you get characters and you have to unlock them with studs that you collect in the game.

574
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:29,000
But the storyline's alright. I mean, they've kind of focused it around the Guardians of the Galaxy, but then now it's kind of getting more into just comic book stuff.

575
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Like, they have Kang the Conqueror is the big villain in the game.

576
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,000
And I'm not too familiar with him, aside from one of the books that my kids have.

577
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:44,000
There's a story in this Marvel book that I read to them that has Kang the Conqueror in it, and he's this time traveler guy.

578
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Apparently he has a giant sword-shaped ship or something.

579
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:54,000
But then there's this weird time travel shit, and there's all these characters in Marvel Universe. I have no fucking clue who they are.

580
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
But the puzzles are just getting very easy, and it's just... I don't know.

581
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,000
It's not as entertaining as it was before. Now, they've played through several of these games.

582
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:11,000
It just kind of gets very formulaic, like, okay, I know what to do now. There's no puzzle solving or actual difficult fights.

583
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:20,000
It's just trudging through it. The other day I was literally falling asleep playing the game, and somehow I beat the boss because I was falling asleep.

584
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I was just hitting the button, and I was like, ah, I'm just going to keep punching him.

585
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:29,000
It didn't matter because if I died, I'd just respawn and keep punching him. There's no penalty for that.

586
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Which is fine. That's for kids. I get it. But it would be nice if adults do play these games, too.

587
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,000
It would be kind of cool if they kind of catered it a little bit towards everybody.

588
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:45,000
You just don't dumb it down because it's just kids you're playing. You can have a kid mode in there or something like that.

589
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:58,000
What else? Actually, aside from that, I was playing also Lego Batman 2 DC Super Heroes.

590
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,000
That one's actually an older game, but I've been playing that on my PC, and that one's all right.

591
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:09,000
But, you know, at least that one's sort of funny, and the voice acting is much better because it's one of the earlier games.

592
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:15,000
So they have the Batman TV series of voice actors and stuff like that, so that's kind of cool.

593
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Aside from Batman, I still have a lot of VR games I've been meaning to play.

594
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:26,000
I just haven't gotten around to it because my wife's been hogging the TV with friends, and so it would be very difficult for me to set up.

595
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Usually I set up one of our dining room chairs to sit on so that the camera can pick the move controllers up very well.

596
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Our couch is just outside of the good area for detection of that stuff.

597
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
You can't just turn the camera a little bit and fix that?

598
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,000
I'd have to move it forward. I don't know. It's really silly.

599
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:54,000
So I just haven't been able to do that yet. I've got like four or five games, PlayStation VR games, that I need to get into.

600
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,000
So I'm hoping over the break I'll get to actually do that.

601
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:05,000
And then I've been putting off getting South Park. I may get that at some point because it looks good.

602
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:11,000
And I do want Skyrim VR. We'll see how well I can hold out.

603
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:17,000
It's Skyrim. I've played so many hours in it. I don't want to start all over again.

604
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:23,000
I don't know. They have to really add something new to it. That's what I wanted to do on PC. Mods.

605
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Kai, should I also suggest for your camera usage, get a tripod. It fixes a lot of that stuff.

606
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Well, it's just sitting on top of the TV. I don't know if it really needs the tripod.

607
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:38,000
But once again, if I did all that, it'd be in front of the TV. Wife can't watch TV.

608
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,000
And then she'll be bored and then I'll have to hear about it and I don't want to hear about it.

609
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Repeatedly.

610
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:50,000
It's like you have Netflix. You can watch it on your computer because that's what I do if I want to watch something.

611
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
No. No.

612
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Alright. My gaming week. Not a lot of new stuff this week because I'm continuing to play Mario Odyssey.

613
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,000
That was a great thing to play on the plane. I actually brought my Switch and was playing it on the plane.

614
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:11,000
My son keeps bugging me to get a Switch and get Mario Odyssey. It's $400. I can't spend $400 for Mario Odyssey right now.

615
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Well, hopefully the system will come down.

616
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Yes, I need a man cave. We have very few. We have one bathroom.

617
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
A response to our comment live.

618
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:30,000
I do need a man cave. I have the garage but it smells like cat box and it's cold or super hot.

619
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:35,000
I've also been playing Heroes of the Storm. I'm still going on that plane regularly.

620
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:42,000
My cell phone gaming. My AR gaming between Ingress and Pokemon Go because Ingress has double AP right now which is a big deal.

621
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:47,000
By the way, Loki, if you haven't signed in, make sure you sign in and get the free thing in the store because it's a free key locker and it's a bonus.

622
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
So now you can have six key lockers.

623
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Hooray! I will do that now.

624
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Even if you don't plan on playing regularly, you'll kick yourself if you don't grab that while you can.

625
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Or for anybody out there who plays it, if you haven't played in a while, go in their currency because you get a free pack for the anniversary that has one fracker, one beacon, and a new key capsule that's like a black and red pattern.

626
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,000
So yeah, check that out.

627
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,000
So with double AP, I've been playing a little bit more of that, though not a ton.

628
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:21,000
You haven't heard about the whole other twist. They did another twist in Ingress where one player now can deploy only for this anniversary event.

629
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:27,000
One player can deploy 8, 8, 7, 7 on a portal as opposed to 1, 8, and 1, 7.

630
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:35,000
And I know people that don't follow Ingress may not understand that but basically it allows you to make a portal of a higher level, a level 6 portal, by yourself.

631
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,000
And it only takes 4 people, as opposed to 8 people, to make the highest level portal.

632
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:45,000
So there's more level 8 portals popping up all over the place, which is kind of fun.

633
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
So anyway, that's in short what's happening in Ingress.

634
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Pokemon Go, I know we're going to get to it a little bit later, but they just announced another event today.

635
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:55,000
And I don't know if I mentioned this on the show, but I had a Pokemon Go Plus.

636
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:00,000
And it was working fine, but it was having issues on iOS 11 that I was reading about online.

637
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
And I got to play with Alan, has this thing called a Gotcha.

638
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
I think I did mention this on the show.

639
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Yeah, it's basically the thing I was saying.

640
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,000
John from Critical Myth actually tagged me on Facebook saying he got one because he heard me talking about it.

641
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:19,000
And I got to say, the Gotcha, even though it's very third party or what have you, it does work really well.

642
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:24,000
I mean, some people might think, well, isn't the thrill gone if that thing catches everything for you?

643
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
And my answer is yes and no.

644
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:36,000
If I want to incentivize my walking, the Gotcha is very good for that because I get stats on my egg and so forth and so forth.

645
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:43,000
But if I want to catch certain Pokemon or go to a farm part of town or something where we know a certain Pokemon spawns,

646
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
I don't think the Gotcha or the Pokemon Go Plus or any of that is very good for it.

647
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:51,000
You do want to play the game in your hand and actually manually do the catches because with these devices,

648
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,000
you throw one ball at the Pokemon and either you catch it or you don't.

649
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:00,000
So the Gotcha or the Pokemon Go Plus, it's great for catching Pidgeys and Spinaraks and shit that's everywhere,

650
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,000
but it's not going to help you catch stuff that's a little more rare.

651
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,000
So I wouldn't really use it for those types of scenarios.

652
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,000
But anyway, so I've been using that to play a little more of that.

653
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
And then here's the storm.

654
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Diablo with the new season that just started.

655
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:24,000
And I reupped my subscription to World of Warcraft.

656
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
I thought, oh, let's see what's been going on in there.

657
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,000
It's been a long time since I played, so I haven't quit 14 or anything.

658
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,000
It's just kind of a lull right now on 14 and not really a lot of content.

659
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Not a lot of people that I know have been playing lately, so there hasn't been a whole lot of people to be doing stuff with.

660
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:47,000
But I'm keeping it open just because if somebody does say like, hey, Rob, let's go do a dungeon, I can do that.

661
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,000
But I'm kind of flirting with WoW a little bit, just kind of seeing what's changed and what's different.

662
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
So there's that.

663
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
I guess we all knew it would happen eventually.

664
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
This tends to happen once a year, by the way.

665
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
I'll reup WoW for a month, maybe two, and then I'll cancel it.

666
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:05,000
So that'll probably be what happens here again, but it's my annual revisit to that game.

667
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,000
So that's pretty much it for my gaming week.

668
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Before we get into news this week, I should announce here on the show because this little thing is at my feet right now.

669
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:24,000
So you guys know that Alan and I had a kitty that Sanrio passed away a few weeks ago.

670
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
It was probably close to a month now.

671
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:31,000
And obviously we've been really wanting to get a new cat just because even though our old cats can never be...

672
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:35,000
I say cats because we had another one, Maruko, a few years ago, and he passed.

673
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:40,000
But even though we can never replace those cats, we knew we had to get something.

674
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
We had to get a new little furball friend.

675
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,000
So we actually have a new kitty.

676
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:52,000
And he doesn't have a name yet, but I keep calling him Mr. Smoosh just because he has a little smooshy face.

677
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
He's one of those cats that has a smooshy face.

678
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:59,000
And Mr. Smoosh is much more social than Sanrio or the other cats were.

679
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
So he's actually out here in the studio right now just chilling.

680
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,000
He was napping up on the couch earlier and Loki...

681
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
His face kind of looks like Yoda.

682
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Does it?

683
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
A little bit.

684
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:13,000
There's pictures on my Twitter at Skye, S-K-I-E, if you want to see pictures here.

685
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
But, oh, he's great.

686
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:20,000
And so the interesting thing is usually you don't find smooshfoot face cats as rescues.

687
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
They're usually cats that you breed, right?

688
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:28,000
And we're very big... Al and I are very big on we only want to do rescue cats because we want to help cats at home.

689
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:35,000
But a friend on Facebook posted about this cat that her friend had found, I guess this cat...

690
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Somebody abandoned this cat in the apartment complex.

691
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,000
And the cat was just kind of walking around outside for a couple weeks.

692
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,000
So somebody took him in, tried taking him to the vet.

693
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,000
They read the chip. The numbers on the chip were disconnected.

694
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,000
So they can't get in touch with whoever owned and left this cat.

695
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,000
I worry somebody moved out in that apartment complex and left the cat there.

696
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Because you know how people do that sometimes, which is really shitty.

697
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
But we kind of think that's probably what happened with this cat.

698
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,000
So it ended up being that we could rescue a cat.

699
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Who would have abandoned such a beautiful cat?

700
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,000
This is like a show cat. I don't understand.

701
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
But Al and I are going to take real good care of him.

702
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
And we'll pick a long-term name at some point.

703
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Although I have a feeling this Mr. Smoosh is going to stay.

704
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,000
I'm surprised they didn't have the name on the chip. Sometimes they put the name on the chip itself.

705
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Yeah, we didn't hear anything about that.

706
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
We're going to take it into our vet and have the chip read again.

707
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
If the chip is still in there, I imagine it is.

708
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:29,000
We're going to have the chip read again just to make sure everything is being accounted for.

709
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,000
And then if there is a name on there, then we'll decide.

710
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
It's kind of up to us if we want to keep it or not.

711
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Right, yeah. Because I know when I registered our cat, we had to put the name on there.

712
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,000
So I think it had it. But maybe, I don't know.

713
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Dark Tetsuya in chat says, listless name the cat. Hell no.

714
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
That is a big hell no.

715
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
I love the idea though. That's great.

716
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Alright, so anyhow.

717
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,000
So Mr. Smoosh is now the unofficial co-host of our show.

718
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,000
You want to come say hello? He's not very talkative.

719
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:10,000
He's only talkative when he whines and wants food.

720
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Anyway, alright.

721
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
No, I don't think Mr. Smoosh is going to talk.

722
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
You want to say something Mr. Smoosh?

723
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,000
He's rubbing up on the microphone.

724
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,000
I think with the voice card though, it probably isn't coming through.

725
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Yeah, he was very vocal earlier when I had chicken in here.

726
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
He was like, you're going to give me some of that?

727
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Leroy.

728
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Alright. Anyhow, let's get into some other gaming news.

729
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,000
What else is going on in the game industry this week? Loki.

730
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,000
It's just all loot boxes, right?

731
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
I think there is other stuff. Loot boxes is distracting us from everything else.

732
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
That's all anybody can talk about.

733
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
It's just so like, I don't know.

734
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:50,000
It's been just, if it's not reading about loot box stuff, it's reading about...

735
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Let's loot box the news.

736
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Loot box the news.

737
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
That's what we'll do. We're going to put, in the future for the kickoff topic,

738
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
we're going to put three news articles in boxes,

739
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
and we're going to open one loot box and see what...

740
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,000
I love loot boxes in Borderlands or in Diablo,

741
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,000
where they're like in the game, not where I had to purchase them.

742
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:14,000
So anyways, speaking of games, Overwatch.

743
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:19,000
So there's been an issue with Overwatch where accounts are getting suspended

744
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:24,000
and banned due to false reports, I guess.

745
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:33,000
And so one of these situations is actually there was a person playing a match.

746
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
It was actually...

747
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Felix Lengel was playing, I guess, a competitive Overwatch match

748
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
when he was booted from the game

749
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:48,000
and informed that his account had been banned or suspended.

750
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,000
And I guess he was mid-match when that occurred,

751
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,000
and so that kind of sucked.

752
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Apparently though, this also happened during the Overwatch World Cup

753
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:04,000
when a Canadian player also had that happen as well.

754
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,000
So apparently after the ban was issued,

755
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,000
he found out that, I guess, the email was saying that

756
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:18,000
there was an offensive misused reporting system or something like that

757
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:23,000
that they had issued it only after careful review of evidence.

758
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:32,000
And the message specified that it referred to other players reporting him

759
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
that prevented him from playing.

760
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:39,000
And I guess the thing is now people like doing these false reports.

761
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
At least it's not swatting, so let's step up from that.

762
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
But it still sucks that people are reporting.

763
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,000
I have a feeling they're watching these streams of people playing competitively

764
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:51,000
and saying, aha, we're going to troll that guy by reporting him or something.

765
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
He's cheating or something.

766
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Shouldn't there be some type of backlash

767
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000
where if this gets Blizzard's attention

768
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,000
and they can even provide the footage or whatever and the proof,

769
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,000
couldn't Blizzard go back and basically make these people

770
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,000
unable to report accounts ever again because they abused the system?

771
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Maybe. Or can they easily create new Blizzard accounts?

772
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Maybe. They'd have to re-buy Overwatch.

773
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Well, free play weekend though maybe is, I don't know.

774
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Was it a free play weekend?

775
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
When this happened, I don't think it was.

776
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
But right now is a free play weekend in Overwatch.

777
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
I was just thinking like, oh, it would be easy to make new accounts.

778
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
But I don't know, maybe free players don't get to report

779
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:38,000
or have their reports mean as much as somebody who's a paying customer.

780
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
I don't know. Blizzard's still having to work all that out

781
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,000
and they claim it's taking away from development of the actual game because of it.

782
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Woohoo, okay. I mean, I don't feel bad for them.

783
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
It is a big deal.

784
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
I'm okay with them taking the time to get this right.

785
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
You want the community to be positive.

786
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
And it is a big deal because he is a professional player.

787
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:59,000
He's on one of the Blizzard teams, the Dallas Fuel.

788
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Sounds like a Mountain Dew brand or something like that.

789
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Dallas Fuel. But whatever the case may be.

790
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:12,000
So he's got his team, at least the people managing that are looking into it as well.

791
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,000
I'll try to see if Blizzard can kind of correct that.

792
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:19,000
But it's still shitty that this is going to be a thing.

793
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Especially, that's got to hurt too.

794
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Like if it's happening, at least this was at home.

795
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
But like, couldn't the same thing happen?

796
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Like say, add a match in an arena or something like that?

797
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Or just false reporting these people?

798
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
I don't know.

799
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:41,000
You would think that there would be some way to figure that out.

800
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:45,000
But how are you going to, without truly investigating these things.

801
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,000
I don't know what proof they have.

802
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
We won't know because only Blizzard can see that.

803
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Right.

804
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
So, I don't know if there's an easy answer to this.

805
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,000
But it's probably going to impact the way that you do reporting in one way or another.

806
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:04,000
I guess there's probably not going to be any automated bans when a ton of people report a certain individual.

807
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Which actually could end up being a bad thing.

808
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Because that could affect people that are spamming or people that really are toxic that do need to go.

809
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Either way, they should always have humans looking at that stuff.

810
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Yeah. Wherever they can.

811
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Alright, well one thing that many humans and gamers in the gaming community are looking at over the next couple weeks is the Game Awards.

812
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:28,000
You know, it's been taking a very long time for somebody to get Game Awards right in this industry.

813
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:34,000
But we do have the nominees out for the Game Awards 2017.

814
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:42,000
And also news that some big reveals and secrets are going to be coming for the Game Awards from a number of developers and publishers.

815
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,000
13 plus reveals. I don't know what the plus means.

816
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:49,000
But some of these will be Switch titles, undoubtedly.

817
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Nintendo's done a lot with Game Awards before those, so that's not too surprising to hear.

818
00:58:53,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Maybe DLC Pack 2 will be part of the announcement, which was supposed to be out in November.

819
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,000
But I don't think that's happening at this point because November's almost done.

820
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
And they still haven't announced anything with this.

821
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:10,000
And I think the Game Awards are what on the... What day is it?

822
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Let's see, the Game Awards is December 7th.

823
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Okay, there you go. I knew it was like the first week in December.

824
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Oh, by the way, speaking of Nintendo, Bobby Blackwolf in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

825
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Animal Crossing Pocket Camp has a release date November 22nd on American App Stores.

826
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Oh, thank you for your money. That was something that I was playing.

827
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Which is on the Australian store.

828
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Yes, I played it. I am bored to death with that game, so I will not be playing it.

829
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
What's wrong with it?

830
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:41,000
It's just boring. It's Animal Crossing, but boring.

831
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
You just kind of wore it out? You weren't into it?

832
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:49,000
I'm not even engaged. It's just not engaging enough for me.

833
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:54,000
There's not really any... I don't know. I just don't feel the need to play it.

834
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Alright.

835
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:59,000
I don't know, but whatever. I mean, I'm sure other people will like it.

836
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
I was going to mention, though, there's some of the nominees.

837
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:07,000
I was just about to get to it, too. Game of the Year. That's the only one anybody cares about, right?

838
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Game of the Year is Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild. No surprise there.

839
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Super Mario Odyssey. No surprise there.

840
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,000
PUBG. No surprise there, really.

841
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Horizon Zero Dawn. Not a huge surprise.

842
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
And Persona 5. Also not a huge surprise.

843
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:29,000
So, that list of nominees, pretty much... I mean, you can't really look at any of those games and say those don't deserve to be there.

844
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:35,000
There's no Battlefront 2 or no Call of Duty or no...

845
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
EA games. No EA games.

846
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,000
No Shadow of War?

847
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,000
How do you feel about two Nintendo games, Loki?

848
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:47,000
I think they were great games. I don't see a problem with them being on there at all.

849
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Like, do we think that I hate Nintendo? Like, I don't understand what the problem is.

850
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Sometimes, yes.

851
01:00:55,000 --> 01:01:01,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Andrade with VoGnetwork.com, use the passphrase, call.

852
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:06,000
BlobbyBlackWolf in chat says, PUBG is still in early access.

853
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,000
So, you know, I guess maybe some would wonder, does PUBG deserve to be there?

854
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:18,000
That is a little weird, but I mean, it's not like we're talking about Game of the Year being, you know, Nintendo's online.

855
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Because that's certainly not going to get voted Game of the Year or anything of the year.

856
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,000
You're shifting the conversation away from PUBG.

857
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Why is PUBG in the Game of the Year if it's still in early access?

858
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Well, I mean, it's hard to deny the effect that game has had on the gaming industry, and I think that's why it's there.

859
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,000
You know, that game has basically taken over Twitch.

860
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:40,000
And now we see, even if it is in early access, it already has imitators, right?

861
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Why is this a category? Best ongoing game?

862
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Oh, like, is that where, like, Overwatch and stuff is nominated for stuff like this?

863
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Yeah, like Overwatch and Destiny 2. Yeah, it's ongoing. It just came out, like, two months ago.

864
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
What, is that, like, an online game?

865
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Yeah, Overwatch didn't. Overwatch was the game of the year last year.

866
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Oh, right. Overwatch didn't. The rest of the categories make sense.

867
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Like Rainbow Six Siege and, you know, Grand Theft Auto Online, that type of stuff, Warframe.

868
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:12,000
I assume they just want to acknowledge developers that have kept supporting their game a long time after release.

869
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Well, how congratulations to Bungie for supporting their games two months after launch.

870
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Props to them, man. I know that's such a struggle.

871
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:26,000
I do like, they have Best Student Game. That's kind of cool. Trending Gamer.

872
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:32,000
What do you think about the most, I did think it's really cool, they have that guy from Games Done Quick.

873
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
In the game, he'll win.

874
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
What, Trending Gamer?

875
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Yeah, my money's on Dr. Disrespect, but, you know.

876
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Of course it is.

877
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Alright, for the record, I don't know that guy. I just, I hear the name.

878
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
What do you think of this category?

879
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Thank you, it's half coordinated was the name I was thinking of. Thank you, Dr. Z.

880
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
What do you think of this category?

881
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Most Anticipated Game.

882
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:02,000
God of War, Spider-Man, Monster Hunter World, Red Dead Redemption 2, and The Last of Us Part 2.

883
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
What do you think of that category?

884
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Brought to you by Sony.

885
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
I mean...

886
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,000
What do you think? Hype. Nothing but hype category.

887
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Best Hype.

888
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:17,000
It's a dumb category, but Red Dead 2, all the way.

889
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Of course.

890
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
I'm biased, so...

891
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Of those five for game of the year, which do you think will win and should win?

892
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Mario Odyssey for both?

893
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Okay, I think Breath of the Wild will win.

894
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:39,000
And it really, really not that it shouldn't win, but my vote would go to Mario Odyssey.

895
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
I think Mario Odyssey for both.

896
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,000
The thing that's a little weird about that is that...

897
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Will the fact that there's two Nintendo games in there kind of cancel each other out?

898
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Like, are they going to split the vote?

899
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
No, I don't think so.

900
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:56,000
I think Breath of the Wild's been out long enough that people have kind of forgotten about it.

901
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,000
To where Mario Odyssey is going to be more fresh in people's minds.

902
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:03,000
I think it's going to get the vote because it's so much nostalgia thrown in there.

903
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Whereas Breath of the Wild is like, wow, this is a really new direction for Zelda.

904
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:13,000
This is more like, wow, it's so innovative and fun to play, and all the nostalgia, and oh, it's so colorful and cute.

905
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
And yeah, everybody's talking about it.

906
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Really? I mean, I could just see a scenario where they go out there and they go,

907
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
It's a tie!

908
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,000
And both games win and let the Nintendo orgy begin.

909
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:28,000
It's Horizon Zero Dawn in Persona 5.

910
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Alright.

911
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Let's move on with some more news. Logi.

912
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Yeah, so...

913
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Apparently, Disney has dropped out of Marvel Heroes.

914
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:50,000
So, they've cut their ties with Gazillion, and that's caused the online game, Marvel Heroes, to shut down.

915
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
That's kind of unfortunate.

916
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,000
So basically, they had an email that went out that said,

917
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:01,000
We regret to inform our Marvel Heroes fans that we have ended our relationship with Gazillion Entertainment,

918
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,000
and that Marvel Heroes games will be shut down.

919
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:08,000
We would like to sincerely thank you, the players who have joined Marvel Heroes community,

920
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,000
and will provide any updates as they become available.

921
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:18,000
And of course, that was out on PC, and then they had console ports on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,

922
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,000
which I never did play, but I know those are free to play.

923
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Oh well, guess I won't be playing that.

924
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Of course...

925
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,000
I feel like I played this one for a half second.

926
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Not a lot of people were happy about that.

927
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:35,000
And some of those include people, once again, that were paying money via microtransactions.

928
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:41,000
So there was a guy that said he'd sunk $400 in the microtransactions, unlocking different characters,

929
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:47,000
and now we're worried that money is all gone, or now the service is going away.

930
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
I kind of...

931
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,000
You know, I don't know if I really excuse that.

932
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Yeah, you can be mad about it, and they're demanding refunds,

933
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:00,000
but it's an online game that's free to play.

934
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,000
There's no guarantee that things are going to stay around forever.

935
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,000
I just, you know...

936
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,000
I don't know.

937
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,000
It does suck for some people.

938
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:12,000
This one guy, they said Shanancy Flock, he had spent 700 hours playing the game.

939
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,000
I don't know.

940
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
It's just people spending money in these online games.

941
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
That's how they...

942
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,000
They don't charge you money up front, so that's how they pay for these games.

943
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,000
So...

944
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,000
What...

945
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Why do you think you should get your money back?

946
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,000
It'd be different if they announced a free-to-play game is launching,

947
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:37,000
and they had you pre-order, you know, Loot Box or something,

948
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:41,000
because I've seen that, where you pre-order TLC, and you pay for that,

949
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:46,000
and then it just fails launch or launches and lasts for a month or something like that.

950
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
I hate to say it.

951
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:53,000
I mean, it sucks, but at the end of the day, you have to know that when you buy virtual shit,

952
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:56,000
that virtual shit could get the plug pulled on it someday.

953
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
It's like Pokémon GO.

954
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
That game's not going to be around forever.

955
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,000
I mean, I hope it's around for a long time, but there's money I've spent in that game,

956
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:06,000
and it's going to be money I lose.

957
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
I'm not going to be able to get that money back.

958
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Or like Final Fantasy games.

959
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:14,000
I spent a lot of time in there, invested time.

960
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:19,000
I guess you get monthly fees for those things, but I'm not demanding a refund

961
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
because they shut the game down eventually.

962
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,000
You know, whatever.

963
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:28,000
I think it's nice when they do refunds maybe for the 30 days or the 60 days before the announcement.

964
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,000
I think it's nice when companies can do that, and it's good guy Disney,

965
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:34,000
but those are words you don't really hear in the same sentence lately,

966
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
so I'm not totally surprised.

967
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Yeah, it's unfortunate, but I'm sure there will be another online Marvel game at some point.

968
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Just keep in mind, at least this is not a game that you spent $60 on,

969
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:54,000
and you're paying microtransactions into, and then now they're kind of pulling away.

970
01:07:54,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Or even worse, a game that you had paid money for that's an online only game that they're cutting the services for,

971
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
and now you have this disc that does nothing.

972
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Thankfully, a lot of those, they do refund that stuff.

973
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:11,000
I think they did that with the Warner, the DC Universe one.

974
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
When they went from, it was originally a buy.

975
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
There was no online.

976
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:21,000
You had to pay for the disc up front, and then you'd have the game for free.

977
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Kind of think of how they have with Elder Scrolls Online, where you buy the disc,

978
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:31,000
but then they went free to play, and so obviously if you have all these discs out there,

979
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:34,000
well, fuck, what are you going to do with those?

980
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
A lot of the companies will kind of switch it over to,

981
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:43,000
oh, well, we'll give you a perk or something like that because you paid money onto it,

982
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:49,000
or they'll offer refunds for the game disc, and that's what they ended up doing with DC Universe

983
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
because I think it was shortly after launch that they did that.

984
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Or it would be nice too if maybe some of these online-based games would allow their servers to go private,

985
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
kind of like what happened with Phantasy Star Online, Blue Burst,

986
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:02,000
and then people could transfer their characters to a private server.

987
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
I think in some ways that's the best way to do it.

988
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Disney would never do that.

989
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:12,000
I know they wouldn't, but at the same time, I think that might be to really avoid maybe the negativity.

990
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:15,000
I think that would make people happy, but eh.

991
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Anyway, I wonder if this makes people happy.

992
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:22,000
A new DLC character for Tekken 7, some good old DLC,

993
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:26,000
but the DLC character that's been announced, Noctis.

994
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:30,000
That's right, Prince Noctis from Final Fantasy XV.

995
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,000
That's the new character in Tekken 7.

996
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:37,000
It was unveiled in a trailer this week, and I think it's released sometime early next year,

997
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
I think was when the releases.

998
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,000
What do you mean?

999
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Just that character in Tekken, I just don't see that.

1000
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:47,000
I mean, he fights with weapons. How does that work?

1001
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Well, he's not the first character from another series to come in the game.

1002
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:53,000
I can see him for Soul Calibur or something like that, but I don't know.

1003
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Geese Howard, who of course was Fatal Fury, that whole thing, King of Fighters, technically.

1004
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Yeah, but that's a fighting character.

1005
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Well, okay, what about this?

1006
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:07,000
So the week we were out, we missed the news about the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles coming in Justice 2,

1007
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
although I think that's kind of rad.

1008
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,000
That's cool.

1009
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
It's still comic books, right?

1010
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Yeah, that's better than like...

1011
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Very easy to palette-swap for all four turtles.

1012
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,000
Right?

1013
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:22,000
That's pretty cool. I'm down with that.

1014
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Yeah, no, I think a lot of Injustice people are pretty happy about that, so...

1015
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:30,000
But, yeah, so the big fighting game DLC news this past couple of weeks,

1016
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,000
the Ninja Turtles last week, and now...

1017
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
I totally missed that. That's pretty awesome.

1018
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Oh, you didn't hear about that?

1019
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,000
No, I didn't hear about that.

1020
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Yeah, no, Ninja Turtles are in Injustice 2.

1021
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
I still have no interest in Injustice 2, but that's cool.

1022
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,000
I don't know.

1023
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,000
I don't know. I just don't like DC characters.

1024
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
It'll be a free game at some point.

1025
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,000
The first Injustice ended up going...

1026
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:47,000
Yeah, I have the first Injustice because of the free stuff, but I never played it.

1027
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Oh, you should. It's a decent fighting.

1028
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,000
If you like the Mortal Kombat aspect...

1029
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,000
I don't.

1030
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,000
I'm not really a Mortal...

1031
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,000
I'm a more Street Fighter guy.

1032
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
I don't like Mortal Kombat, but...

1033
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Yeah, try it out. It's free.

1034
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Tigerclaw points out that the turtles in Injustice 2 is the closest thing we'll get to a TMNT tournament fighters.

1035
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Well, never say never.

1036
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Well, they have a new arcade game coming out, remember? So there's that.

1037
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Yeah, that's true.

1038
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:13,000
Kaijuna says, we want the missing Tekken fighters before we get these other ones.

1039
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Tekken 7 is awesome.

1040
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Tekken 7 should have every Tekken character ever made in it.

1041
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
It's the best fighting game out right now.

1042
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Yeah.

1043
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:27,000
William Murderface says, now we need Marvel, cross Capcom, cross Tekken, cross Fire Emblem, cross Persona.

1044
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Cross Ur-Guys.

1045
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
All right.

1046
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Anyway, let's move on. Logie.

1047
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,000
All right.

1048
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:45,000
So GameStop had this whole thing that they were trying to test out, this whole power pass where basically it would give you unlimited access to used games.

1049
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:49,000
So you'd be able to go into a store and rent the used game.

1050
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Kind of like what people do already.

1051
01:11:51,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Some people will buy a used game and you have seven days to return it, no questions asked, and then they return it and get their money back and get another used game.

1052
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
So this is more of a legit way of doing that.

1053
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:07,000
However, GameStop has decided to freeze the program right now.

1054
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:24,000
They're saying that apparently it's not certain why they kind of froze it, but they're saying right now that it could be that the computer systems that they have weren't able to handle service like that.

1055
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:28,000
So they're I guess tweaking that.

1056
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:36,000
But they said, we've elected to temporarily pause the rollout of our new power pass subscription service based on a few program limitations we have identified.

1057
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:44,000
We feel this is the right thing to do for now to ensure that we're able to provide our guests exceptional service, said one of their spokesmen.

1058
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:48,000
And yeah, it's interesting.

1059
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:52,000
It's an interesting idea for 60 bucks for six months.

1060
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
That's not bad.

1061
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:58,000
I mean, God, I know a lot of people are too young to remember.

1062
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:02,000
It's I can't believe I'm saying this are too young to remember Blockbuster.

1063
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:07,000
But for $10, unless you're in Alaska, unless you're in Alaska, that's fine.

1064
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:12,000
But like $10 and you want to talk about spending a lot of money on games.

1065
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:15,000
$10 for a month worth of rentals.

1066
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
That's fucking awesome.

1067
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:22,000
I mean, considering that it used to be like $7 a rental for like games.

1068
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:27,000
I mean, you get that for a week and that was like a fucking great ass deal at the time.

1069
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:30,000
But I know it's neat.

1070
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
I know like I went to GameStop today.

1071
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:39,000
So like my son wanted to go in the GameStop just because we're killing time and they have completely remodeled the store that's near me.

1072
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:45,000
So now it's like half toys, like half merchandise and stuff in there.

1073
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:49,000
It's just completely and it's fine because they've got some cool shit in there.

1074
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Like they've got stuff that I haven't seen before that's pretty cool.

1075
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Like they had all sorts of game themed board games.

1076
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:05,000
They had a Portal board game that I almost thought about picking up but I didn't want because I don't know if I'd have anybody to actually play it with me.

1077
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:08,000
But that was really cool. I've never seen that before.

1078
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:13,000
T-shirts. They had a giant Snorlax stuffed Snorlax thing that was really awesome.

1079
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
So they have lots of cool shit like that.

1080
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:21,000
I don't mind them having like gaming related gift stuff. That's cool because that kind of differentiates them a little bit.

1081
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:25,000
This is a good time of year to have stocking stuffers like that everywhere too.

1082
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:33,000
I was disappointed though. I mean like I know I've been looking for some of the you know more like I've been trying to get some of these Lego dimension things cheap.

1083
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:39,000
So far I haven't really running across any because it's a Lego the premium you know.

1084
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:44,000
I wanted to get the Midway one because it was cool and had like the gamer guy and like the Midway arcade cabinet and stuff like that.

1085
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:50,000
But it was like $30 like in like some of the other stores. Like full price. No thank you. I'm not paying that.

1086
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,000
And that's kind of one of the reasons why that game went downhill.

1087
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:57,000
But you know I was kind of looking for some of that stuff hoping that they were clearing that out.

1088
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:01,000
But apparently all that's gone. But I mean they still have a selection of stuff.

1089
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:06,000
It's just the games are definitely a lot slimmer now. It's not taking up all the shelf space.

1090
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:11,000
It's just tons of merchandise now which is not a terrible thing. I don't know.

1091
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:16,000
So but yeah I definitely see them trying to make money in different ways. So getting creative.

1092
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Well they got to they got to stay relevant because as we talked about earlier the whole digital thing is going to going to screw.

1093
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Let's let's think about it here. I mean where are I mean aside from the game fly where else are you going to rent stuff.

1094
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Nowhere there's like no rental stores anywhere. There's you know red box but red box has such a limited selection of games unless you're looking for brand new games.

1095
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:46,000
It's not a bad idea if you're like looking for that same experience like on the blockbuster and just picking out a game and like renting it.

1096
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:54,000
I mean that's you'll be able to play a lot of stuff. A lot of back catalog because they've got a lot of it that they're sitting on.

1097
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:58,000
So I mean it's not a terrible idea.

1098
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:05,000
All right. Well this was a news story that was linked to us on our Discord server which you can join over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

1099
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:13,000
And apparently the hubbub going on over Battlefront 2 is not the only Angry Gamer story going on right now.

1100
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:21,000
We were linked over to and this came in from s2 and under Matt linked over to a Reddit article about the game Black Desert Online.

1101
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:28,000
And apparently some protests going on on the North American servers about Black Desert Online and where it's headed in the future.

1102
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:33,000
And in this Reddit thread they talked about that they were going to join this particular server.

1103
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:41,000
And I guess they're doing a protest podcast to accompany the in-game protest where they're going to talk about the different concerns that are going on for the game.

1104
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:45,000
Which include they'd like to do some compensation for server lag.

1105
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:48,000
North American players have been dealing with disconnects in the game.

1106
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:56,000
Unbanning a very prominent community member named Blue. Balancing the classes a little better.

1107
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:01,000
Same with the malicious system. Increasing the drops on scrolls.

1108
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Helping new players to not have such a barrier to entry.

1109
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:15,000
And something called lease webs which I think have to do with I think kind of part of how the game is being run.

1110
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:22,000
That lease webs with the servers and all that stuff it's just not working out and it's causing packet loss and so forth.

1111
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
So some gamers taking to the game.

1112
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:29,000
And if you don't know Black Desert Online, I feel like didn't we see this at E3?

1113
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Because I think I remember this game getting my attention and I was like ooh that's pretty.

1114
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:36,000
And it's a Korean MMO I think but it's kind of like out over here in the states now.

1115
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
It's a very good looking game.

1116
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:43,000
But good graphics are only going to get you so far if you can't connect to the game because you have packet loss.

1117
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Or you keep getting killed over and over because it's too easy for the veteran players to have a leg up on the new players and so forth.

1118
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:56,000
So Kaijuto says how are they protesting in the game? How is that helping the game?

1119
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
I'm not sure if I'm getting the whole Rizzlizzi.

1120
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:03,000
If you love the game and want to see join the protest in Calpheon on the Calpheon1 channel at 9pm.

1121
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Maybe they're trying to take over the game to get other people to hear into their concerns.

1122
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
That might actually be kind of part of it.

1123
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Is trying to organize first.

1124
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:22,000
I guess that's what happened with EA is that once the voices kind of organized themselves on social media and Twitter.

1125
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:25,000
That's when you started seeing that backlash on what happened with Battlefront.

1126
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Because Yudo does bring up a good point. Doesn't that help the game when you protest in the game?

1127
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Is the game free to play?

1128
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,000
I don't know.

1129
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
I don't think it is. Interesting.

1130
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:38,000
But it's certainly game players that are voicing their concerns.

1131
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:44,000
S200Matt says they are refusing to buy certain aspects in the game and crowding the town areas.

1132
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,000
A few of my friends are really upset about this.

1133
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:52,000
DungeonBuster also points out Black Desert Online is also a hardcore grind because of the RNG.

1134
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Which I hear is legendarily brutal and DungeonBuster also points out it is a $10 game on Steam.

1135
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
It's not free but it's...

1136
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,000
That's all not bad.

1137
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Yeah, pretty low amount of money.

1138
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Well, yeah but it's a waste of $10 if you can't ever connect to the damn game.

1139
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,000
True.

1140
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:10,000
It will be interesting to see if the developers give a shit.

1141
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:15,000
The developers are overseas so maybe they don't care what the American audience has to say.

1142
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
But we'll see. Who knows? Who knows?

1143
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:21,000
I'll be very interested to see the follow up and see what happens with this.

1144
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Meanwhile, before we get to the classic game of the week, let's get to another news story from Loki.

1145
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Alright.

1146
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:31,000
So let's talk a little bit about Minecon Earth.

1147
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:35,000
So they did this big ol'...

1148
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:43,000
Well, instead of having Minecon in like a location, they did this whole webcast thing for like 3 hours on Saturday.

1149
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:46,000
And I didn't watch it.

1150
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:49,000
I thought about watching it at first.

1151
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
But I missed it live.

1152
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:54,000
But then I went back and watched it and my god, they wasted so much goddamn time.

1153
01:19:54,000 --> 01:20:00,000
I know they have celebrity hosts and stuff but I hate celebrity comedian hosts sometimes.

1154
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:05,000
They had Will Arnett doing it and it was really cringey.

1155
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:08,000
But there were some announcements and some fun things that they did.

1156
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:13,000
So the first thing they did was they actually had 4 different enemy types that they were talking about that they were voting on.

1157
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:18,000
And so one of those got voted to be the next new enemy.

1158
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:22,000
And so that one is this stingray looking thing that flies in the sky at night.

1159
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,000
And will attack you if you haven't slept in a few days.

1160
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:29,000
And so it's kind of neat.

1161
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:33,000
The other one they had was like a souped up blaze.

1162
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:38,000
And then they had one that was this monster that attacked you from under the ocean.

1163
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,000
And then one that was like this chopper thing that would eat you or something.

1164
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
And so they did that.

1165
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:46,000
And it looked interesting.

1166
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,000
So that's going to be implemented at some point soon.

1167
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:56,000
They did talk about how the super duper graphics update thing is going to be delayed.

1168
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Although it looks really nice.

1169
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
So that's kind of cool.

1170
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:07,000
And then they have the aquatic update that's going to be coming out with some new enemies and new weapons.

1171
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
So they've got the harpoon now.

1172
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Or it looks like a trident.

1173
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
I guess it's a trident.

1174
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:18,000
And so basically you can take that and you can throw it and you can enchant it so that it comes back to you.

1175
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Which is kind of cool.

1176
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
So I like that.

1177
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
And then they've got new stuff that they're adding underwater.

1178
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:27,000
They have dolphins now which I guess will help point you towards treasure.

1179
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:32,000
And they've got underwater like coral and seaweed and fish and stuff like that.

1180
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:38,000
So it's actually going to be more populated instead of these barren oceans.

1181
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:44,000
And then on top of that they've also added I guess some new biome types as well.

1182
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Also they have glaciers and that type of thing.

1183
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Icebergs.

1184
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
So neat.

1185
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
And so I'm not sure.

1186
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
It looks like the graphics pack is going to be delayed until 2018.

1187
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:59,000
The aquatic pack is going to be coming soon.

1188
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:03,000
But they haven't really said when yet for that one.

1189
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:09,000
But if you do play a little bit of Minecraft and you are interested, they do have some free content out there now.

1190
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:15,000
So you can go to the Minecraft store that they added to the game and download free skins that they have for that as well.

1191
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
So go get those skins.

1192
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
Go get the little world that they had.

1193
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
And free stuff.

1194
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
But yes, seriously though.

1195
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
It was a goddamn waste.

1196
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Although they did some musical numbers and they were kind of funny.

1197
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
One of them was at least.

1198
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
The other one was not.

1199
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Do you think you'll still keep an eye on Minecraft with these changes and updates?

1200
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
A little bit.

1201
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
Like some of the stuff they were talking about was in game.

1202
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
I guess they have the whole...

1203
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
I forget what they call them because I still haven't played too much Minecraft recently.

1204
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
I get bored with it so fast.

1205
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
I keep going back to it.

1206
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:50,000
I did play Minecraft this week as well actually on the Windows 10 version.

1207
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
And I just get bored with it.

1208
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
Survival mode is kind of boring.

1209
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
Because it's not really forcing you to...

1210
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
You're not really running out of resources really fast.

1211
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
It's more of just like...

1212
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Okay, I better dig down to...

1213
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:05,000
You kind of have to force yourself to try to get to these objectives.

1214
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:08,000
There's nothing really kind of pushing you to do it.

1215
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,000
There's not challenging you to survive or anything.

1216
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
It's kind of easy.

1217
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
I don't know.

1218
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:19,000
I mean I could bump up the difficulty but that just makes it so I have to bash in things longer.

1219
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
That doesn't really do anything.

1220
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Alright.

1221
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Well even though Minecraft is a classic looking game.

1222
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:29,000
Let's take a moment to talk about the classic game of the week.

1223
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:33,000
Every week Dark Soccer likes to step into the gaming vault and find the game that she thinks...

1224
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Hey!

1225
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
You brats!

1226
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
You should recognize this game this week.

1227
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
This game doesn't have loot boxes.

1228
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
Go check this game out.

1229
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
It's the classic game of the week.

1230
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
But Dark Soccer is not here.

1231
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
So...

1232
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
I'm going to take over tonight.

1233
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:55,000
And I'm taking over in the spirit of the 19 November holiday that we had today.

1234
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
No, I didn't pick a Bamani game tonight.

1235
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:01,000
But I did pick a game that I thought maybe we wouldn't have had Bamani.

1236
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Or Dance Dance Revolution or any of that stuff if it wasn't for this game.

1237
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
So that's why I picked...

1238
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Dance Aerobics!

1239
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
That's right.

1240
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
Dance Aerobics.

1241
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:17,000
The NES release that required the power pad in order to be able to play this game.

1242
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
So...

1243
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
With the sweet voice synthesis you can hear it going...

1244
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Come on!

1245
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
One, two, three.

1246
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
I think those are the only words in the whole game.

1247
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
Come on and then one, two, three, four.

1248
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
Over and over and over again.

1249
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
And the sweet NES backdrop music that's playing there.

1250
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Anyway...

1251
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:39,000
So Dance Aerobics was released by Nintendo in North America.

1252
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:43,000
And it was released by Bandai overseas in Japan.

1253
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
Because it was kind of Bandai's power pad over there.

1254
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:49,000
It came out in Japan in 1987 on February 26th.

1255
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:55,000
It came out in North America March 1989 as one of the games for the power pad.

1256
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:59,000
It was originally the third game in Bandai's Family Trainer series.

1257
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:03,000
And it uses side B of the infamous power pad.

1258
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
Every game used side B.

1259
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:08,000
You may not remember the power pad had side A and side B.

1260
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,000
I don't remember that.

1261
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
Side B was the 12 numbers.

1262
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:15,000
Side A was where it had like the two red dots in the center.

1263
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:19,000
And then there were like six blue dots around it.

1264
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
And I don't think like any game used that.

1265
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:24,000
So anyway, Dance Aerobics used side B.

1266
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:27,000
And it had several different modes to it.

1267
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
Including normal mode.

1268
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Where you have different aerobics classes.

1269
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:34,000
And you play through the classes to unlock more classes.

1270
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:37,000
You follow the motions of the instructor by stepping on the buttons.

1271
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
When the instructor steps on the buttons.

1272
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:42,000
And sometimes it's going to involve the hands.

1273
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Some of the more advanced levels you might put your hands on one and four.

1274
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
And then your legs are on nine and ten.

1275
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
And you're like kicking up your legs.

1276
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
So you know it is.

1277
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:56,000
I mean especially you know this game is what a lot of people kind of think of or joke about.

1278
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:59,000
Especially when we talk about the whole exercise gaming craze.

1279
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:02,000
That really took over when the Kinect was released right.

1280
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Because the Kinect could really follow you.

1281
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
Well this in some ways was a precursor to that.

1282
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:10,000
Except obviously the dance pad was the only thing that could really know what you're doing.

1283
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
So I'm sure tons of people would cheat at this.

1284
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
But if you get a game like Dance Aerobics.

1285
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:18,000
I would imagine the idea behind is that you're actually going to follow the routines.

1286
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:21,000
And you may get a little bit of exercise doing that.

1287
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Let's see.

1288
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
You start with a score of one hundred.

1289
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
And with each mistake you make.

1290
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
Your score is reduced by ten.

1291
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:35,000
And it only goes up if you completely correctly do a routine.

1292
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
If the counter reaches zero.

1293
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,000
You've failed.

1294
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:42,000
And then the games will go on as the player passes levels.

1295
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:45,000
New harder songs are unlocked and the difficulty goes up.

1296
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,000
There are other modes too.

1297
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
You can go into something called pad antics.

1298
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
Where you get tune up.

1299
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:53,000
Where the two buttons in the center of the power pad are deactivated.

1300
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:57,000
And the rest of the ten pads are assigned different musical notes.

1301
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
So it's just basically stomp and make music.

1302
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
I bet kids would love that shit.

1303
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:04,000
Mat Melodies you would stand on the center pad.

1304
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:07,000
And then the game plays a short song and you repeat it back.

1305
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
So like assignment says with that whole thing.

1306
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
And then there's ditto.

1307
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:14,000
Which basically you use a hand or a foot on the power pad.

1308
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
It's basically solo twister.

1309
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Which I'm sure is tons of fun right?

1310
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
But that's what ditto was.

1311
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:21,000
So there you go.

1312
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:24,000
And then in aerobics mode you have the four original songs from normal mode.

1313
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,000
They're all available.

1314
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:28,000
But when the counter reaches zero the music continues.

1315
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:31,000
And the player can attempt to mimic the moves by the instructor.

1316
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:32,000
But there's no progression.

1317
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:35,000
You can think of it as like a type of easy mode if you will.

1318
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:38,000
So at the end of the day I mean it was a pretty simple game.

1319
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:39,000
It was on the NES.

1320
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
There wasn't a whole lot of else to it.

1321
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
But I think this game is important to acknowledge.

1322
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:47,000
Because it is a precursor certainly to the whole exercise gaming thing.

1323
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:51,000
And even a game like DDR which we're kind of you know celebrating here.

1324
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
With it being this weekend.

1325
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Even though there were no scrolling notes on the screen.

1326
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:59,000
Which is very you know reminiscent of that series.

1327
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:03,000
Certainly there is the whole follow what I'm doing on this mat.

1328
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
Which is very similar to what we got with DDR.

1329
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
So and it's to the beat of the music.

1330
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
And as she counts along.

1331
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,000
So there it is.

1332
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Your classic game of the week.

1333
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:21,000
Dance Aerobics by Bandai in 1987 for the Japanese Famicom.

1334
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
1989 all the way here in the US.

1335
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
Because it took us a while to get the power pad if you remember right.

1336
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,000
There it is.

1337
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,000
Classic game of the week.

1338
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:31,000
Looking in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

1339
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
William Murderface says since Stark Sakura is gone.

1340
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
Do we get Halo as classic game of the week?

1341
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
No because I value my life.

1342
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:41,000
Come on Noel Gus says Zumba on the Wii was pretty fun.

1343
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:44,000
Alright we're gonna take a quick break.

1344
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
But when we come back there's plenty more show to come.

1345
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:47,000
Including rapid fire news.

1346
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:50,000
We're gonna get to your emails and what's in stores as well.

1347
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:53,000
We're gonna talk about the potential of Mario Brothers becoming a movie.

1348
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
And we'll talk a little bit about the Vive.

1349
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
And the future direction for that.

1350
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:58,000
So that'll be fun.

1351
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
And maybe Mr. Schmoosh will say hello.

1352
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,000
Mr. Schmoosh.

1353
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:04,000
He just looks at the mic and I think he's trying to smoosh.

1354
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:07,000
See I call him Mr. Schmoosh not just because he has the smooshy face.

1355
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
But he smooshes his face into things.

1356
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Like the mic.

1357
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:15,000
So anyway he's sitting in one of our guest chairs right now just chillin.

1358
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,000
So anyway.

1359
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,000
We're gonna take a break.

1360
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:20,000
We'll come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

1361
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:30,000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio Live Tonight.

1362
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
Episode number 707 of our show.

1363
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:35,000
For this 19 November of 2017.

1364
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Just myself and Loki here in studio tonight.

1365
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
Dark Sakura she's out tonight.

1366
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
She had a charity event that she's doing.

1367
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:45,000
So we're just here holding down the fort with the news.

1368
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:48,000
You missed a whole lot of talk about loot box in the first half.

1369
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:49,000
If you're just joining us live tonight.

1370
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:52,000
But it'll all be there for you on the podcast feed.

1371
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:55,000
A big shout out to everybody that listens to us on the podcast feed.

1372
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:59,000
Are you guys listening to our pal Bobby Blackwell from the podcast feed as well?

1373
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Cause I wanted to give a cheap plug for his show that he did last week while we were gone.

1374
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:07,000
So I think some of you might have missed it because you may have also been gone because of a long weekend.

1375
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
And we weren't here live.

1376
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:12,000
So some of you may have missed this live.

1377
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:15,000
But check out episode 592 of Bobby's show.

1378
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:19,000
He actually interviewed somebody who was a listener of his.

1379
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Actually still is.

1380
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:23,000
But you know just not participating as much live.

1381
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:30,000
But Tim came on the show to talk about the archive team and the Miiverse preservation project.

1382
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:33,000
Because Nintendo of course closed Miiverse while we were gone.

1383
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:36,000
And so it's talking a little bit about the Miiverse preservation project.

1384
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,000
What it is.

1385
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,000
Why they're doing it.

1386
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
And you know how it might change from region to region.

1387
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,000
And so on and so forth.

1388
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:42,000
So check that out.

1389
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:46,000
It's also the big plug at vognetwork.com right now.

1390
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:49,000
So you can just click on that and go right to it.

1391
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,000
I should also give a shout out as well.

1392
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:55,000
If I'm going to shout out Bobby I also need to shout out our other great gaming shows we have here at the Voice Geek Network.

1393
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
We have a lot of great shows on the network.

1394
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
But specifically of course our gaming buddies.

1395
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
I have to say hello to Electric Sistahood.

1396
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:02,000
And check in with them.

1397
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,000
And Game Buoy is back.

1398
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
They were on a little bit of a break.

1399
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
But Game Buoy just put out a new episode not that long ago.

1400
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
So check out Electric Sistahood and Game Buoy.

1401
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:13,000
They are both there on the network at vognetwork.com as well.

1402
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
Alright let's get back into some news.

1403
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:16,000
Rapid Fire style.

1404
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,000
Loki.

1405
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:18,000
Yes.

1406
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:21,000
So let's talk a little bit about Pokemans Go.

1407
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:24,000
So they've got some new things with that.

1408
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:28,000
Including you can get some of the low end fashion now for your characters.

1409
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,000
That's right.

1410
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:33,000
So Pokemon Sun Ultra Sun Ultra Moon are coming out.

1411
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Or I should say have already come out.

1412
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
And now they have to kind of go along with that.

1413
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:41,000
There is some new things you can get.

1414
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
When can I get a new face?

1415
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:44,000
Never.

1416
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
You can never change your face.

1417
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:49,000
So you can get a straw hat.

1418
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:50,000
A tank top.

1419
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
And looks like shorts.

1420
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:53,000
And yeah.

1421
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:56,000
So those are available right now.

1422
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,000
So go check it out.

1423
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
I don't know if they cost anything.

1424
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Hopefully not.

1425
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,000
They don't.

1426
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:02,000
Sweet.

1427
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,000
Alright.

1428
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:06,000
And then they have this new Pokemon Go event.

1429
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:11,000
That this Pokemon Go travel and the global catch challenge.

1430
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:25,000
So with that I guess they're saying they guess Pokemon Go travel is taking I guess groups of trainers from around the world to Japan to host the first ever global catch challenge.

1431
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:32,000
And so with that I guess they're trying to catch three billion Pokemon in seven days.

1432
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:35,000
That's a lot.

1433
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:41,000
So then with that I guess there's different rewards that people can get.

1434
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
So double XP.

1435
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:46,000
So for five million catches of bronze.

1436
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:52,000
I guess everyone gets double XP as well as I guess the.

1437
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Oh what the hell do they call those six hour lures.

1438
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:55,000
Yes the lures.

1439
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:56,000
Thank you.

1440
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,000
The lures are six hours.

1441
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
So it's silver.

1442
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:03,000
You're going to be getting double XP the six hour lures and also double stardust.

1443
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:19,000
And finally if they do end up catching three billion then you'll get the double XP six hour lures double stardust Farfetch'd will be available worldwide for 48 hours and Kangaskhan will be available in East Asia.

1444
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:31,000
That's a big freaking deal because that's one of those regional exclusives you can't catch Farfetch'd here in the US right now Farfetch'd is exclusive to Asia which is why they're getting Kangaskhan instead because it wouldn't matter if they got Farfetch'd because they already have it.

1445
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:46,000
So this is a really big deal that you know you were going to have a chance to catch a regional exclusive outside what Anaheim I think was the only place you could do that before they had Kangaskhan available I think during that actual Pokemon worlds event that was down in Anaheim but that's really it.

1446
01:33:46,000 --> 01:34:00,000
So it's going to be the first chance you know in America we've had to catch Farfetch'd assuming we meet that three billion Pokemon mark but I don't know I have I have never known this game to announce rewards they didn't end up giving out.

1447
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:22,000
And that same thing happened remember with go fest or it was like oh we're just going to give you all the rewards and I was kind of that was good I kind of think fucked up well and I also think that was always the intended thing to do you don't want to dangle that stuff in front of people and then not give it to them so I kind of think you're going to get it anyway but but why not go release you know everything I suppose.

1448
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:40,000
JD in chat says Chicago did a thing where they released regional exclusives during the big meltdown event oh that's right they were able to get was a Heracross I think was available there which usually is something you can only get in like South Florida you have to be below a certain latitude.

1449
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:50,000
You have to be below a certain latitude to get Heracross and you can get it in parts of South Florida for the most part it's Latin America's Pokemon.

1450
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:56,000
So anyway let's move on you got one more thing for us right Logan?

1451
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:05,000
So then they're adding I don't know how to feel about this I still don't I saw the agents of mayhem today at GameStop and I'm like oh yeah that game came out didn't it.

1452
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:18,000
Like I forgot all about it already but they have DLC coming out now Saints Rose Kinsey is joining them as her call sign is was it safe word.

1453
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:29,000
Because she's a nerd but she's in the BDSM he he he that's funny hot nerd yeah alright so anyways so she's now available as DLC for $5.

1454
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
I love me some Saints Row.

1455
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:42,000
I will never buy agents of mayhem really that's so surprising why didn't you end up getting this I would have thought you would have been all over this agents of mayhem is not Saints Row.

1456
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:56,000
It's it's not and the game is not that great so no thanks all right maybe when it's like dirt cheap it will probably someday be something I get in the humble bundle but I'm never I'm never buying this game as it is right now.

1457
01:35:56,000 --> 01:36:08,000
You're not you're not mad at it because it's not Saints Row I am mad at it but I'm also mad at it because it's crap and like if it was a guy give me give me what one reason why it's crap the gameplay is cheap.

1458
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:13,000
It's just not in as the missions are all basically the same.

1459
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:24,000
There's the humor that it seems very forced and I don't like this whole oh it was originally going to be its own thing like I remember when it first got out.

1460
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:35,000
Oh no this isn't going to be Saints Row we just want to come up with this new game ball and then they throw Johnny get in there and all said now it's just a spin off of the universe of Saints Row.

1461
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:47,000
It's like OK dude how much confidence did you have in your game where originally it was just going to be its own thing but then you lost confidence and so now it's part of Saints Row because people like Saints Row.

1462
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:52,000
It's just it's such a desperate attempt to get people to buy this game.

1463
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,000
No thank you.

1464
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:56,000
I don't I don't want to play this game.

1465
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,000
It's not Saints Row.

1466
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
Give me a fucking Saints Row game.

1467
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:07,000
All right all right moving on to a game that I think Loki has less of a problem with actually it may not be true because it's a Konami game dance dance revolution.

1468
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
Oh yes I hate dance dance revolution.

1469
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:17,000
Well anyway I know because it is 19 November I should give a shout out to this this project going on in the community.

1470
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:26,000
They call it Delta Max why they call it Delta Delta show short for DDR extreme lots of triple A's and what they're trying to do is they're trying to perfect full combo.

1471
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:39,000
All of the songs on DDR extreme that's 256 songs on DDR extreme that's that's kind of an older game at this point but it was probably the most easy one to find in arcades for a long time because it was a big lull after that.

1472
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:51,000
So anyway it started today it started at 1 o'clock Eastern and they're trying to go through as fast as possible and see how long it's going to take to perfect combo every song in the game.

1473
01:37:51,000 --> 01:38:00,000
And I guess they had a Google Doc sheet to do this. Did they do it because the previous record was seven hours so it's already been seven hours so I want to know if they already beat it or not.

1474
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:07,000
I guess should I go to the Google Doc sheet and see if they did it. Why not. I'm bringing it up right now.

1475
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:13,000
You're leaving Facebook to follow. I know I was on Facebook in the first place. Let's see did they do it.

1476
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:17,000
They did but I didn't see how how long did it take them.

1477
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:22,000
Dr. Seuss is going to have to break this down for me. I don't know how long it took him to do it.

1478
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:29,000
But I do know that Carlos got 68 of those combos so he's number one. So good job Carlos.

1479
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:42,000
All right. One more story about pinball FX 3 pinball FX 3 is been delayed a little bit on the switch was supposed to be out by now but it's coming out on the e-shop early next month.

1480
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:53,000
However Zen studios is explaining why they've delayed it. And I got to say this does sound like a pretty rad reason what they've done is they've added functionality so you can play vertical.

1481
01:38:53,000 --> 01:39:05,000
So you can take your switch and now turn it sideways and you can play it vertically with a single joy con the single joy con is meant to be attached to the console still to have that weight.

1482
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:14,000
So you hold the screen basically vertically I guess kind of like by the joy covers. There's no stand to hold it vertically. So it took them five hours and 21 minutes.

1483
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:27,000
Where'd you find that. I was on their Facebook. Oh there you go. Thank you. All right. Five hours 21 minutes. Well that's extra time you can play pinball FX 3 on the switch when it comes out and the vertical mode and that actually that actually does sound kind of rad.

1484
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:45,000
And then studios actually points out this was a suggestion of somebody at Nintendo who loves pinball to do this. So that's pretty neat. What do you think of that that they're using the switches technology of basically being a handheld TV to flip the TV on its side and present the pinball vertically using more space.

1485
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:48,000
PSP did it first.

1486
01:39:48,000 --> 01:40:03,000
Simpsons did it. No I mean it's nice that they're actually doing that but like you know it's not innovative. It's just it's makes sense. I don't know. It sounds kind of cool. All right. Let's travel around the world and check out what is in stores this week.

1487
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:15,000
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says they did this on the Vita version of Zen pinball. I'm surprised this was a new revelation to them. All right fine. It shows you how much I paid attention to the Vita was travel around the world and check out what is coming out in stores this week.

1488
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:29,000
It might be slowing down a bit though with Thanksgiving. Yeah I think it's definitely slowing down. They typically don't release a whole ton of stuff. Thanksgiving week so you know but this week we do have a few things coming out.

1489
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:45,000
So starting off we've got Luma which is on the Nintendo switch gear club unlimited also on the switch project Nimbus code Mariah on PlayStation 4 super beat Sonic on the Nintendo switch.

1490
01:40:45,000 --> 01:41:05,000
And of course Animal Crossing pocket camp on Android and iOS portal nights coming out on the switch. And I didn't realize this was a thing that was coming out. But I am super excited about this now that I've just discovered this again.

1491
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:25,000
I think it's either I don't know if it's a spin off or what but they have the Earth Defense Force 4.1 wing diver the shooter coming out. So I don't remember if that was I don't know if that's an expansion or if that's I think that's just for I don't know. I don't know what that is.

1492
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:39,000
All right travel look into that traveling over to Japan. It's not Thanksgiving over there but I think things are still slowing down a little bit. But we do have you know some releases this week including Hatsune Miku Project Diva future tone DX.

1493
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:48,000
I was gonna say I thought this game was already out but this sounds like it's a DX version that's coming out. So that is going to be available from Sega and that is out on the 22nd so you can check that out.

1494
01:41:48,000 --> 01:42:09,000
Otherwise this week let's see looking at the Nintendo Switch Breath of the Wild with some type of guidebook and world map limited edition. So I kind of thought this was already a thing that was out but I guess this is just to match the explorers edition that's out in the US which sounds like it might be like a rebundling of the game for basically the holiday audience for people that didn't already buy it.

1495
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:16,000
I think that's what it is where they basically including some other physical garbage to make everything interesting again.

1496
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:22,000
So Wing Diver the Shooter is a vertical shooter game set in the Earth Defense Force 4.1 universe.

1497
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:23,000
Well that'll be fun.

1498
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:24,000
That's interesting.

1499
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:42,000
Yeah and the Vita there's just one release Kamidonami Sushi Gute Ore no Mirai Ga Ya Bai in regular and limited edition and yes that I said the Vita because even though I'm not paying attention to the Vita here people in Japan are still paying attention over there because they still release games on it so that's really it for releases this week in Japan.

1500
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
Oh I didn't check the 3DS actually.

1501
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:49,000
Beeblay God is the lone release on the 3DS this week.

1502
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
How about the UK do you have that up Logie?

1503
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:54,000
No but I can so let's do that.

1504
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
With our Sakura not being here somebody's got to do it.

1505
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:59,000
I'm sure they're getting probably the same stuff we're getting over here.

1506
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
Not a whole ton of things.

1507
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:06,000
So let's see for this week we've got actually nothing.

1508
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
I don't show anything on the list here.

1509
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:15,000
I would assume Animal Crossing is coming out probably in that region as well.

1510
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
So that's probably a thing.

1511
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:20,000
Yeah I mean if we're getting it here they should be getting it there right?

1512
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:27,000
Yeah your reamer's lists are kind of vague on a lot of things so I'm going to assume that Animal Crossing is coming out.

1513
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
So look for that.

1514
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
And if you're wrong then you're wrong.

1515
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:32,000
And who cares.

1516
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:35,000
Alright I got to get in the mail bag I forgot I had to do this tonight.

1517
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:47,000
Every week you guys send us emails participate at orange lounge radio dot com.

1518
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:51,000
And we log into the mail bag and read some of our favorites here on the air.

1519
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
And I know we have at least a couple that came in this week.

1520
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
So I want to get to it.

1521
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
I thought we did.

1522
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
Where'd they go?

1523
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:04,000
I feel like this is sorted a different way than it used to be.

1524
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
Hold on there we go alright.

1525
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
Jamie messed up that mail bag while she was in there just kidding.

1526
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:13,000
Alright let's get to it we have a couple emails to read here tonight.

1527
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:17,000
The first email tonight is coming from Robert M.

1528
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
Who emails us and says.

1529
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:27,000
The originally line published Skullgirls mobile game and Pokemon Go just had somewhat significant updates.

1530
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:31,000
Double for the former gen 3 ghost type ladder.

1531
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:35,000
Which had me realizing both are free games in which I've not seen a single ad.

1532
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:38,000
I don't have the option to watch ads for gems or coins.

1533
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
I don't have ads forced on me.

1534
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:43,000
There's just no advertisements period.

1535
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
Of course both games do have in app purchases.

1536
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:48,000
I admit buying a few coins for a few cosmetics.

1537
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:49,000
Okay glasses.

1538
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:52,000
For my trainer before being able to earn coins in gyms.

1539
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:56,000
I admire these kinds of models and have to ask.

1540
01:44:56,000 --> 01:45:00,000
Besides probably ingress are there any apps on your phone or device which are.

1541
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:01,000
A. Free.

1542
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
B. Ad free.

1543
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:07,000
C. You don't feel forced into in app purchases for basic progression.

1544
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:10,000
Thanks and have a great week wherever you are.

1545
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:16,000
I'll open that question up to the chat too because I only have so many cell phone games that I play.

1546
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:19,000
You guys probably have many more.

1547
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:23,000
What games do you meet Robert M's specifications there?

1548
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:27,000
It's a free game ad free and you don't feel forced into in app purchases for progression.

1549
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:32,000
I don't have any of those and unfortunately the game I play the office space one.

1550
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:35,000
It gets worse every week like they keep introducing stuff.

1551
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:39,000
When I first started playing it was pretty straightforward and how you play that.

1552
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:44,000
Now it's so fucking convoluted and complicated with like multiple currencies in there.

1553
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:49,000
And just like all sorts of things that they want you to watch ads and like slow your progression down.

1554
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:50,000
It's just.

1555
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:51,000
It's a mess.

1556
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:54,000
I would say honestly even Pokemon go.

1557
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:57,000
I mean as much as I enjoy that game and I play that game.

1558
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:02,000
Like if you don't know what you're doing or you live in a more rural area where you don't have a lot of pokey stops.

1559
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
You're going to run out of pokey balls.

1560
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:07,000
You know and so you're kind of forced into in app purchases that way.

1561
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
I don't have that problem because I live in a bigger city.

1562
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:14,000
I've bought pokey balls though before and they have had a balancing thing that's happened.

1563
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:18,000
So you don't get as many potions now because you get those from raids which is a whole nother change.

1564
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:26,000
But it would be cool if you could watch like an ad or something once a day to get like 10 pokey coins or like something ridiculously small.

1565
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:31,000
My assumption is if more and more people abandon Pokemon Go they'll go that route eventually.

1566
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:36,000
I mean if they have to do ads to keep the lights on then that's what they'll do.

1567
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:39,000
To Ingress's credit with as long as I've been playing that game.

1568
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:42,000
You really you really aren't coursed into buying anything in that game.

1569
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:48,000
And even the in app purchases like I think I've maybe only ever spent with as much as I've talked about that game on the show.

1570
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
You guys I think I've maybe only ever spent ten dollars on it.

1571
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
Yeah probably about the same.

1572
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
Out in the game itself.

1573
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:58,000
Now I've paid more gas in my car for this fucking thing.

1574
01:46:58,000 --> 01:46:59,000
Data plans.

1575
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
I don't have to pay for that thank god.

1576
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
I've gone to Ingress live events.

1577
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:06,000
Including there's one coming up in San Francisco on December 2nd.

1578
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:09,000
A live event and I'm paying basically money to do that.

1579
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:14,000
So you know just a little bit it's not a lot but still I mean I guess there is that.

1580
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:19,000
Let's see I'm trying to think of games I have on my phone.

1581
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:23,000
Well there's Draconius Go.

1582
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
Pokemon Go's new little competitor.

1583
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
Oh yeah I forgot about that.

1584
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:31,000
Miitomo I didn't really feel coursed into buying anything in Miitomo.

1585
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:37,000
I was playing that nonstop night for a while and I don't remember really being coursed into buying stuff on that.

1586
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:43,000
You can watch ads for crystals and they have like a daily deal or like a deal that happens every few hours.

1587
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
Yeah that's right I do remember watching a lot of ads.

1588
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
You can do an ad for that.

1589
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:54,000
Or like they'll do like oh you've been away for like a couple hours you can double your money that you've earned during that time if you watch an ad or something.

1590
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
Yeah I forgot about that.

1591
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
You don't have to do it.

1592
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
But I mean I don't know.

1593
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:05,000
Let's see looking in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

1594
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:10,000
Let's see Fifth Dream says Final Fantasy Brave Exvius kind of doesn't.

1595
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:15,000
It has an area with promotions for in-game purchases but I don't notice anything that pops up telling you to buy things.

1596
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:21,000
Dungeon Buster says the only cell phone game I have was Tiny Death Star on my old phone.

1597
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:25,000
Sorry that Tiny Tower I remember when everybody was playing the shit out of that.

1598
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
Is that still a thing? Do people still play Tiny Tower?

1599
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
Is it ad free? I don't remember.

1600
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
Let's see.

1601
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:35,000
Bobby Blackwolf says I doubt there are any free games that have no ads in them.

1602
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:40,000
Even the little word puzzle games I play that have a free puzzle every day have ads for their other puzzles in them.

1603
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:47,000
JD says Pokemon Shuffle gets a little pay to winnish and I know people that bought money in Miitomo.

1604
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:50,000
If you got really serious about the dress up it has a bit of a coin.

1605
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:55,000
What kind of phone does he have? Is it Android or iOS?

1606
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:58,000
I don't think it was called out in the email actually.

1607
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:08,000
If you're looking for like games you know what would be kind of fun is like I find I follow like a lot of different subreddits and so one of them is the Unity 3D one.

1608
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:12,000
And so you'll see occasionally people will put their games up there and say hey go try out my game.

1609
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
And it's free.

1610
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:20,000
So you can go download it and there's usually no ads and that type of stuff so that's one thing to check out.

1611
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
Or just like you know the game dev forum.

1612
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:26,000
So something a little more under the radar for somebody who's just a proud person.

1613
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:34,000
Sometimes there's fun stuff like there's a game I have called Flip Stuff that's kind of frustrating but it's a game where you basically flip an object and you try to get the land a certain way.

1614
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:38,000
And I've played that for hours at one time and there's no ads in that.

1615
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:44,000
I mean so it's you can find stuff that people make and I don't know it's kind of fun sometimes.

1616
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:50,000
JD also points out Tiny Tower is definitely not ad free lol they have a new one Tiny Tower Vegas.

1617
01:49:50,000 --> 01:50:02,000
There's a lot of games like Plants vs. Zombies and stuff that you've played before that now new versions are just it's just remember Plants vs. Zombies and PopCap they're owned by EA.

1618
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:08,000
EA is evil so take it like I don't know what you expect.

1619
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:13,000
Alright I've got another email here one more this week from Redertainment who emails us.

1620
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:19,000
Hello peoples I have a thought about the debate between digital copies of video games and physical copies of video games.

1621
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
A thought that encompasses other things.

1622
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:25,000
My inclination is toward physical copies of things before because of price.

1623
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:33,000
The price of physical copies of things usually goes down over time due to a number of factors ranging from market forces to the retailer needing room for other things.

1624
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:36,000
Digital copies of things do not tend to go down over time.

1625
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:45,000
Sure there's sales for digital goods but prices are not the norm and if we include sales as a reasoning for this argument we also need to include sales of physical goods.

1626
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
Look up the price of an album released last year.

1627
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:53,000
Specifically the digital version on iTunes and a physical version of the same album on Amazon.

1628
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:58,000
Because you can't look up the price at your local independent record store as you read this because the store is closed right now.

1629
01:50:58,000 --> 01:50:59,000
True.

1630
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:06,000
I can guarantee the price of the physical version of the album is lower by at least a couple of dollars compared to the digital version.

1631
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:11,000
The same can be said of video games, books, TV shows, movies, etc. etc. Pie.

1632
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:14,000
There's a small wrinkle in this for me.

1633
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:18,000
Back in March a number of big plastic tubs were stolen from a unit I had at a storage facility.

1634
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:23,000
Insert 2,000 word all caps rant about a police department you've never heard of here.

1635
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:31,000
For a few months after that theft I preferred- wait did the police steal your games? Like what happened there? It sucks either way. Sorry to hear that.

1636
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:41,000
For a few months after that theft I preferred digital copies because while I did lose a good number of physical copies of vintage video games I did not lose any of my digital copies of things.

1637
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:49,000
However, now that I've moved to a place where I have access to a secure storage unit, I'm back to preferring physical copies of things.

1638
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
Stay black. Retertainment.

1639
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:55,000
Yay. OLR is great. Jamie is rad. Loki is okay.

1640
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:58,000
I sell for okay.

1641
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
Well thank you for that email, Retertainment.

1642
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:13,000
It sounds like you've really gone back and forth on them is that that whole shitty situation with the theft kind of made you see like oh there is some value in digital because I don't lose shit digitally.

1643
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:21,000
But at the same time you know it's kind of nice to have the physical stuff and you're right the physical stuff tends to get discounted first for good or for worse.

1644
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:30,000
It almost ties into that what we were talking about earlier at the top of the show where I said if a game is really worth $70 then fine put the game out at $70.

1645
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:36,000
But we all know in the back of our head it's going to end up in the bargain bin of 30 or 40 bucks eventually.

1646
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:42,000
Especially all that DLC. Oh you want to charge me all this money for the DLC you can't tell me you're going to have a game of the year edition that's coming out?

1647
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:46,000
So the question is how bad do I need that game now?

1648
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
Subreddit patient gamers.

1649
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:53,000
But to be fair the movie industry has had to deal with this since the 80s.

1650
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
Yeah.

1651
01:52:55,000 --> 01:53:01,000
Because should I pay the $15 how much does it fucking cost to see a movie these days? It's expensive.

1652
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:04,000
It's expensive because like you're talking like.

1653
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
If you cut out the popcorn and junior mint DLC.

1654
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
I can I need it I need it.

1655
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:11,000
That's why I go there half the time is to eat the popcorn.

1656
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:15,000
Okay but if you cut out the large Diet Coke DLC.

1657
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:21,000
I don't like see that's the thing now is like I get a small soda which is still like a gallon of soda and so.

1658
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:27,000
I paid $45 a ticket to see a movie that came out in 1997 over the weekend.

1659
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
Romeo and Michelle's high school reunion.

1660
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:38,000
But they had drag queens doing a full pre-show including for those that follow that whole scene Trixie and Katya were doing Romeo and Michelle.

1661
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:42,000
So I'm sorry worth every fucking penny that I paid to see that.

1662
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:45,000
And Dark Soccer I'm sure I want to talk about that next week when she's back.

1663
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:48,000
But that certainly made me want to go see something in the theater.

1664
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:51,000
And I spent money on soda DLC.

1665
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
But anyway the point I was trying to make.

1666
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
The movie industry has been dealing with this since the 80s.

1667
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:59,000
They said that VHS and the whole home video market was gonna fucking kill him.

1668
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:02,000
Because nobody would go to the theater to see a movie anymore.

1669
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:05,000
But people still go to the movies.

1670
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:08,000
People still saw Justice League. Did anyone see Justice League this weekend?

1671
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
I don't know how it did at the box office.

1672
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
I didn't read the box office results.

1673
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
I think people saw it. I don't know. I'm not gonna go see it.

1674
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
Although I have taken a day off.

1675
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
I've taken the 15th off to go see Star Wars.

1676
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:22,000
But see that day I'm planning on seeing Star Wars, Thor.

1677
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
Not sure about Justice League.

1678
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
But at least those two.

1679
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
I'm not hating on Justice League.

1680
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:36,000
Because I haven't seen any movie at all since Shane dragged me to Power Rangers back in late March.

1681
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:40,000
But you'll know. Star Wars, they have opening shows at 9am that day.

1682
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:44,000
So I'm on a full day of popcorn and unhealthy shit.

1683
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
So anyway.

1684
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:52,000
But people still pay the premium money to go see something on the big screen.

1685
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:55,000
As opposed to, eh, I'll just wait for it to be on HBO or Netflix.

1686
01:54:55,000 --> 01:55:00,000
Which is kind of the modern, since you say blockbusters are gone, which they are.

1687
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
You don't really wait for it on video anymore.

1688
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
Because if you buy the blu-ray, you're gonna play probably...

1689
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:05,000
I miss...

1690
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
Well, it depends on the size of your family.

1691
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:13,000
If you take a family of four to go see a new Pixar movie, it actually is cheaper to just buy the $30 blu-ray.

1692
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
It is. Much.

1693
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
Even just one person going.

1694
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:21,000
Say you don't go to a matinee, you're paying $12 for a ticket.

1695
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:26,000
Food like popcorn and soda is probably going to run you at least $10.

1696
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:29,000
I mean, that's $22 at least right there.

1697
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:32,000
That's probably on the cheap side.

1698
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:35,000
So that's almost the price of a blu-ray already.

1699
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
If not, you know...

1700
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:38,000
I don't know.

1701
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:41,000
I miss Spider-Man in theaters.

1702
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:44,000
And I know we miss Cars 3.

1703
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:48,000
So I saw those on DVD the other day at the grocery store.

1704
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:53,000
So I was like, well jeez, I better acquire this through digital means.

1705
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:57,000
But anyway, my point is, people will still pay the premium to see it first.

1706
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:01,000
Now granted, it could be, is it the big screen having an effect?

1707
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:02,000
But I don't know.

1708
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:09,000
Like, you know, now that we got 4K TVs with super good refresh rates, sometimes watching movies at home almost looks better.

1709
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
You know, and I think people...

1710
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:17,000
And eventually this might be a thing where people will pay a premium to like...

1711
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:23,000
Almost like a pay-per-view type thing for like, see Star Wars live on TV.

1712
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
But I think it's getting...

1713
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
I think they've been playing with that a little bit.

1714
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:31,000
There are still some movies that come out on demand and in theaters the same day.

1715
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:34,000
But a lot of theaters, they give the finger to it.

1716
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:41,000
Yeah right, and I think it's a delicate relationship between the movie studios and the theaters.

1717
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:47,000
Because if they do that, that unfortunately will close a lot of theaters down if they're just...

1718
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
You know, they're not exclusive anymore.

1719
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:57,000
But, you know, for certain movies I'm like, I need to see that in the theater because it's just not gonna be the same watching it at home.

1720
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:00,000
Alright.

1721
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
Anyway, that's it for the mailbag this week.

1722
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:07,000
If you guys want to send us an email for a future week, participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

1723
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:11,000
Squatchkiller in a chat over at live.voguenetwork.com says,

1724
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:17,000
Too expensive to take the whole family these days. I would rather watch a movie at home on a nice TV.

1725
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:18,000
Yeah, I mean that's...

1726
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:21,000
But the theater, the movie industry isn't dying.

1727
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:25,000
I mean, I know a lot of people that feel very similar.

1728
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
And especially, I'm sure, the bigger your family gets.

1729
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
You know, a family of four is gonna be expensive.

1730
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:36,000
If you have more than that, I mean, God, a $70 video game may actually be a cheaper form of entertainment than a night out of the movies.

1731
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
But yet, the movie industry is thriving.

1732
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:46,000
Well, Ian, you can't complain that, you know, the cost per hour of entertainment is gonna be definitely lower on a video game.

1733
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:47,000
Sure.

1734
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:50,000
Because you're gonna get, you know, hundreds of hours of entertainment out of that.

1735
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:51,000
Maybe.

1736
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
At the very least, you're gonna get more than two hours of entertainment.

1737
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:54,000
Yeah, 20. We'll say 20 is the baseline.

1738
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:55,000
At the very least.

1739
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:58,000
So, you know, you're gonna save money that way.

1740
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:02,000
But, like, even with my kids, like, I try taking them to the movies all the time.

1741
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:10,000
But my youngest son, he's too little still to sit through a movie because he wants to crawl over the goddamn, all over the goddamn place.

1742
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:14,000
Like, the last movie we saw was the Lego Ninjago movie.

1743
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
He was fucking everywhere.

1744
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
You need a movie theater with a seatbelt.

1745
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:23,000
It's just like, they'll watch movies, like, they'll watch, like, they've been watching, they've been binge watching.

1746
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
They picked the weirdest shit too.

1747
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
The live action Scooby Doo movies.

1748
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:32,000
Which, now that they've watched them so many times, aren't actually that bad.

1749
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:35,000
They're stupid, but they're as stupid as the show was.

1750
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:39,000
And for what they are, I think they're actually pretty well put together.

1751
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
So, you know, props to them for that.

1752
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:44,000
But, yes, it's a really stupid movie. They'll watch it dozens of times.

1753
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:50,000
Don't those movies have, like, marijuana references all over them too?

1754
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
Oh, God, yes. All the time.

1755
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:55,000
And they have, like, all sorts of small references in there.

1756
01:58:55,000 --> 01:59:00,000
I love kid movies that have humor that only adults will get. That's, like, my favorite.

1757
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:04,000
Yeah, they have, like, all sorts of weird shit, like, sexual, like, tension and shit like that in the second movie.

1758
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
I mean, it's all over the place, but it's-

1759
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
Between Velma and Daphne, right?

1760
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:11,000
Oh, God, Velma, like, no, not even, like, Velma and Daphne.

1761
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:16,000
Like, Velma and, like, Velma and Seth Green in the last movie, the second movie that they had.

1762
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:20,000
But, like, it's, they've got, like, big name stars in it.

1763
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:25,000
It's just, like, I don't know. It's all right. It's not as irritating as I thought it would be.

1764
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:26,000
All right.

1765
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:32,000
You should do quick movie reviews for VOG. It's not as irritating as I thought it would be.

1766
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:35,000
No, seriously, there's some movies, like, seriously, like, you would think.

1767
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:40,000
The Angry Birds movie. That sounds like a shitty fucking idea. It was actually an irritating movie.

1768
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:46,000
Maybe my standards are just lowering that much because I've been forced to watch all these kids' shows.

1769
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:50,000
Loki's review of Angry Birds, the movie. I thought it would be shitty, but it was actually pretty good.

1770
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:54,000
It was actually kind of funny. They had a lot of adult humor in there.

1771
01:59:54,000 --> 02:00:00,000
And also, Bill Hader does voice acting, so I love Bill Hader. Can't hate on the hater.

1772
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:06,000
All right. Let's see if we can hate on the gaming news. I hope not. There's too much hate out there in the gaming industry.

1773
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:07,000
Yes, we can, actually.

1774
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:12,000
Oh, yeah. Now that I just looked up and saw what the first story was, I was like, oops.

1775
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
God, I put my foot in my mouth so bad.

1776
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:24,000
Yes, because this week, if it wasn't about Star Wars and the shitty DLC, it was about, hey, which celebrity is sexually harassing someone now?

1777
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:31,000
Or, hey, let's tie it back in the game industry. IGN. There's, you know, drama going on there.

1778
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:38,000
Apparently, there's, you know, some former employees that have sexually harassed people and some shenanigans that are going on there.

1779
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:51,000
So, you know, basically, they're saying, you know, that they put out a statement saying that there won't be a daily fix today because a large number of groups of IGN employees have refused to work until the company issues a statement.

1780
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:59,000
I apologize regarding what happened to, was it Kaley Plague? I think that's how you say the name.

1781
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:08,000
Saying basically referring to a former coworker who, I guess on Friday, had accused the company of an HR department mistreating her.

1782
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
And so that's their daily show.

1783
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:24,000
They were saying that apparently that they, she had to deal with, I guess, someone that was making, you know, more and more uncomfortable sexually, sexual nature comments to her.

1784
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:31,000
And basically that kind of sounded like the HR department was kind of trying to brush it under the rug type thing.

1785
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:43,000
Just, you know, with the whole Harvey Weinstein thing, everybody's coming out about this stuff. And I'm not surprised. It's everywhere. It's all industries have shitty people in it.

1786
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:50,000
You're not going to find an industry that does not have shitty people in it. And it's just like, God, I hope it's not this person that I really like.

1787
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:58,000
I mean, they had like George Takei, you had, oh God, what's the Senator's name? Al Franken.

1788
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:04,000
Al Franken, you know, they've had lots of different actors that have had...

1789
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:05,000
Turn on a television.

1790
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:08,000
Yeah, I mean, it's just all over the place. Every day, it's something, you know.

1791
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:18,000
Well, unfortunately, this is a result in this whole like garbage parade that's happening right now. And I mean, garbage people being paraded out of these different jobs.

1792
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:28,000
What's happening here is a result of an industry, especially Hollywood, where this shit's been bottled up way too long.

1793
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:29,000
Oh, God, yeah.

1794
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
Collectively, yeah. People are putting their foot down things.

1795
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:35,000
We're just scratching the surface on like the skeletons in the closet in that industry. Oh, God.

1796
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:45,000
And obviously, everything Hollywood bleeds into video games here and there. And it's really not escapable, unfortunately, in any industry.

1797
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:53,000
So, I mean, you're seeing just now, you know, the result of people coming together, putting their collective foot down and saying, we're not taking this shit anymore.

1798
02:02:53,000 --> 02:03:01,000
You know, which also leads to some questions about how much evidence do we need to convict a person?

1799
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:07,000
You know, it's one thing when it's Kevin Spacey and there's, you know, 40 people all lined up to talk about an issue.

1800
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:17,000
But then you got George Kay where it's one. And that's my thing. It's hard. I don't think there's an easy answer to that scenario at all.

1801
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:23,000
And that's my thing, too. And I don't think I've ever put anything out regarding this, but this is basically my opinion on this scenario.

1802
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:29,000
It's not that I want to distrust everybody, but I question everything I read. I question everything because you have to.

1803
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:41,000
Because there's been so many scenarios, not to say that there's not guilty people out there, but there's been so many scenarios where someone is accused of something.

1804
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:51,000
It could be like something sexual assault or sexual abuse or something like that. It comes out, find out later that, oh, it was actually made up and the damages are even done.

1805
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:58,000
Whereas, you know, these people, I agree, people should be coming forward with this stuff, especially if it's happening.

1806
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:04,000
But we shouldn't be so quickly to jump on board and judge these people without having all the facts.

1807
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:10,000
And that's kind of where my issue is, is I'm seeing a lot more people coming out, which is great.

1808
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
I think more people should come out and bring a lot of this stuff to light.

1809
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:18,000
But I'm worried that people are going to get, find, be opportunistic about it and find out.

1810
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:26,000
Because with the Al Franken thing, don't get me wrong, it seems like it's a stretch. He took full responsibility for it as well.

1811
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:33,000
But it seems very political because the person making the accusation is very much affiliated with the conservative movement.

1812
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:40,000
And it's just very kind of the timing of the thing is kind of convenient, but convenient with what's going on with Roy Moore.

1813
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
Sure. Right. It's just very convenient.

1814
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:55,000
So I'm worried that we're going to see more of these things coming out where it's more to kind of attack a person because, well, we don't want to not believe somebody because then you look bad if you don't believe them.

1815
02:04:55,000 --> 02:05:08,000
But I just argue that we should at least show some sort of caution with believing everything that we read until we know all the facts or have more corroborating evidence or something like that.

1816
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:18,000
And this goes for any side. For someone defending themselves and someone making the accusations, we need to know all the facts before we can kind of judge a person.

1817
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:24,000
And not to get too far off topic, but obviously this is a topic that's consumed a lot of the media, as you said recently.

1818
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:35,000
I think we all have to kind of look at this. And I think if we all kind of look at this and go, this is a shitty world. This is not the type of environment.

1819
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:44,000
This is not the type of humanity that we want to be. I think we all have to make a conversation and say, no more. And it starts with you make a conscious effort.

1820
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:52,000
I'm not going to sexually harass somebody. I'm going to teach my children and the people that I influence not to sexually harass people.

1821
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:59,000
And I think that's where it starts. And that's where we're going to have to build this better future because unfortunately we can't fix what's happened in years and years of Hollywood.

1822
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:03,000
We're not going to be able to go back and undo that because that shit does permanent damage.

1823
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:07,000
All we can do is we have to make this better for the next generation.

1824
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:15,000
Or make it easier for people to come forward instead of learning about it 40 years later or, you know, several years later about something that happened in the past.

1825
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:24,000
Find out about it now so we can stop it now instead of, oh, I can't speak up because I'm afraid this will hurt my career or something like that.

1826
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:27,000
Although that's a valid, I mean, we understand why people feel that way.

1827
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:38,000
Let's move on. We got way off topic, but understandably so it is something that's, you know, spilling into the gaming industry, unfortunately.

1828
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:49,000
So, um, you know, just, you need to stop this culture and, uh, it's not cool or any of that stuff, you know, it needs to stop.

1829
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:57,000
All right, moving on. Let's talk about movies, but the type of movie news we like to talk about, and that is video games becoming movies.

1830
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,000
Well, do we like to talk about that? Because usually it doesn't end well.

1831
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:03,000
Well, there's Rampage as a trailer for that, so...

1832
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:06,000
I wasn't feeling the Rampage trailer.

1833
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:09,000
I thought it could, I thought, well...

1834
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:13,000
For me, it still goes back to the question of why do we need this?

1835
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:21,000
Well, the problem like with that movie, at least the trailer, is it didn't seem like it barely tied in with the whole game as it was.

1836
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:26,000
Which I guess is fine. A lot of those 80s games don't exactly have the biggest plot anyway.

1837
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:31,000
But we also have Battleship turned out, which also doesn't have much of a plot to the game.

1838
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:34,000
And then the new Jumanji that's coming out, both also starring The Rock.

1839
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:38,000
What the fuck is with The Rock and being on The Rock? He's rocking the schlock.

1840
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:41,000
I mean, I don't know why he's in all these.

1841
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:48,000
And this movie right here, it's funny because he did a movie just recently called San Andreas, which was kind of schlocky as well.

1842
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:51,000
And it looks very similar to that.

1843
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:55,000
And... I don't know. I mean...

1844
02:07:55,000 --> 02:08:01,000
I'll be interested to hear how it turns out. I just, I don't, I wish it was more like the story of the game.

1845
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:06,000
Well, anyhow, we actually weren't going to talk about the Rampage thing, but there you go.

1846
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:12,000
But I did want to talk about that it looks like a new Mario Brothers movie is going to be attempted.

1847
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:18,000
So we're just going to forget the whole, you know, Dennis Hopper as King Koopa thing never existed.

1848
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:19,000
I can never forget that, though.

1849
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
We're just going to kind of erase that.

1850
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:27,000
Because now they're talking about an animated film and it's going to come from Universal Animation.

1851
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:32,000
Not too outside the realm of possibility because Universal, we know, has already teamed up for the theme park stuff, right?

1852
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:36,000
So it makes sense that if any film studio is going to have dibs on this, it's probably Universal, right?

1853
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:44,000
Universal Animation in talks to make this. Universal Animation, of course, behind Shrek and the Minions.

1854
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:49,000
Which takes me back to a quote from The Good Place.

1855
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000
I won this little yellow demon.

1856
02:08:51,000 --> 02:09:07,000
The Minions, you know, honestly, like having watched the Minions movies several dozen times now, it honestly is very well animated and the story isn't all that bad.

1857
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:14,000
If there's going to be a studio that has to do it, good choice. I see no problem with this.

1858
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:18,000
There's a really good friend of mine, and I'm not going to say who on air.

1859
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:24,000
There's a really good friend of mine. The way I feel about mayonnaise is the way he feels about Minions.

1860
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:31,000
They're not really, I mean, it's a silly movie. Yes, the characters are forced out of their throats because they're fucking everywhere.

1861
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:39,000
But it's not that, I mean, if you actually watch the movies, it's not that annoying. They're actually pretty entertaining.

1862
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:48,000
It's silly, like the whole Minions thing, like the Minions movie was set more like, it's kind of that like, oh.

1863
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:53,000
My friend is not alone. Fifth Dream in chat says, can't fucking stand Minions.

1864
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:59,000
I don't know, it wasn't that bad. Alright, alright, alright. Anyway, film reviews by Loki. It wasn't that bad.

1865
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:07,000
Anyhow, there you go. So that's all we know. This is according to a Wall Street Journal report saying Nintendo and Universal are close to signing the deal.

1866
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:11,000
Which would kind of be a step in a different direction.

1867
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:15,000
Weren't they close to signing a deal with Sony at one time? I mean, I don't know.

1868
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:20,000
But, you know, Nintendo has kind of said they're not going to license their properties for movies anymore.

1869
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:26,000
But, you know, as the years go by. It's been a while. It's been a while and, you know, why not?

1870
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:30,000
If the script is really good, maybe animated is a good place for that to be.

1871
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:34,000
I'd be curious who they get to do the voices. Do you think they'd get Charles Martin native voice Mario? I doubt it.

1872
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:35,000
I hope so.

1873
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:40,000
Unfortunately, and no disrespect to Mr. Charles Martinet who is a fantastic voice acting talent.

1874
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:44,000
The unfortunate thing is, his name on the poster, most people don't know who that is.

1875
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:50,000
They're going to put, they're going to cast somebody like Bill Hader or whoever it is you like.

1876
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
It's going to be like a Saturday Night Live comic.

1877
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:58,000
If Bill Hader wants to do it, he probably could do it. And I'm, Bill Hader can do no wrong.

1878
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:05,000
I'm sorry. It's like he's hilarious. He's a great comedy. He's a great comedy writer and he does great voices and impressions.

1879
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:11,000
So, I have no problem with him doing all of the voices, some of the voices. I think he'd be great.

1880
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:17,000
But no, I'm sure they'll get somebody to do Mario's voice. Millions of people can do Mario's voice.

1881
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:21,000
Hopefully, Charles Martinet gets to do a cameo somewhere, do a voice. That would be very nice.

1882
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:27,000
I don't know why he wouldn't be like considered. I mean, they probably at least have him try out.

1883
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:32,000
Yeah, we'll see. Who knows? Do you hear Mr. Smoosh? He snores when he sleeps.

1884
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:36,000
It's so adorable. Did you hear that?

1885
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
Sort of, yeah.

1886
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:41,000
He's so cute.

1887
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:42,000
It's that squished up nose.

1888
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:43,000
Yeah, it is. It is.

1889
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
All right. Anyhow, moving on. Loki.

1890
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,000
You can hear it, right? It's like super loud.

1891
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,000
I don't want to wake him up. Oh, he's awake.

1892
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:52,000
It happens.

1893
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
I'm going to try to pick it up on the...

1894
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:55,000
That's what cats do.

1895
02:11:55,000 --> 02:12:02,000
All right. Anyways, so HTC announced that they're going to be doing a standalone headset called the Vive Focus.

1896
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:10,000
It's going to basically be like the Oculus headset that they have coming out where it doesn't require a PC or phone.

1897
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:18,000
It's just a headset. It's also very blue looking, which I don't really care for that, but whatevs.

1898
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:25,000
Apparently, they're saying that they're going to be available only in China initially.

1899
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:30,000
They're not really seeing what the pricing is going to be or anything like that.

1900
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:36,000
However, because of this, they're not going to be working with Google, though, on a standalone Daydream headset.

1901
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:46,000
But it will, I guess, apparently work similar to the Vive headset now where it does room scale and all that.

1902
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:53,000
So it'll be interesting to see how much that is and what the games and applications look like on that.

1903
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:57,000
I don't know. I'm still worried about these standalone headsets.

1904
02:12:57,000 --> 02:13:00,000
But I'll check it out.

1905
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:04,000
VR's got to catch on in the mainstream one of these times.

1906
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:07,000
Getting the cost down is the way to do it, though.

1907
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:14,000
It is. And it's funny. I was watching a review on the Acer mixed reality headset that they have,

1908
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:21,000
which mixed reality sounds like it's going to be some augmented reality thing, but it's actually just a VR headset that's for $399.

1909
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:26,000
And originally, their thing was, oh, well, our headset's going to be $399. That's what's going to make it sell.

1910
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:33,000
But then Oculus dropped the price of their headset back in August, and it's like, why is this thing even coming out now?

1911
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:42,000
But I guess the headset quality isn't quite up to what some of these other headsets are.

1912
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:49,000
So I'm more interested in seeing what the next generation of these headsets are going to be come maybe even next year.

1913
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:53,000
I don't know. Soon? Next couple of years?

1914
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:56,000
Soon.

1915
02:13:56,000 --> 02:14:03,000
All right. Well, this website won't work for this story I'm trying to do live.

1916
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:08,000
I can Google it from somewhere else, but I wanted to talk about what's going to be playable at PlayStation Expo.

1917
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:09,000
OK, let's talk about it.

1918
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:13,000
So PlayStation Expo got quite a few different exhibitors.

1919
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:17,000
So starting off with the titles that are going to be there.

1920
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:19,000
Let's see, do they have it's just listing all the titles.

1921
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:23,000
So I'm assuming these are all playable.

1922
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:27,000
So let's see, starting off, we've got 20XX.

1923
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:29,000
OK, we're not reading this entire list.

1924
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:31,000
There's too many. Wait, I'm going to I finally got a list here.

1925
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:35,000
I'm going to look through it. It does look like there's quite a list of games there.

1926
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:37,000
But that's a 20XX. That game is fun.

1927
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:40,000
That's coming out for PlayStation 4. I didn't even know that. That's great.

1928
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
I did a live stream of that a while ago.

1929
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:46,000
This is kind of neat. Aegis Defenders, which apparently is a Humble Bundle game.

1930
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:49,000
Because they're publishing stuff now.

1931
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:51,000
The first expansion to Destiny 2 is going to be there.

1932
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:55,000
DJ Max Respect, which I've been waiting to hear about a North American release for that.

1933
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:58,000
For you music game fans, that'll be fun.

1934
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:05,000
Brawlhalla Fantasy Strike, Street Fighter V Arcade Edition.

1935
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:07,000
Gran Turismo Sport.

1936
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:10,000
Yakuza 6, The Song of Life.

1937
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:14,000
I don't know why, but they're putting all those Uncharted games still out on the floor to play.

1938
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
Because why not? It's Sony show.

1939
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
Monster Hunter World.

1940
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
Shadow of the Colossus.

1941
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:21,000
That'd be really cool.

1942
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:23,000
People waiting to check that out.

1943
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:25,000
Sounds like it's going to be a fun show.

1944
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:28,000
I wish I had room to do one more expo this year.

1945
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:31,000
But I just can't. I'm out of PTO and all that.

1946
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:33,000
Maybe if I hadn't done the Seattle trip.

1947
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:36,000
I don't regret doing that. It was a real relaxing time.

1948
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:39,000
And then I'm looking at the VR titles that they have here.

1949
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
Ungrave looks kind of neat.

1950
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
I don't know what half these are.

1951
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:51,000
Why do they have Resident Evil 7 Biohazard as a VR title?

1952
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:54,000
I mean, it's one of the better titles on VR.

1953
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
Maybe they're adding something to it.

1954
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:59,000
You'll be almost a year old by then.

1955
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:05,000
Honestly, put on Until Dawn Rush of Blood.

1956
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:07,000
Because that game is fucking awesome.

1957
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:09,000
Everybody can just download that to their own system now.

1958
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:11,000
It's so good. I mean, seriously.

1959
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:15,000
If you haven't played it yet, go play it. It's awesome.

1960
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:21,000
Let's get to the next news story and get to the calls soon at Orange Lounge Radio.

1961
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:23,000
All one word on Skype.

1962
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:25,000
We have a couple more stories first though.

1963
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:29,000
Ubisoft, I guess, can kind of breathe a little bit.

1964
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:36,000
Because, apparently, Vividi has said that they're not going to try to take over Ubisoft for at least six months.

1965
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:39,000
So, Vividi has released their third quarter financials.

1966
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:50,000
And, apparently, they're saying that they do not expect to attempt a takeover of Ubisoft until the next half of the financial year.

1967
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:56,000
And, I guess, right now they own 26% in Ubisoft.

1968
02:16:56,000 --> 02:17:09,000
And, I guess, they're saying due to a French accounting law, purchasing another 4% of the company triggers a requirement for Vividi to either purchase the video game publisher or to back off.

1969
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:16,000
So, they're anticipating that Ubisoft granted double voting rights to the majority shareholders.

1970
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:27,000
It'll be interesting to see what happens because I know the last company that they purchased didn't end up doing too well.

1971
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:32,000
Yeah, people were not a fan of this whole takeover news either.

1972
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:35,000
So, I don't know why they're still trying it.

1973
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:38,000
But, I guess, at the end of the day, it doesn't matter what we think. It matters what investors think.

1974
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
It's all about money. It's always money.

1975
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
It's all about the investors and money. It's all about that.

1976
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:46,000
Well, you know what gamers love to end on this note tonight?

1977
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
Gamers love rumors!

1978
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:53,000
That's right. We've got so many rumors to talk about here at the end of the show.

1979
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:56,000
But, that's why I'm putting it at the end of the show because it is just rumors.

1980
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:59,000
Who knows if it's going to be true or not.

1981
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:04,000
This comes from Reddit via a member Das Vergben, if I said that right.

1982
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:07,000
Apparently, a lot of news and rumors.

1983
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:10,000
Now, why do we care about what some rando on Reddit has to say?

1984
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:19,000
Apparently, this same person called the Ninja Turtles in Injustice 2 thing, which I don't think anybody could have predicted.

1985
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:25,000
So, that's why suddenly these rumors are getting a little more credit.

1986
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:31,000
But, what do we think? We're going to measure these on the plausibility scale.

1987
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:33,000
Is it plausible or not?

1988
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:42,000
Number one, a Switch port of Dragon Ball FighterZ is in the works and will likely come out in fall and winter of 2018.

1989
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
I guess.

1990
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:49,000
I say yes, the Switch is doing very well. This makes a lot of sense for this to happen.

1991
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:56,000
Soul Calibur 6 is in development for the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and PC.

1992
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:59,000
It's going to be unveiled at the PlayStation Experience.

1993
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:03,000
Link will return as a guest character on the Switch version.

1994
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:08,000
I mean, if it's going to come out on the Switch, then I would see Link as being a character.

1995
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:11,000
It's kind of boring, though.

1996
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:15,000
No, Link is a guest character. He's been a guest character on every...

1997
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:20,000
Yeah, but Soul Calibur 2 is so awesome with him.

1998
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:23,000
I mean, the GameCube version of that was the must-have.

1999
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:26,000
I would hope that they have more guest characters than just one, how about that?

2000
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:30,000
Well, the interesting thing, though, about... I mean, one thing you got to point out, there was Soul Calibur 6.

2001
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
No Xbox in that.

2002
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:35,000
And who knows if that's online play, although they...

2003
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:38,000
Sony's the one that's holding out on that now, so I don't know if maybe...

2004
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
Yeah, I doubt it would be online play.

2005
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:44,000
Maybe they're agreeing to do it with Nintendo and just not Microsoft.

2006
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:49,000
Or the fact that the game is, you know, Japanese-developed and Microsoft's a non-factor in Japan now.

2007
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:51,000
So, it'll be interesting.

2008
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:55,000
But, I mean, I would think a sixth Soul Calibur has to happen at some point.

2009
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:58,000
So, that alone seems like, yeah, that would make a lot of sense.

2010
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
That would be a cool game to reveal.

2011
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:05,000
Especially with, you know, a lot of people really into Tekken 7 right now.

2012
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:11,000
I'd be curious who would be the guest characters on the other platforms.

2013
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:14,000
PC and Sony.

2014
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:20,000
Would they just go back and do Heihachi again on PlayStation and then maybe Spawn moves to PC?

2015
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:25,000
Instead of being Microsoft? Well, which I guess, well, in a way, PC is Microsoft, so...

2016
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:26,000
Who knows?

2017
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:31,000
I don't know if they'd do Spawn. Who even likes Spawn nowadays?

2018
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:36,000
Bob Coffee says, not gonna happen. Not until Harada is done with Tekken 7.

2019
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:37,000
Alright.

2020
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:40,000
Whatever happened to Tekken Cross Street Fighter? Is that ever gonna happen?

2021
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
Yeah, whatever happened to that?

2022
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:48,000
There has been pressure on Game Freak to get Pokemon's 8th generation out in hopes of a release next year.

2023
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:59,000
If you recall Pokemon Stars, that is or was real, but all it was was a Sun and Moon port to the Switch used as an engine test tech demo thing.

2024
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:01,000
In my opinion, that's a whole lot of nothing.

2025
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:04,000
That there's really nothing that can be amounted from that.

2026
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:08,000
Because the new Pokemon game might be out next year.

2027
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:11,000
Of course they're gonna try to push to get it out next year. Why wouldn't they?

2028
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:17,000
But as far as there's this tech demo thing that may or may not actually exist, I don't think we'll ever know on that one.

2029
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:20,000
So there's really a whole lot of nothing with that.

2030
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:27,000
Metroid Prime 4 should have something revealed with in-game footage early next year.

2031
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:34,000
Direct in January, Bandai Namco is developing the game for Nintendo.

2032
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:37,000
Unknown which development studio?

2033
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:42,000
That's a pretty big one. Bandai Namco could actually be developing the game for Nintendo.

2034
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:43,000
Hmm.

2035
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:46,000
What do you think? Plausible? Not plausible.

2036
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:50,000
We'll see something eventually. Probably by E3 next year.

2037
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:56,000
I think this is a very safe bet, but I think January may be too early for a direct on that.

2038
02:21:56,000 --> 02:22:01,000
Okay, hold on, because Mr. Smoosh is scratching the couch. I don't want him to scratch the couch.

2039
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:03,000
Stop scratching the couch. Alright.

2040
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:05,000
Let's cut the nails off and then you won't have that problem.

2041
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:06,000
No, I'm not gonna declaw the kitty.

2042
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
No, you don't declaw the kitty, just...

2043
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
Oh, oh, file the nails. Yeah.

2044
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:13,000
I'm trying to get him to use the scratching post to do that.

2045
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:17,000
Yeah, I know. We're gonna have to... or get him those little nail holder things.

2046
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:20,000
I have to look into how, you know, if...

2047
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:23,000
I just trim my cat's nails. Usually it's because she uses it on me.

2048
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:29,000
And so when she's laying on me, she needs and it's like, stop clawing into my arm.

2049
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:31,000
Like, I'll look at my arm and there's like scratches all down it.

2050
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:35,000
See, Sanrio was very good about using the scratching post, so she never really had a problem.

2051
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:38,000
But I think we might be challenged a little bit with this one.

2052
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:39,000
That's alright.

2053
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:42,000
Sorry I keep talking about the cat, but it's brand new.

2054
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
He just got here yesterday.

2055
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:45,000
And it doesn't hide from us.

2056
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:48,000
You know, the kitty doesn't hide from us. All kitty wants to be here front and center.

2057
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:51,000
If we ever do go video, you're gonna see him through the whole show.

2058
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:54,000
Alright, let's see. What else do we have here?

2059
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:58,000
Mother 3 is real. It was localized and playable.

2060
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:04,000
It is being held back for some reason, which all I know has something to do with not knowing which month to release it in.

2061
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:07,000
That sounds not plausible.

2062
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:08,000
That sounds like a whole bunch of bullshit.

2063
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:16,000
It does. Because, okay, sure, Mother 3 is maybe done, probably done, tested, but this whole, they don't know what month to release it in?

2064
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:17,000
What?

2065
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:18,000
That's bullshit.

2066
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,000
I don't believe that part.

2067
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:23,000
Let's see. And lastly, here's another big one.

2068
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:27,000
Blizzard is preparing a Hearthstone port for the Switch.

2069
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:29,000
I heard about this when I went to Blizzcon.

2070
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:34,000
I guess it's plausible. Unity ports to the Switch, so why not?

2071
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:42,000
It might die down some of the people that want Overwatch to come to the Switch if Blizzard does support the Switch with Hearthstone.

2072
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:50,000
It makes sense for the Switch more than other platforms because of the touchscreen, which, you know, it does with mobile.

2073
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:55,000
I don't know. I guess it makes sense if that's, yeah.

2074
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:56,000
It's something it would be able to run.

2075
02:23:56,000 --> 02:24:02,000
Although it does seem a little fan wanky to me, but I think it would be a good idea.

2076
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:05,000
I think that could be a win-win situation, but we'll see.

2077
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:06,000
So.

2078
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:11,000
Alright, and Bobby Blackwolf says, all Blizzard needs to put out on the Switch is rock and roll racing.

2079
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:13,000
Alright, there you go for rumors this week.

2080
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:14,000
Let's get to the Skype line.

2081
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:17,000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

2082
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:25,000
If you want to give us a call and share your thoughts on anything we've talked about or maybe haven't gotten around to yet on the news this week.

2083
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:29,000
I'm gonna ask Loki over there if he has any last minute stories that he wants to get to.

2084
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:30,000
I don't.

2085
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:31,000
Uh oh.

2086
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:34,000
I gotta buy time here somehow.

2087
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:38,000
Is there any games that you're hoping to pick up during this holiday season?

2088
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:41,000
I'd be curious to see what's on sale on the Steam sales and stuff.

2089
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:46,000
I really have a huge backlog, though, and I'm very aware of that.

2090
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:54,000
If anything, it may be the South Park game, but I'm really trying not to pick up too many games because I buy them and then I don't end up playing them.

2091
02:24:55,000 --> 02:25:01,000
I want to finish the LEGO game right now just so that my kids can play the free mode because that's really all they want to play.

2092
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:06,000
They're not good at cooperating, so I can't have them play the actual game.

2093
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:10,000
I don't know.

2094
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:17,000
Maybe I'd like to still get LEGO Dimensions, but it's really fucking expensive and it's still hard to find that stuff.

2095
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:21,000
It's hard to find the LEGO Dimensions stuff now?

2096
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:22,000
It is.

2097
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:23,000
They don't sell it anymore.

2098
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:25,000
I guess a lot of places must have unloaded it.

2099
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:27,000
A lot of places have unloaded it or they haven't worked it down.

2100
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:30,000
One more shout out for the Skype line, OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype.

2101
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:38,000
And then, of course, you know, I have to work on developing my game because I haven't been doing that for weeks now.

2102
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:40,000
Hey, the phones are lighting up, so let's get to it.

2103
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

2104
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:43,000
Yo, what's up, guys? This is SkyJudo.

2105
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:45,000
Hey, SkyJudo. What's up, buddy?

2106
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:51,000
I want to talk about the email that you got. I can't remember the person's name, sorry, but they were talking about the digital versus physical.

2107
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:53,000
I believe that was Retertainment.

2108
02:25:53,000 --> 02:26:01,000
All right, well, for a long time, I've been somebody who's always said, you know, buy physical. I don't want to deal with digital.

2109
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:07,000
And one of the main reasons is because I notice how much space a lot of these games take up on your hard drive.

2110
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:18,000
And now I'm kind of flipping a little bit because I feel like digital and physical are like one and the same now because they all download to your hard drive now.

2111
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:24,000
So you're not really saving, in my case, I'm not really saving any space on my hard drive.

2112
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:32,000
So normally I just go with digital just because I'm like, I notice that some of my games I like the most, that I play the most, like, what is it?

2113
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:40,000
Fight Night Champions on Xbox 360. That thing has like a little crack in the center of the disc.

2114
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:48,000
And I'm just like, you know, I've noticed this with my other games, so I'm like, why even bother with a game that's going to crack, get scratched up when I can just go digital, have it there?

2115
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:52,000
Because it's basically going to take up the same amount of space that it would if I had it on disc.

2116
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:57,000
Like the only games I will buy now are like games that I want a physical copy, like I want to collect them, whatever.

2117
02:26:57,000 --> 02:27:02,000
Like I just got the Pokemon Ultra Sun and Moon. That I would never get digital.

2118
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:08,000
I always get the, you know, I love having a little, you know, a little cartridge, put them with the rest of my collection, that type of thing.

2119
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:15,000
You know, there's some other games like that for PlayStation 4 and the other like CD systems, but I'm finding myself buying a lot more digital now.

2120
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:20,000
Yeah, you know, I don't know. I still tend to do physical and a lot of that is because of price.

2121
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:29,000
And because I do have Amazon Prime, which they sure don't warn you when your year's about up on that because my thing got charged for that all of a sudden.

2122
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:34,000
I was like, when did it go up to like a hundred bucks? But I'll still use it throughout the year.

2123
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:42,000
So with the shipping and the Twitch Prime and everything that comes with it, but one other thing that you get is the discount on newer games.

2124
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:46,000
So honestly, I get physical games cheaper because I buy them through Amazon Prime.

2125
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:48,000
So it's actually cheaper if you need to get it than digital.

2126
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:55,000
Are you really getting them? I mean, because like I don't do a lot of online shopping. Like I go right into the GameStop, pick up my game that way.

2127
02:27:55,000 --> 02:28:03,000
So are you really saving that much money or are you basically spending around the same price that you would normally spend if you just walk into a store and physically bought it?

2128
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:06,000
Twenty percent is what I'm saving. So...

2129
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:09,000
With the shipping and handling and all that stuff, because I know the shipping gets crazy.

2130
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:12,000
No, if you have Amazon Prime, you're not paying anything.

2131
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:19,000
Well, it's a double-edged sword. You're paying the hundred bucks for Amazon Prime, but you never pay shipping for anything throughout the year.

2132
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:28,000
And I take it that you buy a lot of games, but you're not just buying like games a year or something. I guess it pays for you.

2133
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:36,000
It does, yeah. For me, it ends up paying for itself. And then I get the Amazon TV and the Twitch stuff and everything else they have involved with that.

2134
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:41,000
But to be fair, I know a lot of people have been having problems with Amazon, like serious problems.

2135
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:46,000
We heard Act Deft call in a couple weeks ago with him getting fucked around on the SNES Classic.

2136
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:53,000
So Amazon is not infallible. So far for me, I've never had a problem with them, knock on wood.

2137
02:28:54,000 --> 02:29:00,000
But what if Amazon's not around anymore? How do you see yourself purchasing your games?

2138
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:10,000
Like, if you had to go the route that I'm going where I'm walking in the store and getting it, or I'm buying it off of my PlayStation or something like that, what would you do?

2139
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:15,000
I would still probably shop around a little bit for the best special.

2140
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:18,000
Right. No, I'm joking.

2141
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:48,000
I remember the last time I bought a physical PC release.

2142
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:51,000
Good luck trying to buy a physical PC release.

2143
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:59,000
Nowadays, if you buy a physical PC release, a lot of times they just come with a Steam code inside of it. What's the point?

2144
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:03,000
But it is worth saying, I do buy digital when it's PC.

2145
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:16,000
One of my prized possessions is I have a freaking Torchlight. I got it on disc somehow. I didn't even know this game was on disc. I just found it in a freaking basket at GameStop.

2146
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:21,000
I just found a hidden gem. You rarely see any PC games on the shelf.

2147
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:27,000
Unfortunately, the value of that's about to go up with the whole studio getting closed, which is a bummer.

2148
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:34,000
I don't think I would ever sell it. I love Torchlight. I was just surprised I actually had a physical copy of it because I had already bought it off of Steam.

2149
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:42,000
With the physical, I think they gave me a ferret or something, so you get a different animal with the CD version.

2150
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:46,000
There you go. See, it's all about what little extras, what little extra things are there.

2151
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:55,000
For me, it's taking up space. That's my whole thing, preserving space on my hard drive. Now I'm glad at the PlayStation 4 you can use an external hard drive.

2152
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:59,000
That's always been my main issue with the physical thing.

2153
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:04,000
Thanks for taking my call. I'll let some more people get in.

2154
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:07,000
Good question. That was a good topic. Take care, my friend.

2155
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:09,000
Bye, man.

2156
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:12,000
OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype, if you want to give us a call.

2157
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:27,000
Yeah, I have friends that do the Best Buy thing, and they really like it.

2158
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:34,000
I haven't been convinced to get it because I kind of feel like, well, Amazon matches it for all but amiibos, really.

2159
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:42,000
The only amiibo I've bought in the past few months is that Princess Peach amiibo, and I bought that amiibo for one specific reason.

2160
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:45,000
That it's a well-made amiibo.

2161
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:53,000
MXC in chat says, visual novels get a surprising amount of physical PC releases, often still with a disc and a downloadable key.

2162
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:56,000
There's a lot of physical collectors in the fandom.

2163
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:59,000
That's true. There are still some physical PC releases.

2164
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:05,000
There's so much that's digitally done because the storefronts like Steam and Humble and so forth.

2165
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:11,000
Last call for any phone calls tonight, OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word on Skype.

2166
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:15,000
I can't believe we're about, what, a month away from the holidays. Crazy.

2167
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:20,000
We are planning on being here for all the shows throughout December.

2168
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:23,000
I forgot to look at what day the holidays fall on this year.

2169
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:27,000
I want to say Christmas Eve might have been a Sunday coming up. I got to look at my calendar again.

2170
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:32,000
Yeah, Christmas Eve is a Sunday this year, so I don't necessarily know when to do a show that night.

2171
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:39,000
But I'm going to hope, because New Year's Eve will be on a Sunday too, and I am not going to want to do a show on New Year's Eve.

2172
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:45,000
Sorry guys, I know a countdown show would be fun, but hopefully we can maybe do a show at a different day in the week.

2173
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:47,000
That might be what we end up doing.

2174
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:49,000
What about earlier in the day?

2175
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:50,000
On New Year's Eve?

2176
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:55,000
I could be talked into that if Jamie wants to do that too, because I don't really think I'll go out of town.

2177
02:32:55,000 --> 02:33:01,000
Maybe that could be a day we do a show timed for overseas folks, because we've talked about doing that for a while.

2178
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:02,000
Like, do a noon show.

2179
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:03,000
Yeah, that'd be fun.

2180
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:04,000
Yeah, that'd be fun.

2181
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:06,000
Besides, don't we...

2182
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,000
Maybe see if Bobby wants to do it, not him.

2183
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:13,000
I don't remember when we decided that we're doing this, but don't we have a time capsule to open?

2184
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:17,000
We do. That'll be the New Year's Eve show, probably, at the end of the year.

2185
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:20,000
We do have the time capsule.

2186
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:22,000
Honestly, I forgot what's in it.

2187
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:24,000
I forgot what's in it too.

2188
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:26,000
I don't even remember what the fucking prompt was for that time.

2189
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,000
I think it was just like, end of the year predictions.

2190
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:30,000
We should probably have written down on a piece of paper.

2191
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,000
I remember we were already getting tweets like,

2192
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:36,000
Really? You're doing end of the year predictions? Like six months into the year?

2193
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:39,000
That is the attention span of gamers.

2194
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:44,000
I could go back and listen to the episode and I'd hear everything that's in there, but that would defeat the fun.

2195
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:47,000
Look, even in the chat, DarkTit2e is like, Oh yeah.

2196
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:50,000
And S2100matt's like, I forgot as well.

2197
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,000
Alright.

2198
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:58,000
So yeah, we will open it on the New Year's Eve show.

2199
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:04,000
Whether we do that on New Year's Eve or we do it a couple days before to allow our host to have the whole day off.

2200
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:08,000
We'll see. I need to talk to Miss Sakura about that one.

2201
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:13,000
But, I feel like earlier in the day on New Year's Eve will probably work for everybody.

2202
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:15,000
I think that'll be a lot of fun.

2203
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:18,000
So, anyhow, that is going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

2204
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:21,000
Thank you guys so much for listening to our show tonight.

2205
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:25,000
If you enjoyed what you heard here at the show, or even if you didn't, but you know somebody who might like it,

2206
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:28,000
tell a friend or two or fifty about the show.

2207
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:31,000
Help us spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,

2208
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:34,000
but only if the gamers are here to share their voices.

2209
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:37,000
We really appreciate a five star review wherever you found this podcast,

2210
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:41,000
especially places like iTunes, Android, all those go a long way,

2211
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:47,000
especially if you write a little blurb that's like, Rob is great, Jamie is awesome, Loki is okay.

2212
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:51,000
Those five star reviews go a long, long way. We really appreciate it.

2213
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:55,000
And, yeah, tell a friend. That's all we ask.

2214
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:58,000
Thank you to our live crowd for being here, live Sunday nights.

2215
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:01,000
Thank you to our podcast crowd for listening to us throughout the week.

2216
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:03,000
We appreciate you both.

2217
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:06,000
Thank you so much for being here and supporting independent podcasting.

2218
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:11,000
Even if you didn't like this show, we hope you'll support some independent podcaster that's out there.

2219
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:15,000
Because Mr. Smoosh told you to, didn't he? Didn't he, Mr. Smoosh?

2220
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:18,000
Alright, let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

2221
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,000
Loki, your final thought tonight?

2222
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:27,000
My final thought is, hopefully we'll play my VR games this week, because I have a backlog of them.

2223
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:29,000
And there's so many to play.

2224
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:33,000
And then my final thought for tonight is, I hope I get more sleep tonight,

2225
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:38,000
and Mr. Smoosh doesn't keep me up late like he did last night, jumping up on the bed and stuff.

2226
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:41,000
But that's the joys of having a cat now that's a lot younger.

2227
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:43,000
Three years is what the vet estimates.

2228
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:50,000
Three years old as opposed to a seventeen year old that couldn't give a single solitary fuck about trying to jump up on anything.

2229
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:52,000
So, there you go.

2230
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:54,000
He knows. He knows.

2231
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:57,000
Like, the minute he started snoring, I was like, oh god, I wish I could pick that up on the mic.

2232
02:35:57,000 --> 02:36:00,000
But the minute Loki, like, shifts in his chair, he perks up.

2233
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:02,000
Like, what are you doing, asshole?

2234
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:04,000
Alright.

2235
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:07,000
Does Mr. Smoosh have a final thought tonight?

2236
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:11,000
No, he's being shy. Alright.

2237
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:14,000
That's gonna do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2238
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:16,000
Have a great night, everybody. We'll see you next time. Bye.

2239
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:48,000
See you next week.

2240
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:20,000
Thanks for watching!
