7000	13000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	19000	This week Bungie gets caught with its hand in the cookie jar by displaying one set of experience points earned but granting another.
19000	22000	They reportedly disabled this behavior but imply it could be back to changes.
22000	27000	There's plenty more news and it all starts right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36000	39000	It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight.
39000	45000	November the 26th of 2017 with episode number 708 of our show.
45000	50000	Joining you live over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
50000	59000	Myself, Rob Roberts, also known as Skie on Twitter with my co-hosts say hello over there to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
59000	62000	Why do they always want the fish that I don't have?
62000	66000	Who may or may not be addicted to a certain cell phone game we're going to talk about later.
66000	67000	Don't you judge me.
67000	69000	How was your fundraiser last week? We missed you.
69000	77000	It went really well. We managed to donate a little over $300 to the Sacramento AIDS Foundation.
77000	78000	That's great.
78000	82000	And played bingo and gave away lots of fabulous prizes.
82000	87000	There you go. Fabulous prizes? Shoot, I should have canceled on the show too.
87000	91000	It was for a good cause and a lot of people can benefit from the work that we did.
91000	96000	I totally said last week if she's going to miss a show, raising money for charity is a pretty good excuse.
96000	97000	So there you go.
97000	103000	And it is that season and I hope everybody here in the States, if you are listening to us here, I hope you had a great Thanksgiving.
104000	111000	And I know this goes down cheesy, but we are really thankful that you guys, some of you tune in live on Sunday nights at vognetwork.com
111000	115000	and participate in our chat room, which I'll plug more thoroughly in a minute here.
115000	118000	Some of you participate with our podcast stuff.
118000	121000	Some of you have been doing this stuff for years and I have no idea that you're out there
121000	124000	because we never hear from you on Twitter or email or any of that stuff.
124000	125000	We want to hear from you.
125000	127000	Well, yeah, we would love to, but at the same time-
127000	129000	Come forward, stalkers.
129000	134000	I respect the internet anxiety of not wanting to say hello because I've been there too.
134000	135000	So no worries.
135000	144000	But I do want to say thank you for supporting the show because this show did not run for 15 years on, you know, nothing.
144000	147000	It ran on kitty kisses and sheet cakes.
147000	149000	That feedback is very important.
149000	156000	Yes, kitty kisses, now that we have over there, officially his name is, because many of you have been asking since last week's show,
156000	159000	Mr. Smoosh is our new kitty's name.
159000	166000	So, and by the way, in true 2017, what do you call it? I'm not millennial. I'm not Gen X.
166000	168000	It's Shellennial. What is the new one?
168000	169000	No, it's Zennial.
169000	170000	Zennial, okay.
170000	171000	With an X.
171000	177000	In true Zennial fashion, I have set up an Instagram account for Mr. Smoosh, which you can follow.
177000	179000	And it is at Mr. Smoosh.
179000	182000	I haven't even done that for Midna yet, although she has a Tumblr.
182000	184000	You have to spell it out, M-I-S-T-E-R, Smoosh.
184000	186000	I have one for Midna, a Tumblr.
186000	189000	Do you know one of the first people that followed Mr. Smoosh on Instagram?
189000	190000	Hm.
190000	191000	TR's dogs.
191000	192000	Hobbit dogs?
192000	193000	Yeah, the Hobbit dogs.
193000	194000	Alright.
194000	198000	Anyway, I have to say hello over there, of course, to Tech Master Loki.
198000	199000	Hello.
199000	200000	Hi, Loki, how are you?
200000	201000	I'm doing okay.
201000	203000	Have you set up Instagram accounts for your cats?
203000	210000	No, because Facebook wants me to set up an Instagram account for myself, and I'm like, fuck off, I don't want to do this.
210000	215000	And then, like, I get friend requests on Instagram, and it's like, oh, you got some friends that want to follow you on Instagram?
215000	218000	I don't have a fucking Instagram account, stop trying to tell me I do.
218000	222000	Like, I purposely shut this off, and you put it back on.
222000	225000	We made one for you out of convenience, don't you want to Instagram?
225000	229000	Don't you want to follow Mr. Smoosh on Instagram, you heartless beast?
229000	233000	I'm sure it'll do it anyways, whether I want to or not.
233000	237000	I know, I'm just waiting to see the whole, don't you want Mr. Smoosh to get a Facebook?
237000	242000	It's like, Mr. Smoosh is a cat. They're not allowed to have Facebooks. Anyway.
242000	246000	About time I got a horse mackerel.
246000	248000	Todd, you and this Animal Crossing thing.
248000	251000	Alright, we're definitely going to talk about the Animal Crossing mobile game.
251000	254000	I do want to get into our kickoff topic, which will be about that, actually.
254000	261000	But first, I do want to acknowledge our chat room over at live.voggenetwork.com, because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network.
261000	267000	voggenetwork.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
267000	269000	My cat had a live journal.
269000	272000	Did your cat? That's right, your cat did have a live journal.
272000	275000	It still technically does, because I don't think I ever did anything with it.
275000	277000	Well now it's owned by the Russians.
277000	278000	Yes.
278000	283000	But that's, you know. Alright, looking in chat, let's see, Tiger Claw in chat says,
283000	289000	So I heard you went to PetSmart, did they have any Black Friday deals, say on kitty litter and such?
289000	295000	Actually, no. Here's the thing, we went to PetSmart because we just, you know, we've only had Mr. Smoosh for a week.
295000	300000	So there's still some supplies, and I notice Alan really spoils this cat.
300000	305000	I mean, we spoiled Sanrio and Maruko when they were here too, but we really spoiled this cat.
305000	310000	And we, is he smooshing your hand? That's why we call him Mr. Smoosh, Starks, Ira.
310000	312000	Okay, it's not just the face, but the hand.
312000	318000	Anyway, so we went to PetSmart and we were trying to get, I don't even remember, oh yeah.
318000	327000	Oh, we had to get a, we had to get a litter box with big walls on it because Mr. Smoosh really likes to kick litter.
327000	331000	And it was all over the floor in the old litter box. We had to get a litter box with high walls.
331000	334000	And I was actually kind of looking around like, oh, I wonder what's on sale because it's Black Friday.
334000	340000	I don't think a single damn thing was on sale, but does a store like PetSmart need to have sales? Like.
340000	343000	I can give him Midna's taco costume.
343000	350000	You will starve before you let your pet starve. That's the way a lot of people, not everybody, but most people are like that.
350000	353000	Most pet owners I know would let themselves starve before they would let their pet starve.
353000	357000	And I would just, you know, they're going to, they're going to always buy the pet essentials.
357000	361000	What you will notice, Mr. Smoosh, we bought a purple sparkly bow tie.
361000	364000	So that would be the special that we bought. We bought him a purple sparkly bow tie.
364000	368000	And he actually let us put it on him and he kept it on. It's so adorable. Anyway.
369000	372000	Enough about cats. Let's talk about video games.
372000	376000	Actually, something a little more important than both those things, actually.
376000	378000	I wanted to address this at the top of the show.
378000	385000	And since I know you all are tech savvy enough to subscribe to podcasts and you probably use social media one form or another,
385000	391000	I'm sure you've all heard about this by now, but I do want to stress this whole net neutrality thing. Okay?
391000	397000	So if you haven't heard, well, and to be fair, we have listeners that live in other countries.
397000	399000	So maybe they haven't heard.
399000	405000	So they're trying to backtrack on what's called net neutrality laws here in the States.
405000	408000	And I'm going to really like grossly oversimplify things.
408000	413000	But basically we had a law that was signed into effect a few years ago that basically says
413000	418000	internet providers cannot discriminate and treat some traffic different than others.
418000	426000	A great example before this law was in, AT&T would not let you use FaceTime on the iPhone
426000	433000	unless you paid for like a more souped up type of plan because my assumption is that AT&T saw this as competition.
433000	439000	Well, what ended up happening is that all these other knockoff video chat apps really took off and people were using Skype and stuff.
439000	447000	And then net neutrality laws came into place and AT&T couldn't do that anymore because they couldn't charge more or less than one thing for another.
447000	454000	And so what's happening now is that our current administration, the current FCC chief has basically promised...
454000	455000	You mean Sir Shithead?
455000	463000	Well, I try not to get political on this show, but honestly this net neutrality thing is something that I see people on both sides
463000	468000	understand why we have net neutrality and why it would be bad that it went away.
468000	471000	So I kind of feel like this is kind of okay.
471000	477000	As a person who lives on the internet, I think this is pretty clear cut and dry.
477000	484000	From one element, I understand in a way what Comcast, at least what they're trying to say is the reason for this.
484000	490000	Comcast is trying to say what they're trying to stop happening is basically illegal traffic.
490000	492000	They want to be able to stop BitTorrent.
492000	499000	To be fair, I get that. I'm not going to defend piracy of Game of Thrones and shit like that.
499000	501000	That part of it I'm not going to defend.
501000	503000	BitTorrent isn't illegal traffic. BitTorrent is a client.
503000	507000	Bingo. Bingo. And here's where we get into...
507000	509000	Let's just block all web browsers.
509000	513000	And that's where I get into, I don't know if I trust Comcast.
513000	515000	I don't know if I trust anyone to do this right.
515000	519000	Because what is going to be the algorithm that shows if something is illegal or not?
519000	524000	And let me tell you, having this podcast that we do here at Orange Lounge Radio
524000	527000	and having the Voice Geeks Network, vognetwork.com,
527000	533000	we've been doing this show for over 15 years and nobody takes us seriously still.
533000	536000	Which, you know, it's fine. Whatever. We're hobbyists.
537000	541000	I gave up on the prospect of getting famous from this a long time ago and that's fine.
541000	544000	We have a small family here that we love and adore and that's awesome.
544000	551000	But the reason why I say that is that let's say that internet radio is deemed a form of piracy.
553000	557000	Well, who's to say that they're not going to suddenly block VOG Network or something like that?
557000	560000	And what if there's these broad strokes?
560000	563000	Oh, there's this giant download of an MP3.
563000	568000	It must be the new Taylor Swift album and these things start getting blocked.
568000	571000	And you might think I'm being a little bit crazy here,
571000	577000	but I think the precedent is there with what happens on YouTube and their automated algorithms
577000	580000	is you see shit that shouldn't be getting blocked all of the time.
580000	582000	And I understand that YouTube...
582000	585000	Well, just this week, whole channels were deleted.
585000	586000	Yeah.
586000	588000	For sure. For sure.
588000	590000	Konan's channel was deleted.
591000	594000	I want to say there were some other big YouTubers.
594000	597000	There's a ton of channels just like, boop, gone.
597000	603000	So anyhow, the long story short, if this whole net neutrality repeal happens,
603000	606000	it's not going to be pretty.
606000	610000	I do think some of the graphics you see out there on the internet
610000	616000	where ISPs would charge $5 for Facebook and $5 for gaming and all that stuff,
616000	622000	I don't know, I'm a little bit apprehensive as to if that would really happen to that degree.
622000	626000	But, hold on before you get out your pitchforks,
626000	633000	but this whole thing with the loot boxes we've been talking about ad nauseum on the show for the past couple weeks
633000	638000	has just gone to show that companies in it for profit,
638000	640000	be it video game companies or cable companies,
640000	643000	they'll dip their big toe in the water trying to nickel and dime you.
643000	646000	And if that works, they'll put their foot in the water trying to nickel and dime you,
646000	649000	and then they'll put their leg in, and then they'll put the whole waste...
649000	651000	You know what I'm getting at here?
651000	656000	We might go back to this whole AT&T just kind of does the FaceTime thing first,
656000	658000	and then kind of see what happens there.
658000	660000	Or, oh, we're only going to block Bittorrent.
660000	666000	But that means that independent games that are free, that are distributed via Bittorrent,
666000	668000	are also going to get impacted.
668000	670000	And then where is that going to lead to?
670000	674000	It's going to lead to another file transfer service that someone's going to make.
674000	677000	I mean, it's just like how they want to basically say,
677000	680000	listen, we want to write to be able to throttle stuff,
680000	683000	but don't worry, we're not going to throttle anything. Trust us.
683000	685000	If you don't want to throttle anybody,
685000	691000	then why are you fighting and paying so much money to politicians to throttle stuff?
691000	698000	History has shown us that in terms of money-making facilities for profit companies,
698000	701000	they will murder to get their bottom line.
701000	705000	I mean, you want to look just even as far back as 100 years ago.
705000	708000	You know, look at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire.
708000	710000	Look at the molasses flood.
710000	717000	I mean, we've got history on our side that shows that companies will pretty reasonably,
717000	720000	once you give them an inch, they will take a mile.
720000	723000	And Bobby Blackwolf in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,
724000	729000	The only reason it can happen here is because we don't exactly have regional competition for ISPs,
729000	731000	so the free market can't work it out. Exactly.
731000	733000	Comcast is the only option here.
733000	737000	I had a guy come to the door, just not even within the past week, going,
737000	741000	Oh, hey, we're trying to be a competitor to Comcast in this area,
741000	744000	and we wanted to know if you'd be interested in switching.
744000	745000	We got some great deals.
745000	747000	And I was like, I was actually into it for some like,
747000	749000	Oh, great, Comcast has a competitor.
749000	751000	Well, tell me about your internet packages.
751000	755000	And he's like, Oh, well, actually, we only compete with them with television.
755000	757000	We don't have a high speed internet service yet.
757000	760000	And I'm like, God damn it, that's the one thing I was willing to let.
760000	762000	I don't give a shit about TV anymore.
762000	767000	It's like Comcast or AT&T, and it's like AT&T are high speed six megabits.
767000	769000	But I would be, you know what?
769000	774000	I would be willing to go to high speed six megabits, which means backwards, a big step,
774000	776000	to have open internet.
776000	778000	But it won't be.
778000	779000	I know it won't. I know it won't.
779000	786000	And again, to fully kind of go with what I'm going with here with what Bobby said,
786000	787000	you know, he's right.
787000	791000	In most areas, Comcast is your only option, or whatever the provider is in your area,
791000	793000	is the only option.
793000	794000	And here's my thing.
794000	800000	Does Comcast believe enough in this that it's willing to split itself up
800000	803000	so that we can have competition so that the free market can regulate itself?
803000	805000	Because I bet the answer to that is no.
805000	807000	No, they already have agreed.
807000	808000	Trying to get bigger.
808000	810000	Yeah, they're letting them get bigger with different things.
810000	819000	I mean, they've taken back a lot of different regulations that were in place to stop these monopolies.
819000	829000	It's all, he's basically, as they would put it, the FCC is a compromise agency, basically.
829000	834000	So it's under control now by these big companies.
834000	839000	So obviously, anything that they're doing, he's getting a big payout at the end somehow.
839000	844000	So anyway, and what does this have to do with games?
844000	846000	Because I'll tell you what.
846000	852000	If there was ever something that is a premium Xbox Live, PlayStation Network, Nintendo Network,
852000	857000	those are going to be the first things up for an additional fee.
857000	859000	Those would be the first things as a gamer.
859000	862000	What does this mean to you if you're not in the U.S.?
862000	863000	Well, you know what?
863000	868000	A lot of the content you guys consume, including this particular show, a lot of it comes from the U.S.
868000	874000	So absolutely, this could have a trickle effect on what happens in other countries as well.
874000	876000	So anyhow, I know...
876000	882000	Communications needs to be, I mean, maybe not with the current administration,
882000	888000	but I strongly feel that there needs to be, that instead of privatizing it, it needs to be...
889000	891000	Crap, what's the word I was thinking of?
891000	897000	Brought under, I would probably say even just government agency.
897000	898000	Well, that's I think what they're doing now.
898000	904000	They're trying to bring it under the FTC, but I don't think that they have enough manpower to be able to regulate all that.
904000	910000	Well, honestly enough, I believe that our country itself is too big to govern properly, but that's a whole other...
910000	911000	A whole other Oprah.
911000	914000	Anyway, which by the way, did you know Oprah had a podcast?
914000	915000	I didn't learn that until this week and I was like...
915000	917000	Must not have been very good.
917000	920000	Actually, she had an interview with Joe Biden that was really good.
920000	923000	You know what? We've been doing this longer than Oprah, okay?
923000	927000	That is true. We have been podcasting longer than Oprah, but I did...
927000	934000	I'm not going to lie to you. I did have that moment of, well, if Oprah is podcasting now, should I just quit?
937000	942000	I'm not going to lie to you. I'm like, if Oprah is here, I mean, that's it.
942000	947000	Anyway, okay, so all these jokes aside and things, it is a serious thing.
947000	953000	Again, I think most of you that are tech savvy enough to listen to podcasts probably already have some awareness that this is going on.
953000	958000	But I would urge you to take a look at battleforthenet.com for some more information,
958000	961000	including some actual protests that are going to be happening.
961000	965000	I believe December 7th is the date and they're going to protest actually at some Verizon stores.
965000	969000	And I think that is something that's definitely going to get a lot of attention, a lot of coverage.
969000	974000	But you can't just sit there and do nothing. You have to pick up the phone and make some noise.
974000	979000	Form letters aren't going to do a lot. The FCC literally came out and said,
979000	983000	we disregarded all the comments because they were all form letters. They said that.
983000	985000	But they didn't even...
985000	989000	I know, I know, but it's out there. So don't rely on form letters.
989000	990000	Call.
990000	996000	You have to pick up the phone, call. You have to go out, be seen, be heard. Don't rely on armchair politics.
997000	1002000	Honestly, even if they weren't form letters and they're not, I mean, they're just making excuses.
1002000	1007000	They're by law, they have to do that, but they're just like, fuck it, we don't care.
1007000	1011000	So participate in your government and don't let them do this.
1011000	1016000	And if they do do it, you know, that has to be a reality that we have to face too.
1016000	1021000	If this does go through, you have to hold corporations liable, which to tie this back to gaming,
1021000	1024000	we're seeing happen a lot now with the loot boxes.
1024000	1028000	Again, I don't want to repeat that whole shindig from last week too much,
1028000	1034000	but I think what we've really seen happen is that, you know, EA got hit hard over this Battlefront thing.
1034000	1036000	And that's kind of why they scaled back.
1036000	1041000	And we have some stories coming up on tonight's show where other companies are now starting to,
1041000	1045000	oh shit, we better dial this back before we're the next Twitter target.
1045000	1049000	I only think it's necessary before the next Twitter target is that they see,
1049000	1053000	oh shit, countries are starting to look at this as like,
1053000	1058000	we better investigate this formally to see if this is gambling and whether we're going to classify it as gambling.
1058000	1063000	And they're seeing that their whole source of revenue is going to be just yanked from undering them.
1063000	1066000	And if there's one thing we've seen in this gaming industry,
1066000	1071000	any time the government threatens to regulate it, they go, oh shit, and regulate itself.
1071000	1074000	Hence why we have an ESRB in the first place.
1074000	1077000	So anyway, we'll come back to that point in a minute.
1077000	1082000	But first, on a not so serious topic, let's change to something that is happy news.
1082000	1087000	I think for everybody. And that is, you know, we've had some game releases these past couple of weeks.
1087000	1090000	A lot of the big end of the year titles are starting to come out.
1090000	1094000	But one of them that I know many of you have been looking forward to, you Nintendo nerds,
1094000	1099000	I'm looking at you, is Animal Crossing for mobile devices.
1099000	1102000	Animal Crossing, I forget the subtitle all of a sudden, Pocket Camper.
1102000	1105000	Is that the name of it? Animal Crossing Pocket Camper.
1105000	1106000	Some Pocket Camp.
1106000	1109000	Pocket Camp finally came out on mobile devices this week.
1109000	1111000	Jamie, you've been playing a lot of this.
1111000	1114000	In fact, I see you tapping your phone.
1114000	1116000	You're probably playing it right now.
1116000	1118000	So what are your thoughts on Animal Crossing?
1118000	1119000	It's cute. I really like it.
1119000	1124000	You know, I don't think it could have been much better done than this.
1124000	1126000	I mean, given the limitations.
1126000	1129000	So, yeah, I really like it.
1129000	1131000	This lamp is in the wrong place.
1131000	1135000	I mean, seriously, I've been playing it like I played, you know, old school Animal Crossing.
1135000	1139000	So it can't be, you know, too bad.
1139000	1142000	I've been really happy with it. So.
1142000	1144000	I think it's OK.
1144000	1146000	Well, I didn't ask.
1146000	1149000	I'm a gamer and I'm going to share my opinion anyway.
1149000	1151000	Here's the thing.
1151000	1153000	Well, the price is right. It's free.
1153000	1156000	So you can't go wrong with free.
1156000	1159000	I would not buy leave tickets, but that's a personal decision.
1159000	1161000	That's fine. That's a personal decision.
1161000	1164000	I have spent money on Pokemon Go and people have judged me for that.
1164000	1167000	So that's plenty fine. You spend money on what you like.
1167000	1170000	But I would not spend money on this yourself, at least.
1170000	1174000	Well, that's what I say today. Who knows what patches might come into the game at a later date.
1174000	1178000	Right. So I like it in the fact that it looks really nice.
1178000	1183000	I know that sounds really silly, but like on you know, I have the new iPhone 10 and has that newer screen.
1183000	1192000	And I'm like, wow, the textures on this like they're really like HD and it really kind of pops like, you know, for old school cartoony style, it really does pop.
1192000	1194000	So like graphically, it's good.
1194000	1201000	And I like the way that some of the things translate into the touchscreens, like the fishing and the bug catching is so much easier. Right.
1201000	1208000	But I kind of don't like how it feels like it's scenes from an Animal Crossing game.
1208000	1214000	Like it's like you could go see Les Miserables on Broadway.
1214000	1216000	That's playing a real Animal Crossing game.
1216000	1223000	Or you could listen to the soundtrack that just has like I Dreamed a Dream and the nine other big songs, but kind of skips the rest of it.
1223000	1226000	And you can kind of skip around and listen to your favorite songs.
1226000	1229000	You can have that. And that's kind of what Animal Crossing Pocket Camp is to me.
1229000	1234000	It's like you have these like greatest scenes, but they kind of string together in a really weird way.
1234000	1242000	Like I, I like the questing system, but I don't really care for how repetitive it feels.
1242000	1246000	Like I feel there is nothing to do for these little fuckers.
1246000	1255000	Then get fruit, catch fish, catch bugs, which to be fair was kind of all that the regular Animal Crossing game was as well.
1255000	1261000	But I do feel like at least there was more variety in where you could find items, how you procured things.
1261000	1265000	You could kind of make your custom clothes. There just seemed like there was more that you could do.
1265000	1267000	Is there like more like can you do the custom stuff in this?
1267000	1272000	No, at least not that I've seen yet. I haven't seen the mailbox or any of that stuff yet.
1272000	1277000	So like I said, it's greatest hits. Some of the stuff is kind of cut, but then you have some other stuff that's kind of like interesting.
1277000	1280000	See, that's the problem that I have. I've always had Animal Crossing.
1280000	1284000	It's like you take the first one, which is just like this amazing thing.
1284000	1285000	Right.
1285000	1288000	They had like the NES games and all that cool stuff in there and all the custom stuff.
1288000	1293000	And then each iteration that came out afterwards, it's like we're removing more things from it.
1293000	1297000	And then we're getting down to this, which this is free.
1297000	1299000	So I guess I can't complain.
1299000	1303000	Yeah, you're in this weird place where it's like, but it's free. And that's kind of what I come back to as well.
1303000	1306000	It's like, well, well, but it's free. So it's not a horrible thing.
1306000	1309000	But here's my thing. Here's my number one thing. Let me just get this out.
1309000	1314000	My number one thing is, and you know, for the people that love this game, I think even you could agree with me on this.
1314000	1319000	I would not want this to replace Animal Crossing on consoles.
1319000	1322000	And I have a fear it might.
1322000	1326000	Like everybody's like, when are they going to announce Animal Crossing for the Switch?
1326000	1328000	When are they going to announce Animal Crossing for the Switch?
1328000	1330000	The Pikmin games are going to put out first.
1330000	1334000	Here's my thing, guys. Has Nintendo said they're going to make Animal Crossing for the Switch?
1334000	1340000	I don't believe they have. And if they keep selling leaf tickets on this thing, do they have motivation to make one?
1340000	1344000	Are people buying leaf tickets on this thing? I mean, Jamie did.
1344000	1348000	I know other people. I'm not just going to pick on her. I know plenty of people who have.
1348000	1351000	Some of my other mobile gaming buddies have fessed up to doing it too.
1351000	1353000	So, you know.
1353000	1356000	I did get into the quarry and I did it to buy more storage space.
1356000	1361000	And it does, I will admit, I have been enticed because you can craft more than one thing at one time.
1361000	1363000	If you spend those tickets.
1363000	1365000	I have the three crafting things too.
1365000	1372000	So there are things to do. But again, I can't sit here and be like, oh, Jamie, you're so dumb for buying leaf tickets.
1372000	1376000	And then I sit here and spend money to get a hundred Pokeballs and Pokemon Go.
1376000	1379000	Like I just, I can't, I don't have the fucking conscience to do that. I can't do it.
1379000	1382000	So like she buys the things she likes. I buy the things I like.
1382000	1388000	Right. And I'm not saying it's terrible. I'm just, you know, it's fine. This is a free mobile game.
1388000	1393000	So you're just wondering if that's really the position Nintendo is going to be in.
1393000	1396000	People really are, because the people are spending a ton of money on this.
1396000	1404000	But then, yeah, I could see that this would be more profitable for them because they're making money constantly.
1404000	1411000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I am sad that Super Mario Run canceled all Mario console games.
1411000	1420000	Well, I actually, you say that tongue in cheek, but my understanding is Nintendo believes that game to have underperformed.
1420000	1423000	So it wouldn't cancel Mario games anyway.
1423000	1431000	And at the same time, Mario's in this weird universe where like multiple Mario games exist simultaneously on the same console.
1431000	1439000	What I mean by that is you had Mario 3D World and Mario Maker, both like full fleshed games on the Wii U.
1439000	1445000	And Super Mario Run is a unique niche. It's a weird, the whole like nonstop running thing.
1445000	1449000	It's a weird niche and one I didn't particularly care for ultimately.
1449000	1460000	But I think Nintendo like really purposefully wanted to not make a new Super Mario Brothers Wii type of Mario game or new Super Mario Brothers 3DS, whatever.
1460000	1467000	They didn't want to make that game on mobiles. They wanted, they actually did something to make this very different.
1467000	1477000	But Animal Crossing, it doesn't feel that different. It just feels skipped around. Like I said, like a greatest hits album.
1477000	1483000	That's the only thing. I think greatest hits albums are good. I like to listen to Abba Gold.
1483000	1485000	Unless they edit them like that Samantha Fox album.
1485000	1493000	I like to listen to Abba Gold sometimes. But you know, sometimes I need that deep cut. Sometimes I need to hear Happy New Year.
1493000	1499000	Okay, and that was non-Abba Gold. So sometimes you have to get the deep cuts. Anyway.
1499000	1507000	SSG100Matt points out, there is a KK Slider doing I Dreamed a Dream. Of course there is. Of course there is.
1507000	1513000	And then Act F points out, I know Pokemon won't be released ever again. Only Pokemon Go.
1513000	1518000	Act F says Nintendo is doing this to promote their games. It's not to replace the original.
1518000	1522000	Well I hope you're right because I do think the Switch would be a great platform for Animal Crossing.
1522000	1531000	But I don't want it to be the same Animal Crossing rehashed again. I do hope they really try to.
1531000	1539000	I mean if this Animal Crossing Pocket Camper is kind of like the love letter to the old school Animal Crossing games.
1539000	1543000	Then great. Fine. It's a greatest hits album. It's a nice little send off.
1543000	1547000	But I would really like to see Animal Crossing on the Switch kind of bring some new features.
1547000	1553000	And I'm not talking about like a mall. Like I would like to see them do more with the online.
1553000	1558000	I would love to see the arcade games come back. I know it's never going to be the NES games.
1558000	1563000	But it's not like Nintendo doesn't know how to make mini games. You know, they could make unique to Animal Crossing games.
1563000	1568000	I would like to see more of the exploration stuff. Like how you used to be able to go to the island.
1568000	1573000	I think it would be really cool if there were other ways you could visit other types of atmospheres.
1573000	1579000	Maybe more traveling and maybe that could be the theme of the next Animal Crossing game is that you travel around the world or something.
1579000	1583000	And maybe something where there's like different cultures and different towns and things like that.
1583000	1588000	But the tongue in cheek thing is that the cultures wouldn't necessarily have to reflect the cultures IRL.
1588000	1596000	You could go to like the penguin land and you could go to where all those bitch sheep live and so forth.
1596000	1601000	Bitch sheep land. And you could you could all the sheep are bitches. You could bury all the.
1601000	1606000	Have you met Barbara? She's a bitch. You could bury Ed up to his neck.
1606000	1611000	And I don't know how the horned dynastids poke him.
1611000	1617000	They just need to send Barbara into the upside down to be eaten by a Demogorgon.
1617000	1622000	You know what? Why not put the upside down in Animal Crossing? Maybe something kind of neat could happen.
1622000	1627000	I would like a sick twist like that. Animal Crossing survival horror. I'm down.
1627000	1633000	Come on, dark soccer. See now the thing, the pitfalls. Now they have a purpose because they send you to the upside down to survival horror.
1633000	1640000	And remember the dream village and there was the murder mystery dream village like called Aika town.
1640000	1647000	No, I don't. Oh, oh, yeah. Remember? Yes. Yes. And you'd find like the broken dolls and like the weird story it would tell.
1647000	1652000	Yes. I still have a save for Aika village. It was pretty crazy.
1652000	1657000	As long as Barbara is the first to die. She's going to be she's going to be the new. I almost said a spoiler. I can't say it.
1657000	1663000	All right. Some people still haven't watched Stranger Things. Cat butt scrooches.
1663000	1669000	Anyway, Robert M in chat says, since the mobile game autosaves is Mr. Resetti involved.
1669000	1672000	Now, I don't believe he's in this mobile game at all.
1672000	1677000	So that's that's one of those B sides that got overlooked on the greatest hits album is Mr. Resetti.
1677000	1682000	But who knows? They might they might patch stuff in. Who knows? You know, again, I don't hate Animal Crossing.
1682000	1687000	It's free. I just I'm not motivated to spend money, but she is.
1687000	1692000	So maybe Nintendo is doing something right. And I'm sure it's more of you out there spending money on it, too.
1692000	1699000	So there you go. Animal Crossing. Oh, I want to check our discord as well, because I know I like to post little plugs in our discord.
1699000	1703000	And if you want to join our discord server, I highly recommend you do.
1703000	1708000	Just go to vognetwork.com slash discord and you can join the discord for the voice geeks network.
1708000	1713000	vognetwork.com. Again, that's vognetwork.com slash discord.
1713000	1717000	JD in chat says, I'm mostly enjoying Animal Crossing Pocket Camp.
1717000	1721000	It definitely has that freemium flavor, but I haven't felt pressured to buy anything.
1721000	1725000	I've kind of settled into a play 30 minutes every three hours routine.
1725000	1729000	That's from JD on Discord. Dartitsuya says, I only play a little bit of it.
1729000	1732000	I just have to figure out where to get the friend code stuff started.
1732000	1736000	Oh, and actually JD kind of answers this, too, but I'll answer it here.
1736000	1742000	You I mean, I see people posting their screen caps of friend codes everywhere, and that's great.
1742000	1746000	But just just link it to Facebook and Twitter if you have them.
1746000	1752000	And that's how I found everybody. Just go to Facebook on Twitter and then just add everybody that way.
1752000	1755000	So it does have those links in there. You don't even ever need the friend code.
1755000	1761000	And then I found people that I had no idea played these games that were playing it thanks to Facebook.
1761000	1770000	The one little thing I wish it would do is that it never tells you again who the person is after the first time you add them.
1770000	1776000	Like I'll be able to see like Jamie Summers on Facebook is here as Sakura.
1776000	1781000	You know, I'll be able to see that. But if I forget that she's Sakura, like I'll never remember that that was Jamie's character.
1781000	1784000	If it doesn't like because never tells you after you initially add them.
1784000	1788000	That's the one kind of bummer thing that I hope they hope they fix.
1788000	1792000	But I believe that was the case in Nami Tomo and all that stuff, too.
1792000	1796000	So JD points out if someone else adds you, it doesn't tell you who they are.
1796000	1800000	No, it doesn't, does it? No, it's only when you add them that you know who they are.
1800000	1802000	So there are there are some imperfections there.
1802000	1807000	But Nintendo online, I don't expect them to ever get that right.
1807000	1810000	JD says, I got a friend request from pumpkin.
1810000	1814000	And I don't know if it's someone I know or some rando who encountered me in their game.
1814000	1819000	It's not me. I know I'm a prime suspect with all things pumpkin, but it's not me.
1819000	1822000	I'll give you that. Anyhow.
1822000	1826000	All right. Let's move on. We got other gaming things we want to talk about tonight.
1826000	1832000	Let's first, though, get into our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.
1832000	1834000	Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
1835000	1841000	I played Dragon Age Inquisition. I played Mass Effect Andromeda for a little bit.
1841000	1844000	I cannot stop looking at this cat.
1844000	1846000	Mr. Smoosh is going to ruin this show.
1846000	1848000	Smooshles. Smooshles.
1848000	1852000	And I say that because we always get distracted by Mr. Smoosh.
1852000	1857000	Mr. Smoosh may be the biggest case yet for the show going to video,
1857000	1860000	because I always said, like, I don't know if it would be fun to put us on cam,
1860000	1863000	but we could put Mr. Smoosh on cam and then everybody would watch.
1863000	1865000	Yep. Cat cam.
1865000	1866000	Yeah.
1866000	1868000	We call it the smoosh cam.
1868000	1873000	But I've been playing some Itomo. I'm playing idle pouring.
1873000	1876000	I think I'm on my third rebirth now. Third or fourth. I don't know.
1876000	1879000	I don't even know what that means. I kind of stopped. Sorry.
1879000	1882000	After, like, you played it once.
1882000	1884000	I played it once a week.
1884000	1885000	Once.
1885000	1887000	Once across a week and then I was done.
1887000	1888000	Whatever.
1888000	1894000	And, of course, I'm playing Pokemon Go and Animal Crossing.
1894000	1898000	Click, click, click, click, click, click. Animal Crossing.
1898000	1901000	No Ed. Thank God. No Ed.
1901000	1904000	We got Super Mario Galaxy.
1904000	1908000	And so Dan's been mostly playing it. I have played some.
1908000	1910000	We broke out four player arms.
1910000	1913000	Wait, wait, wait. Mario Galaxy on the Wii?
1913000	1914000	Odyssey. Sorry.
1914000	1916000	Oh, Odyssey. It's hard to keep them all straight.
1916000	1918000	Whatever. It's Mario something or the other.
1918000	1919000	Yeah.
1919000	1921000	With the giant. Okay. So I have to bring this up.
1921000	1924000	You know how, like, your hat guy lives in hat town?
1924000	1925000	Mm hmm.
1925000	1929000	It made me remember the series that was on Pinwheel.
1929000	1931000	Do you remember Pinwheel?
1931000	1933000	Like that used to come out like 6 a.m. on Nickelodeon?
1933000	1934000	Right.
1934000	1935000	Hell yeah.
1935000	1937000	Pinwheel. Pinwheel. Spin me around.
1937000	1943000	And one of the little British shows that it showed in there was the Hat Village. Remember that?
1943000	1944000	Kind of.
1944000	1948000	When I went and looked it up, it was fucking called the, like, Hattytown Adventures.
1948000	1954000	And the main hat was a sombrero named Sancho.
1954000	1956000	This is like from 1979 or something.
1956000	1961000	My brain, like, kind of combined Pinwheel and Today's Special. I keep thinking they're the same show.
1961000	1963000	Today's Special was fun.
1963000	1965000	Wasn't Today's Special Canadian?
1965000	1967000	It was. It was a set in a department store.
1967000	1969000	Everything on Nickelodeon in the early 80s was Canadian.
1969000	1971000	And the lady was a mannequin.
1971000	1972000	Everything.
1972000	1973000	The lady was a mannequin. Remember?
1973000	1974000	Yes.
1974000	1976000	Anyway. And the puppet security guard.
1976000	1981000	Yes. I'm really going to be intimidated by a damn puppet with some fucking pasta mustache.
1981000	1982000	Whatever.
1982000	1987000	Well, anyway, but it's just that whole game gave me flashbacks to Hattytown Village.
1987000	1990000	Or Hattytown Avengers or whatever the fuck it was called.
1990000	1994000	So, especially the Bobby hat. That's what it made me think of.
1994000	1999000	Because the constable in the town was called Bobby and he was a constable hat.
1999000	2000000	Anyway.
2000000	2004000	There's like two listeners. Everybody else is way too fucking young to understand.
2004000	2008000	You children. I had younger siblings and I was forced to watch this shit.
2008000	2012000	Let us 40-somethings have our moment. Or nearly 40-somethings.
2012000	2014000	I got the cat's tail. He doesn't care.
2014000	2016000	And so.
2016000	2018000	Because you're helping him lick his ass.
2018000	2021000	There you go. There you go. Lick. Lick. Lick. Lick. Lick.
2021000	2023000	I do that to Midna too.
2023000	2030000	But we also broke out both of our Joy-Con sets and played ARMS 4 player.
2030000	2032000	Which was really kind of cool.
2032000	2037000	And that's kind of it.
2037000	2038000	Hattytown.
2038000	2039000	Alright.
2039000	2041000	Just say Hattytown three times fast.
2041000	2043000	Hattytown. Hattytown. Hattytown.
2043000	2044000	It's kind of funny.
2044000	2046000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
2047000	2051000	Well I played League of Marvel Superheroes 2.
2051000	2055000	More of that because I'm just trying to unlock all the characters for my kids.
2055000	2056000	And.
2056000	2059000	Let's see what else.
2059000	2063000	I bought South Park but I haven't played it yet.
2063000	2065000	I really. Like I bought it on Playstation 4.
2065000	2069000	And since my wife hogs the TV I really should have tried it on.
2069000	2071000	I should have gotten it on PC.
2071000	2073000	In hindsight.
2073000	2076000	But you know I figured I had pre-ordered it originally on Playstation 4.
2076000	2080000	And I got the free copy of South Park The Stick of Truth.
2080000	2082000	So I was like I'll just do it again on there.
2082000	2084000	But I tried to do the whole.
2084000	2086000	Like I haven't.
2086000	2091000	I was doing the Playstation streaming on my old laptop.
2091000	2093000	Which is pretty old.
2093000	2096000	And my new laptop I'm like well shit this should do it way better.
2096000	2098000	Oh my fucking god.
2098000	2100000	Their app is a piece of shit.
2100000	2104000	Like first off apparently there's this issue where there's.
2104000	2107000	Okay so you start off you load in everything.
2107000	2109000	You sign up your account or whatever.
2109000	2111000	So I did all that.
2111000	2114000	And so I had to factor out the first before the two factor authentication.
2114000	2116000	They want me to do a reCAPTCHA.
2116000	2120000	And it's like okay click on all the pictures that are a car.
2120000	2123000	And keep clicking on them until there are no more cars.
2123000	2125000	I will tell you this much.
2125000	2129000	I was clicking on that fucking picture for 30 fucking minutes.
2129000	2132000	Because every time the last square had a car picture in it.
2132000	2135000	I click on it and another fucking car picture did.
2135000	2139000	And it kept doing that over and fucking over again.
2139000	2141000	Until it finally let me in.
2141000	2146000	And then after all that then it wanted to do two factor authentication on my fucking phone.
2146000	2150000	And after all that then it didn't fucking work very well.
2150000	2152000	It's like laggy as shit.
2152000	2156000	So fuck you Sony your stuff sucks.
2156000	2165000	And apparently this is an issue that anybody that uses the PC app for PlayStation streaming or whatever.
2165000	2169000	It's been going on for over a year now.
2169000	2171000	That they haven't just fixed this shit.
2171000	2173000	It's just been fucking broken for a while now.
2173000	2175000	So.
2175000	2177000	I missed the CAPTCHA we had at VOG.
2177000	2179000	The whole like play a mini game.
2179000	2181000	That thing was awesome.
2181000	2183000	The company shut down.
2183000	2185000	We didn't want to get rid of it.
2185000	2189000	We didn't have a problem doing a CAPTCHA because most of the time it's like 5-10 seconds at the most.
2189000	2191000	It's just like click on the picture.
2191000	2192000	Okay done.
2192000	2194000	And this shit was just it was broken.
2194000	2200000	Like you could tell like there'd be stuff like and it was like it's all of them were cars or street signs or pictures of streets.
2200000	2202000	It's like okay well here's a picture of a street sign.
2202000	2204000	Is that still counted as a street?
2204000	2206000	Because I know it's a picture of a street.
2206000	2208000	But you're showing me just the street sign.
2208000	2210000	Is that line in the background?
2210000	2212000	Is that a street?
2212000	2214000	And so it was just all fucked up.
2214000	2218000	And finally I got it to work after 30 minutes wasting the whole night doing this shit.
2218000	2221000	And they come to find out it's laggy as fuck.
2221000	2225000	I'm just like my internet is fucking great.
2225000	2227000	My network is great.
2227000	2230000	My wife at the time because it took so long wasn't on Netflix.
2230000	2236000	So there is no reason with gigabit ethernet that I shouldn't be able to stream this shit.
2236000	2238000	Yet for some reason, nope.
2238000	2240000	Not gonna fucking happen.
2240000	2242000	I just don't know.
2242000	2245000	So that wasn't a thing.
2245000	2251000	So yeah I didn't get to really play a whole ton of stuff other than Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2.
2251000	2256000	I did end up playing more of the stupid cell phone games.
2256000	2262000	Ironically enough not any Animal Crossing because honestly I was bored of that game after 5 minutes.
2262000	2265000	Like I played it and I'm like okay this is what this game is gonna be.
2265000	2267000	I can't see myself doing this.
2267000	2272000	I can't see myself just going and gathering stuff to make furniture that I don't give a shit about.
2272000	2274000	I can't play this anymore.
2274000	2276000	And so that's kind of where that was.
2276000	2280000	But yet I'll play this stupid fucking office space clicker game that gets fucking worse.
2280000	2282000	Everybody has their weakness.
2282000	2283000	All the time.
2283000	2290000	It just gets fucking more and more complicated and just like watch more ads bullshit.
2290000	2293000	But it's like oh give me more of that.
2293000	2295000	I can't stop playing that.
2296000	2301000	And no VR games because once again I just was too lazy to set it up.
2301000	2303000	If I'm going to I want to.
2303000	2310000	It's like the other day I was like should I play Lego Marvel Super Heroes or all these VR games I haven't.
2310000	2312000	I don't know which VR game I want to play.
2312000	2314000	I'm just gonna go play Lego Marvel Super Heroes.
2314000	2316000	That's how I did it.
2316000	2317000	That's it.
2317000	2318000	Alright.
2318000	2320000	My gaming week.
2320000	2326000	Honestly not a whole lot besides my usual cell phone stuff with with Ingress and Pokemon Go.
2326000	2331000	Which both of those games are having double experience events going on right now.
2331000	2335000	And I actually find I'm kind of grinding Pokemon Go a little harder than Ingress.
2335000	2339000	But Pokemon Go is nice because the Pokemon are kind of everywhere.
2339000	2341000	Whereas Ingress you have to you know go to specific places.
2341000	2345000	So Pokemon you can kind of open the app and play at home for a little bit.
2345000	2347000	I try to do both.
2347000	2351000	Obviously I try to do both and you know I will go out on walks and things.
2351000	2356000	And there's you know places near where I work where there's both portals and Pokestops.
2356000	2360000	And I will use my little you know Bluetooth device to play both games at the same time.
2360000	2365000	Now that I have the iPhone 10 I have much better luck playing two games at the same time that way.
2365000	2367000	So it does allow me to do that.
2367000	2372000	But I haven't been particularly motivated to like because I'm in that stage in Ingress where I'm level 15 but not 16.
2372000	2374000	And like 16 is as high as you can go.
2374000	2376000	It's like the highest you can possibly go.
2376000	2379000	It's not like okay I hit level 16 then what.
2379000	2385000	Like once you hit level what is it now 10 and you can submit your own portals and rate the other portals.
2385000	2387000	Maybe that's 12 I don't remember.
2387000	2391000	Well yeah they did the rate thing that was a while ago then they just added where you can submit stuff now.
2391000	2395000	Yeah once you hit that point it's like well I can do everything I need to do.
2395000	2400000	So the rest of it is just but I mean not to say like you know I still have fun playing the game.
2400000	2407000	And once in a while you know I'll need that Zen moment of leaving the house and making fields in the neighborhood.
2407000	2415000	Do the batches that you get from the yearly things do those count towards your badge counts on Ingress for levels and stuff.
2415000	2416000	Yes.
2416000	2418000	Sweet I'm going to get the level up.
2418000	2422000	Oh why because you're getting a gold badge and it's like the one thing holding you back.
2422000	2423000	Platinum or something.
2423000	2424000	Nice. Yeah yeah.
2424000	2425000	Oh that's funny.
2425000	2427000	Alright I'll be 13.
2427000	2428000	Congrats.
2428000	2430000	Alright but then Pokemon.
2430000	2434000	Then Pokemon has the new thing which I know we'll talk about later in the show quickly.
2434000	2438000	But you know I yeah that game's still fun and I'm grinding that.
2438000	2443000	Actually I will say this because I'm what I'm level 35 I think in Pokemon Go.
2443000	2451000	So what I want to do is I do want to hit both level 16 in Ingress and level 40 in Pokemon Go.
2451000	2456000	And then I should get some type of certificate for that for like sickest individual alive right.
2456000	2461000	Wouldn't I get some type of acknowledgement for like like you have an AR disease.
2461000	2462000	Congratulations.
2462000	2463000	Like maybe that'll be a thing.
2463000	2465000	So there you go.
2465000	2468000	But I have been playing at home.
2468000	2471000	I've still been playing Heroes of the Storm which I play.
2471000	2475000	I try to do my daily gold matches every day to get my daily gold.
2475000	2477000	I finally threw him money.
2477000	2485000	I finally gave them money just because I've been playing the game so much and I fucking wanted Junkrat.
2485000	2488000	So I bought him with real money.
2488000	2490000	So there I got suckered into it.
2490000	2495000	But it was a free game and it's I've played it for many many hours so I don't feel that bad doing it.
2495000	2499000	And then another game of course I got suckered back into playing I think I talked about this last week.
2499000	2504000	I started playing World of Warcraft and actually I've been playing it like a lot.
2504000	2507000	Are you on the regular server.
2507000	2514000	No I am no I went I went somewhere and I rolled just to be somewhere like I'm not playing with anybody.
2514000	2518000	So because I'll be honest I actually might be re upping.
2518000	2519000	Oh there you go.
2519000	2531000	It's I don't know like I've been playing and there's there's things I like and I really like what I'm hearing about this next patch they're going to do which is where it's not going to like all the questing is going to scale.
2531000	2538000	Like that was the best part of the expansion is how the quest in the new zones scaled you remember that and like so it didn't matter which zone you did you just go did what you want.
2538000	2541000	They're doing that for all the zones.
2541000	2542000	So like.
2542000	2543000	That'll be great.
2543000	2548000	You can it's you level 0 to 60 in any classic wow zone.
2548000	2553000	If you want to go straight to fucking swamp of sorrows and start your new character you can do that.
2553000	2558000	You you're going to have the level scaling and then I think it's 60 to 80.
2558000	2565000	You can do either Northrend or the Burning Crusade content.
2565000	2567000	No good nor Northrend that's amazing.
2567000	2569000	Yeah you could skip one or the other altogether.
2569000	2573000	For me I really like the music in Northrend so I'd rather just music but I hate the questing.
2573000	2578000	Yeah so except for the Zandalari and then I think they're combining cataclysm and pandaria.
2578000	2581000	I think will be eight which is great because cataclysm fucking blows.
2581000	2582000	Sorry.
2582000	2585000	So well panda isn't much better but those quests are better so I would do those.
2585000	2586000	And then yes.
2586000	2590000	And then you have the normal world trainer and stuff so I think that's really cool what they're doing.
2590000	2592000	But don't get me wrong.
2592000	2595000	I'm still a big big fan of Final Fantasy 14.
2595000	2599000	It's just somehow I've now been suckered into paying for two MMOs.
2599000	2604000	I bought one month of WoW and I thought maybe I could make enough gold to pay for another month.
2604000	2605000	We'll see.
2605000	2611000	But playing WoW does make me realize oh these are the things that I kind of like better in Final Fantasy 14.
2611000	2614000	Like I actually think I like running dungeons better in 14.
2614000	2621000	But then when I play WoW I'm also like but these are the it seems like there's kind of more to do in endgame in WoW than there is in Final Fantasy 14.
2621000	2624000	That was the thing that let me lead 14.
2624000	2628000	There was just not there was jack shit to do once you were done with the main stuff.
2628000	2633000	They saw that they added the ability to play songs as a bard now.
2633000	2635000	Yeah that was something they added in 14.
2635000	2640000	I haven't really played around with that yet but yeah the whole perform thing where you can like make your own songs.
2640000	2641000	That's kind of neat.
2641000	2646000	But you know Final Fantasy 14 kind of needs just a few more things like that and it'll it'll be.
2646000	2650000	Well I and I will say I think I but this is personal opinion.
2650000	2653000	I think the story in 14 is still superior.
2653000	2659000	Like I think the Heavensward and especially Stormblood like those stories are so fucking good.
2659000	2665000	Like they're better than just about almost any other game in the Final Fantasy like franchise.
2665000	2666000	It's that good.
2666000	2670000	So it definitely beats WoW but that's a personal thing.
2670000	2677000	I also know some people that are super gung ho about Blizzard that love the story in World of Warcraft and can't really get into Final Fantasy the same way.
2677000	2682000	And it just goes back to money for Leaf tickets or money for Pokeballs.
2682000	2685000	What is what is your preference you know whatever you want to do.
2685000	2687000	So anyway that's that's our business.
2687000	2691000	I'm up to level 67 on my resto druid.
2691000	2696000	I just started what like a week and a half ago is whenever I got back from Seattle about a week and a half ago.
2696000	2699000	So I'm making pretty good progress I think.
2700000	2703000	SSJ100Matt in chat says time to bring out.
2703000	2704000	Excuse me.
2704000	2708000	SSJ100Matt in chat says time to bring back courthouse.
2708000	2711000	That's funny.
2711000	2714000	As far as the other thing goes I'm loving these names for the certificates.
2714000	2718000	JD in chat suggests you've kept Niantic afloat.
2718000	2721000	Actf says Niantic still exists because of people like you badge.
2721000	2726000	I forgot to mention there is a huge Ingress event in San Francisco on Saturday.
2726000	2735000	So that's like another thing. So I'm I'm actually legit concerned I might be late to next week's show because of said event.
2735000	2738000	So if the show doesn't start at six I apologize.
2741000	2745000	Or Jamie will just have to figure out what button she's got to push to make it start.
2745000	2747000	But Alan will be here to let you guys in.
2747000	2751000	So no I'm really I'm not thinking that will actually happen but it might.
2751000	2753000	So we'll see.
2754000	2756000	Anyway there we go.
2756000	2759000	Let's get into some other housekeeping.
2761000	2767000	We're still going to be here for the next few weeks but Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve are both on Sundays.
2767000	2774000	So I highly doubt we're going to have live shows either of those nights because I'm pretty sure I have to do my family stuff on Christmas Eve.
2774000	2779000	And Jamie I know even though you're Jewish dance family you celebrate with them Christmas Eve right?
2779000	2780000	Kinda.
2780000	2781000	Yeah so.
2781000	2785000	We usually just do Christmas Eve stuff and then Christmas Day stuff if I'm not working.
2785000	2786000	Yeah.
2786000	2787000	And I think I'm working.
2787000	2788000	So we're probably.
2788000	2790000	Actually no.
2790000	2792000	I may be on leave.
2792000	2794000	Oh right right. Yeah yeah yeah.
2794000	2795000	Yeah.
2795000	2797000	Well regardless. Oh yeah.
2797000	2804000	And by the way we're not going to say too much about it but Jamie's going to be absent from the show for a couple of weeks due to some other stuff.
2804000	2809000	So we're talking about like I think doing maybe an early show on like New Year's.
2809000	2810000	Maybe New Year's Eve.
2810000	2814000	A lot of that's going to depend on on her and her schedule.
2814000	2816000	OK so we'll let you know.
2816000	2818000	Right Jamie.
2818000	2824000	Well and if if anyone who I trust well enough wants to ask me what's going on I'll probably tell you.
2824000	2825000	Yeah.
2825000	2826000	But nothing public.
2826000	2827000	It's personal business is all they need.
2827000	2828000	And it's not bad.
2828000	2829000	And it's not bad.
2829000	2830000	It's all they need to know.
2830000	2831000	No.
2831000	2832000	All right.
2832000	2834000	Anyway I think that's it for housekeeping.
2834000	2836000	I'm just having cybernetic parts put in.
2836000	2842000	She literally is going to be the bionic woman now because I am calling her Jamie Summers since you know the beginning of time.
2842000	2844000	So she's getting the implants.
2844000	2845000	Yep.
2845000	2848000	I'm going to get the leg and the arm and the eyes.
2848000	2850000	She's going to get a leg just like Rose McGowan.
2850000	2853000	And what was that movie where the grand house.
2853000	2854000	Yes.
2854000	2855000	Planet Terror.
2855000	2856000	Yes.
2856000	2857000	Planet Terror.
2857000	2859000	You know I actually saw a really.
2859000	2862000	Next time Loki's critical and Nintendo.
2862000	2867000	I really I saw the good Halloween costume of an amputee who did that.
2867000	2868000	Perfect.
2868000	2869000	Perfect.
2869000	2870000	Yeah.
2870000	2871000	All right.
2871000	2875000	Let's get into some gaming news Loki.
2875000	2885000	So as we kind of mentioned when we're talking a little bit about the whole net neutrality and loot boxing certain countries and states have kind of weighed in on the whole loot box stuff.
2885000	2901000	So one of the states actually kind of came out and made a comment about it was of course Chris Lee from Hawaii who actually was making an announcement talking about that loot boxes demonstrate predatory behavior and that they want to combat that.
2901000	2916000	And of course you know they're talking about you know basically saying the EA is being very predatory towards people saying that this is like a Star Wars themed online casino designed to lure kids in the spending money.
2916000	2920000	And it's a trap because that's totally a Star Wars thing to say.
2920000	2922000	You have to say it's a trap as a trap.
2922000	2925000	Thank you Loki.
2925000	2928000	You don't look quite like an encephalopod though.
2928000	2931000	That's a compliment.
2931000	2938000	I look like a homeless person earlier today and I get shaved.
2938000	2939000	But yes.
2939000	2949000	So of course you know they're going to look into that to see what they could do to maybe help you if it comes down to fighting it including blocking a regulation.
2949000	2961000	Along with that other countries have weighed in Belgium was one that actually they had a kind of a translation from an article saying that you know they saw them as demonstrating while it's not exactly gambling.
2961000	2971000	It does demonstrate a lot of the same things that you would see with gambling having that same kind of appeal as people would to like different gambling games.
2971000	2975000	France has come out as well against it saying that.
2975000	2980000	Basically that they're also you know very predatory.
2980000	2991000	One of the things they were talking about was I guess the A.R. J.L. which is a French organization that regulates online gambling.
2991000	3003000	Basically a letter from French Senator Jerome during basically said that you know they wanted them to look into this because you know.
3003000	3014000	Since there has been such an advancement of gaming culture basically talking about you know e-sports and microtransactions the blue boxes seeing whether or not that they.
3015000	3031000	These need to be regulated like online gambling because of you know the way that you know people are spending money on this and see he wants to see you kind of like how China's done were more transparency in the drop rates to help players.
3031000	3035000	You make more informed decisions and.
3035000	3041000	You know also just kind of making sure that they're not doing anything shady kind of like online gambling.
3041000	3050000	Because yeah I mean if they're basically putting this out there in a way that they can kind of skirt around laws because you're buying fake currency to do this.
3050000	3064000	That's it seems like that they shouldn't be able to get away with that because if you think about it like if I have you know if I'm trying to sell drugs which is obviously illegal but I say no no I'm not really selling drugs.
3064000	3072000	I'm selling this picture that I drew on a piece of paper with a pencil and you're just getting the drugs for free with that drawing that I did.
3072000	3079000	You can't do that it's still illegal you know even though I'm saying oh well I'm not selling the drugs I'm just selling this picture.
3079000	3087000	Something similar that it's like oh no no we're not spending real money on it you just buy this fake currency that you then spend on the gambling.
3087000	3089000	It doesn't work that way.
3089000	3100000	You wouldn't be able to buy like you know California crystals to buy California lottery tickets with if you're underage it's it doesn't work that way.
3100000	3102000	So I don't know.
3102000	3109000	I definitely hope they look into this a little more because I'm all for them getting rid of this bullshit.
3109000	3111000	Do you think it's going to come to that regulation.
3111000	3116000	Do you think if the gaming industry has a tendency to kind of back down.
3116000	3123000	And I kind of think like I think this backlash that's happened against D.A. other companies have to be noticing it.
3123000	3127000	Yeah I think that they definitely notice it and it definitely will have an impact on it.
3127000	3132000	But like a lot of the times you know where they say they need this for development you know costs and stuff like that.
3132000	3135000	Look at EA's direct words what they are talking about.
3135000	3141000	They mentioned to their investors about they're saying that this is going to have no financial impact on them.
3141000	3145000	You know the fact that they're you know removing these temporarily.
3145000	3151000	So if it's going to have no financial impact on them then why did they need to be there in the first place.
3151000	3154000	Obviously they make more money so they could do it without it.
3154000	3158000	It's just they want to do it with it because they're going to make more money.
3158000	3162000	I don't know. I think if they keep pushing it keeps moving in this direction.
3162000	3166000	Obviously now they kind of took too much of a leap.
3166000	3175000	But if it keeps if they still try to inch it out even further then yeah there's gonna be more backlash with it including you know now that it's gotten mainstream press and stuff.
3175000	3180000	More regulation you know regulatory bodies looking at this type of stuff.
3180000	3186000	I think it is going to come to the point where they're going to have to be transparent about the percentages of drop rates and these things.
3187000	3195000	How about stop being fucking assholes about it and just if you want to sell DLC sell DLC.
3195000	3197000	That's fine.
3197000	3204000	But the fact that you have a random loot drop that's fine if it's an in-game thing like Borderlands.
3204000	3206000	Random loot drops all day long.
3206000	3213000	But that's in-game that's part of the game it's not this like I have to spend money to buy loot boxes.
3213000	3216000	Which God forbid you know take two.
3216000	3223000	Well probably we'll see that in Borderlands 3 but you know it's it's not necessary.
3223000	3230000	It's definitely no one's going to look at it and go oh they're not trying to make money off this.
3230000	3236000	I mean obviously they're trying to make money off this and the fact that it's random is so that you're not guaranteed to get what you want in it.
3236000	3238000	So that you will spend more money on it.
3238000	3243000	And that's they're not selling a service they're selling just like a lottery which is gambling.
3243000	3246000	Is it weird to hear lawmakers talking about this.
3246000	3247000	Do you think they'll get it right.
3247000	3254000	Because I noticed what's you know something that we kind of have to get used to is that it kind of felt like in the 90s like lawmakers didn't play video games.
3254000	3255000	They were in touch with it.
3255000	3262000	But now you know you know 30 and 40 some things we grew up on video games everybody kind of knows what Nintendo is at this point.
3262000	3263000	I don't think they'll get it right.
3263000	3272000	And unfortunately for them that's going to work against the gaming industry because the way they're going to perceive it because people say that it's like gambling is they're going to call it an online casino.
3272000	3274000	Star Wars themed online casino.
3274000	3275000	And if that happens then it's done.
3275000	3276000	Loot boxes are gone.
3276000	3278000	I mean that's going to happen.
3278000	3280000	They'll be gone from Overwatch too.
3280000	3288000	Which is going to be because you know again Blizzard seems immune from all this because you know to be fair because it's it's cosmetic.
3288000	3298000	You know and I'm sorry if they get caught in the crossfire with it but you know what Activision Blizzard you're not you're not 100 percent innocent.
3298000	3299000	You guys said that.
3299000	3311000	I mean it may not necessarily be as much on the Blizzard side of things but Activision they have their fair share of bullshit that they've been pulling with the loot box stuff so they are equally the blame for this.
3311000	3316000	And I'm sorry if it comes to that we're all loot boxes basically are just gone.
3316000	3319000	Well you know what you kind of have yourself the blame for it.
3319000	3325000	All right I don't want to rehash the loot box thing too much more unless Jamie you want to add something because you were here last week for the big kickoff topic on that.
3325000	3334000	But if you do want to email us of course you can always continue the conversation if you want it's your show participate at orange launcher dot com if you want to send us an email.
3334000	3338000	But I will point this out because this is an interesting kind of other side of things.
3338000	3343000	Now this is a game that was a whole free to play thing that both Loki and I have talked about.
3343000	3350000	God ad nauseum on this show. Yes a little game called Clicker Heroes. Remember when we were all into Clicker Heroes.
3350000	3355000	Well I didn't know that did you know Clicker Heroes to get in a fucking sequel because of course it is.
3355000	3365000	Of course it is right. But here's the interesting thing about it. So with Clicker Heroes to play source has decided you know what we're getting rid of the free to play Ruby mechanic.
3365000	3367000	We're getting rid of it.
3367000	3373000	And if you don't know what the Ruby mechanic is once in a great while a Ruby will drop that you can click.
3373000	3383000	And then you use the rubies to buy premium stuff. But of course if you want to just buy what is it like 10 rubies for ninety nine cents or whatever it is I don't know the exact ratio you can do that.
3383000	3390000	And that's with the PC version the PlayStation version all the version which makes sense because of the free free game right. It was a free to play game to be fair.
3390000	3400000	What is Mr. Smoosh. What do you do. Oh God. Hold on guys. Mr. Smoosh has one of my free chisel toys from. Yeah. Remember chisel is for the cat.
3400000	3407000	I know things are for the cat. I know but I don't want him to destroy that. That's like a keepsake at this point. OK Mr. Smoosh don't tear that up. OK OK.
3407000	3413000	Shall I just go into my story. Not yet.
3413000	3423000	All right. So yeah. So basically instead of going the whole free to play route they're actually going to be you know charging money up front and not having all of that free to play stuff.
3423000	3433000	So they're going to actually charge thirty dollars for the sequel which that's interesting. I'd be curious to see how the game plays.
3433000	3440000	Yeah. I'm looking at the screenshots and it looks like they tried to take a little more like it looks a little more Diablo esque in the way at least that it looks.
3440000	3456000	But I can't see how the main game mechanics are going to change that much. So we'll see. But what's also interesting about it is they basically said the developer PlaySource kind of says you know we've made a lot of money off of what they call the whales which are you know the free to play mechanics.
3456000	3466000	But they said we don't want this kind of money if it came from anyone who regrets their decision if it made their lives significantly worse as a result.
3466000	3474000	We really don't like making money off players who are in denial of their addiction. And that's what a large part of free to play gaming is all about.
3474000	3482000	Everyone in the industry seems to rationalize it by shifting the blame assuming way too much cognizance on the part of their victims.
3482000	3489000	So isn't that interesting that they're coming out and basically saying people are addicted to this shit and we don't want to enable it anymore.
3489000	3499000	I can see that. I mean it the clicker games are quite addicting. I I've never been compelled to buy currency though in it. So there's that.
3499000	3509000	But you know I'm willing to pay for their game if it's if it's decent. I can't really tell based on the screenshots but it's fun for a while.
3509000	3516000	I don't know. I mean I I spent ten dollars on the rubies at one point but that was more of a it wasn't that I needed to do it.
3516000	3524000	That was more of a and that's all I ever spent was ten bucks. It was more of a I wanted to pay something to the developers for like all the hours I spent playing the game.
3524000	3532000	I was kind of like you know they deserve a little kickback and sure getting the double gems power up or whatever the fuck I bought right away.
3532000	3543000	That's a nice little kick too. But that's it. Like I'm only ever going to spend ten dollars on this whereas like seriously don't ask me how much I've spent on Pokemon Go or how much gas I've put in my car because of Ingress like just don't don't ask.
3543000	3558000	I won't tell you. Yeah I mean it's fine. I don't have a problem supporting developers like this and it's good to see that these people even like someone that like it would be very easy for them to just you know keep the same thing and they could defend it with saying listen it's a free play game.
3559000	3569000	Yeah I mean it's kind of hard to argue that but the fact that they're saying listen now we don't want to kind of we've kind of thought about it and we don't want to be a part of this problem.
3569000	3580000	You know that that's might I guess that's pretty noble of them I guess but I think that maybe they've determined like that the average amount people spent was 30 bucks and probably they probably could make more money.
3580000	3596000	Well I just I worry for them because well maybe maybe not. I mean if the average was 30 bucks and they sell a lot of copies of it then they'll make the same amount of money. I kind of don't think they will sell. I think 30 bucks for this type of game is going to be a stretch and it's going to be the type of thing that ends up on steam sales.
3596000	3613000	Yeah I can see picking this up. I think most people will buy it for 10 bucks five the first steam sale opportunity. Yeah but I mean maybe you know again I eventually dropped 10 dollars on clicker heroes so if I drop 10 bucks on this then they made the same money off of me on either game so who knows.
3613000	3622000	Dungeon buster in chat says I heard about this story pretty bold move but their reasoning was also very interesting.
3623000	3635000	Bobby Blackwolf asks so serious question how much have you spent on Pokemon go. I there's honestly a part of me that says I don't have to answer this question.
3635000	3638000	I plead the fifth.
3641000	3647000	Do we count the devices that I bought like the Pokemon go plus and gotcha.
3647000	3663000	Although the gotcha was a gift. So do I really count that. I'm probably not easily while this game has been out a year and a half easily two hundred fifty dollars.
3663000	3671000	But how much have I paid for my Final Fantasy 14 subscription in that same time.
3671000	3680000	Probably about the same. I would say I spend about as much on this game as I do on an MMO subscription and it's it's kind of a similar thing.
3680000	3690000	You know it's interesting though I've spent more money on Pokemon that I have in ingress to which Niantic actually gets the money if that makes sense.
3690000	3695000	I mean because I put gas in my car but Niantic doesn't fucking get anything from that right right.
3695000	3709000	And Niantic. Oh to be honest they don't really sell them. I know I've bought ten dollars. No I think I gave the game twenty dollars to buy the ten dollars worth of capsules and maybe like one set of frackers ever.
3709000	3722000	But I also bought a very rare kit when I went to their anomaly. So I would say maybe over the four years I played ingress a hundred dollars tops tops on money that Niantic actually gets a part of it.
3722000	3732000	I think I spent maybe like 20 bucks and all of that was from the free Google survey thing where you get money from doing their surveys.
3732000	3735000	So technically no money but you know.
3735000	3744000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says I only ask that because you said don't even ask me I didn't think it would work. Well there you don't say I don't do things for listeners.
3745000	3758000	Rageinator says so multiply by 10 to get the real amount then. No I was I was honest with you. It's about ten dollars probably about ten dollars a month and then you figure it was thirty dollars for the first device about forty dollars the second.
3758000	3763000	Maybe a little extra money during one of the events I'd say 250 is a fair guesstimate because that game's only been out about a year and a half.
3763000	3767000	So I bet some people have spent more.
3767000	3779000	But see that's the thing is like you know like I don't have a problem with people spending that kind of money on these games because it's not that much when you're talking about the length of time that you've had the game and I can't really wants that food.
3779000	3784000	Mr. Smudge is being as I'm eating fish cake.
3784000	3786000	He probably thinks it's kitty soft food.
3786000	3791000	That's my pop.
3791000	3795000	Poor Mr. Smudge.
3796000	3798000	Okay a little bit for you.
3798000	3809000	Jamie Jamie stuck out hurt like she put just a little tiny piece in her hand to give to Mr. Smudge and like while her hand was out he fucking jumps around it up on the table and sticks his nose.
3809000	3810000	Okay.
3810000	3812000	Anyway sorry cats.
3812000	3826000	But anyways yeah so like I don't have a problem people doing that but it's like what's when you try to shapely do that after like you know like E.A. for example when you're trying to you know oh we're going to charge you sixty dollars for the game and we want you to still pay this hundred you know ten dollars a month as well.
3826000	3827000	It's like no.
3827000	3831000	Come on.
3832000	3838000	All right well we'll move on to our soccer if you're able to keep Mr. Smoosh at bay there to get to our next story.
3838000	3839000	Oh my God.
3839000	3841000	I'm I'm eating like this.
3841000	3842000	You're distracted.
3842000	3843000	Go fish.
3843000	3844000	No.
3844000	3845000	No.
3845000	3846000	Do you need me to go put him away.
3846000	3847000	Poke poke poke.
3847000	3848000	No I'm just gonna keep poking at his paws.
3848000	3849000	That's what I do with Midna.
3849000	3850000	Okay.
3850000	3854000	So basically we have some ass hole ishness.
3854000	3858000	Basically the developer gazillion who does Marvel heroes.
3858000	3859000	No.
3859000	3862000	Gee smooshy.
3862000	3863000	You're pushy smooshy.
3863000	3864000	That's what you are.
3864000	3865000	Okay I'm gonna put him away if he's too distracted.
3865000	3866000	No no no.
3866000	3867000	Okay.
3867000	3872000	So anyway basically everyone at gazillion got laid off.
3872000	3874000	They were supposed to get laid off at the end of December.
3874000	3876000	Well this happened right before Thanksgiving.
3876000	3879000	If that is not the dick move of dick moves then I don't know.
3879000	3881000	I hope they got paid through whenever.
3882000	3885000	I heard they weren't even getting like PTO cashed out and all sorts of like.
3885000	3886000	That is bullshit.
3886000	3889000	We went fucking broke today type of shit.
3889000	3890000	That is bullshit.
3890000	3891000	Yeah.
3891000	3892000	It's really unfortunate.
3892000	3898000	Yeah so anyway a good number of players of the game have already started asking for refunds
3898000	3902000	because it's been less than six months you know and they are well within their rights.
3902000	3907000	So I hope that they can get the money but then again you can't get blood out of a stone
3907000	3908000	so.
3908000	3912000	Yeah like if they couldn't even pay their employees PTO like you're not getting money
3912000	3913000	without a lawsuit.
3913000	3917000	Like it's just not going to happen unless they run it up the flagpole and go all the
3917000	3918000	way to Disney.
3918000	3923000	And if it starts to become an ugly PR thing for Disney who let's not forget owns Marvel
3923000	3927000	if it becomes an ugly PR thing for Disney then maybe something will happen.
3927000	3929000	Disney doesn't own the developer.
3929000	3930000	It doesn't matter though.
3930000	3931000	They pulled the license.
3931000	3933000	I would still have their fault.
3933000	3934000	It's still it's still an image thing.
3935000	3941000	And you know if if the whole backlash with Star Wars Battlefront 2 is anything just just
3941000	3946000	copying Disney on any all your complaints and I think you might get better traction
3946000	3948000	that way.
3948000	3953000	Well they have the money for it so no one's really worried.
3953000	3956000	They'll just up theme park prices again.
3956000	3957000	All right.
3957000	3963000	Well in all seriousness you know that is really unfortunate to those developers and so we're
3963000	3966000	thinking of the developers and hope that they can find new employment.
3966000	3971000	And it's one of those few times you see the really good side of Twitter is that I did
3971000	3975000	notice there were gaming companies like you know Blizzard and like there were some other
3975000	3979000	companies like right away were like hey if you were impacted by what happened to Gazillion
3979000	3981000	we're hiring for these positions right now.
3981000	3982000	Call us here.
3982000	3983000	Email us here.
3983000	3987000	So at least there's like yay that's the good part of social networking.
3987000	3994000	So you know we really hope the folks at Gazillion can land face up somewhere that doesn't completely
3994000	3998000	ruin the holiday for every door that closes another opens et cetera et cetera.
3998000	4000000	Let's hope that that works out.
4000000	4001000	All right.
4001000	4002000	Moving on.
4002000	4003000	Another story Loki.
4003000	4009000	So apparently Bungie has announced that they're changing the way that they're handling Destiny
4009000	4011000	2's experience points.
4011000	4017000	And this I guess comes after some players had raised questions about how the system
4017000	4018000	was rigged.
4018000	4025000	So you know basically like any other game you would earn experience points and you after
4025000	4031000	you get so much XP you level up and then once you get to level 20 which is like a your soft
4031000	4038000	cap they call it then you get a bright Ingram every time your experience bar fills up.
4038000	4043000	And so with that you can buy loot boxes and whatnot.
4043000	4049000	However they I guess had this event called Clarion Call I guess which gave bonus XP to
4049000	4055000	players when when they were joined by at least one of their clan mates.
4055000	4060000	And they were saying that during the event some players noticed that the longer they
4060000	4065000	played the slower they'd progress despite the fact that they were repeating the same
4065000	4066000	activities.
4066000	4071000	So the first time player would earn like 5000 XP and then they would see that you know
4071000	4078000	large chunk of XP bar fill in the second or third 15th time they earned the same number
4078000	4082000	of XP but the bar would fill even smaller.
4082000	4087000	So it was like a curve like that the bar was filling like at a curve rate.
4087000	4088000	Yeah.
4088000	4093000	So instead of it being you know where it was supposed to be you know this constant leveling
4093000	4099000	they were kind of tweaking it a bit to make it so that you earn those bright Ingram's
4099000	4103000	i.e. loot boxes slower and slower.
4103000	4108000	If it was just doing that with experience points I would have no problem with it.
4108000	4113000	Or it's like the gas meter in my car in reverse where like it doesn't go down like for the
4113000	4117000	longest time I'll drive around and it's like my gas meter doesn't go down at all and then
4117000	4122000	all of a sudden I'll be like on a quarter tank and just like runs to empty all of a
4122000	4123000	sudden.
4123000	4124000	So it's the reverse of that.
4124000	4129000	Well I mean I'm glad they are putting a stop to it because that's pretty shady.
4129000	4132000	Like how do you even how do you even justify that.
4132000	4133000	Yeah.
4133000	4136000	And their comment was you know we've seen the community discussion around XP gain and
4136000	4140000	destiny after reviewing our data we agree that the system is not performing the way
4140000	4141000	we'd like it to.
4141000	4145000	In other words you guys notice today we'd like to describe what's going on under the
4145000	4150000	hood and talk about what you can expect going forward with earning XP and destiny too.
4150000	4155000	How about just make the bar an accurate representation of percentages.
4155000	4157000	Like is that too much to ask.
4157000	4158000	Like I'm sorry.
4158000	4162000	Do you know how much fucking like corporate speak was just in those words that came out
4162000	4166000	of your mouth that literally meant like and I'm not blaming you.
4166000	4168000	That literally meant like oh we got caught.
4168000	4169000	Oops.
4169000	4172000	Well literally the explanation too doesn't make any sense either because it says currently
4172000	4178000	XP will scale up when playing longer or fixed duration activities like crucible competitive
4178000	4184000	multiplayer matches or Leviathan raids and says and XP will scale down when playing activities
4184000	4188000	that can be quickly repeatedly chain like public like grinding public events.
4188000	4192000	We're not happy with the results and we've heard the same from the community.
4192000	4193000	Oh fuck you.
4193000	4195000	We're not happy with the result.
4195000	4196000	Oh my God.
4196000	4197000	This system is failing us.
4197000	4198000	Bullshit.
4198000	4200000	You're unhappy that people notice and complained about it.
4200000	4205000	And this is why I never got to level 20 because I never had to see any of this stuff.
4205000	4207000	I fooled you.
4207000	4208000	It's I'm sorry.
4208000	4214000	Like I always like I always get like miffed when they just say oh yes you know we're disappointed
4214000	4219000	in the way you know we're disappointed in you know the data that we've used.
4219000	4221000	Do you fucking program the game.
4221000	4223000	You can't tell me you didn't know what was going on.
4223000	4225000	You had to plan the system out.
4225000	4231000	So you know full well how the system was working and it's just that oh you got caught.
4231000	4236000	And so now it's like oh well we're disappointed in ourselves.
4236000	4237000	We'll do better next time.
4237000	4239000	No you won't.
4239000	4240000	You won't.
4240000	4242000	I'm glad I never played it.
4242000	4243000	What's up.
4243000	4246000	Destiny 2 is like it's a beautiful game.
4246000	4248000	You know the little bits I have played on PC.
4248000	4252000	It's a gorgeous game and it is you know for somebody who doesn't even really care for shooters that much.
4252000	4253000	It is kind of fun.
4253000	4257000	But all this endgame bullshit really sounds exhausting.
4257000	4266000	Well it just sounds to me that they want people to earn those bright Ingram slower so that you get tempted to buy loot boxes.
4266000	4268000	Could be that's what I think it is.
4268000	4273000	That's how you earn loot boxes in Overwatch is you learn earn them as you gain experience playing matches.
4273000	4280000	But like Blizzard didn't feel the need to fucking lie on the bar about what percentage you are to a certain level.
4280000	4283000	It's just so weird to me.
4283000	4287000	Like who who thought that was a good idea and that they wouldn't get caught with all this.
4287000	4293000	Like hey you know if you play this event you'll get near the full experience you play it again it's going to go down or something like that.
4293000	4296000	And people are at least are aware of it.
4296000	4302000	Well here's a publisher that's been doing something and has not been quote unquote caught until now.
4302000	4304000	But this is a very different type of situation.
4304000	4307000	This is the one that kind of makes you go wow.
4307000	4309000	And this has to do with the game Axiom Verge.
4309000	4315000	And it came out this week that the publisher who's Badland Games has been doing something for Tom Happ.
4315000	4320000	Who I believe is the creator the like the soul dude behind like these games.
4320000	4323000	So anyhow Tom said in a passage here.
4323000	4327000	I'd like to take a moment to give a special shout out to the publisher Badland.
4327000	4329000	As you may have seen elsewhere on my blog and Twitter.
4329000	4331000	I try to be pretty open about my son's health situation.
4331000	4338000	In short he was born healthy but the doctors failed to treat a routine case of jaundice during a critical period when he was just days old.
4338000	4342000	The result was a lifelong condition called connectoris.
4342000	4344000	I may or may not have pronounced that right.
4344000	4350000	That is characterized by severe neurological damage which robbed my son of how much of much of his motor control and hearing.
4350000	4354000	The reason I mention this is that after we decide to move forward with Badland Games as the publisher.
4354000	4361000	They offered to donate 75% of their share to a special fund dedicated to Alistair's ongoing health care costs.
4361000	4368000	They didn't want to publicize it since none of us wanted to be seen as trying to use my son's suffering as a marketing tool for the game.
4368000	4371000	I hope this doesn't come across that come off that way.
4371000	4377000	I just wanted to thank them for their generosity and offering that up since it was definitely something they didn't have to do.
4377000	4382000	And so a lot of people have kind of gone well I'm gonna buy a second copy after hear about that.
4382000	4384000	So good guy publisher Badland Games.
4384000	4386000	Yeah my first game was good.
4386000	4387000	Oh yeah that game's great.
4387000	4392000	Axiom Verge is great especially if you kind of have that itch with Super Metroid that kind of needs to be scratched.
4392000	4395000	It's a great great game you definitely should check out.
4395000	4402000	You know I have to admit though and I don't know if it's just like the internet womp womp part of me or the fact that I've worked in health care for the past few years.
4402000	4407000	But my first thought was why are the health care companies not paying for this?
4407000	4414000	And that was kind of where my brain went. I was like why if you know everybody's supposed to have health care or you know there's always Medicaid or whatever.
4414000	4418000	But I did research and I tried to figure out what's going on. It turns out it's because of the condition.
4418000	4421000	I guess there's not a lot of...
4421000	4422000	I've heard of this.
4422000	4425000	Yeah FDA or whoever approved stuff.
4425000	4433000	So it sounds like the child's going to Mexico to get treatment where the industry is not as heavily regulated because this condition is so rare.
4433000	4440000	So I will say I kind of put it under that eye and I was like okay this makes sense. I understand why they need to raise money.
4440000	4442000	Although they've been doing it quietly.
4442000	4453000	The issue with this particular thing is it actually concerns the chemical that delivers that controls hemoglobin to deliver oxygen to the body.
4453000	4460000	And it's an excess of that. So it's pretty pretty serious. So I hope that you can find the good treatment for it.
4460000	4468000	Well I hope he's made lots of money for his son off of this game and I hope the son is able to get a little help there.
4468000	4473000	And a lot of people have kind of gone that's why that game's never on sale.
4473000	4477000	Yeah so that might kind of explain it a little bit there.
4477000	4480000	So anyhow there you go Axiom Verge a little news there with the publisher.
4480000	4481000	Let's move on.
4481000	4484000	Dar Sakura a few more stories then we'll get to the classic of the week.
4484000	4494000	Well there's been a 20 month suspension of a League of Legends champion player named who goes by Vasily Lee Wei Jun.
4494000	4500000	On his Twitch channel he screamed and threatened his girlfriend at the time.
4500000	4509000	Overturned furniture and basically issued threats severe enough to warrant a visit from the police.
4509000	4518000	And so just after that broadcast finished basically the team he was on ended their contract with him.
4518000	4522000	They just booted him out. His girlfriend left him as well she should have.
4522000	4528000	Although she said that he didn't beat her but he did smash everything around them.
4528000	4532000	And that he did the whole thing on the live stream. So it is out there.
4533000	4544000	And basically the League of Legends championship series said per their code of contact conduct sorry that he is under 20 months suspension.
4544000	4549000	And that after that expires it's up to other league teams if they want to sign him.
4549000	4567000	Although they do understand that he had a history with quote violent tendencies and that he showed physical aggression on stage by smashing a keyboard and intimidating a camera operator during a match.
4567000	4581000	They are considering looking into lifelong bans for that but this is what gets me is that well I'm sorry an indefinite ban quote fingers.
4581000	4589000	That they give indefinite bans for cheating you know for match fixing and cheating.
4589000	4595000	But they didn't put it on there for threatening the well-being of another person.
4595000	4601000	Yeah like you know with this whole story and what you're saying I was like okay okay okay okay like yep they're doing what they have to do.
4601000	4606000	Up until this part where you said he'd he'd done this type of violent shit on stage before.
4606000	4614000	Like this is an ambassador for your game and your brand on what is you know a very well watched thing on Twitch.
4614000	4620000	And like you know I you know I don't know maybe that maybe the the media hasn't gotten as in depth to this.
4620000	4627000	But like where was the fucking slap on the wrist when he was yelling at camera operators and smashing keyboards and shit.
4627000	4633000	Like that should have been squelched then. That should have been a spanking then.
4633000	4635000	Well I swear to God some people's children.
4635000	4642000	But on top of that the other thing is that they're treating you know cheating as a bigger offense than threatening another person.
4642000	4644000	Yeah yeah no I hear you loud and clear.
4644000	4652000	But they did um Riot Games did admit that it it had a wide range of offenses that would be listed underneath it.
4652000	4658000	And that they didn't anticipate having a situation where a pro player would turn out to be a domestic abuser.
4658000	4664000	I'm gonna interject one thing here. Humans no matter what they do can be garbage.
4665000	4676000	We have seen garbage like you know asshole from my state and Weinstein and all of those garbages out there being garbage.
4676000	4681000	What's to say a gamer can't be garbage like this guy. This guy is garbage.
4681000	4685000	And I'm I'm sorry they kind of had a hint.
4685000	4687000	Yeah they knew.
4687000	4691000	But no he's a game. No he's garbage.
4691000	4695000	And he should have been treated like garbage and thrown out the first time he was acting like garbage.
4695000	4700000	Or rehabilitated and recycled into something usable.
4700000	4703000	If he can even learn. I mean sometimes people who.
4703000	4704000	That's up to the person.
4704000	4709000	Yeah you have to want to change and if there's no incentive to change you're just going to keep being garbage.
4709000	4711000	Sorry if they can get away with it.
4711000	4712000	Because he was getting away with it.
4712000	4714000	Exactly.
4714000	4715000	You need to hold.
4715000	4718000	I'm sure he'll go to rehab. That's what everybody does now.
4718000	4722000	You need to hold garbage people accountable for being garbage.
4722000	4724000	End of story.
4724000	4726000	That's. Mine's over.
4726000	4728000	OK. All right.
4728000	4735000	I don't know what else to say with that. I'm looking at our chat over at live dot vodka network dot com active says hasn't anyone learned from the fighting game community.
4735000	4739000	Dungeon Buster says I'm surprised you get an indefinite ban right then and there.
4739000	4741000	I think that's about the smash keyboards itself.
4742000	4744000	William murder face says what's next.
4744000	4751000	Someone says a slur one or the other at a tournament and Riot says they did not anticipate that could happen.
4751000	4756000	Well Riot games also didn't answer why they chose 20 months instead of indefinite.
4756000	4766000	So but I mean having a policy that vague just opens the door for more abuses for things that people you have to have.
4767000	4772000	This isn't somebody playing a match on like this isn't somebody like just a user of the game.
4772000	4775000	This is a professional who's being paid to play this game.
4775000	4777000	Exactly difference.
4777000	4795000	And on top of that I mean if anything if he it should be something in the contract to there can be punitive damages for the I would expect like the negative PR that it gives the company you know that while you are playing this game you are a representative of the company.
4795000	4800000	You know it's ridiculous but no he's garbage.
4800000	4801000	All right.
4801000	4805000	Well sometimes you have to just paint over the garbage right Loki.
4805000	4807000	Yes you do.
4807000	4811000	And way to transition into talking about Splatoon 2.
4811000	4813000	I tried I really tried with that.
4813000	4814000	You tried.
4814000	4816000	Which is not hot garbage.
4816000	4817000	No it's not.
4817000	4819000	No it's a lot of fun actually.
4819000	4825000	Well actually Splatoon 2 did have a garbage weekend and it was that weekend that mayonnaise fucking one versus ketchup.
4825000	4827000	That was the best week ever.
4827000	4828000	That was garbage.
4828000	4829000	Because ketchup is disgusting.
4829000	4831000	No mayonnaise is actual garbage.
4831000	4833000	Mayonnaise is delicious.
4833000	4834000	Anyway.
4834000	4842000	Anyways so there Nintendo announced that they have quite a bit of updates coming soon to Splatoon 2.
4842000	4848000	So one of these actually is coming in mid-December which is a brand new game mode called Clam Blitz.
4848000	4853000	So in Clam Blitz you basically have to collect different clams that are scattered throughout the stage.
4853000	4861000	And after you pick one up they'll follow the player around and then you have to get them into a basket that's near the opponent's base and they have like a shield around them.
4861000	4869000	So in order to do that you collect 10 clams and then throw this power clam in there to basically score points on the first team to 100 wins.
4869000	4870000	Yay.
4870000	4873000	So that's interesting.
4873000	4877000	And then along with that of course they've got some new stuff for new battle stages coming out.
4877000	4882000	So they just released one this weekend with the shell.
4882000	4883000	What was it?
4883000	4884000	Mako Mart.
4884000	4892000	And then I guess Shellendorf Institute Walleye Warehouse and Arowana Mall are going to be coming soon.
4892000	4898000	And I guess they're saying that there's going to be new salmon run stages as well.
4898000	4905000	So I guess they're saying that the salmonoid smokeyard is going to be added to the rotation.
4905000	4906000	They have new gear.
4906000	4909000	So 140 pieces of new gear as well.
4909000	4915000	Shoes, headgear, clothes and you know these additional winter clothing as well.
4915000	4917000	New battle music.
4917000	4921000	So they've got I guess they said two new bands in the game.
4921000	4922000	New hairstyles.
4922000	4924000	They have four new hairstyles.
4924000	4926000	Two female, two male.
4926000	4930000	They've raised the level cap from 50 to 99.
4930000	4938000	And then I guess they also have the ability to I guess like prestige.
4938000	4945000	You know they would call it in Call of Duty where you can reset your level and continue raising the level from there.
4945000	4947000	New amiibo functions.
4947000	4952000	So they're going to have I guess tapping the amiibo in the game will allow you to share in-game photos.
4952000	4957000	And I don't know if it's done.
4957000	4958000	Oh we can add filters and stuff.
4958000	4960000	So we'll do those videos too I guess.
4960000	4961000	Probably too much for an amiibo.
4961000	4962000	Yeah.
4962000	4968000	And also I guess they're saying that they're going to allow you to swap gear a little bit easier.
4968000	4974000	So you'll be able to change gear between battles in regular rattle ranked battle.
4974000	4975000	Thanks God.
4975000	4977000	That was oh my God.
4977000	4979000	That was one of those things I couldn't believe wasn't in there.
4979000	4981000	You could not change your gear between that.
4981000	4982000	Thank God.
4982000	4983000	Yeah.
4983000	4984000	So that's cool.
4984000	4986000	Didn't mention though if you need the app for that.
4986000	4990000	Wasn't that one of the ways one of the things that the app was for is like switching gear.
4990000	4991000	No you could.
4991000	4994000	It was like additional gear you could buy and you could get it.
4994000	5002000	I don't want to say the shady marketplace but it just kind of was you know it was just another way to buy gear basically and different stuff.
5002000	5005000	And you can also see like what teams your friends are on and so forth.
5005000	5008000	The chat room is saying that the update is live already by the way.
5008000	5010000	This isn't something that is coming.
5010000	5012000	It's done already here.
5012000	5014000	Well yes some of the things I know that were coming.
5014000	5019000	But they mentioned that you know one of the stages was released and then the rest were coming soon.
5019000	5020000	Got it.
5020000	5021000	So I didn't think it'd be like the very next day.
5021000	5025000	Well then this is the good news that you know all of it's free essentially.
5025000	5030000	And this is the good thing that Nintendo has not figured out loot boxes yet.
5030000	5031000	Can't get that online.
5031000	5032000	Am I right?
5032000	5033000	Yeah.
5033000	5034000	All right.
5034000	5038000	Act F says yeah you buy special gear through the app not change.
5038000	5042000	Fifth Dream asked can we get this update for Final Fantasy 15 Comrades 2 please.
5042000	5044000	That's one of those things I need to go back and visit.
5044000	5046000	I still need the playthrough 15.
5046000	5047000	Oh you should.
5047000	5049000	It's worth playing through.
5049000	5053000	I know it's just I'll do it one of these days.
5053000	5060000	Maybe like a whole maybe 2018 I just buy no games and just play through like 500 games I have in my backlog.
5060000	5064000	Bobby Black Wolf in chat says Nintendo definitely figured out loot boxes.
5064000	5067000	What happened at the end of every stage in Super Mario Brothers 3.
5067000	5072000	Yeah but if you would run and get your P meter full and jump at a 45 degree angle you could hack those loot boxes.
5072000	5073000	You always get a star.
5073000	5075000	That's what the toad houses were for though.
5075000	5076000	That's true.
5076000	5077000	You could hack that game too though.
5077000	5078000	Yeah I remember that too.
5078000	5081000	Wasn't it based on where like the Hammer Brothers was or something like that.
5081000	5086000	There's a certain place on the screen that you look and every time you push the button in that position and that's where it'll stop.
5087000	5088000	Anyway.
5090000	5093000	So yeah you can hack the shit out of that stuff because it's not online.
5093000	5095000	I say hack but it's not really hacking.
5095000	5099000	That's just getting good as they say.
5099000	5105000	Alright hey one of the games that I really liked and I don't remember if this game had loot boxes.
5105000	5106000	I guess it kind of did.
5106000	5107000	It had a loot wheel.
5107000	5110000	But I don't remember buying spins on the loot wheel.
5110000	5111000	Maybe that was something you could do.
5111000	5113000	I don't know but it's Forza Horizon is what I'm talking about.
5113000	5117000	And Forza Horizon is by a developer called Playground Games.
5117000	5124000	And what happened is that they actually announced back in February that they are making a non-racing game.
5124000	5125000	Gasp.
5125000	5128000	Which sadly does that mean we're not getting Forza Horizon 4?
5128000	5130000	Or did that get passed to a different developer?
5130000	5132000	Or is there two teams now there?
5132000	5133000	I don't know.
5133000	5134000	We don't know about that.
5134000	5135000	But anyway.
5136000	5140000	All we know about this non-racing game is it's an open world game.
5140000	5144000	But they are apparently working based on new reports.
5144000	5146000	It's an open world action RPG.
5147000	5154000	They have hired talent from Metal Gear Solid, Hellblade, Suna's Sacrifice, and GTA 5.
5154000	5158000	This all comes in a report from gameindustry.biz.
5158000	5164000	And they obtained the new details on this studio that they're forming to work on the RPG.
5164000	5171000	So Playground brought Sean Istone, Will Kennedy, and Juan Fernandez de Simon on the project.
5171000	5174000	And they are all from those different teams I named a little bit ago.
5175000	5179000	So they said, we're delighted we've secured a second studio to house our new team.
5179000	5180000	Oh, there's the answer.
5180000	5184000	This is a hugely exciting project that is already attracting world class talent to Playground.
5184000	5189000	The combination of New Blood and experienced Playground team members is already showing huge promise.
5189000	5194000	And I'm excited to see this talented group contribute to Playground's continued success.
5194000	5196000	That is all from CEO Gavin Rayburn.
5196000	5197000	So there you go.
5197000	5198000	Awesome.
5199000	5202000	Yeah, I'm really excited to see what they come up with then.
5202000	5203000	And that's good.
5203000	5206000	That means that Forza Horizon 4 really could still happen.
5206000	5208000	And it could just all be the Hot Wheels thing.
5210000	5211000	It'll be on...
5212000	5215000	What was that game that Atari did back in the game with the loop?
5215000	5217000	Hard Drivin'? Was that the game?
5217000	5218000	Yeah.
5218000	5219000	Yeah, it's just...
5219000	5221000	Forza Horizon just needs to go full on hard driving.
5221000	5222000	Oh, the nap machine.
5223000	5224000	What, the what?
5224000	5225000	Hard Drivin', the nap machine.
5225000	5228000	Oh yeah, the cabinet was so big you could get in there and take a nap.
5228000	5229000	I used to.
5229000	5230000	At work.
5230000	5231000	It's like the old Test Drive games.
5231000	5232000	Yeah, yeah, right.
5232000	5233000	The old Test Drive games.
5233000	5234000	They were like...
5234000	5235000	I do.
5235000	5237000	The graphics were as shitty as the hard driving.
5238000	5240000	Dungeon Busters Suggest in chat.
5240000	5243000	Kingdoms of Forza, The Reckoning, minus Curt Schilling.
5243000	5244000	Let's hope so.
5244000	5246000	I don't think that guy's ever gonna make it...
5246000	5248000	I want a racing game that's set in the medieval times.
5248000	5250000	Or you just fight with...
5250000	5253000	It's an action RPG featuring just real racing cars.
5254000	5255000	You just...
5255000	5256000	I don't know.
5256000	5259000	Alright, let's take a trip down memory lane.
5259000	5261000	The classic game of the week.
5261000	5263000	Back in the day when...
5263000	5264000	You didn't have your...
5264000	5268000	Your studios were limited to three cartridges in a calendar year.
5268000	5272000	And if you were gonna make more games than that, you just had to open up a second wing.
5272000	5274000	Hello Ultra Games, Tommy.
5274000	5275000	See what you're doing there?
5275000	5277000	It's a classic game of the week.
5278000	5280000	You know that was a thing, right?
5280000	5282000	That because the Atari 2600 went...
5282000	5285000	Because there were just garbage games coming out for it.
5285000	5290000	But if you wanted your games to come out on Nintendo, Nintendo limited you to three games a year.
5290000	5291000	Ten games a year.
5291000	5295000	But that's when somebody reversed it to your cartridge.
5295000	5296000	I'm sorry, I'm not telling you.
5296000	5298000	What's the other one in another Konami studio that was...
5298000	5299000	It was Ultra.
5299000	5300000	Ultra, that's right.
5300000	5303000	Ultra put out the Ninja Turtles game in Metal Gear, didn't they?
5303000	5304000	Yeah.
5304000	5305000	Metal Gear Stakes Adventures.
5305000	5307000	Anyway, the classic game of the week.
5307000	5310000	This particular selection was after all that though, actually, right?
5310000	5311000	Yes.
5311000	5313000	Whale, whale, after that.
5313000	5316000	This is actually one of those it just turned 10 picks, right?
5316000	5317000	Yes, it did.
5317000	5321000	Super Mario Galaxy came out in 2007.
5321000	5325000	It came out for the Wii.
5325000	5328000	Remember how much shit we gave them for the Wii?
5328000	5330000	Let's suppose that you're writing a really...
5330000	5332000	I thought I got rid of ads on...
5332000	5334000	Oh, I switched my browser, that's why.
5334000	5335000	Girl.
5335000	5336000	Sorry about that, guys.
5336000	5345000	Anyway, it also was released in 2011 as a Nintendo Selects title and downloadable via
5345000	5348000	the Wii U's eShop in 2015.
5348000	5354000	Mario has to go rescue Princess Peach while saving the universe from Bowser this time.
5354000	5358000	Because, like, bitch ain't got other things to do.
5358000	5363000	So basically the galaxies were all like little planets.
5363000	5370000	And you had different variations of gravity, different things that could go on, you'd have
5370000	5373000	different platforms to move around.
5373000	5379000	And basically it took concepts that came from Super Mario 128, which was a tech demonstration
5379000	5383000	from Nintendo Space World in 2000.
5383000	5388000	The development began just after that tech demo came out.
5388000	5397000	And it was actually after the release of Donkey Kong Jungle Beat in 2004 is when that came up.
5397000	5403000	And it was actually a suggestion by Miyamoto himself that Nintendo should commission another
5403000	5405000	large-scale Mario game.
5405000	5408000	And so it was...
5408000	5409000	There you go.
5409000	5416000	It also was one of the first Mario games that had a symphony orchestra with music composed
5416000	5422000	by Koji Kondo and Mahito Yokota.
5422000	5425000	Sorry, not Yokota, that's the wrong word.
5425000	5431000	Anyway, it was really considered to be one of the best games of its era.
5431000	5433000	I mean, even today.
5433000	5436000	It won game of the year across many boards.
5436000	5442000	And it was the first Nintendo title to win the British Academy games award for best games.
5442000	5444000	So there you go.
5444000	5448000	It is the ninth best-selling Wii game worldwide.
5448000	5453000	And the best-selling 3D Mario, Super Mario entry.
5453000	5457000	And of course it had a sequel, Super Mario Galaxy 2.
5457000	5460000	It came out for the Wii in 2010.
5460000	5469000	So you would use it, you know, you played it as many games did with the Wiimote and the Nunchuck.
5469000	5472000	Mario's abilities came from Super Mario 64.
5472000	5476000	So he had all of his fun jumps in the somersaults.
5476000	5481000	And he had the star pointer that would show you...
5481000	5489000	It would show up when you pointed the Wiimote at the screen so that you could find different star bits
5489000	5491000	that looked like a Conpetto.
5491000	5494000	So it was really, really just a neat little game.
5494000	5496000	You got your power-ups.
5496000	5500000	You have the spring suit and the boo suit and the bee suit.
5500000	5506000	And your health meter was a three-piece health meter.
5506000	5510000	Just the usual stuff that you expect in a Mario game.
5510000	5517000	You could get your 50 coins without losing a life or 50 star bits or 1-up mushroom to get you extra lives.
5517000	5523000	And then you had co-star mode where one person controls Mario
5523000	5528000	and the other one basically has a second star pointer that you can shoot at enemies with.
5528000	5532000	So it was really well received overall.
5532000	5538000	The game was a novel concept for when it came out too, just with it using gravity the way it was.
5538000	5541000	And it was really considered just a fun game.
5541000	5544000	The music was fantastic.
5544000	5550000	Like I said, it was orchestral with a 50 person symphony orchestra.
5550000	5553000	And it fit the game quite well.
5553000	5555000	It sold great.
5555000	5559000	And it has the sixth highest rating on Metacritic.
5559000	5563000	It was a 97 out of 100 based on 73 reviews at the time.
5563000	5570000	So even while Famitsu doesn't really give out perfect scores that much,
5570000	5572000	they gave them a 38 out of 40.
5572000	5576000	So they got really, really fantastic ratings.
5576000	5578000	And so there we go.
5578000	5580000	It is a pretty fucking great Mario game.
5580000	5581000	Yeah.
5581000	5584000	And so that's the game, Super Mario Galaxy.
5584000	5586000	I kinda can't believe it's 10 years old.
5586000	5588000	Thwomp, thwomp.
5588000	5590000	Thwomp, thwomp.
5590000	5591000	Thwomp, thwomp.
5591000	5592000	Blarg, blarg.
5592000	5597000	All right, there it is, your classic game of the week for the Wii, Super Mario Galaxy,
5597000	5603000	which the chat room, by the way, did catch and called out your Freudian slip earlier in the show.
5603000	5606000	Oh, that's why she said Mario Galaxy at the beginning of the show.
5606000	5612000	That actually wasn't why I said it, but I had been listening to the music before coming up here.
5612000	5614000	And now we're going to open the maple cookies.
5614000	5615000	All right.
5615000	5616000	Yay, cookies.
5616000	5617000	That means we're going to take a break.
5617000	5618000	Have Hokkaido Momiji cookies.
5618000	5619000	Sure.
5619000	5621000	Just make sure Mr. Smoosh doesn't try to eat them all.
5621000	5622000	All right.
5622000	5624000	His ears perked when I said that.
5624000	5626000	That cat is going to ruin this show.
5626000	5627000	We're going to take a quick break.
5627000	5628000	We're going to come back, though.
5628000	5632000	There's much more show to come, including another Iwata tribute.
5632000	5633000	I think it's really cute.
5633000	5634000	We're going to get to in rapid fire news.
5634000	5640000	We're also going to talk about what's going on in Pokemon Go, besides me spending money, and theme parks,
5640000	5644000	when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
5650000	5653000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
5653000	5661000	Live tonight, episode number 708 for this November the 26th of 2017, enjoying those last few minutes of the long weekend.
5661000	5668000	For those of you that got a long weekend, I know some of you brave souls work in retail and other industries that have you working over the weekend.
5668000	5671000	Even I worked on Friday, which is weird.
5671000	5674000	I have the type of office job that usually isn't there on Black Friday.
5674000	5682000	But we were there, so I didn't get a full weekend, but I had a nice restful Saturday and Sunday after the fact.
5682000	5685000	So I hope you guys had a nice restful weekend as well.
5685000	5692000	During the break, I know we can't play these on the podcast because, you know, we can't distribute someone else's songs and all that stuff.
5692000	5696000	But we did play a song randomly from Soul Calibur during the music break tonight.
5696000	5701000	And some folks in chat, Vid Power, said, I hope they make another Soul Calibur game again.
5701000	5703000	And Fifth Dream says, yes, we need Soul Calibur badly.
5703000	5709000	Well, it didn't make the show roll tonight because we addressed it a little bit last week.
5709000	5713000	There are heavy rumors picking up about Soul Calibur 6.
5713000	5720000	But now, I feel like Namco Bandai, because of that rumor, started putting out conflicting rumors this week.
5720000	5728000	Meaning, like, now we're hearing, oh, it's not being unveiled at PSX, it's being unveiled at the Video Game Awards.
5728000	5734000	And, oh, the bonus character on Nintendo is not Link, it's one of the Fire Emblem characters instead.
5734000	5737000	So, there's a lot of, like, noise out there on that front.
5737000	5740000	But it does sound like one way or another, Soul Calibur 6 is going to happen.
5740000	5744000	Which makes sense. I mean, those Soul Calibur games have always sold pretty well, haven't they?
5744000	5749000	It's been a while. Soul Calibur 5 was a PlayStation 3 exclusive, if I'm right, right?
5749000	5751000	Did they put that anywhere else? I think.
5751000	5756000	I know 4 was on Xbox 360 because 4 had Yoda, Invader, and all that stuff, right?
5756000	5758000	Yoda. Yoda.
5758000	5762000	But 5 was only on PlayStation 3, if I remember right.
5762000	5766000	So, it'll be interesting to see what they do with 6. It does seem like it should be time for that.
5766000	5771000	Fifth Dream in Chat says, Soul Calibur 6 should be insanely beautiful on PlayStation 4 Pro.
5771000	5777000	Bob Coffee says, Soul Calibur 6 probably won't happen until Tekken 7 is done, I imagine.
5777000	5779000	Eh, there could be different teams. Who knows?
5779000	5783000	JD says 5 was also on 360. Okay, I must've missed that.
5783000	5788000	4 was the one that had Yoda, Invader, right? I didn't get that confused.
5789000	5794000	No, okay, I know what it is. Soul Calibur 3 was a PlayStation 2 exclusive, right?
5794000	5798000	That was when they first spread out, like the hula hoop girl and the...
5798000	5803000	Yeah, some of those other characters. So, who was the character in Soul Calibur 5?
5803000	5805000	Who was the bonus character they put in that?
5805000	5807000	Was 5 Vader? Or was that 4?
5807000	5812000	No, that was 4. I don't remember who the bonus characters were.
5812000	5814000	Was it Kratos?
5814000	5816000	That sounds right. I think you're right.
5816000	5818000	Was it Kratos and then was it Higachi?
5818000	5820000	Ezio. Ezio.
5820000	5823000	That's right. I think Ezio was on both.
5823000	5827000	Yeah, the game's guest character is Ezio from Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.
5827000	5829000	That's what it was.
5829000	5830000	Oh.
5830000	5834000	There it is. And then they're saying Kratos in chat as well.
5834000	5836000	So, there you go. I don't see that in the Wiki article.
5836000	5839000	I thought that was only on, well obviously only on Linzoni.
5839000	5841000	And then...
5841000	5843000	Yeah.
5843000	5846000	No, that was Dead or Alive.
5846000	5848000	Never mind.
5848000	5850000	Yeah. Yeah, Soul Calibur 5 with Ezio.
5850000	5853000	Okay, it's been a while. I mean, it's been a while since those games were out.
5853000	5856000	So, we're due for Soul Calibur 6. I'm sure it's gonna happen.
5856000	5861000	Anyway, let's get to some rapid fire news and quickly talk about some other stuff going on in the gaming world. Loki.
5861000	5867000	So, this is just silly, but apparently, you know, Sonic Forces has the whole create your own Sonic character that they have in there.
5867000	5871000	Quickly. Kratos was on the handheld spinoff. That's why we're getting confused.
5871000	5874000	Because there was a Soul Calibur on the handheld. That's where Kratos was.
5874000	5876000	I thought he was also on the console.
5876000	5878000	That's where we're getting confused. Anyway, go ahead.
5878000	5884000	Anyways, so Sonic Forces, you know, they have the whole thing where you can actually design your own Sonic character to play as in the game.
5884000	5893000	So now, they have an update. I guess it's free DLC where you can get a Sanic t-shirt for your character.
5893000	5894000	That's right, Sanic.
5894000	5896000	But can you get a Princess Zordla shirt?
5896000	5898000	Nah, Princess Zordla. I'm sorry.
5898000	5899000	Zordla!
5899000	5900000	Just the Sanic.
5900000	5901000	Danky Kang.
5901000	5904000	Just the Sanic Hedgehog t-shirt. So, that's kind of funny.
5904000	5905000	What about Patch?
5905000	5910000	I kind of love how meme-aware the Sonic social media team is.
5910000	5911000	It's pretty great.
5911000	5913000	It is pretty funny. At least they can poke fun at themselves.
5913000	5918000	If only they would be aware that we fucking want PSO2. But hey. Or PSO2, excuse me. But hey.
5919000	5928000	And in other Sonic news, apparently there has been a new patch that's been created for Sonic 3D Blast.
5928000	5937000	And this is actually a patch that was developed by, I guess, one of the lead programmers and founders of Traveler's Tales who does the LEGO games now.
5937000	5944000	And I guess he was one of the original lead programmers as well of the game.
5944000	5947000	Apparently, yeah, he's in the...
5947000	5949000	What did he do here?
5949000	5960000	Because Sonic 3D is a part of the Sonic legacy, and Sonic had a mixed legacy, I'd like to address where I can my part in that.
5960000	5970000	If I can make Sonic 3D a bit more acceptable to the Sonic fan base within a few days of my time, then great. Why not try it?
5970000	5977000	So he has a Sonic 3D Blast, or Sonic 3D Blast DX, the director's cut.
5977000	5987000	I'm not exactly sure what they changed on it to make it better, because I didn't really play a lot of Sonic 3D Blast.
5987000	5994000	Yeah, that game's kind of hard to get into, honestly. But that's, you know, out of the Sonic games.
5994000	6001000	So they fixed some of the handling in the game, it looks like. They have a time challenge mode.
6001000	6004000	They set a better camera.
6004000	6009000	I guess you can save passwords. There's a level editor.
6009000	6013000	A crab, I guess, was in a prototype thing.
6013000	6020000	Difficulty tweaks, options, pallets, a lot of new stuff. So that's kind of cool.
6020000	6024000	And I'm not sure where you can get the patch, but I'm sure this is the internet. Google it.
6024000	6028000	Alright, let's talk about some tournament news.
6028000	6033000	Actually, I've got some updates on Genesis 5, which is a tournament not far from here.
6033000	6038000	It's going to be in Oakland this year, at the Oakland Convention Center, running January, I think it's 19th through the 21st.
6038000	6044000	And actually they're saying that the finals, the top 8 finals, will be at the Paramount Theater, which is a real gorgeous concert venue.
6044000	6049000	I saw Bjork there, back in the day. That was on the Vesper Teen Tour, that's how long ago that was.
6049000	6055000	But anyway, so that's pretty cool that the Genesis tournament, and not to be confused with Sega Genesis, sorry.
6055000	6063000	It's actually mostly a fighting game tournament, and they announced that Street Fighter 5 is going to be there, but also some older hits.
6063000	6068000	And I think this is really cool, including Super Smash Brothers, the original, as well as Melee and Wii U.
6068000	6073000	DDR Extreme, they're going to have a contest on. That's pretty rad.
6073000	6078000	Not the newer DDRs, DDR Extreme, the one that we had during that long period.
6078000	6082000	DDR USA, let's go that far back, or fourth next year.
6082000	6090000	So these are all additions for Saturday only, Marvel vs. Capcom, Infinite in there too, Pokken, Tournament DX, Act After You Listening.
6090000	6094000	All those games are going to be there for Genesis, so that's really awesome.
6094000	6099000	I noticed Splatoon 2 is going to be one of the games they're doing a tournament on as well, so that'll be fun.
6099000	6104000	Hey, speaking of tournaments, this one caught my eye, another news for this.
6104000	6112000	January 27th, also in the Bay Area, namely San Jose at Round 1, there's going to be a DDR tournament.
6112000	6115000	And this is really trying to be like an old school DDR tournament.
6115000	6119000	They are calling this Freestyle Takeover, is the name of this tournament.
6119000	6124000	It was just announced, and it was announced of course on 20 November, which was on Monday.
6124000	6128000	And you can get tickets on Eventbrite, although I believe it's going to be free just to go watch.
6128000	6133000	But it is $15 to compete, and I think it is a pure freestyle tournament.
6133000	6137000	I haven't seen anything for, yeah, and it even says in the about,
6137000	6141000	a devoted community has kept the game alive through technical feats, score-based feats.
6141000	6145000	Freestyle has laid dominant for years, or dormant, excuse me, dormant for years.
6145000	6152000	And I know a friend of the show who's been on way back in the day, Mel B, this is who's Facebook that I caught it on,
6152000	6157000	and I wonder if he's going to do a new freestyle routine all these years later.
6157000	6162000	It sounds like a lot of these guys that were kind of, you know, well known for freestyling back in the old school days of DDR
6162000	6167000	in the earlier days of the show, might be dusting them shoes off to do some new freestyle routines.
6167000	6171000	So this would be a lot of fun. Dark Sakura, maybe we should go find some orange bats.
6171000	6174000	I still have mine.
6174000	6180000	Maybe we could enter, I don't know. Anyway, the first thing I said to Mel when I heard about this was,
6180000	6184000	how can we help here at OLR, because we're still here all these years later.
6184000	6190000	I would love to go just say hello, and you know, even if maybe we can like donate a prize or something, we'll figure something out.
6191000	6195000	I'm sure I have like old VRares and stuff that I was never able to give away back in the day.
6195000	6198000	I could throw into a prize pot or something, so we'll figure that out.
6198000	6203000	But anyway, I know I'm planning on going. Hopefully my co-host can make a cameo as well.
6203000	6206000	That'll be the end of next month.
6215000	6217000	Moving on, Dark Sakura.
6217000	6224000	Well, there is more coming out for The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild.
6224000	6228000	Something that's more of a little gift.
6228000	6233000	But basically, hold on just a second.
6233000	6240000	Basically, if you duck down and open a chest, Link will throw out a punching animation.
6241000	6247000	Basically, it's just like a little thing that they've discovered.
6247000	6250000	It was on the Tips from the Wild news channel.
6250000	6252000	So it's just a neat thing.
6252000	6263000	And then in other news, Pokemon Ultra Sun and Moon have a tribute to Satoru Iwata.
6264000	6278000	Basically, in this particular one, if you visit the Game Freak building while having a gold or silver Pokemon in your party,
6278000	6283000	they will say that the developers were helped out by an amazing guy.
6283000	6286000	So there you go.
6286000	6291000	Yeah, that's a really cute little tribute in the Pokemon games.
6291000	6295000	I kind of skipped buying them because I never finish Pokemon games.
6295000	6298000	And I'm waiting for the Switch version at this point.
6298000	6300000	That's kind of where I'm at.
6300000	6303000	But I've heard some good feedback on Ultra Sun and Moon.
6303000	6305000	Maybe I'll change my mind.
6305000	6307000	I keep hearing it as ultrasound.
6307000	6311000	Alright, let's travel around the world and check out what games are coming out this week.
6311000	6314000	Although I have a feeling it's going to be really slow, right, Loki?
6314000	6317000	Yeah, it's definitely slowing down towards the end of the year.
6317000	6322000	Especially after the first few months of November, it's just dead until March.
6322000	6329000	So we've got, starting off, Resident Evil Revelations and Resident Evil Revelations 2 on the Nintendo Switch.
6329000	6333000	Little Witch Academia, Chamber of Time on PlayStation 4.
6333000	6336000	Siberia 2 on the Nintendo Switch.
6336000	6341000	The game, Paradise Cruise and Mix on PC and PlayStation 4.
6341000	6345000	7, The Days Long Gone on PC.
6345000	6349000	And finally Xenoblade Chronicles 2 on Nintendo Switch.
6349000	6351000	That's it.
6351000	6354000	Alright, traveling to Japan on November 30th.
6354000	6359000	Little Witch Academia Toki no Mahoutou Nanafushi comes out.
6359000	6361000	There's a new Nobunaga game this week.
6361000	6365000	Nobunaga no Yabu Taishi comes out on November 30th.
6365000	6368000	As well as Game Paradise Cruise and Mix.
6368000	6371000	That same game I think Loki just referenced here in the US.
6371000	6373000	That is also out in Japan.
6373000	6376000	Sounds like there's a new Dragon Quest Slime Controller.
6376000	6379000	Because you can never have enough Dragon Quest Slime Controllers.
6379000	6384000	On the Vita this week, Uso Suki Shangri-La comes out in a regular and limited edition.
6384000	6388000	As well as Gakuen Club Himitsu no Night Club.
6388000	6390000	That's like school club something.
6390000	6392000	It's always school games, isn't it?
6392000	6394000	On the Nintendo Switch, guess what?
6394000	6399000	Nobunaga no Yabu also on the Switch in regular and treasure box editions.
6399000	6402000	So I'm assuming this is the first Nobunaga game on Switch.
6402000	6403000	So that's pretty cool.
6403000	6406000	Biohazard Revelations, which of course means Resident Evil.
6406000	6408000	The collection and the unveiled edition.
6408000	6410000	Also out in Japan this week.
6410000	6416000	And a whole bunch of different accessories and pouches if you are looking to carry your Nintendo Switch in a hip new way.
6416000	6419000	One more game worth mentioning on the Nintendo 3DS.
6419000	6421000	Act F, are you listening up?
6421000	6426000	Kirby Battle Deluxe is out this week on November 30th on the 3DS.
6426000	6432000	And if you've been holding off on it, Monster Hunter XX gets a price reduction this week.
6432000	6436000	And maybe Dark Sakura would be interested in the Dragon Ball Extreme Fusion Pack.
6436000	6439000	Alright, how about the UK Dark Sakura?
6439000	6442000	Just a couple of things on the 28th.
6442000	6448000	Black Mirror for Playstation 4 and Xbox One and Game Dev Tycoon for iPad and iPhone.
6448000	6451000	Black Mirror like the show?
6451000	6454000	Because that would be pretty awesome if there's a game based on the show.
6454000	6459000	Yeah, I was actually seeing that on the release chart I was looking at here.
6459000	6462000	I know they have a new season coming out. I saw the trailer for that.
6462000	6463000	They do.
6463000	6466000	Is there something about a reboot of the game?
6466000	6472000	Gothic Point and Click Adventure Black Mirror is getting a reboot by THQ Nordic.
6472000	6474000	Oh, well that's not unfortunately what I'm looking at.
6474000	6477000	No, it is not related to the TV show.
6477000	6479000	That is kind of interesting though that they have...
6479000	6481000	That looks kind of neat though.
6481000	6484000	I'm curious to see what that looks like in motion. It kind of looks like the seventh guest to me.
6484000	6486000	And some of those things.
6486000	6488000	Alright, sorry I guess Chat Room is yelling at me.
6488000	6493000	It's Monster Hunter Double Cross which shows you how long ago I kind of...
6493000	6495000	I tried to get it to the one on Wii U.
6495000	6497000	That shows you how little Rob cares.
6497000	6499000	Well, I don't want to say that because some people are into it.
6499000	6501000	It's just Monster Hunter Kiss Kiss. That's all it is.
6501000	6505000	Kiss Kiss. Monster Hunter Kiss Kiss. I like that better.
6505000	6508000	Alright, let's get to the mailbag.
6508000	6511000	You guys email us and we try to respond.
6511000	6512000	Try.
6512000	6516000	Unless we forget, which I guess is the case with one of our emails this week.
6516000	6518000	Participate at OrangeOnTrader.com.
6518000	6520000	This is the place to send your emails.
6520000	6522000	Let's get to it.
6522000	6523000	Okay.
6523000	6526000	Hey, OLR crew, AZHP here.
6526000	6528000	I'm a bit behind on your podcast.
6528000	6532000	Due to just recently getting married and being in Japan on my honeymoon, Mazel Tov.
6532000	6533000	Congrats.
6533000	6539000	And I wanted to chime in about a story you had on October 23rd about IGN acquiring Humble Bundle.
6539000	6547000	You all, like many other people, are under the continued assumption that Humble Bundle is still only a bundle portal which has sliders for charity.
6547000	6550000	I am not under that impression. You are wrong.
6550000	6552000	Because I know they have a store portal.
6552000	6555000	I'm just not good at the impression that IGN's evil. That's all.
6555000	6561000	I think it's been a while. And this was, to be fair to the emailer, this is the one that we forgot to read when it first came in.
6561000	6563000	And I don't know how we skipped it. So sorry about that.
6563000	6566000	But I'm trying to remember where we were at.
6566000	6569000	But yeah, I know they have a storefront because that's one of the things.
6569000	6572000	I've known this for a while. I've bought games to them before.
6572000	6577000	But to be fair, I think most people know it from the bundles.
6577000	6579000	Like, you know, at least that's kind of where it started.
6579000	6580000	Yeah, but way to assume.
6580000	6582000	Yeah, well, I don't know. I have to go back and listen to the episode.
6582000	6585000	It's very possible we were focusing on that element of it.
6585000	6595000	Anyway, the truth is Humble Bundle has for some time been a straight up video game storefront similar to Steam and Origin.
6595000	6602000	IGN is likely buying them because they see future in the storefront and the publishing arm, not in the charity bundle aspect.
6603000	6612000	Loki also mentioned that there were potential conflicts of interest arising from Humble Bundle published games being reviewed by IGN as a publication.
6612000	6619000	While this is a valid concern, as a former employee I will be the first to say that IGN had scummy business practices as all hell.
6619000	6626000	The editors took their job seriously and didn't let publishers and marketing teams strong arm them in deducing review scores for the sake of the deal.
6626000	6632000	It's been five or so years since I've been there. They could certainly have changed, but I don't see a cause for concern there.
6632000	6638000	I know I made it. Loki's like, was that the cat? No, that was me making a nervous noise because I don't.
6638000	6644000	OK, no, I appreciate the honest insight. I just.
6644000	6647000	It's very blunt feedback, that's all I'm saying.
6647000	6653000	Nobody said that while they had scummy practices, their editing was serious.
6653000	6655000	OK, and they they gave fair reviews.
6655000	6662000	That's fair. So I also found it funny that Loki said it would be like if Fox News bought Humble Bundle and that'd be pretty sketchy.
6662000	6667000	I don't know if you all were aware, but Fox News did in fact own IGN for a significant period of time.
6667000	6671000	Yes, I'm well aware of that. And Rupert Murdoch was totally signing our paychecks.
6671000	6674000	Yes, I'm well aware of that. Wow, I forgot.
6674000	6679000	However, this influence only extended as far as the upper management treating employees mercilessly.
6679000	6688000	Working passionate people, thankless, long hours and canning them when they were no longer needed and never manifesting as any sort of spin that was required for articles and reviews.
6688000	6696000	You know, I hate to say it because this is going to sound really just like like I don't care, unempathetic.
6696000	6700000	But like, isn't that the like entirety of the game industry?
6700000	6708000	Not I'm not saying it's right, but I'm just saying, like, unfortunately, I hear this about a lot of places.
6708000	6714000	I guess it really comes down to where do people feel valued and where do they not?
6714000	6725000	Most of the editors I was friends with were free thinking, free spirited people through and through and would certainly not have been there if they were forced to spend things in the way that Fox News was.
6725000	6732000	Anyway, that was a bit of a ramble and I apologize, but those are my two cents on a Humble Bundle acquisition.
6732000	6738000	As someone who used to work for IGN and has a somewhat jaded view on the matter, yours truly AZHP.
6738000	6744000	Well, I'm sorry that we missed your email, but we didn't miss the second version.
6744000	6748000	Thank you for that very blunt and candid feedback.
6748000	6750000	I like blunt.
6750000	6752000	No, I mean, don't get me wrong. I like it.
6752000	6754000	I just, you know.
6754000	6758000	I don't censor anything unless you say something shitty.
6758000	6760000	And that's like actually.
6761000	6766000	Or if the person says don't read this on air, we usually are not going to do that.
6766000	6767000	Well, you know.
6767000	6771000	So we have another email that came through the site.
6771000	6775000	I've been listening for the last few years. I've enjoyed the show during my commute.
6775000	6780000	Thanks for the great show. I was wondering if there's a game you've been given crap for liking.
6780000	6788000	I was recently playing games with my friends the other day and they were roasting me for being a fan of the Kingdom Hearts games because of this cringe worthy writing.
6788000	6791000	Has this happened to you before? This is signed by Chris.
6794000	6797000	I generally like awesome games, so no.
6797000	6800000	I mean, most of us, we all kind of like a lot of the same stuff.
6800000	6804000	Let me give you an example. Are there any MMOs you've been playing recently, Jamie?
6804000	6805000	Girl.
6805000	6807000	No. Are there any MMOs you've been playing recently?
6807000	6808000	No, actually.
6808000	6809000	Really? Nothing?
6809000	6813000	Because I haven't re-upped on the two and I'm not playing Ragnarok online.
6813000	6814000	Addict.
6816000	6817000	I haven't touched it.
6817000	6822000	I was trying to set her up for an addict joke, but then she had to dodge all over that question.
6822000	6824000	Well, because I really wasn't playing anything.
6824000	6826000	I know, but that's usually us giving each other shit.
6826000	6829000	Wouldn't it be great if we had an Animal Crossing MMO for reals?
6829000	6831000	That's what they could do on the Switch.
6831000	6833000	They could, but are they? No.
6833000	6834000	No, I'm not going to hold my breath.
6834000	6835000	Bitches.
6835000	6836000	An MMO on a Nintendo platform.
6837000	6841000	Hey, it will be fucking noteworthy if it ever does happen. Just saying.
6841000	6843000	We'll give it ten years.
6844000	6849000	Oh, yeah. Thank you, Bobby. I should have just got her to talk about Mass Effect.
6849000	6851000	Then I could have said Addict.
6851000	6852000	Mass Effect is free.
6852000	6854000	How many followers does your Tumblr have now?
6854000	6855000	1,100.
6855000	6856000	Addict.
6856000	6859000	No, no, no, serious. No, that's not me being added.
6859000	6862000	That's people being addicted to my product.
6865000	6866000	I'm going to get Mr...
6866000	6867000	They have the demand.
6867000	6869000	Eight plus quality alien penis.
6869000	6874000	I have to get more followers for Mr. Smoosh on Instagram.
6874000	6875000	I'm just kidding.
6875000	6877000	Mr. Smoosh will smoosh the competition.
6877000	6879000	All you have to do is be as witty as I am.
6880000	6881000	I don't know if I can do that.
6882000	6885000	So, games that we get shit for liking.
6885000	6890000	Probably my cell phone stuff, like Ingress and Pokemon Go.
6890000	6891000	I definitely...
6891000	6892000	What was that one game...
6892000	6894000	I've been given shit for both of those.
6894000	6896000	That we were building the apartments in?
6897000	6898000	Tiny Tower?
6898000	6899000	Tiny Tower.
6899000	6900000	Oh, yeah.
6900000	6901000	That one for a bit.
6901000	6902000	That came up last week.
6902000	6904000	Did that come up on the show last week?
6904000	6906000	I was just talking about that game like a week ago.
6906000	6907000	Maybe.
6907000	6908000	Anyway.
6908000	6910000	There's been other games I'm sure we have...
6910000	6912000	Dance Sense Revolution.
6912000	6913000	Oh, yeah.
6913000	6914000	That might be one too.
6914000	6918000	People did kind of give us shit for President Cat even though we never actually played it
6918000	6919000	unless we were Loki.
6919000	6923000	Remember that totally fucking passive aggressive article some website wrote about the whole
6923000	6929000	President Cat campaign about like, well, internet campaigns don't usually translate into good
6929000	6930000	business sense.
6930000	6931000	And look at the President now.
6931000	6933000	Wouldn't you rather have a cat as the President?
6933000	6934000	I mean, come on.
6934000	6939000	A cat taking a shit would do a better job than the garbage we have now.
6941000	6947000	Mr. Smoosh, please sneeze so that you can do a better job than number 45.
6948000	6949000	Alright, anyway.
6949000	6952000	Thank you, President Smoosh.
6953000	6954000	That's the sequel.
6954000	6956000	President Cat followed by President Smoosh.
6956000	6957000	Loki, what about you?
6957000	6961000	Surely there's nothing you play that people give you shit for playing.
6961000	6963000	That your wife has ever given you shit for playing.
6963000	6964000	That's like everything.
6964000	6968000	There's nothing that my wife doesn't give me shit about enough.
6968000	6971000	We give Loki shit for never finishing his own game.
6971000	6972000	That's true.
6972000	6973000	And I haven't really worked on game development.
6973000	6975000	I've been thinking about working on game development.
6975000	6979000	That's been my conflict, but I just haven't done that.
6979000	6983000	I don't know.
6983000	6987000	I guess one game I like that not a lot of people like would be Earth Defense Force.
6987000	6988000	I like those games.
6988000	6992000	I mean, if you objectively look at them, they're kind of crap.
6992000	6994000	I don't know.
6994000	6999000	But people don't really give me crap about playing games.
6999000	7002000	I don't know.
7002000	7004000	Who would do that?
7004000	7008000	I just get crap for not making my own game.
7008000	7009000	Which, yeah, that's fair enough.
7009000	7011000	I have a legit answer for this.
7011000	7012000	A game that I get shit for liking.
7012000	7017000	Because everybody wants to shit on this game and call it one of the worst 8-bit games that they ever made.
7017000	7019000	I don't think this game is as bad as people say it is.
7019000	7021000	Friday the 13th.
7021000	7023000	I don't think it was a great game.
7023000	7024000	It wasn't great.
7024000	7028000	But I remember it was certainly one of the first games I remember having legit jump scares at.
7028000	7031000	When you're in that fucking house and you turn a corner and then
7031000	7032000	Bong, bong, bong, bong.
7032000	7035000	And fluorescent Jason, is there a way to cut a bitch?
7035000	7037000	That shit was scary.
7037000	7040000	I gave my friend Julie shit for liking Mylon's Secret Castle.
7040000	7044000	I fucking owned Mylon's Secret Castle. You apologized to Julie.
7044000	7048000	Well, no, it's just because I didn't like that there was no way to continue.
7048000	7054000	But I would have games that I would just sit and leave my Nintendo on all night and pray I didn't set the house on fire.
7054000	7057000	That's how you had to do it back in the day.
7057000	7060000	I used to do it too so my mom couldn't see it was on.
7060000	7063000	I would have a blanket over the Nintendo or something.
7063000	7066000	Because that'll make it less hot.
7066000	7070000	Yeah, but like when you're like nine, you're not critical.
7070000	7072000	I'd just prop up a cartridge in front of it.
7072000	7074000	Or a cutout of a box.
7074000	7076000	I don't remember those NES's getting that hot.
7076000	7079000	I remember it was at the pocket station.
7079000	7080000	You know, it had limited battery life.
7080000	7085000	But I think if you plugged it into your Playstation or whatever, it would still play itself.
7085000	7088000	And so I'd leave that in there overnight for days.
7088000	7090000	And then come back and have all these items.
7090000	7092000	People would give me shit about the money I would spend on games.
7092000	7094000	Thank you, Doomplague.
7094000	7096000	That game is underappreciated.
7096000	7100000	I mean, it's not a good game, but it was ahead of its time in some ways.
7100000	7101000	And Dark Tetsuya says,
7101000	7103000	Rygar, I tried to beat that in one sitting.
7103000	7107000	I remember staying up late with my uncle trying to get to the end in one go.
7107000	7108000	It always blew me away.
7108000	7111000	Like, how fucking different the NES Rygar and the arcade Rygar are.
7111000	7113000	They are like two completely different games.
7113000	7115000	It's like Strider.
7115000	7117000	Well, but you know Strider is based off of the manga.
7117000	7119000	One's the manga, one's the arcade.
7119000	7120000	Yeah.
7120000	7125000	But I think the biggest shit people would give me was for the money I spent on them.
7125000	7129000	The very first import game I ever bought, I paid $110 for.
7129000	7132000	And that was to get the Sailor Moon S fighting game.
7132000	7139000	That I learned how to mod my game genie so that I could do the chibi moon butt attack.
7139000	7145000	I'm gonna wait for the emails this week giving me shit about how much I confessed to spending on Pokemon Go this week.
7145000	7147000	Girl.
7147000	7153000	I spent $90 on the Rival Schools Evolution release that came out.
7153000	7155000	You remember that one?
7155000	7156000	I don't.
7156000	7157000	It had like the school life dating sim.
7157000	7160000	I just remember the Dreamcast game you owned with the fucking dish.
7160000	7161000	That blows me away.
7161000	7162000	Okay.
7162000	7163000	You bought a game with a dish.
7163000	7164000	And it wasn't even that great.
7164000	7169000	It was the Cardcaptor Sakura game and I thought it was gonna be like Pokemon Snap with Cardcaptor Sakura.
7169000	7172000	And it kind of was but it sucked.
7173000	7176000	Cuz you, oh crap, why can't I remember her name?
7176000	7177000	Her little friend.
7177000	7179000	The cute little girl that makes all of her costumes.
7179000	7181000	You're asking the wrong person.
7181000	7182000	Ugh.
7182000	7183000	I can't remember.
7183000	7184000	More of a Ranma question I would think.
7184000	7188000	S2100 Matt in chat says, uh, Dr. Seuss is Kuro?
7188000	7189000	No, not Kero-chan.
7189000	7192000	S2100 Matt says, I think people got a ton of shit for playing Runescape.
7192000	7193000	Tomoyo.
7193000	7194000	Back in the day.
7194000	7195000	Tomoyo.
7195000	7197000	Do you know how many people get shit for playing WoW?
7197000	7198000	Anyway.
7198000	7199000	I played Gemstone.
7199000	7200000	Gemstone 3.
7200000	7201000	But anyway.
7201000	7204000	Why don't you stop giving everybody shit and learn from your friends?
7204000	7205000	We have another email.
7205000	7206000	Oh, okay.
7206000	7209000	Um, this comes from Robert M.
7209000	7211000	Just seeing how you're doing.
7211000	7215000	I was taken by surprise Tuesday morning when Animal Crossing Pocket Camp launched.
7215000	7220000	I'm having frequent connection issues which are hopefully server side.
7220000	7221000	Launch window jitters.
7221000	7222000	Certainly having fun with it.
7222000	7224000	And yes, that should have been resolved by now.
7224000	7226000	I haven't had any disconnects.
7226000	7228000	Oh yeah, we actually, we never got around to it.
7228000	7232000	We never got around to it, but it was, uh, the link in the kickoff story was about those issues.
7232000	7238000	Nintendo did apologize for it and they changed the timing of some things and gave everybody 20 leaf tickets.
7238000	7239000	How about that?
7241000	7242000	Alright.
7242000	7244000	Woo! 20 tickets!
7244000	7246000	That'll buy you an extra storage slot.
7246000	7248000	Can you give us our virtual console?
7248000	7254000	Also, I see the Transformer site I follow has news on an upcoming crossover with Street Fighter.
7254000	7260000	Yes, these are exciting figure, uh, existing figures redecode as characters from the game.
7260000	7266000	A deluxe-sized two-pack of Generations RC is Chun-Li with Titan's return Hot Rod as Ken.
7266000	7275000	Then a Voyager set of, uh, TR Optimus Prime slash Convoy as Ryu versus, uh, TR Megatron as M. Bison's Las Vegas.
7275000	7279000	These are, from what I gathered, limited edition Japanese releases from Takara Tomy.
7279000	7284000	I looked at the Chun-Li and I'm like, shit, why didn't I buy an RC?
7284000	7290000	The only thing that I would really want would be another Hot Rod to add to my collection of 50 million other Hot Rods.
7290000	7295000	I think I have, like, three Rodimus Primes and seven Hot Rods from various collections.
7295000	7297000	So, it'd have to go to my collection.
7297000	7299000	And Dan would be like, oh, it's Ken, that's cool.
7299000	7307000	Um, P.S. I do sometimes pronounce the merch company as Ta-Takerotemi.
7307000	7310000	Okay, but Takara Tomy, anyway.
7310000	7315000	Um, like a surgical procedure, but only in jest.
7315000	7318000	We say silly things sometimes, like, don't we always call Squarey-
7318000	7324000	Oh, he's saying Ta-ka-rota-me, like it would be a surgical pr- that's funny, huh.
7324000	7325000	Takara-ta-me.
7325000	7326000	Takara-ta-me.
7326000	7327000	I don't know.
7327000	7328000	Ta-pa-ra-ma-nee. I don't know.
7328000	7336000	Um, I- I've probably spent a lot of money at HobbyLink Japan when I was in the height of my-
7336000	7339000	I need every single Hot Rod figure that's- I've got, like, a Canadian one, Ab-Japanese one-
7339000	7342000	Responsible income is awesome. I don't need to save.
7342000	7346000	Well, this- actually, I bought- my Hot Rod collection comes from spite.
7348000	7357000	Because, when I was a kid, my mother, and she'll deny it to this day, she's like, girls don't play with Transformers, I'll get you another Barbie.
7357000	7362000	Mother, I need to see Optimus Prime die, you don't understand.
7362000	7365000	You don't need to go see that boys movie.
7365000	7367000	So I snuck to go see it anyway.
7367000	7368000	Of course you did.
7368000	7369000	And I sobbed.
7369000	7372000	And then I was like, fucking A, Hot Rod's cool.
7372000	7379000	And that also kind of started my obsession with, um, uh, what's this fuck?
7379000	7382000	Great, now I can see him in the Breakfast Club and I can't think of his name.
7382000	7383000	Emilio Estevez?
7383000	7384000	No, not Emilio Estevez.
7384000	7385000	Judd Nelson?
7385000	7386000	Judd Nelson.
7386000	7387000	Judd Nelson was Hot Rod's voice.
7387000	7393000	Also, Orson- that was Orson Welles' last role was Unicron in that movie.
7393000	7394000	Leonard Nimoy-
7394000	7397000	I'm sorry, but that is just the quintessential Jamie growing up story.
7397000	7398000	Leonard Nimoy was in that too.
7398000	7399000	Yes, I did.
7399000	7400000	As Galvatron.
7400000	7401000	Yes.
7401000	7402000	But anyway, yes.
7402000	7407000	So I, as an adult, I had a whole shitload of Transformers and a bunch of Hot Rods.
7407000	7412000	I have, like, a couple of Starscreams and we have all the Binaltech- a lot of the Binaltech ones.
7413000	7418000	All my stuff- now, see, I was not, you know, don't bring your stereotypes into this because
7418000	7420000	I was not into Barbies or any of that stuff.
7420000	7425000	I was always into the very, like, Lego- I'm into all the stuff that Loki's into now.
7425000	7427000	That was the stuff I was into when I was a kid.
7427000	7429000	Legos, especially.
7429000	7431000	Uh, constructs.
7431000	7434000	Tinkertoys were the shit.
7434000	7440000	My grandma had- I don't know if you ever saw these, but she had Tinkertoys that were, like,
7440000	7441000	adult-sized Tinkertoys.
7441000	7442000	Oh, shit.
7442000	7443000	That's cool!
7443000	7448000	Like, they had, like, the largest polar they had was, like, a good four or five feet long.
7448000	7453000	And, like, the plast- like, the actual piece- the little round wood things that you plug
7453000	7459000	them into were, like, the size of, I don't know, like, a small wheelbarrow tire or something like that.
7459000	7460000	Oh, that's cool.
7460000	7462000	It was, like, we used to build, like, Fords out of that shit.
7462000	7467000	Or just use the large green pieces as, like, bow staffs because we pretended that it shows.
7467000	7468000	Do they still make Tinkertoys?
7468000	7469000	Or is that-
7469000	7470000	They have-
7470000	7471000	It's probably cheap-ass-
7471000	7472000	It's all plastic.
7472000	7473000	Fuck-ass plastic.
7473000	7474000	It's plastic shit.
7474000	7475000	No, no, no, no.
7475000	7477000	Tinkertoys are made of wood.
7477000	7481000	But, when I was a kid, though, I also really super-loved Lincoln Logs.
7481000	7487000	And I would combine my Lincoln Logs and Tinkertoys to make, like, this elaborate death trap for
7487000	7489000	all my Barbies.
7489000	7491000	I'll show you playing with Barbies.
7491000	7494000	Do you wanna play a game?
7494000	7498000	And no one- and no one could come in my room because these labyrinths would spawn-
7498000	7501000	The minute the door opened, an elaborate death trap would behead Barbie.
7501000	7502000	Up on the bed.
7502000	7507000	And, finally, I think just, like, they got, you know, broken and thrown away because I
7507000	7510000	kept, you know, making it unsafe to navigate my bedroom.
7510000	7514000	But my all-time favorite was Domino Rally.
7514000	7516000	Yes, yes, yes.
7516000	7517000	They sell that now.
7517000	7518000	They do.
7518000	7520000	Dirt is dirt fucking cheap.
7520000	7521000	I almost bought it.
7521000	7524000	And I was like, Rob, you don't have kids.
7524000	7525000	You know what else is-
7525000	7526000	Who cares?
7526000	7527000	Who cares?
7527000	7528000	What else is also cheap?
7528000	7533000	Like, I remember, like, back when I had, like, uh, K'Nex or whatever, and I only really had
7533000	7537000	one set of that, but, like, I remember the K'Nex roller coasters were, like, so fucking,
7537000	7538000	like, expensive and elaborate.
7538000	7540000	Now they're so cheap.
7540000	7543000	And Mouse Trap was the best board game ever.
7543000	7544000	Yeah, that was pretty fun.
7544000	7545000	Yeah.
7545000	7546000	Anyway.
7546000	7547000	Alright.
7547000	7548000	Uh.
7548000	7549000	That's it for emails.
7549000	7550000	That's it for emails.
7550000	7552000	Boy, did we get on some tangents with those emails tonight.
7552000	7553000	Okay.
7553000	7557000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you wanna send this show into a Barbie death trap
7557000	7558000	spiral.
7558000	7560000	In the meantime-
7560000	7563000	I was just an imaginative, creative child.
7563000	7564000	Yes you were.
7564000	7565000	Yes you were.
7565000	7568000	Alright, let's get into some other gaming news.
7568000	7571000	Speaking of robots, right, Loki?
7571000	7572000	Yes.
7572000	7578000	Ironically enough, I am looking at a picture of a robot, but, um, not anything to do with
7578000	7579000	this article.
7579000	7583000	So, um, Valve is changing the way their review system works.
7583000	7589000	The stop from, um, having bots basically manipulate that system.
7589000	7595000	So, they've, I guess, having a problem with, I guess, um, bot brigade- bot brigading on
7595000	7597000	certain games.
7597000	7601000	And, um, including, I guess, anti-review bomb charts and stuff like that that they've added,
7601000	7603000	um, in recent updates.
7603000	7607000	But now they're kind of trying to do some additional stuff with that.
7607000	7611000	First, of course, they've acknowledged saying that, you know, basically that there's a small
7611000	7618000	group to manipulate reviews to a degree that is clearly decreasing the value of Steam for
7618000	7619000	many other players.
7619000	7621000	And to solve this problem, they're doing a couple things.
7621000	7626000	First, the helpful ratings from the accounts, um, that are far outside the norm will be
7626000	7630000	weighed differently than those of regular, presumably human users.
7630000	7636000	Accounts that rate an excessive number of reviews on games will see the weight of each
7636000	7640000	review rating count for less and less.
7640000	7646000	Um, that's kind of lame if they- if there's someone that's actually reviewing games.
7646000	7651000	I would think that- can you review games that you don't buy on Steam?
7651000	7655000	I think you used to be able to, but not anymore.
7655000	7661000	If you're gifted the code, then it actually puts a disclaimer by your little review that says
7661000	7664000	a code was provided by the publisher or something like that.
7664000	7666000	So that whole like disclaimer is up front.
7666000	7670000	I don't believe you can review a game that you haven't played because it also shows right
7670000	7673000	underneath it how many hours you've put into the game.
7673000	7674000	True.
7674000	7675000	Let me ask this question.
7675000	7678000	I just want to ask this general question of our chat room.
7678000	7685000	Have you ever been influenced on buying a video game or not based on like user reviews
7685000	7686000	on Steam?
7686000	7687000	Have you really?
7687000	7691000	Well, yeah, because like, especially like if I'm looking to purchase a game and I see
7691000	7694000	a bunch of negative reviews for it and I start reading them and it's like, oh yeah,
7694000	7699000	the DRM is causing issues of the game or blah, blah, blah is causing issues of the game.
7699000	7707000	Like for example, South Park, you know, of this fractured butthole on PC is kind of broken,
7707000	7710000	I think, unless they've patched that recently.
7710000	7714000	But it came out kind of broken because of the DRM in there and is buggy.
7714000	7717000	And so that's one of the reasons I guess I didn't purchase it on Steam.
7717000	7722000	But it's good to know those kind of things are like, you know, other issues where, you
7722000	7726000	know, the performance might not be as good or especially games I'm not familiar with
7726000	7728000	and I may see something like, oh, that looks really cool.
7728000	7733000	And I read the reviews and there's usually I read more like in depth to see what they're
7733000	7736000	trying to say and see if there's a common consensus across them.
7736000	7739000	If it's just like, all right, fucking hate this.
7739000	7741000	You know, there's a lot of people that will just hate on anything.
7741000	7743000	So it's hard to say.
7743000	7744000	Let's see.
7744000	7745000	Comments from chat.
7745000	7748000	SSG100Matt says, sounds like this is mostly to curb downvote protests.
7748000	7750000	Oh, for sure.
7750000	7751000	Absolutely.
7751000	7756000	Other comments from chat asking or answering my question about, do you get swayed by these?
7756000	7757000	I'm actually kind of surprised.
7757000	7759000	It sounds like most people are saying yes.
7759000	7761000	JD says, yeah, sometimes.
7761000	7767000	MegaManX400 says, if the user reviews are overwhelmingly poor, then yes.
7767000	7771000	Fifth Dream says, yes, if people say it's technically shit or really, really crappy.
7771000	7776000	MXC says, I'll look at Steam reviews to gauge how long a game is.
7776000	7781000	Don't have time for a lot of super long stuff, so I generally seek out shorter titles.
7781000	7782000	Interesting.
7782000	7786000	SquatchKilla says, I use reviews on new games mostly.
7786000	7790000	If they get bad reviews, I might buy them later discounted.
7790000	7796000	So weighing if this is a buy it now or wait for a Steam sale sort of situation.
7796000	7800000	So, wow, I guess I'm different in that regard.
7800000	7805000	I will use user reviews like friends on Twitter, people I know,
7805000	7810000	but I tend not to let randos on Steam influence my decision
7810000	7813000	because I know all these fucking campaigns are run all the time.
7813000	7814000	Right.
7814000	7819000	I was actually kind of surprised to see a lot of you do use that.
7819000	7821000	Now I feel weird.
7821000	7824000	Well, why do you feel weird about it?
7824000	7825000	No, I don't know.
7825000	7829000	I thought everybody kind of took the Yelp approach to Steam
7829000	7832000	where it's like, oh, you're only ever going to read the bad stuff.
7832000	7834000	That's how Yelp is to me.
7834000	7837000	Like you either somebody went to Yelp because they're like,
7837000	7840000	no, I have 300 friends on my Facebook.
7840000	7842000	I'm going to slander your company to me and, you know,
7842000	7846000	write something negative on Facebook or Yelp or whatever.
7846000	7850000	Or it's the fucking owner's friend and they wrote a five star review.
7850000	7854000	Like you very rarely find the honest shit in between on those sites.
7854000	7858000	So like I don't pay attention to a lot of those, that stuff.
7858000	7861000	And so I kind of have that attitude with video games.
7861000	7864000	I'm like everything is either a hundred percent or zero percent
7864000	7867000	and it's never truly in between.
7867000	7868000	But again, it's personal.
7868000	7871000	I'm not, you know, that's why I asked the question.
7871000	7873000	I wanted to see what you guys kind of did with that.
7873000	7876000	So let's see.
7876000	7880000	Oh, SSU100Matt in chat says, I wrote a negative Yelp review on a mechanic
7880000	7883000	and I got bribed to take it down by the shop.
7883000	7888000	See, I use Yelp to find places that are open
7888000	7890000	because they have business hours listed in there.
7890000	7892000	That's the most I use Yelp for.
7892000	7893000	I don't read reviews anymore.
7893000	7895000	There's too much fuckery that goes on.
7895000	7899000	Well, not always because like my wife left a negative Yelp review yesterday
7899000	7901000	for Chinese places that we went to.
7901000	7904000	And she looked at it, you know, because I guess the food,
7904000	7907000	we've been there before and the food's been good.
7907000	7912000	And then lately she got it and like they were skimping on all the like meat
7912000	7916000	and then the like shrimp that she took a bite of the shrimp in the soup.
7916000	7918000	She's like, ah, that shrimp is not good, you know?
7918000	7922000	And she called up to let them know, hey, your shrimp is probably bad.
7922000	7925000	They no apology, not even concerned.
7925000	7928000	They're just like me and just like kind of brushed her off.
7928000	7930000	And she's like, well, I'm going to leave a review then.
7930000	7934000	And like last six months, there's been a ton of negative reviews from place
7934000	7936000	probably because it's like on our new ownership or something.
7936000	7938000	So it's good to kind of gauge it.
7938000	7940000	But yeah, I mean, people were only right views
7940000	7942000	if they have something negative to say for the most part.
7942000	7943000	I mean, so I don't know.
7943000	7945000	So I always take that stuff with a grain of salt.
7945000	7946000	That's just, that's just me.
7946000	7948000	Anyway, uh, let's move on.
7948000	7952000	As Joe and Matt wanted to make it clear, I didn't take the bait.
7952000	7954000	All right. All right. All right.
7954000	7955000	Let's move on.
7955000	7958000	Oh, hey, I actually have news to talk about in Pokemon Go,
7958000	7960000	even though I think we've kind of already addressed this.
7960000	7963000	But if you didn't know, there was this big event going on in Pokemon Go
7963000	7968000	called the Global Catch Challenge, where basically Niantic was daring you
7968000	7971000	to catch 3 billion Pokemon in a week.
7971000	7974000	And did they do it? Yes, they did.
7974000	7978000	So the players of Pokemon Go did catch 3 billion Pokemon,
7978000	7984000	which unlocked Double XP, Double Stardust for, I think, till December 1st.
7984000	7991000	And the biggest one of all, Farfetch'd, the bird that's carrying the leak,
7991000	7995000	has been unleashed worldwide for 48 hours.
7995000	7999000	So that means you have about 24 more hours to catch a Farfetch'd
7999000	8000000	if you haven't already got one.
8000000	8003000	And they, they have been spawning on my house.
8003000	8005000	So maybe I'm checking right now. Yeah.
8005000	8007000	Yeah. I checked my house.
8007000	8010000	I'm not going to go out to try to catch one, but you know.
8010000	8012000	But if you do, you only have 24 more hours to do it.
8012000	8015000	But they're, they're not, at least I know I'm not sleeping.
8015000	8017000	They're not terribly hard to find.
8017000	8021000	Like they are, they're spawning about as common as, as the, uh,
8022000	8026000	Shuppets on like those dust skulls were fucking everywhere.
8026000	8029000	The Shuppets were plentiful, but not everywhere.
8029000	8030000	That's kind of where Farfetch'd is at.
8030000	8031000	I just caught a Pikachu.
8031000	8033000	Well, Pikachu spawn on my house all the time.
8033000	8034000	I don't know why.
8034000	8036000	He's on a Pikachu nest.
8036000	8038000	No, but it's not even a nest because nests rotate.
8038000	8039000	Right.
8039000	8040000	So I don't know what it is.
8040000	8042000	They must know that nerds live here.
8042000	8043000	So we get Pikachu all the time.
8043000	8045000	So there you go.
8045000	8049000	Maybe that's my reward for playing so much fucking Ingress in Pokemon Go.
8049000	8050000	Niantic knows me personally.
8051000	8052000	And puts Pikachu on my house.
8052000	8053000	That's my little.
8053000	8055000	This is Rob's house and we're going to put all the Pikas there.
8055000	8058000	If that's good, how about a fucking shiny Pikachu then?
8058000	8060000	Cause that's the one thing I don't have.
8060000	8061000	Are there shinies?
8061000	8065000	Yeah, they have like a gray thing on their tail instead of it being like black.
8065000	8066000	Very few.
8066000	8070000	Uh, Pikachu has a shiny in Pokemon Go.
8070000	8071000	That is in the regular series.
8071000	8073000	Obviously most everything does with some exceptions.
8073000	8078000	Uh, in Pokemon Go, the gen three Halloween all have shinies.
8078000	8082000	So, Shuppet, Duskull, and, um, Sableye.
8082000	8084000	Uh, Pikachu has a shiny.
8084000	8086000	Magikarp has a shiny.
8086000	8087000	I think that's it.
8087000	8089000	I feel like there might be one other I'm forgetting.
8089000	8091000	But those are all the shinies that exist in the game right now.
8091000	8092000	So.
8092000	8093000	Alright.
8093000	8095000	Uh, but there you go.
8095000	8096000	So Farfetch'd was unlocked.
8096000	8104000	And, um, oh, it wasn't just Farfetch'd because now if you lived in East Asia, Japan,
8104000	8111000	where Farfetch'd was your local Pokemon, you'd feel pretty screwed that the whole world got, you know, your Pokemon.
8111000	8116000	Well, they got Kangaskhan in exchange, which was the Australia exclusive.
8116000	8120000	So, they, Asia got some of this too so that they got something that was new to them.
8120000	8121000	So, there you go.
8121000	8128000	Although, if you were lucky enough to be in Anaheim for Pokemon Worlds, you may also have a Kangaskhan living in the US.
8128000	8132000	So, the only one that has not been released in the US at this point is Mr. Mime.
8132000	8134000	So, we'll see.
8135000	8136000	Alright.
8136000	8137000	Mr. Mime!
8137000	8138000	Okay.
8138000	8139000	Not Mr. Smoosh, but Mr. Mime.
8139000	8140000	Mr. Smoosh is cuter.
8140000	8141000	That's right.
8141000	8142000	Mr. Smoosh is way cuter and so-
8142000	8144000	We like his little face.
8144000	8150000	A few more stories before we open up the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
8150000	8155000	If you have the Skype app, you can just add Orange Lounge Radio and give us a call in a little bit.
8155000	8158000	Or, of course, the desktop version works too.
8158000	8162000	And I think it's like fucking built into Windows 10, isn't it, so everybody has Skype.
8162000	8163000	Yes.
8163000	8164000	You can't really-
8164000	8165000	Guess who's not on Windows?
8165000	8166000	Your Xbox has it.
8166000	8167000	Sorry.
8167000	8168000	I meant to set up the laptop.
8168000	8169000	I haven't forgotten.
8169000	8170000	I just-
8170000	8172000	That actually wasn't a read on that whole thing.
8172000	8173000	I forgot about that too.
8173000	8174000	I know.
8174000	8175000	Alright.
8175000	8176000	Anyhow.
8176000	8177000	Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?
8177000	8180000	Number one, people need to stop posting articles about cookie butter.
8180000	8184000	Did you know that that's like the Oreo flavor right now is cookie butter Oreos?
8184000	8185000	What?
8185000	8187000	It's a cookie already.
8187000	8188000	You don't need cookie butter.
8188000	8191000	No, cookie butter is fucking magical.
8191000	8195000	My favorite was when Oreo had the cookies and cream flavored Oreo.
8195000	8198000	I was like, did they feed the cow beef?
8198000	8201000	It's meta Oreo.
8201000	8202000	Anyway.
8202000	8203000	I heard you like Oreos.
8203000	8205000	Here's your Oreo in your Oreo.
8205000	8207000	This is why I love our chat room.
8207000	8208000	Like I said earlier in the show-
8208000	8210000	Did anyone buy any Prongles during the break?
8210000	8212000	Once you pop, that's great.
8212000	8213000	No.
8213000	8215000	So, this is why I love our chatters.
8215000	8219000	Even though I said earlier in the show, we'll never be famous, but we have a great turnout here.
8219000	8223000	Is because everybody's like, oh no, cookie butter is serious shit.
8223000	8225000	Cookie butter is the shit.
8225000	8228000	And fifth dream ask, is cookie butter a white person thing?
8228000	8229000	I don't know.
8229000	8233000	Cookie butter has been out in Europe for quite a while.
8233000	8234000	It's from Belgium.
8234000	8241000	It's called Speculoos along with our, what was the other thing from Belgium that we had?
8241000	8243000	The Stroke Waffle.
8244000	8250000	But it's basically just this buttery, delicious cookie paste.
8250000	8252000	By the way, can we talk about Stroke Waffle for a minute?
8252000	8254000	Stroke Waffle.
8254000	8257000	Because, yeah, I know I mispronounced it, but I don't care.
8257000	8263000	I opened the mail this week and I have a big envelope in the mail and it's kind of thick.
8263000	8265000	I'm like, what the hell did somebody send me in the mail?
8265000	8269000	And it's from Ranma, our good pal Ranma who calls into the show frequently.
8269000	8271000	And I'm like, what the hell is this?
8271000	8275000	And so I open it up, I open up the first envelope, there's another envelope inside it.
8275000	8279000	And I'm like, I swear to God, this is one of the things where you keep like, it's like the Russian dolls.
8279000	8283000	You keep opening the box and I get to the middle and there's just a middle finger printed out on it.
8283000	8286000	I'm gonna be so mad. I'm gonna fly out to New York and beat him up.
8286000	8288000	But it was a much better ending.
8288000	8296000	So inside the second envelope were tiny little miniature Stroke Waffles that I think he got in, still in the wrapper,
8296000	8299000	that I think he got at some anime convention or someplace that he was at.
8299000	8302000	He fucking mailed me Stroke Waffles.
8302000	8305000	And again, this is why I love our listeners, especially Ranma.
8305000	8311000	Well, I told you my friend in Belgium who I met through Dragon Age fan fiction.
8311000	8316000	We did a food exchange. I sent her Pop-Tarts and she sent me like the packaged sugar waffles.
8316000	8320000	That's what they fucking want in Europe and Netherlands and everything on the other side of the pond.
8320000	8322000	They want the fucking Pop-Tarts.
8322000	8325000	I sent like Orange Crush Pop-Tarts.
8325000	8327000	Well, yeah, because they don't have anything but like strawberry and blueberry.
8327000	8329000	We have all the weird shit.
8329000	8331000	I basically sent a gift of diabetes.
8331000	8333000	Anyway.
8333000	8335000	So, story.
8335000	8337000	Oh, yes. Where were we?
8337000	8339000	Super Nintendo World!
8339000	8343000	So there's a few more details for Universal Studios in Florida.
8343000	8348000	The area for the Super Nintendo World is going to be 8.8 acres in size
8348000	8354000	and will be built behind Simpsons Land in where currently the kid zone is.
8354000	8356000	The E.T. ride will stay there.
8356000	8359000	There will be 48 toilets in total.
8359000	8361000	It will take about 3 years to build.
8361000	8368000	And it will be open sometime just after Japan's Universal Studios Nintendo Park opens.
8368000	8373000	There are sections mentioned for Donkey Kong and Mario Kart.
8373000	8377000	Both of which will be in both parks.
8378000	8380000	So, um.
8380000	8382000	Yes, act deft.
8382000	8385000	I still would like some Not Nutella Oreos again, please.
8385000	8387000	Theme park.
8387000	8390000	I'm not going to be able to eat this stuff before too long.
8390000	8391000	I know.
8391000	8393000	Sad face.
8393000	8395000	Give me all the candy!
8395000	8400000	So there was also a Twitter post by Chip Scambis.
8400000	8404000	Who, um, I don't know where he factors into it.
8404000	8406000	Maybe he is.
8406000	8409000	He is a designer at Universal.
8409000	8418000	And he was saying that they are going to do a dining area with a total seating capacity of 365 seats as well.
8418000	8420000	What kind of Nintendo food?
8420000	8422000	Are they going to bring back Nintendo cereal?
8422000	8426000	I'm fucking there if I can go buy Nintendo cereal at one of the food carts.
8426000	8428000	What if we have conga churros?
8428000	8429000	What if...
8429000	8432000	What if they did banana lumpia?
8432000	8439000	What if they did those milkshakes, but instead of Froot Loops or whatever, they put Nintendo cereal in it?
8439000	8443000	Or what if they have Star Cupcakes?
8443000	8445000	But no, what if they just did banana milkshakes?
8445000	8446000	Anyway.
8446000	8448000	Donkey Kong banana milkshakes.
8448000	8450000	Banana milkshakes are the fucking best.
8450000	8453000	It doesn't matter what we talk about. It just evolves into food.
8453000	8455000	But those maple cookies were good.
8455000	8456000	Yes, they were.
8456000	8458000	Okay. That's it.
8458000	8460000	Well, when are they going to...
8460000	8463000	When are they going to, excuse me, open this place? I want to go.
8463000	8465000	I didn't find that.
8465000	8467000	They said it was a few years.
8467000	8469000	They said it should take about three years to construct.
8469000	8471000	Don't die, please.
8471000	8475000	I think the last thing I read was Japan is supposed to have theirs just before the Olympics in 2020.
8475000	8479000	And then everybody else gets theirs shortly after, so that wouldn't surprise me.
8479000	8480000	Yeah.
8482000	8483000	Don't die, Rob.
8483000	8486000	Just a few more stories and then we'll get to the Skype line. Loki.
8486000	8491000	Alright. So apparently, there's more Kickstarter shenanigans.
8491000	8495000	So there's a developer of this game called Project Phoenix.
8495000	8504000	I guess the director of that is being accused of embezzling one million dollars from the Kickstarter campaign.
8504000	8510000	So apparently, yes, it starts off with the game developer, Tariq Lacy,
8510000	8522000	has accused the director, Hiroaki Yura, of stealing money from the Kickstarter of Project Phoenix to fund his latest game, Tiny Metal.
8522000	8527000	And basically saying that the...
8527000	8539000	And of course, Yura is making his own allegations saying that, you know, Lacy is accusing Lacy of sexual harassment, which of course they deny.
8539000	8542000	And it's basically back and forth and that type of thing.
8542000	8547000	So there is... I guess this has been quite a long project.
8547000	8550000	It first popped up in 2013.
8550000	8561000	And I guess since then, you know, it's raised over one million dollars from about 15... almost 16,000 backers.
8561000	8566000	And then 2015, so the game would be delayed for another three years.
8566000	8571000	And in April 2017, told the backers that he planned to release a different game first.
8571000	8579000	He explained that he had found some investors who would be willing to help back Project Phoenix if his new game succeeded.
8579000	8586000	And that new game was Tiny Metal, which I guess is scheduled to release December 21st.
8586000	8592000	And now, of course, you know, it just seems like this stuff keeps getting pushed back and pushed back.
8592000	8600000	So he went and turned to Facebook to basically kind of accuse Yura's company of running a scam.
8600000	8609000	So basically said, two months after I was hired to Area 35, I had learned that the company funded this project by running a scam through Kickstarter.
8609000	8619000	They gathered several famous creators and ran a campaign known as Project Phoenix, then used the one million dollars received from the campaign to fund Tiny Metal project.
8619000	8628000	Here's how it happened. After they received the Kickstarter money for Project Phoenix, they shut down the original company, Creative Intelligent Arts, or CIA,
8628000	8635000	and then used the same money to establish Area 35 and pay for staff equipment and the office to make Tiny Metal.
8635000	8647000	And I guess the company's CEO asked me to deflect any accusations that this money was from any other companies or other than private investors.
8647000	8661000	In actuality, Hiroaki only dipped into his own funds and asked for money from private investors after funding what he had secured for Tiny Metal was running low.
8661000	8665000	I don't know. This is kind of why I stay away from Kickstarter.
8665000	8671000	This is why, yeah, I'm kind of like over Kickstarter at this point, which is a bummer because there's a lot of people out there that are using it legitimately.
8671000	8679000	But there's just, there's too much fuckery going. This is the theme of the night, fuckery. There's too much fuckery going on on Kickstarter, kind of like this stuff.
8679000	8692000	I want to just quickly say dungeonbuster in our chat at live.fognetwork.com says, just for context, Divinity Original Sin and its sequel have been released in the time Project Phoenix Kickstarter started, ended, and ran into problems, and is still not done.
8692000	8697000	I'm still waiting for blood-stained ritual tonight.
8697000	8700000	True, but we at least have seen something playable of that.
8700000	8706000	Yeah, and I know I'm not going to get swindled on that, but it's like, you know, we sometimes forget when we back these Kickstarters.
8706000	8710000	It takes a long fucking time to make a video game, don't it, Loki?
8710000	8713000	Well, it helps if you're actually working on the game.
8713000	8715000	It sure does, yes.
8715000	8720000	It sure does. Or know which game you're actually working on because, you know, there's that too.
8720000	8724000	Anyway, we're about to open up the Skype line. Give us a call if you want.
8724000	8731000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, and you can talk to us about anything we've talked about tonight, or maybe you have something different.
8731000	8734000	While we wait for some calls to come in, I got one more story for you guys here.
8734000	8739000	Oh god, it's another loot box story, but this one is very tongue-in-cheek. I like this.
8739000	8748000	It's a mod for the original Doom that turns it into Doom with loot boxes.
8748000	8752000	It's a tongue-in-cheek third-party mod that makes some adjustments to gameplay.
8752000	8757000	It removes weapons and power-ups on the map, and you get a UAC crate instead.
8757000	8766000	To open the crate, you need a key, which you have a chance of obtaining randomly with every enemy kill, or, of course, you can go into the shop and buy keys.
8766000	8774000	Although, since the whole thing is a joke, it just says the servers are down if you try to actually buy any particular key, and that's it.
8774000	8786000	So, there you go. So, with the keys that you can find, rarely you might get a shotgun, but you probably won't get that rocket launcher or BFG or the stuff you really need to beat Doom.
8786000	8792000	Anyway, there's a popular YouTube video showing this off out there by a user from ZDoomForums.
8792000	8800000	The username is stronkytonky is the user that put out this YouTube video where you can see him just get really frustrated at this.
8800000	8804000	He does finally find 10 keys after 600 kills.
8804000	8810000	Anyway, obviously the whole thing is supposed to be very tongue-in-cheek and a parody of the whole loot box thing, but it does kind of make you wonder,
8810000	8815000	God, where could this industry be right now if people had figured this out a while ago?
8815000	8826000	I guess we should be thankful that the 14.4K modem speeds we had back in the day that Doom was released, probably not fast enough to run loot boxes.
8827000	8830000	Well, here's the other thing, too, since we're talking about loot boxes.
8830000	8836000	So, there was an article that was on Polygon talking about Battlefront 2, and so what's going on with Battlefront 2 now?
8836000	8839000	People are AFK grinding this stuff, and so they're doing-
8839000	8841000	Oh, yeah, so somebody built like a contraption.
8841000	8849000	Yeah, there's a few things. So, there's someone that built it like a robot to kind of push buttons and move the stick and stuff like that randomly.
8849000	8857000	And then there's just people that are using rubber bands to move the analog sticks so that they run around in a circle or something like that.
8857000	8869000	And so, yeah, that's got to hurt the game as well because now people are basically just doing that, and you're getting in games with people that are AFK, and so that kind of sucks.
8869000	8873000	So, of course people are going to cheat the system like that because they feel it's unfair.
8873000	8883000	Well, and now, I mean, for better or for worse, depending on your opinions on this whole thing, Battlefront 2 has become like the kick box.
8883000	8884000	The dead horse?
8884000	8888000	Yeah, just the thing that everybody just beats up on as the symbol of-
8888000	8889000	The scapegoat.
8889000	8892000	Yeah, the scapegoat. The goat simulator.
8892000	8893000	Hey, goat simulator is awesome.
8893000	8901000	No, yeah, goat simulator is awesome, but I think of some of those scenes of goat simulator with the goat flinging through the air with those rubber band physics and stuff.
8901000	8909000	That's what EA's Battlefront game has become with this whole loot box thing is it's now everybody's kicking boy or whatever. What do they call it? Kicking dog? I don't know.
8909000	8910000	Whipping boy.
8910000	8917000	Whipping boy. That's it. Whipping boy is what this game has become. So, I mean, of course everybody's going to try to exploit it.
8917000	8926000	If you want to exploit our Skype line, OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word, you can give us a call right now. I'll check in with Loki, see if he has any other last minute stories.
8926000	8927000	This was kind of a slower news week.
8927000	8929000	Yeah, I don't.
8929000	8931000	I'm kind of surprised we filled the show.
8931000	8938000	There's all the different sales. I didn't pick anything up on the Steam sales, although I was tempted to, but I've already bought enough games recently.
8938000	8950000	This is the first year I'm like, or the first sale. I'm not really motivated to finish the badge either. Like you have to go in and nominate a game in any, every category and they're meaningless awards. And I'm just like, eh.
8950000	8953000	I picked up a couple, but I forgot what I got.
8953000	8957000	I haven't bought anything. I don't know. I need to go back and look at the list.
8957000	8960000	Ooh, I got picked for a Valve hardware survey. Ooh.
8960000	8962000	Are they going to send you a free Steam box?
8962000	8964000	Probably not. I already have one.
8964000	8967000	They started, they practically started giving those things away at some point.
8968000	8971000	I paid five for mine. Yeah.
8971000	8972000	I got mine for a dollar.
8972000	8973000	I don't want to tell you how much I paid for mine.
8973000	8975000	I'd buy that for a dollar and I did.
8975000	8977000	I got you your controller.
8977000	8985000	I know. Yes, but I love the controller. The controller has that whole haptic feedback thing, which is in this phone too. And I love it.
8985000	8986000	It's been in my phone for an age.
8986000	8987000	Well, wait.
8987000	8989000	It came out with a 6s.
8989000	8990000	With a 6s.
8991000	8999000	But the controller I have for my Apple TV, though, is crap. Now I can't think of what it's called either.
8999000	9006000	But it's a really good controller and I want to see if it'll work with our Steam link because I have a few games on there that I want to start playing now.
9006000	9007000	That'll be fun.
9007000	9008000	I'll have to look up what I have.
9008000	9017000	Yeah, I haven't got a chance to hook up my Steam link yet. Maybe I'll leave that this week because I was going to use it now for media streaming since we have in our little box.
9017000	9026000	My wife was teasing me this week. She was like, oh, we can go get a 4K TV this week if you want. I'm like, okay.
9026000	9031000	Well, the ones she was looking at really cheap. I was like, it needs to have HDR and all that stuff.
9031000	9036000	And I'm like, man, if we get a 4K TV, then I've got to get PlayStation Pro and stuff like that.
9036000	9038000	I don't want to spend that money.
9040000	9043000	By the way, I have the SteelSeries Nimbus wireless gaming controller.
9043000	9046000	I also have a SteelSeries controller.
9046000	9047000	It is fairly comfortable.
9047000	9048000	I do not.
9048000	9049000	When do I get mine?
9049000	9051000	Well, they're basically like an Xbox 360 controller.
9051000	9052000	That's cool.
9052000	9057000	But I think it feels a lot better put together. It's got a bit more heft in the hand, you know?
9057000	9058000	Yes.
9060000	9065000	Well, gosh, some folks in chat are talking about should be doing a live stream of the Doom loot box thing.
9065000	9068000	I wish I'd thought of that before the show. That would've been a fun live stream to do tonight.
9068000	9070000	I am going to do a live stream after the show tonight.
9070000	9073000	I'm going to do my first time playing.
9073000	9076000	I bought it earlier today because I knew I would buy it eventually.
9076000	9082000	My first time playing Rocket League on Switch, which for those counting, this is now the third time.
9082000	9084000	No, actually, I take that back.
9084000	9086000	It's only the first time I've bought it.
9086000	9091000	It's the third version I own, but it's the first time I've bought it because it was free on PlayStation Plus.
9091000	9094000	It was gifted to me on Steam, so I bought it on Switch.
9095000	9098000	So, yeah, I'm going to check out Rocket League after the show.
9098000	9103000	So you can check that out on my Twitch channel over at Rob Roberts.
9103000	9109000	I bought another $4 Switch game, too, and I might get into playing that as well.
9109000	9112000	So we'll see. We'll do that.
9112000	9116000	My kids, by the way, created their own YouTube channel.
9116000	9119000	Did they really? Let me just put one more call for calls.
9119000	9122000	I don't know if the Skype line is broken. I don't see anybody in chat complaining.
9122000	9124000	But Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
9124000	9126000	I'm getting set up to start vlogging.
9126000	9130000	See, that blows my mind because you haven't wanted to do video.
9130000	9133000	Because I can adjust the camera angle on my own vlog.
9133000	9137000	I will put the camera. You can do whatever you want with it here.
9137000	9138000	We'll see.
9138000	9139000	All right. Okay.
9139000	9147000	But I have a plan for how I want to do it, so it's basically things will happen.
9147000	9156000	You totally need to go the route of Gendo, where he's just sitting there with the silhouette and the shine on his glasses.
9156000	9158000	That's the way you need to do it.
9158000	9159000	I could do that.
9159000	9161000	It's Gendo.
9164000	9167000	All right. Well, our Skype line is not lighting up tonight.
9167000	9172000	I think we might. I mean, I don't check live listener numbers because I don't obsess over things like that anymore.
9172000	9177000	But I could look at people that are checking in over at the Voice Geeks Network at vognetwork.com.
9177000	9183000	Because we have a system, kind of like Foursquare used to be, where you can actually check into shows and you get points.
9183000	9186000	And you even get loot, not loot boxes, but loot.
9186000	9189000	Just fun things for your vog network profile and stuff.
9189000	9194000	And so I see, actually, we have more people checked in tonight than our last episode.
9194000	9198000	But not as many as two weeks ago, or two shows ago.
9198000	9200000	Did you know this?
9200000	9202000	I would assume the holiday weekend where I just have a lower turnout.
9202000	9206000	Did you know that Nier Automata is one of the games on the Steam sale right now?
9206000	9207000	40% off?
9207000	9208000	How much then?
9208000	9210000	That makes it $35.99.
9210000	9212000	I hear a lot of good things about that game.
9212000	9214000	I'm considering it, but I just had my hair done.
9214000	9216000	That's like Game of the Year level game.
9216000	9220000	But Okami HD is also $20. It's not on sale, but it's just $20.
9220000	9223000	There's another game, though, that's been kind of catching my interest.
9224000	9228000	And I'm sure it's just pronounced Valhalla, but it's VA11 Hall A.
9228000	9231000	Cyberpunk Bartender Action.
9231000	9235000	The ROM 2064 guys support that a lot.
9235000	9238000	Yeah, I've been considering getting that one.
9238000	9241000	So if anyone's playing it, let me know what you think of it.
9241000	9246000	Apparently I was looking at a page called Deep Space Waifu on Steam.
9246000	9249000	I don't remember, I saw a link to that, but it's like 99 cents.
9249000	9252000	And it kind of looks like it's a SHMUP game.
9252000	9257000	It's like a SHMUP game with anime babes or something.
9257000	9258000	Of course, because why not?
9258000	9261000	I'm not really sure what the point of that is, but it looks silly.
9261000	9262000	In cyanide sense.
9262000	9265000	SquatchKilla in chat over at live.voggenetwork.com says,
9265000	9269000	My son keeps asking to start a YouTube channel with myself.
9269000	9273000	You know, hey, some people make a lot of money doing that stuff.
9273000	9275000	Actually, should I say that?
9275000	9276000	Ok, I'm going to say it.
9276000	9282000	I have made my first threshold on Twitch where I'm getting a check.
9282000	9283000	Huzzah!
9283000	9286000	Yeah, I don't think I see it till next month.
9286000	9289000	Which I have not been doing a lot of streaming lately.
9289000	9291000	I was doing a lot of it when I was pushing first affiliate.
9291000	9293000	I've really scaled back and I apologize to you guys.
9293000	9299000	You guys just know I've had a really rough year and it's just hard for me to be extroverted several times throughout the week.
9299000	9301000	And I think most of you guys kind of know that and I really appreciate it.
9301000	9306000	I just feel like, oh god, I wish I could pull my shit together and do that more for the subscribers that I have.
9306000	9308000	But it's hard.
9308000	9310000	I would love to do that.
9310000	9312000	I don't have a place to do that.
9312000	9314000	I don't have the gear to do that.
9314000	9323000	And going back to place to do that, I don't have a place that I can talk with where the sound isn't going to bother my wife.
9323000	9326000	Or wake up my kids because it would have to be when they were asleep.
9326000	9328000	Unless they're going to do stuff on it.
9328000	9331000	We just don't have any room in the house to do that.
9331000	9335000	And I would love to start that.
9335000	9337000	I keep thinking about doing it in my garage.
9337000	9345000	But it's not really climate controlled and it smells like cat box and it's dirty as fuck.
9345000	9347000	I have an F.U.
9347000	9349000	We don't have to have the music for it.
9349000	9354000	F.U. to people who go on Steam and ask me for free games.
9354000	9356000	Ask me to buy you a game.
9357000	9359000	I'm going to out this person right now.
9359000	9361000	No, no, no. Don't do it.
9361000	9364000	I'm going to out you on Twitter.
9364000	9366000	If you do this again.
9366000	9369000	The answer will always fucking be no.
9369000	9370000	Interesting.
9370000	9372000	If you're someone who I don't know who you are.
9372000	9376000	Or you're just a random so and so on my list.
9376000	9378000	Don't fucking ask me to buy you anything.
9378000	9380000	Did you add somebody on the list who you kind of didn't know?
9380000	9383000	I thought they were in the community.
9383000	9385000	But they've been on there for a while.
9385000	9386000	Interesting.
9386000	9389000	So no, the answer is always going to be no.
9389000	9392000	Unless like your birthday is coming up or something.
9392000	9395000	Or I think you're an okay person.
9395000	9397000	If you are just somebody on my friends list.
9397000	9399000	The answer is always fucking no.
9399000	9400000	Yeah. Okay.
9400000	9401000	That's fair.
9401000	9402000	Earn your own money.
9402000	9403000	Gifts or gifts?
9403000	9405000	Let's see. What was I going to say?
9405000	9406000	I would give you money for food.
9406000	9408000	But I'm not going to give you money for games.
9408000	9411000	This stream in chat says I get a free sub from Amazon Prime.
9411000	9413000	So I threw it at Rob's channel so he can get monies.
9413000	9414000	Well, I really appreciate that.
9414000	9415000	And I'll tell you what.
9415000	9417000	The money is just going to go right back to OLR.
9417000	9423000	Well, I mean, Bobby and I kind of both have some costs that we pay for Vaga Network.
9423000	9427000	So I actually pay for our radio feed that goes out there.
9427000	9430000	Bobby takes care of all the website stuff and other stuff too.
9430000	9432000	I'm drawing a very crude line.
9432000	9434000	So the money is going to go right back into that.
9434000	9438000	And we are looking at doing some upgrades here with Loki and talking about the laptop.
9439000	9442000	I think when that happens, I think I will be.
9442000	9447000	This mixing board has served us very well, but it has also served us for...
9447000	9449000	I remember when we placed the first mixing board.
9449000	9454000	This was 2006, this mixing board.
9454000	9457000	Do you remember Dark Sakura when this mixing board came into play?
9458000	9460000	It was, it wasn't cheap.
9460000	9464000	Yeah. So we'll probably replace that with something instead of analog, something digital.
9464000	9465000	I'm buying a game right now.
9465000	9466000	Are you really?
9466000	9467000	I'm buying 20XX.
9468000	9470000	MXC points this out.
9470000	9477000	One of my friends has like 5,000 games on Steam and Rando's used to ask him for free games before going private.
9477000	9479000	Oh, maybe somebody can see the size of the library.
9479000	9480000	That's kind of interesting.
9480000	9481000	Well, fuck them.
9481000	9482000	They just still know.
9482000	9485000	You can ogle my library all you fucking want.
9485000	9487000	Look, look and covet.
9488000	9495000	I do technically have extra Steam keys for a lot of games because I bought so many bundles that I'm sitting on multiple copies of a lot of things.
9495000	9497000	But I haven't really...
9497000	9499000	But you'll do that on your terms when you want to get those out.
9499000	9500000	Yeah.
9500000	9502000	I'm sorry. I will be that stingy bitch.
9502000	9503000	It's, it's fine.
9503000	9508000	S2100 Mountain Chat says the mixing board survived the Drunami mixing board table destruction.
9508000	9511000	Actually, I think that was the one before this.
9511000	9513000	You remember the black mixing board we had?
9513000	9514000	The old mixing...
9514000	9519000	Okay, for those that have seen the YouTube, I know we're just rambling tonight, but this is what happens when you don't call.
9519000	9520000	We ramble.
9520000	9524000	So the black mixing board, you can, that's the old one.
9524000	9528000	And you can actually see that in our rarely used YouTube channel.
9528000	9529000	No, I take that back.
9529000	9531000	We actually have a stock of back episodes on there.
9531000	9532000	Jason was working very hard.
9532000	9533000	I'll take it.
9533000	9536000	It was in the, it was in the NBC, the channel three.
9536000	9538000	Oh, it's so much fun video.
9538000	9539000	Yeah.
9539000	9543000	Which is on YouTube on our orange lounge radio channel.
9543000	9544000	That was the first mixing board.
9544000	9545000	That was the black one.
9545000	9547000	Now we have a gray one that Jamie just snapped a picture of.
9547000	9548000	So maybe she's posting.
9548000	9549000	It's going to go on my Insta.
9549000	9550000	There you go.
9550000	9555000	So, but we're looking at, at least I'm thinking about, cause you'll notice it's all analog.
9555000	9557000	And so I'm thinking about something maybe more digital.
9557000	9558000	So we'll see.
9558000	9564000	Well, and I actually, I know we've talked about me having a second set up with my MacBook.
9564000	9567000	You may take this and vlog away with it or whatever you want to do with it.
9567000	9570000	Well, but it also would be good, I think, to have a fallback for travel.
9570000	9574000	Cause I can just, you know, we've tested using GarageBand.
9574000	9575000	Yep.
9575000	9576000	And it was all right.
9576000	9577000	It was all right.
9577000	9578000	It wasn't the...
9578000	9579000	It was more the difference.
9579000	9580000	Yeah.
9580000	9583440	It was, it wasn't quite the clear quality that this show has, but it's good for like,
9583440	9587480	if we want to do something at this DDR tournament coming up and we need something quick and
9587480	9588840	dirty, it'll work.
9588840	9594000	I ordered an iPhone condenser mic for vlogging.
9594000	9595000	Yes.
9595000	9597960	I've actually thought about getting one of those two for the conventions and stuff.
9597960	9601140	The one I ordered, I ordered a cheap one to test it out, but there's another one that
9601140	9606160	was recommended that's about 50 bucks, but it's, it's more of an omni-directional and
9606160	9607160	you can change it.
9607160	9608160	Yeah.
9608160	9611560	So that one's on my list too, but I needed something, you know, I'm not going to spend
9611560	9614800	anything big because my iPhone 10 I'm going to get in January.
9614800	9615800	So.
9615800	9617800	There you go.
9617800	9621440	I've also got a steady cam ready to order too.
9621440	9622440	What's a steady cam?
9622440	9623440	Oh, for your vlog.
9623440	9624440	Cause you want to do vlogging.
9624440	9627800	Well, the thing, the good thing with the steady cam is that it uses a counterweight so that
9627800	9631600	no matter how you swing it, you have a steady spread the whole time.
9631600	9636440	I notice, uh, iPhone 10 and I only know, I don't, I can't compare it to anything Android
9636720	9638840	because I only know what I have and that's iPhone.
9638840	9641760	You can't control awesome to compare awesome to suck.
9641760	9643980	But the video quality is really good.
9643980	9647360	Like I was filming stuff at that, which by the way, we never got to talk about.
9647360	9649680	And you're, this is what you get when you don't call.
9649680	9653120	Dar Sacher wasn't able to talk about the Trixie and Katia's high school reunion thing with
9653120	9654840	me on the show last week.
9654840	9658840	But I shot some video there and I noticed, wow, like it doesn't shake.
9658840	9662120	Like the anti-shake stuff is really good stabilization in there.
9662120	9663120	Yeah.
9663120	9666420	And then like, as I'm panning back and forth, it's really smooth in the, so I was, I'm pretty
9666420	9667400	impressed.
9667400	9671180	Like what you're, and I can't see why androids don't have something better for a thousand
9671180	9672180	dollars.
9672180	9675100	I'm just really impressed at the fucking technology.
9675100	9679180	So if anyone's curious, it's on my Instagram, which is just dark Sakura.
9679180	9682300	So I put up the, the board in all of its dusty glory.
9682300	9683300	Yeah, I do.
9683300	9685740	I need to get some kind of compressed air and give that thing a bath.
9685740	9688140	You need microfiber cloths.
9688140	9689140	That's a pledge.
9689140	9691780	You know, my other thing is that I don't want to move any of the knobs.
9691780	9692780	I know.
9692780	9693780	I take a picture of the way it is.
9693780	9694780	I can set everything back.
9694780	9695780	I know.
9696140	9697820	All right, well, the phone's not ringing.
9697820	9701140	That means you ain't calling or it's broken, but again, I don't see anyone complaining,
9701140	9702140	but that's fine.
9702140	9703140	Y'all are just being shy.
9703140	9704140	It's cool.
9704140	9705140	It's cool.
9705140	9706140	Maybe next week.
9706140	9707140	Uh, we're going to wrap up the show for now though.
9707140	9708620	Uh, that's it.
9708620	9709740	We'll see you in seven days though.
9709740	9710740	We'll be back here.
9710740	9716140	I may be running a little late cause I'm going to be running back from San Francisco and
9716140	9722020	the Ingress event happening there because technically the big hoedown showdown is Saturday,
9722020	9723860	but then Sunday is the mission day.
9723940	9728020	Now with as long as I've been doing Ingress, I have yet to do a single fucking mission
9728020	9729020	day.
9729020	9733860	I missed the one in Chicago because I was flying home on Sunday, so I'm doing this one.
9733860	9737740	Even if this show is going to start late because of traffic, I'm fucking doing mission day
9737740	9743060	to get that fucking badge on my fucking profile that doesn't mean anything.
9743060	9744380	So there it is.
9744380	9745860	So I think it'll be fine though.
9745860	9749100	I think if I turn in the mission day thing by like two o'clock, three o'clock, that'll
9749100	9750340	give me time to get home.
9750340	9752540	I just may need Loki to produce next week episode.
9753220	9754900	I want to do a mission thingy.
9754900	9755900	I've never done one.
9755900	9757820	Come, come up to the city on Sunday.
9757820	9761260	Even if you don't want to do the Ingress, uh, hoedown throwdown on Saturday, you can
9761260	9762260	come do the mission day thingy.
9762260	9763860	Are you staying in the city?
9763860	9765460	Uh, probably.
9765460	9771020	I have to beg and plead my friend that I stay with, but I'm, I think I'd ran it by him already
9771020	9772020	and he knows.
9772020	9774300	I don't want to drive by myself.
9774300	9775300	I'm sorry.
9775300	9777940	Well, maybe who else plays here?
9777940	9780500	No one who would go with me.
9780500	9781500	You never know.
9781500	9782500	We'll see.
9783460	9784460	I'm not going to ride with people.
9784460	9785460	I don't know.
9785460	9787460	Like more than fleeting.
9787460	9788460	No, I understand.
9788460	9789460	I understand.
9789460	9790460	All right.
9790460	9791980	Uh, so there we go.
9791980	9792980	Uh, yeah.
9792980	9796140	So Squatch Kill is in chat saying, yes, I will be doing mission day.
9796140	9799180	You wonder, you see, he, I know if anybody knows what I'm going through, he knows what
9799180	9800220	I'm going through.
9800220	9807900	So if my show is late next week, then it's all Squatch Kill's fault, just so you know.
9807900	9810100	Or his wife's fault.
9810700	9813220	Anyway, I hope she's listening.
9813220	9814220	All right.
9814220	9819220	Uh, Oh, I liked that as to what her Matt's like, can you just give them your phone?
9819220	9820220	Hell the fuck?
9820220	9821220	No.
9821220	9823220	All right.
9823220	9824220	There we go.
9824220	9825220	We're going to wrap up.
9825220	9826220	Thanks you guys.
9826220	9828660	Uh, if you like what you heard here at orange launch radio, tell a friend or five about
9828660	9829660	the show.
9829660	9832580	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
9832580	9836660	But like, like when the phones don't light up, we can't get those, uh, voices out there
9836660	9838260	unless you, uh, let us know.
9838260	9839260	You can always email us.
9839420	9840420	You can tweet us at OLR.
9840420	9842580	You can Facebook us at orange launch radio.
9842580	9847300	You can use the website to send us a message because now we know that works.
9847300	9848900	Remember when it was broken for four years?
9848900	9852380	Well, we got our first email tonight that came from the website, so it works.
9852380	9856000	So you can do all those things, but just tell a friend or two about the show.
9856000	9857460	Help us spread the word.
9857460	9864180	Um, because we don't have a big website or Fox news or CBS backing up this program.
9864180	9867140	So it's just us.
9867140	9868140	That's it.
9868140	9869620	Uh, help us spread the word.
9869620	9872100	Uh, I haven't found something really dirty to say.
9872100	9874620	All right, well then we'll go around and get everybody's final thought.
9874620	9875620	Oh yeah.
9875620	9876620	Five star review on iTunes.
9876620	9877940	Those places goes a long way too.
9877940	9880620	We'll go around and get everybody's final thoughts since Jamie has something to say.
9880620	9883220	I'm not going to say anything dirty cause I'm bad.
9883220	9884220	We'll start with Loki.
9884220	9885220	All right.
9885220	9890940	Um, I guess I will, you know, play VR games this week.
9890940	9891940	There you go.
9891940	9892940	VR Skyrim.
9892940	9893940	Who sold that?
9893940	9894940	I didn't.
9894940	9902020	I didn't buy it in because I've, I've already bought Skyrim and Skyrim HD and I have Skyrim
9902020	9904180	HD in my PC and I haven't bothered.
9904180	9910340	I was going to hold off in purchase on PCs someday when you know it's out cause I think
9910340	9914140	it's going to be better because on the PlayStation it's just kind of okay.
9914140	9917060	And eventually I do want to get VR headset for my PC.
9917060	9919740	I just haven't done it yet.
9919740	9920740	So I'm going to hold off.
9920740	9921740	I don't need it.
9921740	9924420	I just, I have a bunch of PlayStation VR games.
9924420	9926260	I just bought them.
9926260	9927940	I don't need another one.
9927940	9931780	My final thought is, and I'm only thinking this cause I can see my collection of fridge
9931780	9935580	magnets and I have a fridge magnet of this lady and I was just going to say Gilda Radner
9935580	9937100	was fucking awesome.
9937100	9938100	She was.
9938100	9939100	She was so fucking awesome.
9939100	9940500	Anyway, uh, dark soccer.
9940500	9941500	Your final thought?
9941500	9945820	Um, I'm going to go harass your cat now.
9945820	9946820	It sounds good.
9946820	9952180	Just get one of those fish cake things you had that he was, I digested them.
9952180	9953180	All right.
9953180	9954180	I'll burp fish out.
9954180	9955180	I do.
9955180	9956180	All right.
9956180	9957180	That's it.
9957180	9958180	Cats have no sense of sweetness.
9958180	9959180	We're done.
9959180	9961820	We'll be back in seven days later.
9961820	9965220	You've been listening to orange lounge radio.
