00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We're an hour earlier and yet somehow still exactly the same time

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We hope you're well rested with the extra hour you gained last night because tonight you'll need that brain working

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We have news to catch up on, report, and make and it all starts right now in the show where every gamer has a voice

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello my friends and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight, episode number 706 of our show for this November the 5th of 2017

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I almost said November the 2017 of the 5th

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Yes, remember the 5th of November or whatever that is, I never even saw that movie, I just heard about it through everybody else

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You don't know about the actual Guy Fawkes day?

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Whatever I read on Wikipedia and then promptly forgot

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Girl

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Hi DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers, how are you?

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm your resident history nerd

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And enjoying some decaf coffee tonight

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
My face is burnt now

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I decided to punish DarkSakura tonight for what I don't know

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
But I said you're going to drink this out of the DC Comics Justice League mug that I have because she's not a big fan of DC

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
But then Loki, Techmaster Loki over there suggested DC is decaf

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Decaf coffee

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
This DC decaf mug

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Yes

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Perfect

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And for the record, remember remember the 5th of November the gunpowder treason and plot

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I know of no reason why the gunpowder treason should ever be forgot

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Okay

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
That's how it goes, so whatever

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Alright, props to you

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And I could not in a train

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Y'all need culture

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Y'all wouldn't know culture if you got smacked in the face with yogurt

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Remember remember, one fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Y'all bitches need culture

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Listen to the muffins child, listen to the don'ts

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Don't let the cat in the hat in your house because you'll fuck shit up

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And you know what? Fucking banana muffin

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Alright anyway, hi everybody, we got a busy week

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So first I want to say sorry we weren't here last week and that was totally my fault

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I had no voice at all last week

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
When I woke up Saturday morning I had hosted Rocky the night before

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And I guess I was a little more extra than usual because it was Halloween after all

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And so when I woke up on Saturday

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It was literally like this

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And I didn't know it

46
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Like you should have asked Alan about how I sounded, it wasn't pretty

47
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And so I have to make a judgement call on if there's going to be a show or no show

48
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Because there's not going to be a show, Dark Soccer and Loki should get their evening back

49
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So around 2 o'clock I was still sounding like this

50
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So I was like alright we're not doing a show because I have to rest my voice because I need it for my job

51
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So sorry guys but shit happens

52
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So that's what happened last week

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Sadly we won't be here next week

54
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
That was the pre-planned week off because of the long Veterans Day weekend

55
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm actually going to be out of town

56
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm going to Seattle so hoping to hit up some gaming related fun places while I'm up there

57
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I just found out today

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm going to go visit an old friend

59
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm going to visit an old friend from LiveJournal who I've never met before

60
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
She lives in Bellevue so I get to go over there which I haven't been to before

61
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I think that's just a stone's throw away from where

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Where's Nintendo and Microsoft? Redmond?

63
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yeah I gotta travel there just to look at an office building

64
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Because that's what they are, office buildings

65
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
There's nothing that exciting but at least I can say I went

66
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You have to go to the Pinball Museum in Seattle

67
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Is there a Pinball Museum in Seattle?

68
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
There is, I'll have to find out where

69
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'll send you the address

70
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yeah tell me where it is, I wouldn't mind hitting that up

71
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Because we did all the big touristy stuff last time we were there

72
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So we've done the Space Needle, we did the EMP, we did all that stuff

73
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So I mean we'll probably do some of it again

74
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
But I wouldn't mind seeing other parts of Seattle too

75
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So we'll see

76
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Anyhow so we've got to make this show really good

77
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Because it's got to last for a few weeks for people

78
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So sorry about that

79
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You can also of course join us live

80
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
We do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network

81
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
vognetwork.com

82
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

83
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Usually right after our pal Bobby Black Wolf

84
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
But we're not the only one that's been having issues lately

85
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Bobby's been having internet drama

86
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
That's been keeping him offline

87
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
He doesn't have enough bandwidth at home I guess

88
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Something in his neighborhood has screwed something up

89
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And here's my thought Bobby

90
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Maybe it's somebody's Xbox

91
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Because I want to talk about this

92
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So this is some drama that is like unfolding on Twitter as we speak

93
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Because I had a pretty serious problem today

94
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
And it's my Xbox's fault

95
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Now let me tell you what's going on

96
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So I get online today and I'm setting up for the show tonight by logging on to vognetwork.com

97
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
But I get a new pop-up window that I don't usually get on vognetwork.com

98
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And it's Xfinity

99
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And I was like wow I've never seen that before

100
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And Xfinity actually popped, which is Comcast

101
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
They popped up a thing that said you are at 90% of your bandwidth for the month

102
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You have used 900 and something gigs out of your 1024 that are available

103
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Because everybody has a terabyte of data a month now

104
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It used to be like 250 and then it's been slowly climbing up

105
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Well I was like the fuck?

106
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And they were like for the calendar month

107
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And I'm like it is the 5th of November

108
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
And I've used a terabyte of data this month

109
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm like what the fuck's going on?

110
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So I log into the Comcast website

111
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And sure enough most months we use about maybe 380 gigs

112
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I think last month there was 410 gigs

113
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
But I downloaded Destiny 2 PC last month right?

114
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So it's going to be a little more

115
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
But usually we use between 300 and 400 gigs

116
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Which is pretty impressive considering there's two tech nerds in this house

117
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Myself and my husband

118
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I do this radio show on Sunday Night from here

119
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And I've been doing live streaming

120
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And you probably watch Netflix and all that

121
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Yeah I binge watch Stranger Things 2 when that first came out

122
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So we use a lot of technology

123
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
But sure enough it was like

124
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
At this point it said I'd use something like

125
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
1050 gigs or something like that

126
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I was like what the hell is going on?

127
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Well luckily my pal Xtifer

128
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Who you guys remember from Guys on a Show

129
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
He bought me as a Christmas present this last year

130
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
A Google Wifi

131
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And the reason why this helps right now is because

132
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
On Google Wifi you can with the phone app

133
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Go in and it shows you which devices are connected

134
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
What's using bandwidth right now

135
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And you can pull a report for the last 7 days

136
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
The last 30 days

137
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So I was like alright well I remember that

138
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
So I was like I want to see is it on my computer

139
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Is it on Alan's computer

140
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Is there an unknown device that's figured out our Wifi password

141
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
That's downloading all of the porn

142
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Like what's going on?

143
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
So I go onto the Google

144
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
The Google Wifi and I pull the report and it says

145
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
My Xbox has pulled down

146
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I think it's 940 gigabytes

147
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
In the past 7 days

148
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
940

149
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
By itself

150
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
The Xbox

151
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I have a 1 terabyte drive on the Xbox One

152
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
So I started

153
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Obviously I did what anybody does

154
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And I wrote passive aggressive tweets about the situation

155
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Tagging Xfinity and tagging

156
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Xbox because I'm sitting here going

157
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
The Xfinity website is like you get charged

158
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
$10 for every 50 gigs you go over

159
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And I'm like fuck that

160
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I didn't do anything

161
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So I called and

162
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
They told me that you get like

163
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
2 courtesy months

164
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Or something

165
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Like you get months where you're allowed to go over

166
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
And they don't penalize you

167
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
So this month is going to end up being a courtesy month

168
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I guess for me

169
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm going to download all the porn now

170
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Might as well at this point right

171
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
But I'm still kind of shocked

172
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Like what the hell happened

173
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
So obviously one thing that's on my mind

174
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
That I think a lot of people are suggesting on Twitter

175
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Because now one of my buddies

176
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Who runs another podcast that's more popular than this one

177
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Retweeted like all my tweets

178
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I don't know if he was having the same problems or what

179
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
But now I've got all these people that are giving me suggestions

180
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
And everybody is kind of saying

181
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Well do you have an Xbox One X

182
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
That's the first question I get

183
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
The answer is no

184
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I have not changed my Xbox One

185
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Since Forza Horizon 2 was new

186
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
And that was the game that convinced me to get a new Xbox

187
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I bought my Xbox when they just released

188
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
That one terabyte model

189
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
So I do have a one terabyte Xbox One

190
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
But still

191
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Why is my Xbox trying to download

192
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
940 gigs to my one terabyte Xbox One

193
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So I unplugged the fucker

194
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I was like you're done

195
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I unplugged it

196
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
The one thing the Comcast guy suggested I do

197
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Which I was like oh yeah that's kind of obvious

198
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
He said change your Wi-Fi pass

199
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Or just make sure nobody else has it

200
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
He's like cause I can't see on my end

201
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
What devices are using your bandwidth

202
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And I'm sitting here going

203
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I just fucking told you it's my Xbox

204
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
But I'm like don't get mad at the call center people

205
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
They're just doing their job

206
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So I was like alright you know what

207
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Why not

208
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Is changing your Wi-Fi password a bad idea

209
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
No it's not

210
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So I went ahead and did that

211
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
So now I plug back in the Xbox

212
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'm just not going to give the Xbox the new password

213
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Trying to figure out what's going on

214
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
And I do notice it's trying to download

215
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
A 43 gigabyte update for Quantum Break

216
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And I'd heard that Quantum Break was getting a big update

217
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
But I don't have a 4K TV

218
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I don't have an Xbox One X

219
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I don't understand why

220
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Was it attempted to download it like 20 times

221
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
That's what I think is happening

222
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
That it's been attempted

223
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Now I can't prove this yet

224
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
But I don't have a lot of space left on my Xbox One

225
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I filled that thing to the brim

226
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
That terabyte

227
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I mean because I don't usually delete things

228
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Because why should I

229
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
So it's like 92% full

230
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
So I'm wondering if

231
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Is it trying to download

232
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
The Quantum Break update

233
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Failing and starting over

234
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Over and over again

235
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Possibly

236
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
So here's

237
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It should be smart to see that it can't fit on there

238
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So it can't update it

239
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
That's what it does on the PlayStation

240
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
That's

241
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
And that

242
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Geez Microsoft learn

243
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
But here's the weird thing you guys

244
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I can't

245
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Like nobody else on Twitter is complaining about this

246
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So I can't sit here and go

247
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Microsoft's got a big problem

248
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
This is widespread

249
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Where's the news story on Kotaku

250
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Alerting everybody about this

251
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Because it does seem like

252
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'm the only guy that this is happening to

253
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
But here's my first question everybody

254
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Would you go look at your bandwidth report

255
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
For the month

256
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And especially if you have Google Wi-Fi

257
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Or something similar that will tell you

258
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
What your Xbox is doing

259
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
And would you let me know

260
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
If anybody else out there

261
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Is having this extreme problem

262
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
That I'm having

263
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Just makes me glad I never bought one

264
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I guess but I mean

265
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I don't know what to think

266
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Like I want to say I feel bad for Microsoft

267
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
But I don't

268
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
But it's weird that this is isolated

269
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Like that's the

270
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
And so it makes me wonder did I do something wrong

271
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
But I haven't done anything outside the norm

272
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I barely use my Xbox One for gaming

273
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It's just a Microsoft device

274
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It likes updating on the fly

275
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Here's a thought

276
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
That maybe you have enough

277
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Because you know there's a difference between

278
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Actual size and virtual space right

279
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Right

280
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
So it could mean that you have enough in one aspect

281
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
But the moment that it's filling up the cache

282
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It's hitting that point where it can't

283
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
But it's still reading that you've got room for it

284
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Yeah I don't know

285
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
So you just might be at a sweet spot for that

286
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Interesting

287
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Or in this case a sour spot

288
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Well I'm gonna go look at some comments in chat

289
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Because everybody's playing armchair IT

290
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Which when you get a bunch of nerds together

291
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
That's what's going to happen

292
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Not me I'm not at work

293
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
So in our chat room

294
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Over at live.vognetwork.com

295
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Because again we do tape live

296
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Six o'clock Pacific

297
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Nine o'clock Eastern

298
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Oh and Bobby, thank you very much

299
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Bobby Blackwolf did make it to chat tonight

300
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
And he says he fixed the web chat

301
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
So if live.vognetwork.com wasn't working for you before

302
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It might now

303
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Because he changed the web app

304
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
So hopefully it'll work again

305
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Thanks Bobby

306
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Speaking of armchair IT

307
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Let's see

308
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I'm looking in chat

309
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Tigerclaw says

310
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
When you leave your Xbox One in an instant on mode

311
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Whenever you get one of those free Xbox One games

312
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It'll automatically download them too

313
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
So it's best to have power saving mode enabled

314
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I've never had a game download that I didn't tell it to

315
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Like I will go into the Xbox gold membership thing

316
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
And download what I

317
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
But I've never had the Xbox just say

318
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Surprise we delivered you a game

319
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
So I don't have that setting on

320
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I have had it update games

321
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
But that's

322
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I mean

323
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Usually you want that right

324
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Isn't that what PlayStation Plus had as a feature

325
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
When it first launched was auto updating games

326
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Yeah I mean that's what PlayStation does now

327
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
But like if I don't have space for the update

328
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It knows it's like well this isn't gonna fit

329
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
So we're not updating

330
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Bobby Blockwolf says

331
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I think the Xbox One actually has a thing in settings

332
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
That shows its data usage

333
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
A I can't find it

334
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
But probably B because

335
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
For it to do anything it wants to go online

336
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
And I'm sure as you all can sympathize right now

337
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I don't want to put my Xbox One back online

338
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Although I guess if this month is gonna be a wash anyway

339
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Maybe now's the time to do it

340
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
When I can sit there and watch it

341
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
But I'd prefer to know at least a little bit about what I'm doing

342
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Before I put it back online if that makes sense

343
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Maybe I can tell

344
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I bet through Google Wi-Fi

345
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I bet I can let it go online

346
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
But like throttle it

347
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I think Google Wi-Fi lets you do that

348
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I think you can say

349
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
This device can use no more than X amount of data per second or something

350
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
So maybe that's what I'll do

351
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I gotta say

352
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
The winner in this whole scenario is Google Wi-Fi

353
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
So props to that

354
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Because that helped me figure out what it is

355
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
So that when people on the internet are like

356
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Are you sure you didn't get hacked

357
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Or how do you know it's your Xbox

358
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It's like I got the receipts

359
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Receipts, I has them

360
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Here they are

361
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Korkay in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says

362
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Go for the high score

363
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Why not?

364
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Why not?

365
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Even though I kind of promised him I wasn't gonna do that

366
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
But there you go

367
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Alright

368
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
So yeah some folks in chat

369
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
SSU100Matt says I'm only seeing I use 15 gigs

370
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Tigerclass says I'm only using 49 gigs

371
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Well good for y'all

372
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Yeah I know

373
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
But that's the weird

374
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Those guys have Xbox ones

375
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
And so what is unique about my situation

376
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I don't know

377
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I can't figure it out

378
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
But I can tell you it's trying to download an update for Quantum Break and Forza

379
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
And I put all the screenshots on my Twitter

380
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Twitter.com slash Skye S-K-I-E

381
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
If you wanna continue to play Armchair Warrior

382
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I tagged Xbox in all these posts so maybe Xbox support will fire me back something

383
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
But I don't

384
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Like

385
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Here's the thing at the end of the day

386
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I don't particularly care if my Xbox is gonna download all of this data

387
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I care that I'm gonna get charged for it

388
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
So

389
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
And especially if this isn't just happening to me

390
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
You know what I'm saying?

391
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Really just fuck Comcast

392
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Cause that's really the problem

393
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Cause if you had unlimited bandwidth as we should all

394
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
It wouldn't even be an issue

395
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
That's true

396
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
So there's you know

397
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
But I also think the system

398
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
The Xbox should be smart enough

399
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
That like

400
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
There should be some type of internal trigger

401
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
That when it's used a hundred gigabytes in a month

402
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Or two hundred gigabytes in a month

403
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It should pop up a window going

404
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I'm eating a lot of data and this is why

405
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Do you wanna continue?

406
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Like at least give me the option to put

407
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Cause I would have never known this was happening

408
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
If that pop up

409
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
From Xfinity

410
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
So to Comcast credit

411
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
If they hadn't put a pop up

412
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
That said you've used ninety percent

413
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Hey it looks like that you've used a lot of data

414
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Would you like me to download some more data for you?

415
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Says Clippy

416
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
There you go

417
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
So that's the drama I've been dealing with

418
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
So stay tuned for potentially an update in two weeks

419
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
But for right now the Xbox One is sitting in the corner

420
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It is not allowed to have the new Wi-Fi password

421
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
That is the punishment

422
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Grounded dammit

423
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You're grounded and you're not getting the Wi-Fi password

424
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
That is what's happening

425
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Loki and DarkSakura got the new Wi-Fi password

426
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
But the Xbox did not get the Wi-Fi password

427
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Now that I know that I can download as much as I want

428
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I'm downloading all the porn right now so it's fine

429
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Like Corky said earlier in chat

430
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Go for the high score

431
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Why not?

432
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Come on Nolgus in chat says

433
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Does Xbox have a beta thing

434
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Xbox Insider or something?

435
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
You know what for the sake of transparency

436
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Yes they do

437
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
And I'm in it

438
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
So is that

439
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Is the problem because my console is doing something

440
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
In a beta mode

441
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Which I understand

442
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Microsoft's gonna wash your hands of liability

443
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
If that thing happened or whatever

444
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
No that's just usually

445
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
It just means it downloads more frequent

446
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
System updates

447
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
980 gigs of updates

448
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Good

449
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I mean but I doubt it would

450
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I doubt it would keep doing that though

451
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Yeah

452
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Because usually it would just download

453
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
You know the latest one

454
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Brad from Paw Culture says

455
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
You have the Xbox on Wi-Fi

456
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
That has to be rough on gaming

457
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
No

458
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I actually

459
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Right now because the PlayStation 4

460
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Moved into my office

461
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
So I could do streaming from the PlayStation 4

462
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
My Xbox One has become the CBS

463
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
So I can watch Star Trek Discovery device

464
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Netflix for when I binge watched

465
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Stranger Things 2

466
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
When we weren't here last week

467
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Device

468
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
So it's been kind of my main media device

469
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Maybe it's Star Trek Discovery's fault

470
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Did Star Trek Discovery break my Xbox

471
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Maybe it did

472
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Perhaps I don't know

473
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
But all those things have been running fine

474
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
And great quality

475
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I don't have 4K

476
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
My television isn't 4K

477
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
So I wasn't downloading like 4K Stranger Things

478
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
But still

479
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
And again that was all technically October

480
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Because I watched that Stranger Things

481
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Like in the first three days

482
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
You guys it is so good

483
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
It is so good

484
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Stranger Things in 4K

485
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Except for Episode 7

486
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Fuck Episode 7

487
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
But The Resident's fine

488
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Which one was Episode 7?

489
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
The one that was

490
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Without spoiling

491
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
The Back Door Pilot

492
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
The Back Door Pilot

493
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Oh yeah

494
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
That little

495
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I don't know

496
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I liked the main person in that one

497
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Yeah me too

498
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Me too

499
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
A lot

500
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Plus I liked the makeover

501
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Yeah

502
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
We have to keep it

503
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Plus it was all MTV

504
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Some people are very hyper about spoilers

505
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I know

506
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
That's all I'm saying

507
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
When do we get to spoil the shit out of Stranger Things?

508
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I guess we have to give it a good 60 days

509
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Huh?

510
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
2018?

511
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I don't know

512
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Too soon

513
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Anyway

514
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I guess also that's kind of the department of critical myth

515
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Pod culture

516
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
The more TV based shows on our network to get into

517
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
We're usually here to talk about games

518
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I do want to talk about games

519
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
So the kickoff topic I did want to talk about

520
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Was I wanted to talk a little bit about

521
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Digital distribution

522
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Now this is a topic that's come up on our show before

523
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
But

524
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I don't know if you guys heard about this this week

525
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
But there were some major earnings calls

526
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
That happened in this past week

527
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Activision, EA

528
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
They do their quarterly stockholder calls

529
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Because at the end of the day

530
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Companies like EA, Activision

531
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
They exist

532
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
What?

533
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
To make money

534
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
To make who money?

535
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
To make their shareholders money

536
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
And that's why people talk about investing in the stock market

537
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Right?

538
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
America 101

539
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
There you go

540
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Okay

541
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
So every quarter

542
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
These companies have to basically produce

543
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
You know

544
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
They have to update their shareholders on what they're doing

545
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
So Activision did an earnings call this past week

546
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Where they said

547
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,000
50% of Destiny 2's sales on consoles came via download

548
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Rather than a retail disc

549
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Now

550
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I would have believed that

551
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
If we were talking the PC numbers only

552
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Because I would have thought

553
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Oh there's a ton of people

554
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
That probably just do digital on PC

555
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Because of storefronts like Battle.net and so forth

556
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
And that there's people that are buying Destiny with Warcraft gold

557
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Because you can do that

558
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
The way things are set up on Battle.net

559
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
But no

560
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
That factor is for

561
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I guess all of it

562
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Or for the consoles

563
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I buy everything digitally

564
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
For the most part

565
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Yeah

566
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
And I guess this is getting bigger and bigger

567
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Earlier this year

568
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
EA said

569
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
They expect 40% of their console game sales to come from downloads in 2017

570
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
That is a jump up 10% from where they were at

571
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
30% of sales in 2016

572
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
EA has gone on record before saying

573
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Quote

574
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
They're gonna be 100% digital company period

575
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
It's going to be there someday

576
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It's inevitable

577
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
No

578
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
And I don't think that's gonna be the case

579
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Because here's the problem

580
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Yes

581
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
It's a nice idea to have it all digital and everything

582
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
But if everybody goes all digital

583
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Remember there's that wonderful company

584
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Comcast

585
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
That has those wonderful bandwidth caps

586
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
That will fuck you over

587
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Right

588
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
If you try to download everything

589
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
So that's why it will never be that way

590
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Because fucking net neutrality and all that shit is

591
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Not in the picture because

592
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Those companies want to make money too

593
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
So

594
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Because you have that

595
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
And also because

596
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
And this is very important

597
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
These same fucking companies

598
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Keep pushing these stupid

599
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Collectors editions

600
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
And shit with giant statue editions

601
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
You can't digitally download those

602
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
You can't digitally download a statue

603
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
You wouldn't want to digitally download a statue

604
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Correct

605
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Okay

606
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
So you think there's still going to be a market

607
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
For physical stuff

608
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
But it's gonna be kind of limited

609
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It's gonna be like

610
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
They do it now

611
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
They can still do digital distribution

612
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
But they do it now where they have editions

613
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
It's collectors editions that don't include the game

614
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Why?

615
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I know

616
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Why would you do that?

617
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
So

618
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Well is it because they expect that people are gonna

619
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Download to play hour zero digitally

620
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
So this is just literally a box of shit

621
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
With the games branding on it

622
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I mean like for me like if I'm gonna

623
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
If I'm looking forward to a game

624
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
And I want to play it day one

625
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I'm not gonna pre-order

626
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Because that means I gotta drive out to the store

627
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
To go pick it up and do all that nonsense

628
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Whereas I can

629
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Digitally pre-order it or download it

630
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Fuck I'm not pre-ordering shit

631
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
But I'll digitally order it like

632
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
The day before or something like that

633
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
And it'll unlock at 9pm the night before it comes out

634
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
That's what I did with Destiny 2 on PC

635
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Is that I bought it like two days before it launched

636
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
So it would be all loaded and ready to go

637
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
But with Destiny 2 I knew

638
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
If I walked into a store and bought it on a box

639
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
All I was gonna get

640
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Maybe I was gonna get a Blu-ray or DVD with the game

641
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
But it was likely gonna be a code

642
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
And a game like that is so much online anyway

643
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
You're gonna get some code for your online access

644
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
So there's no reason to really have the physical edition

645
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Whereas here's my thing

646
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I guess I've had the hardest time buying into this digital stuff

647
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Because I'm still this big believer of

648
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Well when you buy a game on a disc or on a cartridge

649
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Let's say Mario Odyssey on the flip side of things

650
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I have a cartridge for that

651
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
And if someday I decide I'm sick of Mario Odyssey

652
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Which I doubt is gonna happen

653
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
But we'll get into that later

654
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I could sell that cartridge

655
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Or I could loan that

656
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
What happened to that?

657
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
It's because I'm lazy

658
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Two things

659
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
One, I'm lazy

660
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
So I don't wanna have to worry about selling that cartridge

661
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Or whatever

662
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
And it depends on the system

663
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Like if I had a Switch

664
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
There's not a lot of onboard storage for that

665
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Then yes, physical copies are gonna be more appealing to me

666
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Whereas I've got 500GB of space on my Playstation 4

667
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
So I can download a bunch of games at once

668
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
And I don't have to worry about swapping discs out and stuff like that

669
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Not to say that I don't buy disc versions of games

670
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I do sometimes

671
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
It's just not all the time

672
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Usually I'm getting stuff on sale

673
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
But with that

674
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
There's also another factor

675
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
GameStop is not gonna really be happy with them going all digital

676
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
They've tried to do it in the past

677
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
They've tried to say that they're gonna go all digital

678
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Never gonna happen

679
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Because it's such a big monster

680
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
And they control the industry

681
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
So they're not gonna

682
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
It's not gonna happen

683
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
They're never gonna be fully digital

684
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Because there's people that want physical versions of the game

685
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
There's gonna be GameStop

686
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
And other big retailers that that's a big chunk of their money

687
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Well GameStop, it's most of their money

688
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
So they're not gonna just give that up quietly

689
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
And bandwidth caps

690
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
You're not gonna be able to do that

691
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Plus internet speeds

692
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Because as these games get bigger and bigger

693
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
The 4K content

694
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
That's more data that you're dumping down the tubes

695
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
And it's gonna take a lot longer to download

696
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Especially with all these internet companies fighting to upgrade their service

697
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I wanted to get to DarkSakura's perspective

698
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
But real quick

699
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I wanted to mention

700
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I was noticing a lot of parallels maybe with the music industry

701
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
You know 10 years ago with the invention of the iPod or whatever

702
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
And you know just the fact that a lot of people were pirating their music

703
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
With things like Napster or whatever

704
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Apple kind of came up with this method to legitimize it

705
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
A lot of other people kind of went on that as well

706
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
But anyway my point is

707
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
A lot of record stores are gone because of it

708
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Tower Records

709
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Gone

710
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
The Warehouse

711
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Gone

712
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
All these big record stores I remember from my youth they're gone

713
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Now that's left are indie niche places

714
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
You know like we have a local chain here, Dimple

715
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
You know they seem to do pretty well because

716
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
They also expand the books and movies

717
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Yeah that's true

718
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
They've also expanded to books and movies

719
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
And I noticed

720
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
What's the music that people seem to be buying these days?

721
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Vinyl

722
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Vinyl

723
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Exactly

724
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
And it's kind of that collector's edition stuff

725
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I found a place downtown

726
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Because I was when I had to get my window replaced on my Fiat

727
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
And I was at this little place like 16th and E

728
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
And walked around down E to go have breakfast at this little place called Shine

729
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Have you ever been there?

730
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
No

731
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
But on the way there there's like this little like thrift store

732
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
But it was all full of fucking vinyl

733
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Nothing but vinyl in a thrift store

734
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Yeah and speaking of I'm going on this trip to Seattle

735
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
And I remember one of the things I bought on my last trip to Seattle

736
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
This is like seriously one of my prized possessions

737
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
This is my copy of Abba's The Visitors

738
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
My favorite album from one of my favorite bands

739
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I bought you one

740
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Probably my favorite band ever

741
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
You did

742
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I got you Super Trooper

743
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
You got me Super Trooper

744
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
But this is the one that I got in Seattle at Pike Place Market

745
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
At a very similar store

746
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
It was like a thrift store but it was all vinyl

747
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
And I was like do they have Abba, Abba, Abba, Abba

748
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
And then they had the visitors

749
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
What's that place in San Francisco on Market near Castro?

750
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Is that Rasputin?

751
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Yeah I think it's Rasputin

752
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Because that's used to where I would go to buy laser discs

753
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Like I found my Wizard of Oz laser disc there

754
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
It's like two places down from like the Brody salon

755
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
But it's like right there at Market in Castro

756
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
J.D. has regrets to inform us they closed

757
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Sad

758
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat saying

759
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I buy new albums on vinyl now and get the free MP3 download for the USB stick in my car

760
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
So

761
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I have one

762
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I only have a handful of albums

763
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I have a copy of Rubber Soul because that was my favorite Beatles album

764
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I have Gorillaz Demon Days which I have it unopened

765
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
So if I need a quick 500 bones I could sell it

766
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Because it's a first printing

767
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I have two Rodale albums

768
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I have Even Worse and then I have Mandatory Fun

769
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Because we got them to sign it

770
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Yeah I mean I don't even own a record player

771
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
So the only reason I own that Abba on vinyl

772
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Is because it is a relic of the time period from which that album came out

773
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
And that record was likely used to play that music

774
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,000
You know what I mean like it's more the collector thrift store kind of atmosphere of it

775
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
It's very hard to explain but I bet a lot of you that have bought vinyls

776
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Probably understand

777
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,000
It's more the fact that you know I own something of that time period that is that album

778
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I almost bought a Panasonic record player at that place

779
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Well the record player is coming back

780
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
You know why?

781
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Anyway let me

782
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Wait it had an 8 track player

783
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
We've been too far into music which you know I know a lot of us love music

784
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
But Jamie what are your thoughts quickly on the digital versus

785
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Especially because you've been a big collector

786
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
But I don't know how much you guys have embraced digital

787
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
But what's kind of your thoughts when you hear EA saying

788
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
We're going to be a 100% digital company

789
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Okay

790
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I kind of don't care

791
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Okay if it wasn't EA saying it what about Activision?

792
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Still don't care

793
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Still don't care because then

794
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Probably even less so

795
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I mean like look at all of the like World of Warcraft

796
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Look at Overwatch

797
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Look at all that

798
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Right

799
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Those are already digital only pretty much

800
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Right

801
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I mean you used to be able to get discs for them

802
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
But computers aren't even built with DVD drives anymore

803
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
You know

804
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I'm like this

805
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
My thought is that if I download a game

806
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
That I want to keep badly enough

807
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I'm going to copy those files off to external media

808
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
And have an archive

809
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I do that anyway with my stuff

810
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
You know my um

811
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
For example I mean my iTunes directory right

812
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
It's all housed on an external drive

813
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I manage that shit myself

814
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
My games are exactly the same way

815
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I have two internal drives one of them that's for all of my games

816
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
And it's marked so that I can take it out and put it in enclosure if I want to

817
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
And I have my 3 terabyte drive that I save all of my save files to

818
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
So

819
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
And the point of all this

820
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Is that the PSP Go is just ahead of its time

821
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Really wasn't it

822
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
No

823
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I mean

824
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
It was ahead of something

825
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I don't think it had a lot of storage

826
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,000
And the problem with the PSP Go is their stupid proprietary memory stick shit

827
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
That's also the other thing that kind of hurt the Vita

828
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Is because they want to charge extra for their proprietary memory stick formats

829
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
So that

830
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
They can make more money

831
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
It's all about greed

832
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
That's the other thing about these companies saying oh we're going 100% digital

833
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Do you really want them to be the only source of being able to purchase those files

834
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Because if they go all digital

835
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
That means that there's no competition anymore

836
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Because they're selling their game on one store front

837
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
And that's it

838
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
And there's not a chance that you're going to get it on sale

839
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I mean they do sales every now and then

840
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
But you know it's a lot more prevalent with physical versions

841
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
So it just

842
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
And plus they're fucking lame

843
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
But they're fucking you know

844
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Microtransaction bullshit that they're piecing shit apart

845
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
That's where they're making most of their money digitally

846
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Is from that shit

847
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
And not necessarily I don't think selling digital copies

848
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
So Orange Dontradio we do like to say we are the show where every gamer has a voice

849
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
In an effort to kind of expand that and get more voices on our show

850
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Tried something new this week and went to our Discord with this topic

851
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Again you can join us on Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord

852
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
That will get you the invite you need to get on there

853
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
You don't need a special code outside of that

854
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Just go to vognetwork.com slash Discord

855
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
And I asked our members on Discord their opinions on this

856
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Let me read you some of the answers from Discord

857
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Corky said I buy digital games when they're cheaper

858
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Or when they're PC games that are just a code in a box

859
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I've never owned a current gen console

860
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
So paying $60 for a game and trading it in after isn't something I've been able to do

861
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I do sell old games on eBay to pay for my gaming habit

862
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
But it's a fairly rare occurrence

863
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Evil G will probably be a general geek culture store

864
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Like it's slowly transitioning to

865
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,000
My local one is probably one third ugly Funko Pops and clothing

866
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I think you know what speaking of the Funko Pops

867
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
And look I own a few of them myself admittedly

868
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I have the Golden Girls Funko Pops

869
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I have a Winston from Overwatch sitting there

870
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
We really need to draw the line on those things

871
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Like those fuckers are everywhere

872
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
I found them at a thrift store

873
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I'm kinda over it you guys

874
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Like we need something new

875
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Like Funko Pops are losing cool points

876
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Let people love what they love

877
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
You're right, you're right

878
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
You spend your hard earned money on whatever you want

879
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:01,000
But it's crazy going into like half the stores in the mall have an entire wall dedicated to it

880
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,000
And it's like do we need that many Funko Pops?

881
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
You haven't seen my cube

882
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
How many Funko Pops do you have in your cube at work?

883
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Too many to count

884
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
No I know what I have

885
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I have a baby group

886
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I have a regular group

887
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I don't need the whole inventory just a number

888
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
No I'm actually going through it

889
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
That's five on that one

890
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Alright while you count

891
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Dark Tetsuya talking about

892
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Eleven in my cube

893
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Dark Tetsuya talking about

894
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I'm not super into mainstream AAA titles

895
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
But I definitely prefer physical whenever I can

896
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,000
A lot of indie publishers are doing physical releases for their upcoming Switch titles

897
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Like I believe Limited Run Games is starting to do that

898
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Maybe I'm old school but I just like seeing my game collection on the shelf

899
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
And with physical releases sometimes you get extras

900
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Like Mighty No. 9 came with a poster, an art book

901
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
It's just not the same as a downloadable PDF in my opinion

902
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
But also Mighty No. 9 came with Mighty No. 9

903
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
So you know you have that too

904
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Stop

905
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Yeah you know the thing with the physical releases on Switch though

906
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
As cool as that is

907
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
A lot of them are coming way after the game is released

908
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
And it's not like I don't ever buy digital games

909
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Like sure I buy $20 indie games on Switch

910
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
On PlayStation and so forth

911
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Sure I buy those but that's because they're $20 games

912
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
They're not $60 games that I might want to sell

913
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
And try to get like $15 of it back someday

914
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I don't know

915
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Other comments

916
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
JD in our Discord saying

917
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I prefer digital but I'll buy whatever's cheaper

918
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Unless there's a strong reason for one or the other

919
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I like digital because you can't lose the cartridge

920
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
And stuff tied to your account is good for data recovery

921
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
But now that we have two Switches

922
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Being able to pass a cartridge back and forth

923
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Means my husband can play games without buying a second copy

924
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
And Tigerclaw over on Discord said

925
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Most people prefer physical

926
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Well that's

927
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
That may not be what EA's telling us but anyway

928
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Because digital has its limitations

929
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Such as you running out of hard drive space

930
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Or when a digital game is removed from the store

931
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Which would prevent you from ever buying it

932
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Oh that's true

933
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Bringing up the point of delisting of games

934
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Like the PT demo

935
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
You can't

936
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I mean that's different because you didn't buy that

937
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
But I bet a lot of people would have bought that

938
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
But anyway you can't get that anymore

939
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Right

940
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
So you know there's certain things that get delisted

941
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
You know Microsoft has this a lot

942
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Rock band songs get delisted

943
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
You know and that's just part of the rights

944
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Or whatever goes with that

945
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Anyway thanks you guys over on Discord

946
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
vognetwork.com slash Discord

947
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Let's see going to some other comments in our chat

948
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Over at live.vognetwork.com

949
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Ragenator says

950
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
With me being a PC gamer for five years now

951
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I'm pretty damn good at finding all the sales and deals

952
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Right Rob?

953
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Yeah I mean obviously you call into the show a lot with those deals

954
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
But again and I've said this a lot

955
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I don't mean to sound like a broken record

956
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
But this is my perspective on this

957
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Is that when you buy a cartridge or something

958
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Now you have something that has value

959
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
And sometimes that value goes way up

960
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Like Dark Sakura's copy of what is it?

961
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Like Symphony of the Night on Saturn or something

962
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
What's one of those games that goes up in value?

963
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Yeah that one might be it

964
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
The more you own it

965
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Right

966
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Or like you just mentioned your Gorillaz album

967
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
You know went up to so much money

968
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
You know sometimes the value may go up

969
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
If you are lucky enough to own a copy of

970
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Fucking what is it like Chrono Trigger on a cartridge still

971
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
That's still worth a lot of money right?

972
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
So there's that

973
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Or Final Fight Guy

974
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
There's the value in your game

975
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Ninja Gaiden Trilogy

976
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
But if the game is cheap enough

977
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Where you're like

978
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Eh I don't need any return on this investment

979
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I'm good spending five bucks to get a copy of Civ IV

980
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
And all the expansions on a Steam sale

981
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Then for that that's kind of worth it to most people

982
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Because you know you're getting a game

983
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
That's probably worth much more than that

984
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
So you're not looking at the resale value

985
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
It's a big reason why I think humble bundles

986
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Have done so well right?

987
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
So

988
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Probably

989
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Anyway thank you

990
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Dungeon Buster naming some of the big collector's items

991
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I'm trying to think of

992
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Panzer Dragoon Saga

993
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Have it

994
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Silver Gun

995
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Black Label Final Fantasy VII

996
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Have it

997
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
So

998
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,000
And I actually traded my original US Dragon Ball GT Final Bout

999
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
For

1000
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
What was that game?

1001
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Blue Stinger

1002
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
And you know what?

1003
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
It really isn't worth all that much money anymore

1004
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Magical Chase is worth some money

1005
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Because it was the last US Turbo Duo game

1006
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
And just to be fair

1007
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Kaijuto in chat says

1008
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I don't collect Funko but I still love them

1009
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
I love watching how happy people get on YouTube

1010
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
When they find their pops fine

1011
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I didn't mean to crap on your fandom

1012
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
If you love your Funko Pops and more power to you

1013
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Just

1014
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Every store you guys

1015
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Have you been to them all lately?

1016
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
They're in like every store

1017
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
They have a whole bunch half off at Barnes and Noble

1018
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Yeah I guess that's true

1019
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I guess people are buying them for reasons

1020
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
SSJ 100 Matt pointed it out

1021
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Dragon Ball GT Final Bout went down way when they re-released it

1022
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
So it's

1023
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I mean

1024
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
One of the games that never lost any value

1025
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Was Rondo of Blood

1026
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Uh

1027
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Uh

1028
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Dracula X Rondo of Blood

1029
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Didn't Sweet Coat and Two kind of fall in value

1030
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
When they finally put it out on Playstation 3?

1031
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I think maybe a little bit

1032
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
But um

1033
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
A little but not a lot

1034
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
But I mean um

1035
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
You know

1036
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
If anyone wants to give me $500

1037
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
By the way you can have a copy of Ninja Gaiden Trilogy

1038
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Just saying

1039
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
In the box

1040
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
You've been trying to get rid of that for like a year

1041
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
We just didn't put it on eBay again

1042
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Alright

1043
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
We could probably get money for it

1044
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I mean we could at least get $350 for it I'm sure

1045
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Alright

1046
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Well ok we've had enough talk about the digital distribution

1047
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Is that

1048
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Well let me just quickly

1049
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Let me just quickly kind of ask this question

1050
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Cause I asked this to Discord

1051
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
In five years

1052
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Where are we at with digital distribution

1053
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Is it 100% of the industry

1054
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Is it 80% of the industry

1055
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Just quickly let me go around the room

1056
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Where is this industry at in five years of digital distribution

1057
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Loki?

1058
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
60%

1059
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
That seems very conservative

1060
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Yeah

1061
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Ok

1062
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
I'm gonna go with 75

1063
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
75%

1064
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Uh I

1065
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
That's not accounting then for the 25%

1066
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
That'll be pretty much all collector's items

1067
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Collector's editions

1068
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
This is not where I want it to be

1069
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
But I'm gonna say 90%

1070
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
With the 10% being collector's edition

1071
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
The vinyls of video games basically

1072
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I think that we're gonna though see

1073
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
A good number of like actual

1074
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Brick and mortar stores going

1075
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Because it's all gonna be online

1076
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
I think GameStop's in big trouble

1077
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I really do

1078
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
GameStop is gonna go the way

1079
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
If they don't change their business model

1080
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
They're gonna go exactly the way that like our blockbusters did

1081
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
And all that

1082
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Because digital really is

1083
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
And on top of that you know it's really

1084
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I think

1085
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
What's a good word

1086
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Attractive for the manufacturers

1087
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Because that's less in materials they have to pay

1088
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Less labor they have to pay

1089
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Less in shipping

1090
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
They can put that money into advertising

1091
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
And for digital content instead

1092
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
And actually throttle

1093
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
The sales of it if they run

1094
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
You know hit a particular license number

1095
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
All they have to do is just

1096
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Generate more licenses for it

1097
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
So they're not the supply

1098
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Will always be there to meet the demand

1099
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Alright

1100
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Alright we'll

1101
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
We'll probably dive into this topic again

1102
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I think this is something that is gonna be following

1103
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Our industry for a little while if you want to say something

1104
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
And if you want to no longer participate at

1105
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Orangelaunchradio.com

1106
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
In the meantime we're gonna talk about our gaming weeks

1107
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Because really it's been two weeks since we've been here

1108
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
So let's talk a little bit about some of the games we've been

1109
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Playing this week

1110
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Some of the notable highlights

1111
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
DarkSakura what have you been playing this week?

1112
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Idol Poring

1113
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Pokemon Go

1114
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
You know

1115
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Me Tomo

1116
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I started Dragon Age Inquisition again

1117
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Because I fucking love that game

1118
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
In fact my

1119
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Dragon Age fire got lit under me

1120
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
By a dragon

1121
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Also

1122
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Crap what else was I playing

1123
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
A little bit of Ragnarok online

1124
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
And then I

1125
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
I got a Switch

1126
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
And three games

1127
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I acquired it

1128
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Now this is interesting because when I saw this on your Facebook

1129
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Which by the way I still need to like add you on Switch

1130
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
I figured you would have just found me through the 3DS connection

1131
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Dan played it more than me already

1132
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Well I had each other eventually but

1133
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
I assumed you bought one

1134
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
My assumption was

1135
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Oh Mario Odyssey broke them

1136
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
They finally got a Switch but you won it

1137
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I wasn't really supposed to say much about that

1138
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Oh sorry

1139
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
But since no one knows where I work

1140
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
So I did win it in a raffle

1141
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I was keeping it off

1142
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Social media for a reason

1143
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Oh sorry about that

1144
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Because some people do know where I work

1145
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I was in the raffle

1146
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
They were doing cupcakes

1147
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
At work

1148
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
And I said you know what

1149
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I don't want a cupcake

1150
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Well I wanted a cupcake but I was being good

1151
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
And I put my name in the raffle

1152
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
One ticket in the raffle

1153
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Next thing I know look what you got

1154
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Wow

1155
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
So I have a Switch

1156
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I had a Joy-Con with it in three games

1157
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
There's no shame in that for the record

1158
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
This is very common for any corporation to do

1159
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
So you know this is common

1160
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
But I still

1161
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Fair enough

1162
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
So yeah

1163
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I have Arms, I have Breath of the Wild

1164
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
And I have Mario Kart 8

1165
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
And we are gonna put in our order

1166
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
For Odyssey

1167
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Coming up

1168
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
And it's been fun

1169
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
But Dan decided he was gonna

1170
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Take over and play through Mario Kart 8

1171
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
And then he got the demo for

1172
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Puyo Puyo Tetris

1173
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Because one of the things is that

1174
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I still

1175
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
I read Japanese like maybe a semi-literate

1176
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Five year old

1177
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
So going through Puyo Puyo Tetris

1178
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
On PS4 was an adventure

1179
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
And we eventually

1180
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Figured it out to where we could play against each other

1181
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
And all that but Dan's like I can play it in English

1182
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Now meh

1183
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
So here's the beauty of

1184
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
A cartridge based world do you wanna just borrow my

1185
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Copy cause I rarely play it

1186
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Yeah if you guys really wanna play it just borrow my copy

1187
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Bring it back

1188
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
This is like totally Playstation 4 type stuff here

1189
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
You mean I can swap games without having to switch

1190
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Codes and being part of my family network

1191
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
O M G

1192
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Yeah thank you

1193
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
You're welcome

1194
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
That'll be my makeup for Blabbing

1195
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Okay

1196
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
But at any rate

1197
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
It's been

1198
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
It's been fun, the setup was super easy

1199
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
I actually

1200
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
I forgot my password but I could change it through Miitomo

1201
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Because it's linked to my Nintendo account

1202
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
So it was pretty cool

1203
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I just put the picture up

1204
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Got requests already and I was like hey

1205
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
This is sweet

1206
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
So I've been having

1207
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
We played a little bit of it but that means that I'm gonna start Breath of the Wild on my own

1208
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
And not play over Dan's game which is on Wii U

1209
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Nice

1210
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
So we have two copies of the same game on different systems

1211
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
But it'll be interesting

1212
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Now you kind of spot those little differences maybe

1213
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Probably won't be much in the way of differences

1214
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Cause I don't think the Switch

1215
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Is that much more graphically

1216
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Advanced than the Wii U was

1217
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I don't think so either

1218
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
I think

1219
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Everything looked really pretty though on our TV

1220
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Cause we have a 4K TV

1221
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
And it was all clean and pretty

1222
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
But Switch is only outputting

1223
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
A 1080 top

1224
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
It's all about using the emulator

1225
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
To play that game

1226
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Cause then you can output some really good graphics

1227
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
I did however

1228
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Look into the Breath of the Wild emulator

1229
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
That they've got out there

1230
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Basically it's a Wii U emulator

1231
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
But tweaked for Breath of the Wild

1232
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
And so I've seen

1233
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
I've actually gone on this kind of thing

1234
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
For looking to see how the world was built

1235
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Cause I'm very interested in stuff like that

1236
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
I mean you remember me in World of Warcraft

1237
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
When we'd go do something and I'd stay in the instance

1238
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
To just explore

1239
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
You like to go do screenshots and stuff

1240
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
You were big on that I remember

1241
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Well I haven't figured out how to do anything like that

1242
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
In Final Fantasy XIV

1243
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
I actually got my account fixed

1244
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Once I decide if I want to get the collector's edition

1245
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
For Stormblood

1246
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Cause that's still $60

1247
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
And I've got drag queens coming up

1248
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Hey

1249
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I'm buying both mine and Becky's tickets

1250
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
I've got to pay her back for them

1251
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
That's coming up in like two weeks

1252
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
It is

1253
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
And that weekend will be after

1254
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
I have

1255
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Oh I'm not talking about that on the show either

1256
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
More secrets

1257
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
This one's a big secret but you know what it is

1258
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
I think so yeah

1259
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Anything else for your gaming week?

1260
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
I like

1261
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Cheese

1262
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Loki how was your gaming week?

1263
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
I didn't play anything that I said I was going to play

1264
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
What?

1265
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
I know I got lazy

1266
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Oh well

1267
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
I did end up playing a little bit of Minecraft

1268
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
On Windows 10 the other day

1269
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Just to check out I really haven't played that in a long time

1270
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
So it was a little bit different

1271
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
And then

1272
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
What else

1273
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
I played some more of the stupid

1274
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Idol clicker game

1275
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
For office space

1276
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Just because it's the thing to do

1277
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
And

1278
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
I

1279
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Don't think there's

1280
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Much else it was mostly updates

1281
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
I had got everything cause I was gonna

1282
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
I wanted to play VR and I was actually gonna go do that

1283
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
The other day I had everything set up

1284
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
And then all my controllers

1285
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Were dead

1286
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
So I was like god dammit

1287
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
So I finally charged everything but I still never

1288
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Got around to actually playing it again

1289
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
But I have everything ready to go now

1290
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
So I can bust out some VR games

1291
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
From the PlayStation VR

1292
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Hopefully very soon and get all that stuff out of the way

1293
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Cause I have like 4 or 5 games that I've purchased

1294
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
That I've been meaning to actually get to

1295
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
But I haven't gotten to yet

1296
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
So there's that and then

1297
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
What else

1298
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Just reinstall some games on Steam

1299
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Cause it's gonna go play through some of that

1300
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Backlog stuff finally cause there's stuff on there

1301
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
I'm like oh shit I forgot I have that

1302
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
So yeah that's it

1303
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Alright my gaming week I have a lot

1304
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
To catch up on so I was

1305
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
A bit of a sheep I guess some of you want to call me

1306
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
And I got an iPhone 10

1307
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
But before you bring the sheep

1308
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Emojis at me here's the thing

1309
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
I use my phone more than any other device

1310
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
And the phone I was using

1311
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Was 3 years old so you know what

1312
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
I'm worth it I earned it

1313
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Treat yo self

1314
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Exactly treat yo self

1315
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
And it is a nice piece of hardware

1316
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
So I'm a fan so far

1317
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
I think the animojis are kinda dumb

1318
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
But Jamie did laugh

1319
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
When I sent her the unicorn talking

1320
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
I finally listened to it when I got home

1321
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Cause I was at work

1322
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
But it popped up on

1323
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
You know I'm looking at my messenger right now

1324
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
And it pops up on my

1325
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Mac

1326
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
And it actually saves them as little movies

1327
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
So I can quite literally drag

1328
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
It out to my desktop

1329
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Like I could with all of those Retsuko stickers I got

1330
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
That's how I put one on Twitter

1331
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
I sent it to

1332
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Alan even though he doesn't have an iPhone

1333
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
I sent it to him and it just sent him a video

1334
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
But I saved it to my own phone

1335
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
And then I posted it to Twitter

1336
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
I posted something stupid on Twitter

1337
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Why can't you just directly share those

1338
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
To social media

1339
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Apple?

1340
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
You might be able to I just didn't look into it

1341
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
But the animoji isn't a separate program

1342
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
It's built into the messenger

1343
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
But if you're using SMS

1344
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
It converts it to a video format

1345
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
I did not buy the phone to be a talking unicorn

1346
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
And yes I picked the unicorn

1347
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Because everybody else is picking the poop

1348
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Which is stupid

1349
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
So I'm the unicorn which is awesome

1350
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
And the first thing that comes out of this unicorn

1351
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Hey girl

1352
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
I'm like

1353
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Oh Rob

1354
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Eyes detected

1355
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
So anyway I've been playing more

1356
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Pokemon Go on that

1357
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Because it runs so good

1358
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
And as a congratulations on your

1359
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Dumb new phone gift

1360
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Alan got me a gotcha

1361
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Which is like the Pokemon Go Plus

1362
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
But you don't even have to push the fucking button

1363
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
You just walk

1364
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
And it plays the game for you

1365
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Which is awesome

1366
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Yes it's so easy

1367
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
It's just you know

1368
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
My Apple Watch will do that

1369
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
But you don't even

1370
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Like do you have to tap the Apple Watch

1371
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
I haven't honestly played with my Apple Watch

1372
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
You used to have to tap it

1373
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
But I think you can do a setting on it now

1374
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
But the thing that I like about having Pokemon Go

1375
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
On my Apple Watch though

1376
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Is that I don't have to have my phone out

1377
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
You know just walk around

1378
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Kossin in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says

1379
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
My computer is over 9 years old

1380
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Guess that means I should buy an AMD Vega

1381
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Sure go for it

1382
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
If you can afford it do it

1383
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Slay mama

1384
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Like

1385
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
If you're surprised that that's my answer

1386
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Then maybe you don't understand why I got the phone

1387
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Enabler, enabler

1388
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
SSG100 Matt says

1389
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
I was gonna ask how fast does Pogo

1390
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Play on the X

1391
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
I feel like it's the way it's supposed to be

1392
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
I can't help but say X

1393
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Anyway, Mortal Kombat

1394
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Mortal Kombat ruined it for me

1395
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
All right fancy ruined it for you

1396
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
You can help it

1397
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
All right anyway

1398
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
So anyway other stuff I've been playing

1399
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Not just on the new phone

1400
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
I have been playing

1401
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
More Heroes of the Storm

1402
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Like that is like my online game right now

1403
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
I am still playing a crap ton of Heroes of the Storm

1404
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
I'll play it with you, I love that game

1405
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
I suck at it

1406
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Like 90% of what I play is AI

1407
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Just to do my quest

1408
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
But I will say I finally

1409
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Just like sucked it up

1410
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
And I was like okay I'm getting pretty good with

1411
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Morales who's a healer character

1412
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
I'm feeling like I got a good energy

1413
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
With her, I got MVP in a game

1414
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
So I was like I'm gonna try a real game with Morales

1415
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
And I did and I went in the real game

1416
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
And we won and

1417
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
The toxic Heroes of the Storm community

1418
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Even complimented me on my healing

1419
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
So now my ego is like

1420
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Woo I can do this

1421
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
I'm gonna be a Heroes of the Storm champion

1422
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Cause I'm the Morales king

1423
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
So now I'm playing more online

1424
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
So yeah

1425
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
I'm playing a little bit more

1426
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
I'll do the quest to kind of screw around

1427
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
With other characters and stuff

1428
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
But then if I'm gonna play a hero I'm really comfortable with

1429
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
I have been doing more quick matches

1430
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
So that's been a little bit of that

1431
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
But I wanna talk about new games I've been playing

1432
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
So I didn't get to talk about them last week

1433
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
So now I can talk about them this week after I've played them more

1434
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
I've been playing Destiny 2 on PC

1435
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
So I bought that

1436
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
And I started playing that when it came out

1437
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
And I gotta tell you guys

1438
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
The game is gorgeous

1439
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
It looks so good

1440
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Now I'm not able to play 4K's

1441
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
I didn't buy the AMD Vega

1442
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
That I just told Casa to go buy

1443
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
So I have a video card that's a couple years old

1444
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
So I can't play in 4K

1445
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
But I can play in

1446
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Some resolution that's like 1440

1447
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
So it's a little higher than 1080p

1448
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Just ever so slightly

1449
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
But like

1450
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Isn't that like 2K?

1451
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
I think it might be 2K

1452
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
So yeah

1453
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
And just

1454
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Like the environments in Destiny 2

1455
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Are a lot more varied than they were in the first game

1456
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
So I just, yeah

1457
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
The game looks awesome

1458
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
But it's fun to play too

1459
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
I'm not usually huge on first person shooters

1460
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
But with Destiny being a little bit more like

1461
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
I don't wanna say RPG-ish

1462
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
But that's kinda how it feels when you have quests

1463
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
And the fact that people can drop in and out

1464
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Like your buddy Crystal

1465
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Has been playing matches with me on PC

1466
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
And Crystal will join matches

1467
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
And we'll just go do stuff

1468
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
And then it's like, okay we did a quest

1469
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
I gotta go

1470
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
I like that whole drop in and out

1471
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
That you can help other people type of thing

1472
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
That's really cool

1473
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
And then my buddy Delvin, shout out Video Game Realness

1474
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
My pal over there who hosts that show

1475
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
He was playing with me on some matches as well

1476
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
And we were both swooning over Sniper Daddy

1477
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
So there it is

1478
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
So Destiny, I'm

1479
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Liking way more than I thought I would

1480
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
And again the visuals

1481
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
At least on PC

1482
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
I haven't been playing it on console so I couldn't tell you how it compares

1483
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
But it looks

1484
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
So good on PC

1485
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
But again you wanna make sure you have a video card

1486
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
That can at least handle it

1487
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
But mine's a couple years old and is doing okay

1488
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
And if you're gonna be that guy that goes get that brand new AMD card

1489
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Then hey, I bet 4K is gonna look gorgeous

1490
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
So there you go

1491
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Dungeon Buster in Chat says

1492
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
I've heard a lot of good things about Destiny 2's

1493
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Optimization from PC people

1494
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Yeah, there's no frame rate cap

1495
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
So

1496
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
I probably could play on 4K

1497
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
But my frame rate would be like 20

1498
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
So by dipping it down a little bit

1499
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
I'm able to have a really smooth experience

1500
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
And I really really like it

1501
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
So JD says

1502
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Sniper Daddy, yes

1503
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
I don't wanna give too many spoileries away

1504
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
But in the first area

1505
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
The guy that you kinda turn Quest into

1506
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Is a Sniper Daddy

1507
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
And he's voiced by, here's the thing

1508
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
He's voiced by Gideon Emery

1509
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Who

1510
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Balthier, Fenris

1511
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Yeah, Fenris

1512
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
And the thing is that Gideon Emery

1513
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Never changes his voice

1514
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
For the characters, but there's a reason for that

1515
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Everybody is just fine with the voice

1516
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
That God gave him

1517
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
So there's that

1518
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Just give me a character name so I can Google fan art

1519
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
I don't remember the character's name

1520
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
I've been calling him nothing but Sniper Daddy

1521
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Somebody in chat knows

1522
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
The name

1523
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Help JD and I out

1524
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
I don't remember the name of the character

1525
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
That's kind of embarrassing

1526
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
One other game that I've been playing

1527
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
An awful lot of is

1528
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Not as much as some of my friends

1529
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Cause I haven't beat it yet

1530
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
But I feel like I'm getting really close

1531
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Super Mario Odyssey on the Nintendo Switch

1532
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
I bought that game when it came out

1533
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
And I've been playing quite a bit of Super Mario Odyssey

1534
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
And you guys, I love it

1535
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
It's just like

1536
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
If you don't like Super Mario Odyssey

1537
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
I would really want to know the why

1538
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Because I just feel like

1539
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
There's just so much fun

1540
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
And Super Mario Odyssey

1541
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Just makes me smile

1542
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Now I don't want to spoil too bad

1543
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
But there was one part in the game in particular

1544
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Like everybody knows from the trailers

1545
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
New Donk City, right?

1546
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
So those that have played the game will know

1547
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
That there's a certain moment in the new Donk City

1548
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
When you're playing it

1549
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
A celebration of sorts

1550
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
And everybody that's played the game is going to know what I'm talking about here

1551
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
So like when I was going through that whole sequence

1552
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
I was like

1553
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
This is just

1554
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
This is fucking awesome

1555
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Like there's just

1556
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
This is how playing video games should feel

1557
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
All the time, every time

1558
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
This is a fucking delight

1559
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
What I'm doing right now

1560
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
And I wish every video game felt like this

1561
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
And that's where I'm at with Super Mario Odyssey

1562
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Are there small nitpicky imperfections

1563
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
I could maybe get into about the game?

1564
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Sure, it looks a little

1565
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
I think it looks cheaper when it's off the dock

1566
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Than it does in the dock

1567
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Like I noticed some of the problems and some of the frame rate issue

1568
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
But honestly, it's so fucking minor

1569
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
It doesn't matter because the game

1570
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Is extraordinarily fucking fun

1571
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
And that is like

1572
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
I just love that when I go into a new level

1573
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Like all of a sudden there'll be some

1574
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Dippy new mini game that's so adorable

1575
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
That I'll have to play

1576
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Like I just went to Snow World

1577
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
And the only racing thing you have to do

1578
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Is these fat little walruses

1579
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
That you have to like bounce

1580
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Because you're a fat fucking walrus

1581
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
And you have to bounce around

1582
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
It's so adorable

1583
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
You do like your test cars

1584
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
I do

1585
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Mario Odyssey kind of has their version of that

1586
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
And it's super adorable

1587
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Dark Tetsuya in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says

1588
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Like Breath of the Wild did

1589
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
For the Zelda games

1590
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Yeah, actually Mario Odyssey

1591
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Is a lot like Breath of the Wild

1592
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
In some ways

1593
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Not totally, I mean there's a little more structure to it

1594
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
You go from zone to zone

1595
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
But like the freedom to do whatever you want

1596
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
In those zones

1597
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Or let's look behind this wall

1598
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Because there might be a moon

1599
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
It's just like Mario 64

1600
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
It is, and honestly it's the most Mario 64

1601
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
It's probably the best Mario game since Mario 64

1602
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
And I even thought

1603
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
At the time Mario 64

1604
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Was kind of overrated

1605
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
And that's because I had a very hard time

1606
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Shifting from 3D to 2D

1607
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
And I think a lot of gamers of a certain age

1608
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Kind of went through this

1609
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
So Mario 3D was a little harder for me to get into at the time

1610
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
And believe me guys

1611
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
I loved Mario Sunshine

1612
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
I loved Mario Galaxy

1613
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
I think Mario Galaxy was my game of the year

1614
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
The year that game came out

1615
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Odyssey is even better

1616
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Like this is Mario at the top of his game

1617
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
And I couldn't be happier

1618
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
If you own a Switch

1619
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
You're getting this game done

1620
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Like there's no, is there a debate

1621
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Why would you own a Switch

1622
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
And not own Mario Odyssey

1623
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
I just, I don't know

1624
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
You would have to hate platformers

1625
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Or really only be into it for a certain game or something

1626
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
But just like

1627
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
If you even remotely enjoy Mario games

1628
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Mario Odyssey is fucking great

1629
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
And I would say

1630
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Go for it

1631
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
So orange right in chat says

1632
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
My entire gaming week was Mario Odyssey

1633
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Are there bushes to hide in in the desert?

1634
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Well that was a question

1635
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
For Dungeon Buster

1636
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
I guess about, oh, hiding

1637
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Being Assassin's Creed-ing across Egypt

1638
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
There are some different kind of

1639
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Mechanics where you can kind of hide in things

1640
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
And parts where 3D turns

1641
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Into 2D and it's really cool

1642
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
And guess what I got today

1643
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
In the mail that I'm really excited to play

1644
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Well in the mail, UPS from Amazon

1645
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
I got my Princess Peach wedding emoji

1646
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
So you know what that means guys

1647
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Mario wedding dress time

1648
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Woohoo

1649
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Dark Sakura

1650
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
It's like rolling her eyes

1651
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Mario drag

1652
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Have you seen the pictures of Mario

1653
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
It's just like

1654
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
How can you hate it

1655
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
It's so funny

1656
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Like cute

1657
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
It's just great

1658
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Those pictures of Mario in a wedding dress

1659
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Running away from a Goomba

1660
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
It's everything that Mario Odyssey

1661
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
I love it

1662
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Alright

1663
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Anyway, Dungeon Buster in chat says

1664
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
I own a Switch but don't have Odyssey

1665
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Yet, well yeah

1666
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
But it's on your agenda

1667
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Like obviously there's gonna be people that are like

1668
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
I don't have the finances for 60 bucks right now

1669
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
But I will by the holidays

1670
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
It's on everybody's radar for sure

1671
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
So there you go

1672
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Alright

1673
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
So yeah, Mario Odyssey

1674
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
My highest recommendation of that game

1675
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
I'm loving it

1676
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
I've had a very good gaming week

1677
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
These are all good games that I'm talking about

1678
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Heroes of the Storm, Destiny 2

1679
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
It's a great fucking time to be a gamer

1680
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Housekeeping

1681
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
I already mentioned we won't be here next week

1682
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
That's a pre-planned night off

1683
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Sorry about that

1684
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Follow us on Twitter

1685
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
You can also do Facebook

1686
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
And Discord

1687
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
So I'll tell you this now

1688
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Stay tuned tonight

1689
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
I thought what a nice apology

1690
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
would be tonight

1691
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Let's do something, and I looked, do you know it's been over

1692
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
a year since we've done this on our show

1693
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
We're gonna bring back a segment

1694
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
that I know you guys love

1695
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
We're gonna have ourselves a list list tonight

1696
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
So stay tuned

1697
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
List list coming up in part B

1698
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
I'll tell you the topic later

1699
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
But it has to do with one of our news stories tonight

1700
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
So I think we need to get into the news

1701
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
So we can get to the list list topic

1702
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Right, Loki? Let's get into

1703
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
the news

1704
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
So let's talk a little bit about it on Paris

1705
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Games Week

1706
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
So they have that big

1707
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
I don't know if you call it a press conference

1708
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
trailer sizzle reel I guess

1709
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Where they showed off a bunch of new things

1710
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
from Sony

1711
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
One of the big IPs they were showing off

1712
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
was actually a game called

1713
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Ghosts of Tsushima

1714
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Which is a brand new game

1715
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
from Sucker Punch

1716
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
And it kind of looks like

1717
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
a Ninja Gaiden just based off the

1718
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
small bit of gameplay that they had

1719
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
But it basically takes place in feudal

1720
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Japan with

1721
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Samurais

1722
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
So it looks pretty cool

1723
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
So that's something I'm definitely wanting to check out

1724
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
whenever that comes out

1725
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
They also showed off

1726
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
some other stuff including

1727
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Let's see

1728
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
They had this game called Erica

1729
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Which is gonna be using that

1730
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
The

1731
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
PlayStation integration, the play link

1732
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
with your phone

1733
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
So basically you can kind of

1734
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
pick, it almost looks like a choose

1735
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
your own adventure type thing

1736
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Where she's trying to figure out some sort of mystery

1737
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
that's going on, try to piece together

1738
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
like a puzzle or something

1739
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Kind of have that quantum

1740
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
or not quantum break, the

1741
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
quadratic dream

1742
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
type look to it

1743
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
but you know, live action and everything

1744
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Interesting

1745
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
I guess, I don't know, not my type of game

1746
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
but it is a neat

1747
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
neat idea to use the phones and everything

1748
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Plus I guess one of the gimmicks of it

1749
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
is you're gonna be able to draw in the world

1750
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
or touch the world, they said

1751
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
So it's gonna be using your touch screen

1752
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Touch the world

1753
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
This game actually looked pretty awesome

1754
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
I feel like that should be a commercial

1755
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
that airs during the Jerry Springer

1756
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
show

1757
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Pick up the phone, touch

1758
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
my world

1759
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
So there's

1760
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
another game called Onrush

1761
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
which is like this off-road

1762
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
racing kind of

1763
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
cross with like

1764
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
burnout type of game

1765
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
So it's a very fast paced, you know

1766
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
smashing the cars and stuff like that

1767
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
games gonna be coming out from Ubisoft

1768
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
on the Playstation 4 and it looks pretty awesome

1769
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
so definitely

1770
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
one I'm willing to pick up since

1771
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
I love me some burnout

1772
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
and then

1773
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
one of the things that they also announced

1774
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
that with the new Monster Hunter World

1775
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
you're actually gonna be able to play as Aloy

1776
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
from Horizon Zero Dawn

1777
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
with the Playstation 4 version

1778
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
so that's kind of neat for fans of that

1779
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
of course they also talked about the expansion

1780
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
that they have for that game

1781
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
then they've gotta

1782
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
please buy Monster Hunter World

1783
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
cause our company's in a lot of trouble

1784
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
we need this game to be a success

1785
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
well

1786
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
I guess, yeah

1787
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
and then of course

1788
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
there's some new Playstation VR titles

1789
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
they had one that kind of looked

1790
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
a little bit like a spinoff of the

1791
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
gangster, like a London gangster

1792
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
thing that they had in Playstation World

1793
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
but it's this

1794
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
game called Blood and Truth

1795
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
and I guess it's just

1796
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
you know, kind of throwing you into like

1797
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
some sort of modern

1798
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
like, I don't even really say it's like

1799
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
gangster, more

1800
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
it might even be like a Mission Impossible type thing

1801
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
or something like that

1802
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
so lots of gunplay and stuff

1803
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
and then

1804
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
what else

1805
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
they had another game that was kind of lame looking

1806
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
though that I was not interested in

1807
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
but lots of VR stuff that they were announcing

1808
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
so that was kind of cool

1809
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
and then finally the last thing they had a game called

1810
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Ore

1811
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
and it came out actually

1812
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
that day when they announced it

1813
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
and it kind of resembles like

1814
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
a

1815
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
game company game

1816
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
they couldn't say made by that game

1817
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
company or anything like that but they could say

1818
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
in the style of Journey and

1819
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Flow brings this new adventure

1820
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
and I heard the reviews were only mediocre

1821
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
I didn't play it myself

1822
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
I hear it didn't play that well but it looks similar

1823
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
to that, you know the same kind of art style

1824
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
which I mean

1825
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Journey was

1826
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
hands down like one of the greatest

1827
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
video gaming experiences of the past

1828
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
ten years, like no question

1829
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Journey is up there, so it's

1830
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
like it's no surprise we're seeing

1831
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
games inspired by Journey

1832
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
because it deserves that

1833
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
It did look kind of neat though because it almost

1834
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
reminded me of a shooter almost

1835
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
it seemed like a lot of bullet dodging and stuff like that

1836
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
so there was that, it's about this boy

1837
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
kind of can transform into this dragon

1838
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
like a Chinese dragon

1839
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
so it was neat

1840
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
I don't know, I would just check out the trailer

1841
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
see if something that you might be interested in

1842
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
check them out but

1843
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
that's pretty much the major stuff that they announced

1844
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
during Paris Game Week

1845
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Interesting that they announced a lot here because

1846
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Sony still has PSX

1847
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
coming up in the early December

1848
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
now I thought I saw some tweet

1849
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
and I don't know if this is you know

1850
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
take tweets with a grain of salt

1851
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
but I heard that Sony shifted

1852
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
some of what they were going to announce at PSX

1853
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
to this

1854
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
so some people are saying lower your expectations

1855
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
for PSX but that

1856
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
seems strange

1857
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
the stuff that we kind of mentioned

1858
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
was just the new stuff but they also had

1859
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
more trailers for different

1860
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
games that have already been announced

1861
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
like God of War had a gameplay trailer

1862
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
they looked alright, they showed

1863
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
the redone intro for

1864
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Shadow of the Colossus

1865
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
that remake

1866
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
which looked pretty gorgeous

1867
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
so do you think PSX is going to focus on

1868
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
here's an update on Final Fantasy 7 remake

1869
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
well they have that

1870
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
they have that other zombie game that's supposed to be

1871
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
coming up that they kind of showed a little bit of

1872
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
before

1873
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
there's still they can do another

1874
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
I think they showed the Last of Us 2

1875
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
trailer as well

1876
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
so they could always do more of that

1877
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
they could show hopefully

1878
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
I'm hoping at this point you know especially since

1879
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
you know their chummy

1880
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
and everything we'll see a new Death Stranding

1881
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
trailer so

1882
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
yeah so maybe I guess you're right all those things they could

1883
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
kind of quote unquote get away with

1884
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
honestly the PSX

1885
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
conference could be three minutes

1886
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
long and a win and all they have

1887
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
to do is come out and say well we know

1888
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
you've been asking for it so we finally

1889
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
changed our mind of backwards compatibility

1890
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
PS1, 2 and 3 games available

1891
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
today have fun like that could be it

1892
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
and everybody would be like fuck yeah PSX

1893
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
was the best year ever

1894
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
old shit is new again

1895
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
they're never going to do that though they're not going to do that until they're in

1896
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
second place it's just frustrating when you're watching

1897
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
like Microsoft over here going

1898
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
we're going to take original Xbox games

1899
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
and make them in 4K and like

1900
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
meanwhile Sony's like

1901
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
they're not thinking they're like thinking well PlayStation 4

1902
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
is so fucking strong and everything

1903
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
right this generation

1904
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
but then you look at like when the new consoles

1905
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
come out and you think hmm you know the PlayStation

1906
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
4 didn't really have all that mod support

1907
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
that I liked that the other one had oh hey

1908
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
you know what those exclusives weren't so great

1909
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
that was it you know

1910
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
those games that I was really like banking

1911
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
on that were going to be really great games maybe

1912
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
I will go back over there and you know

1913
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
do Microsoft instead and that's kind of where

1914
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
it was like this time around because

1915
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
I don't know PlayStation 4 looked like

1916
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
it had some really great exclusives but then some of

1917
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
those games just turn out to be kind of garbage

1918
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
well yeah SSU100Matt in chat says yeah

1919
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
I'm not expecting any blockbuster stuff from PSX

1920
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
show but they like well you

1921
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
you mentioned that Loki Street Fighter

1922
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
5 was a PSX announcement

1923
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
now at the time that was a pretty

1924
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
fucking big deal now obviously the game came

1925
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
out and it's

1926
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
controversial we'll leave it at that they're

1927
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
trying to salvage what they can with that

1928
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
but at the time still the fact that

1929
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Street Fighter 5 was coming and it's

1930
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
PlayStation and PC only

1931
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
and not none for you

1932
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Xbox go home that was a pretty big

1933
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
deal that's the thing about those both those conferences

1934
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
and stuff and like especially these major game

1935
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
announcements are like this console and

1936
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
PC exclusives like fuck yeah

1937
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
I'm a winner on PC woo I can get all of

1938
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
this you know that's kind

1939
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
of like what that's that was that was

1940
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
me Microsoft E3 yeah exactly

1941
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
it's really kind of the big thing that's kind of

1942
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
kept me away from an Xbox one because

1943
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
I don't feel that I need to have a system

1944
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
for these games like man I

1945
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
really want to play Forza wait I have a PC

1946
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
that can run that and they have it on PC

1947
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
so I don't need the buyer console

1948
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
but yeah I you know hope that there's

1949
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
other games that'd be worthwhile but

1950
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
there really is not a lot of

1951
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
exclusives that's why I kind of been just like eh

1952
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
I'm not really jumping in you know

1953
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
to getting multiple consoles right now of course

1954
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
a Switch later because Nintendo's never gonna put stuff

1955
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
on PC although they do

1956
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
be fucking awesome come on

1957
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
emulators eventually

1958
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
well anyway

1959
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
yeah I'm gonna temper my expectations

1960
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
for PSX but I still

1961
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
there'll be a surprise or two there's gonna

1962
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
be some big game they're gonna unveil to get

1963
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
the fans hyped because this is their chance

1964
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
to get things in front of the fans I don't think it's out

1965
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
of the question that maybe we'll get something

1966
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
playable

1967
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
for Final Fantasy 7 remake

1968
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
or for Kingdom Hearts 3

1969
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
like something out of the Square Enix camp

1970
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Kingdom Hearts 3 has got to fucking

1971
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
come out at some point right?

1972
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
yeah I'm like these games are supposed to be coming out

1973
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
some day

1974
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
like I

1975
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
one of those games has to come out 2018

1976
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Crackdown's gotta come out some

1977
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
day I know it's not

1978
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Sony but Jesus Christ man

1979
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
that was gonna be the game that was gonna

1980
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
sell me on that console and now I'm like

1981
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
eh I would think Final Fantasy

1982
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
remake part 1 is coming 2018

1983
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
like because again they split that game

1984
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
into parts and we've already seen

1985
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
the trailers that show that game in motion

1986
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
in Midgar

1987
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
you know some of the opening scenes was like

1988
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
and that was a year ago so

1989
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
I would think we're closer than

1990
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
I mean again

1991
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
I'm not gonna get my hopes that high up

1992
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
but I would think Final Fantasy 7 remake part 1

1993
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
is close

1994
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
I still have to play through 15

1995
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
15 was a game I was really excited for

1996
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
well if you play 15 that's gonna be the same engine

1997
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
that Final Fantasy 7 remake is running in

1998
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
so you'll get an idea what to expect

1999
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
alright

2000
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
S.H.O.N. and Matt in chat says to be clear

2001
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
I'm not expecting any sort of Kingdom Hearts 3

2002
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Shenmue or Final Fantasy 7

2003
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
remake news alright that's

2004
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
don't go in expecting

2005
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
any of that that way if it does show up

2006
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
you'll be pleasantly surprised

2007
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
all C-Man

2008
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
go expecting

2009
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
nothing but C-Man

2010
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
one publisher

2011
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
that won't be showing up at a Nintendo conference

2012
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
anytime soon likely is EA

2013
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
cause EA has mentioned this week

2014
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
you know we're not really in a rush

2015
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
to make more video games for the Nintendo

2016
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Switch you might remember that EA

2017
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
kind of has tested the Nintendo Switch

2018
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
with FIFA 18 being out there

2019
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
on the platform I would assume

2020
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
this game's doing alright but in a

2021
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
recent I guess this was an interview

2022
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
with the Wall Street Journal since we are talking about

2023
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
finances the finance chief

2024
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Blake Jorgensen said

2025
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
that basically

2026
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
they want to wait

2027
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
for the Switch to be on the market a full

2028
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
year before deciding whether

2029
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
to release more games besides

2030
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
just FIFA 18

2031
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
they want to wait to quote

2032
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
fully understand what the demand is

2033
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
for Switch before committing more

2034
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
resources to it

2035
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
it's just cost versus return

2036
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
on creating another engine because

2037
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Frostbite doesn't run on it that's really what it

2038
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
comes down to and I'm guessing that they probably just

2039
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
converted because I still think

2040
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
that they have legacy versions coming out

2041
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 still

2042
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
for FIFA it's one of the few games that they

2043
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
have that still because in certain regions

2044
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
they don't have the newer systems or they're

2045
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
not readily available so that's probably why

2046
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
they converted FIFA is because they have

2047
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
the older engine that they're adapting to

2048
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
it but they're not going to

2049
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
that's why they're waiting it's got to be a

2050
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
runaway success before they want to sink money

2051
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
into it I'm going to tell you what it is cause

2052
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
my husband hit the nail on the head with this

2053
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
first thing out of his mouth he said

2054
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
oh this is because Nintendo is challenged

2055
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
when it comes to online

2056
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
and EA wants that sweet loot box

2057
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
money that's and I was like

2058
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
you're right you're absolutely right

2059
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Nintendo still hasn't unveiled

2060
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
what their full plan for online is

2061
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
that's what's holding EA back

2062
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
I don't think so I think they could still implement

2063
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
loot boxes if they wanted to they have

2064
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
does FIFA 18 have loot boxes? yes

2065
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
they've got the ready

2066
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
they've got the

2067
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
what do they call it?

2068
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
it's like the team thing that they have

2069
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
they've had those loot boxes for FIFA for a long time

2070
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
the player cards or whatever they call them

2071
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
I forget the something team

2072
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
I don't remember what it's called

2073
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
well that's been around forever that's why everybody got their accounts on their Xbox 360

2074
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
or something like that yeah

2075
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
so it's been around forever so they've had

2076
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
they had loot boxes and that type of stuff

2077
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
for the longest time

2078
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
JD in chat says

2079
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
to be honest if EA had any sense

2080
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
they would port Bejeweled to

2081
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Switch yeah I mean

2082
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
EA has that PopCap kind of casual

2083
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
arm is PopCap still open or did

2084
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
EA close it? I think they closed it

2085
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
fuck EA if they did that but I remember

2086
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
PopCap did a lot more of those

2087
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
no because they're still making Plants vs. Zombies

2088
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
and Pagle games

2089
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
I think they're still around but

2090
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
they're not kind of what they used to be

2091
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
under EA which you know

2092
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
but anyway

2093
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
but still I mean

2094
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
you would think that those types of more

2095
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
casual games would do very

2096
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
well on something like Switch

2097
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
oh by the way in a related

2098
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
update the Nintendo Switch

2099
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
has sold 7.6

2100
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
million units

2101
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
doomed for failure

2102
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
total failure

2103
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
7.6 million Switch units

2104
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
as of September 2017

2105
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
already more than half the

2106
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
sales of the Wii U in its

2107
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
entire lifetime

2108
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
this includes 4.7

2109
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
million Zelda Breath of the Wild

2110
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
4.4 Mario Kart 8

2111
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
3.6

2112
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Splatoon 2

2113
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
and speaking of

2114
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
sales Super Mario

2115
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Odyssey 2

2116
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
million copies in 3 days

2117
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
that's per Nintendo's estimate

2118
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
that includes bundles

2119
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
digital sales but

2120
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
still 2 million copies in 3 days

2121
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
there ain't a lot of games pushing

2122
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
numbers like that so it does

2123
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
put an interesting sort of

2124
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
when you put that next to EA's

2125
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
we're gonna wait and see how the Switch does

2126
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
uh ya boners

2127
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
the Switch is doing just fine

2128
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
if you would just figure

2129
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
out what you are gonna put on this system

2130
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
EA doesn't make games like Mario

2131
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Odyssey they don't make good

2132
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
games like that anymore

2133
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
honestly

2134
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
if

2135
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
well no cause they'd have to convert

2136
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
the engine so I guess there's no

2137
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Mass Effect to be had on it

2138
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
what about the original trilogy that could

2139
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
happen you know because there's been tweets

2140
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
out there the N7 day is next

2141
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
week right so and I guess it's the

2142
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
it's 10 years of Mass Effect this year

2143
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
and EA I'm still mad I know

2144
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
well here's my punchline EA put out

2145
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
a tweet that said come join us to celebrate

2146
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
10 years of Mass Effect on November 7

2147
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
so what if they show another

2148
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
trailer for Anthem that day

2149
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
I am gonna riot

2150
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
my reply was

2151
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
if it's not Cory and Arc DLC which we know

2152
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
it's not cause they're putting it on a book

2153
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
or a remaster of the trilogy

2154
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
go party by yourself which is my nice way

2155
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
of saying go fuck yourself

2156
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
after what you did to that franchise

2157
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
so if you're not gonna invest like

2158
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
at least if you're gonna say

2159
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Andromeda done fucked it all up

2160
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
if you're not gonna at least then go back and do

2161
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
the trilogy and remaster that

2162
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
and put that out you know which

2163
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
could hypothetically be on the Switch

2164
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
then you know what

2165
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
that's a party I ain't going to

2166
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
have fun

2167
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
anyhow let's move on to happier news

2168
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Dark Sakura what do you have for us

2169
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
well

2170
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
you know I love my Animal Crossing

2171
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
and I'm looking forward to Animal Crossing Pocket Camp

2172
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
even though I am not going to

2173
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
you know be an idiot and make an

2174
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Australian account just to play it early

2175
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
when I'm going to have it

2176
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
soon anyway

2177
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
but anyway

2178
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
of course it's already

2179
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
been data mined for information

2180
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
put up by CriticalGG

2181
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
and

2182
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
there are

2183
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
I mean it's interesting but not surprising

2184
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
so as a

2185
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
campsite manager you will be able to grow your

2186
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
own plants in the garden

2187
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
and you have to water them

2188
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
I mean that's just mainstays

2189
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
of Animal Crossing

2190
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
really

2191
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
but then you also like buy fertilizer

2192
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
which if I remember correctly came

2193
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
up in New Leaf

2194
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
and then you have

2195
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
soil states normal to dry

2196
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
to withered

2197
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
your other

2198
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
animals can hang out in your gardens

2199
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
and then there's like plant breeding which again

2200
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
they also had with the different you know

2201
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
colors of roses and other

2202
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
plants in New Leaf

2203
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
and then you also

2204
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
are going to have like winter themed locations

2205
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
different things for different seasons

2206
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
different facilities

2207
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
like a school, a shop, a hospital

2208
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
restaurant, office and hotel

2209
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
and that's like more of the stuff from

2210
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
New Leaf so this is really

2211
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
just like it seems to me

2212
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
just like normal

2213
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Animal Crossing but

2214
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
updated for

2215
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
mobile

2216
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
and of course it doesn't necessarily mean that these

2217
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
items are going to be

2218
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
implemented in the game

2219
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
but the thing that's interesting is that there's costumes

2220
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
that are found which again there were costumes

2221
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
in New Leaf and other Animal

2222
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Crossing games but it includes Mario

2223
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Link and Samus

2224
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
so you can get those

2225
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
assets already existed in the other Animal Crossing

2226
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
games I just think it's cool that

2227
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
this is really going to look like it's more

2228
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
like an actual Animal

2229
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Crossing so I'm pretty happy

2230
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
I got to admit

2231
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
like I don't know what it is I don't know if it's just because

2232
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Animal Crossing has not

2233
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
been about collecting virtual console

2234
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
games since the original GameCube release

2235
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
but I'm having a hard time getting

2236
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
excited about it I mean

2237
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
of course I'm going to download it because

2238
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
it's free and of course I'm going to try it

2239
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
and play it and who knows maybe I'll have a good time

2240
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
but like when I watched the

2241
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Nintendo Direct at the end of it I was just

2242
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
kind of meh

2243
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
oh yeah

2244
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
how about something really

2245
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
truly different for Animal Crossing I mean

2246
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
granted they're going to save that for the Switch

2247
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
probably, hopefully, but I just

2248
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
I wasn't that excited

2249
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
I don't know

2250
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
I'm going to play it and I want one for Switch

2251
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
I love my Animal Crossing

2252
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
that's cool

2253
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
with my Switch I can take it to work

2254
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
and play it during my lunch

2255
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
SSJ100Matt says in chat

2256
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
my girlfriend is all over this Animal Crossing mobile game

2257
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
which means I will have to be but I'm like Rob

2258
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
I'm not really feeling it after watching the Direct

2259
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Kaijuto though says Animal Crossing

2260
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
is fun times and JD saying

2261
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
I'm looking forward to the Animal Crossing game

2262
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
it's like the Funko dolls

2263
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
I'm not going to knock you for spending money on

2264
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Animal Crossing have fun with it

2265
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
I like Animal Crossing

2266
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
but for me it's a little

2267
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
stale so maybe

2268
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
the change in setting or maybe some of this other

2269
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
stuff maybe it will make the mobile version

2270
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
more interesting but I'm just

2271
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
I'm not really excited about it

2272
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
although I did have a laugh

2273
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
at the whole Tom Nook on the Cash Money Store

2274
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
because there was a picture

2275
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
like there's pictures of Tom Nook

2276
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
selling the different amounts and the highest

2277
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
amount of like the paper tickets you can buy

2278
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
is like 50 bucks and it shows

2279
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
a picture of Tom Nook swimming in a

2280
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
bathtub full of money and that

2281
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
cracked me up so at least I was like

2282
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
well at least there's a sense of humor about

2283
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
what a disgusting amount of money Nintendo

2284
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
stands to make off this game

2285
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
I like that his icon is one you can have

2286
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
on your Switch

2287
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
oh yeah that's right it is huh

2288
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
I have a little version of my Mii

2289
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
I think doing a little pose

2290
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
that's like hey

2291
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
I want to try my amiibos on it

2292
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
now all my Animal Crossing ones and see if

2293
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
any of them bring anything up

2294
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
in certain games

2295
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
I'm talking about on the actual system

2296
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
where you can use it to make your avatar

2297
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
I don't think the system will do no the system won't do anything

2298
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
but the games will like you can use

2299
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
any amiibo in Breath of the Wild

2300
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
only Zelda related ones do

2301
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
very specific things but the other

2302
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
amiibos will give you coins, random items

2303
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
and Mario Odyssey is a very

2304
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
similar thing like every amiibo

2305
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
will give you something but only certain

2306
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
ones like Bridal Peach will give you

2307
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
something like very specific I wonder if the

2308
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Tom Nook one will take your money

2309
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
it might or if the Resetti one will actually

2310
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
yell at you that would be

2311
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
cool alright

2312
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
let's move on with some more stories

2313
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Loki another big event this past weekend

2314
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
right yes I forgot that BlizzCon was even

2315
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
this weekend but apparently there is

2316
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
lots of announcements from that oh you don't

2317
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
follow the same people I do on Twitter I

2318
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
couldn't avoid it but it's

2319
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
you know what I had a lot of fun when I went in

2320
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
2014 I would love I was

2321
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
a little pissy that Diablo

2322
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
was nowhere to be found and

2323
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
they said it was gonna really not be

2324
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
a BlizzCon I was a little pissy about that but

2325
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
you know I was still

2326
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
I was still living vicariously for my friends

2327
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
who were there it's really about the community

2328
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
at these meetups so

2329
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
they did announce that their

2330
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Overwatch is getting another hero

2331
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
so they have Moira

2332
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
and or Moira

2333
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
I guess Moira

2334
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Moira I believe is correct

2335
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
okay she is

2336
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
a healer and

2337
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
I guess from

2338
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
of course Blackwatch

2339
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
and then they also

2340
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
showed off a new

2341
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
map as well which is kind of neat

2342
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
it's like Blizzard World which I guess

2343
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
is a tribute to different Blizzard games

2344
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
it's like Disneyland

2345
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
it's that China theme park that

2346
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
ripped it all off that was when I was first looking

2347
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
I was like oh they got the last laugh on that

2348
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
didn't they remember the stories about the China

2349
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
theme park that they built around World of Warcraft

2350
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
and shit like that's what it is

2351
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
so I had a good laugh about

2352
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
that I'll just quickly say

2353
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
with the Moira thing too

2354
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
she was completely unexpected because they

2355
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
haven't really dropped any hints about who the character

2356
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
would be so

2357
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Moira kind of came out of nowhere

2358
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
so to speak but they also showed

2359
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
during one of the development panels which I thought was really interesting

2360
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
they showed a ton

2361
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
of concept art for like all

2362
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
these different characters

2363
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
yeah I thought there was a jet pack cat or something

2364
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
there was an

2365
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
it's an illusion to an old

2366
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
kung fu movie but there was an old

2367
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Asian lady with curlers in her hair smoking

2368
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
a cigarette oh yeah from kung fu

2369
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
hustle is that yeah there was a character

2370
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
in Overwatch that looked like that old lady

2371
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
that was awesome

2372
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
that would have been fucking rad

2373
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
jet pack cat in there

2374
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
yeah jet pack cat would be awesome but who knows

2375
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
maybe some of these characters will come out

2376
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
in the future who knows

2377
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
especially if they get good feedback on it because remember the whole

2378
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
Pandarian thing remember that was a big old

2379
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
April Fools joke thing and then all of a sudden

2380
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
that's true

2381
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
this expansion you know because people were fans of it

2382
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
that's true

2383
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
so that was kind of neat and then

2384
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
in non-Overwatch news of course

2385
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
this was something that they've

2386
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
alluded to in the past with shutting down

2387
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
those servers but

2388
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
World of Warcraft classic is finally

2389
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
announced which is going to be basically

2390
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
the vanilla World of Warcraft

2391
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
before you know they added

2392
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
all the expansions ugh all those people are welcome

2393
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
to that shit go

2394
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
have fun everybody

2395
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
I don't miss having to elementally

2396
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
do my weapons

2397
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
or training with my weapon

2398
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
I don't miss that shit

2399
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
they can have it I know everybody that's like

2400
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
back in the day World of Warcraft actually

2401
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
used to be hard you know when they first

2402
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
announced the news I was like why the fuck did

2403
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Blizzard give in to those people why did they give them those

2404
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
people they're going to do all this work

2405
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
building those servers then people are going to be like

2406
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
oh yeah this game sucks

2407
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
what's it's fuck outside Orgrimmar

2408
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
were it was like

2409
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
they divided it into two areas now

2410
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
I've come around on my

2411
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
perspective if that's

2412
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
go build the classic zone

2413
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
get those fucking people out

2414
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
of the game all those people that are like

2415
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
back in my day fine go

2416
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
be here go have fun go have fun

2417
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
in your playground that is not

2418
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
going to be as good as you remember

2419
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
have a blast going to level 40 to get your

2420
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
mount have a great time

2421
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
maybe I'll come back to wow who knows

2422
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
but I wasn't really feeling

2423
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
the rest of the news that they announced Loki

2424
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
yeah so um

2425
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
yeah along with that of course

2426
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
they did announce that if you are

2427
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
you know like most people that do

2428
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
enjoy the expansions they have another

2429
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
expansion coming so they have

2430
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
a horde versus alliance expansion

2431
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
called the battle for

2432
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Azeroth which has a new

2433
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
continent uh Zandalar

2434
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
and new dungeon raids

2435
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
and uncharted

2436
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
islands and

2437
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
I guess um you also have

2438
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
uh you know basically

2439
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
um supporting

2440
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
the you know different alliances

2441
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
in this alliance versus horde war

2442
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
how long

2443
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
have people been talking about having

2444
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
the Zandalar stuff like

2445
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
since vanilla at least

2446
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Lich King when that was really front and center

2447
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
in one particular zone there right

2448
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
so why are they announcing

2449
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
this shit after I've decided to move on

2450
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
that's why they're doing it but I

2451
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
gotta say my I was not

2452
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
I didn't

2453
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
again I was kind of meh at the expansion

2454
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
news I wasn't really feeling it like when they were talking

2455
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
this whole line about we're going back to

2456
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
the war in Warcraft and going back to our roots

2457
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
I'm like you say the same thing every

2458
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
expansion when you introduce

2459
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Mists of Pandaria you said

2460
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
we're going back to horde versus alliance

2461
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
and we all saw how that turned out

2462
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
so forgive

2463
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
me if I give a little side eye to this whole

2464
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
we're going back to our roots uh huh

2465
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
sure Jan honestly I'm

2466
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
tired of the whole horde versus alliance thing

2467
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
I would rather like have

2468
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
a neutral faction

2469
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
horde an alliance fuck party is that

2470
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
something you'd play it'll be called

2471
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
the whoreliance

2472
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
and then

2473
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
finally last but not least they

2474
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
said that Starcraft 2 is going free to play

2475
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
so you can actually

2476
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
on November 14th it will download

2477
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Wings of Liberty

2478
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
the campaign without paying anything

2479
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
and you get access to both single and

2480
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
multiplayer for free

2481
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
that's a pretty big deal for a lot of

2482
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
people that Starcraft will be free but it

2483
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
sounds like it's free but

2484
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
it sounds kinda limited

2485
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
it sounds like you have to buy the expansions if you want

2486
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
those they're just not selling the base game anymore and then

2487
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
apparently if you just have Wings of Liberty

2488
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
they'll also give you the first expansion

2489
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
that's me I only have

2490
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
Wings of Liberty but never really play the game after that

2491
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
so you'll get that at least

2492
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
so that's cool I guess if you want to

2493
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
try it out and of course they have the

2494
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Starcraft

2495
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
remaster that you can check that out too so

2496
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
that's also free

2497
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
you did miss the news for the current Blizzard game I'm all

2498
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
about which is Heroes of the Storm

2499
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
oh yeah so they have more Overwatch characters

2500
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
coming to it? Just one Hanzo

2501
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
which is like the worst Overwatch

2502
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
character I'm sorry but people are gonna disagree

2503
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
with me on that but

2504
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
actually he makes

2505
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
as much as I kinda give him shit in Overwatch

2506
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
he makes a lot of sense for Heroes of the Storm

2507
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
like his abilities especially the dragon

2508
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
thing for a lane game are gonna be great

2509
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
so alright whatever and then Alex

2510
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
Straza looks pretty cool I guess but you know

2511
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
here's the thing with

2512
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
all that Blizzard kind of announces

2513
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
new heroes throughout the year all

2514
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
the time like we just got

2515
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
within the past six weeks

2516
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Ana and Junkrat from Overwatch

2517
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
so the whole reveal

2518
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
of Hanzo and Alex Straza

2519
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
at Blizzcon didn't feel

2520
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
exactly like oooh

2521
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
you know so it's like oh okay this is

2522
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
the next months and they're just doing it on stage at

2523
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
Blizzcon so oh

2524
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
and there's another game Hearthstone

2525
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
they have a new expansion too

2526
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
something about the Hoggers and a silly

2527
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
little theme song that goes with it because there's always

2528
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
some silly little theme song that goes with it

2529
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
so but I don't play a lot of Hearthstone

2530
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
sorry guys but I know some people are super into that

2531
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
so your requisite

2532
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
Blizzcon announcement of a Hearthstone

01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
alright

2535
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
going to chat

2536
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
over at live.vognetwork.com

2537
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
SHO100Matt says wow Hanzo

2538
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
shade you know what

2539
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
let's see Ragenator says if Hanzo was in a valley

2540
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
would he be Hanzo low

2541
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
and shoot first?

2542
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
oh god

2543
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
yes he would

2544
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
no no no because

2545
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
I quit I'm done with this show

2546
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
I quit here's my letter of resignation

2547
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
no no no no Han didn't shoot first

2548
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
Han shot only

2549
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
alright

2550
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
but Han's taking medication to fix that

2551
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
problem so

2552
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
moving on just for that

2553
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
next story oh it's my story god dammit

2554
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
alright

2555
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
just for that we're doing sad

2556
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
news first off for sad news

2557
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
and actually I don't mean to make light of this because

2558
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
this news really does suck runic

2559
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
games has been closed if you don't know them

2560
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
by name you probably know the games they made

2561
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
does EA own them? no

2562
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
actually perfect world owns runic

2563
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
games does EA own them? no

2564
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
torchlight and torchlight 2

2565
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
were the big games that runic made which

2566
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
coming off this news of no diablo

2567
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
news we've seen these other games that

2568
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
kind of come in and you know pick up the slack

2569
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
what was it Grim Dawn's another one that's

2570
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
pretty good I mean that's not runic but you know there's

2571
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
other like diablo clones out there

2572
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
oh path of exiles the other

2573
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
huge one right but anyway sadly

2574
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
torchlight which was pretty good I

2575
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
really enjoyed it runic games has been

2576
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
closed that fucking sucks

2577
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
they also were making a MOBA

2578
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
called gigantic but

2579
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
sadly they have closed

2580
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
runic games which was located in

2581
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
Seattle perfect world

2582
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
in a statement said that that gigantic

2583
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
will quote continue to be available on all

2584
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
our platforms and runic will

2585
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
remain a part of perfect world entertainment's portfolio

2586
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
of studios

2587
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
they also went to say for those

2588
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
that love the torchlight series

2589
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
there will be some news coming that's from

2590
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
runic studio head Marsh Leffler

2591
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
and for all our fans our

2592
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
community and multiplayer services will keep running

2593
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
even after the studio's lights go off

2594
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
you haven't heard the last of us

2595
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
so it makes me think that another developer

2596
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
will be taking the reins for torchlight 3

2597
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
or whatever is next in torchlight's

2598
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
future but sadly a moment

2599
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
of silence for our pals at runic games

2600
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
that's not fun news to talk about

2601
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
also not fun to talk about is

2602
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
house mark apparently says

2603
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
they're no longer going to make arcade games

2604
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
and that means like arcade style games

2605
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
this was in a blog

2606
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
from CEO Larry

2607
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
Quintonen sorry

2608
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
I'm totally mispronouncing that but in this open

2609
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
letter said despite critical success

2610
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
and numerous awards our games just

2611
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
haven't sold in significant numbers

2612
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
are they the ones that did super stardust or something?

2613
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
they are the ones that did super stardust as

2614
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
well as rezogun which were huge

2615
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
titles here's the thing

2616
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
I was like wait a minute didn't house mark

2617
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
have a game that I really wanted to play coming out

2618
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
they did it's next

2619
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
Mashina was the other

2620
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
game that they were doing

2621
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
and actually did you

2622
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
know that next Mashina came out

2623
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
that was that game they showed at E3 that was

2624
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
the big trailer they had with it

2625
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
and Eugene Jarvis was a part

2626
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
of this game which is a pretty big deal he was

2627
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
back in the day was he Robotron

2628
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
Defender, Defender was the game that Eugene

2629
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
Jarvis did so

2630
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
it was a big deal that he was partnering up

2631
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
that game came out over the summer

2632
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
I had no

2633
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
idea and I wanted to play that game

2634
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
so

2635
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
I need to go back on my Playstation 4 and

2636
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
get it but can I just say that

2637
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
like you know now granted look

2638
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
this podcast thing is a

2639
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
hobby Twitter isn't everything

2640
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
although it's a lot but I'm just saying like

2641
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
I really liked what I saw at E3

2642
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
I had no

2643
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
idea this game came out already

2644
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
I think

2645
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
that should say something about why the game wasn't selling

2646
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
did

2647
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
you guys know that it came out because

2648
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
I missed it it's also to the Sony

2649
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
storefront that they have their Playstation

2650
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
stores kind of crap I would

2651
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
I would agree with that it's time for it to evolve

2652
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
it needs an evolution it needs a fresh coat of

2653
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
paint I'll give you that

2654
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
because there will be games that I know

2655
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
like are coming out like for example there was

2656
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
that Megaton Rainfall game

2657
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
that I was looking forward to

2658
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
and it was supposed to come out on a certain day

2659
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
and it was like only a couple days away from it and it wasn't on the storefront

2660
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
anywhere I was like okay well shit you know I was

2661
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
gonna market for download or pre-purchase or something

2662
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
like that and it wasn't there and all of a sudden like

2663
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
oh yeah it's up now and it's like

2664
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
okay well there's the store page but like

2665
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
all these other games have like coming soon pages

2666
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
and everything where's all this shit

2667
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
well now and I do want to clarify Housemark

2668
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
hasn't announced that they're closing they're just

2669
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
announcing that they're making different games

2670
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
now so that's fine I mean well that's

2671
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
fine if a company wants to branch out and do different games but

2672
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
honestly the shocking part

2673
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
of that story honest to god for me and maybe

2674
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
I was just in the dark or playing something else

2675
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
the most shocking part of that story was that that game came out

2676
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
and I had no idea

2677
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
oops I guess I'm part of the problem

2678
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
Kaijuto said it was

2679
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
all over the PSVR store page it was a

2680
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
PSVR game?

2681
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
I had no idea

2682
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
it was a VR game?

2683
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
I didn't know that

2684
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
I figured since they kept talking about

2685
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
Robotron and name checking Eugene Jarvis

2686
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
I figured it was kind of like a modern version of Robotron

2687
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
with some awesome Tron

2688
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
looking music and stages and stuff

2689
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
that's and I was here for that so

2690
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
I had no idea it was a VR game

2691
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
oh boy

2692
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
alright well good luck to Housemark

2693
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
with their future development and

2694
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
promotion of the things that they put out

2695
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
that's for sure so

2696
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
anyway and Dark Tetsuya confirming

2697
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
yeah it is oh I mean it's like

2698
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
Robotron alright well Dark Tetsuya

2699
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
Dark Tetsuya figured out that that

2700
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
game came out I somehow missed that

2701
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
sorry about that oops I killed

2702
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
that franchise sorry guys

2703
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
Dark Sakura what do you have for us?

2704
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
treasure

2705
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
buried treasure? no my favorite

2706
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
no treasure like Radiant Silver Gun

2707
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
and Ikaruga well that's pretty cool too

2708
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
Gunstar Heroes

2709
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
so there was a rumor

2710
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
that treasure was going to stop making new

2711
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
games but

2712
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
no

2713
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
the last new game that they

2714
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
did was Geist Crusher God that came out in

2715
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
2014

2716
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
anyway

2717
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
the rumor was that

2718
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
they were going to go as an IP holding company

2719
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
but their president

2720
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
Mayagawa Masato said

2721
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
that they have an announcement

2722
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
coming out in 2018 and

2723
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
that treasure is not going to make social

2724
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
games as long as he lives

2725
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
the quote I'll never work on

2726
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
social games for as long as I live

2727
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
I'll have something to share next

2728
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
year somebody's taking

2729
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
a stand somebody has had it officially

2730
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
right?

2731
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
but anyway he also

2732
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
was complaining

2733
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
about the lack of communication

2734
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
at Sega when they were working

2735
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
on Mega Drive games especially when they were working

2736
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
on Yu Yu Hakusho and

2737
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
they said Gunstar Heroes shipped

2738
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
70,000 units in Japan and

2739
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
200,000 abroad and that the

2740
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
the

2741
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
first run of it in

2742
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
Japan ran out really quickly he also wishes

2743
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
that Sega would do a

2744
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
Mega Drive mini like what Nintendo

2745
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
is doing and not licensed out by a third

2746
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
party so that it actually is the right

2747
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
you know

2748
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
hardware to run the games

2749
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
so

2750
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
anyway

2751
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
we've got some things

2752
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
here from Treasure from next year that's going to be pretty

2753
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
exciting I love Treasure

2754
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
would you like a Dreamcast mini

2755
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
or like a... Dude a Dreamcast

2756
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
mini would be rad

2757
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
of course how

2758
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
many you know

2759
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
burned GD-ROMs

2760
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
do we have

2761
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
in existence?

2762
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
how many times how many of us

2763
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
own

2764
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
have a copy of

2765
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
Mario Brothers or Super Mario Brothers

2766
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
and ROMs and stuff everybody does but it doesn't mean

2767
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
they're not going to buy the system

2768
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
I'd buy a Dreamcast mini

2769
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
oh hell yeah I'd buy a Dreamcast mini

2770
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
especially if they put PSO

2771
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
again on it you know I don't know

2772
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
how that would work but I would be here for that

2773
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
who cares this is fantasy world that we're talking

2774
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
fantasy zone

2775
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
I don't think it's in our

2776
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
show role at all but PSO2

2777
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
is getting like some neat skins

2778
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
like I tend to leave

2779
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
that stuff out because it just causes me pain

2780
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
well I mean there's

2781
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
but like they're supposed to be getting

2782
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
um

2783
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
oh god what was it like

2784
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
one of the Shining games

2785
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
skins for that

2786
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
and uh virtual on

2787
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
so that may be enough

2788
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
to make me re-download it

2789
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
alright just a few more stories

2790
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
before we get to the classic system of the month

2791
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
but first Loki

2792
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
yes so Call of Duty World War 2

2793
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
finally came out and

2794
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
there's of course

2795
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
controversy

2796
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
uh well first off

2797
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
you know they have the controversy that

2798
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
for some stupid reason

2799
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
they have Trevor T. Martin

2800
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
actually

2801
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
promoting the game

2802
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
and he was best known

2803
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
for violating

2804
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
Federal Trade Commission regulations

2805
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
by owning a

2806
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
Counter Strike skin gambling

2807
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
site and not

2808
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
disclosing that so

2809
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
he's apparently doing I guess

2810
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
a race of prestige

2811
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
fundraiser type thing

2812
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
I don't know I think it's

2813
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
dumb but all the more reason

2814
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
not to really give a shit about this

2815
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
um one of the big things

2816
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
though that's kind of annoying though and remember

2817
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
we talked about this whole

2818
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
um patent that

2819
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
Activision had done

2820
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
and they said no we're not using this patent

2821
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
in Destiny 2 or whatever about

2822
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
loot boxes and basically

2823
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
finding ways to get people you know

2824
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
oh exposed to loot boxes

2825
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
and you know manipulating people

2826
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
in certain ways guess what

2827
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
Call of Duty World War 2 has

2828
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
it's not in Destiny

2829
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
it's not in Destiny but guess what it has

2830
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
it has fucking loot boxes

2831
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
because I know when people are in

2832
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
World War 2 loot boxes fell from the

2833
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
fucking heavens and you know

2834
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
there's literally like achievements

2835
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
and goals in the game to watch people because

2836
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
when people get there's like a social area

2837
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
first off so the beach of Normandy is a

2838
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
social area so many things are wrong

2839
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
with that in the first place wow

2840
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
so wow there's that

2841
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
and then apparently as

2842
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
you're doing that when you get loot boxes

2843
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
other players can see them drop from

2844
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
the sky and see what cool shit you

2845
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
got as like some sort of

2846
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
subliminal way to say oh maybe you should

2847
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
purchase some fucking loot boxes

2848
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
like a certain patent that a certain company

2849
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
made that said oh don't worry

2850
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
it's not evil we're just thinking

2851
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
about ideas except we're totally gonna do this

2852
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
in the next Call of Duty what you're describing

2853
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
is like a parody

2854
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
of what gaming has become

2855
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
but it's fucking real

2856
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
yes so

2857
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
on top the social zone

2858
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
of the beach of Normandy

2859
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
yes so yeah

2860
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
they have these socializations

2861
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
what other cool things do they have in

2862
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
there as well well apparently

2863
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
you can also

2864
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
uhhhh

2865
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
play Pitfall

2866
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
well I do like Pitfall

2867
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
who doesn't like Pitfall but yes you can play

2868
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
Pitfall 2 even

2869
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
better I love Pitfall 2 I think you actually

2870
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
have to purchase some of these so

2871
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
yeah they have a rest and relaxation thing

2872
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
so they have

2873
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
it's a fucking loot box isn't it you have to purchase

2874
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
them with in game money or whatever

2875
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
but they've got and I don't know

2876
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
if it's per play

2877
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
but apparently you can go to

2878
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
an R&R tent and they have Pitfall 2

2879
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
Grand Prix, Fishing Derby

2880
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
Enduro, Kaboom

2881
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
River Raid

2882
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
okay so all the old 2600 Activision

2883
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
yes all the old Activision

2884
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
games which is all on those

2885
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
Flashback consoles because Flashbacks

2886
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
are on version 8 this year

2887
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
and the big thing that they got was

2888
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
Activision licenses so like all those

2889
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
exact same games you just named are on those

2890
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
Flashback 8 consoles

2891
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
yeah just except

2892
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
I don't think Pitfall 2 is in it but Pitfall 1

2893
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
is

2894
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
so it's just

2895
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
something that they have in this part of this hub

2896
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
now

2897
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
alrighty

2898
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
to register participation for this

2899
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
week's episode of Orange Island Radio at

2900
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
vognetwork.com use the passphrase

2901
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
home

2902
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
so yeah well look I'm all for

2903
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
classic games being available and all this stuff

2904
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
but if they charge you per play

2905
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
that's a little silly I don't think

2906
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
I don't think they're charging probably per play

2907
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
doesn't specifically state that that would be

2908
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
kind of lame because who would do that

2909
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
but they're like you know it

2910
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
doesn't look like it's that much currency it's like

2911
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
10 currency or something like that

2912
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
10 whatever loot

2913
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
I don't know what the fuck they're

2914
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
10 lootie points

2915
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
10 looties

2916
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
are

2917
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
you found the lootie

2918
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
alright and one more story

2919
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
for you before we get to the classic game of the week

2920
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
and it's about the video game

2921
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
Just Dance have you played Just Dance

2922
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
recently? no not for several

2923
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
years it's a

2924
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
a franchise I've kind of fallen out of

2925
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
taking the world by storm

2926
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
well apparently it is I mean they still

2927
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
they're still putting them out

2928
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
Just Dance 2018 is out there

2929
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
yeah because they don't have to update their

2930
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
engine or anything they spit them out

2931
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
every year because they still have it coming out on the original Wii

2932
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
so apparently

2933
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
these games are so popular that

2934
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
it's justifying the existence of

2935
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
Just Dance Live

2936
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
that's right

2937
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
4 places in North America

2938
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
if you are one of the lucky residents of

2939
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
Miami, Chicago

2940
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
Houston or Los Angeles

2941
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
guess what Just Dance Live

2942
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
is coming to your town

2943
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
what is Just Dance Live?

2944
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
I don't fucking know because I can't

2945
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
figure it out from the trailer it looks like

2946
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
it's just a kid friendly

2947
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
rave meaning

2948
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
all the glow sticks and none of the ecstasy

2949
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
I think that's what it is

2950
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
um

2951
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
apparently there will be dancers

2952
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
and by the way Just Dance has like

2953
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
degrees as dancers too

2954
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
you can't actually be playing Just Dance without having

2955
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
like a panda bear like a character

2956
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
doing the dances

2957
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
yeah they said there's characters on stage

2958
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
that you follow they're iconic

2959
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
once again Ubisoft misusing

2960
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
the word iconic

2961
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
Just Dance moves

2962
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
girl that panda dance

2963
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
iconic

2964
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
like I'm sure that like you know the

2965
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
iconic moves of like

2966
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
no

2967
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
any of the moves that they do in the game

2968
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
which is iconic I guess

2969
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
colorful characters dancing live on stage

2970
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
you follow along share the thrill

2971
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
with your friends and family

2972
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
pricing from $45

2973
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
to $99

2974
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
for the VIP experience

2975
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
okay to be fair

2976
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
it does sound to me like this is an event

2977
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
for kids like when I say kid friendly

2978
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
rave like there's a half truth

2979
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
to that so

2980
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
Loki this begs the question

2981
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
take your kids to the Just Dance

2982
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
live first off

2983
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
my kids don't know what Just Dance is

2984
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
um so no

2985
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
I would not do that and I was

2986
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
just curious oh my god

2987
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
fucking hell is wrong with these people

2988
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
are you watching the trailer

2989
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
it's pretty late though I mean they've got

2990
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
like you know

2991
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
8.30 it starts at 8.30

2992
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
there's two shows

2993
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
one is late and one is

2994
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
matinee okay so the matinee

2995
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
whatever but like

2996
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
no no

2997
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
no no no alright for the

2998
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
VIP experience

2999
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
for that $99 you get glow up

3000
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
glasses an exclusive

3001
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
drawstring bag and VIP

3002
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
glow laminate and you get an

3003
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
in-game reward for Just Dance and a meet

3004
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
and greet with the cast after the show

3005
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
although I should point out

3006
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
although it's been in many of her music videos

3007
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
Katy Perry is not going to be there

3008
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
at the Just Dance event in fact

3009
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
no actual

3010
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
recording artist that you know from

3011
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
these games except unless there's like an

3012
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
in-house band or something will not

3013
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
be there so you are meeting

3014
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
people

3015
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
that are just dressed up

3016
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
you're meeting costume

3017
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
characters

3018
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
that

3019
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
it's awfully bold of

3020
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
them to assume

3021
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
that this is so big that

3022
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
I

3023
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
I just can't

3024
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
you can't

3025
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
you can't literally

3026
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
let's put this back okay so they have like dancing

3027
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
with the stars and they do live stage

3028
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
performances of that but that you're watching an

3029
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
actual skilled person that like

3030
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
knows how to ballroom dance and that's like

3031
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
that's actually kind of entertaining because you

3032
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
know what C-list celebrities which are

3033
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
you know so you know what you're going

3034
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
into that but this is like

3035
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
it's just people playing

3036
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
the fucking game basically

3037
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
you're watching them and doing the same

3038
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
shit why would I pay

3039
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
$45 to go to an arena

3040
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
to do that

3041
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
even if I was a kid I could think of

3042
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
way better things I'd spend my money on

3043
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
how about a copy of Just Dance

3044
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
come on Noel Gustin our chat

3045
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
over at live.vognetwork.com says

3046
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
Rob if they had an ABBA themed

3047
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
one you'd be there

3048
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
how dare you drag me and

3049
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
read me so accurately in front of our

3050
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
dozens and dozens of listeners how very

3051
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
would you though would you would you seriously

3052
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
go pay they wouldn't be ABBA

3053
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
singing it would just be pre-recorded ABBA music

3054
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
with some dumbasses on stage

3055
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
dancing to it would you pay

3056
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
$45 to watch

3057
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
people dancing to ABBA

3058
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
well see here's the thing here's the thing

3059
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
like I want to say I want

3060
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
to have my pride I want to

3061
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
say no Loki I would not

3062
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
but the reality is

3063
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
I'm pretty sure there actually is a show

3064
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
in Reno where drag queens

3065
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
do ABBA songs but that's drag queens

3066
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
okay that's some talented people this

3067
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
is fucking

3068
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
did our token straight person

3069
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
here on Orange Lounge Radio just

3070
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
say drag queens are more talented

3071
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
than the Just Dance live crew yes because it's

3072
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
fucking this panda bear that I

3073
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
see on my screen I am the

3074
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
proudest gay I am the proudest

3075
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
seriously like there's this the

3076
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
picture that they have of the Just Dance live

3077
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
interactive experience that's

3078
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
quite a bold statement right there

3079
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
you know they have this

3080
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
and sorry

3081
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
for using this word because they use

3082
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
it quite often but sorry fucking

3083
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
retarded looking panda bear it is

3084
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
the most stupid derpy

3085
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
panda bear I have ever seen

3086
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
and don't get me wrong like

3087
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
this would be different if it was like a

3088
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
character that people know but no one's like

3089
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
oh my god I love panda

3090
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
bear from

3091
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
Just Dance yeah I'm totally dressing up

3092
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
on Halloween as panda bear the well

3093
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
known iconic character

3094
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
nobody does that

3095
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
nobody is that into

3096
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
just it's a casual game the only

3097
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
hardcore into a casual game like this

3098
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
the only Just Dance I care about is Lady Gaga

3099
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
uh JD in chat says

3100
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
uh they also have an Abba Just

3101
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
Dance game yeah I'm aware

3102
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
Dark Sakura may have seen me play that

3103
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
I thought that was Singstar Abba no

3104
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
there's both and I may own both there's

3105
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
there's a Singstar Abba Tiara was here for

3106
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
that yes okay so I'm gonna

3107
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
I don't want to talk

3108
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
you love Just Dance

3109
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000

people dancing at home now experience

3111
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
dumb asses on

3112
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
stage okay I'll

3113
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
tell you what this is okay think

3114
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
think back really gonna rant about

3115
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
no no no no no hold on hold on think back

3116
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
to the last few

3117
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
E3s okay think back to

3118
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
E3s and think back to the Ubisoft

3119
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
conferences okay what is seriously

3120
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
the best part of every Ubisoft title

3121
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
is it I'm surprised

3122
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
you didn't say it's the Just Dance

3123
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
performances because I know every time I see those

3124
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
Just Dance performances on any of those

3125
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
Ubisoft conferences like holy

3126
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
fuck this is stupid and cringy as

3127
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
shit this is what people are paying

3128
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
money to go see why

3129
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
why would you say that

3130
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
well if they say Aisha Tyler's

3131
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
gonna be there now I haven't said I'll

3132
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
tell you what I'm sure that these people

3133
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
that listen to these songs like the artists

3134
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
that sing these songs how about you put that

3135
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
$25 towards a ticket and actually see the real

3136
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
artist go

3137
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
on stage and perform because that's fucking

3138
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
worth spending money on not watching

3139
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
a bunch of nobodies dance to a

3140
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
song that's why you have Just Dance

3141
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
so you can be a bunch of nobodies dancing to

3142
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
a song you don't need to pay money to

3143
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
go to an event to do that calm down

3144
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
Marissa Congusto our

3145
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
our pal we love her in our chat saying

3146
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
dumb asses on stage was rejected

3147
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
by the marketing team

3148
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
alright

3149
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
look we have got to move on

3150
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
but maybe we'll revisit

3151
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
this topic a little later Wink

3152
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
in the meantime we need to get to

3153
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
a segment we do here on the show quite

3154
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
regularly called the classic

3155
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
game of the week except

3156
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
plot twist dark soccer

3157
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
sometimes like it's really a plot

3158
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
11 months and once

3159
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
a month she does the classic system

3160
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
of the month this is the next to last one

3161
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
it is and it's actually not one

3162
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
that wasn't on our original list you

3163
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
changed it I did

3164
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
because this one's pretty fucking awesome

3165
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
alright well that's alright it's your segment you can do whatever the hell

3166
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
you want it's the classic game of the week

3167
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
or this week the classic system of the month

3168
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
as it was known in

3169
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
Japan the

3170
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
X Rokuman Hasen which just sounds

3171
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
so cool this thing allowed

3172
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
the X68000

3173
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
which is a home computer that was made

3174
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
by Sharp it was first released in

3175
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
1987 only in

3176
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
Japan it had

3177
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
first model of 10 megahertz

3178
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
Motorola 68000 CPU

3179
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
one whole meg of ram

3180
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
and no hard drive

3181
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
the last one that came

3182
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
out which was in 1993 had a

3183
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
25 megahertz Motorola

3184
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
68000

3185
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
30 CPU

3186
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
4 meg of ram

3187
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
and an

3188
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
optional 80 megabyte

3189
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
SCSI hard drive it was so SCSI

3190
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
at any rate

3191
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
this was

3192
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
pretty much the thing to have if

3193
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
you liked your Capcom games

3194
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
basically most of the

3195
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
and also you could expand the ram to

3196
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
12 megabytes but it didn't really

3197
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
need more than two for most of the games

3198
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
so anyway it's

3199
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
operating system was called human

3200
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
86000 which was developed

3201
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
by Sharp and

3202
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
actually developed for Sharp by Hudson

3203
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
soft and we know Hudson was

3204
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
actually really big in bed with

3205
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
with

3206
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
NEC at the time

3207
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
oh a lot of questions

3208
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
were just answered this video just got to a segment

3209
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
from Parodius Da

3210
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
which I know is one of your favorites

3211
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
yeah

3212
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
it had really a lot of great games on it

3213
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
it looks really, he said this is

3214
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
93 as he just ended

3215
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
yeah 87 to 93

3216
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
this looks really good for a system of that time

3217
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
well and I picked just basically

3218
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
you know like some of the top 10

3219
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
or top 30 games for my video on it

3220
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
but it also

3221
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
was like a tall tower

3222
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
it was white because

3223
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
apparently I guess light colored

3224
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
systems do well in Japan

3225
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
maybe anyway

3226
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
it also

3227
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
had

3228
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
it would also function as

3229
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
with a cable ready

3230
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
TV set with composite video input

3231
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
it also

3232
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
could

3233
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
the display that came with it I'm sorry

3234
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
would also work for JAMA

3235
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
arcade boards because it had RGB input

3236
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
and a

3237
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
standard resolution refresh timing

3238
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
so pretty good

3239
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
it used

3240
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
a hard disk interface

3241
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
which was the

3242
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
SASI sassy

3243
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
I want to call it

3244
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
that basically

3245
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
the later versions though went with the

3246
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
which was pretty much a standard

3247
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
for a long time and then I guess

3248
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
it got

3249
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
you know replaced by something better

3250
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
it did not support

3251
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
the vfat file name

3252
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
standard that went with windows systems

3253
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
it had an 18.3

3254
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
character file name instead of the 8.3

3255
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
allowed in the fat system

3256
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
so yeah just some

3257
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
background on it but the thing that made this the best

3258
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
the thing that made this the best is

3259
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
because the

3260
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
2000 had very

3261
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
similar hardware

3262
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
to what arcade machines

3263
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
ran at the time and it also

3264
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
was the Capcom CPS

3265
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
system development machine

3266
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
it had different text

3267
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
it could support separate text ram graphic ram

3268
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
and hardware sprites as well

3269
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
it also had Yamaha's

3270
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
basically best synthesizer at the time

3271
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
and it was

3272
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
the thing I mean basically

3273
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
games that were made

3274
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
for this system were

3275
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
Parodius Da as we saw

3276
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
Ghouls and Ghosts, Strider, Final Fight, Alien

3277
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
Syndrome, Street Fighter 2

3278
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
Dash and

3279
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
actually one of the best Castlevania

3280
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
versions the original

3281
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
Akumajo Dracula

3282
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
that was later on ported

3283
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
to Playstation with Castlevania Chronicles

3284
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
Chorensha 68000

3285
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
which basically was

3286
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
ported to Windows later

3287
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
and it

3288
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
really just allowed for

3289
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
beautiful graphics and

3290
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
I mean arcade perfect sound

3291
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
was amazing on it again

3292
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
everything that the system

3293
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
that basically came out on the system

3294
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
was like having an arcade

3295
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
version in your home

3296
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
it really was the one to have

3297
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
I would love to have one if I could find

3298
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
one I mean

3299
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
it'd be fun to hook

3300
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
that up and play different

3301
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
things you know I think it would be

3302
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
the Legend of the Valkyrie we're looking at

3303
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
is it? I missed the name sorry

3304
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
oh well but anyway

3305
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
just to go over

3306
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
a list of a few more of the games that came out

3307
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
on it a couple of little things

3308
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
that people might

3309
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
might recognize is

3310
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
we had After Burner

3311
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
came out on it Alien Syndrome

3312
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
like I said

3313
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
we had

3314
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
Asuka 120% Burning Festival

3315
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
we had Atomic Robo Kid

3316
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
Battle Chess

3317
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
I fucking love Battle Chess by the way

3318
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
a game called Blodia

3319
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
several Bomberman games

3320
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
Bubble Bobble

3321
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
Chase HQ

3322
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
Columns

3323
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
it's a cotton game

3324
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
Cotton Fantastic Night Dreams

3325
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
this system has your name written all over it

3326
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
it's like all your favorite games

3327
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
I'm really surprised you don't have one of these

3328
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
well they're pretty expensive

3329
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
I mean like I said Daimakemura

3330
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
is Ghost and Goblins

3331
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
Daytona Twinbee

3332
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
several Dragon Knight games

3333
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
I'm just going through the list here

3334
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
you don't have to read the whole list

3335
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
Emerald Dragon came out on this

3336
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
Emerald Dragon which I

3337
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
which is kind of like one of the

3338
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
golden games to have for

3339
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
the PC Engine

3340
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
that came out on this

3341
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
we had Final Fight, Fantasy Zone

3342
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
all the stuff that I fucking love

3343
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
Galaga 98

3344
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
and several of the Garo Densetsu

3345
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
games which was Fatal Fury

3346
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
so

3347
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
hey

3348
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
this is the thing to have

3349
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
yeah so if you

3350
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
have one to give away Dark Sakura would like to talk to you

3351
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
honestly

3352
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
even if you could find one just for a good

3353
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
affordable price I'd be down for it

3354
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
I would give someone else's right

3355
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
arm for this

3356
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
alright anything else to say about this?

3357
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
no I know this system looks

3358
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
this is like Dark Sakura's like somebody made

3359
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
this just for you if you actually

3360
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
want to see really good comparisons

3361
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
for how well this ran everything

3362
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
in comparison to its

3363
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
uh

3364
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
what's the word, contemporaries

3365
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
look for

3366
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
oh shit Salamander which was Life Force

3367
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
but look for

3368
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
the channel that does Battle of

3369
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
the Ports and

3370
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
he's really good

3371
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
I mean a lot of them are played emulated but it

3372
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
really does showcase how

3373
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
great this system is compared

3374
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
to its contemporaries that were out at the time

3375
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
especially like the ZX Spectrum

3376
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
I mean that was just kind of sad

3377
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
but it's worth a shot I mean

3378
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
really really really if

3379
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
on my

3380
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
holy grail of systems to have

3381
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
this would be at the top of it followed by

3382
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
the Mardi or the FM Towns

3383
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
Mardi and then

3384
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
probably after that well I'd still really

3385
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
like a duo RX

3386
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
so

3387
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
there it is your classic system of the month

3388
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
the Sharp X68000

3389
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
good pick Dark Sakura

3390
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
I didn't really know a lot about that system

3391
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
but it looks really

3392
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
I mean just looking at the video it's looking

3393
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
like arcade versions it would be

3394
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
just it's on my list

3395
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
I would need you underwear for that system

3396
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
alright we're gonna take

3397
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
a break but when we come back we have plenty more show

3398
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
we're gonna get into rapid fire news your email

3399
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
and I promise a list list tonight so

3400
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
we're already two hours in so we're gonna

01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
we're gonna try to get

3402
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
through our break here and get back to part B

3403
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
so we can give you some more show here to hold you

3404
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000

alright so um

3441
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
PlayStation Plus they announced what games are

3442
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
coming out in November I am sorely

3443
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
disappointed because I actually own all these

3444
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
uh at least the VR

3445
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
games um but you get

3446
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
Worms battleground on PlayStation

3447
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000
4 I guess I don't have that bound

3448
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
which is an alright

3449
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
PlayStation VR PlayStation

3450
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
4 game uh the one though I do recommend

3451
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
and really there's no reason you shouldn't

3452
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
have this if you have a PlayStation VR

3453
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
but Until Dawn Rush of Blood

3454
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
is free and that's just seriously one of

3455
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
the best games on the on the platform

3456
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
um so definitely check that out

3457
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000

PlayStation 3 R-Type Dimensions

01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
on PlayStation 3 and Ragdoll

3461
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
Kung Fu Fists of Plastic on

3462
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
PS3 then they have um

3463
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
Fravita Dungeon Punks

3464
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
uh which is also cross platform with

3465
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
PlayStation 4 and Broken Sword 5

3466
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000

01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
those should be available shortly

3469
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
um and then of course

3470
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
another thing coming to the PlayStation

3471
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
VR um platform

3472
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
as well sorry I was giving

3473
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
Loki theme music there sorry

3474
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
um is Stranger Things

3475
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
the VR experience now

3476
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
I'm not sure what exactly this is

3477
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
um they kinda showed a little bit

3478
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
of a teaser but it

3479
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
sorta resembles the

3480
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
I don't know if it was a VR experience

3481
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
or like a 360

3482
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
video that I watched for Stranger Things

3483
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
um they had something that was kinda

3484
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
tied in with like the first season of

3485
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
of the show

3486
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
it was in like Will's house and stuff

3487
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
and it was alright

3488
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
if that's the same thing I hope it's

3489
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
more to that because I would like

3490
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
something a little bit more elaborate but

3491
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
I'm thinking it may just be that because

3492
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
that was available on the mobile VR

3493
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
platforms not too long ago

3494
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
but we'll see hopefully it's something

3495
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
more exciting

3496
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
alright well guess what the modders are

3497
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
up to recently they're still playing with

3498
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
Super Mario 64 this time it's not about that

3499
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
multiplayer thing that uh

3500
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
got the uh the other

3501
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
uh Mario thing shut down but this time it looks like

3502
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
somebody's put a portal gun

3503
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
into Super Mario 64

3504
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
this was by modder

3505
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
Kaze Emanuar

3506
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
who did a video called Portal

3507
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
Mario 64 which of course you can download

3508
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
right now before Nintendo shuts it down

3509
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000
and you can do the portal mechanic from Portal

3510
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
with Super Mario 64

3511
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
I mean need I say more about that

3512
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
sounds awesome

3513
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
yeah it does sound awesome

3514
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
why not both

3515
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
yes why not both

3516
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,000
I think we talked about this console

3517
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
not that long ago but it's the super

3518
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,000
retro bit micro console

3519
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
I think they had a regular version of this that was

3520
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
kind of amped but now they have a new one coming out

3521
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,000
and it was going to be Capcom and Data East

3522
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
titles like Strider, Final Fight, Joe

3523
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
and Mac well they

3524
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
also kind of teased it with and more

3525
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
to come right well now we figured out

3526
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
what the more is Technos

3527
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
is the next publisher

3528
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
from the classic days that it's

3529
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
going to be contributing to this which means

3530
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
Double Dragon will be coming

3531
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
to this as well as

3532
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
Combat Tribes and Renegade

3533
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
so there it is 60 bucks for the

3534
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,000
console which I guess is coming out later

3535
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
this year that's kind of neat Dark

3536
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
Sakura what do you have for us

3537
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
well I guess kind of sadness

3538
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
except he's doing it on

3539
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
why didn't it open

3540
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,000
sorry I just had a slight technical

3541
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
difficulty because it tried to open the

3542
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
RSS version yay

3543
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
anyway the

3544
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
producer of Danganronpa

3545
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
Saito Yuichiro is leaving

3546
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,000
Spike Chunsoft

3547
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,000
basically

3548
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,000
he said as of

3549
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,000
the end of October he's resigned

3550
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
and

3551
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
they did a Danganronpa

3552
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
surprise farewell party for him

3553
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
and he's going to be doing

3554
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
console games for

3555
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
a different world

3556
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
he said and he's also

3557
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
wearing

3558
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,000
in this

3559
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000
he's wearing Doraemon pajamas because

3560
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
he's also a big Doraemon fan which

3561
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,000
I think is funny because the

3562
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,000
original voice actor for

3563
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
Monokuma was also

3564
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
Doraemon back in the day so

3565
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000
pretty cool although

3566
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
he or she's not doing very well so very

3567
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,000
sad and then an easter egg

3568
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,000
an ass creed sorry

3569
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,000
assassin's creed

3570
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
because they like the ass

3571
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:09,000
is

3572
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,000
the TARDIS so basically if

3573
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
you're in Letopolis

3574
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
going through ancient

3575
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
Egypt under the

3576
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
water you will see a

3577
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
stone TARDIS it is very

3578
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,000
clearly the TARDIS as well

3579
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,000
so the

3580
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
doctor was here

3581
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,000
and that's it

3582
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,000
alright let's travel around

3583
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000

3594
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
but I'm afraid it might

3595
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:57,000

so DJ Max Respect gets its release in

3616
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
Japan on November 9th I wonder if we'll get that in the

3617
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000

3618
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000

3630
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,000
vein of Nobunaga's ambition

3631
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,000

02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000

02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000

3643
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
lastly on the 3DS

3644
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,000
this week some new Amiibo

3645
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000
makes its way out to Japan

3646
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,000
but I don't think we really have

3647
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,000
any major releases in Japan this week

3648
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,000
one minor one

3649
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,000
Cake Yasen Monogatari

3650
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
Oishi Sweet

3651
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,000
wo su koru comes out

3652
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,000
this week oh my god I want to play a cake

3653
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
game it's a cake game it's a cake baking

3654
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
game it's

3655
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,000
it's like Legend of Cake

3656
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
or something like that yeah

3657
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
maybe it's like Iron Chef

3658
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,000
but with cakes

3659
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
I want to be the ultimate patissier

3660
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
I want to be the ultimate cake eater

3661
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
anyway it's probably quiet this week because

3662
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
next week there's a little game coming out in Japan

3663
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
called oh it's actually two of them Pokemon

3664
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,000
Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon

3665
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:17,000
and I think there'll be a lot of people excited about

3666
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
that on the 3DS

3667
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:21,000
alright how about the UK Dark Sakura

3668
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:23,000
we have on the 7th

3669
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:25,000
Super Lucky's Tale

3670
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,000
on PC and the bone

3671
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,000
sorry the X bone and god

3672
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
dammit it's doing it again okay

3673
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
and then on the 10th Football Manager 2018

3674
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,000
and that's it

3675
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,000
it

3676
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
all over

3677
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,000
but we have to go to the mail bag

3678
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,000
we're not done hearing from Dark Sakura

3679
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
just yet

3680
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,000
every week you guys email us

3681
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
participate at orangelaungeradio.com

3682
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,000
and Dark Sakura dives in the mail bag

3683
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
head first and finds some emails

3684
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,000
worth our time reading on the show

3685
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:57,000
although with the weeks and weeks

3686
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
and weeks of no show

3687
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
I'm sure we've been flooded with emails

3688
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:03,000
one

3689
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,000
stinkin' email let's get to it

3690
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
hello LR

3691
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,000
hi YYR you're the only one who starts it that way

3692
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:11,000
after the

3693
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,000
continued discussion last week on

3694
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
free-to-play style monetizations

3695
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,000
and loot boxes being present in AAA games

3696
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:19,000
nowadays

3697
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:21,000
and about the potential reasons why I felt

3698
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,000
a need to chime in because something about

3699
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:25,000
this seems a bit familiar to me

3700
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,000
throughout my life I've spent a lot of time

3701
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
in arcades but I started talking to

3702
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
owners and operators when I was in college

3703
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
back then in 1999

3704
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,000
I remember the operator

3705
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:37,000
of an Aladdin's castle asking me

3706
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,000
what do you think the biggest earning

3707
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,000
game in this place is? Tekken Tag Tournament

3708
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,000
was hugely popular upon its

3709
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
release I was

3710
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,000
one of probably at least a dozen players

3711
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:49,000
who played it every weekend

3712
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,000
so that was my guess but that wasn't the

3713
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:53,000
answer I was shocked when

3714
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:55,000
this man said to me it's that coin pusher

3715
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,000
over there

3716
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
just a few years ago I owned a DJMax Technica

3717
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,000
cabinet and made a deal with the owner

3718
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,000
of an arcade in Queens to host it there

3719
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,000
and split the revenues I love

3720
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:07,000
the fact that he also had several other

3721
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,000
fantastic hardcore games such as

3722
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:11,000
DDRX2

3723
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:13,000
the latest

3724
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,000
Beatmania 2DX and Popin' Music

3725
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,000
plus an Initial D, Maximum Tune

3726
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:19,000
Tekken 6 and others being conveyed

3727
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,000
to me a sad truth the loyal crowd of

3728
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:23,000
hardcore players the ones that kept coming

3729
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:25,000
back to play these games over and over again

3730
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,000
were not nearly enough to keep his doors open

3731
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,000
the casual players that fed his ticket

3732
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,000
redemption and prized games were a far greater

3733
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,000
source of income

3734
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,000
backing up this theory even

3735
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,000
further is the story of

3736
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:39,000
Nanowet Arcade

3737
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:41,000
which opened in Fall 2014

3738
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:43,000
and was filled to the brim with over 50 arcade games

3739
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,000
spanning all eras and genre

3740
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
plus a number of pinball tables

3741
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,000
but absolutely no ticket redemption at all

3742
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
when I visited it felt like someone's dream

3743
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,000
arcade but with no redemption I wondered about its

3744
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:55,000
long term viability as it turned out

3745
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:57,000
it closed forever just a few days before its first

3746
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,000
birthday so what does this

3747
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
have to do with loot boxes and console games

3748
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:03,000
here it is think back

3749
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,000
to a generation or two every time

3750
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,000
a movie came out there were console

3751
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
and handheld games to match

3752
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000
you had games for kids

3753
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000
games based on Disney properties

3754
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,000
games for casuals games for families

3755
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,000
this is all because you had

3756
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,000
millions upon millions of casual

3757
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,000
console gamers where are they now

3758
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,000
the answer is simple poking away at

3759
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,000
phones and tablets

3760
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,000
according to a statistics site

3761
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
around 69 million of the most popular game

3762
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:31,000
consoles and handhelds were sold worldwide

3763
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,000
in 2011 by 2016

3764
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,000
this figure shrank to around 27 million

3765
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,000
that's a drop of more than 50%

3766
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:39,000
the same sites claim that within the

3767
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:41,000
US overall dollar sales of consoles

3768
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
and handheld video games dropped about

3769
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:45,000
50% between 2009 and 2015

3770
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:47,000
with spending on social media

3771
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:49,000
based and mobile games more than doubling

3772
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:51,000
over that same period

3773
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
over the last few years our hardware has progressed

3774
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:55,000
AAA games look better than ever

3775
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:57,000
budgets have fattened

3776
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,000
development team sizes have increased and even

3777
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,000
worse market competition has exploded

3778
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,000
and yet the casual audience who used to

3779
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:05,000
generate half the revenue has all but

3780
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:07,000
vanished from the arcade of the modern gaming market

3781
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:09,000
how can the hardcore

3782
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:11,000
keep the doors open

3783
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
since we don't have real

3784
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
redemption games we substitute the next best thing

3785
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,000
loot boxes quite honestly

3786
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,000
I think we're seeing the beginning of a huge

3787
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
market shake up one that we'll see the

3788
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,000
larger game developers and publishers needing to

3789
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:25,000
make massive changes just to keep their doors open

3790
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,000
except for Nintendo because they're Nintendo

3791
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
I guess we'll see keeping the

3792
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:31,000
discussion going

3793
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000
at home started getting better and better

3794
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
right when we were talking about the classic system of the week

3795
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,000
of the month this week we talked you were

3796
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
mentioning that the games looked as

3797
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:09,000
good as they did in the arcades and that was the early

3798
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:11,000
90s that was kind of the beginning of the

3799
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:13,000
end which is why we don't have things like Flynn's

3800
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,000
arcade anymore because

3801
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,000
you can get a lot of those similar experiences

3802
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:19,000
at home but that also kind

3803
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,000
of goes I think for the arcades to kind of do

3804
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,000
a soul searching a little bit you know what

3805
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,000
does seem to be doing well in arcades right now

3806
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:27,000
well shit it's kind of come full circle

3807
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,000
they're stealing a lot of the ideas from

3808
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,000
mobile these loyalty cards

3809
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:33,000
that unlock new characters or new cards

3810
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,000
or new songs in Bimani games

3811
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,000
through EMUs or you know the similar

3812
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,000
stuff in

3813
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:41,000
Square Enix's theater

3814
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:43,000
in those types of games you know that's

3815
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:45,000
I see a lot of that stuff kind of selling at

3816
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,000
round one so it is kind of interesting

3817
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,000
how a lot of that stuff does seem to be coming full circle

3818
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:51,000
in a way but round one is also

3819
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,000
I mean for all the fucking import games

3820
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:55,000
we talk about and how it feels great

3821
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,000
to be in an arcade that really feels like the arcades

3822
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,000
that we used to go to in our twenties like

3823
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,000
round one is also well

3824
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:03,000
over half redemption games

3825
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,000
there's so many

3826
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:07,000
freaking crane games well and on top of that

3827
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:09,000
too you know I think that

3828
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,000
the arcades that are

3829
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:15,000
really the ones that are thriving

3830
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:17,000
are the ones that have the right balance

3831
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:19,000
between the redemption like

3832
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,000
remember when we went to round one

3833
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:23,000
I think half the time was spent

3834
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,000
on the Bimani and the other half was

3835
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
spent on those claws not me

3836
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:29,000
that's you that was me well okay

3837
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:31,000
that was me you're the claw addict but

3838
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:33,000
you know I love those things and I got a

3839
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,000
really crappy looking no

3840
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,000
I got the blooper and I got a Yoshi

3841
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:39,000
you can spend your money on whatever the fuck you

3842
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:41,000
like but I think that it's also

3843
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:43,000
I think the concept that the

3844
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:45,000
average person who

3845
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:47,000
people like to get something

3846
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:49,000
that's another thought that I have about it

3847
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,000
people like to have

3848
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:53,000
either some kind of tangible

3849
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,000
or quantifiable result

3850
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:57,000
for the time that they've spent doing

3851
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:59,000
something it's not just the joy

3852
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:01,000
of playing anymore

3853
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:03,000
they want something for it people have this

3854
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:05,000
competitive nature and

3855
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:07,000
they want to see something for their efforts

3856
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,000
as Joe and her map points out

3857
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:11,000
bark aid seem to be doing well

3858
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:13,000
that's true all you have to clean up just

3859
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
add booze you know every city's

3860
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:17,000
got one of these at this point

3861
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,000
but that's that strikes to me

3862
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:21,000
more as like games aren't the

3863
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,000
feature at these places I'm sorry to say

3864
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,000
games are the niche

3865
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:27,000
for the bar some bars

3866
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:29,000
have music certain types of music

3867
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:31,000
some bars have really

3868
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:33,000
lush seating or food

3869
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:35,000
some bars have arcade machines

3870
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:37,000
those are the best ones yeah

3871
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:39,000
those are the ones we like but maybe

3872
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:41,000
there's some people that like to go to this other bar

3873
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:43,000
because they do sports

3874
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
uh every single

3875
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
Sacramento Kings game is on all the time at this

3876
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,000
bar you know maybe that's another

3877
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,000
niche who knows anyway

3878
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,000
so uh

3879
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,000
alright well thank you for the email yyr

3880
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:57,000
it is it is an interesting perspective I don't know

3881
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:59,000
if I would directly relate redemption

3882
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:01,000
games to loot boxes but I do

3883
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,000
see where you're going and I do kind of think

3884
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:05,000
the industry is a bit of a

3885
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:07,000
a circle in that regard so there is

3886
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
that it's like gambling I guess so

3887
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:11,000
it's similar to

3888
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,000
kind of the whole

3889
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,000
coin pusher games and stuff I mean

3890
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
because that's really what the loot boxes are you're

3891
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
gambling to see if you're going to get more

3892
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,000
out of that than you put into it

3893
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,000
and I guess even with the redemption stuff

3894
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:25,000
on top of that you're kind of earning tickets

3895
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:27,000
to purchase

3896
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:29,000
something that you want which of course all

3897
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:31,000
the things that they have in the redemption case

3898
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:33,000
are worth like nothing so

3899
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:35,000
unless of course it's Dave and Busters

3900
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:37,000
when I worked at an Aladdin's castle

3901
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:39,000
I would save all the little

3902
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:41,000
tickets that kids would leave in the machines

3903
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:43,000
and I would put them in I had this

3904
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:45,000
secret pouch in my purse and I

3905
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:47,000
turned them in before I left and

3906
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:49,000
got a polaroid camera

3907
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:51,000
and several Tekken 3

3908
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:53,000
shirts that were like

3909
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:55,000
only the ones they gave at the Namco arcades

3910
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:57,000
so you can get some good stuff

3911
02:12:57,000 --> 02:12:59,000
if you take your time

3912
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:01,000
alright you know

3913
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:03,000
you guys have been very well behaved

3914
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:05,000
and we feel bad for missing last week's

3915
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:07,000
show so you know what I think tonight

3916
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:09,000
we need to bring back a segment that we haven't

3917
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:11,000
done in a very long time and that

3918
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,000
segment is listless

3919
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:15,000
but I do have one small change

3920
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:17,000
you see the old theme song we used

3921
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:19,000
to use for listless that now gets

3922
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:21,000
our episodes flagged on YouTube for copyright

3923
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:23,000
infringement so I'm going to have to change the

3924
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:25,000
song that we use so I'm very sorry to Crystal Waters

3925
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:27,000
but blame your music label

3926
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,000
people for content IDing at the drop

3927
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,000
of a hat so I accidentally let

3928
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:33,000
this sneak out a little bit earlier but I thought a new

3929
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,000
theme we could use for listless is

3930
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:39,000
listless, listless, listless, listless, listless

3931
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:41,000
should this one get us flagged either?

3932
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:43,000
what?

3933
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:45,000
should this one get us flagged either?

3934
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:47,000
eh it might but it would be worth it

3935
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:49,000
ok

3936
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:51,000
so here we go

3937
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:53,000
tonight's list I'm sure you're all dying

3938
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:55,000
to know the topic since we haven't done this in forever

3939
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:57,000
well since we had that news

3940
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:59,000
story about Just Dance

3941
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:01,000
becoming a live experience

3942
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:03,000
to which Loki at quite

3943
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:05,000
some length discussed here on the show

3944
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:07,000
we thought well then if that's the case

3945
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,000
which video game

3946
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,000
should become a live

3947
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:13,000
experience so tonight

3948
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:15,000
we will be building the definitive list

3949
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:17,000
here which video game

3950
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:19,000
needs a live

3951
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:21,000
experience alright so

3952
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:23,000
you can participate with us over at

3953
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:25,000
live.vognetwork.com and

3954
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:27,000
god I haven't done this segment in forever so I hope

3955
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:29,000
the list works right

3956
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:31,000
but you should see the question pop

3957
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:33,000
up there on the page as well

3958
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:35,000
as our four contestants tonight so we

3959
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:37,000
haven't done listless in a while so this is how it works

3960
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:39,000
ok by the way it's not list

3961
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:41,000
list it's listless

3962
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:43,000
Elliot it's a little play on words but anyway

3963
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:45,000
so with listless

3964
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,000
what's gonna happen is that we're gonna

3965
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,000
put together the definitive list it's a very

3966
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:51,000
scientific process there's no argument

3967
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:53,000
so each host and a special guest

3968
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:55,000
will bring a list of three to

3969
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:57,000
the table and then one by one we're

3970
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:59,000
gonna go around and determine which item

3971
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:01,000
is not worthy of the list

3972
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,000
so we'll take a list of twelve items and bring it down to a list

3973
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:05,000
of eight items at which point you

3974
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:07,000
guys will vote in our chat you're gonna click on

3975
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:09,000
your number one and your two answers in that order

3976
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:11,000
submit them in over at live.vognetwork.com

3977
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:13,000
and we will build the definitive list

3978
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:15,000
to which there is no arguing

3979
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:17,000
it's done and of course

3980
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:19,000
you know we should talk about you know the whole

3981
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:21,000
elimination part of that as well

3982
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:23,000
oh yeah the whole twist where

3983
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:25,000
we made it so that if a host has

3984
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:27,000
two answers eliminated from their list

3985
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:29,000
the third gets immunity and cannot be eliminated

3986
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:31,000
cause unfortunately we had some issues

3987
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:33,000
in the past where somebody's

3988
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:35,000
list just totally got eliminated

3989
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:37,000
and that was sad so

3990
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:39,000
anyway joining us tonight a very

3991
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:41,000
special guest who you hear sometimes on the show

3992
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:43,000
Alan is joining us tonight

3993
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:45,000
hi Alan hello how are you doing

3994
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:47,000

4025
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
the list Alan we're gonna

4026
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
let our guests go first tonight what is your number

4027
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
three answer for which video game needs

4028
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000

4029
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000

4030
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:03,000
shower with your dad

4031
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:05,000
simulator I

4032
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:07,000
believe it's the name of the game

4033
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:09,000
and why did you pick this

4034
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:11,000
because it's fucking funny

4035
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:13,000
alright

4036
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:15,000
there it is it has been added to the list

4037
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:17,000
Dark Sakura

4038
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:19,000
what is gonna be your number three pick

4039
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:21,000
I was thinking in terms of games

4040
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,000
so I think Farmville

4041
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:25,000
Farmville real life where you get just

4042
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:27,000
like regular casual people who've

4043
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:29,000
never been to a farm and they have to

4044
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:31,000
fucking farm

4045
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
so Farmville is your answer

4046
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
essentially is the game that needs to be

4047
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
Farmville IRL ok Farmville IRL

4048
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
and you said Farmville

4049
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
well it's almost in a way

4050
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
it sounds like kind of like a sick dystopian

4051
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
future where like there are no more

4052
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
it's like being Zsa Zsa Gabor

4053
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:51,000
in Green Acres I was trying

4054
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:53,000
to go with like that futuristic like

4055
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:55,000
sad approach no I'm thinking Zsa Zsa Gabor

4056
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:57,000
who has no concept of what to do on a fucking farm

4057
02:17:57,000 --> 02:17:59,000
ok what

4058
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:01,000
was it Zsa Zsa or Ava it was Ava

4059
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:03,000
ok one of them

4060
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:05,000
it was a Gabor

4061
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:07,000
alright my number

4062
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:09,000
three answer what item am I

4063
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:11,000
gonna pick for my number three answer

4064
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:13,000
I decided that the experience that needed

4065
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:15,000
a live event was civilization

4066
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:17,000
yes

4067
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:19,000
civilization would be a live event and you

4068
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:21,000
can actually rule the world

4069
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:23,000
and uh

4070
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:25,000
and nuke Gandhi right back

4071
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:27,000
there you go civilization it's on the list

4072
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:29,000
Loki your number three answer

4073
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:31,000
for what video game needs a live experience

4074
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:33,000
um I see

4075
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:35,000
like the problem I have with like the Just Dance

4076
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:37,000
one was there's really no point to it because

4077
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,000
you're basically going to watch

4078
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:41,000
people dressed up like artists

4079
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:43,000
that's you know perform

4080
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:45,000
songs but they aren't the artists that perform

4081
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:47,000
the songs and they're not really performing the songs

4082
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:49,000
dancing so an actual

4083
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:51,000
game that would be like performing music

4084
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:53,000
that I thought was pretty awesome is DJ Heroes

4085
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:55,000
so I would totally see a live

4086
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:57,000
performance of DJ Heroes

4087
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:59,000
stuff with actual DJs

4088
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:01,000
mashing songs together

4089
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:03,000
so basically Activision's

4090
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:05,000
E3 press conference from that year

4091
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:07,000
like touring the country

4092
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:09,000
kinda

4093
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:11,000
but you have like Daft Punk

4094
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:13,000
and you know Dead

4095
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:15,000
Mouse and stuff like that I mean it'd be pretty awesome

4096
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:17,000
no I get it that would be awesome that would be awesome

4097
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:19,000
alright some answers well I'll get to

4098
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:21,000
the answers before the last answer we'll get to

4099
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:23,000
our answers from chat but uh let's see

4100
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:25,000
maybe some of us will steal them and put them on the list

4101
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:27,000
for now the number two answer

4102
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:29,000
from Allen

4103
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:31,000
Hotline Miami

4104
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:33,000
Hotline Miami

4105
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:35,000
and why are you picking Hotline Miami

4106
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:37,000
cause that is the dystopian

4107
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:39,000
future listen to this awesome music

4108
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:41,000
you're gonna fucking die

4109
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:43,000
oh shotgun to the face you're dead

4110
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:45,000
are you actually killing people

4111
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:47,000
at the Hotline Miami live experience

4112
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:49,000
no it would be like the um

4113
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:51,000
one of those the Universal

4114
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:53,000
Studios things that's like super

4115
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:55,000
realistic where it's

4116
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:57,000
like don't pay $50

4117
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:59,000
to have us jump at you and then punch us in the fucking face

4118
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:01,000
or don't go in if you have a heart condition one of those

4119
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:03,000
okay like the scare

4120
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:05,000
events or some Fright Night

4121
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:07,000
something like that alright

4122
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:09,000
Hotline Miami you're at

4123
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:11,000
did I marry you for real your answers are kinda

4124
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:13,000
disturbing

4125
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:15,000
the number two answer

4126
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:17,000
is Hotline Miami

4127
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:19,000
Dark Soccer your number two answer

4128
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:21,000
I was going to say

4129
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:23,000
actually something along the lines of

4130
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:25,000
Call of Duty where it's

4131
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:27,000
basically either like a laser tag or paintball

4132
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:29,000
but they set up like

4133
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:31,000
recreations of like maps

4134
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:33,000
and then you pay to get in and play the maps

4135
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:35,000
they actually have that but you know do they really

4136
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:37,000
they do they did it for uh one of

4137
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:39,000
the Call of Duty's yeah they actually set up a map

4138
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:41,000
and they did it was Airsoft

4139
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:43,000
but does it tour

4140
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:45,000
no there you go

4141
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:47,000
so

4142
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:49,000
what am I calling this Call of Duty

4143
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:51,000
IRL

4144
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:53,000
just like your Farm Bill

4145
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:55,000
which I need to add Farm Bill IRL

4146
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:57,000
Call of Duty in real life

4147
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:59,000
I would hope most of this would be IRL

4148
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:01,000
alright Dark Tetsuya says

4149
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:03,000
that would be kinda cool so you have at least

4150
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:05,000
one paying customer there you go

4151
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:07,000
alright my number two answer is

4152
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:09,000
just make Blizzard World

4153
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:11,000
real just

4154
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:13,000
everybody lost their shit

4155
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:15,000
at that press conference

4156
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:17,000
when Blizzard showed that as

4157
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,000
the new Overwatch map so my answer is

4158
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:21,000
just make Blizzard World real just

4159
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:23,000
if you build it they will come just do it

4160
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:25,000
but not in China do it

4161
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:27,000
here no offense to China but

4162
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:29,000
we need one

4163
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:31,000
here for the US income

4164
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:33,000
and all that good stuff or at least our

4165
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:35,000
friends in Canada alright just build

4166
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:37,000
Blizzard World IRL

4167
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:39,000
Loki your turn your number

4168
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:41,000
two answer

4169
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,000
Splatoon

4170
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:45,000
oh that's a good answer why did you

4171
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:47,000
say Splatoon because it's just like paintball

4172
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:49,000
except you're shooting on the walls and everything

4173
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:51,000
and it would be really messy and I

4174
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:53,000
at least see people playing that people like

4175
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:55,000
doing was it like the Tough Mudder stuff

4176
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:57,000
where they covered in mud so what about paint

4177
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:59,000

02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:37,000
video game that they need to make

4197
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:39,000

the number three

4203
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:51,000
they would have a Half-Life

4204
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:53,000
episode 3 area

4205
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:55,000
and they would have a Half-Life 3 area and they would have a

4206
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:57,000
Left 4 Dead 3 area and this would be the only place

4207
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:59,000
you could actually ever play these games

4208
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:01,000
yeah and they would have three

4209
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:03,000
Gabe Newell's you give them

4210
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:05,000

big belly laughs

4213
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:13,000
alright Valve presents

4214
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:17,000
the number three not live

4215
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:21,000

4216
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:23,000

4217
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:25,000
number one answer

4218

Sims The Tour

4219
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:29,000
where basically

4220
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:31,000
you have to be in

4221
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:33,000
a Sims environment and

4222
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:35,000
can't do anything until someone

4223
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:37,000
controlling you tells you you can't

4224
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:39,000
I'm gonna get out of this pool

4225
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:41,000
I'm gonna drown in here

4226
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:43,000
I really need to use the bathroom

4227
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:45,000
if they don't let you pee then you have to pee your pants

4228
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:47,000
that's not fun and wear really horrible clothing

4229
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:49,000
and you can only speak Simlish

4230
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:51,000
me me me wah bweeb wah boo boo

4231
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:53,000
and

4232
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:55,000
Katy Perry's there doing a concert in

4233
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:57,000
Simlish because she had that

4234
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:59,000
song that was in Simlish which was ridiculous

4235
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:01,000
but it was funny

4236
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:03,000
we're almost there to the end of the list

4237
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:05,000
here JD in chat says

4238
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:07,000
so the power exchange I don't know if that's

4239
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:09,000
that or one of the chat answers but anyway

4240
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:11,000
my number one answer

4241
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:13,000
on top of the list I'm gonna go

4242
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:15,000
you know here at OLR

4243
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:17,000
we have to respect the classics

4244
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:19,000
right so I'm gonna go with one of the

4245
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:21,000
all time classics here at Orange

4246
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:23,000
Lounge Radio in fact I would

4247
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:25,000
I would bet many of you don't even fucking

4248
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:27,000
know this game if it wasn't for Orange

4249
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,000
Lounge Radio but at one time

4250
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:31,000
it was so noteworthy it was our classic game

4251
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:33,000
of the week and I think it's time to bring back

4252
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:35,000
the 21 anniversary

4253
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:37,000

4254
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:39,000

Lord

4256
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:43,000
everybody move your body

4257
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:45,000
isn't like Miss Nude World

4258
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:47,000
like an actual event though I mean

4259
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:49,000
but does it tour

4260
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:51,000
I

4261
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:53,000
maybe I don't know

4262
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:55,000
will it be in your city

4263
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:57,000

4264
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:59,000

Someone Gets to be the Kangaroo

4282
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:35,000

4283
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:37,000
Rage

4284
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:39,000
Sjoan Hunter Matt

4285
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:41,000
No that's not fucking cool

4286
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:43,000
That's why I said Seek Therapy. Smack

4287
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:45,000
You hit enter without thinking

4288
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:47,000
Rage Nator says

4289
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:49,000
My number one is Genital Jousting

4290
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:55,000
And Dark Tetsuya said

4291
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:57,000
was it Rabbids or Rayman?

4292
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:59,000
I think it was on the list so there you go

4293
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:01,000
Alright

4294
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:03,000
Those are what the chatters said

4295
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:05,000
Loki, what did you say?

4296
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:07,000
You know I was gonna go with

4297
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:09,000
Dead or Alive

4298
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:11,000
Extreme Beach Volleyball but

4299
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:13,000
being that we have Mr. New World on there

4300
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:15,000
I probably won't do that so

4301
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:17,000
Nah I'm still gonna go with

4302
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:19,000
Dead or Alive Extreme Beach Volleyball

4303
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:23,000
Cause

4304
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:25,000
of all the obvious reasons

4305
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:27,000
Say No More

4306
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:29,000
Say No More, that's just the Olympics

4307
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:31,000
Alright

4308
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:33,000
It's like the Olympics

4309
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:35,000
Like the

4310
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:37,000
XFL of the Olympics

4311
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:39,000
Here is the list as it stands

4312
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:41,000
Shower with your dad

4313
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:43,000
Simulator, Hotline Miami

4314
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:45,000
Valve presents the number three live

4315
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:47,000
Farmville IRL, Call of Duty IRL

4316
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:49,000
Sims The Tour, Civilization

4317
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:51,000
Just Make Blizzard World Real

4318
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:53,000
Miss Nude World 96, DJ Hero

4319
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:55,000
Splatoon, DOA

4320
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:57,000
Extreme Beach Volleyball

4321
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:59,000
Now it's tough but it's

4322
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:01,000
part of the process

4323
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:03,000
Alan, you gotta go first. Which of these

4324
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:05,000
is not worthy of the list?

4325
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:09,000
I don't wanna be mean

4326
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:11,000
and get rid of anyone's

4327
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:13,000
I feel that

4328
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,000
God dammit

4329
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:19,000
Can I do one of my own?

4330
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:23,000
I don't know if we've ever had that happen before

4331
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:25,000
Can a host take one of their own off the list?

4332
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:27,000
Alright, why not? Sure

4333
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:29,000
Yes, a host can take their own item off the list

4334
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:31,000
Half Life or the Valve 3 thing

4335
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:33,000
Dammit, that's what I was gonna pick

4336
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:35,000
Alright, why are we eliminating

4337
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:37,000
Valve the number three?

4338
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:39,000
Cause it's not a game, it was just me making fun of Valve

4339
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:41,000
I was gonna say cause you could go there

4340
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:43,000
and there'd be nothing there cause they

4341
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:45,000
don't produce the number three of anything

4342
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:47,000
Alright, so in an OLR

4343
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:49,000
first, Alan has taken

4344
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:51,000
his own item off the list

4345
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:53,000
Valve presents the number three

4346
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:55,000
is stricken from the list

4347
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:57,000
Dark Sakura

4348
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:59,000
Which of these is not worthy of the list?

4349
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:01,000
Sorry Alan, I'm taking off shower with your dad

4350
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:03,000
Ah, shower with your dad

4351
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:05,000
simulator. Poor

4352
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:07,000
Alan. First, well of course he did it to

4353
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:09,000
himself, so there it is

4354
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:11,000
That's right, Hotline Miami

4355
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:13,000
The Hotline Miami was pretty rad

4356
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:15,000
Now has immunity, but shower with your dad

4357
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:17,000
has been stricken from the list

4358
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:19,000
Ooh, my turn, what am I gonna eliminate from the list?

4359
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:21,000
Um

4360
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:23,000
These are, like

4361
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:25,000
yeah, this is a pretty good roundup of answers

4362
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:27,000
Um

4363
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:29,000
I'm gonna, I'm gonna

4364
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:31,000
Sorry Jamie, I'm gonna take one of yours

4365
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:33,000
I'm doing Farm Bill

4366
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:35,000
Just because, like, I think you and I

4367
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:37,000
have a different vision of what that would be

4368
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:39,000
and I wasn't jealous

4369
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:41,000
I just think it would be hilarious

4370
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:43,000
to have, like, regular people have to actually do a farm

4371
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:45,000
Eh, fair enough

4372
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:47,000
But unfortunately, I've already clicked the button

4373
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:49,000
It's gone, so, sorry Jamie

4374
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:51,000
Alright, Loki, last but not least

4375
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:53,000
the last one, which of these is not worthy

4376
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:55,000
of the list?

4377
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:57,000
Um, I'm just gonna have to take Miss Nude World

4378
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:59,000
96 off there

4379
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:01,000
Oh, you bastard! Oh, why would you

4380
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:03,000
eliminate Miss Nude World?

4381
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:05,000
I mean, it's old, it's just

4382
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:07,000
Oh, I see, you're afraid

4383
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:09,000
that now it's about

4384
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:11,000
Although, I think that folks

4385
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:13,000
in their 50s can be just as fabulous

4386
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:15,000
that maybe, maybe

4387
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:17,000
we, you know, these folks that were in their

4388
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:19,000
prime at one point, or maybe

4389
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:21,000
maybe they shouldn't be touring

4390
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:23,000
It's just, it's gonna be weird with demons

4391
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:25,000
and, like, and just, like

4392
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:27,000
old Bikini models

4393
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:29,000
and porn stars, I just

4394
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:31,000
it's just, it's gonna be, like, weird

4395
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:33,000
Oh, the mic, sorry

4396
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:35,000
Yeah, I mean, superficially

4397
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:37,000
it's naked ladies, but if you've actually

4398
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:39,000
played Miss Nude World, if any

4399
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:41,000
college kids tried to go to that high

4400
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:43,000
Mm-mm, no, like what

4401
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:45,000
Loki is saying, that's a bad time

4402
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:47,000
Alright, well

4403
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:49,000
rules are rules, so that is it

4404
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:51,000
It has been removed from

4405
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:53,000

There it is, which video game needs a live experience?

4422
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:27,000
I'm really confident

4423
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:29,000
of one, possibly both

4424
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:31,000
that are gonna win, and I could've been a dick

4425
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:33,000
and I was like, that's a really good thing, so I'm gonna be a dick

4426
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:35,000
and get rid of it, and I didn't, and I took

4427
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:37,000
one in the knee for myself

4428
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:39,000
You took an arrow to the knee, as appropriate for him

4429
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:41,000
It's too bad, cause I would've voted for the same one

4430
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:43,000
that you took away, so you could've

4431
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:45,000
Alright, well

4432
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:47,000

4443
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:44,660
this

4444
02:31:44,660 --> 02:31:46,320
this

4445
02:31:46,320 --> 02:31:47,860
this

4446
02:31:47,860 --> 02:31:49,760
this

4447
02:31:49,760 --> 02:31:50,740
this

4448
02:31:50,740 --> 02:31:56,780
this

4449
02:31:56,780 --> 02:31:59,780
this

4450
02:31:59,780 --> 02:32:01,180
this

4451
02:32:01,180 --> 02:32:02,740
this

4452
02:32:02,740 --> 02:32:04,120
this

4453
02:32:04,120 --> 02:32:04,540
satisfied

4454
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:12,040
dual they have stereo speakers in the front and for her mod lithium ion

4455
02:32:12,040 --> 02:32:19,560
battery so it looks alright I mean considering what phones go for nowadays

4456
02:32:19,560 --> 02:32:24,520
you know that price range is actually not so bad so that's on on Verizon

4457
02:32:24,520 --> 02:32:30,120
because that's what I have but who says I'm gonna stick with Verizon so there's

4458
02:32:30,120 --> 02:32:36,640
a gaming phone and 120 FPS you know what that would be really good for and I

4459
02:32:36,640 --> 02:32:43,080
don't know if it supports it though VR VR content but is there any is this phone

4460
02:32:43,080 --> 02:32:47,760
compatible with any of the VR platforms that are on Android I would be very

4461
02:32:47,760 --> 02:32:52,520
interested to find out because if it is and hell yes I'm on board

4462
02:32:52,520 --> 02:32:56,560
Brad from pop culture says the razor phone looks kind of cool

4463
02:32:56,560 --> 02:33:01,920
corky says 120 Hertz isn't a new thing in portable devices the iPad Pro has one

4464
02:33:01,920 --> 02:33:06,480
so but you know those iPad pros are probably a little more expensive than

4465
02:33:06,480 --> 02:33:12,480
this device so yeah 700 for a phone mean look at the Samsung Galaxy s8 and the

4466
02:33:12,480 --> 02:33:19,160
node 8 and I mean that 700 is not that ridiculous as far as phone prices go

4467
02:33:19,160 --> 02:33:23,520
yeah it's actually kind of a little bit on the lower end all right

4468
02:33:23,520 --> 02:33:27,240
raising your wants to know will the phone play Miss nude world 96 yes

4469
02:33:27,240 --> 02:33:36,120
probably would I think of a 486 PC can play this new world 96 to be fair all

4470
02:33:36,120 --> 02:33:42,240
right let's talk about Niantic the company behind Pokemon go and ingress

4471
02:33:42,240 --> 02:33:46,000
which you know we don't know what else they're working on but we do know they

4472
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:51,280
have acquired a company named Evertune that's right Evertune was acquired by

4473
02:33:51,280 --> 02:33:56,040
Niantic this week and John Hanke the CEO of Niantic announced this Evertune

4474
02:33:56,040 --> 02:33:59,720
is a recently established mobile animation app and they're doing this to

4475
02:33:59,720 --> 02:34:05,540
expand the social media functionality of the games Evertune was founded in 2016

4476
02:34:05,540 --> 02:34:10,480
and the startup raised 1.7 million today from a variety of publishers for their

4477
02:34:10,480 --> 02:34:15,700
film sharing app for social networks like YouTube or Twitter so one could

4478
02:34:15,700 --> 02:34:19,480
imagine that maybe there will be something where Pokemon are animated or

4479
02:34:19,480 --> 02:34:22,520
something in a later version of Pokemon go but really this could be anything

4480
02:34:22,520 --> 02:34:27,460
Pokemon animated emojis it could be something for a future game Niantic is

4481
02:34:27,460 --> 02:34:32,000
planning that we just don't know yet ingress animated emojis who knows who

4482
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:34,960
knows you know speaking of this whole like Pokemon go and all this stuff I

4483
02:34:34,960 --> 02:34:38,000
didn't get into this during my gaming week but did you know there's a knock

4484
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:43,600
off game in the App Store and usually usually knock off no game all right

4485
02:34:43,600 --> 02:34:47,480
tell me there's Garfield game on there at some point too but here's the thing

4486
02:34:47,480 --> 02:34:52,880
so the latest knockoff game is called Draconius go which is like dragons and

4487
02:34:52,880 --> 02:34:59,480
stuff and they don't have the same like logical layout of gyms and stuff like

4488
02:34:59,480 --> 02:35:04,160
Pokemon go has when you first look at the game you'd be like this game is a

4489
02:35:04,160 --> 02:35:09,920
complete flippin ripoff of Pokemon go and like because it looks like imagine

4490
02:35:09,920 --> 02:35:13,600
what Pokemon go looked like in February before they announced gen 2 before they

4491
02:35:13,600 --> 02:35:18,400
did the gyms this is what Draconius go kind of looks like at first glance like

4492
02:35:18,400 --> 02:35:21,700
it's all the same stuff to look there's a little dragon thingy I don't think I

4493
02:35:21,700 --> 02:35:25,520
have this one yet on the house so I'm gonna capture that yes Alan with the

4494
02:35:25,520 --> 02:35:28,720
exception of the critters it really looks like they downloaded the AP get

4495
02:35:28,720 --> 02:35:34,320
AP gay ha APK and like just unzipped it with like a dash tar well it's all

4496
02:35:34,320 --> 02:35:38,120
unity so they could just reverse engineer so when we say it's a knock

4497
02:35:38,120 --> 02:35:43,280
off it it really has a lot of the actual original layout gooey and everything is

4498
02:35:43,280 --> 02:35:48,000
all but here's the reason why I bring it up so yes at first glance when you

4499
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:50,920
play it for the first five minutes right this is a complete fucking ripoff of

4500
02:35:50,920 --> 02:35:56,640
Pokemon go but then you start to see they added more there's PvP in it

4501
02:35:56,640 --> 02:36:01,160
there's different types of ways to retrain your monsters in it there's like

4502
02:36:01,160 --> 02:36:04,960
these other features the Pokemon go doesn't have and you know what Niantic

4503
02:36:04,960 --> 02:36:08,360
is pissed and I think they're going after this developer for infringement

4504
02:36:08,360 --> 02:36:12,360
basically but it also kind of goes to show like hey these guys have added

4505
02:36:12,360 --> 02:36:15,320
these features to the game that you guys have been kind of sitting on for

4506
02:36:15,320 --> 02:36:17,920
months so it's just interesting I'm not saying if it's right or wrong or

4507
02:36:17,920 --> 02:36:20,700
anything but it's just an interesting development well they don't own the

4508
02:36:20,700 --> 02:36:26,080
copyright to that type of gameplay granted it looks very similar but change

4509
02:36:26,080 --> 02:36:29,940
up that that's fine a lawsuit that you come up with that just change the way

4510
02:36:29,940 --> 02:36:36,520
your game looks enough and you know put it as your own thing I mean I don't know

4511
02:36:36,520 --> 02:36:39,480
there's a lot of games to come out that are that people think are knockoffs

4512
02:36:39,480 --> 02:36:42,920
everything like remember everything is they oh it's a street fire clone or oh

4513
02:36:42,920 --> 02:36:45,960
that's you know just a clone of this game that's a minecraft clone and then

4514
02:36:45,960 --> 02:36:51,800
it all becomes its own thing now I want to catch this creature because I don't

4515
02:36:51,800 --> 02:36:55,000
have one yet there's the one of the creatures is called a potty and that

4516
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:59,320
made me laugh because it's an actual little fire pot oh I was thinking it was

4517
02:36:59,320 --> 02:37:02,320
a potty and I know but that's well I laughed because the name it does make

4518
02:37:02,320 --> 02:37:05,200
you think of that anyway there you go so I don't want to give this game too much

4519
02:37:05,200 --> 02:37:08,680
credit but I thought it was interesting that they've kind of taken the template

4520
02:37:08,680 --> 02:37:12,920
for Pokemon go and added a ton of shit to it and I'm sure Niantic ain't happy

4521
02:37:12,920 --> 02:37:16,800
about it so there you go who fucking who add some fucking features to it and maybe

4522

4523
02:37:21,280 --> 02:37:25,720

4524
02:37:25,720 --> 02:37:29,680
I'm still super excited about Dragon Ball fighter Z even though the story

4525
02:37:29,680 --> 02:37:33,960
mode is gonna be fucking bizarre basically you're playing quantum leap

4526
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:39,520
you are showing up in the bodies of these different Dragon Ball characters

4527
02:37:39,520 --> 02:37:46,680
let's try to go through the story and you've got this other artificial human

4528
02:37:46,680 --> 02:37:53,080
who is talking about eating you like like legit food like she says that

4529
02:37:53,080 --> 02:37:57,800
everyone's tasty but like at the the start of the trailer it's like you wake

4530
02:37:57,800 --> 02:38:03,000
up and you're in Goku's body and it's really bizarre so I don't know it's

4531
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:07,320
gonna be fun the trailer looks really neat though it's such a pretty game I'm

4532
02:38:07,320 --> 02:38:14,400
so excited and honestly enough it it is rendered in game but it looks like real

4533
02:38:14,400 --> 02:38:19,760
animation and that's what I'm super impressed by so super excited it needs to

4534
02:38:19,760 --> 02:38:24,440
oh and it's gonna be of course out I think January 2018 yeah yeah I was

4535
02:38:24,440 --> 02:38:28,000
about to say how long is the wait for this game because sorry January 26th

4536
02:38:28,200 --> 02:38:35,800
okay that's not too bad yeah it's not bad excitement don't kill spiders die

4537
02:38:35,800 --> 02:38:39,080
have to it was trying to it was looking at me catch it and take it outside

4538
02:38:39,080 --> 02:38:44,080
sizing me up to eat me up just take it I got one out of my bed and took it

4539
02:38:44,080 --> 02:38:50,840
outside it was a cute little wolf spider Rob gross they eat mosquitoes yeah

4540
02:38:50,840 --> 02:38:55,800
anyway let's go to a couple more stories for you guys we're gonna open up the

4541
02:38:55,800 --> 02:38:58,680
skype line briefly we're running a little long time so we can't take too

4542
02:38:58,680 --> 02:39:04,000
many calls we'll open up the skype line briefly but first Loki all right so this

4543
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:07,720
is a game that I've you know been interested to see a localization forward

4544
02:39:07,720 --> 02:39:14,680
they've never done it so captain rainbow has a fan translation for the game

4545
02:39:14,680 --> 02:39:20,080
because it was originally only released in Japan and that's kind of where it

4546
02:39:20,080 --> 02:39:24,240
ended there but you can actually check it out now so they have it's a patch

4547
02:39:24,240 --> 02:39:31,320
made by a guy goes by mark ass that's right and he basically combines the

4548
02:39:31,320 --> 02:39:37,920
works of his translation group kirameki along with his stuff as well so now

4549
02:39:37,920 --> 02:39:43,180
it's almost 100% complete but there's still a few things missing but it should

4550
02:39:43,180 --> 02:39:46,760
be enough to at least play the game nice that's kind of cool enough to get you

4551
02:39:46,760 --> 02:39:51,240
through all right this is the last chance to submit listless votes it will

4552
02:39:51,240 --> 02:39:54,440
be closing shortly so if you have not submitted your listless votes tonight

4553
02:39:54,440 --> 02:39:57,920
make sure you get to live dot vog network comm and get those votes in last

4554
02:39:57,920 --> 02:40:02,960
call meanwhile one more story for you guys tonight and that is that something's

4555
02:40:02,960 --> 02:40:06,880
going on with Konami because they're acting kind of shitty to their composer

4556
02:40:06,880 --> 02:40:11,800
teams that create the music in Bamani games obviously things like beat mania

4557
02:40:11,800 --> 02:40:16,480
DDR and even the newer stuff like music and you know sound voltix and stuff

4558
02:40:16,480 --> 02:40:20,460
would be nothing if it wasn't for the actual music in the games but what's

4559
02:40:20,460 --> 02:40:24,580
interesting about it is that now these songs in the game are being attributed

4560
02:40:24,580 --> 02:40:30,220
to Bamani sound team that's right so we don't see you know the actual creator of

4561
02:40:30,220 --> 02:40:35,940
the songs anymore it's just attributed to Bamani sound team so yeah some folks

4562
02:40:35,940 --> 02:40:40,140
are theorizing that this could go back to a dispute about how there's a record

4563
02:40:40,140 --> 02:40:43,820
label called beat nation records that came out about a decade ago and this has

4564
02:40:43,820 --> 02:40:49,380
led to live concerts and soundtrack CDs and so on and Konami may actually be a

4565
02:40:49,380 --> 02:40:54,180
little bit afraid of this so they want to control their artists very well hmm I

4566
02:40:54,180 --> 02:40:57,620
don't know it sounds like a very BuzzFeed thing to do well and it's it's

4567
02:40:57,620 --> 02:41:02,260
just kind of just add that to the list of grievances we have with Konami and

4568
02:41:02,260 --> 02:41:07,220
ask Atari how well that went back in the 2600 days with not crediting your

4569
02:41:07,220 --> 02:41:11,980
creators and what happened is the cause of that the answer is we got Activision

4570
02:41:11,980 --> 02:41:18,460
which made better games for Atari's own platform mm-hmm so anyway uh there you

4571
02:41:18,460 --> 02:41:22,660
go I don't know if you guys have anything to say about that but just I'm

4572
02:41:22,660 --> 02:41:27,580
not surprised considering the source yeah add add this to the list of Konami

4573
02:41:27,580 --> 02:41:33,340
grievances shall we all right before we get those bastards before we get to the

4574
02:41:33,340 --> 02:41:37,100
skype line which we are about ready to open up dark soccer has requested that

4575
02:41:37,100 --> 02:41:39,640
we bring back another segment we haven't done in a while and it's something we

4576
02:41:39,640 --> 02:41:44,100
can do on demand but it's CF use of the week

4577
02:41:48,460 --> 02:41:50,460
you

4578
02:41:57,780 --> 02:42:05,500
my SU goes to people who don't respect the word stop especially when the person

4579
02:42:05,500 --> 02:42:13,220
who is requesting that you stop happens to be autistic usually we're gonna tell

4580
02:42:13,220 --> 02:42:17,740
you to stop something if it's necessary or else if we don't see anything it's

4581
02:42:17,740 --> 02:42:23,380
going to be very ugly so when someone says I don't want to do this anymore

4582
02:42:23,380 --> 02:42:31,340
fucking respect them I'm in a pass because I'll sub tweet something and put

4583
02:42:31,340 --> 02:42:34,500
my foot in my mouth so low do you want to say anything yeah we say that if you

4584
02:42:34,500 --> 02:42:37,100
do the people that are driving in front of me on the way this show today they

4585

4588
02:42:55,820 --> 02:43:03,180

4589
02:43:03,180 --> 02:43:08,540

4644
02:47:45,260 --> 02:47:50,340
you're on orange on its radio who's this what was my bad I muted my entire sound

4645
02:47:50,340 --> 02:47:53,740
system while I was gone for the whole weekend it did not realize I was trying

4646
02:47:53,740 --> 02:47:57,620
to call you guys that's okay it's just you know the joys of live radio what's

4647
02:47:57,620 --> 02:48:01,660
on your mind my friend okay first of all hi I'm Ron well y'all probably know

4648
02:48:01,660 --> 02:48:07,340
me by now but um I would hope so yeah as I'm coming back from my amazing trip

4649
02:48:07,340 --> 02:48:11,660
this weekend and listening to you guys are tuning radio I want to call an

4650
02:48:11,660 --> 02:48:19,740
objection on one of the titles on listless yes DJ hero okay why are we

4651
02:48:19,740 --> 02:48:24,480
objecting to DJ hero you don't need to make that a live experience that's what

4652
02:48:24,480 --> 02:48:29,080
a rave is for they still have those well isn't that isn't that kind of what we

4653
02:48:29,080 --> 02:48:32,600
were joking that the Just Dance thing basically is is that the Just Dance is

4654
02:48:32,600 --> 02:48:37,040
gonna be a rave for kids more or less I think it's gonna be more like the Just

4655
02:48:37,040 --> 02:48:41,760
Dance is gonna be on stage dancing and the kids will be watching it out like a

4656
02:48:41,760 --> 02:48:46,320
special VIP area where you can dance so like we go to a weird Al concert but

4657
02:48:46,320 --> 02:48:50,520
you're still like the performing music though like actual DJs mixing actual

4658
02:48:50,520 --> 02:48:54,320
songs together not just like playing one track to the next but like actually

4659
02:48:54,320 --> 02:48:58,880
doing live mashups and stuff that's actually talent versus some dumbasses

4660
02:48:58,880 --> 02:49:02,760
dressed up like the artists that originally sang those tracks but not

4661
02:49:02,760 --> 02:49:08,720
quite and then dancing to pre-recorded music so so what Jason did on the good

4662
02:49:08,720 --> 02:49:17,000
place for a short time not to spoil anything but basically that right so you

4663
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:21,000
could I think and I think Ramos point is that that does I mean to be fair it does

4664
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:25,200
kind of exist some club I do love Janet's rebound I know I know don't

4665
02:49:25,200 --> 02:49:32,040
spoil all right anyway JD and chat points out there's an event called booty

4666
02:49:32,040 --> 02:49:35,680
NSF that's really what it's called I've heard of this it's a mashup party yeah

4667
02:49:35,680 --> 02:49:38,560
I've always wanted to go to that I've heard of that oh yeah they always they

4668
02:49:38,560 --> 02:49:41,440
talk about that so I I can kind of see where I miss coming from saying that

4669
02:49:41,440 --> 02:49:46,480
event sort of already exists but to be fair to Loki's there is nothing under

4670
02:49:46,480 --> 02:49:50,720
that video game brand perhaps there could be some of that triple-a talent

4671
02:49:50,720 --> 02:49:53,840
that comes in although fat chance but you never know I mean there was that

4672
02:49:53,840 --> 02:49:57,720
there was that legendary press conference here what what year was it

4673
02:49:57,720 --> 02:50:01,780
was 2010 so whenever those games were announced like they had some that's a

4674
02:50:01,780 --> 02:50:06,320
major talent at the staple yeah it was like all these like Eminem and many on

4675
02:50:06,320 --> 02:50:10,200
and all these people like under one roof performing for these games I mean

4676
02:50:10,200 --> 02:50:16,400
Activision probably paid a ton of money for it but didn't go to that I know some

4677
02:50:16,400 --> 02:50:19,520
people I knew went to that I can't remember if Bobby was one of them or not

4678
02:50:19,520 --> 02:50:26,000
I didn't it was one of the years I didn't go so but there you go Rama I

4679
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:29,640
guess that's our our rebuttal although it's it's a fair perspective you're

4680
02:50:29,640 --> 02:50:33,480
right some of that same stuff kind of already exists out there yeah on the

4681
02:50:33,480 --> 02:50:37,920
plus side um they don't have to worry about the cops coming in to break up the

4682
02:50:37,920 --> 02:50:44,300
rave that is true that is true I hey Rama before we let you go you said you

4683
02:50:44,300 --> 02:50:47,200
were on a great trip this weekend is that something for anime jam session

4684
02:50:47,200 --> 02:50:51,200
this week was it a convention or no this is something more like me Persil's

4685
02:50:51,200 --> 02:50:55,880
me just getting away for a while just kind of like my time to relax and

4686
02:50:55,880 --> 02:51:04,720
recharge and get back into the game eat pray beer oh yeah Oh works what Loki I

4687
02:51:04,720 --> 02:51:07,640
just got another the last minute all right well Rama we're gonna let you go

4688
02:51:07,640 --> 02:51:10,720
then I'm glad to hear you had a good trip and we'll check in with you again

4689
02:51:10,720 --> 02:51:15,760
awesome take care of y'all fight all right what'd you have for us Loki last

4690
02:51:15,840 --> 02:51:21,800
chance to get in last chance so there's gonna be a new rewards thing for Sony

4691
02:51:21,800 --> 02:51:27,080
rewards now through the PlayStation Network so guess what now those trophies

4692
02:51:27,080 --> 02:51:32,200
that you're earning they're actually worth something oh so basically you can

4693
02:51:32,200 --> 02:51:37,520
earn some of the PlayStation points they can be redeemed for like PlayStation

4694
02:51:37,520 --> 02:51:41,560
Network vouchers and other things so here's how it works so you get one you

4695
02:51:41,560 --> 02:51:47,160
have 100 silver trophies you can get 100 points or one point per trophy 25

4696
02:51:47,160 --> 02:51:55,600
gold trophies for 250 points or 10 platinum trophies for 1,000 points huh

4697
02:51:55,600 --> 02:52:00,440
so and you can like earn those I guess that's available through the service so

4698
02:52:00,440 --> 02:52:07,560
go in there if you've got some trophies you can get some free points all right

4699
02:52:07,600 --> 02:52:11,640
interesting how that stuff is making rewards in the real world I wonder if

4700
02:52:11,640 --> 02:52:16,000
we'll hear more about that at PSX that would be very interesting but anyway I

4701
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:19,640
notice our phone is not lighting up so I think that's gonna do it for the

4702
02:52:19,640 --> 02:52:25,440
skype line tonight which means our show has about come to an end how sad but I

4703
02:52:25,440 --> 02:52:28,780
want to thank you guys for listening to our show tonight and helping it be a

4704
02:52:28,780 --> 02:52:32,200
success if you guys enjoyed what you heard here at orange launch rated

4705
02:52:32,200 --> 02:52:35,160
tonight don't forget to tell a friend or two about the show help us spread the

4706
02:52:35,280 --> 02:52:38,800
word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice but we can't put those

4707
02:52:38,800 --> 02:52:42,400
voices out there if they're not here to call in and send us emails and

4708
02:52:42,400 --> 02:52:45,760
participate on discord and chat and all the places where we try to get your

4709
02:52:45,760 --> 02:52:49,000
voices in on the show and vote in listless they were not a part of that

4710
02:52:49,000 --> 02:52:53,720
scientific process maybe something else maybe hotline Miami would have won if

4711
02:52:53,720 --> 02:52:57,960
more of you would have voted for it so anyway tell a friend or two about the

4712
