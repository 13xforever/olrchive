243200	246360	and talk about our weeks and all that good stuff let's kick it off let's kick
246360	249560	off tonight's show talking about the Super Nintendo classic which is kind of
249560	253360	what's dominating the gaming news cycle this week because I know a lot of folks
253360	258320	were very much anticipating this and I think the big question out there was was
258320	262800	Nintendo going to fuck this up on second thought I think I do have some of these
262800	267480	other games so dark Sakura dark soccer now we talked a little bit about this at
267480	271680	the tail end of Bobby Black Wolf tonight but you you're for now anyway passing on
271680	276160	this Super Nintendo classic just because you and anybody who's listening to olr
276160	279840	for a while kind of knows you and the hubby collect video games obsessively at
279840	284200	least the old stuff especially well we did and now we kind of don't need to
284200	287480	collect anything anymore well meaning that okay so when I say that like the
287480	290560	retro stuff obsessively so you stopped at a certain point so maybe your
290560	294440	collection when it comes to PlayStation 3 isn't as impressive but you stopped
294440	299320	collecting like 10 years ago no was out no every game that they ever made except
299320	302640	for we haven't really actively sought out anything unless if something was a
302640	308240	super good deal yeah you know or you know it was well holy hell we're at a
308240	311640	thrift store and someone is selling a Super Nintendo with Pocky and fucking
311640	317080	rocky too do you know how much that game is by itself yeah it's crazy like 300
317080	321560	bucks yeah unboxed yeah and we got one for 50 bucks with a pile of other games
321560	324800	and another fucking Super Nintendo because somebody didn't know what it was
324800	331560	worth hello goodwill thank you yeah so but because okay but you built up this
331560	336240	collection then essentially accident in the 90s in the early 2000s mostly in
336240	342000	the early on yeah so and it doesn't all go bad they're all cartridges well they
342000	345640	haven't rotted they yellow but they haven't rotten they have some disc rod
345640	349600	on some laser discs but our cartridges are eternal so so you don't really have
349600	353840	a need for this not really enough played Star Fox to have played the the fan
353840	360280	excuse me hiccup fan translation hmm and it's fun it's okay I don't think I'd pay
360360	364440	80 bucks just for Star Fox too that's just one of those little like it's just
364440	369920	a little like it's a little cute little cute little dot on the cupcake it's one
369920	376480	of those little cinnamon hots okay oh but I'm looking over the lip I don't
376480	383480	like fake cinnamon I'm looking over the list and I mean I'm really trying not to
383480	389440	do the toot my own horn thing hmm but I truly believe like the only game on here
389440	394240	that I'm not sure if I own other than of course Star Fox 2 because it no one
394240	401480	owns a legit cartridge copy of it hello right um is I think we don't have Kirby
401480	406080	superstar I think I do have Kirby's Dream Course that's funny because I have
406080	410360	Kirby's Dream Course and my collection is nothing I think I have Kirby's Dream
410360	414160	Course I think I don't have superstar which is a travesty I'm pretty sure we
414160	419360	have Contra 3 somewhere so so all this SNES classic made you do is realize shit
419360	425440	we need to find a copy of Kirby superstar pretty much I mean okay but
425440	428240	let me let me ask you there's only one game on here I really don't care about
428240	431280	let me ask you this and if you don't want to toot your own horn take yourself
431280	434080	out of your shoes for a minute put yourself in my shoes now I played the
434080	437600	Super Nintendo I love the Super Nintendo but I didn't build up the collection you
437600	440760	did I kind of took a break from gaming in the early 2000s because that's when I
440760	444080	was in college and I just I didn't really rediscover my love game to extra
444080	448280	in college I know but I didn't really rediscover my love for gaming until you
448280	450920	know I took a few year break and then like DDR kind of brought me back right
450920	455400	and here we are you know all these years later but you know if if I don't have
455400	459400	all those games but I have memories of playing these games in my friends houses
459400	462640	do you see where this is more appealing to me I totally do yeah I know and keep
462640	467880	in mind if I didn't have at least half of the games on here yeah hell yeah I'd
467880	473780	be all kinds of hot for one okay and we do we've asked our our buddy you know
473780	478100	hey you get another one in let us know yeah you know it'd be great to have but
478100	485300	our nest classic is it's still sealed we have not opened it it is on a shelf
485300	490500	on top of I want to say a stack of Genesis games and that's hilarious you
490500	493220	know some people who still can't get one that now they're gonna hate you for that
493220	498420	comment but no it's it's it's it also well you have to also look at the
498420	502260	perspective it is a collectible item and sometimes you don't open collectibles you
502260	506420	like you know there's some people don't open their amiibos that's stupid well
506420	510020	my amiibos are actually no all my amiibos except for my Animal Crossing
510020	513340	ones because I got all the Animal Crossing ones right right and I got all
513340	518140	the the Kirby Planet Robobot ones but I was gonna say if I was in your shoes and
518140	522620	I had the big impressive collection then I probably would pass on this you're
522620	525660	right there wouldn't really be like what is there to drop 80 bucks on the only
525660	530820	thing I could remotely think of is well a the cute I mean it is it's adorable
530820	533360	the little thing is adorable the little Super Nintendo even though doesn't like
533360	536020	the eject button doesn't really work but it's cute but the only thing I can think
536020	539820	of is that like the the fact that it's HDMI native and doesn't have to be run
539820	543740	through converters yeah that's cool I mean that's what we were talking about
543740	548640	making it worthwhile for yeah because we can't play it on our 4k TV without
548640	554380	there being significant lag a twist and see that was what we ran ran into when
554380	561040	we did the NES marathon for I think Dan was doing it for Child's Play just you
561040	565260	know games all day and I was trying to play the Guardian Legend and I was like
565260	570820	fuck I don't remember my my what's the word I'm thinking my reaction time being
570820	575100	this slow and it turns out there's like a one to two second delay using the
575100	581620	converter and that just makes games like that practically unplayable you know but
581620	585860	I mean if we did another one probably run it through though you know we we
585860	590500	picked up a Vega for like 10 bucks at a thrift store an age ago mm-hmm and I'm
590500	596540	sure well your ex-roommate had a Vega right oh the one I try to forget yes
596540	601540	well sorry no it was the house for a while yeah I know I know money Melrose
601540	609420	place yes yeah um but that was it's been great because it's really high def for
609420	614620	what it is and we've been able to play on it so I mean it's just like do I want
614620	619420	to sit on the couch and play or do I just want to go in the game room and sit
619420	624300	on one of those chairs that Dan you know ripped out of old Honda Prelude to
624300	628140	make his driving rig out of back in the day still the driving rig by the way but
628140	632500	we still have the prelude seats on boxes let me get to some of the comments from
632500	635820	our chat over at live dog vog network comm vid power feeling good about the
635820	639380	SNES classic saying my friend and I played the SNES classic all day
639380	645460	yesterday yummy miss nostalgia all day fuck consoles in our chat no tell me how
645460	652140	you really feel says NES mini plus SNES mini equals $160 raspberry pi does both
652140	656140	and is $35 and can do both get a man who can do both
656140	660660	okay no man I think that's right I am an independent person who doesn't need a
660660	664980	man but anyway look all that joking aside like and I I just I have to
664980	667060	address this because it was a really funny article it was going around
667060	671980	Twitter and Facebook this week I mean the whole like um you too can get a
671980	676300	Raspberry Pi and never shut the fuck up about it and all that stuff like I I get
676300	680580	that perspective of using the emulator it's a valid perspective if I couldn't
680580	684460	get my hands on an SNES mini and I've said this on the show many times I would
684460	687860	have been left with no other choice than to steal it and it would that would have
687860	692380	been doing the Raspberry Pi option because I mean sugarcoat it all you want
692380	697020	unless you own all those games you're putting on your ROMs you are or I see
697020	701740	me putting on your Raspberry Pi you are engaging in I mean it's it's very it's
701740	706540	very gray area and it's you know but but it is it's piracy I mean let's just
706540	710140	put the word on it it's piracy but I would have done it too you're copying
710140	714820	that floppy right but I would have done it too if I couldn't pick up one of
714820	719140	these things but if Nintendo did not want me to have one but I will say this
719140	724260	there's a few things to be said about the fact that it is official the fact
724260	727860	that it is a cute little collectible that the little you know device itself
727860	733260	is is great and it is an official Nintendo product and so forth like I all
733260	738100	those things are you know appealing to me in a way just as a longtime gaming
738100	743700	fan I want the stuff that's you know available by Nintendo now will I have to
743700	747660	use a Raspberry Pi to play the stuff that I know Nintendo is never gonna put
747660	752100	out on any type of like like let's say I want to play Pocky and Rocky 2 like that
752100	755940	game is just never coming back that's why it's so you know so if I want to
755940	758420	play that I'm gonna have to use Raspberry Pi I don't have another
758420	763460	choice but you know for these games that you know were and I gotta say it's a
763460	766780	pretty impressive list of games I told Dark Soccer I wanted to do a thing here
766780	768820	at the top of the show where I said okay I want you to take three of those games
768820	771820	and strike them and tell me what three games you'd put on it and Jimmy's like I
771820	775400	can't do it no there's one on there I would get rid of well okay one which one
775400	779580	it would be Contra 3 Contra 3 because it's not really the greatest Contra
779580	784500	game right I would probably put say content to three on it okay well that's
784500	790740	well or that's chance but Kirby's Avalanche okay three Kirby games Jamie
790740	797420	three Kirby games fuck yeah why why not just a Kirby classic you know I wonder
797420	801380	I wonder if this is where you know I haven't even got to the news store I
801380	804340	want to read but I wonder if this is where Nintendo might go with this next
804340	810100	like I know everybody's expecting an n64 classic but I'm gonna throw a
810100	817220	different option out there maybe for 2018 Nintendo might look at doing a
817220	822260	Mario classic and what it's gonna be it'll be like a little Mario head or
822260	825780	some really cute little Mario collectible Kirby but and what will be
825780	830060	built into it is gonna be like let's say some of the things are you know what you
830060	834020	know what that SNES classic is missing that's a really big void in it Super
834020	837020	Mario Brothers all-stars it's completely missing from that now all
837020	840860	those games are in the NES classic but anyway they could do a Mario classic
840860	844660	that has those Mario World Yoshi's Island yes I know all these things
844660	848740	already exist but maybe they throw in a couple other the Mario side story stuff
848740	852180	and then how about where's Mario everyone's favorite Mario is missing
852180	858220	Mario is missing yeah whatever I do but then do Mario 64 is also going to be in
858220	861660	it and I bet that would be thing and then they could do a Zelda classic that
861660	866140	would have all the Zelda games and Ogrina of Time and maybe Majora's Mask
866140	870900	as well that may be a direction Nintendo goes in that would be my prediction if I
870900	875020	was at Nintendo and I was like what you know do we want to do an n64 classic I
875020	881140	just an n64 classic would probably not have as many games on it I know it
881140	884780	sounds really shady but if they if they can't get the third-party licensing to
884780	887780	have shit like Goldeneye on it which I don't think they would be like I don't
887780	890460	think they can get Goldeneye on it you know and some of the other stuff I don't
890740	896820	I don't know if it's gonna be as must have lost the license for the likenesses
896820	901220	in Goldeneye actually I think they've lost the licenses for the name mm-hmm I
901220	905340	know there was a bunch of a bunch of stuff that went around oh why oh it's
905340	914020	had some problems getting re-released but crap there was another I think that
914020	919180	they'd have some trouble doing some of the n64 games unless well no they
919500	921980	wouldn't because they'd probably have enough memory built in for instead of
921980	928660	the expansion port but I don't see them going the route of doing an n64 classic
928660	933420	but we'll see I feel like Nintendo is gonna why ride this wave another year
933420	937140	one way or another so we'll see really they're riding on the coattails of Atari
937140	941940	mm-hmm you know with the Atari flashback mm-hmm it's it's stuff that's already
941940	947020	been done it's just finally they're like oh there's call for it let's do it all
947020	951940	right well so to talk a little bit more specifically about what's going on in
951940	956540	the news and the blogs about the SNES classic this week it sounds like overall
956540	961700	the experience is going better for people and granted everybody's issue is
961700	965060	different because like even I notice in chat over at live dog network calm we
965060	968860	have everyone got a mini but me man which I think is break man so I think
968860	972220	there are some people that are still frustrated I do hear Amazon made a big
972220	976340	screw-up that messed some people over so I think some people are still salty
976340	980900	about that and I acknowledge that I get that but it sounds like the big picture
980900	985500	is a lot less people are salty this time there were salty about the NES classic
985500	990140	and I think those that are salty now if if they want to still I mean some people
990140	993060	may just say you know what fuck fuck this whole thing and bow out and that's
993060	996300	fine but those that want to stick with it I think probably will end up with an
996300	1001620	SNES classic you know sooner rather than later so I kind of feel like the vibe
1001620	1005420	out there is genuinely you know positive us gamer kind of did a little
1005420	1009980	compilation compiling of all these different stories kind of looking at
1009980	1012700	different boards and things like that and people overall were pretty much
1012700	1016900	saying you know it was it was way better basically this time things things were
1016900	1021900	doing better this time you know the lines were there but you know it was
1021900	1025340	kind of manageable most people were able to get one if they showed up even you
1025340	1028940	know an hour beforehand or what have you you didn't have to camp out all night
1028940	1032060	although of course many people did especially at places like the official
1032060	1039740	Nintendo store and some of that stuff so anyhow also I'm noticing in chat
1039740	1042540	they're talking about how Mario is missing is really not that great of a
1042540	1046460	game it's not it's edutainment it's for small children yeah I know it was it's
1046460	1050540	uh it's the Donkey Kong jr. math of the Super Nintendo era it's like it's
1050540	1053900	trying to be where in the world is Carmen Sandiego with Mario but that's
1053900	1058220	actually a really good analogy and but but Carmen Sandiego you could type and
1058220	1061780	you can't really do that on super yeah that's what makes it but you see what I
1061780	1067100	mean though yeah it's meant to be secret you know education ooh do you want to
1067100	1069260	talk a little bit here I know we've addressed it but you want to talk a
1069260	1072700	little bit here about the Star Fox thing at the top of the list there oh yeah
1072700	1080780	Star Fox um so the the ROMs already been dumped you knew how is this I mean I'm
1080780	1084620	saying this tongue-in-cheek obviously it is news it made all the wires up there
1084620	1087860	but I'm saying it tongue-in-cheek how is this news because hackers are gonna hack
1087900	1092540	we all know that right it's it's we knew it was gonna happen right away how
1092540	1097460	quickly did they get the the nest mini figured out oh before it was on shelves
1097460	1100900	just like this pretty much thing somebody took one of those things home
1100900	1104500	early that was in a store somewhere that had a connection and dumped it before
1104500	1110260	the thing was even out well and also they got it extracted to a dev cart mm-hmm
1110340	1118020	and they had an RGB modded SNES hooked up and also the dev cart they has is
1118020	1125540	super FX to dev cart and got it running on a Super Nintendo so it works there's
1125540	1130820	a video of it and everything so I am completely not surprised and you know
1130820	1134220	the one thing I'm waiting for is to see now how much capacity for you know more
1134220	1140460	games does it have on it how how how much longer until they figure out how to
1140460	1144300	get more games loaded on it or create like a ROM loader or something like that
1144300	1148660	so only a matter of time probably not too long I hear a lot of the technology
1148660	1153020	in there is very similar to what already exists on the NES mini so I'm sure that
1153020	1155620	I think they think they've already had some there's like a whole reddit
1155620	1158420	dedicated to the hacking the Super Nintendo classic and I think they've
1158420	1162500	already had some type of like limited success with it so probably I would say
1162500	1167180	I don't know if I would go in and hack mine today but I'll give it a month or
1167180	1171460	two for everything to kind of iron out and then we'll see I'm kind of torn on
1171460	1177220	the issue because you know a do I really need to do that be do I want to you know
1177220	1181660	quote unquote taint the collectible I guess for lack of better term by doing
1181660	1185500	that to it so I don't know I'm gonna kind of just give it a couple months and
1185500	1190000	see what I want to do but no and I I'll share the video with everyone in the
1190000	1194280	chat room because it's just neat the guys shows the cartridge he has and
1194280	1199080	everything and then loads up the game and it works on a Super Nintendo so hey
1199080	1203080	Tiger claw and chat over at live dog network comm says sky but first try to
1203080	1206920	beat every single game on the SNES mini before you do that you know it's funny
1206920	1212620	I have good luck with Contra I've beaten a lot of them prior but yeah I mean I
1212620	1215220	think it would be fun it would be if I'm sure I'm not the only one I'm sure I'm
1215220	1217800	by far not the only one thinking this there's probably hundreds of people
1217960	1221440	doing this but I thought it would be a fun little like streaming thing to
1221440	1225600	actually stream beating you know all the games on there at least the ones that I
1225600	1229480	can do you're right I don't know if I can do Contra 3 but I'll try I can try
1229480	1233360	but some of those games are gonna take a while like you know don't forget guys
1233360	1238560	things like Final Fantasy 3 6 I know but 3 in this case Final Fantasy 3 and Secret
1238560	1242120	of Mana those games are hours and hours and hours those games are still long
1242120	1246600	games just because they're retro did not suddenly make them faster you know
1246600	1249680	unless you unless you're speedrunning them but I'm not a speedrunner that's
1249680	1252480	not what I would do with them I would play them as if I was playing them for
1252480	1255880	the first time I'm gonna have to check the date on this one because there's a
1255880	1261200	I mean I know that beta 64 is done one on star yeah this is the old one I was
1261200	1265720	hoping that beta 64 would do an updated video of Star Fox 2 you know now that we
1265720	1271560	have a release of it but I don't know because I liked watching the old the old
1271560	1276120	video all right I also learned something new yeah that the Super
1276120	1281600	Nintendo in Australia looks like the Super Famicom oh does it that's the one
1281600	1286260	the one in Europe looks like that too doesn't it yeah yeah same yeah I didn't
1286260	1289720	know it until I didn't even realize it until I saw my friends I would I think
1289720	1292200	those are cute and I wouldn't mind getting one of those but I think it's
1292200	1296400	it's the exact same game lineup I think yeah I think so I think the one in Japan
1296400	1301400	is different just like the NES classic had some different titles in it like
1301440	1306720	for example I know let's see I'm actually pulling it up I know Legend of
1306720	1311840	the Mystical Ninja was on the go him on going on you know and that that is on
1311840	1314840	the Japanese one I'm actually trying to pull up to see what the changes were
1314840	1322960	that they made okay so for our version Japan does not have earthbound Kirby's
1322960	1329520	Dream Course Street Fighter 2 turbo Super Castlevania 4 and Super Punch-Out
1329520	1333600	those are unique for us Japan does not have those but Japan has these five
1333600	1338040	instead going on they have Super Street Fighter 2 the new challengers that's
1338040	1341520	weird we got Street Fighter 2 turbo they got Super Street Fighter 2 that's kind
1341520	1347000	of weird but that's how it worked Japan also got super soccer paneled upon and
1347000	1352880	fire emblem mystery of the emblem those are pretty yeah epic though for I'm
1352880	1358360	really surprised not get mother too and we have that I guess I don't know that
1358360	1361440	it was as big of a deal yeah I guess though as far as RPGs go you're right it
1361440	1364520	probably was that fire m1 was just like the way bigger deal whereas you know
1364520	1368440	earthbound was pretty big here even though the Nintendo still continues to
1368440	1375160	rob us of Earth Mother 3 earthbound to everyone call it so anyway all right hey
1375160	1378320	we talked about games that aren't just Super Nintendo we do play other games
1378320	1381840	too so let's before we get into the rest of this week's gaming news let's talk
1381840	1384880	about how is your gaming week and the types of video games that you've been
1384880	1388200	playing this week so dark soccer oh did you get to play some games well actually
1388200	1393560	really the past two weeks you were here yeah um I well it's like I I mentioned
1393560	1398440	before I bought clubhead haven't had a chance to start it yet but I'm really
1398440	1401120	looking forward to that because that's the game I've been waiting for for a
1401120	1410800	while um I I quit Wow a couple of weeks ago what else did I play I'm still
1410800	1418160	playing idle pouring on my phone because it's actually ridiculously fun and how
1418160	1423760	it's like all of the parts of an MMO without actually having to play it if
1423760	1427120	that makes sense I mean you play it but you don't have to do the running around
1427120	1434440	annoying part and you know your quests are kind of different so I'm also I'm
1434440	1438840	still kind of playing me Tomo and Pokemon go I participated in a raid all
1438840	1442440	by myself and it was my first raid ever and it was the one around the corner
1442440	1447920	from Rob's house that I did on the way here did you it was it like a magic
1447920	1452480	carp or something no it was a bay leaf okay so like one of the one stars that
1452480	1456560	you can do by yourself and I caught him to good job with whatever that white
1456560	1461760	ball is premier ball you know whatever it's white white balls at least it's not
1461760	1470280	wrinkly your milky white balls yes okay um I also I got danganronpa v3 and I
1470280	1477280	started it but I think I'm going to stream all the parts of it that I do so
1477280	1484640	I will be playing it a lot more slowly than I wanted to but and I was thinking
1484640	1488160	because I was I started it on a Wednesday because I started with the
1488160	1491480	demo which I still need to finish the demo I'm not gonna do the demo trial I'm
1491480	1496680	just gonna play it on my own but I'm gonna start with v3 I was supposed to do
1496680	1500640	it on Wednesdays but I'm going to see gorillas on Wednesday oh shut up where
1500640	1506640	at San Francisco oh it's gonna be fun cuz my friend Crystal got an extra
1506640	1513000	ticket oh and I couldn't the same crystal I know yeah yes same crystal I
1513000	1519440	know right yeah uh-huh um got got an extra ticket and so I was like hell yeah
1519440	1525400	I want to go so we're like we're going like heck yeah awesome so I wanted to
1525400	1531360	see gorillas for like 12 fucking years so it's happening boo yeah so and they
1531360	1534600	do it just for people that are like isn't that a cartoon man they yes they
1534600	1538680	do like the hologram they do the um to pocket Coachella thing right they know
1538680	1542760	how they're doing it for this one oh really the one that they did last year
1542760	1547120	was like they used to have like the big screen and everyone playing behind the
1547120	1551000	screen Hatsune Miku it's like a Hatsune Miku if they do it if they do it hollow
1551000	1555800	like that and then I get to see Damon Auburn in person I'm like oh so I'll be
1555800	1563360	happy because I was also a big blur fan in the 90s but not to digress too much
1563360	1572400	from the game thing I we got a pinball we got a pinball mm-hmm we got a
1572400	1577720	medieval madness congrats dates the re-release it's got like the color LCD
1577720	1583520	screen and all that and what the digital screen and it's got like the black trim
1583520	1589280	on it it's I think one of the tournament editions but I kind of beat Dan on the
1589280	1594760	game today like I don't beat Dan at pinball like ever and I beat him by like
1594760	1602080	a million points today it was pretty fun and we're having to fix Star Trek so but
1602080	1607160	yeah we have a medieval madness in our living room now fun the collection grows
1607160	1616000	I'd like to go to Disneyland but Dan keeps buying pinball tables I'm just
1616000	1620880	giving him a hard time I super I super love pinball and I really you know if
1620880	1626920	they redid theater of magic oh heck yeah mm-hmm I I have like three or four the
1626920	1631880	table is so fucking good sorry I want theater magic of the four that are on my
1631880	1637400	list huh it would be theater magic huh it would be bright of pinbot 2.0 it's
1637400	1640320	the one that's got the conversion in it that has like the extra modes and
1640320	1647400	everything mm-hmm black rose the one with a cannon and everything and I'd
1647400	1652920	really like a Big Bang bar but those are even the repros are expensive so I think
1652920	1656440	you know I don't collect pinball machines yet wink but I think my dream
1656440	1661840	list would be baby Pac-Man baby Pac-Man pinbot the original I used to have one
1661840	1666880	and the theater magic I think that's on almost everybody's list magic is
1666880	1671600	expensive now it's a great table though and probably ten grand for one magic is
1671600	1676040	Scheherazade I think or what was the genius share what does that one the that
1676040	1679840	went with a big lamp in the middle that spins I'll look it up I think it was
1679840	1684400	though like magic of Scheherazade yeah something like that so that's and that
1684400	1689400	that one I really like to Oh maybe Adams family Adams family is good but it is
1689400	1693440	pricey it is well it's so like I know I'm naming a bunch of cliche tables but
1693440	1697320	these are like these are my memories from you know many years ago and well
1697320	1700660	don't forget people in California the Golden State pinball festivals coming up
1700660	1706000	next year not all the way for next year I'll mark my count in Lodi Wow okay it
1706000	1711720	was it we used to be Pinagogo in Dixon yeah and the owner of the event I think
1711720	1717940	sold it or gave it to somebody else and so they moved to Lodi in an
1717940	1723660	air-conditioned facility that doesn't have corn pollen in it thank you God for
1723660	1728700	it's now like Golden State pinball Expo or something I'll get news for it and
1728700	1731980	post it and our to see it points out in our chat room at live dog network calm
1731980	1737780	surely they have pins it it's a bunch of pinball absolutely but Golden State
1737780	1743700	pinball festival is pinball yeah exclusive yes all right anything else
1743700	1749580	for your gaming week no all right I'll talk about my gaming week then I will
1749580	1753260	I'll be a little I'm gonna do pinball too but I'll be a little less on it than
1753260	1756820	dark soccer but I did play because it just came out this week pinball FX 3
1756820	1760980	just came out and so I downloaded it on Steam and if you didn't already know it
1760980	1765060	imports a lot of the stuff that worked with pinball FX 2 I think some of the
1765060	1770060	license stuff doesn't totally carry over but I mean like the Marvel stuff does
1770140	1773740	the Star Wars stuff does there's a lot of it that does come over so that's
1773740	1777460	pretty cool so I was you know playing some of those tables and so it's kind of
1777460	1780380	like well what's different what's new about it well they have some more like
1780380	1782780	competitive modes which I thought was cool is that you can do like a little
1782780	1789260	tournament which was excuse me very similar to the Bethesda pinball app
1789260	1793500	which some of those tables are in a separate app on iPhone and Android where
1793500	1796780	you can kind of like play other people and if you beat their score you get
1796820	1800300	season ranking points you're basically playing like a seasonal challenge type
1800300	1803580	thing and I thought that was cool so I was playing a little bit of that so yeah
1803580	1808060	I dabbled in but but the problem is I can't do every table in the season
1808060	1812820	because I don't own all the tables so that's you know pinball FX if you didn't
1812820	1817900	already know is free to play except you don't I don't know if it comes with any
1817900	1823060	tables for free I think you can demo tables all of them for free but you have
1823060	1827500	to actually purchase tables a la carte but one of the humble bundles a year or
1827500	1832300	two ago had like 15 tables in one of the humble bundles and that's where I think
1832300	1838940	I built my PC collection I have a pretty decent collection on PlayStation 4 as
1838940	1844020	well but you know just from what I've collected over that era but thanks that
1844020	1847940	humble bundle I have a ton on PC as well and Bobby Blackwolf and chat pointing
1847940	1851540	out that sorcerers lair is free so there is one free one in there so that's
1851540	1854620	pretty cool that they give you at least one and that is one of the tables that's
1854620	1858300	in the tournament right now so you can even participate in the tournament just
1858300	1862220	with the free tables that's pretty cool so I played a little bit of that I want
1862220	1866100	to tell this story so I went I'm so tired today you guys because I took a
1866100	1870500	trip yesterday to San Francisco and part of it was Rocky Horror related so I was
1870500	1874780	up really late last night supporting the show over there but what we did earlier
1874780	1879060	in the day when my pal JD who's been on the show before we took a trip over to
1879260	1883340	Oakland and we actually went to the Museum of Art and Digital Entertainment
1883340	1886900	which I never been to before I guess it's been around for like years and I
1886900	1890820	not been over there but they were having their sixth anniversary special and JD
1890820	1893180	found out about it on Facebook it was like Rob there's like a video game
1893180	1897220	museum in Oakland I was like there is oh yeah I think I have heard of this and we
1897220	1902940	just never fucking been so we went and it was cool like it's just um it's a lot
1902940	1907700	of like it was basically okay dark Sakura imagine if your vault was the
1907700	1912220	size of the house and you let strangers come in to play whatever games they
1912220	1917060	wanted that was kind of the museum which I thought was kind of neat so but I was
1917060	1920540	I was in problems but there's a part of me that's kind of like man what's the
1920540	1923860	security like in this place because there's a lot of stuff that's not behind
1923860	1926980	glass cases and I was like there's a lot of games on there they must have
1926980	1930080	something that they don't they don't share the secrets with but yeah I had a
1930080	1932940	good time when I went over and just you know looking at all the classic stuff
1932940	1935700	and I did get my hands on something I did play even though there were quite a
1935740	1939940	few people there I couldn't play everything but I did play and I know the
1939940	1942740	first words out of Jamie's mouth watch are gonna be like why don't you just come
1942740	1948860	over and play that at my house but the thing that I played was pac-man on a
1948860	1955260	Atari 800 computer I don't have one really an Atari 800 okay by the way the
1955260	1957940	game you're thinking of is tales of the Arabian Nights oh that's because
1957940	1963380	Scheherazade was an RPG on the NES yes I can see how I get those two confused I
1963380	1967180	love I knew Scheherazade okay tales of Arabian Nights that is it thank you for
1967180	1972980	correcting me on that okay but anyway uh where was I so pack I we played pac-man
1972980	1977300	on the Atari 800 because why not it was available and it was like hey this is
1977300	1982400	old and it was actually it's it's a decent translation of pac-man believe it
1982400	1987740	or not so yeah all right so yeah I had a good time at the museum so props to
1987740	1992260	those guys over in Oakland they are located in Oakland at 3400 Broadway you
1992260	1996040	can check out more information at the maid org I might reach out to them to
1996040	1999020	see if we can get one of those guys on the show in the coming weeks to talk a
1999020	2001340	little more about what it is they do over there because I thought it was
2001340	2005020	pretty cool because one of the things I liked most about it was that I saw a lot
2005020	2010980	of like people my age and their 30s late 30s bringing their kids and introducing
2010980	2014300	their kids to old games so it's like you're gonna play pac-man the way I
2014300	2017580	played pac-man I thought that was really cool you're gonna cry just like we did
2017580	2022460	exactly so yeah I thought I thought that was really cool so props to those
2022460	2026860	guys um as far as other stuff I don't know if I played a lot of other new
2026860	2030520	stuff I guess two small things on Nintendo switch because they released a
2030520	2036540	ton of stuff on Nintendo switch this week so I did pick up Mario Brothers in
2036540	2041140	the arcade archives because you remember a couple weeks ago and Nintendo did that
2041140	2044420	Nintendo direct and they mentioned that hey this arcade archives thing that's
2044420	2048660	been all these neo geo games we're gonna expand that to Nintendo made arcade
2048660	2053780	games from you know 83 and 84 in that era so Mario Brothers is the first one
2053780	2057500	they put out and yes Mario Brothers has been out in several forms it was on the
2057500	2062820	NES and then they it's it's in like it's in every frickin Mario advance they've
2062820	2068420	done since then but nothing seems to recreate the original quite so well
2068420	2071820	especially down to the sounds and the fact that the sound in that game was
2071820	2075340	actually kind of garbage but that was the charm of it was that it was so
2075340	2080340	garbage that the coin noises it's just like really like messed up but it's
2080340	2084540	that's part of the charm of it it really took me back to being at the roller rink
2084540	2088600	and playing arcade games and dating myself but what my roller rink game was
2088600	2094140	right no I forget Frogger oh to the day that I can't play Frogger well unless
2094140	2098620	I'm on roller skates my biggest one was spy hunter which always cracked me up
2098620	2104580	because I had the pedal with roller skates exactly we had a stand-up pole
2104580	2110520	position there but it was always broken um the Babalu in Dothan Alabama and then
2110520	2114740	I also bought p-cross on the Nintendo switch I think it's called p-cross s is
2114740	2117980	the actual name of it but I thought it's a cheap little game and it's one of
2117980	2121180	those nice little games that's like oh I can pull the switch out while I'm like
2121180	2125940	lying in bed and this is a good game to be able to play before I fall asleep but
2125940	2131660	I need to stop I need to stop buying new games because it's fucking holding me
2131660	2135140	back from finishing Samus Returns and this is an issue I need to go back and
2135140	2138660	finish Samus Returns but there's one other game I got pulled into this week
2138660	2141420	that I need to mention one other quick thing because it was one of those games
2141420	2145700	was like I didn't play enough of this a year ago and it came out so I'm gonna
2145700	2148900	just fucking fall down the rabbit hole hard this week and I played a lot of it
2148900	2151900	over the last weekend and stuff last weekend not this weekend but the week
2151900	2157220	before civilization six that's right remember civilization and how addicted
2157220	2159980	we all get to that game and somehow I only played it a little bit when it
2159980	2162660	first came out but then I just kind of resisted and there was all this other
2162660	2165820	games coming out and I was able to stay away from it well this week I was kind
2165820	2169860	of sitting there looking at steam and civ6 started saying come play me
2169860	2172380	actually do you know what it really was do you know what it was that brought me
2172380	2176300	back to civilization that made me think about it I don't know if you guys have
2176300	2180820	watched Star Trek discovery yet but the opening credits made me think of
2180820	2184900	civilization I don't know why but they did like just like that the animation
2184900	2188900	made me think of like the intro to like Civ 4 or something like I don't know
2188900	2193260	this weird like connect in my mind I was like I need to go play civilization and
2193260	2196380	I do that I do that sometimes do you guys ever do that have you ever seen
2196380	2199300	like a movie or something and it's like it's not as like it's not necessarily
2199300	2203660	like you go see Resident Evil and you're like I need to play Resident Evil like I
2203660	2207940	remember when I went and I saw the movie stardust in theaters I immediately had
2207940	2211700	to come home and play Elder Scrolls Oblivion like have you ever had like
2211700	2216140	something like trigger you to go like I need to play that game kind of would do
2216140	2221020	anything you can think of I'm looking at our chat over at live dot vog network
2221020	2223900	calm to see if anybody has one although I know we're a little delay no but
2223900	2232340	crawl made me want to play D&D which one crawl I saw it in the theater as a kid
2232340	2236260	but every time I see it I just want to break out you know the rule book and
2236260	2240660	find people who want to do you know second edition with me everyone got a
2240660	2244260	mini but me man in chat says I watched Friday the 13th and wanted to go home
2244260	2250180	and play operation actually you know what I always won't play splatter house
2250180	2256100	oh yeah why the stupid Friday the 13th game splatter fucking house splatter
2256100	2261420	house splatter house kind of was Friday the 13th wink wink not it was much
2261420	2265220	better than the game that had the name on it I love the NES one I don't give a
2265220	2269220	fuck like I know people hate on the game all the time and I understand it is not
2269220	2272980	a good game let me make that clear but there's a certain charm to it I just I
2272980	2278740	can't get away from it's so good all right anyhow uh let's move on I want to
2278740	2282300	talk a little more about some announcements here and then we'll get

2286220	2291940	olr we're also on facebook facebook.com slash orange lounge radio I think we

2300060	2304500	November 11th 12th maybe gone that weekend but unsure yet so we'll keep it
2304500	2308860	posted because that's still over a month away so meanwhile we are gonna get into
2308860	2311940	some gaming news let's do it let's start off tonight Loki's not here tonight so
2311940	2317460	I'll start off tonight and let's oh what going you said the Loki's not here I
2317460	2321380	know it's sad it is sad all right I'm still cuter he'll be back he'll be back
2321380	2327140	next week so it sounds like folks that are in the Nintendo creators program I
2327140	2330900	don't know if you remember this but this is a program that Nintendo wanted people
2330900	2335220	to sign up for to basically validate their YouTube streams and enter a sort
2335220	2338700	of revenue share with Nintendo and it was the way that Nintendo was going to
2338700	2344140	stop basically like copyright claiming your videos all the time and and doing
2344140	2347820	the monetization and that I am really oversimplifying the situation here for
2347820	2353500	time so sorry but apparently folks that are in that program actually got sent an
2353500	2361260	email talking about that live streams can no longer be done what yeah
2361260	2365020	Nintendo's creator program sent an email that goes like this thank you for using
2365020	2368220	the Nintendo creators program we've updated the Nintendo creators program
2368220	2371500	user guide with information on how revenue generated during live stream
2371500	2375580	broadcasts on YouTube will be handled in the Nintendo creators program live
2375580	2379180	streaming on YouTube falls outside the scope of the Nintendo creators program
2379180	2383500	this means that you cannot broadcast content on YouTube live from the account
2383500	2386700	that you've registered to the Nintendo creators program please check the user
2386700	2391620	guide for details thank you for your support blah blah blah blah blah like so
2391620	2396820	what what does Nintendo have against their content creators doing live
2396820	2401780	streams and that I guess is the piece that I'm not really figuring out like
2401780	2406700	why did they maybe you guys know in our chat room over at live.vognetware.com
2406700	2413340	but why did Nintendo suddenly decide to pull the plug on this did something go
2413340	2417500	on where maybe like in a live stream something kind of nefarious and bad was
2417500	2421300	going on and bad words were said and things like that during a Nintendo game
2421300	2425580	and maybe Nintendo can't really monitor that stuff effectively I'm not sure what
2425580	2430340	it is I feel like it's got to be a control thing at the end of the day yeah
2430380	2433700	and that's what dark to see in our chat room kind of things over at live.vognetware.com
2433700	2437700	maybe live streams are harder to police I'm really not sure
2437700	2443180	Kaijuto says this this freaking streaming out tube game cutscenes BS is
2443180	2448020	getting out of hand let's see vidpower in chat says does
2448020	2451780	Nintendo's policy cover twitch as well well what's interesting about that is
2451780	2456940	that the creators program wasn't for twitch it was for YouTube and all of the
2456980	2460660	content that goes up on there because that's the on-demand content and
2460660	2466580	obviously YouTube had their monetization program in advance kind of before twitch
2466580	2470980	had theirs I mean twitch had the partner program but the twitch stuff has really
2470980	2475740	blown up with the affiliation and the bits and subscribers through all that
2475740	2479500	program so I'm not sure Nintendo has figured out how to battle the whole
2479500	2484220	twitch thing or if they can but I wonder if that's not gonna be something that
2484220	2487700	doesn't happen before the end of the year maybe it's kind of starting with
2487700	2493020	this YouTube thing but certainly that's one of the places my gut goes is well
2493020	2497660	are these YouTube creators then just gonna go over to twitch although I don't
2497660	2501180	know that might be a really hard thing to do to have your audience go with you
2501180	2504820	you know like that's you don't want to risk losing your audience over a move
2504820	2509380	like that I don't know tiger claw chat says this is why streaming on YouTube
2509380	2513220	isn't a good idea to begin with everything is all nice and dandy on
2513260	2517260	twitch well I don't think YouTube would want to think they think about it like
2517260	2520980	that and then where does mixer fit into all of this and I know there's an easy
2520980	2527100	joke to make there about it doesn't because nobody in the mixer but the
2527100	2531740	reality is Microsoft is not gonna stop pushing mixer and mixer does have some
2531740	2536340	things that you know separated apart from the competition so you know we have
2536340	2540060	to consider that as well how is mixer gonna fit in all that whole equation
2540260	2544260	probably whatever ends up happening to twitch is gonna happen a mixer but we'll
2544260	2549780	see I don't know so there you go that's something that's happened I don't know
2549780	2553340	what the future holds for the streaming program Dark Sakura do you think
2553340	2559540	Nintendo needs to stop doing this to their streaming population the people
2559540	2563600	that evangelize their games or does Nintendo have the fucking right to say
2563600	2568060	our games our rules Nintendo has the right to say our games our rules but
2568100	2573620	they need to be willing to give a little bit to their fan base you know there has
2573620	2578860	to be a balance and I think that they're just taking that we need all the control
2578860	2585460	ever to all the things line that they always do so I mean it's not really a
2585460	2590140	should they or should they not it's a they've already done it it doesn't
2590140	2594300	matter what we think they should do does that make sense no no I mean totally it
2594300	2597380	does I mean you're right we can whine and bitch and moan all we want but at
2597380	2601100	the end of the day Nintendo can do do whatever they want to do with their
2601100	2605420	copyright but Jamie I guess an important you know thing to keep in mind is that
2605420	2610860	these YouTube creators then in turn have the right to ask themselves do I want to
2610860	2615420	keep supporting Nintendo or am I gonna tell them to fuck off I mean and that
2615420	2619420	will be the interesting thing as a result of this but it's I think it's
2619420	2625260	really hard for a lot of people to walk away from Nintendo because of the fact
2625300	2632020	they have such gigantic behemoth things for this Super Nintendo classic I'm sure
2632020	2636740	tons of people are streaming gameplay on all 21 of these games right now but this
2636740	2640580	would all you know be a part of that you know and when Nintendo does put out a
2640580	2644060	game like when Mario Odyssey comes out there's gonna be tons of people that
2644060	2647140	want in on that I want to watch people play it and want to stream it and so on
2647140	2650740	and so on I mean no matter what Nintendo's rules on the whole thing
2650740	2656580	might be dark Tetsuya playing a nice line here saying meet the fans in the
2656580	2661820	middle I agree though it could be worse it could be like Atlas and persona 5
2661820	2666980	which I think is still on what somewhat under embargo and he's referencing that
2666980	2670940	whole rules and restrictions that Atlas put out about we're gonna copyright
2670940	2674660	strike you if you broadcast past a certain date in game remember that whole
2674660	2681180	thing so that was a little bit too much over the edge so Tigerclaw pointing out
2681180	2684280	that people are streaming Samus Returns on Twitch and you know what's
2684280	2688380	interesting about that Tigerclaw streaming from the 3ds isn't exactly
2688380	2693700	easy to do I mean as far as I know and correct me if I'm wrong but I think you
2693700	2700140	have to modify a 3ds like you have to pay like a bit of money like hundreds of
2700140	2706260	dollars maybe like 200 $300 to mod your 3ds to put in a capture device to be
2706260	2710420	able to stream from the 3ds because it doesn't have like a built-in HDMI output
2710420	2714580	or anything like that the switch is different it has HDMI output so you can
2714580	2718300	use the same capture card that most people are using for other devices like
2718300	2722660	PlayStation 4 external of the native streaming same thing with Xbox one so
2722660	2729300	and as a live streamer on twitch twitch TV slash Rob Roberts plug plug it's easy
2729300	2732180	to straight if you have a capture card streaming on the switch is fucking easy
2732180	2737540	but I can't do the 3ds yeah and Tiger cloud points out you modify your 3ds or
2737540	2741700	you can buy a 3ds with a capture device installed exactly as its cost it costs a
2741700	2745540	bit more money and the reason why I point that out is that like these fans
2745540	2751420	on Twitch are paying more money to be able to stream Nintendo's games now
2751420	2756300	granted you know some of the more successful ones get their bits and
2756300	2760140	their subscribes and they're you know high viewer counts and their money they
2760140	2763420	get their money back on that investment it's a business investment for some
2763420	2768540	people but for many makes it a tax write-off for many it's not well if you
2768540	2772020	have the paperwork filed to have your own business yeah as your streaming
2772020	2775660	business as a business I would wonder how many of twitches top streamers
2775660	2781740	actually have registered LLCs you'd be surprised you think it was on like one
2781740	2785100	of the you know how to monetize your twitch things I was looking at I guess
2785100	2788660	when you get to a certain point somebody probably approaches you and
2788660	2792460	says have you thought about this for I guess that probably happens to a lot of
2792460	2796740	people I don't know I'll never get there what do I know although it would to be
2796740	2802140	fair vog is an LLC and Bobby really figured a lot of that stuff out that I
2802140	2806260	couldn't figure out but we do have that business end of things but we're not
2806260	2810240	really making money off this venture we just have it so that when we try to
2810240	2813620	approach conventions for sponsorships and things like that people know we're
2813620	2817280	serious that we are a business and that we're not just you individuals so we
2817280	2821420	have it more for the you know being able to have formal paperwork sort of thing
2821420	2826980	formalizing a lot of things and yeah and hopefully in the future maybe some extra
2826980	2831160	stuff yeah and Bobby's pointing out you do have an LLC well yes I know what but
2831160	2836260	that's see Bobby I don't have my own LLC that's a little difference a little
2836260	2840660	difference there all right anyway let's move on more Nintendo fuckery right
2840660	2848900	yeah well the Wii shop channel is going to be shutting down in 2019 January so
2848900	2855500	that is a year and a few months you know coming down the line and that means that
2855500	2861100	all of the virtual console titles that are there to be purchased will be going
2861100	2867980	away right alongside it including you know games like Kirby's
2867980	2875180	avalanche act razor Super Smash Brothers already you know going away and
2875180	2879420	then when it goes you won't be able to buy those games anymore I don't know
2879420	2882340	anything about still being able to play them but you won't be able to buy them
2882340	2888500	anymore and of course there's no virtual console on the switch so I think that
2888500	2892040	that might be where all these minis are coming from you know to corner the
2892040	2901520	market on it so it's it's sad but not unsurprising you know sad yeah it's it's
2901520	2906960	also kind of that whole like shock of here is the digital era that we live in
2906960	2912200	when we buy all this stuff online the reality that someday these stores are
2912200	2915560	gonna close and that's kind of the scary part of this is that you know if you
2915560	2919200	bought all these games online I mean you're not gonna be able to download
2919400	2925680	them again after now granted after 2019 on what will essentially be a 13 year
2925680	2931720	old console at that point but Jamie you as a console collector now I guess the
2931720	2934800	easy answer is you don't buy a lot of stuff online I'm sure you don't because
2934800	2937320	you know you get the cartridges and stuff but there's a lot of stuff you
2937320	2941720	could only buy online you know there's there was you know releases on we shop
2941720	2945680	that were only online for example the after years Final Fantasy for the after
2945680	2949280	years yeah that was only on the we shop and I'm not gonna be able to download
2949280	2955000	that anymore so it's like if I have memory loss on my little cartridge or
2955000	2959040	some type of rot or something like that I don't know or it damages them out it's
2959040	2964760	gone forever yeah that's kind of kind of scary I don't know I mean I guess in the
2964760	2969160	reality you could lose a cartridge the same way but still I don't know it's
2969160	2972760	just I guess sometimes we think like oh we'll be able to access these games
2972760	2976800	whenever we want but that doesn't really end up holding true what do you
2976800	2980240	think it's a collector about that does that kind of like irritate you that
2980240	2983040	there's not gonna be any way to download these games again or is it just one of
2983040	2987800	those well it just is more incentive to get backups on SD cards as fast as
2987800	2995040	possible um I just think it's sad you know it's it's taking away a service I
2995040	2999800	mean for the people who've already paid for it I think they're just like oh well
2999800	3005360	sorry we got your money fuck you some comments in chat over at live dog
3005360	3009480	network comm stop he points out that blaster master sequel was only on the
3009480	3014240	e-store that's true even though blast master zero is better but certainly you
3014240	3018280	know you still the completionist want to visit all the games let's see Bob coffee
3018280	3023080	and chat says after years got released on steam and PSP as part of its Final
3023080	3029040	Fantasy 4 part if it port if I recall correctly I believe force the steam
3029080	3033920	release I can't remember the PSP one but for the steam release that was done in
3033920	3038560	the 3d style the one that was on the Wii was still the sprite based it was like
3038560	3042280	it looked like a fucking ROM hacked Final Fantasy 2 you know what I mean
3042280	3047200	cartridge is what it looked like on the Wii shop so it was kind of different on
3047200	3051880	steam and you know some people want to see one way versus the other you know so
3051880	3056240	Tigerclaw points out excite bike world rally was a game that I bought on the
3056240	3060080	Wii shop I bought some Castlevania game on the Wii shop that was a remake I
3060080	3064120	think of the Gameboy game that they put on the Wii shop at one point and so that
3064120	3068560	will be gone forever here's the other thing to realize too is that some of the
3068560	3074440	games on here they aren't just Nintendo games I mean you've got at the Alex Kidd
3074440	3081320	series you've got a lot of the the Neo Geo games so these are the virtual
3081320	3084720	console games that will no longer be available because they're not on Wii U
3084720	3088360	eShop which is different Wii U eShop is different any of that stuff yeah
3088360	3094280	Castlevania Rondo of blood hmm which good luck finding the PC Engine version
3094280	3098920	y'all unless the switch gets all this well there was the re-release but I mean
3098920	3104400	like the original yeah but I mean a lot of us kind of wonder oh well maybe the
3104400	3108800	switch will come in D the switch will compensate for a lot of this stuff going
3108800	3113400	away but things will have to be re-licensed agreements will have to be
3113400	3116680	remade and maybe they won't be able to get an agreement to put out Rondo of
3116680	3123720	blood again who knows so was I have a feeling because we live in the day and
3123720	3128640	age where Star Fox 2 was dumped to a cartridge before the Super Nintendo
3128640	3132760	Classic was released we live in a day and age where and it this is really
3132760	3136120	probably already out there I just don't go out there and find it but I'm
3136120	3140320	confident it's out there there's probably just a Wii emulator on your PC
3140320	3145680	that you can someday put on a Raspberry Pi maybe you can't now but you will
3145680	3150840	someday and all of these games that were on the eShop one day will have backups
3150840	3154320	available online that are open to be able to play on emulators like I'm I'm
3154320	3158440	confident that sort of technology to at least do it on the PC has got to already
3158440	3163600	be there I just haven't gone looking for it on the dark web or whatever you want
3163600	3169440	to call it so uh guys you doing chat says so where is the Wii shop on the
3169440	3173960	Wii yes we're talking specifically about the Nintendo Wiis built-in shop
3173960	3180840	that will no longer you can't buy or use anything on it after 2019 with early
3180840	3184880	2019 and you're not even gonna be able to add points so you can buy anything
3184880	3191000	new after March of 2018 so you have now from now until March 2018 to get
3191000	3194880	everything you ever wanted off that shop and that's it it closes after that and
3194880	3199000	then it stays up for a basically another year so you can download backups and
3199040	3206080	that's about it so all right um the entire class says I'm sure it will be
3206080	3209720	possible since those games can be transferred to an SD card absolutely now
3209720	3214040	the Wii U the eShop on Wii U that is staying open we don't know I have any
3214040	3217840	word about that at this time but the reason why you keep seeing the Wii U in
3217840	3223800	news stories about this is because every Wii U has a Wii in it you can do the
3223800	3228080	backwards compatibility thing and you launch it in Wii mode and that includes
3228200	3233720	a Wii shop on your Wii U because it's a full Nintendo Wii emulator so that's why
3233720	3237480	you keep seeing that it's shutting down on the Wii U as well because it's the
3237480	3240840	emulator part of it you're gonna be able to use so that's that's why it's all
3240840	3244960	kind of together like that so all right in case you know says I thought the Wii
3244960	3248880	shops been closed already maybe there's many people that can already think that
3248880	3254000	so I mean you know to be fair when was last time you turned on your Nintendo
3254000	3258880	Wii it's been a very very long time yeah I only use it now to play GameCube
3258880	3262840	games because I have the older Wii that can play GameCube games because all my
3262840	3267240	Wii data is on my Wii U I move pretty much that once we got our Wii U yeah
3267240	3271080	moved everything over exactly so I don't really have anything on the Wii with the
3271080	3274700	regular Wii anymore except the fact it's the only way I can play f-zero GX in my
3274700	3278680	house because I don't even have a GameCube right now so but I'll take it all
3278680	3284280	right and dark Tetsuya points out well aren't the Wii U switch and 3ds don't
3284280	3288520	they all connect to the same store the e-shop that's a good point maybe I know
3288520	3292280	because they do call it the e-shop across all the platforms I don't know if
3292280	3297000	3ds shop and switch e-shop and all that stuff are different but maybe we won't
3297000	3301880	see this problem for the Wii U as quick as we think we might but anyway let's
3301880	3305400	move on with some more news so don't spend too much time on things going away
3305400	3311480	in a year and a half steam valve the guys behind steam taken on some fake
3311480	3317960	games that were listed in steam 173 games removed from steam most of them
3317960	3323640	made by a company called silicon echo studio and you can't buy them but if you
3323640	3327340	happen to own one of these games you can still play them however no more trading
3327340	3331520	cards will be available so if you bought it you can play the game but the games
3331560	3336600	themselves are gone and the reason why I guess this whole thing went down is
3336600	3342120	because the same company that owned this silicon echo and zonotron productions
3342120	3347080	they were doing unity asset flips on steam and very cheap bundles outside of
3347080	3351440	steam so all these the money they were basically getting was the trading card
3351440	3356080	stuff so they were just basically you know throwing a bunch of garbage unity
3356080	3359680	stuff together and then having the trading cards spit out and that's where
3359680	3363360	they were essentially making their money was that whole thing and so people
3363360	3366800	that wanted to boost their profile levels and really get into the trading
3366800	3371240	card game and all that stuff that they would buy these really you know junk
3371240	3376600	games to do it that's crazy so yeah cracking down on the
3376600	3380800	proc practices is basically the reason for the policy valve saying that these
3380800	3384160	games were removed from a few different steamworks accounts that were all run by
3384160	3388320	the same person in valves full statements they said yes we have a
3388320	3392040	full-time team monitoring reports then they identified an issue that led to the
3392040	3394920	removal of some titles from a few different steamworks accounts these
3394920	3398000	accounts are generating generating a lot of reports and frustration from
3398000	3401580	customers and other developers it turns out the bad actors were all the same
3401580	3406800	person operating under different accounts so steam trying to clean all
3406800	3413120	the poop out of their store basically and also just a quick follow-up here in
3413120	3418760	our chat over at live dog network calm Rama says the e-shops are web-based so
3418760	3421760	they're shutting down the app and the links that to that specific shop for
3421760	3426120	that console most likely each different e-shop leads to a mobile site that's
3426120	3429640	probably true considering that the switch basically has a web browser in it
3429640	3434920	you just don't have the full power of it unlocked yet yeah and Bobby black wolf
3434920	3439320	pointing out that my we died before I got a Wii U I lost all my saves and
3439320	3443400	never transferred data my fiance has a we because she got a lot of the fitness
3443400	3447880	games she showed me today she was like 20 we fitness games but that's not
3447880	3451080	surprising because that was some of the bread and butter of the we and what they
3451080	3457640	sold a lot of those fitness games to register participation for this week's
3457640	3461800	episode of orange andreide with vog network.com use the passphrase cherry
3461800	3468800	anyhow let us move on dark soccer this has been one that affects several people
3468800	3480160	that we know I mean first-hand that the SAG after a strike is tentatively over
3480160	3486680	the strike's been going on for a year now since last October and they put out
3486680	3491120	a press release saying that the agreement that they have right now will
3491120	3497200	give them additional bonuses based on the number of recording sessions per
3497200	3503200	game with $75 payments for the first session going up to 2100 after 10
3503200	3509320	sessions and that the payment is due no later than the release date of a game
3509320	3516160	which is good because that gives them a significant increase to what they were
3516160	3523800	making per per session and you know we'll also because I mean think about it
3523800	3529880	your voice is your tool in that field and if you are having to change the way
3529880	3539760	you speak or you know you're playing a murder victim in some game yeah you're
3539760	3544200	doing damage to yourself and so yeah it should be compensated and they're also
3544200	3552480	working on providing provisions for health issues like vocal stress and you
3552480	3556640	know how there's a habit of finding people for being late or distracted at a
3556640	3565880	session session and another one that would have required agents support their
3565880	3571760	perform submit their performers for atmospheric voice sessions or face fines
3571760	3576880	and those those sessions are really low-paying anyway so it's a lot of it is
3576880	3582680	they're really working on just again trying to make voice actors as protected
3582680	3587560	as other workers yeah so it's you know it's kind of scary how much we didn't
3587560	3590320	really hear about this like it was really kind of you know when it first
3590320	3594240	happened we were talking a lot about it and then and I say we not to just mean
3594240	3598080	us here olr but I mean just like the the gaming blog world and then it's kind of
3598080	3602600	like it just the issue disappeared for a long time and I don't know if we've
3602600	3605720	really seen the full effects of this yet I mean we have a little bit like for
3605720	3609360	example there's a new voice actor actress in life is strange the prequel
3609360	3612400	right cuz the one from before couldn't come back I don't know if we've seen the
3612400	3617320	full brunt of that yet but you know it's it's I'm happy this finally got
3617320	3623440	resolved because you know who knows what games in 2019 would look like without
3623440	3628080	the voice you know with Jennifer Hale not be able to do them or Nolan North or
3628080	3632680	some of the you know big names that you come to know so it would definitely be
3632680	3641880	sad but I would much rather see voice actors paid their true worth I'd rather
3641880	3646000	see them valued for the amazing work that they do I'm glad they worked it out
3646000	3651480	are working it out it's not complete yet okay but you know like it says it's
3651480	3657200	tentative all right yeah I'm glad they're almost there all right well
3657200	3660760	moving on to one more thing before we get to the classic game or is it system
3660800	3666880	of the week let's get into a story about Atlas and DMCA takedowns and persona 5
3666880	3669840	but it's not what you think it's not the whole YouTube streaming thing we were
3669840	3674080	talking about earlier this is a little bit different this is an emulation group
3674080	3678200	called Nikko tikina I hope I'm saying that or no neko technica I think is that
3678200	3681000	sorry I've totally read that wrong the first time neko technica I think would
3681000	3685720	be their name and these guys actually had a patreon page that they were
3685720	3691520	running for a game for a piece of software called RPC s3 it was a ps3
3691520	3697680	emulator being used to play persona 5 and so they basically were able to get
3697680	3702600	this emulator to work to basically be able to play persona 5 on your PC they
3702600	3707160	actually put up a blog post over atlas to justify why this action was necessary
3707160	3713160	but like if you're gonna go to patreon and ask for money for this type of stuff
3713160	3717000	you got to really watch how you're selling this type of stuff I'm totally
3717000	3721000	like I don't I don't even need the statement from atlas to understand what
3721000	3725360	happened here and it's kind of like the whole thing with the Super Mario 64 and
3725360	3729760	Nintendo going after them like I don't like Nintendo going after these products
3729760	3733920	but when they go to patreon and essentially ask for money and they're
3733920	3737200	kind of bold enough to tie the intellectual property from these
3737200	3743680	companies to the patreon like I'm sorry but what did you think was gonna happen
3743680	3747640	especially with a company like Nintendo or in this case atlas which we know is
3747640	3753000	covered bases that are in a different ballgame yeah that's really the heart of
3753000	3756560	it dar tazuya and chats as a patreon I'm surprised Sony hasn't gone after them in
3756560	3761700	that case huh anyway atlas in their statement said we don't want their
3761700	3765720	players first experiences to be frame rate drops or crashes or other issues
3765720	3769760	that can crop up an emulation that we have not personally overseen we
3769760	3773140	understand that many persona fans would love to see a PC version and while we
3773140	3776680	don't have anything to announce today we are listening for now the best way to
3776680	3781200	experience persona 5 is on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3 and they actually can
3781200	3784520	again they kind of go out of there I think they do more than Nintendo usually
3784520	3788640	does in these cases to say we appreciate the buzz and awareness that the
3788640	3793420	emulation communities to see this but and nowhere in their statement did they
3793420	3799500	say but it's fucking illegal yeah so you know although well I should I should
3799500	3803180	let me let me correct myself before the people jump all over what I just said
3803180	3808980	the practice of the emulation itself the emulator isn't necessarily illegal right
3808980	3813500	but it's when you tie these popular games and you're kind of implying that
3813500	3818300	you know you use these to play these games and and then putting it on your
3818300	3821900	patreon and all that stuff you that's when you get yourself into trouble you
3821900	3826980	have to stick to homebrew stick to homebrew underground PlayStation 3 games
3826980	3830860	homemade you know that weren't ever licensed by Sony in the first place
3830860	3834100	that's the best way to pitch your emulator now I want to see what this
3834100	3838940	emulators like were you able to find it somewhere no well no I I mean I'm just
3838940	3842740	kind of curious about of course I'm still you know trying to get my brain
3842740	3847740	figuring out how to play planet Harriers yeah Bobby Blackwell says at least stick
3847740	3850540	to homebrew on the patreon page I mean the interesting thing about this and to
3850540	3853420	be fair to the emulator team and all this stuff because again I don't want to
3853420	3857780	sound like a complete asshole to what these guys are doing my assumption of
3857780	3862100	this whole thing is that you have to have the persona 3 excuse me persona 3
3862100	3867540	persona 5 disc to put in your computer's blu-ray player to be able to emulate it
3867540	3871300	so you know and that's what atlas is also taking issue with is that because
3871300	3874820	the emulators kind of choppy that actual disc is coming through kind of choppy
3874820	3877460	because it was not meant to be played on your PC it was meant to be played on a
3877460	3882780	PlayStation 3 so it's the emulator people were not really encouraging you
3882780	3889180	to steal games but by putting the games IPs in their emulator it is kind of
3889180	3893100	encouraging people to do something that Alice doesn't want them to do so because
3893100	3896740	I think technically it isn't the end-user license agreement although we
3896740	3902660	all know that's a bit of a gray area and Bobby Blackwell said they actually give
3902660	3905940	instructions on how to dump it on the patreon and that was the part that Atlas
3905940	3908620	was upset about they gave you instructions on how to dump either the
3908620	3911900	blu-ray or the digital download from your PlayStation 3 hard drive well
3911900	3916580	that's that is the giant fucking problem right there period dungeon buster in
3916580	3921040	chat says but if I own the original copy of the game my ps3 dies and I still want
3921040	3925380	to play it I'm just screwed no get yourself an emulator dungeon buster just
3925380	3929060	get yourself an emulator that doesn't put a patreon page up saying how to dump
3929060	3932700	commercial games and putting pictures of those commercial games over it does that
3932700	3940620	make sense so all right let's move on to the classic game of the week that
3940620	3945380	with those first emulators that came out for those classic games although this
3945380	3950420	week we have a twist because once a month dark soccer likes to dump into the
3950420	3956300	gaming dump jump into the gaming vault take a big no I she she dumps all her
3956300	3961020	games out off the shelf anyway that's the cat once a month she likes to find a
3961020	3964740	system that she thinks is worthy of your attention and a little mini
3964740	3969540	programming note tonight this is actually September's console of the
3969540	3973420	month because reasons dark soccer was gonna do it last week but she was out
3973420	3977660	last week so we no longer it was not able to do this so this is this is one
3977660	3984460	day late this is a tardy and do classic game but I had the flu so this is a
3984460	3988100	tardy entry for September's classic system of the month yeah yeah all right
3988100	3992620	here it is what is the classic system of the month the Panasonic Q also
3992620	3998620	sometimes known as just Q and game Q and of course you put Animal Crossing as the
3998620	4005260	music here oh shit of course you did yeah so this is basically the game turn
4005260	4009780	it up a bit you picked the GameCube tonight I think the GameCube but you're
4009780	4015420	you're making a hipster by picking the hipster GameCube is what you did it was
4015420	4019340	cool I wouldn't mind having one actually it actually is cool but I'll
4019340	4023860	let you talk about it and it's a hybrid GameCube and DVD player that was
4023860	4030580	manufactured by Panasonic be it only came out in Japan and it was meant to do
4030580	4035980	what the Xbox and PlayStation 2 were doing which as in have a commercial DVD
4035980	4043660	you know playback function instead of just using the Nintendo optical discs
4043660	4053580	the Q was actually licensed by Nintendo to Panasonic as Panasonic made actually
4053580	4059940	it wasn't necessarily a Panasonic it was a result of a deal that was a broker
4059940	4068220	between much yeah I miss said that much cheetah who owned Panasonic and Nintendo
4068260	4074420	and so when Nintendo said that they could produce the optical disc drives
4074420	4081500	that they had an agreement allowing Matsuda to produce a DVD system with the
4081500	4090220	ability to play GameCube games so it went into production on December 13 well
4090220	4095100	it was released on September sorry December 13 2001 for roughly four
4095100	4101460	hundred and thirty nine dollars u.s. and ceased production on December 18 2003
4101460	4110860	because not a lot of people bought it so it has a backlit LCD screen a front
4110860	4114580	loading slot trade that actually had a lot of problems with it because of the
4114580	4122620	rubber band in the motor would get brittle and snap but it had sound output
4122620	4130340	in Dolby Digital 5.1 or DTS a separate subwoofer with a subwoofer boost and a
4130340	4136500	really nice stainless steel chassis it came with gray controllers that had the
4136500	4141820	Panasonic brand on it the thing is cool is that when you plug them in the little
4141820	4147620	lights around the controller ports light up blue so it says blue on you know this
4147620	4155700	polished steel finish and it was really neat but because of the legs it had on
4155700	4161260	the bottom it actually had a special Panasonic Q Game Boy player that was
4161260	4166220	designed specifically for it whereas the GameCube had you know its own version
4166220	4173860	but yeah there was actually the buttons that are on the front of it it has one
4173860	4178540	of the ones that I thought was neat is it has a surround sound virtualizer to
4178540	4184100	it which you know it just boosts the channel output does sound like surround
4184100	4189100	sound you know it's got your typical DVD buttons on it's got memory card ports on
4189100	4196300	the side but I do like that it has like a bass boost another neat thing that it
4196300	4201820	does now I've watched videos of DVD playback on it there's like a cinema
4201820	4206380	mode that changes the illumination on the screen you know how it displays the
4206380	4211780	video but there's also a dialogue booster which makes of course dialogues
4211780	4216700	or whatever channel the dialogue might be in stand out from the background
4216700	4220620	noise no surprise that Panasonic would have all these sound altering things
4220620	4223660	right because that's kind of you know something they're known for that's one
4223660	4226740	thing that I thought was really neat about it especially I was thinking about
4226740	4230740	people who like a problem that I have sometimes is that if there's too much
4230740	4236420	sound or like for example you have two people talking the voice all turns to
4236420	4240380	mush for me you just like like the teachers in you know Charlie Brown
4240380	4249380	specials and something like that would be wonderful to have but and on top of
4249380	4255740	that too just it's a sharp looking little system it's you know it's got
4255740	4261940	that steel body with the the clear cover around it it has that shiny front
4261940	4268020	finish and on the back too I mean the thing has got some very interesting
4268020	4278340	hookups on it hold on we have optical out we have a standard composite s video
4278340	4287300	digital AV out it really is just for its time it's really really something
4287300	4291980	else and so I you know I don't think it got a lot of appreciation you know
4291980	4295620	people either already had their DVD players at the time but then again I
4295620	4300260	know people who picked up ps2s to have a DVD player the other thing too is it
4300260	4304380	actually does have video CD capability in it too if people still have those
4304380	4310180	things so there you go all right there it is on the queue the
4310180	4313660	classic console of the month Panasonic cute the GameCube she picked the
4313660	4318980	GameCube everybody no I picked the GameCube I I actually you know the queue
4318980	4322860	is absolutely as much crap as I'm giving Jamie this is absolutely a recognizable
4322860	4326660	thing because of the fact it was like it was like this existing console that kind
4326660	4330500	of had a fresh coat of paint that was very unique that of course we didn't get
4330500	4333420	in the u.s. well and it's not the first time something like that has happened
4333460	4337620	because remember we had the sharp twin Famicom kind of the last one I can
4337620	4346320	think of yeah I think since then because there was the the Sega one that had the
4346320	4350700	Sega CD playable yeah that would have been before GameCube was that that
4350700	4357300	wasn't also Panasonic was it no remember and then sharp had the Famicom TV in
4357300	4363180	Japan the closest thing I can think of is how the PlayStation TV thing is built
4363180	4368220	into certain Sam is the Samsung TVs that have it so there that's the closest
4368220	4376060	thing I can think of yeah the JVC x I ah was the one there it is and Rama said
4376060	4381620	that he had a sharp TV ness but you know also Nintendo's licensed out you know to
4381620	4385900	sharp for the twin Famicom you know the one that had the the built-in right
4385900	4390620	business yeah I'm the built-in business I don't know what I'm saying lots of pun
4390620	4395660	sorry I was just to say lots of puns about Q in chat rage nator in chat
4395660	4400100	saying Q is a good antagonist in Star Trek the next generation as well and
4400100	4403220	then that led to a bunch of Star Trek jokes there Bobby Blackwell says I would
4403220	4407100	have bought a Q if it had come to the US vid power talking about they also made a
4407100	4411220	Panasonic branded GameCube controller to go with the Q it was all from our chat
4411220	4415540	room at live dog network calm I was actually thinking of Q from the Bond
4415540	4421660	movies oh there you go all right well we are gonna take a break but we will be

4459140	4462580	for being here over in our chat room at live dog vog network calm those of you
4462580	4465860	listening on the podcast feed whenever you want throughout the week appreciate
4465860	4468780	that too hope you guys are having a good week whatever it is you're doing can't
4468780	4471980	believe it's already October any Halloween plans I guess we have to start
4471980	4479580	planning for that um no I don't know do do late late late 30s and 40 something's
4479580	4483580	do things for Halloween anymore I might be doing like a charity thing oh that's
4483580	4487900	great okay that's that's a good use of time good like I don't know yeah well
4487900	4492060	maybe somebody that needs to have a charity event put on for them is Yoshi
4492060	4495460	because apparently I don't know if you heard about it this week but there was a
4495460	4498740	little bit of a thing going around the internet on some of the Twitter's and
4498740	4505380	things like that that basically Mario is in fact in Super Super Mario world
4505380	4508620	when you see Yoshi stick out his tongue you see Mario do a little thing that
4508620	4512060	looks like this and that Mario enough for those obviously on the radio I'm
4512060	4514900	kind of moving my fist down slowly but I think many of you know where I'm gonna
4514900	4517660	go with this if you are reading something internet and it kind of always
4517660	4523340	looks like Mario's going like go but it turns out according to a recent
4523340	4528420	interview on Nintendo's official site the developers the Takashi Seizuka and
4528420	4535300	Shigefumi Hino talked about the creation of this game and says that they talked
4535300	4538260	about this where they want Mario to ride something and so forth like kind of like
4538260	4541100	a horse that was kind of like a crocodile and so forth and then said in
4541100	4543580	the interview lots of people think that when Mario is pointing his finger
4543580	4547740	forward he's saying go and Yoshi's tongue comes out however the setup I
4547740	4553860	drew was that when Mario punches Yoshi in the head the characters tongue shoots
4553860	4559180	out in surprise what's more there's an added bop sound however it seemed like
4559180	4564500	people would say poor Yoshi so that's why it became that Mario is saying go so
4564500	4569380	the original artwork for that is Mario hitting Yoshi on the back of the head
4569380	4574580	that poor poor poor thing and that's why I think so many people are fans of Yoshi
4574580	4580340	because he had to put up with Mario shit for so long so stop be in chat over at
4580340	4584980	live.vognetware.com says hey Yoshi ain't no saint in the Japanese version he
4584980	4590580	eats dolphins that's true there are those dolphin monsters or whatever you
4590580	4594140	want to call them that Yoshi can eat that's true so dark soccer does this
4594140	4596940	change your world to know that all this time you've been punching Yoshi in the
4596940	4602060	back of the head I've been rocked well well I guess in a way I'm shook Rob you
4602060	4608060	get are you shooketh I am shooketh huh I shook it's I guess if you think about
4608140	4610980	when you kind of ride horses you kind of kick them a little bit like you know
4610980	4613540	there's a way there's a way to it I mean you're not just like unless you're an
4613540	4617060	asshole who wears spurs yeah yeah yeah I mean there's a there's a way to it but
4617060	4622420	you you know but still it just it kind of looks like a donkey punch but I guess
4622420	4626740	never mind I'm not gonna go there you can fill in the blanks let's get to some
4626740	4630300	rapid-fire news and cover some other news going on in the gaming industry a
4630300	4635140	little faster here talking about doom on the Nintendo switch and people wondering
4635140	4638300	if because oh well if dooms gonna be on the switch does this mean motion
4638300	4642220	controls coming to the game and the answer is no it will not be like
4642220	4645460	Splatoon where there's motion control aiming there's just gonna be the
4645460	4650020	traditional analog controls the game will not have Splatoon like controls so
4650020	4652840	this really is just a straight-up port it doesn't sound like they're doing a
4652840	4656300	lot of enhancements for the switch at least not that we know of who knows you
4656300	4659700	know Bethesda may surprise us with like a bonus level or something I always said
4659700	4664260	putting like maybe not so much now I think about it maybe not Samus I don't
4664300	4671420	think Samus would work so well in a game like doom but Ridley would so maybe
4671420	4674820	something else from the Metroid universe would show up in the game anyway
4674820	4678420	something else that many people are playing on the Nintendo switch is Sonic
4678420	4682060	Mania granted it's on a bunch of other systems as well but specifically with a
4682060	4686380	Nintendo version there is a home button issue when suspending the game so the
4686380	4691020	good news is that whole feature whatever not feature of a bug is actually being
4691020	4696260	addressed a patch is gonna be rolling out soon they haven't said when but soon
4696260	4699540	I think it might be out by now because that was a tweet on September 25th so

5114480	5120320	I don't know how so anyway let's move on with some more news we're gonna start
5120320	5124480	off talking about the Atari box that's right more information was announced on
5124480	5127640	the Atari box this week and I don't know about you dark Sakura I'm not
5127640	5131960	feeling this the Atari box is going to be running Linux it'll be out which is
5131960	5135120	fine that's not that's not the part about me it's gonna be on an AMD chip
5135120	5140320	it's gonna cost two hundred and fifty dollars yeah so the Atari box will be
5140320	5144400	running on Linux with an AMD processor it'll be between 250 to 300 dollars
5144400	5148120	Atari box creator and general manager I'm gonna totally mispronounce his name
5148120	5153120	and I apologize fair gal Mac said that the Atari is going to be doing a
5153120	5158040	crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo to launch the Atari box in the spring of
5158040	5163860	2018 the Atari box is gonna launch with a back catalog of classic games so the
5163860	5168080	box will make people hopefully you know want to play stuff that in past as you
5168080	5171040	know the Super Nintendo classic and stuff is done well with this but also
5171040	5176480	going to run independent games like minecraft air char and Terraria and the
5176480	5180680	things that people want to do today you will also be able to do streaming run
5180680	5185240	apps around the rows the web play music because this is basically a PC or a
5185240	5190640	Raspberry Pi a little stronger though but in an Atari box feedback from fans
5190640	5196240	on things like content colors and so forth will come into play on this so you
5196240	5200880	can look forward to that if you want to fund this on Indiegogo here's my problem
5200880	5204680	with this whole thing is that as much as they want to do the whole classic
5204680	5209600	nostalgia thing you guys know those flashback consoles that are out there's
5209640	5214120	already an Atari flashback console that I think is 60 or $70 I think there's
5214120	5217040	several models they're up to I don't know if you know this Jamie have you
5217040	5221160	seen those Atari flashback things before yeah I think I have one like in a drawer
5221160	5224640	somewhere they're fine they get the job done they're basically like the NES
5224640	5228480	classics basically but for you know sorry they're up to eight so this year
5228480	5232520	is the Atari flashback 8 do you know how many Atari cartridges we have laying
5232520	5236160	around Oh God well there were so many games right so that's why the whole
5236560	5241520	thing lived for like ever yeah no what's hardy Atari party next year by the way
5241520	5247360	oh really yeah it's tragic that is sad I'm sad but anyway in my heart you can
5247360	5251080	have an Atari party where it whenever you want if you have well if you have
5251080	5254760	all the real stuff or a flashback 8 is what they're up to now the new thing
5254760	5259640	they added this year Activision finally let them put things like kaboom and
5259640	5263320	pitfall I think is in there and hero and some of the Activision games which
5263320	5266960	really were like some of the biggest titles on the 2600 were old-school
5266960	5271040	Activision and yes that same Activision that's around today that owns Blizzard I
5271040	5275520	mean they got their start really in the 2600 era do you remember why Activision
5275520	5279000	got so popular and why so many people went to go make games for Activision
5279000	5283320	because it was a bunch of Atari people that left yeah because Activision would
5283320	5286880	properly credit their developers yeah there's that because when pitfall was
5286880	5293080	made it was David Crane's pitfall remember also oh crap what was it no it
5293080	5298800	was EA that used to do the album artwork oh and have the pictures of the
5298800	5302000	developers inside like they were abandoned everything that was cool yeah
5302000	5307880	so I guess no wonder they're in the same bed now yeah maybe act F points out
5307880	5310560	there's also a gold version of the flashback yeah that's the one drawback
5310560	5314560	is that there's like there's a flashback 8 there's a flashback 8 Activision
5314560	5317720	Edition there's a flashback 8 gold edition and like all of them have like
5317720	5320480	slightly different games on them and I don't know if it's like a gotta collect
5320480	5324760	them all type of thing but that part's kind of annoying just have one with all
5324760	5329760	the fucking games on it cuz we know that like you can fit every Atari 2600 game
5329760	5337200	like ever made on like one of those older floppy disks from the 1990s like
5337200	5341800	seriously Atari games are not that big they were what 4 kilobytes 8 kilobytes
5341800	5345800	yeah maybe the biggest ones ever were like 32 kilobytes and that's pushing it
5345800	5349240	I don't even know if they ever got that big I don't think so so you take
5349280	5353160	hundreds of those and you can you're not even gonna hardly fill up an old disk
5353160	5357240	like that actually I'd like to point this out to kind of as a side note that's
5357240	5365200	a side note right for people who want to see have an idea of what old arcade
5365200	5371040	games look like the Atari arcade games there is a special I saw on it was
5371040	5374920	YouTube or something maybe maybe Netflix but it was about Steve Jobs when he
5374920	5379160	worked for Atari oh yeah cuz breakout was a Steve Jobs thing right I think
5379160	5384000	him and was all right that's where they kind of met yeah but well they had
5384000	5388400	already met before that but it was like the band's first album let's say that
5388400	5392280	but the thing is that they talk about how many chips and how much money each
5392280	5397160	chip took to make an arcade game and then later on you have then when you
5397160	5401000	talk to the developers of some of the home versions of these games and taking
5401000	5405160	you know the arcade game and trying to reprogram and compress it into such a
5405160	5409080	smaller package I mean no wonder pac-man was kind of crap oh yeah it's
5409080	5413240	the whole reason why pac-man was crap the developer of pac-man wanted a larger
5413240	5417080	cartridge for that game and Atari said no and that's why pac-man could only
5417080	5425480	draw one goes to frame why I was sweaty balls anyway so anyway here's the thing
5425480	5428220	with you try boss I don't want to be a hater I want to see Atari succeed
5428220	5432600	believe it or not I'm rooting for you but Atari has to figure out what's its
5432600	5438920	niche because the problem is I can fucking play Minecraft and Terraria on
5438920	5444960	fucking Xbox 360 at this point which is gonna be way cheaper than $250 fucking a
5444960	5450800	Xbox one s aren't those down to like 200 bucks at this point same thing with
5450800	5456160	PlayStation 4's like the entry models those are getting cheap like and if
5456160	5461040	those are gonna be cheaper than an Atari box Atari needs to find its niche and
5461040	5466000	the classic game archive on Atari somebody else with the license beat you
5466000	5471640	to it guys so you got to figure out how to strengthen that now how about just
5471640	5477420	throwing it out there if you really want to milk the moustache nostalgia figure
5477420	5480280	out something different you can do with those classic classic games that the
5480280	5485520	flashback console can't do you can have a pure emulation mode fine but what
5485520	5492160	about something like here I go you ready Xbox 360 game room where you had
5492160	5498000	the leaderboards the videos you could play online with somebody else now
5498000	5501720	you're milking that classic arcade library with something a little extra
5501720	5506040	that doesn't exist on the flashback console that might appeal to some people
5506040	5510480	you know that's a start but again that price is still pretty high I think you
5510480	5513560	know Atari box is really gonna have to figure out like what's its niche what
5513560	5517520	can what's it really gonna be able to do they can't already be done by a
5517520	5520680	device that many people already have in their living room that would be the
5520680	5525760	audience for this sort of thing that's sort of my my take on that oh and dark
5525760	5530480	Tetsuya points out I even forgot about this those PlayStation 4 and Xbox one
5530480	5534240	collections there's already two volumes of those you're right there's already
5534240	5539080	Atari collections on PlayStation 4 and Xbox one so you can even play old Atari
5539080	5546680	games already on Xbox one so Atari box figure out how you're better than Xbox
5546680	5553440	one okay Rama points out Xbox one s is between 249 and 299 okay fair same price
5553440	5559000	as what Atari box is looking at so how are you gonna be better than Xbox Atari
5559000	5563000	or what are you gonna give that Xbox can't that's the only way this sorry
5563000	5568280	Atari your heyday is over is the only way it's gonna work yep good luck I hope
5568600	5573200	you can figure it out all right let's move on with something else dark soccer
5573200	5579080	well this is the ultimate of splat fest in the first one I actually give a shit
5579080	5586040	about kind of literally Nintendo of Europe has announced the next date in
5586040	5591480	time for their next splat fest in Splatoon 2 it's the first full week of
5591480	5598240	October and it asks a question that is relevant to my interests which way
5598240	5603000	should your toilet paper go over or under it goes under its team front roll
5603000	5610240	if it's under its back roll back roll I know right I was thinking I'm sorry my
5610240	5614040	favorite thing this is this was my proud Twitter moment I have a lot of Twitter
5614040	5617600	moments where I'm like shaking my head this is the worst dumpster fire of an
5617640	5622440	internet website but a rare proud Twitter moment came on the announcement
5622440	5626440	post for this that Nintendo made on Twitter there were so many replies with
5626440	5632000	the Alyssa Edwards gif going back rolls and I was like Twitter I'm proud of you
5632000	5636840	in this particular moment so there you go so anyway it starts off on October
5636840	5644800	7th and it will run for a full 24 hours but of course we know that the right way
5644800	5651440	to do it is front roll this is one of those things where I just I don't care
5651440	5656360	and not like I understand this is a very controversial thing I just I feel like I
5656360	5660640	don't have a horse in this race that's this what it is like I'm not I don't
5660640	5664960	care if the paper is front or back I really don't I really don't I just care
5664960	5672040	if it's three-ply but if you do it the wrong way you're wrong you're wrong and
5672040	5676800	you should feel sad have they said if they're doing this in America yet I'm
5676800	5679920	trying to see if no I haven't seen anything about the u.s. yeah I'm looking
5679920	5683760	I'm looking at the wiki and I don't see it but I don't see the Europe one listed
5683760	5686880	there either so I'm wondering if one of our Splatoon fans in chat over at
5686880	5691280	live.vognetwork.com knows the answer come on no Gus and chat says leave it to
5691280	5697240	Europe to tackle the real issues guys you don't chat says do you ever look at
5697240	5702240	an adding machine the paper is back roll yeah but if you look at the patent
5702240	5709520	for toilet paper it goes over oh god here we go let's see act it's also gif
5709520	5714640	act theft and chat points out Japan's new Splatfest is stamina versus power
5714640	5719520	that one's interesting but it's not like the types of things that divorces are
5719520	5725120	made on like this Splatfest it's no you know what my divorce would be huh
5725160	5734000	god damn it close the lid I'm taking the cat and moving to Japan bye no really
5734000	5738040	and marrying Margaret Cho no I'm done with that oh you don't mention her
5738040	5741500	anymore that fantasy is over I apologize I'm not interested in her anymore okay
5741500	5748040	you moved on I am interested in just living my moe moe dream in a little
5748040	5752560	farmhouse okay in Japan work close enough to a train station that I can go
5752560	5758040	to cool places let's see an act up just confirming that America has not gotten a
5758040	5761640	new Splat that Splat fest yet so we don't have the official announcement
5761640	5766440	however it is worth pointing out the first three for America in Europe were
5766440	5771000	all the same so if this does change it would be the first one that is different
5771000	5778800	so we'll see what happens there all right there it is the world's most
5778800	5782320	controversial Splat fest it's gonna get ugly I don't know what team to pick
5782600	5786400	you know I just I don't care enough so I just I guess I'm gonna figure out what
5786400	5791880	my friends pick and go with that so all right let's move on to another story
5791880	5799000	what what don't be Alyssa no back rolls but I like Alyssa Edwards I like Alyssa
5799000	5802440	but no back rolls all right I'm gonna ask a drag queen what I should do all
5802440	5806880	right I can arrange that right now you know one thing I think we can all agree
5806880	5811880	you shouldn't do is buy Marvel vs. Capcom infinite ball I'm sorry I'm sorry
5811920	5815720	it was a really low blow I'm sorry horrible transition well the bar isn't
5815720	5820360	that high but here look here's the reality guys and I apologize to the MVC
5820360	5825040	I fans out there but your games your game struggling a little bit that's the
5825040	5830600	reality of the situation and that's here it is the sales charts are happening the
5830600	5834640	Japanese charts came out this week some media create reported the numbers
5834640	5839560	Marvel vs. Capcom infinite charted at number eight on PlayStation 4 with
5839600	5845760	8,273 copies sold keep in mind the Xbox one is a non factor in Japan we don't
5845760	5850400	even know how many it sold there but it wasn't many here's the thing so 8,000
5850400	5855520	copies sold 8,000 and change Pokken tournament DX with the number one spot
5855520	5859600	fifty three thousand three hundred ninety three copies that is a re-release
5859600	5864760	of a Wii U game essentially now to be fair not everybody had the Wii U this is
5864760	5869600	part of the reason why it's being re-released but still that is over what
5869600	5873720	five I'm trying to do math fast five six times as many copies of Pokken
5873720	5879400	tournament sold the Marvel vs. Capcom infinite in Japan also worth noting
5879400	5890080	super Street Fighter 2 turbo HD remix for the switch 16,404 copies Street
5890080	5895640	Fighter 2 outsold Marvel vs. Capcom infinite in Japan this week Street
5895640	5904880	Fighter 2 what do you think of that Jamie I have nothing to say by the way
5904880	5910960	in the UK kind of a similar story just so you know it's all poop it's it's not
5910960	5916480	looking good there in the UK either it was mentioned in a tweet that ultra
5916480	5919840	Street Fighter 2 for Nintendo switch had a better opening weekend than
5919840	5923920	Marvel vs. Capcom infinite although I don't have the numbers over there as
5923920	5929880	well so there it is act-def in chat over at live.vognetwork.com also points out
5929880	5934680	Pokken tournament on the Wii U sold more than Street Fighter 5 on release so I'm
5934680	5938560	not surprised that is true that was kind of a quote-unquote shock I guess you
5938560	5942600	could say at that time although you know those that have played Pokken tournament
5942600	5945680	I know many I know many folks that are really really into that such as act-def
5945680	5950120	I have a copy and haven't played it yet it's it's good I have it on Wii U I'm a
5950120	5955120	little hesitant to buy it again on switch I don't really I don't think I
5955120	5959240	played it enough to justify the repurchase but I think if you didn't
5959240	5962740	get it on Wii U and you like fighting games at all and you know especially
5962740	5966080	Tekken which you know obviously this has a lot of Pokken it has a lot in common
5966080	5969920	with it I think it's worth a look I do I I would recommend it on that basis but I
5969920	5973000	don't know if I would want to rebuy it myself I'm just not that into it to do
5973000	5978840	that but there you go so anyway sorry to you Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite fans
5978840	5983360	but I don't know I don't know Capcom kind of dug themselves a hole with this
5983360	5986520	one and I don't know if it's the fact that the x-men aren't in it or just the
5986520	5989800	art style at first was just sending a bad message when this game was first
5989800	5995980	revealed or they just made a bad game but this is not bode well for Capcom and
5995980	6002240	fighting games when they're their game from 1990 yes an updated remix and all
6002280	6007080	that stuff yes yes but still a game from that long ago is doing better I don't
6007080	6011000	know what that says anyway speaking of games from long ago Dark
6011000	6021000	Sakura hmm data East need I say more data East gave us bad dudes karate champ
6021000	6032060	kung fu master and burger time burger time yes yes well um there is a company
6032100	6041780	called G mode that is working on a data East revival project so on their page
6041780	6046620	that says are you looking for a data East license here's the answer G mode
6046620	6054140	owns over 100 titles of deco data East franchises which includes let me just
6054140	6057940	pick the ones that don't you know especially suck well I played fighters
6057940	6062060	history a bit I kind of like that Joe and Mac lock and chase midnight
6062060	6067900	resistance midnight resistance is a fucking good game Dark Lord burn and
6067900	6075740	rubber bloody wolf bad dudes versus dragon ninja crude buster also known as
6075740	6085020	two crude dudes so yeah they're working on trying to re-release some of the
6085020	6090020	games and basically you can reach out to them on their webpage so that they
6090020	6096780	can find a partner to get the games out so yay fighters history I still remember
6096780	6099980	I care more about midnight resistance to be honest I still remember not that long
6099980	6103820	ago there was like a burger time reimagining game that came out and it
6103820	6106780	kind of came and went and I want to say it even got delisted at one point
6106780	6110500	because I think the idea was they probably lost the license and maybe
6110500	6113260	this kind of answers where it went is back in the pool for someone else to
6113260	6119900	snatch up so someone snatched yes so maybe you know I don't know maybe some
6119900	6123460	like really hardcore developer can pick up burger time and do like a burger time
6123460	6129620	ultimate type of game we're like you murder those fucking eggs and bacon the
6129620	6136420	chase you around the board be like zombie burger exactly all right from the
6136420	6143180	developers of Bayonetta bring you burger time three all right I think this
6143180	6147660	is really cool actually I I think this is this actually makes the Assassin's
6147660	6151460	Creed series which is not something that I really ever super get into it's just
6151460	6155220	you know again I don't have time obsessed though this I think this is
6155220	6158580	great though is that what they're doing is that in the latest Assassin's Creed
6158580	6163460	game Assassin's Creed origin a free origins update in 2018 is going to let
6163460	6168020	you turn off combat story and challenges for an educational mode
6168020	6173060	called discovery tour and it's because of the you know high-level graphics
6173060	6176740	engine that these games provide this is gonna allow you to way to actually kind
6176740	6181340	of explore ancient Egypt in an educational sort of sense and if you're
6181340	6184940	kind of rolling your eyes at educational games well then don't fucking play it
6184940	6188140	there's Assassin's Creed origin for you to play but I think this is kind of a
6188140	6193240	really neat enhancement to an existing game to use the engine for something you
6193240	6196640	know like if you like this game so much why don't you learn a little something
6196640	6202440	about it well to point out and I mentioned this before when I was taking
6202440	6206440	a little it was a few years ago when I was taking art history that my teacher
6206440	6212760	used scenes from Assassin's Creed 2 no to illustrate Italy during the
6212760	6217720	Renaissance because I mean some of the you know the the buildings around you
6217720	6222080	know are of course severely damaged and things have been rebuilt and everything
6222080	6226560	but it she said that you know from maps and pictures that was a fairly good
6226560	6232720	likeness yeah of you know Italy around that time of Rome you know and so we had
6232720	6238280	slides from Assassin's Creed 2 in our history that's cool and then we talked
6238280	6243040	about how the de-medicis hated each other well anyway discovery mode is
6243040	6246440	gonna be out in early 2018 it will not be there when the game releases on
6246440	6250720	October 27th but you do have this to look forward to again in this mode
6250720	6254080	you're gonna be able to explore ancient Egypt there will be no enemies running
6254080	6259440	around they will also add a series of guided tours curated historians and
6259440	6262400	Egyptologists will be available I guess in the game maybe they're getting some
6262400	6265520	people to do some voicing and some writing for this stuff you can learn
6265520	6269800	directly about pyramids Cleopatra mummification and more you can learn all
6269800	6273880	about all the those big things that go with I would play that I think that's neat I
6273880	6277320	think it's just kind of neat I would totally be down yeah so very cool
6277720	6282040	props to the developers for doing that vidpower in chat says age of empires 2
6282040	6286680	is my favorite education game you know I learned stuff from civilization you know
6286680	6289680	as much as you might kind of laugh at that you know when you build wonders of
6289680	6293640	the world you might learn you know they get do a little narration about why they
6293640	6296600	built it and you know what it was for and all that stuff so you kind of learn
6296600	6301200	you know I thought it was kind of cool all right just a few more stories for
6301200	6306320	you guys dark Sakura one more story from you yeah well you know we've hit the
6306320	6315320	30th anniversary for a Mega Man or Rockman and there was a phrase that was
6315320	6320160	said by the producer of the Mega Man Legacy Collection to Kazuhiro Tsuchiya
6320160	6325360	and as it was said I'm just gonna read the quote because it's very interesting
6325360	6331640	I want to say the Capcom has not forgotten about Rockman the logo here is
6331640	6336080	being put to good use that was the 30th anniversary logo Rockman's 30th

6417880	6422680	windows executable all right one more story for you guys before we open up the
6422680	6427080	skype line at orange lounge radio all one word and yes I saved the best for
6427080	6430640	last tonight at least from my perspective very excited to hear about
6430640	6436480	this there is going to be a Commodore 64 mini as if the NES classic and the Super
6436480	6440240	NES classic wasn't enough now Jamie this one this one would be worth getting
6440240	6444000	because most Commodore 64 is don't even fucking work anymore like it's very hard
6444000	6448160	to find one that actually works so I love this that they're actually doing
6448160	6452320	this so they're actually going to be putting out a Commodore 64 mini it's
6452320	6456960	going to be a fully licensed recreation of the 80s they call it console but it
6456960	6461720	was kind of a computer it will connect via HDMI it will have a joystick even
6461720	6464640	though there was no official joystick for Commodore 64 there were a few
6464640	6470760	popular ones that I think this is based off of and there will be of course 64
6470880	6476240	licensed games haha the console will be half the size of the original those
6476240	6480080	things are huge some of the games to look forward to California games
6480080	6487120	impossible mission another visitor stay a while stay forever
6487120	6490520	you ever play that game with the bad synth in the beginning no I didn't but
6490520	6495800	what was that school game that terrible school game or was it on Amiga the
6495800	6499400	school game I don't know there's a lot of like educational game or like out of
6499480	6503920	school you were in a school maybe it was on Amiga and maybe maybe I really like
6503920	6508720	this art of art game where was I speedball to brutal deluxe paragroid you
6508720	6513680	can look at more information over at VC 64.com slash games you can actually look
6513680	6518240	at all the games in it including and this is kind of funny chips challenges
6518240	6521840	in this I know the guy that made this game actually so I kind of want to bring
6521840	6524540	he lives here locally so I kind of want to bring him on OLR to talk about this
6524540	6528920	maybe I I want to know if he even knows this is being made he may or may not I
6528960	6533760	don't know impossible mission 2 is gonna be in there as well which is the less
6533760	6537640	noteworthy sequel Monty on the run that was a huge game if you were kind of into
6537640	6541720	games back then anyway there's some good picks in here I'm cyber annoyed those
6541720	6545400	games were really big on Commodore 64 you know last ninjas missing and some
6545400	6549820	other stuff but you know I think there were only so many licenses they could
6549820	6554960	get they couldn't get things like Donkey Kong's c64 port and things like that but
6554960	6558120	this is this is to be a pretty good selection I'm very interested to look
6558120	6565760	for to see it here so anyway I'm looking in chat over at live dot vog network
6565760	6569360	calm black wolf actually has an answer for you school days maybe and that's it
6569360	6572840	you said yes school days that was it because I remember the classrooms were
6572840	6577080	yellow Wow Wow good job Bobby all right it was for the spectrum that's what I
6577080	6581920	was thinking of other things that are available on this mini classic Commodore
6581920	6587720	64 pics pixel filter options save game functions and the ability to use a USB
6587880	6593000	keyboard no word though if it has the full Commodore 64 shell in it like where
6593000	6596240	you could launch into basic and maybe program your own thing I don't know if
6596240	6599680	it's gonna go that far but that would be really rad if it did I'm sure somebody
6599680	6604800	would hack it to do that it will be out in early 2018 and it will go for sixty
6604800	6611120	nine ninety nine euros because it's not coming out in the states it's coming out
6611120	6617300	overseas of course not yeah so there it is it's not gonna be coming out here
6617300	6620940	it's coming out overseas I hope they will find a way to release it here I
6620940	6625460	understand that Commodore 64 was huge overseas especially you know in the UK
6625460	6629020	and stuff but I have a big place in my heart for it here so I really hope they
6629020	6632660	find a way to put it out here it's being developed by retro games not the same
6632660	6638180	company as retro computers who are making the Sinclair Vega Plus retro
6638180	6644620	games did the 64 and they're working with kosh media who owns deep silver to
6644620	6648740	distribute the console so that's pretty exciting yeah I agree Tiger Khan chat
6648740	6652780	says you could import it it'll cost more yeah I probably could I mean hopefully
6652780	6657240	these things won't have the scarcity problems that consoles over here have
6657240	6660900	had with Nintendo stuff and I can just ask one of my friends over there to go
6660900	6663700	into a shop and get me one like you know send them money or whatever and then
6663700	6668580	just have it sent that way maybe one of my pals from girls gone Wow or geek card
6668580	6672140	or something like that one of our vlog shows in the UK maybe somebody your pal
6672140	6678620	pals my pal pals yes my pal pals I get it power yeah you're funny all right if

6806920	6815360	but my intent is to slowly wiener into gaming so if she wants rage there don't

6924120	6929960	honestly well backtrack a little bit I assume you already know about the
6929960	6934120	medical emergency I am like a week and a half ago I think I picked up on that but
6934120	6938000	I didn't want to disclose that myself on the show that's your business well well
6938040	6942480	feel free you probably can do it a little bit more successfully than I can
6942480	6946800	so I my understanding is you went to the hospital over some heart issues to put
6946800	6956360	it briefly right correctly yeah yeah but anyway yeah it's basically served as a
6956360	6964160	wake-up call for me yeah as a result I you know decided to go all yolo and
6964200	6972040	decided to grow a pair and said you know what the fuck no proposed you know so
6972040	6980840	and she happened to be in town yeah it's no no cuz you know firstly she lives out
6980840	6988280	skates and what it just felt the place you know she was initially shocked I

7029720	7033280	launch radio all one word on Skype if you would like to call us so I know that
7033280	7037600	wasn't really a lot to do with games but you know what cuz reginator calls into
7037600	7041440	this show all the time and I'm sure y'all are curious you know and you want
7041440	7047400	to hear the good news when things happen and he's family that's right he's fam so
7047400	7051120	we're happy for him here at orange lounge radio speaking of fam I think
7051120	7053840	we're getting another call on the line right now connecting so let's check in
7053840	7059560	hi you're on orange launch radio who's this it's the ringtone I thought I
7059560	7062760	should kind of have that as a real tone on my phone you probably could get it
7062760	7065200	y'all you probably just need a Windows phone it's alright I think it's
7065200	7069720	connected this time you shut your poor mouth even Bill Gates I think uses
7069720	7072600	nature all right no wait no look we got a caller on the line hi you're on
7072600	7076880	orange launch radio who's this it's Ron man I'm kind of speechless right now
7076920	7083240	because I heard somebody trash-talking a Windows phone yes keep in mind I don't
7083240	7086440	like any phone that isn't an iPhone cuz I only buy good stuff she's a she's a
7086440	7090000	fangirl oh yeah that I know it doesn't help the
7090000	7094600	fact that at work I have an iPhone and I'm sitting here looking at it I want to
7094600	7099480	build and make basic adjustments where I can do a Windows mobile and Android and
7099480	7103320	a friend was like oh yes swipe from the bottom I threw the phone across the room
7103320	7108680	and said I quit for the whole damn day I did it's bad enough I want to make a
7108680	7113280	ringtone create a phone to call ringtones drop the song in the system
7113280	7119300	will see it iPhone you gotta use iTunes go through iTunes I still can't do it go
7119300	7123900	dig it around found a program that is for trial where I just want one song as
7123900	7132720	my ringtone and that's it it took me five minutes tops yeah well it shouldn't
7133400	7137960	by just creating a folder on the phone itself it should automatically pick it
7137960	7142080	up I shouldn't need special software to do it and I'm just like all right all
7142080	7145640	right we didn't easy we didn't we didn't you I know your intention was not to
7145640	7149120	call in to talk about cell phones so what's on your mind tonight buddy was it
7149120	7156480	a couple of things um one I'm shook about this Atari box pardon me but I'm
7156480	7161880	summoning my inner techno nerd rage and some of Loki's rage you mean to tell me
7161920	7168440	an AMD powered console by Atari it's gonna run between two hundred and fifty
7168440	7176920	and three hundred dollars no no I can understand if it was an Intel yes I can
7176920	7182040	get that but unless they are opening up this console for not just for the
7182040	7187640	classic games where you can develop games for the Atari box I'm sold brand
7187640	7192880	new next-gen games retro games on an Atari box I'm so what it okay Ramit for
7192880	7196320	what it's worth I do think that's part of what they want to do they want to do
7196320	7201400	Minecraft Terraria they want to do those types of modern games it's not only
7201400	7206280	classic games I think that's important to put out there well that's good I'm
7206280	7211280	all for that because if this thing at this price is no more powerful than a
7211280	7215200	game queue or a weed then you know what it's gonna stay right on the shelf the
7215240	7219120	crowdfunding part of this kind of worries me too a dark to see it dark to
7219120	7223400	see it brings up a damn good point sounds like the Ouya but probably more
7223400	7227840	powerful but the okay let's yeah the I mean there's there's a few Ouya fans
7227840	7231320	left but for the most part like everybody was mega hype about the Ouya
7231320	7235800	and then like Ouya kind of who yucked out the door in like three months see
7235800	7240440	but the difference I see on the software aspect is Ouya was powered by Android
7240440	7244880	you can root and jump into that this is gonna be a pure Linux system where
7244880	7247920	they're gonna be locking it down a little bit more it's gonna be they're
7247920	7251160	gonna be able to do a little bit more with the hardware itself with the OS see
7251160	7255720	our buddy our buddy Brad from pod culture jumped in I liked my Ouya he's
7255720	7260480	but Brad I love you dude but you're the one Ouya fan that I know of out there
7260480	7264320	but that no I mean that's cool that's cool but most people were kind of you
7264320	7272040	know didn't really find the reason to get it eventually anyway you still with
7272040	7278560	us mama yeah I'm still here I'm still here bro it's all good anything else in
7278560	7284680	your mind to share super NES classic oh yes I understand everybody's like you
7284680	7289040	know what F Nintendo I'm gonna go out and get the roms I'm gonna go out and
7289040	7293460	emulate it I'm gonna go build my Raspberry Pi and all of this you know
7293460	7297000	what I actually thought about doing it cuz I have a Raspberry Pi but I won't do
7297000	7301760	it because I am that lazy I will not sit here and like Bobby Blackpool said spend
7301800	7305280	the whole afternoon putting it together no I ain't got time for that nobody got
7305280	7311200	time for that but I will say there are games on this this system from my
7311200	7315440	teenage years my childhood that I absolutely love and the main reason why
7315440	7320600	I will put in the attempt to get one is because of Secret of Mana that game got
7320600	7327200	me through a really hard time in my life I hope I have so many memories with
7327200	7332200	Final Fantasy 3 you know and yes I know it's really six but to 15 year old Rob
7332200	7335600	it was Final Fantasy 3 I have so many memories with that game like I can't
7335600	7340840	even I I can't even bro I used to rent father see three from the video store
7340840	7344640	and every time I returned I would re-rent it or if I couldn't re-rent it
7344640	7349760	I'd hope and pray that I'd remember what the what the subcode was on the game side
7349760	7353640	knew which one the rents I could pick up from my save game and hope and pray at
7353640	7361080	some asshole didn't delete it I I I threw diva fits I did whatever chores
7361080	7365240	had to be done I kissed ass I did everything it took to get Final Fantasy
7365240	7369440	3 once I played it at a friend's house that's what I did to get my Super
7369440	7375680	Nintendo period and then getting it for Christmas I was like yeah boy I love it
7375680	7381200	yeah I'm you know I probably that's fine if people want to do the emulator thing
7381240	7386280	then cool but I think there's there's some weird connection that some of us
7386280	7390120	have with the whole fact that it is the official Nintendo product and it is you
7390120	7392840	know the official channels there there's just something that just can't kind of
7392840	7396040	you also know there's been a lot of quality checks for something like this
7396040	7399960	that maybe haven't happened on the whole emulator side that I think are somewhat
7399960	7403840	important but you know I'm not gonna knock people that choose to do the
7403840	7409280	emulator thing you know more fine it is what it is but just understand that
7409280	7413560	there's people that want to do it this way too okay you know what you can go
7413560	7417840	out and do all that you can actually buy a 3d printed Super Nintendo shell to put
7417840	7422920	on your Raspberry Pi oh you can actually go that far you know you know let's
7422920	7425760	let's talk about this Rama let's talk about this is important I don't even
7425760	7430440	really like Raspberry Pi like lemon meringue is superior no no no no it's

7478200	7482000	the phone is actually ringing off the hook tonight because usually it's not
7482000	7485000	and I have to sit here and vamp for time now I just have to vamp for time because
7485000	7489760	this fucking tablet is slow to connect and that is definitely a goal before the
7489760	7493120	end of the year is to upgrade see and now I hung up on him son of a bitch
7493520	7497880	sorry buddy call back if you got this orange launch radio all one word on
7497880	7505800	Skype it is my goal before the end of the year to have this replaced so and I
7505800	7509280	when I say this I waved my hand at the studio stuff when I said this okay I
7509280	7512360	think we are connected this time and I can say hi you're on orange launch radio
7512360	7518760	who's this hi there's a deaf hey act F buddy how's it going not so great good
7519280	7525240	to see you but I'm sorry it's not so great what's what's wrong well it's the
7525240	7533320	next classic Amazon Amazon fucked you again didn't they you guessed it well I
7533320	7538640	read Twitter but here's the thing here's the thing didn't didn't you learn after
7538640	7545040	they wronged you last time one would think that one would think that that I
7545160	7550080	would have learned the lesson that I would have to stay away from Amazon no
7550080	7554320	look I'm teasing you a little bit I also understand I also understand that the
7554320	7558300	Super Nintendo classics were so desirable that people kind of went to
7558300	7563040	where they could get one so like I was able to get one at Best Buy which oh I
7563040	7568200	never told the story about why what how I ran into trouble at Best Buy sorry
7568200	7570720	deaf I'm gonna hijack your call for a minute but this is important problem all
7570760	7575120	right thank you you know at least you can watch okay so Jamie get this so I
7575120	7579880	pre-ordered my SNES classic on Best Buy when I was lucky and I found it on
7579880	7582440	Twitter and I fell in that 20-minute window and I get the pre-order there
7582440	7587480	right I go into Best Buy and they say what's your name and I give them my last
7587480	7590240	name that you would see on my credit card in my driver's license right and
7590240	7595760	they say we don't see that in the system and I'm like here we fucking go and I'm
7595760	7600640	thinking in my mind I knew I knew this is too fucking easy I knew I knew
7600640	7605280	it and it turns out they looked at my barcode and they're like we see you
7605280	7612920	here it looks like this is for Rob Roberts and I'm going fuck so as you
7612920	7616320	guys I'm sure know Rob Roberts yes that's my name here on Orange Launch
7616320	7620400	Radio that's my internet persona name but that is my fake name like Lady Gaga
7620400	7624280	uses a fake name right so that's just something I've always done since way
7624280	7627920	back when when Travis first got me into this he said you want to have a fake
7627920	7633520	name so that was it Rob Roberts right so I don't know how that ended up on my
7633520	7637600	Best Buy thing because I'm thinking like what but I wouldn't have that would have
7637600	7640720	it that's not the name on my credit card or that like how did that fucking get
7640720	7645120	connected to Rob Roberts well I'm thinking it might have somehow got tied
7645120	7648240	to my Facebook account because that's something you could do on Best Buy is
7648240	7652360	tied to your Facebook account so anyway so they and they wouldn't let me pick it
7652360	7655780	up because I didn't have any ID that showed that my name is Rob Roberts so
7655820	7659620	first thing I learned this week I need fake ID that says that I'm Rob Roberts
7659620	7664700	second thing is that but this and the the happy ending of the story because I
7664700	7669980	did finally get it I had to actually go on to the website in the store and put
7669980	7675700	Rob real last name as my pickup person to actually pick up the console and had
7675700	7678920	to wait there for like 10 minutes while it went through the system and the new
7678920	7682100	label printed out there and so you can actually see Jamie if you look at the
7682100	7688140	side of the box on that label it says my real name to pick up for my stage
7688140	7692580	name which is funny because again the critic yes she's making this face of I
7692580	7695940	think it's also stupid that they have stickies on here yeah I don't want a
7695940	7699500	little tack I I hope yeah they're low tack okay that's good cuz I didn't like
7699500	7702780	that either cuz there's no shrink wrap I almost said saran wrap a shrink wrap on
7702780	7706660	that anyway there you go there's my story I don't know how my fucking stage
7706660	7710180	name got on my Best Buy order when again that's not the name on my credit card
7710220	7714220	but I have I have had stuff stuff shipped to the house under my stage name
7714220	7719060	but usually that's like game companies sending me the very rare review copy or
7719060	7722380	things like that because they're not gonna know me as my real last name they
7722380	7727780	know me as Rob Roberts which most people on the internet do but anyway that's my
7727780	7732420	whole my whole issue so but unfortunately act theft I know my story
7732420	7736660	had a happy ending I just was slightly inconvenienced but yours we don't have a
7736740	7744140	happy ending yet do we no it's it it's terrible because and and I was going to
7744140	7750620	a point with with with actually learning from Amazon and not ordering from them
7750620	7755180	but at least the previous times that they happen with the switch is having
7755180	7760020	with a splatoon it even happened with Pokken Pokken DX it even happened there
7760020	7766180	but at least I got a confirmation from them that I would get it right now
7766420	7773460	anyone and I mean anyone ordered from Amazon doesn't know shit about when it's
7773460	7778900	going to get fulfilled what's really frustrating about that whole thing and
7778900	7783060	where I would be at in that position is that meanwhile the fucking treasure
7783060	7787460	trucks showed up from Amazon selling those things in different cities and
7787460	7791540	then what did it show up on prime now as well I feel like it did in some places
7791540	7797780	it didn't show up in prime now but it showed up on instant pickup which is
7797780	7804860	different because they I think they like send it to a place like that something
7804860	7809660	like a p.o. box oh you can pick up there so and this isn't and of course the
7809660	7812820	first thing I was gonna ask is is the fact that you're in Mexico have a
7812820	7815740	complication on this but you actually do you have you have these things delivered
7815740	7822020	to a u.s. address right yeah I have a u.s. address that a friend and I share
7822020	7827780	basically yeah yeah it's it's also like a p.o. box but it's for all type of mail
7827780	7836220	yeah exactly but yeah I have to do that because if I try to buy a SNES mini here
7836220	7841700	in Mexico it's around the end that's this is a retail price it's not even
7841700	7850140	like a scalper price it's around $140 Wow yeah it's cheaper to rent the
7850140	7858660	fucking p.o. box it's crazy way cheaper Wow and it's crazy yeah yeah Amazon
7858660	7863060	really owes their customers a really fucking good explanation I mean here's
7863060	7869660	the reality I can tell you right now the Amazon that ships the SNES mini to your
7869660	7873940	house is not the same Amazon that runs those treasure trucks and that's the
7873940	7876860	reality that that's why this is happening they are separate companies
7876860	7880700	that are well they're separate branches of the organization running under the
7880700	7884180	same name that doesn't think I'm not excusing it but that's what's happening
7884180	7889260	but the problem is most people don't understand that and most people see it's
7889260	7893700	Amazon and why the fuck is Amazon screwing me over while meanwhile the
7893700	7897920	trucks are pulling into major metropolis cities where maybe I don't even relive
7897960	7902480	and letting people buy these things that ought to be mine that I pre-ordered and
7902480	7909400	yeah I'm not I'm not angry towards the the treasure trucks or instant pickup
7909400	7915600	because people got got their SNES classic that way and I'm happy for them
7915600	7921400	I'm really happy kind of salty but happy at the end because sure it's it's
7921400	7926040	something they want it's not their fault Amazon it's not their fault yeah yeah
7926040	7931760	and and the only thing I would want from Amazon right now is to explain this
7931760	7938520	stuff yes because Amazon hasn't said a word about it that's the most
7938520	7943920	frustrating part that Amazon that hasn't acknowledged this and all of the people
7943920	7951720	all of us who stayed up late and I August 22nd at 1 30 a.m. I can't I
7951760	7959320	remember exactly when I pre-ordered this thing we got screwed badly and we don't
7959320	7966080	know even if we're gonna get a SNES classic soon and I really and it's like
7966080	7971000	my god somebody I I am with you a hundred percent active somebody needs to
7971000	7975720	hold Amazon's feet to the fire on this so I don't know if I have journalist
7975720	7978160	friends that listen to this show I know I have a couple but I don't know if
7978160	7981480	they're listening to every episode every minute but if I have any journalist
7981480	7985280	friends that have connections out there that are doing a story on this somebody
7985280	7989320	needs to grill Amazon's PR department on how this happened and by the way
7989320	7994580	something something to think about what else does Amazon own that's under the
7994580	7999440	same umbrella with gaming twitch TV and one big thing that they're pushing on
7999440	8004760	twitch right now is help us sell video games on twitch well I'm gonna ask this
8004760	8009040	give twitch twitch if you want me to help you sell video games how are you
8009040	8011680	gonna guarantee that you're actually gonna give them to people because you're
8011680	8014440	all Amazon at the end of the day even though yes twitch is a different
8014440	8018680	building than Amazon treasure truck and Amazon how are you gonna guarantee that
8018680	8022600	the people I'm gonna push to buy things on and I say that as a twitch affiliate
8022600	8026880	how are you going to make sure that the people that buy games on Amazon get them
8026880	8030160	when they think they're gonna get them and when they're promised them that's
8030160	8035480	exactly I would like to hear people asking of twitch yeah exactly there's
8035480	8039520	there's tons of stuff going wrong with Amazon right now and especially with
8039520	8045720	whether gaming pre-orders and all that stuff is and it's crazy that it isn't
8045720	8052200	even like mentioned in any game journal or gaming blog out there because I have
8052200	8058080	Church I'm I'm trying to look for answers to say to see if Amazon has said
8058080	8065600	something that if anyone has already received their SNES classic but no we
8065600	8070840	haven't seen anything and it's again frustrating because I ordered to one for
8070840	8075560	me and one for a friend who lives in Mexico City mm-hmm and I really want
8075560	8081200	that to have it right like as soon as possible because another friend of ours
8081200	8087360	is going to Mexico City and I wouldn't have to pay for shipping yeah but if
8087360	8091360	have to pay for shipping I would have to pay for importation fees the the
8091360	8098880	shipping self and it's gonna be another 50 to more even more dollars that yeah
8098880	8102640	we really don't want to spend well active for what it's worth I'm gonna
8102640	8107120	cross my fingers and my toes tomorrow is Monday and if business things are gonna
8107120	8110400	happen maybe Monday you'll get your answer you know it all went down on a
8110400	8114280	Friday so maybe Monday Amazon will have some answers but if Amazon doesn't
8114400	8118560	produce some answers on Monday then I would call on any of my folks with
8118560	8121600	connections out there who do these stories where they get to interview
8121600	8125320	Amazon or interview twitch ask these hard questions people like act deaf need
8125320	8129680	you to ask these questions so all right my friend I'm gonna let you go and hope
8129680	8133400	for the best for you okay hey thanks for having keep us posted we'll check in
8133400	8138680	next week okay sure all right take care buddy all right I think that is gonna do
8138680	8142160	it for the Skype line tonight I'm gonna definitely be watching his twitch to see
8142160	8146160	if he gets that SNES classic or any of my friends that ordered on Amazon get
8146160	8150960	their SNES classic but I think we're about to wrap up tonight's show that's
8150960	8153680	it for another additional orange unless you had a last-minute story you wanna
8153680	8157920	talk about our soccer I don't know I did find an interesting story about the in
8157920	8166000	fact I actually reposted on my Jamie Summers fan page on Facebook if people
8166000	8172000	would like to maybe give it a like but I posted about the resurgence of a pinball
8172000	8178600	itself that after a sharp decline pinball has actually gone back into the
8178600	8185000	rise with over 35,000 international tournaments so and then of course we
8185000	8189720	have more and more machines being released and I it makes it makes my dark
8189720	8197760	heart a little bit brighter to know that that's happening any any thoughts on why
8197760	8201520	like why pinball is it just maybe just kind of the whole like nostalgia thing
8201520	8205880	like I think a good bit of it is nostalgia I think the other thing comes
8205880	8212600	with it actually being some sort of you know a tactile sensation it's it's a
8212600	8216940	game that you are more directly interacting with whether it's you know
8216940	8221880	you know shaking the table you know without tilting it right or catching the
8221880	8227040	ball and doing tricks with it it requires I think a lot a higher degree
8227040	8231400	of skill but anyone can pick it up you know in some ways you know we make we
8231400	8235920	make fun of the whole pachinko machine craze in Japan sometimes about oh
8235920	8238920	Castlevania is gonna be a pachinko machine and all this stuff but in a way
8238920	8243640	in a way pinball is kind of what we have instead of pachinko yeah in a way I mean
8243640	8247080	right because it's it's similar they had their origins in the same place exactly
8247080	8250280	they have their oranges in the same place so you know and I think if if
8250280	8255080	Konami were to say we're gonna make a Castlevania pinball game most people
8255080	8259320	would be like fucking rad yeah yeah talk to Stern Stern's the one making them
8259320	8266340	which by the way our coin op has a has Lexi light speed which that one is
8266340	8272360	supposed to be it's really a first of its type it's a supposed to be a modular
8272360	8281920	table that has a video play field so the interactive elements are when it hits a
8281920	8288520	target it changes on the the play field it's full video and it was really fun
8288520	8293800	and it's supposed to be able to be modded into other pinball tables so all
8293800	8297780	right well I think on that note then we're gonna wrap up another additional
8297780	8300440	orange laundry oh I want to thank you guys for listening to the show tonight
