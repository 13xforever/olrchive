This week WWE 2K18 has been released and the internet is weighing in on the finger
licking Colonel Sanders who's going to grill you up and serve you on a platter.
And that's just one piping hot story.
Stay tuned for the rest of the night's news served to order starting right now on the
show where every gamer has a voice.
Orange Lounge Radio Hello my friends out there on the internet
welcome back it's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice it is Orange
Lounge Radio live tonight episode number 704 for this October the 15th of 2017 my name
is Rob Roberts joining you from our headquarters here in Sacramento California by my side as
she always is DarkSakura or Jamie Summers oh hi how are you okay yeah yeah any exciting
fun things is no rock concerts this week to speak of no yeah so this week couldn't nearly
have been as good as last week with gorillas and everything right just a week of self improvement
there you go there you go a moment of zen a week of zen focusing on me there you go
I I get myself the best birthday gifts I hope you treat yourself as well or as they say
on Parks and Rec treat yourself though I still owe somebody here some Legos hey that
sounds like I just haven't had time to go out don't worry about it a treat for Tech
Master Loki over there yes what you don't want more Legos no I I always want more Legos
is whether it's gonna happen how how many times have you stepped on a Lego brick barefoot
because we all know that's like one of the worst things that could possibly happen to
you it's not I used to walk on them so I mean it's fine so I found out this week that
Loki and I both like the same show I know we don't talk a lot about TVs and movies here
on OLR because you know we have other shows here at the voice geeks network where we do
tape live Sunday nights at six o'clock Pacific's nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby
Black Wolf show we have a lot of great shows here to talk about that stuff we don't really
get to talk about it here as much but I found out that you and I are both big fans of the
show called the good place yes it's a really funny show it is hilarious I started binge
watching I don't even know what made me do it I think I think just a lot of my friends are
talking about how funny it was as I was like all right it's like a 25 minute show I won't
take that long I like marathoned the first season in like two and a half days yeah we
ran out of episodes so yeah and there's only it's only on its second season so it's pretty
easy yeah it started second season yeah so I liked it a lot I thought it was really funny
so I don't want to spoil it too much well the the premise is that the main character who's
Kristen Bell who was Veronica Mars right but she's a little older now she she died and she
wakes up in the good place which is the opposite of the bad place so she would you know because
obviously I don't think the show wants to get too religious so it's about her you know adventures
in the good place and the people that she meets and the maybe not so good things that are happening
well yes in the main twist which they kind of reveal in the first episode is that she's not
really supposed to be there yeah it's a mistake yes yes that is in the first episode so he's not
really spoiling anything too crazy and so it's kind of her trying to fake it and you know try
to make it into you know this thing and then all sorts of crazy stuff happens yeah so who's your
favorite character because my favorite character on that whole show is Evil Janet pretty good I
I also like I can't remember his name the the dude that plays like the silent monk Oh
Johnny Johnny yeah yeah yes but yes it's true his trooper yes yes not to spoil anything but
yeah hisself itself yes I like how his interactions uh let's see I know it's John who was his name I
think John it was his name anyway I when I watch a show like that I can tie it see watch I can tie
anything back to video games because the way they present that the good place is kind of built is
that like there's this architect that creates the good place for a certain number of people it's
totally like the sims like I swear the people that invented that show probably thought how
could we turn the sims into a TV show like is it just me or does that does it feel like a lot
yeah yeah without all the like death traps and stuff yeah without all of that so I'm going to
chat over at live.vognetwork.com a couple people starting with a Kossen saying you can talk to me
about the Orville which I'm hearing a lot of good things about I haven't gotten around to that yet
because I've been watching Star Trek Discovery which you know I realize a lot of people are
watching Orville instead of Star Trek Discovery which cheap plug I did appear on starboard power
coupling this week so if you want to check out our synopsis of episode 4 go check out those kids
the starboard power coupling podcast which is part of vognetwork it's it's there under our podcast
course I got to get in the stranger thing season 2 when they come oh shit that's like only two
weeks away that's two weeks exciting and that's as we got into last week that's a game now too
yep it is dark soccer is there anything you're watching on the telly nope no I don't really
like TV but you've watched a few things like you guys watch the Castlevania anime which I still
need to do I watch things when they come out and then I get it over with yeah so I watched
stranger things I'm gonna watch the next season I watched Jessica Jones and I watched Luke Cage
and I watched Defenders okay and I tried to watch iron fist but it was completely fucking ridiculous
some stuff I'm not watching anything okay okay right now I see what you mean so like you you
wait and then you like binge it all at once and then it's done I get it okay oh the one thing I
am continuously watching every time an episode comes out is Dragon Ball super okay that's it
and you know I'll have RuPaul's Drag Race in January yeah so will you yeah I'll watch Drag
Race that one now no I know that's a lie if you're gonna try to tell me as for anything on TV right
now no I'm not watching anything I'm mostly a YouTube watcher so I watch the cuisine of the
18th century with James Townsend and son speaking of well sorry if I don't want to interrupt or
anything but I was gonna say speaking of YouTube actually one channel that's been putting out stuff
in the interim is awesome games done quick they do these little I don't know what they're called
but they're like small little turn it like tournament runs type that they're doing so
they did one the other day that was it's a link to the past randomizer and so what that means is
basically all the drops like the different items are randomized in the actual the Legend of Zelda
randomizer yes so they it's final fantasy randomizer like original NES Final Fantasy
randomizer and I think it's a similar concept yeah so that was kind of fun I watched that for
a good couple hours the other day but yeah they've been putting out content like almost once a week
but the other thing that I'm watching regularly on YouTube is outside Xbox mm-hmm which is a UK
like gaming top best-of list and they don't just stick to Xbox stuff I'm just saying that you know
it's really funny they have some good perspectives and I've actually picked up a few like I didn't
know the threshold trick in Mass Effect 2 where if you do when you're doing grunt's loyalty mission
there's a particular screw that you can stand behind and just shoot and shoot and shoot and
the thing can't hit you but you can hit it I know about that there you go I just go headfirst into
everything I always forget that YouTube is like a thing that people can like legitimately watch
shows on like it's a very different sort of thing and you'd think I'd be more aware because I've
always been very like rah rah rah do a podcast make a podcast so you'd think I'd be the same
way for YouTube and TV and I am but I just don't find that I have the time to sit down I watch
little things here and there but I don't get into a lot of series I also watch a lot of the NHK TV
shows so I mean I don't watch them regularly so I can't say I am watching them but I'll go through
just big bursts of watching like begin Japan ology or bento or was it called lunch on it's all about
bento and you know certain like arts and crafts shows I'm and I watch a lot of history stuff on
YouTube because I love fucking I love documentaries I love history I like documentaries too but like
more like socially based ones I don't watch a lot of like the history like wars and stuff I like the
social I like the history ones where they go into how events unfolded and affected people more of the
I guess combination of anthropology sociology and history so that because I think that if you don't
look at history through the lens of someone who experienced it then you can't see how it applies
to modern life and too many people don't want to look at history oh that was terrible it was a war
ba ba ba ba ba you know what I mean but when you look at it through the people's eyes what they
suffered and then we see what's happening today oh my god you will cry because fuck what's going
on right now I like watching it's totally trash but the internet historian on YouTube and he does
kind of documentary type features of trolling in memes and stuff and it's it's it's actually kind
of fascinating because it's stuff that I would have never heard about but they go into great
detail about stuff like balloon boy or you know dash con and all those weird stuff that they do
just I don't know it's pretty funny I mean it's it's trash because it's like these people are
trolling people right but it's it's entertaining to watch from an outside perspective right okay
well speaking I do want to mention real quick because I don't think it made our show world
tonight but I saw it floating around out there because you brought up awesome games done quick
yeah the schedule is out for the next awesome games done quick which would be the winter one
in a couple mad why are you mad well disappointed why is that because Super Metroid isn't on the
last Super Metroid I don't know if that's about whatever happened you know last year but I'm also
disappointed because our pal and friend of the show Flaco Jones submitted for PT and again sadly
did not get in but you know they got a lot of talented people I was looking because they
actually have posted like what they accepted and what they rejected oh my god like there's a lot I
mean it's no wonder Flaco is submitted several times it keeps getting bumped because there's
just tons of stuff that gets submitted maybe they can do another one three times a year so many
speedrunners out there for sure maybe he can do his own marathon for charity and donate it to the
awesome games done quick actually I would I would love to see you know I know we've been talking
about it for a long time and maybe we're gonna need some help from some people that are better
event planners than we are such as the folk that folks that do sack gamer collective I believe is
the new name you know our pals over there because especially with all the wildfires that's been
going on here in Northern California I'd really love to see I don't know if you guys know but
like an old friend of the show DDR angel she was like luckily last I heard everything's okay but I
know like her life got turned upside down by the evacuations and all that stuff and I'm sure she's
not the only one that we know of that listens to the show that's that's really run into a problem
so it'll be really cool if we can kind of do something to help because it's been you know
even here in Sacramento I mean we're fine guys we're like a hundred miles from everything but
like the air has been toxic here like I kind of have to stay indoors it's fine today but I mean
like Monday Tuesday we're it's still hazy though yeah so I mean did you see from San Francisco as
well oh yeah it was pretty terrible I just like the post that's not fog yeah this time um but the
I do well Dan has worked done a marathon for Child's Play before and we've got all the stuff
set up at my house that we could stream okay so all we have to do is just set up an account for
donations and then donate the whole thing to whichever charity is handling the wildfires it
wouldn't be that hard yeah we'll figure something out maybe hopefully in the coming months because
you know it's not like the needs are gonna go away in two months so we'll see what we can do
so and all else fails there are charities lots of worthy causes I'm associated with one so yeah
anyway I did want to mention in chat real quick because I think this is a good point over at live
dot vog network comm Bobby black wolf who's on before us says in chat we all know super
Metroid will be a donation incentive so there is that maybe we don't know the the final final
answers yet so that's a that's good Brad from pod culture says 24 hours of vog game streaming
I'm sure there's enough of us I hey even if we raised a hundred bucks I'd be thrilled that's
a hundred bucks they didn't have before so you know if it's a small turnout who cares you don't
do it for the size of turnout you do it for the the donations and awareness even if it's just a
little awareness so all right well anyhow I do want to get into some other gaming content and
some of the news would talk about at the top of the show because I know we went on some nerd
tangents but it's been I don't think we have a lot a lot of news tonight but of course I say that
and those are the four-hour shows so let's kick off tonight's talking about loot boxes because it
seems like just in general the concept of loot boxes has been in the news a lot especially this
seems to be getting worse and what if the problem here's what it is is a lot of people dismiss loot
boxes as oh it's cosmetic oh this and that right we've been seeing lately with a lot of games that
they're specifically creating these games to push loot boxes or they're taking aspects of the game
out to put them in loot boxes because they can make extra money and loot boxes are finding like
a free-to-play game or even fine like I even I don't blame overwatch too much because that is
just cosmetic stuff well I I kind of think that overwatch is the reason everybody's course of
course watch wasn't the first bite but like blizzard fans are like I'm trying to think of
a tactful way to say this but blizzard fans are different than a lot of other types of gamers and
I say that having done a World of Warcraft podcast for several years which you guys all know
Hoard House was on the network okay so I was a part of that community and it's a great community
I'm not talking negative at all I'm just saying that the blizzard fans are very loyal to blizzard
products and when blizzard does this is why I realized that even though not everybody gets it
like why destiny 2 is in the battle net launcher it's a brilliant move by Activision to sell more
destiny 2 on PC to an audience that probably didn't check it out on console I mean I'm I'm
sorry you may not like totally understand that but the way the the blizzard crowd is if they
can spend the money that they're making on gold in World of Warcraft or what have you on destiny
to another game they're gonna do it so like that was that was a move that was frankly brilliant by
Activision I mean whether it's not the nice thing to do or not but anyway Activision's been aggressive
pretty bad with this stuff and not only me even before destiny 2 with Call of Duty modern warfare
remastered they just injected loot boxes in there it's like that what the fuck the original game
didn't have that and now of course I'm assuming with the new Call of Duty and with advanced
warfare I think even has that system shadow of war was a pretty big one that they just kind of
added this up in there and then of course the one that released Italy got people pissed off
it will force up the new force the game has that which is more of like a pay-to-earn type scheme
but then the more of a pay-to-win type scheme with battlefront 2 member valve for it too they're like
oh hey yeah we're gonna release all these maps for free it's you're not gonna we're not just gonna
sell you really shitty base game and then force you to buy all the maps now we're gonna offer it
to you for free but of course then they're gonna throw in this loot box system that's got a lot of
mods that actually do affect gameplay you know something if you actually level up and that is
actually I believe the system to level up in the game is tied to the loot boxes so it's unavoidable
that's really really similar to overwatch overwatch does the free maps the free characters and as you
level up you get loot box no I it's the other way around oh you don't level up get loot boxes you
have to get loot boxes to level oh that's that's a little yeah that's like a little what can we
change to be a little shadier and okay interesting so I do want to get some comments in our shower
because I know you have some news like why are we bringing this up tonight loot boxes are nothing
new in the gaming community but there's definitely some activity we're seeing this week but I want to
get to our chat over at live dot vog network comm a stoppie and chat says I used to have no opinion
on it but yes I'm seeing a lot of instances now where content seems to be cut out and held hostage
in loot boxes let's see Carson says I like the loot boxes that do boxed CE and LE version of
PC games but they're too expensive for me dungeon buster says loot boxes are just extensions of the
mobile model thanks mobile gaming kaijuto and chat says the reason why they only do cosmetic
is because we don't like pay-to-win look at what's going on with 2k 18 loot boxes have been going
around since we had browser games but it certainly does feel like you know browser games I think are
kind of one thing because browser games are free to play mobile games are free to play right but
overwatch was $60 yeah that's not even this and it's not well oh right I know I'm only picking on
a watch no watch is a good example because I think it's done correctly I don't think there's
really an issue there because it's it is strictly cosmetic for me I don't give a shit about the
cosmetic stuff so it's it's cool to get one every now and then it's like oh that's a pretty cool
skin I'm not like oh man I really got it like but you know there's people that are like that
but there are kind of on them right and wait how you choose to spend your money which if you want
to buy a hundred loot boxes so you can get that symmetric dragon skin well hey it is a pretty
sweet skin but with that though I mean there's definitely been a lot of people that have been
opposed to it because yeah it is something that's kind of out that whole free-to-play model but you
paid $60 for the game and then because it's not really the full game because you need all the DLC
because that's been sliced out of the game as well so you to pay for the season pass as well
and then they want you to pay for these loot boxes or paid modifications as Bethesda likes
to do with you oh hey this modification is it happens to be 800 you know virtual currency
points or whatever but you can only buy the currency points in 750 so you really have to
spend $15 you get to get this other thing it it's just they tried to like cheat people in the best
way possible because they they know they make money and they know well these fans of the game
they're just gonna they're gonna be fine with it because it's just okay though they'll be annoyed
but they'll still buy the game and yeah that seems to be the case with a lot of like destiny
2 players they're fine with it because they the game is good but you know the loot boxes are still
there attempting people miss dark Sakura over there in the fluffy chair I'm curious on your
hot take on loot boxes because I know you don't really do overwatch but you have done mobile
games you've done Mass Effect had him yeah Dragon Age had him so what's your hot take on loot boxes
are you okay with them are you kind of I'm okay that I don't multiplayer that much in overwatch
makes me sick so it's not my problem right but what about the other games you do play that have
them what games do I play that have those effects I don't do multiplayer in it anymore okay and I
never did multiplayer in Dragon Age okay so okay I thought you kind of did more loot boxes back when
like Mass Effect 3 was I did it for Mass Effect 3 but I didn't pay for any of them it's not always
multiplayer games either shadow of war and granted it has a multiplayer aspect to it but right it's
in the single-player right well she doesn't have needed to be fair neither do I yeah I none of this
it doesn't matter to me okay I mean the only loot boxes I care about is the Pusheen loot crate oh
you mean physical loot box right well this tangible stuff you know what actually let's talk about that
because doesn't this phenomenon kind of exists in the real world any no okay any convention I go
to any of them always have for sale those little question mark bricks that for like 20 bucks and
they say two of them have a NES classic or something really highly desirable in them the
rest of them have bullshit unload overstock stuff but because it's nerd stuff nobody really gets
upset because they're like okay yeah that's like a raffle or gambling it's an I am Groot ruler
something you know it's oh I needed a ruler but yeah I mean so there's been a lot of like kind of
pushback with loot boxes because of all I mean recently there's just been a ton of games tons
of big games coming out of it all have them and all kind of unnecessarily have them basically so
what's some of the stuff going around this week if you don't mind so of course you know they've
turned to the different ratings boards to kind of get their hot take on it as well the ESRB says
you know they don't consider loot boxes to be gambling they just you know it's because I think
mainly you don't actually you know win money from it you they don't see it as something of like
value you're not really like it's it's not the same format as gambling basically they say yes
our B does not consider loot boxes to be gambling while there is an element of chance in these
mechanics the player is always guaranteed to receive in-game content even if the player
unfortunately receives something they don't want we think of it as a similar principle to a
collectible card game sometimes you open a pack and get brand new holographic card you had your
eye on for a while but other times you'll end up with a pack of cards you already have so they're
saying that because you get something each time it's not really considered gambling I think they
make a darn good point with the fact that magic the gathering isn't considered a gambling and it's
a similar type of deal yeah I can support that I mean you're right like you can't turn around and
sell you know Blizzard walked away from that Diablo 3 auction house a long time ago and they
don't really have anything like that in any of their other games maybe if something like that
still existed and I mean I know Diablo 3 doesn't do loot boxes but let's make believe it did you
know then maybe that would be gambling because you could turn around and sell the stuff that you get
in the blue boxes that doesn't exist to be clear that doesn't exist but could could could it in five
years is that like is that how we're gonna get out of it comp being gambling is that you're saying
that you always get something well you know what if what you get is essentially worthless it it is
it is a game of chance but it's not gambling there's a difference again magic the gathering
isn't gambling right so and you know but but that analogy is absolutely right in magic the
gathering you're not gonna get Sarah Angel it's like the one card I can't remember the name of
you're not gonna get a Sarah Angel every booster pack just because you want one in fact you might
buy like some of my friends did in high school that we all played you might buy 20 packs trying
to get a hypnotic specter oh no that I did am I have my nailing these carny has been a long time
I just don't originate or sitting there screaming or a shivin dragon my magic knowledge is is in the
pooper or you know back in the black border days oh I got a Lotus let me did you play like a black
I bet you played like a black deck black like my tournament deck was a black deck with Lord of the
Pit and hypnotic specters I had a black white and red deck my tournament deck I found out I played
it just to find out that it actually got banned the next tournament oh shoot I made it like fourth
place okay all right well there you go see we and we weren't gambling at all all right and then of
course Peggy they have their approach you know basically saying our approach is similar that of
the SRB I think all ratings board do you SK in Germany as well the main reason is for that we
cannot define what constitutes gambling that is the responsibility of the National Gambling
Commission our gambling content descriptor is given to games that simulate or teach gambling
as it's done in real life casinos racetracks etc have Gambling Commission were to state that loop
boxes are a form of gambling then we would have to adjust our criteria to that interesting so this
is about the advisory and why a game like Vegas Stakes on the Super Nintendo let's say because I
don't know why but it's the first casino game that comes to my mind probably because it's still one
of the best of this day Vegas Stakes would get a gambling warning because if you remember that
game it was about you actually played blackjack you played crap what were the games in that it
was like blackjack craps slot machine I remember they were like fuck you know maybe it was like
five games in there I remember that was the one where like random people would come up to you
while you're playing the game and there would be like the little like that's what kind of made it
unique is that there'd be the little like they'd say oh can you help me by giving me a hundred
dollars or whatever and sometimes they'd it was that was gambling too sometimes you'd they'd come
back or they'd run away forever you never see the money again sometimes they'd be like I won a
lottery and thing and I'm gonna give you part of the prize because you helped me and you made more
money you remember that game no anyone Jamie you know the old classic games very well Vegas Stakes
Super Nintendo remember that I didn't play it I swear to God next time you're gone classic I don't
I don't like gambling really so being that you know the ESRB and Peggy can't really rule on it
some other sites have taken to make a more you know apparent approach against this basically saying
listen we're gonna take a stand against this we're not really you know for it let's make a way that
we can make people aware of this so one of those sites that's taking aim at this is open critic
and they're actually looking into ways that they can basically display what kind of loot boxes are
in a game your weather game has loot boxes you know if it's pay to win that type of stuff what
about the whole thing and I know you don't really have an answer for this but I know a couple months
ago on the show we were talking about how China was pushing an issue where because you know
overwatch is doing well there too but China was gonna make them publish what the percentage was
of rare because we kind of don't know like what the percentage is like what is the chance that
you're gonna get symmetrous dragon skin you don't know like you just know that sometimes rare stuff
shows up but China was gonna make them publish the numbers but then I think I heard that recently
blizzard found a way around it like they now you buy currency in the game and that's all you're
spending money on you use the currency to get loot boxes or something like that like they're able
they're able to get around they got around it somehow in China exactly we still don't know what
those rates they were the making sort of gambling laws regarding loot boxes they would just change
the way that they're doing so they can skirt around them so that's one site at least that's
looking to do that but let me let me ask you this let me ask you this hard question and everybody in
chat as well would you base your decision on if you're gonna buy a game or not on whether it has
loot boxes and I asked that to our chat as well live fog network calm while I asked Loki and
depends what kind of blue boxes if it's gonna be like you know overwatch where it's just cosmetic
stuff for multiplayer then yeah I'm fine with that if it's something that's gonna be basically
heavily involved in the game like shadow war or Forza or you know some of these that have basically
in one game you've had it you know as a feature now it's a consumable and you that features gone
because it's locked behind loot boxes where it seems like a you know massive cash grab from the
publisher then no I probably would avoid the game just fucking wait for Nintendo to decide they're
gonna start doing loot boxes I guess I kind of do they in the mobile games I I bet this
Animal Crossing mobile does loot boxes just you wait that's fine once again that's yeah
it's a free game you know what you're you're paying nothing for the game they can throw
whatever the fuck they want at you I mean honestly that's it's my that's my opinion if if it's a free
game you're playing you're losing nothing if you quit that game it's it the problem comes to like
if it's Super Mario Odyssey and everything is locked behind a loot box then I'm gonna be
fucking pissed because I paid $60 for the game so this metacritic or open critic or whatever was
you said was looking at the advisories they need to probably clarify what kind of loot box it is
besides just putting out a loot box warning like there because there's a difference between
cosmetic only loot boxes and or if it's like a loot box that's in you know with in-game currency
that you earn in the game you don't pay real money for dungeon buster just brought that up in our
chat room saying the new Assassin's Creed game has that you can buy them but you can also use
in-game currency and they've been very clear to say you can use in-game currency to buy the loot
boxes right well that's you can do that and I think shadow war as well but you know of course
they're gonna make the in-game currency hard to get and you know take forever and yeah tiger
call on chat says these so-called loot boxes seem to only apply to multiplayer games you won't see
loot boxes on single-player games was that the well shadow or the shadow war technically does
have a multiplayer portion but the the thing though is most of that is meant for the single
player game like in the end of the game it's very grindy and that's where that comes into play but
yeah it just so happened me most games nowadays are they have a multiplayer portion to them right
so it's gonna be hard to find a game that doesn't but like some of the games that they mentioned
NBA 2k 18 has them you know I remember Oh Bobby Blackwell says fours of seven has loot boxes a
single player yes so maybe this trend is yeah continuing and some folks in chat you know Rama
dungeon buster both saying no this would not influence their decision dungeon buster elaborating
I don't like the trend is represented in battlefront 2 but not all games implement loot box rewards the
same way so hmm and dungeon buster saying I've been playing shadow of war and have not opened a
single loot box I agreed but not checkmarked the legal agreement at the start interesting okay so
I mean and to be fair I can't really judge the loot boxes and shadow war because I'm not playing
that game oh yeah they said that most of the game you don't really need you know the loot boxes are
really you can use them but it's not gonna be like super important it's just towards the end
of the game the endgame stuff that to get the true ending you're gonna really need to level
your characters because it's really hard to defeat the last or you know stave off the last
few raids or whatever and that's where it becomes more tempting to get the true ending so speaking
of loot boxes now we had some continued development and shadow of war actually right so now this is
one of those things that doesn't surprise me how the player base is responded right Loki yes so
of course you know with anything that people don't like they're gonna hack it they're gonna mod it so
that's what happened apparently they have found a way to get loads of the Mirian which I guess is
the in-game currency to keep buying loot chests forever and so I guess there's I'm using like
just basic programs like the cheat engine allow you to get the in-game currency so that's not
unexpected hackers gonna hack no patch it over put some anti-cheat yeah isn't the economy or
whatever you want to call it like already kind of hosed I'm really surprised it is like because
blizzard somehow seems to have never had this happen but I would assume like blizzard games
pretty much at this point have to always be connected that's the other thing about blizzard
games blizzard breaks all these rules that you'd like you know oh the community is never gonna
allow that our community's gonna push back on this blizzard gets away with it every every damn
time blizzards up on that stage Oh Diablo 3 you're so beautiful right you're a model but you look
like Linda eventually stuff right exactly problem with Diablo 3 beam online only I mean when the
servers weren't working but there's so how long did that last how long did that last people give
we forgave and forget we forgave I forgot the the auction house controversy and maybe I'm part
of the problem I love Diablo 3 now I love it now this is just online passes all over again because
they're gonna make the excuse that we need extra money to run our games up you know what you make
tons of money because you're not paying your fucking employees enough you're not paying you
know the royalties to people that like they would get in other industries so stop fucking complain
mm-hmm and to be fair to blizzard I think and I think this is important to say ask somebody who
is a blizzard fan and plays a lot of blizzard games I think part of the reason they get away
with like overwatch is always online and there's really nothing you can do about it is because they
make fucking quality aims like blizzard doesn't really make bad games at least not my opinion I
mean they misfired with Diablo 3 but they did what they had to do to fix it you know what I mean like
that's that's how blizzard gets away with it so just you know to be clear blizzard gets away with
it because they make fucking rock-solid games everybody wants to play so anyway is there
anything else on loot box I thought we have one other little tidbit no that was it oh is it okay
well there you go so yeah loot boxes in games there you go I think we will move on into our
gaming weeks but first a little I'll do housekeeping first real fast we are not going to be here and
actually my co-hosts are gonna hear this for the first time but I've been saying this for a couple
weeks that we probably won't be here Veterans Day weekend we're definitely not gonna be here
Veterans Day weekend because I am definitely going to be out of town so Alan and I decided
we're gonna go Seattle cuz we want to it like Southwest had a big sale so we got tickets like
80 bucks to Seattle so why not that's pretty good right it's a pretty good price right we were
looking at some other places but it was still a lot of money for Chicago and I think we're looking
at Vegas and but Seattle was like dirt cheap so we're like let's do it we we went to Seattle for
our five-year anniversary we had a great time so and I know a couple people up there so we'll go
back and do some of the stuff we didn't do the first time so there you go so for that reason we
will not be having a show Veterans Day weekend and that is November 13th I think cuz veterans
do we live why oh no we fly back on the 13th November 12th is the date of the show so no show
that day all right we're gonna move in to our gaming weeks and talking about the types of games
we have been playing this week dark soccer stepped out for just a moment so I'll go ahead and start
with Loki and how was your gaming week I didn't play too much unfortunately because I had planned
to play a bunch of things but I once again am still stuck with being obsessed with Legos and
not necessarily building Legos I've been actually doing stuff when one of the why started with a
Lego digital designer and then I moved on to this other program called stud I O which allows you to
manipulate things a little bit better than the Lego digital designer because they don't let you
just drop bricks in there in certain ways so I was been messing with that but I did play some games
I picked up because I've been checking like we have a target near or by and so they always have
stuff in clearance like the other day I didn't pick it up because I already have enough instruments
at home they had Guitar Hero the new one with a guitar it's like 20 bucks oh shoot yeah we're
at Target like yeah the Rancho shit I might go buy that it wasn't there last time I went there
last but last time I went there they had well one of the games I did pick up this week so I haven't
played it yet but I've been getting more VR games so I picked up they had a couple things digitally
on sale so I got the PlayStation worlds game because that was selling to like 10 bucks and
then I also picked up oh god what was the other one there's another VR game that drive club VR
because I think that was also down like 10 bucks so I picked those up and digitally and then Eagle
flight which is that weird Ubisoft game they had it for $12 so I picked that up as well because it
looks fun so they had that I was mainly looking for because they're closing at one time the Lego
dimension stuff and I wanted to get some of those sets cuz they're down like five I still need to
get that Midway set before it disappears I really want yeah it's gonna be hard to find I mean I saw
it in a store not that long ago I did see the Toys R Us and they had him at the Targon sunrise
if I remember correctly okay I because I look at that stuff every time I go in how can you not
well yeah cuz I'm like because they've been marking them down like occasionally I'll see
deals it like $1 I'm like oh damn I want that so there's like a routine so you know our pal
Shane my pal Shane that I hang out with all the time who hosts a show here on the network
called Ranger pride they're on a little hiatus right now but they'll be back Shane likes to go
and if you listen to Ranger pride you know he likes to go looking for all the toys right so
sometimes he'll con me into going on a toy hunt because it'll be like well let's just go on a toy
hunt that will do lunch or something like that and so you know we'll have ourselves a fun Saturday
morning so we have a routine like we go to Toys R Us and we look for the Power Ranger thing he's
looking for and then we always go we look at amiibos we look at video games like we just have a like
a habit of all the sections in the store any stuff mark down I almost picked up they had some of the
Finding Dory stuff there and I was like man my kids would really like that but we have too many
of those figures they don't play the game and my wife would be pissed if I pick more these up so
I'm like yeah I'm just gonna not yeah they don't play it you send them to Bobby Blackwell if he
plays but I knew they had a Doris if I hadn't seen it in any of the stores and now they have it there
you go yeah go ahead and pick it up anything else for your gaming week um just the usual clicker
game although I'm starting to get very tired of it so I don't know how long we continue with that
I mean I Pokemon go maybe a thing they'll be start up again for a little bit but yeah I'm just like
it's gotten to be more of like a chore and it's just there's like no point to it anymore I just
kind of yeah why am I wasting my time with this well I'll lead it to my gaming week that and say
I've been playing a little Pokemon go uh I don't I don't I don't view it as a chore like well I will
say this like you know the one thing I want to do in Pokemon go and I think you kind of have to
choose like what are your goals and Pokemon go do you want to raid gyms all the day and control
the gyms do you want you know to collect all the Pokemon and level them all up or what so I really
want to fill out the pokey decks right so right now in Pokemon go this month is where the anti
raids are happening which one of the legendaries but like it is like the raiding activity has died
off significantly from when it was the legendary birds and from when it was Raikou last month now
I'm not saying Pokemon go is dead but Pokemon go is certainly not what it was over the summer or
even just taking a nap it's it's yeah siesta a little siesta I'd say it's probably like dropping
off faster as it goes long instead of it kind of taking a while to kind of dip it's going a lot
faster so I was legit worried like I was not gonna find a group to get an Entei and I have a little
chat we use a chat program called group me for some of the local people here and so usually when
raids happen and last month like raids every day every night this month once in a while but like
they don't happen every day so and I'm not available every day so I have to be careful
sometimes so we tried to go do something a couple nights ago I didn't get Entei on the first go but
today we went to a local park over here that has two gyms and by coincidence they both had Entei
at the same time and so we got to do two Entei raids back-to-back and I did catch an Entei at
one of those raids so and it was like this big sigh of relief like whew I'm not gonna miss it
because I was so next month my lesson is learned I need to be out there day one which is what that's
gonna be like Halloween to go out and get the ice dog or I can't remember the name as something
but the ice dog I have to go up make sure I go out get day one because that's gonna be the easiest
day to do it so I was get a little worried but you know I still Pokemon go is still a good way
to gamify my walks like Fitbit kind of gamifies a lot with walking Pokemon go kind of does that
because it's like oh I can hatch eggs and I still you know I could still make some good Dragonite
you know use candy for things there's things and eggs you get a lot of stardust from that so it's
kind of like you know I'm not like obsessed with Pokemon go but it's a nice little distraction and
incentivizer for me to make sure I get up on my lunch and actually walk outside the building as
opposed to sit and play on the internet the entire lunch in my office and then whoops lunch is over
and I got to get back to work you know it's a nice way to make sure like I get out and get moving so
yeah so I have some I have been playing a little bit of Pokemon go guys you know in chat over at
live.vog network.com says it's in trouble because players know the Russians used it to hack our
election I how would they've used it to hack our election I don't remember what the story was but
I think it was something about people naming their Pokemon to certain controversial terms and putting
them in gyms and then taking pictures of it and spreading it on Facebook but I don't want to get
heavy into politics but the reality is it ain't just Pokemon go they were messing with to try to
influence the election we'll leave it at that I think I think that almost speaks to I know I
based my election choices but on the names of Pokemon and gyms I I think that just speaks
volumes about what a cultural phenomenon Pokemon go even was I mean think about it how many video
games since Polybus have you heard about a government conspiracy to change our way of life
like it's been a while so anyway yeah that's what it was thank you Bobby Bobby's kind of echoing
what I'm saying they didn't hack the app itself but it was an ad campaign with people naming their
pokemons anyway other comments on Pokemon go and chat SSG100Matt says we had 30 people rating for
an Entei at a random mall in Connecticut we were shocked because this mall was in the middle of
nowhere okay so maybe my 30 people in Connecticut that's not bad so maybe my experience is
different let's hit Bobby Black Wolf jokes about Pokemon go it fainted and it will never wake back
up ever it didn't faint it might be down to like five hit points been faint other games I've been
playing besides Pokemon go so I did a live stream of cuphead after the show last week and that was
a lot of fun like it is it is a I love the art style the music the way the game feels like it's
a solid platformer like I Jamie if you and Dan checked out Cuphead cuz I really feel like you
guys haven't had a chance yet okay yeah I definitely at some point check it out I mean it's
it's infuriatingly hard but like just I think you're gonna love like the art style of the
presentation following it for a long time oh yeah it's been chatting with the developers from time
to time on Twitter oh fun yeah yeah no um it's been on my list for a while it's just right now
I'm still working on the convention guide for derpy con so that's been taking my spare time there
you go I'll check on you with your full game a week in a minute let me let me finish up real quick
so also uh let's see dungeon buster says you did great at cuphead Rob yeah thank you I did I I beat
the tutorial so I got through that and I beat a few of the bosses on stream so um you know I I am
allowed to continue to do a video game podcast I suppose after that but all that crap I'm saying
that very tongue-in-cheek here's the funny thing about that you guys might get a kick out of this
so I decided because I felt like that was a really good stream because I actually had a generous
twitch person put like 86 viewers on me at one point so like I had quite a few people watching
at the end so I feel like all that energy and a lot of people watching made it a really fun stream
so I was like you know I don't do this with a lot of my streams I'm gonna put this one on YouTube so
if you want to see the archive of the stream you can see it either on my twitch or you can see it
on YouTube you know I waited 24 hours you have to do and then I put it up here's the hilarious part
so within two days my YouTube has like 10 views because I wrote a tweet about it and 10 people
clicked it and it gets flagged for copyright infringement by this company and I don't even
remember the name of it was something like EBC maker EBCD makers only that was like what is I
tried to google it I couldn't find anything I searched for tweets about it and there was only
one other guy going these guys flagged my video and I was about to go off on YouTube and this whole
cuz here here we go this whole thing where the people that make the videos just fucking get
screwed by these people that come in and have no right to do so but I was like all right before
you go off check what the rules on Cuphead are so I was doing my research and sure enough studio
MDHR or whoever sorry if I messed up the acronym but the studio that made Cuphead has a page that
very specifically says yes stream the games put the games on YouTube make money off them we don't
care get it out there you know so I I filed an appeal I said oh hell no I filed an appeal I linked
to that YouTube and so forth I will give YouTube credit when I sent my appeal they re-enabled the
video right away and I think that's a change from what it was before so and it said the claimants
have 30 days to respond and after a day the claim disappeared I never got an email saying that oh
they accepted it or whatever but I fought the law and I won and it feels good early so far knock
on wood but so far it's completely the claim is completely disappeared from my account so yeah
take that I think if you counter then they the next step is they have to file an actual lawsuit
or something yeah they don't own it so like but it's like they're not going to who the hell is
this company and I'm like you know if the if the Cuphead studio had a page that said do not post
the videos and monetize them I would have said well I don't have I don't have monetization anyway
because my YouTube channel has 9960 views so I'm like just shy of 10,000 I had it at one point but
I got turned away or whatever when they when they put the 10,000 view because I don't I don't
honestly I don't use YouTube a lot I've really been trying to focus my efforts on Twitch but
when I was at Dragon Con and on the podcast track I took some of the advice I believe it or not even
though I didn't take all the advice like start a patreon to heart I took some of the advice like
get your stuff out there on as many porn for platforms as possible I took that stuff to heart
so I was like you know what I do need to be pushing more of my twitch stuff to YouTube so I
was trying to do that and it was just funny that like this first video gets flagged and I have to
fight it and all that stuff but the experience could have been worse I guess I'll leave it that
way but if the studio had a page that said don't do it then I would have said okay my bad and I
would have taken it down and just been like okay I won't do that again so but that was a lot of
indie game studios don't give a shit yeah uh SSG100Matt in chat says yeah these BS video
flaggers I have a friend who does YouTube full-time and he has to deal with this nonsense he often
often has to request a manual review on these claims has anybody ever tried to like class
action lawsuit these third-party companies surely that happened at some point with the bigger
streamers I'm not gonna do that shit but people like sort of mark plier might be able to so it's
not not really but like you know there is that whole case against Alex Mauer right now which is
kind of wrapping up oh yeah thing so basically she had a certain chance to respond and she
responded late and so now they are filing a motion the strike and all this stuff so it's
almost over so when it does end up if if they do win it end up winning which they probably will
then that does open it up to the fact that she was filing false DMCAs and they could file a
class-action lawsuit against her for lost revenue because she did two hundreds that could be an
interesting precedent too so be it'll be interesting to see what happens yeah because I mean it seems
like anybody can file a claim and you don't have to be the copyright owner of it and you know it's
gonna just fuck everybody over and what you you mean you could even just say low oh yeah and then
you know you can some people do this they'll wait the 30 days that they have to appeal and so before
they used to not get any revenue for that I think now it goes into an escrow account or something
like that and then at the very last second they'll just say okay we're dropping our claim but that
was 30 days you weren't getting revenue and by that time you know who's gonna see your video
right so all right anyway um what else in my game away let me quickly say Final Fantasy 14 got a
patch on Tuesday so I hadn't played in like a month but that was enough to get me to check it
out again so I've been playing that a little bit and I'm gonna do a live stream tonight after the
show Stardew Valley on Nintendo switch I'm gonna play that for the first time I played it on PC
before but I honestly don't remember it at all it was like over a year ago and I played once and I
don't remember it at all so I'm gonna but my Twitter has been lighting up with people who
love Stardew Valley on the switch and I was like it's only 10 bucks because I already had leftover
credit on my accounts I was like you know what let's do it I'm gonna buy Stardew Valley on switch
so we're gonna play that after the show tonight so I think that's it for my game a week I've
talked enough so Jamie we'll circle back to you sorry we missed you the first go-around but how
was your game a week I'm playing Ragnarok online again officially on a free server did that whole
little pouring clicky-click game make you want to go back yeah um it's like a quick leveling server
so I'm already like rebirth level you know high thief or something oh sorry I'm eating a bagel
um it got stuck in my teeth um I'm also of source still playing idle pouring and Pokemon go and that
other oh yeah me Tomo um I put danganronpa v3 on hold because like I said I still want to stream it
but it's gonna have to wait until I've got the con guy done which you know my deadline I thought
was this weekend thankfully it's not but it's busy there you go that and other personal things
going on I've still been busy too because I mentioned this last week I've still been busy
with that Big Brother thing I talked about I wasn't first voted out so that's a victory for
me because I thought I would be but it's still going so it's it's taking maybe 90% of the time
it was so I have a little more time to do stuff but not a lot because just like my Skype is
constantly going crazy from that game but it's it's fun and I'm meeting new people so yeah anyway
that's it that's it for your gaming week that's it for all our gaming weeks I already talked about
housekeeping and by the way Jamie no show veterans day weekend I dropped that on us for the first
time Alan and I are going to Seattle have fun yeah thank you we will we I earned it dammit this
has been a shit year I I am ready to fucking go to Seattle and have fun all right let's get to some
gaming news Loki start us off would you yes so Nintendo is looking to get more adult games on
the switch so that's kind of a change because you know before they used to kind of not put those
types of games on there because the system is more of a family-friendly system but they seem
to be kind of moving in the adult theme area as well so for example you know they're saying that
games like doom you know Knights of Azure to brighter the new moon shinobi rifle centering
kangaroo coming to switch of course is a little bit of a change because those are definitely more
an adult-oriented game they're saying that you know I guess the creator of Galvin 2 actually was
surprised by Nintendo's reaction to their pitch of releasing that game on their platform he said I
thought it wouldn't be possible to release such a game for the switch but surprisingly Nintendo gave
me positive feedback so it seems like they're a little bit more open to those types of games on
there which is good because I mean honestly you have to catering to children's fine because
there's plenty games to do that but you got to cater to as many people as possible so why not
I mean I think already they're kind of taking steps in the right direction especially with this
you know cross play and stuff all they need to do now is just get rid of those fucking friend codes
and then you'll be on board I mean but it seems to move it in the right direction so more blood
and more guts on the switch titties more titties on the switchy how about how about how about some
dongs to make it fair all right sure thank you Loki I appreciate the blessing with that HD rumble
you know you feel the dong in your hand there's a dick in my hand I don't think they vibrate unless
you have like additives no accessory oh oh I see I see well you know there's a lot of it it's not
supposed to vibrate it's like you know how they have the whole like you know ice cubes in the
controller demo type of thing so you won't really vibrate it but like you would you shake the
controller back and forth and you'd feel the weights of it flopping about you know flopping
all right anyway well what we'll see maybe more adult games coming switch what about night trap
because they've been re-released not everywhere night trap gonna come out on hot garbage so I
don't know if we need that game I just feel like whatever it's adult games always comes back to
night trap like the the og adult game what was that what was that game that was at e3 a decade
ago feel three or feel three that's it feel three for the we offer the switch why not put like five
nights at Freddy's I'm surprised that isn't on there already I'm kind of surprised too maybe
it's maybe it's not as easy as you'd think too because he made it in some type of game maker
program so maybe it's not as easy to port it over to the switch hmm but maybe it's inevitable at
some point I also got a feel five nights at Freddy's might be a little bit past its prime
probably but then again I mean fucking just in the past couple weeks we've had axiom verge and
stardew valley and these games that have come out on plenty of other consoles even years ago and I
feel like there's a lot of Nintendo fans that are kind of living these things for the first time
well I mean you like I think with the Wii U was and they didn't really focus too much on Indies
but like any scene that be able to have more visibility because there wasn't so much on the
platform and I think that's kind of the same scenario with switches there's not a ton of
things on the platform right now so you can get that visibility for your game and actually if
there's you know those games coming out few and far between you definitely have more people looking
at your game no that's a very good point I think Nintendo's really leveraged their e-shop a lot
better this time and you can't say there aren't a lot of games on the switch right now I mean
granted they're not a lot of triple-a titles but there's a lot of you know you can download
digitally except not all the same time because your switch only has 32 gigs of storage that was
really technically you can expand it technically didn't have to technically all right I shouldn't
have to do that all right let's talk about Microsoft a little bit Microsoft you know the
Kinect has kind of had one foot out the door for a little while now and you may not have realized
but when the Xbox one s launched last year which is the smaller Xbox one which is the only Xbox
one regular there's gonna be now there used to be a little adapter that you could get with it for
free that would allow the Kinect to be used on this console it's basically a USB to connect
adapter okay but that promotion you may not realize that ended in March this year so you
can no longer get that adapter for free all those connect games are not gonna be able to play well
just to be clear and the reason why I bring this up Xbox one X will not have a similar offer and
that was confirmed by Aaron Greenberg executive for Xbox on a Twitter I can't believe we're
confirming news via Twitter but here we are in 2017 Aaron Greenberg on Twitter said we provided
free adapters for a good part of last year following the Xbox one s launch but that program
has ended so well I don't think they're selling the Kinect anymore well to be fair is it completely
discontinued it's probably harder to find you probably don't get a lot of shelter things that
there but I bet you could probably go on Amazon and get one still right but a lot of it's gonna
be used yeah I don't think they're selling anymore cuz I can't honestly name you I would
assume just dance supports it but I think that is still assumption that's still an assumption
maybe just like that they support the move controller but I don't think you need the
move controller for anything right all phones but yeah I don't think there's not any games I can
think of they're coming out it's like man that's a Kinect game like even those well okay now I take
that back there is a couple games do support it but those are those re-released Kinect adventure
games remember that they had like the Disney Adventure one that are coming out with controller
support now but they still support Kinect because it's you know like an HD remaster okay that's like
a very who gives a shit no one's looking for that I do want to point out Rama and chat says Microsoft
is still selling the Kinect Brad actually provides the link to Amazon so there you go those yeah they
I'm sure they got inventory that they want to move not an inventory you see in stores though so even
though we're not gonna bury the Kinect yet the Kinect is certainly it's you know with the Xbox
1x they're not focusing on Kinect the message is 4k fucking beautiful gaming that's the message on
Xbox one X that is not Kinect anymore so you know they're gonna keep pushing the beautifulness of
games like four is a seven and crackdown three when it comes out next year and the other stuff
that has the Xbox one I've already forgotten about crackdown three whoops yeah so I'd be
curious to see how that little console does this holiday for Microsoft's gonna be very very
interesting I think it do well I would assume either I just kind of worry that this well I
don't know like definitely the Xbox one X has its audience I don't think it's gonna move the number
of units that the switch does this holiday but does it need to maybe not you know the Xbox one
X is a high-end piece of hardware I don't know how to move high-end types of numbers I'm sure
it where the targets it'll do better one there's more 4k content out there because I think right
now it's still very early it's kind of like where 3d TVs were for a while where they're really
pushing that it was almost too early I mean the 4k TVs have been out for a while now it's just like
is it necessary like do you really feel like that you need to upgrade or anything I don't feel like
that yet I mean it would be a nice to have but it's not something I'm looking to go out and do
right away until my TV dies and then yeah I'll get 4k TV then that's kind of where I'm at and
remember I'd mentioned this after e3 it's like I'm excited to do 4k gaming on PC but even that
I think you know the money that I probably would have spent on a 4k graphics card I just bought a
vacation with so yeah that's probably gonna wait till 2018 or just take for guys okay oh don't do
4k do like 1440p or something like that and just drop it down a little bit and then you have like
killer frame rate to go with it oh yeah enhanced everything that's kind of yeah like even or I can
play like 2k still runs pretty decent on the car to yeah so that's probably what I'll end up doing
so yeah and I can still do 4k movies and all that stuff just fine that I don't runs great on my my
rig so you know I still I saw all that but yeah I'm probably just gonna wait a little bit on the
gaming portion of that but um I I will say this the Xbox has now become my living room console
because my PlayStation 4 got moved into the office so I could do more streaming with it I still play
games on PlayStation 4 but I do my Hulu and CBS for Star Trek and all this I do all that on Xbox
now I don't do it on PlayStation so just kind of an interesting shift I've been kind of having to
use my Xbox more for that media stuff so I can watch on the TV in the living room and the
experience has been fine so you know it's pretty easy to grab new apps and I do like I will give
it is much easier if I were to say download episodes of RuPaul's Drag Race which I would
never do but let's say I did like it's very easy to put them on a USB Drive and then plug that into
my Xbox one and just play them right off that so which doesn't really work as easy on PlayStation
4 it's too bad I mean I get why they do it but it's too bad that they don't like partner like
and this is not even necessarily any you know specific console but one thing I love on my
Android TV box is the whole Google cast stuff because they have apps that they build specifically
for that and I love the native apps but half of the native apps aren't available you just have to
cast over to it but it works fantastic so I'm a little too well actually because my kids tablets
it somehow knows that my TV things on our network and if they hit the button it casts to the TV and
there's no way to block that so it's like you'll be watching TV also and some shitty YouTube
children's things on there my god fucking damn it yeah turn that shit off anyway going to something
else about Xbox and Microsoft to remember the original og Xbox the Xbox first Xbox VCR Xbox
Uno those games are still gonna be backwards compatible at some point remember crimson skies
hello anyway it is still coming Xbox head Phil Spencer reaffirmed in an interview with game
spot it is happening saying we're close we're really close we're so close keep going anyway
it should gene we should watch by the end of the year so by the end of the year you should be able
to play things like crimson skies and fusion frenzy on your Xbox they're just using frenzy
just blow a big bunch of games all over you all at once you know what props to them for actually
working on backwards compatibility yeah it's like had I known this now when I was shopping for
consoles I probably have an Xbox one instead of a PlayStation 4 hmm and it's just disappointing to
see how little movement there is on that front with PlayStation it's just they want me to do
their streaming service and no I don't want to do your streaming service Sony's getting a little
cocky and it might you know it's gonna be interesting are we gonna go in the next in the
next gym are we gonna flip back again it's gonna be well the reason why I'm saying Sony's getting
cocky just people understand this whole of cross-platform gaming again I don't think it made
our show tonight but there was another game out there I was reading a story about that they came
out said well we'll be cross-platform on switch Xbox one and PC because Sony won't let us do it
and I just Sony can only sit on top of that throne so long you know it's it's people remember that
kind of crap mm-hmm mm-hmm all right let's let's hope they correct make a corrective course soon
anyway let's move on we've been talking a lot of the first two stories so let's go over to Dark
Sakura with what she has to report oh well I don't know if it's gonna be bad or good it could be
good it could be like I said bad but humble bundle has been acquired by IGN as in you know
the the gaming news slash strategy stuff you know website but anyway they said though that they
chose IGN because they quote understand their vision that they think that they'll be able to
help hunt a humble bundle continue with their quest for charity and good works through gaming
so I hope I hope it stays good I hope hope hope they don't get screwed over in this so yay to
register participation for this week's episode of orange island radio at vog network calm use
the passphrase door as long as the charity support stays I think there will still be a lot of fans of
humble bundle and I think you know again one thing that's gonna have to stay and I don't know how IGN
feels about this but the ability to choose you know if you're gonna give money to charity or
give money to developers or give money as a tip to the humble bundle itself to keep it going I
know the default is usually like a third a third a third but you know if you want you can slide the
bar and you just give all the money to charity and you know some people some people play with that
maybe they'll give you know 40% to charity 40% to the developers and 20% to humble bundle you know
sometimes people like to play with those numbers so I think as long as that stays there people
won't get upset but like if the tip becomes required or something like that then that's
where people are gonna start to abandon that chip real quick my only thing with humble bundle is
that there's so many of them now so frequently that it's hard to keep tabs when good ones are
out I wish it integrated more with steam so I could see which games I already own because there's
like several humble bundles where like I just don't buy them because I have like half the games on
them I mean it's nice to support charities and stuff but I don't need to buy stuff I already have
act-deft in chat says I'm not really okay with IGN buying humble but at the same time I do
think IGN can help them become bigger s2100 Matt says as long as IGN lets humble continue to do
their thing I am okay but I'm extremely cautious about this stop he says I'm sure it was it's
gonna change does anyone to remember the stories from a year or so ago when they were saying they
couldn't afford to pay humble staff Bobby Blackwell says humble bundles lost their uniqueness they
were better when they were just an event now it's just yet another digital storefront and that's
boring you know what I hate to fucking bring this up but I'm gonna I'm gonna fucking bring it up
it's exactly what's gonna happen to she's one sauce in the winner it's exactly what's gonna
happen everybody's losing their fucking mind they're gonna try they're like wow that's not
really good this stuff was nasty anyway and then when it comes out and it's it because now
McDonald's fucking because of everything's happened they've come back to new a corner
fucking publicity got the factory going overtime right now so that come November December they're
gonna have that shit everywhere and then people are gonna try it they're gonna be like no wonder
they got rid of this shit the first time it's like Crystal Pepsi kinda why can't they bring
back Josta if they're gonna bring back something surge bring back surge I know they sell it on
Amazon but why can't it be in store I bet you surge sucks too you know what is seriously
delicious search was fucking awesome but they changed the recipe so it's not quite the same
anymore but I still want I I have found I gotta work something from Amazon recent pretty soon so
I'm gonna get surge with that I have found something that tastes like Josta by the way
and they sell it at the Russian grocery store out in Citrus Heights it's like some guarana drink but
it tastes just like Josta just saying noted that's just like I know I saw catch-up still was my stuff
okay I saw ketchup chips for sale the other day ketchup is disgusting I had a very Canadian
moment no why not I did order mushroom ketchup really you put it's an 18th century thing you
put ketchup on your french fries mayonnaise french fries are a potato fuck that french fries you put
ketchup on french fries or not your cheese why can't you put ketchup on potato chips it's they're
both potatoes ketchup is disgusting ketchup is fine I almost feel about ketchup the way you do
about mayonnaise potato chips in that case fine don't eat them but see you don't really put ketchup
on potato chips I'm fine if you want to dip that shit you know that's fine or even the ranch or
something that'd be fine but like I don't know if you should put on the chips or make your chips
clearly with people's fucking obsession with ranch I don't know I think ranch is nasty in
most scenario it's all about balsamic vinegar I knew a guy in college that bought ranch by the
gallon and he would have the gallon fucking mug in the the refrigerator and would put it on
everything when you dip it in the ranch like the internet like a soda Alan is here to lend us some
witful insight now that he heard this the worst application of ranch dressing I've ever seen in
my life was back in 95 96 senior year of high school when the cafeteria had the big Costco
pumps of ketchup mustard and ranch and people would drizzle ranch on like they're like this
shitty cardboard flat pizza that was like it was like it basically wasn't even cheese it was like
it was like it was like the frosting top of a zinger doing Twinkie or just peeled it off so
that so they would put ranch on that but the worst were the girls who got a Nissan cup of ramen put
in the hot water and then put in four pumps of ranch so water down ranch in their cup of noodles
that happened that's a travesty that happened 20 years ago 22 years ago and a tragedy so worse
I've never looked at ranch the same way again I do like Hidden Valley Ranch you know if we're
gonna get brand specific because oh no no more ranch discussion sorry Ken's brand is the best
cool ranch and it's on a Dorito I want nothing Doritos are fucking gross all right and you can
use them as fire kindling it's your story all right no Alan was just borrowing my mic for a
minute artitsu we only have three in studio right now seriously yes Szechuan sauce is gonna be a
fucking joke and I don't know why people were flipping did you hear someone traded one of those
packets for a car I apologize for the listener to the listeners for bringing up Szechuan sauce
on olr I was trying to make a point and look what fucking happened I will learn my lesson
for next time and do better oh we go on tangents like that's this is the first time that's ever
happened our 10 into the show Loki next story so you know as I mentioned I may be getting back
into Pokemon soon that's because the new update has been data mined and we've found pictures for
the Halloween event that's right there's gonna be some Halloween event which is not unexpected but
along with that there's also trophy listings and badges for the third gen of Pokemon so third gen
of Pokemon I'm probably gonna be here within two weeks or so it could be a limited start
remember when Gen 2 released it was just the babies for the first yeah I don't think it's
but I'm just saying don't be shocked if it's the ghost Pokemon only I do need some more
ghost Pokemon though I'm pretty deficient in the ghost Pokemon area I don't think there's any like
big heavy-hitting ghost Pokemon right now like maybe Gengar but you have to really power it up
you know yeah so but yeah they're saying though there's a new loading screen and it has I guess
teasing third generation Pokemon as well so they've got that's the most damning and yet
dustclops, shuppet, bannet, dust skull and sableye so and then of course Gengar is on there but those
might be the only Pokemon I'm just warning because I seem to remember when Gen 2 launched we got a
loading screen with Pichu and Igglybuff and the babies that they let out originally so I'm just
saying be prepared y'all that those may be the only Gen 3 Pokemon we get at first and then by
December or whatever or no probably earlier than that by November Thanksgiving or something we'll
have all the rest of Gen 3 but I'm glad we didn't have to wait an entire year it was only about eight
months well can we fast forward to Alola already well that's what I'm saying it's like I think that
the lull is going it's it's not dragging out as long anymore it's like people are kind of getting
over it really fast and so they're gonna have to get those updates a lot faster yeah well I would
say Niantic is still it's raining money over there because I'm sure with the raids you know there's
still enough people doing them that they're making money you know right it's not kid ourselves but
isn't it nice to make a lot of money and we still have Mewtwo raids to really I mean I know they've
done a couple but they didn't really launch them big so I mean I still don't have Mewtwo which
actually I'm kind of pressed about that because a lot of people I know do have them so I kind of
like that to come back so I can try to catch another so we'll see though maybe that's something
it's gonna launch around gen 3 I don't know so as 100 Matt thinks in our chat I think there will
be more costumed Pokemon they did come out with this update about not being able to transfer
costume Pokemon without an extra screen I thought that was always because we had that bug a month or
two ago where the Pikachu's weren't showing their hats right yeah and so people like may accidentally
throw them away but now you can't do that so that's great I'm so happy they put that in actually
and then one other thing that they're doing also a little bit before this whole update that's
allegedly this was happen this is Pokemon go photography contest so using the app you can
actually take pictures of course of Pokemon and with the AR camera so they're basically having
you kind of try to get the best spot or shot that you can and then share it on Instagram and tag it
Pokemon go contest so you have until the 25th of October to do that and I guess they haven't really
announced with the prize oh here we go so if you do win and this is used US residents only
unfortunately the winner gets a bag containing a poster autographed by the team a pair of wireless
Bluetooth earbuds and go plus so it's kind of alright can I submit old photos because I have
a picture of a Paris on the grill at Benihana that I still think is funny probably I mean that
would be fun and fine I might try that definitely don't do anything you would see in the Pokemon go
our Pokemon go gone wild community oh god that is unfortunately a thing oh god is it a tumbler
it's a reddit subreddit I'm sure it's a tumbler thing as well but yes if you want to see you know
Pikachu sitting on dudes dick there you go camera of course people are gonna take pictures or sticks
with it okay wait you said it's a reddit it's a reddit yes I think it's like Pokemon go gw or
gone wild Pokemon gone wild maybe I don't know like Pokemon go gone a while or something what's
the most horrible horrible thing you've seen on there I don't know it's just it's pokey gone
why oh it's I went to the sub and it says nothing there they flushed it I don't know do I need to
log in I doubt it there I search this now let chatter I know what so I know somebody out there
knows it y'all need better hobbies it's a Pokemon go gone wild I think Pokemon go NSFW that's what
it was okay thank SSG 100 Matt news it the award for biggest perv goes to because it's it got a
camera and so people are gonna do that I'm looking at a picture of an Eevee next to a naked lady why
why not and then here's a picture of a horsey sitting on a guy's Wang that's I'm glad I I'm
glad I logged into the internet today if it exists it can be porned if it's got a camera
you're gonna get porn out of it SSG 100 Matt says wow throwing me under the bus just because I Google
it faster than you I just I expect Tiger Claw to have the best Google food skills sorry SSG
100 Matt I guess there's some things even Tiger Claw won't Google and I don't blame you for that
I don't blame you for that there's a lot of money person with morals in this room yes no you don't
have them either come on girl I have morals I'm just not interested in that kind of garbage come
on no Gus and chat says Rob's gonna be up all night yeah crying all right hey you must be this
tall to enter all right I do I just doesn't you know morals have nothing to do with the dirty
mind all right moving on let's talk about him fortnight because I have if you're gonna be up
to fort all night over on a gadget they had a story that caught my eye is talking about a
fortnight lawsuit because I know a lot of people are playing the fortnight battle royale online
well apparently epic games has filed a civil lawsuit against two people they say are cheating
while playing online and they're doing it through a website called addicted cheats which apparently
this website it's subscription based and you can on this website use their services to hunt down
and kill twitch streamers while they played live what a bunch of dicks what a dick bag thing to do
yeah people like doing it but that's usually they know it's usually they have a delay on it
and a lot of twitch streamers can put like a 30-second delay so it doesn't matter interesting
but so anyway I what epic games excuse you have a cease pardon me blessing I'm allergic to bullshit
are rated stuff with epic game says in the suit that individuals had to dive in and modify
fortnight's source code and able to do this and this violates the EU LA and the DMCA that of
course being the License Agreement and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act so anyway epic is not
suing the site to get it off the internet it's suing the two individuals for copyright infringement
that can carry a penalty up to a hundred and fifty thousand dollars these two defendants are
technical support for addicted cheats calm so it looks like epic games may be trying to make an
example out of them in the complaint one defendant was banned from fortnight nine times continue to
make new accounts to continue playing accused of using specifically the addicted cheat site to hunt
down popular players while live streaming which I guess is a whole prat is a whole part of the dark
web no dark web thing they just do that the dark web yeah called a stream sniping and that is
forbidden in the code of contact for player unknowns battlegrounds which is why the guy
got banned nine times so anyway that would be interesting also addicted cheats has taken that
cheat offline saying it's closed for a legal issue there you go come on no Gus and chat says addicted
cheats is that like an Ashley Madison site something let's see stop Ian chat says how do
you even find individual streamers apparently this site would let you do it this site somehow
goes to the code and and will put like in their game people would normally do is they'd have a
stream on at the same time and they try to get in the same game as a streamer and they kind of
figure out based on where they see them right you know but then you have that's that's really easy
to do if you have like a short delay it's the whole look it's the whole rule of golden I you
don't fucking look at my screen to figure out where I am you keep your eyes on a damn screen
we're just like why waste your time doing that I mean I guess if you think if you're just trolling
I guess you might be easily amused by that kind of stuff but that just seems dumb yeah in case you
don't kind of brings up in chat saying can't someone just do that looking at someone's stream
yes but you can't really force your way into their game and I'm assuming this website kind
of facilitates you being able to make sure you get matched with them no I don't know I don't know
what that would do I don't know what it does because I would not use such a site this would
like show like say the usernames from like a longer distance away so they can see oh this is
where this person is and they it's like a wall hack almost where you can see the person through
the walls and so you can see where they are just goes make a beeline you know a lot about this
Loki well I've been playing games for a long time I have to all right moving on speaking of she who
has been playing games for a long time dark soccer we have for us I have some stuff about blizzard
sue in the pants off people because it's not you know the the 2000 teens without having you know
one company sue another and in this case blizzard is suing a and actually its partner oversees
neaties I think it's called net ease are suing developers of a game called heroes of warfare
the developers for three nine nine and they are they put out what they called the first MOBA on
iOS or Android they have you know stylized characters with checkpoints on maps that's
similar layouts like in overwatch and certain sound effects that sound like they've been pulled
directly from overwatch as well as a very similar UI so yeah Blizzard's like I know you didn't and
decided to lay the smack down financially on this Chinese company which I mean we get a lot
of clones I think you know trying to make money off of successful IPs but in this case I was
looking at some of the video of it it looks pretty pretty similar I mean the biggest difference is
platform but I don't know it's cute I mean you still make me it's probably still make me sick
you still can't put Super Mario Brothers on the iPhone unless you're Nintendo just because it's
a change in platform right yeah that whole type of thing yeah so so so they're getting their their
butt sued that's what you get come up with an original idea it'll be interesting to see how
it turns out because this practice is very common not just in China if you go on to you know
Apple Store or Google Play you're gonna find tons of clones of games Russian hackers gonna hack look
look at look when flappy bird came out some dude made a game called flappy vog it was such a ripoff
I'm just I'm teasing obviously I think a ton of people did and for one flappy vog speeds up as
you play which the original doesn't do so it does have a key difference but anyway all that stuff
aside I mean there's all these types of you know ripoffs but there's a big difference probably
between something like flappy bird and you know cuz again I'll you know kidding aside these other
knockoffs usually don't have a bird it's flappy something else you know a flappy podcast hosts
or whatever but you'd usually don't like copy art assets down to you know what's really
indistinguishable from other games I don't know those pipes sure did look like super mario bros
pipes that's true that's true oh how funny I never knew this Bobby Blackwell and chat says fun fact
I have never actually played flappy bird when I made flappy vog I just saw a video or two well I
take comfort in knowing I have probably one of the last phones left they can still play flappy bird
because I still not on iOS 11 you know what what never played flappy bird flappy bird happy bird
yeah never played flappy bird there's probably a reddit for that to do another story Loki so
we talked a little bit about loot boxes earlier and that's kind of one way developers and
publishers I think publishers are more involved with this piece out parts of games that would
normally be included in the full price of the game well another practice to do that as well is
pre-order bonuses that's right and so it's there was a specific online web advertisement from the
wonderful folks at the evil G that were advertising the pre-order bonus for Assassin's Creed origins
and so it kind of pissed off people a little bit because it basically showed this camel jump up in
the way it's like sorry the bonus mission is blocked unless you pre-order Assassin's Creed
origins because you know it's sort of playing or making fun of the whole pre-order culture but
being that this company is the one that kind of perpetuates that pre-order culture some people
weren't so sensitive to or weren't as happy to see that in an advertisement blatantly just saying
kind of like yeah we know what's wrong with fuck you guys pre-ordered this shit you know so that's
the thing apparently though I've from what I've seen is they've kind of taken this ad offline so
you can't really find it anymore but do you think there were some angry gamers around this probably
people get angry over a lot of things but it is kind of angry people on my yes yes on your
internet it's more real than you think I just but yeah it is kind of shitty the block a mission
behind a pre-ordered you know DLC thing that's why you wait for the game of the year edition
you know mm-hmm late gamers all right well hopefully you won't have to wait too long to
pick up this game because it's a blizzard game so you know they do good stuff as we were talking
about earlier apparently it's a new overwatch game that they may be working on this is huge
rumor and it's based off the fact that a vacancy on the blizzard jobs website says that they are
looking to expand overwatch with a generalist artist intern with knowledge and understanding
of overwatch to work on a unannounced project well shoot that could be anything because that
could be like a mobile type of game or something you know certainly will make a lot of sense if
blizzard wanted to use the overwatch IP on mobile somehow over watches the overwatch hmm let's see
it's also brought up that a while ago last year over on neo gaff somebody had found a listing for
a lead software engineer for a first-person title and Mike Morehame has confirmed in the past there
are teams working on new projects especially on mobile so it really could be anything I wouldn't
mind seeing a new overwatch game in a couple years but I really like the stuff like Junkenstein's
revenge and the PvE type of stuff especially when they did the uprising I think was an overwatch
uprising I like those types of events and the Junkenstein event by the way you know I know
we're joking about loot boxes but if you are an overwatch player don't forget to sign in and get
your Halloween loot box and do the Junkenstein uprising because it's not that hard and you get
a loot box from that too and in fact if you do it like nine times you can get like three more
loot boxes you can get a lot so yeah get your loot boxes then you don't have to buy them for
your cosmetic crap sure but yeah a new overwatch game I'd be into it but I see where blizzard
maybe wouldn't want to cannibalize the overwatch they have now so it would have to be something
maybe a little different but I think an overwatch PvE type of game would be awesome so we'll see
all right well let's travel back to a simpler time we're gonna travel back to a time when there
was no loot boxes there was just in fact if something was wrong with this cartridge like
if the boss was just missing on level 30 too fucking bad you dealt with it you didn't have
loot box you had a recall you had a hacked passwords yeah seriously so we're gonna terror
horror danger exclamation point and Justin Bailey our classic game of the week the dark
soccer is gonna step into the gaming vault find a game that she thinks hey you little brats give
me all the money you are gonna give the loot box people and go play this classic game instead
because it has no loot boxes and you can still play this game for like 60 hours oh yeah this
game is at least 60 hours of joy this is a great pick too it's one again here again how long have
we been doing this segment like almost 500 classic and this is a game that I started and never spent
much more time on I really really wish that I had and this is one of those games where I'm like how
is how have we not done this before right now so anyway this is the classic game is Terranigma
which in Japan was called a tenchi sozo which means the creation of heaven and earth it was
released in 1995 by enix with character designs done by a mangaka named Fujiwara Kamui Kamui sorry
it was released in English in the UK it was also released in German French and Spanish but never
released in North America which is a fucking travesty because this game I mean even a little
bit I played of it was really good you know it was just you know a little bit more of my own
gamer a DD and no SSJ 100 mat Julian is never picking halo because I'm only the my words the
final word the buck stops with me yeah then I kick it in the ass so basically the game has a
top-down perspective over the world it is an action-based real-time battle system to where
you do different techniques depending on with your if you're running jumping attacking or using
a combination of the actions but each attack will have different ways it can hurt different
enemies and so you get experience you know it increases your stats you get you know whatever
dead enemies leave behind like oh look the squirrel left me a compound bow that's interesting
where did the scroll keep the compound but you know bow up its ass compressed highly compressed
you also have you know spells and then different things that boost spells and the series that you
can click these things called magic rocks that you take them to a magic shop and have them
transformed into rings and summons so kind of like early materia system too if you think about it
but the thing that I always thought was cool about this game was the world it was built in is that
you have a fictional earth that is a hollow sphere so you have the people that live on the surface
and the people that live on the internal face of it so light side dark side and then two different
forces that rule them on the top it's the ability to evolve and exceed and on the dark side it's
decline so that creates two forces called God and devil which I guess people in America have
their you know head so far if their asses over anything with vague religious symbolism so
whatever the fuck and then like the last battle takes place in Antarctica so but it's it's a
really really neat game it has really great music and of course it was done by annex just a really
gorgeous game put out for the Super Famicom Super Nintendo and the company that that created it was
quintet who I'm sorry the development company was quintet who also designed Actraiser and Soul
Blazer you know illusion of Gaia an annex basically commissioned them a subcontractor and
wanted an action role-play game so that's how it happened so basically the the founder of quintet
wrote the script for the game and the scenarios had to be approved and it was just really a lot
that went into it they they had a little bit of I'd say early CG in it you know for designing
the graphics for the resurrection scenes and just pretty pretty crazed me crazy but it was never
published in North America because annex closed its US subsidiary before the localization was
finished so the English versions were used that were made for America were released in Europe and
Australian when Nintendo had it ready to go so it also had like a lot of merchandise that came out
with it including a guidebook a World Atlas and a novel and also another novelization of the game
full other art books in two manga based on it to full sorry a two volume manga that was based on
it and these have never been released outside of Japan although Club Nintendo did a 32 page comic
that came out in Germany the soundtrack of course has been released in 1995 and it had the first
six tracks were arranged versions the game music it sold pretty well Famicom sushi gave it a 30 out
of 40 so I mean even so that's not high enough not high enough no it isn't this game's great but
basically this is considered to be like one of the best games that never came out in the u.s.
it's really unfortunate that this whole series was not represented I mean I don't think these
games have a direct relation to each other between terror enigma and brain Lord and illusion a guy
and all that but they're still considered a creation trilogy yeah yeah that's a good way
of putting it a creation trilogy like like a Kevin Smith trilogy with clerks and more like like the
ice cream and blood ones what is the ice cream and bloods cream that they call it for like hot
fuzz Oh and Shaun of the Dead oh okay so the movies with that guy well no because they have
the same brand of ice cream in every yeah in all three of those movies yeah okay okay I got you I
got ya well they had they have big Kahuna burger and all of Tarantino's movies but it well in
Tarantino's already said his movies exist in the same universe yeah but anyway sorry I didn't mean
to cut you off but it's it's really tragic that these games don't exist on like or they're not
represented on the SNES classic at all you know like at least I would have killed to have I'd
rather distant Star Fox to me too me too well we'll just have to wait for S or now that it's
been hacked we'll just wait for SNES classic to electric boogaloo because you know it's only a
matter of time well now that it's already been hacked you know the other loading people are
loading their own games oh sure on them now that's it's official of course but I'm waiting for that
to be rock-solid before I touch mine well I'm not gonna mod mine because I have a never drive
although I want the one that will let you do the super FX games I think that'd be great but but
yeah this game totally worth it if you haven't played it in fact I'm kind of thinking I might
restart it just because it's been on my mind lately I've been trying to find a PAL copy of
it for a while haven't had any luck so we'll see all right there it is your classic game of the
week tear enigma on the Super Nintendo sadly never in the US but I'm sure lots of you have played it
anyway bastards wink before we go to our break Bobby black wolf with a technical question for
the goddess of the classic game of the week by black wolf wants to know is Starcraft 2 eligible
for classic game of the week because of its copyright date or does the 10-year timer start
when the Super Nintendo classic was released my guess would be she did a game that never came out
before as classic game of the week once because you know the lore and everything behind that so I
would think under those rules it would be eligible but you're not gonna pick a bad game just kidding
I'm kidding maybe you can do Stark we can we can we can revisit the thought of Starcraft 2
you mean Star Fox 2 Star Fox 2 we can we can revisit it because I think I would go by its
original inception like when it was actually finished why does this Starcraft by the way
Star Fox 2 it could it could end up there but people could have been playing it for longer
than 10 years but you're probably not gonna pick it we'll see never say never s2 and her Matt says
Star Fox 2 would happen sooner than a low to probably that is well none of the halo games are
gonna be in there so you may as well just forget it unless it's like a halo parody or knockoff like
the Atari halo yeah Atari halo maybe I'd do Atari halo you go but I wouldn't do like actual halo you
did and to be and people forget you did marathon at one point so close enough did I yeah you did
I'm almost positive you did on the Mac like years ago you know that the bungees first game oh yo
that sorry yeah I was like when did I marathon halo no no the game the game yeah I did marathon
because it was notable for spawning the garbage that is halo all right sorry it's not garbage
garbage actually serves a purpose Bobby Black Wolf says you have two more years halo 2600 was
released in 2009 we'll hold out hope that this show you know will be around that long no it
should there's no reason why it shouldn't but you know no all right we are gonna take a break though

is done is walking dead back I have that is that a thing I have no idea either so I don't think we
have anything we're competing against right now at least not until what two weeks from now when
I'm sure everybody's gonna be binging Stranger Things but that comes out on Friday so that's
so people should be done it's only like eight episodes right change it okay eight episodes
isn't a lot so you can you can binge that well no actually no it's more Nate episodes it was
quite a few last time it's like 12 or 13 no stranger things is only like six episodes the
first time it's more this time I think yeah so I don't know maybe maybe somebody in our chat knows
over at live dot vog network comm where Rama says walking dead is next week oh there you go and
let's see come on no Gus says Major League Baseball is happening right now well we always have to do
compete against sports that's that's always if it's not baseball it's football or it's basketball
there's always something on hockey it you know something's always gonna be on on Sunday night
okay Kaijuto says it was eight the first the first season was eight okay maybe it is ten this time
then you're right it is more this time okay let's move on though less TV more games rapid-fire news
starting with Loki this is kind of a weird place to play games but apparently there is a Russian
made van and truck company it called I guess gazelle and their gazelle next vans and trucks
have a Easter egg hidden in them in fact apparently in this vans dash you can play Tetris but how you
unlock it it's quite complicated so they have actually some basic instructions so first you
would turn the ignition on start the car activate the right turn signal for three blinks then you
would do two clicks of the trip odometer reset twice and says and then push the clutch five
times and then rev the engine to 2,000 rpm while turning on the left turn indicator this sounds a
lot like that Rainbow Road Tesla thing that Bobby did a video for at the fog network YouTube plug
plug but I mean seriously there was that YouTube that he did which showed that except that wasn't
really a game he actually showed that to me when I was in Atlanta and he was taking me there yeah
you can actually play it well you can turn the dial or whatever to move the pieces back and forth
and I think you click on the other dial to drop them so it's it's neat that you can do that why
you don't do that I don't know you must be incredibly bored you must really want to play
Tetris Tetris on it's like just like there's people that really want to play NES golf on the
switch these hacks and things happening yeah so apparently I mean it's a thing but it's just okay
that's kind of a head scratcher kind of like Sony making a movie based on the settlers of Catan I
can't imagine how that would be there really is no story in the settlers of Catan except for trading
and screwing people over by you know building the longest road and you know what they made a
movie off of clue it was one of the best things ever so why not then of course they made a movie
out of battleship and it was terrible they also made a movie out of you know I feel like I've
asked this before media and that was pretty terribly nice him in the movie right it was
did he get a chance to say you suck my battleship I don't cuz like oh if nobody in that movie
screams you sunk my battleship then that movie ain't worth shit now to be fair apparently this
is being okay so this is being driven though they've got basically a few people on board
so Dan Lin Gale Katz and Jonathan Eric will produce the film and I guess blaze Hemingway
will write the screenplay now some of those names may not sound familiar cats I guess they said he's
done 20 or films over the last 20 years including the line of fire in Air Force One I guess Lin has
had several movies as well including the new it that you've produced a Sherlock Holmes the Lego
movie the invention of lying also Terminator salvation gangsters go on death note so I don't
know I didn't mean it's even here miss with some of these Sony movies but I honestly don't know
where they would go with this because the it's if there's no plot to the game there's no backstory
it's just kind of this game so I don't know what the hell they would do with this other than okay
it's a medieval movie about settling its people people settling in the role of Catan at least the
Oregon Trail had a story behind it yeah like that would be alright but you could just do a movie
based on the actual Oregon Trail you have to remember that game was based on actual events
it's a little different settlers of Catan isn't based on anything so alright anyhow hey maybe a
movie worry or excuse me movie a movie that actually has a series that could get a movie
someday civilization all right I feel big cities why I don't know if I would be comfortable with
seeing Gandhi as this evil overlord I'm down that's true anyway civilization 6 which was a
game I was playing not that long ago actually they're getting some tweaks coming up the latest
update for the game has been announced by Firaxis and it's going to be kind of really tinkering the
religion aspect of the game is going to be getting the biggest overhaul religion is a victory
condition in the game right now but apparently it's one of the ones that's a little bit broken
it doesn't work quite as well so so new beliefs and religious units will be coming out with the
game there's also going to be two new pantheons in that new founder follower enhancer and worship
beliefs some new buildings and a new combat unit called the warrior monk which sounds like it might
tie into religions it sounds like they're really kind of inflating that part of the game this is
not DLC it's actually a patch that's going to be happening which is pretty cool I would have
thought maybe this would be the year well I guess they just sieve six was last year's game so maybe
next year we're gonna see something kind of what did they call it beyond Earth those is the Alpha
Centauri but I think they did beyond Earth on Civ fives engine so to be interesting to see if we
get the Civ 6 in space or maybe maybe something else Civ 4 got the colonization reimagining so
maybe they'll do something else with Civ 6's engine but that would probably be around next
year but this year you get some balancing issues and that'll be good also in news with this the
news this week I was going to bring up this story from our pals of Bahmani style calm but their
website appears to be down right now I guess too many people are all story oh so hopefully somebody
is also seen this but I know the article was about harmonics collecting the best rock band stories
out there for a 10-year celebration of rock band all in related news rock band is 10 years old
that's a game of the week yeah I know right that makes me feel really old but that is that's where
we're at rock band is that old and so they're collecting some good stories and memories there
probably to do some sort of retrospective that they're working on there so I'm sure we have a
few I know that I always thought that um loud event that you know seg was on the show promoting
a couple times was pretty cool and I did I got to do the hosting thing for one year that was a
lot of fun so hopefully that would be something that will make it into the memories book so all
right dark Sakura what do you have for rapid-fire news oh just some stuff in fact the thing that I
actually would rather like to have only for one game the this thing called the super retrocade
is going to be launching this year and it has a lot of Capcom and Data East stuff on it the game
I am most interested in is being able to play three wonders at home on my TV that would be
great but it comes has wired controllers you can do save states SD card support HDMI AV out and 90
titles so that'll be cool if the emulation is good yeah 90s good well apparently their last console
emulation one so good so they got to work on that and then something else too and I've actually seen
some of this being played is a Jersey Jack is releasing a new Pirates of the Caribbean pinball
that blows the other one out of the water haha pirate joke are I get it but it has like this
like whirlpool and you can shoot cannons back and forth between two ships in this little triple
spinner in the middle that really makes for some unpredictable ball control it's it's really nice
it is really good and if you don't know Jersey Jack did the tables that they did did was the
Hobbit and Wizard of Oz and the third one I can't remember what it was but they did it so this is
their fourth table I know very cool all right yeah they're like a they're like a newer pinball
company right they have some stuff at the coin op here locally I feel like one or two of those
tables has shown up there so I could be wrong I don't know all right let's travel around the
world and check out some games that are coming out in a store near you this week what's on shelves

myth that's gonna be out on 3ds Gran Turismo sport on PlayStation VR Oh Rogue Trooper Redux

I was looking forward to however I don't see that on the PlayStation Store so I don't think that's

they are still some releases worth looking forward to on the October the 19th Kyo A Toshi comes out
in Japan Gran Turismo support Gran Turismo support Gran Turismo sport gets its regular and

it's a daki comes out this week I'm not sure what that is is that a board game oh it's oh it's the

but in Japan with Dragon Quest Final Fantasy characters Psycho Break 2 in Japan this week and
Lego ninja go movie the game and I go Ninjago I would say ninja go cuz I can't help but think
of the ninja wrap I saw that movie last night ninja go is all right oh the Ninjago movie yeah
huh it was all right wasn't cuz the others I it's not as funny as the other ones but it had its
funny moments and if you want to show your undying love for Gran Turismo sport you can actually pick
up the PlayStation 4 Gran Turismo sport it actually looks pretty sick I like it it's a
gray and I really like the way the controller looks in that so you can get that in Japan if
you really want this week but I don't know if you're gonna pay that much money for it on the

of the show where we would jump into the mailbag and read the emails that you send us participate
at orange launch radio.com but I'm not sure we have anything let's not remember see yeah there
were someone there oh were there well yeah from the eighth oh I guess okay yeah I guess the eighth
was seven days ago we didn't read them on the last show no all right well the eighth happened
after the last show no that was the last show that was Sunday okay well then shit I don't think I
read them but whatever let me look I'm gonna look over your shoulder real quick because it says yeah
I don't remember reading this we probably didn't because it weren't you not here oh okay then move
them into the trash can when you have done read them sorry I'll stop piling dishes in the same
and that's a good habit leaving the seat up those are all good habits to have all right so there
were no emails this week shame on all of you you can send us an email if you like participate at
orange lounge radio.com do a kitten poker did last week and send an email it says hi I just
don't want your mailbox to be empty although we appreciate questions or insight especially
perspective if you have a reaction to a story that we talk about here on the show an email to
go along with that always helps participate at orange lounge radio.com not hiccups at
orange lounge radio.com but participate at orange lounge radio.com we do have some more news stories
to get into though and then we'll open up our skype line at orange lounge radio on skype all
one word let's get to those stories first though starting with Loki yes this week they have the
oculus connect event so they made several announcements regarding the oculus platform
so along with that of course is that the price drop that they did back in the summer for the
oculus rift is now gonna be permanent so that'll be $3.99 now for the headset and two sensors and
the touch controllers and I guess a bunch of games so you can check that out also they announce that
their standalone headset that's gonna be its own platform that doesn't require any sort of phone
or anything is gonna be coming out pretty soon that is the oculus go it's gonna be coming up for
$199 and apparently you know it is gonna be its own standalone thing it's gonna have a single palm
controller kind of similar to what they have with the oc the gear VR so it's gonna be a little bit
different in that sense then they also announced there was yet another platform that they were
working on but that's not they're sending out dev kits for that right now so that's something
that's in the future but it's gonna be kind of think similar long lines of the oculus go but
more souped up it probably more expensive along with that they were showing off some new games
that are gonna be coming out for the rift one of which is being worked on by respawn entertainment
so they've you know got a game coming as well I'm not sure exactly what it's gonna be but they've
made some pretty cool games Bobby's in our chat room over at live dot vog network comm saying
that oculus go is the gear VR but without the phone requirements that's pretty much the level
of awesome you can expect out of that yeah I mean it's something it's something you know if you're
if you're an Apple person you know you know you don't really have access to gear VR so this is
some way you could do that so I mean Alan has the gear VR cuz he got his when he got his galaxy
yeah I I have one but mines for these six so it's pretty old and they've used it the first day and
we haven't used it since just saying I've used it a couple times I use the gear the oculus F kid to
more than I have the gear VR and honestly I don't like using it with my phone too much because my
phone screens kind of it's not as high resolution as it could possibly be and I don't know it's just
the stuff that you can get on the phone games it's not all that great they've got minecraft
which is kind of cool but I would be more interested in something now that I have a more
powerful PC that can actually do VR more interested in playing that in fact actually having bothered to
hook up my DK to to my PC but I'm kind of curious to see what that would be like now they can run
the frame rates for some of those games mm-hmm but I do want to get an actual oculus headset
at some point or vibe five is more expensive though but hopefully with them dropping the price
permanently that'll drive them to drop their price yeah there's a little VR refresh happening going
on right now cuz PlayStation VR just had their Japan just got right and then also there's still
all those other VR devices that are gonna be coming for like Windows for like Windows
holographic and stuff like that so you know where are those because those are supposed to be cheaper
in price as well so eventually it'll be just like buying a monitor mm-hmm yeah me interesting all
right well moving on maybe maybe a game that you can play in VR if they're making it for it I don't
know is riot games next game because it is funny that they're called riot games when they only
really have one game which of course is League of Legends if you weren't already aware now League
of Legends has been a game that's been around since what 11 years been a while at least riot
games been around since 2006 I don't think League of Legends came out right away but it's been out a
little while but anyway the two founders of riot games did say this week they are handing off the
management of League of Legends to other folks so they can make a new game it will be the second
big video game released for riot games in their time that they have been operating so that's
pretty awesome so they are gonna be handing over those operations to the chief financial officer
so as the chief technical officer and the president of the company we don't know what that game is
gonna look like we may see some type of phone game who knows or maybe they would get into making who
knows an MMO they could do anything so we'll see what riot games decides to develop and to be fair
I guess they actually have done tabletop tabletop and small games so the s in riot games is
justified but as far as like you know games on video of sorts go this is really the only one
they've got so they'll have another one oh maybe in like seven years when they finally finish it
right because video games take a little while to work on I don't know if you guys know video
games take a while to finish right low-key loot boxes are hard to develop yes right they have to
find that I've already had to work in all my monetization stuff you know that's that's why
I'm planning first because as I've been shown by the triple-a industry that is the most important
does League of Legends have loot boxes I don't think it does they have it's like the in-game
gold that you earn and then you use that in-game gold to buy the skins and stuff I thought we had
buy it skins because obviously it's a free-to-play game you gotta be making their money some earn in
game gold slowly or you put the money now it's like Heroes of the Storm used to be before Heroes
of the Storm put in loot boxes and now Heroes of the Storm runs on once again though both free
games I don't care that's I'm fine with that if it's a free game right it's just that double
dipping feeling that I don't like right all right but we won't rehash the conversation from earlier
so let's move on to what Dark Sakura has for us I got some stuff you want to see what I have sure
it has to do with Minecraft um never mind just kidding Minecraft still cool well you know how
people have built these like amazing recreations of like Helms Deep and all of this business well
there is a like a sculpture event that happens in Minecraft there's one that's called the perfect
marionette that won first place in the contest and I mean it is massive and it's a full-on
sculpture I mean if you look at it closer yeah you can see it's made up of little bricks but I mean
just from a distance it looks like a full-on like sculpture sculpture and there are like just some
crazy ones like one looks like a an explosion in mid explode and just all these other things it's
absolutely amazing and the fact that you know this game has quite literally turned into an art form
I was gonna say like some people paint with watercolor some people paint with oils some
people are using Minecraft it's crazy but like awesome but it still requires I think some of the
same skills that one would have in doing any type of sculpture or other kind of rendering absolutely
to do a proper sculpture you have to have your sense of movement you have to have your son well
I'd say dynamic movement you also have to have your color balance you have to have scale I mean
it's really some amazing work these people have done I knew a gal years ago and I mean years ago
like back when I first did Rocky Horror at the bird cage that's how long ago was right I knew
this gal and one hobby that she used to enjoy she made paintings but she did them in MS paint I kid
you not she did them pixel by pixel she would zoom in all this is she could do her little art pixel
by pixel and I I can't help but think you know I've lost touch with her over the years I have no
idea where she is today but if she's discovered minecraft like that would be perfect for her
because isn't that what minecraft is basically this it's sculpting pixel by pixel right sort
of it really is and yeah I've seen I've seen some amazing work done in MS paint so it's really the
equivalent oh yeah remember when they tried to get rid of it people lost their shit because they
were going to 3d paint or whatever yeah yeah so they're MS paint that's right but there's there's
some website now what was that site you could you could go on there and it's just like MS paint you
make your drawing but like it saves it on the web and you can like share your drawings other people
dang there's some art site and used to be like a game people would do I remember though it was it
was a networked art program and I can't remember what it was called but I used to use it all the
time where we just get like it was actually I was I was using it with Tiara and our friend Kim and
we would and a few other people but we would all get into like have a live server and play in this
graphics program dark Tetsuya says oh a cocky no I think I remember oh a cocky though I think that
was yeah I'm that's close to what I'm thinking of but that's not it I remember oh a cocky that
was like that's more like a type though that was that's like a 1998 thing yeah well really um but
now I can't remember what it was called but it was really fun I mean and now especially I'd say
that's even one of our earlier precursors to the you know now collaborative applications we have
but still I mean I love watching people turn the most unexpected thing into real art you know so
it's pretty cool yeah all right well you go artists in Minecraft meanwhile Loki all right
so kind of keeping on track with VR of course not to be out valve had some announcements regarding
additional components to developing VR systems for device manufacturers basically the new technology
is available with the free license that's available for valves room scale VR tracking technology and
they say it includes an optical system manufacturing calibration tools and software
that aims to make a better user experience and says the new features now they're meant to allow
I guess better you know steam VR compatible head-mounted displays also increased sharpness
head tracking and that sort of thing so that's cool once again you know it's like we saw with
these other companies developing their own VR devices that are kind of giving you compatible
with one platform I think Val's taking a smart approach with it too because you know unlike
oculus it's kind of like okay we've got our own storefront that's separate from everything valve
is like okay hey let's make as many devices as we can that support steam because everybody uses
team so why not I'm all for that especially that means I'm gonna get a cheaper headset later on
that's still pretty good the price of this technology is coming down and I think that's
how more and more people are gonna end up adopting it sooner or later yeah sooner or later and then
more and more applications are becoming available better applications because right now we're still
kind of in that whole Nintendo DS touchscreen thing where no one knows how to utilize the tech
they're just kind of like doing these gimmicky games it's gonna be more smartly used I guess so
check that out well and finally in the news tonight something that you've been waiting all
show for because Jason referenced it in tonight's introduction a big thanks to Jason by the way he
always does those intros to our show we appreciate it I'm gonna miss them next week as he'll be at
twitch con so you're stuck with me and looks like unless I can get a guest announcer maybe we'll try
to get a guest announcer next week but anyway this is a new playable character for WWE 2k 18
I don't know if you guys play those games at all but if you do you can look forward to a brand new
playable character in WWE and you might be wondering well which wrestler is this based off
of is it is it going to be my twin Sami Zayn well he might be in the game too but this particular
character I want to talk about is Colonel Sanders that's right Colonel Sanders KFC his character
now there is catch you have to assemble him in create a wrestler but you can actually do it
because I guess the guests are sponsored achievements and trophies in this too boy
you think loot boxes are bad here's a glimpse at the future on our last they already do that
they like in Madden they ever they had advertisements in Madden for like other
things not talking about like integrated into the arenas like you know you'd see
well they actually integrate into the loading screens like for cell phone service and stuff
like that so that's been a thing and sponsored stuff I mean it's silly but this kind of stuff
I like it's just dumb I mean who doesn't want to see Colonel Sanders beating down people the
question is why is it more you know we need more of this like I know I want Colonel Sanders to be
beating up the scary King thing from Burger King that I don't even thinks been the mascot for years
we still need our and Wendy because all those companies yeah have you seen Burger King and
Wendy on Twitter recently they are savage to each other they are not nice like this
2017 you guys when you when you can't wait to be dragged by a corporate brand on Twitter and then
we have Arby's being cool with their marketing yeah Arby's Arby's does Arby's the only thing
Arby's has going for it is they have a 50 50 50 shake that's like an orange cream shake that's
fucking awesome everything else at Arby's fucking terrible I would disagree with that I split a
sandwich with Dan and there was so much meat in it that it was two sandwiches worth it was pretty
good deal yeah but it's like now if I can get whoever does those ads to make like little you
know sculptures for me I would my favorite was a little peach on one they did for Rama it was so
cute mm-hmm like a meat sculpture I mean their ads are they take like the the their sandwich
boxes and make like anime figures and video game figures and scenes from like the other day they
did like an emu yasha one they're so cute oh see that must have been what happened was they
converted their box into a sandwich and that's what I ate because it's certainly what it tasted
like all right well that is our last story that we have up for the night so that means it's time
for the Skype line and you can give us a call over at orange lounge radio all one word on Skype if
you'd like to give us a call and talk about anything we've discussed so far tonight or
maybe there's something you want to talk about again that's orange lounge radio all one word
on Skype and it's lighting up right now so let's get to it and then a little later I'll be checking
in to see if there's any last-minute stories as well but I think it's connecting and we have a
call on the line hello you're oh it's not connected nope hi you're on orange lounge radio who's this
trust me Rob we're fully connected here oh well when you put it that way what's on your mind
tonight buddy oh I didn't know the cam was gone I put some clothes on I'm sorry yeah no we know
me oh we're echoing by the way so be careful about that yeah we know we still have the cam
we're gonna be on this rig for a little while sadly until we can test some new things Loki is
gonna be bringing the laptop into this so we can test a conversion over and yeah I'm just paranoid
about some new things but Loki has a computer we can play with so that's exciting well I will
email you about that because that's how we do our Skype line for our show fabulous I'd like to know
more about it well what's on your mind tonight well I just want to say that the Twitter accounts
for Arby's Wendy's and Burger King gives me life it gets me through my day and Denny's which God
what what shit food no but it's more Wendy's because of lewd Wendy and everybody I know
cosplaying her it was yeah do people actually cosplay the Wendy's character and Ronald McDonald
of course they do why asking this question there's a reddit for people posting their
boobies next to Pokemon of course people can of course you know like with Saints Row freckle
bitches that's really a thing that's really a thing because for a while somebody in one Asian
countries I forget where actually did a gingka forms of all of the fast-food mascots and there
were short run doujins and people were cosplaying them unless you probably missed it when I was
posting them on Facebook but when I posted Colonel Sanders a third of women were like daddy
oh my god no I I did miss that there's the way he was drawn all the women were like hi I guess
I haven't they kind of like redone Colonel Sanders anyway he's not they de-aged him a few years maybe
not just a skosh but um it's a skosh what what's good here um I feel you on the YouTube strikes
because every time we go to a con and we upload interviews and masquerades I get strikes from Sony
Warner all of them because of the music and I'm like these are not monetary videos keep up here
for free leave me alone and yeah you're only using if you use a little clip you're not really
supposed to be able to I mean that's still like fair use or whatever so it's just okay you're
taking problem yeah the problem is the fact when people do their skits they're using commercial
music and it's like you can't tell no and I see nothing wrong with I'm not charging it's like
people just want to see what they miss because they couldn't go that weekend right yeah I guess
but what happens ultimately they put the claim on your video but they don't really get to do
anything right they run ads and then they get the revenue okay so they're running ads and they get
the revenue and also one or two things happen either they will be like okay you ain't got to
worry about it it's fine or you get an email saying your video has been muted in this country
this video is our bit this country and then you get work this video has been pulled so I have I
had it bookmarked somewhere this little text of paraphrase text of fear use they copy paste in
and I send it to that to YouTube and usually within about three days they like okay fine video
is good to go it's the whole the whole kid dancing to Prince thing right didn't that go all the way
to the Supreme Court and the they they sided with the the person it was like the little kid in the
video dancing to a prince song right what do we miss that so I don't know hmm I'm trying to
remember yeah yeah they ruled in the favor of the family not the music company or you can just
always do what Jim Sterling does which is the whole copyright deadlock so instead of instead
of using you know if you know that there's gonna be like a video flag like say you have
Nintendo content in there what you do is you throw in random content from other providers
that you know are gonna get flagged as well so he'll throw in like Activision stuff and Sony
music stuff and the problem is is everybody creates a copyright claim on the the chat on
the piece of video and since you know multiple people can't be the owner of that con copyright
content nothing happens to it either I get the money or no one gets exactly none of them get
the money I even got flagged by Nintendo okay yeah I've had a couple videos back flagged by
Nintendo but to be fair it was like my let's remember you know when I first was trying to
streamy stuff of Legend of Zelda which you know okay fine they had a they had a case to it I wish
there was just a way we could like split revenue instead of but well you can you can you can sign
up as one of their partners and you get a tiny pittance of their uh revenue hard pass yeah the
thing is my Nintendo video this was when they now this was at the midnight release of the Wii U I'm

week and beyond yeah I'm recovering from my four-day whirlwind trip so yeah I'll be talking
about that you were over here on this coast right no I was in the midwest this is what happened

for us yeah my friend did get married this weekend but I couldn't I couldn't take the time off and
just so you guys know I was able to do Seattle not New York because Seattle 80 dollars I only
took one day off of work to do it because I had a long weekend anyway so uh but New York is still
something we're looking at hopefully for next year Rob we'll do we'll have fabulous week again real
soon seriously sounds good I'm gonna hold you to that better all right take care of my friend
thanks for calling too bro take care all right bye all right we're gonna uh open up the skype
line again for anyone else who wants to call over at orange lounge radio all one word on skype if
you'd like to give us a call to talk about whatever's on your mind tonight regarding
video games hopefully but I don't know it's been a short part b compared to part a who knows all
right well at least the phones are lighting up tonight so the emails might have disappointed but
the phones so far at least are not so the only thing about using this little ipad thing is it
takes a little longer to connect and then sometimes the callers hang up anyway so uh
that just would happen there so we'll have to wait and see if that person calls back
uh loki did you have a last minute story while we try to wait for another call here at orange
andreo on skype no not really i mean um bethesda did another twitter like post for wolfenstein
um and of course you know it's the whole you know make not make america nazi free again type stuff
oh yes well they had one now that's basically kind of a new one on top of that that said
there's only one side to this and so if you're a nazi then like fuck off or something to that
fact all right well we have another caller on the line so let's get to it hi you're on orange
lounge radio who's this hey this is act deaf hey act deaf what's on your mind buddy well finally
my sns classic the story came to a good ending yay i heard i i saw this on twitter so you finally
got your sns classic right yeah i finally did after two weeks but yeah i finally did so what
happened did amazon try to make nice nice or was it just out of the blue suddenly they were like
oh we got it now yeah it was totally out of the blue uh on wednesday like wednesday morning uh
i got an email for one of my sns classic orders that said i was going to get it next wednesday
until the 18th and then i uh and i started searching on twitter if any uh any other person
and people uh started getting their emails and yeah it's um uh a lot of people started getting
emails and and yeah i i then got another email confirming about my other sns classic order
for a friend so it was great but i didn't expect it that amazon the next day sent me a notification
about oh you're getting this sns classic tomorrow delivered i'm like whoa really yeah maybe that
was their kind of like nice nice thing was that since they took so long instead of doing the two
day shipping they went ahead and bumped it up to the overnight shipping maybe that was their little
consolation whatever they could do yeah most probably but i'm happy that i got it and probably
earlier than i then i expected i would have loved it that they would have fulfilled the order
on time at all but it this is better than nothing at least so i don't have to finally have one i
bet uh question from our chat over at live.vognetwork.com ssj100 matt says so are you
going to keep amazon prime after all this because it seemed like an issue with nintendo
more than amazon then again they didn't look good with the treasure truck stuff
i'm gonna keep amazon not because of amazon itself because of twitch
okay yeah since since i do use the the free subscription thank you for that and
and yeah especially because of you uh but still the the promotions i get from twitch like the
twitch prime loot boxes and all that stuff it's really great so i i don't want to miss that
so instead of like just paying for twitch prime i'll pay for amazon too and keep the
all the other stuff too so but i'll probably think twice before or ordering something on amazon at
least uh nintendo stuff and and reservations so yeah very interesting and i bet you know to be
fair uh amazon probably loves that answer that you know there's more than just the shipping
that's the kind of the value in being amazon prime you know at least in you know in their minds you
know and again you would have what like the amazon tv because you know we sometimes forget that oh
yeah amazon has a tv service as well where you know they've got their shows like transparent
does very well and you know some of their other stuff um and then uh you know that what they got
a music thing now too and stuff so this is all going to be justification for them to keep upping
the price i'm sure um let's see uh bobby blackwolf in chat says i wish twitch allowed the amazon
family accounts to use the twitch prime stuff even if it was only one per account i wish i
didn't have to tie my fiance's amazon prime account to my twitch to get the prime benefits
so well there's maybe uh you actually can because that's what uh my brother and i do that oh so you
actually can uh don't know if it's something on on the accounts or something that you have to change
oh bobby says not in the us oh well maybe that's that's the thing but uh yeah my brother and i can
and it's and it's different account so well rub it in why don't you i'm just kidding all right
here's another serious question before we let you go now that you have the super nintendo
classic in your hand what do you think it's it's really great i i i'm loving it so far even though
i haven't played that much uh because i got it yesterday basically uh but i'm loving it it's
really practical because even like last night uh i had a a party with some friends uh a friend of
mine uh had a birthday a celebration so since we're all gamers i i pretty much thought well
everybody wants to see the esnes classic so i'll take it and we all everybody had a blast
everybody wanted to play uh we played street fighter uh kirby's dream course he had lots of
fun and me personally i have uh and i haven't played it much uh that much sorry but i'm loving
it because of just only because of the games because the 21 games that are there are really
great even despite the star fox not being that uh not aging that well but aside from that it's
a really great machine and i even love it more than than the next classic despite the next
classic like having three games and having all those games also really great but don't know that
the next classic seems like a better value even well in the next year we get to do this all over
again for the game boy classic so just hold on yeah and i was actually gonna ask something about
uh and the relevance of that yeah sure because uh well the the anniversary for uh the third
anniversary is gonna be until uh 2019 but i was thinking about uh if if nintendo goes uh and makes
a gameboy mini would would just would you have rather have uh like an app on your phone or would
you rather see something like the switch that you can have a portable gameboy mini gameboy classic
and also hook it up to your tv oh good question i would like to see a simple hdmi out cable i
think could fix a lot of that um but then maybe you'd have to be able to plug in a controller
that could get a little dicey um um with like a port they have like portable nes emulators i
think yeah so i mean yeah something's anything's possible with that but um i would like to more
see a link cable i think that would be hilarious if you can actually connect two game boys together
with a link cable no i think that's something they might do especially so people can relive
the pokemon stuff but if they are going to do a gameboy classic and they put pokemon on it
they're gonna have to figure out a way to get these things in the pokemon bank so your idea
about it being able to talk to the switch somehow maybe through infrared maybe not too far off so
maybe not necessarily like link it to the switch but like having the switch port the tv doc have
it like uh uh like an output for tv so you can play like oh you can play gameboy uh games like
in the super game boy back in the day that'd be awesome but then again with this being nintendo
i'm not gonna hold my breath either or how about we just release the fucking virtual console
how about that we just released the virtual console for the switch don't talk crazy now
come on i know it's just so weird that you know i would expect them to put something that's been on
the last few systems on their current system they want us to all forget that we bought an nes classic
so that way when they release balloon fight yet again we're ready to buy it again that's
that's what we're waiting on here so yeah early next year probably all right act after i'm gonna
let you go to try to see if anyone else wants to get through but thank you and i'm i'm very happy
that this amazon story had a happy ending and thank you i think it's good that we follow up
on happy endings as well as negative endings so i appreciate the call hey thanks for having me
all right take care my friend have a good night you do all right one eight seven seven game olr
if you want to do it the old-fashioned way but orange lounge radio on skype is an even better
way because for a limited time it's the only way you get to see video here in the studio
or just it's really just me it's the ipad pointed at me because we're using an old ipad i can't
believe this is now an old ipad but it is it's it's ipad three or the new ipad or whatever they
called it at that time that's what we're running skype off of right now orange lounge radio all
one word on skype we'll just give it a few minutes to see if anybody wants to get through
but if not then we'll probably go ahead and wrap things up i'll check in one more time with my
co-host to see if there's any last minute excuse me last minute stories yeah yeah with the latest
trend that we've been seeing uh with people coming to twitter and stuff to report sexual abuse and
scandals of course there's a few ties with the gaming industry um there was i think was the
gaming grumps or something like that there was a whole issue with that but now we've got someone
heard that yeah there was one i don't remember it was some group i think it was the game grumps it
may have been i could be wrong i heard only read the story once but it was like the head happens
that's the head thing to get wrong so right yeah so don't take my word for it um anyways so there
was a guy by the name of david ballard who was an environmental and multi or very mental and
multiplayer level artist for uncharted two through four and last of us apparently he uh with the
twitter talking about some sexual harassment that he received at from his workplace so he said in
late 2015 i was sexually harassed the naughty dog by a lead my work environment became extremely
toxic afterward in february 2016 i had a mental breakdown at work and suddenly playstation hr
became involved well i told him about the harassment the end of the call and fired me
the next day they decided the company was moving in a different direction and my job was no longer
needed they tried to silence me by offering me twenty thousand dollars if i signed a letter
agreeing to the termination as well as not to disclose it with anyone else i declined to sign
i've been unemployed for 17 months since this is when the interviewers um asked why i left
naughty dog i said i was burned out by the crunch ashamed to get to the root of the problem of being
sexually harassed i'm speaking out now because of the strength of i've seen others come forward
about their experiences in tv film industry it's the hardest thing i've ever had i've ever done in
laywin uh kill my drive or love for video game industry and my passion for life and then of
course they naughty dog released the statement as well as we've been recently uh we have recently
read on social media the next employee of naughty dog dave allard claims he was sexually harassed
when he worked at naughty dog we have not found any evidence of having received allegations from
mr ballard as he was harassed in any way of naughty dog or sony or active entertainment
harassment inappropriate conduct have no place at naughty dog or sony interactive entertainment
we have taken and always will report sexual harassment and other workplace grievances very
seriously and blah blah blah so so i don't i don't know where to go without getting too soapboxy with
this whole thing but it's very obvious that i think there's been a lot of dark shit that's
happened out there and finally people are putting their fucking foot down and saying we're not going
to fucking take this anymore and even the once thought impenetrable hollywood dark stories of
casting couches and things like that you know finally people are saying we are sick of this
shit period and it's just a sad reminder that everything you're seeing happening in hollywood
right now it's not unique to hollywood it happens pretty much in every industry and it needs to stop
and some shithole guy who was like a lawyer in the industry was going out saying well now we're
gonna hear nothing but this in the future like it's a bad thing that it's coming out to light
how long is have a lot of people probably repress this exactly well right now on facebook there
actually is the people posting me too it's happening on twitter it's happening everywhere
yeah people need to fucking see it it happens a lot more than you think it is and it needs to stop
and people that you'll never be a part of it and never judge anybody by what they wear no one is
ever fucking asking for it it's just disgusting i'm nothing is consent except consent exactly
and lack of an answer is not consent so anyway all right a good uh a good uh lesson to end the show
on tonight but uh you know we i know we say uh game industry needs to do better here's an example
and i realize it's a dicey situation there's you know his story a naughty dog story and so forth
but you know what um it's probably this is probably one unfortunately unfortunately of
many stories that are out there and um people need to do better and be better people and not
prey on um other people yeah i was unable to find out which site that was there was a pretty major
site i just don't remember i may be remembering who it was yeah correctly i saw it like i can't
i can't find it so we'll presume everyone to be innocent for now all right well since our
skype line is not lighting up with any more calls i'm going to assume that is it for the calls
tonight and i think it's about time we go ahead and we wrap things up here at orange launch radio
for the night but i do once again want to thank you guys for participating with our program whether
it was live or it was on the podcast feed either way you are awesome for stopping by orange launch
radio and the motivation why we do this show every week uh if you liked what you heard here
at orange on radio please tell a friend or two about the show because it is the
show where every gamer has a voice but you know we need uh we need to spread the word to have
those voices here of course a nice five star review on a site like itunes or wherever it is
you found this podcast those go a really long way like i can't emphasize how much good those things
do for you to take 15 seconds and do something like that uh it's a great great great gift so
thank you um that's gonna do it i think we're ready to wrap things up with final thoughts
tonight um i'm going to start tonight because mine's a little bit of a downer so i apologize
for it but i have to get it off my chest um our cat sanrio is is not doing well um she's breathing
kind of funky and we're a little worried uh it could be something that's hopefully easily cleared
up but it may be something that's um not um she's 17 years old so we're kind of mentally prepared
that you know this this may be something really bad um but that's something we do we are we do
have a vet thing set up for tomorrow so i just appreciate all the uh all the kind thoughts and
anything whatever it is that you believe in out there that you can put in the universe that'll
help help our kitty i'd uh really appreciate that so um sorry for the downer but it's been on my
my mind all night so uh dark sakura your final thought tonight hopefully something a little
better sorry um well i'm not exactly the biggest bundle of positivity sorry um but uh we're
we're going to have a donut donuts donuts all right that's a great note and have a donut have
a donut i found it sorry um it was not gaming grumps so not the tarnished surname screen junkies
a guy named andy sigmar uh signor was the accused of it apparently um there's a woman by the name
that came out and talked about it um saying that you know uh and apparently a lot more people i
think came out about it as well showing the new texts about how they were um he was sexually
harassing several people over dms on twitter and all sorts of things so that was the case and so
they're looking at screen junkies and defy media they're looking into it but he's been um i think
suspended while they conduct their investigation so that's what's been going on well thank you for
your commitment to righting any wrongs that you may put out there here on the show garbage humans
belong in the garbage uh you do have an opportunity here though to make an actual last thought here if
you'd like loki maybe something positive like donuts donuts i don't know i don't want donuts
um i don't know just hopefully i'll play some actual games this week playing games that's a
positive thing and donuts that's the reason playing games while eating donuts yes that's
pretty much how you can sum up us here at orange lounge radio so uh enjoy your video games and
