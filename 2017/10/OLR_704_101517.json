{"text": " This week WWE 2K18 has been released and the internet is weighing in on the finger licking Colonel Sanders who's going to grill you up and serve you on a platter. And that's just one piping hot story. Stay tuned for the rest of the night's news served to order starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio Hello my friends out there on the internet welcome back it's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice it is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight episode number 704 for this October the 15th of 2017 my name is Rob Roberts joining you from our headquarters here in Sacramento California by my side as she always is DarkSakura or Jamie Summers oh hi how are you okay yeah yeah any exciting fun things is no rock concerts this week to speak of no yeah so this week couldn't nearly have been as good as last week with gorillas and everything right just a week of self improvement there you go there you go a moment of zen a week of zen focusing on me there you go I I get myself the best birthday gifts I hope you treat yourself as well or as they say on Parks and Rec treat yourself though I still owe somebody here some Legos hey that sounds like I just haven't had time to go out don't worry about it a treat for Tech Master Loki over there yes what you don't want more Legos no I I always want more Legos is whether it's gonna happen how how many times have you stepped on a Lego brick barefoot because we all know that's like one of the worst things that could possibly happen to you it's not I used to walk on them so I mean it's fine so I found out this week that Loki and I both like the same show I know we don't talk a lot about TVs and movies here on OLR because you know we have other shows here at the voice geeks network where we do tape live Sunday nights at six o'clock Pacific's nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show we have a lot of great shows here to talk about that stuff we don't really get to talk about it here as much but I found out that you and I are both big fans of the show called the good place yes it's a really funny show it is hilarious I started binge watching I don't even know what made me do it I think I think just a lot of my friends are talking about how funny it was as I was like all right it's like a 25 minute show I won't take that long I like marathoned the first season in like two and a half days yeah we ran out of episodes so yeah and there's only it's only on its second season so it's pretty easy yeah it started second season yeah so I liked it a lot I thought it was really funny so I don't want to spoil it too much well the the premise is that the main character who's Kristen Bell who was Veronica Mars right but she's a little older now she she died and she wakes up in the good place which is the opposite of the bad place so she would you know because obviously I don't think the show wants to get too religious so it's about her you know adventures in the good place and the people that she meets and the maybe not so good things that are happening well yes in the main twist which they kind of reveal in the first episode is that she's not really supposed to be there yeah it's a mistake yes yes that is in the first episode so he's not really spoiling anything too crazy and so it's kind of her trying to fake it and you know try to make it into you know this thing and then all sorts of crazy stuff happens yeah so who's your favorite character because my favorite character on that whole show is Evil Janet pretty good I I also like I can't remember his name the the dude that plays like the silent monk Oh Johnny Johnny yeah yeah yes but yes it's true his trooper yes yes not to spoil anything but yeah hisself itself yes I like how his interactions uh let's see I know it's John who was his name I think John it was his name anyway I when I watch a show like that I can tie it see watch I can tie anything back to video games because the way they present that the good place is kind of built is that like there's this architect that creates the good place for a certain number of people it's totally like the sims like I swear the people that invented that show probably thought how could we turn the sims into a TV show like is it just me or does that does it feel like a lot yeah yeah without all the like death traps and stuff yeah without all of that so I'm going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com a couple people starting with a Kossen saying you can talk to me about the Orville which I'm hearing a lot of good things about I haven't gotten around to that yet because I've been watching Star Trek Discovery which you know I realize a lot of people are watching Orville instead of Star Trek Discovery which cheap plug I did appear on starboard power coupling this week so if you want to check out our synopsis of episode 4 go check out those kids the starboard power coupling podcast which is part of vognetwork it's it's there under our podcast course I got to get in the stranger thing season 2 when they come oh shit that's like only two weeks away that's two weeks exciting and that's as we got into last week that's a game now too yep it is dark soccer is there anything you're watching on the telly nope no I don't really like TV but you've watched a few things like you guys watch the Castlevania anime which I still need to do I watch things when they come out and then I get it over with yeah so I watched stranger things I'm gonna watch the next season I watched Jessica Jones and I watched Luke Cage and I watched Defenders okay and I tried to watch iron fist but it was completely fucking ridiculous some stuff I'm not watching anything okay okay right now I see what you mean so like you you wait and then you like binge it all at once and then it's done I get it okay oh the one thing I am continuously watching every time an episode comes out is Dragon Ball super okay that's it and you know I'll have RuPaul's Drag Race in January yeah so will you yeah I'll watch Drag Race that one now no I know that's a lie if you're gonna try to tell me as for anything on TV right now no I'm not watching anything I'm mostly a YouTube watcher so I watch the cuisine of the 18th century with James Townsend and son speaking of well sorry if I don't want to interrupt or anything but I was gonna say speaking of YouTube actually one channel that's been putting out stuff in the interim is awesome games done quick they do these little I don't know what they're called but they're like small little turn it like tournament runs type that they're doing so they did one the other day that was it's a link to the past randomizer and so what that means is basically all the drops like the different items are randomized in the actual the Legend of Zelda randomizer yes so they it's final fantasy randomizer like original NES Final Fantasy randomizer and I think it's a similar concept yeah so that was kind of fun I watched that for a good couple hours the other day but yeah they've been putting out content like almost once a week but the other thing that I'm watching regularly on YouTube is outside Xbox mm-hmm which is a UK like gaming top best-of list and they don't just stick to Xbox stuff I'm just saying that you know it's really funny they have some good perspectives and I've actually picked up a few like I didn't know the threshold trick in Mass Effect 2 where if you do when you're doing grunt's loyalty mission there's a particular screw that you can stand behind and just shoot and shoot and shoot and the thing can't hit you but you can hit it I know about that there you go I just go headfirst into everything I always forget that YouTube is like a thing that people can like legitimately watch shows on like it's a very different sort of thing and you'd think I'd be more aware because I've always been very like rah rah rah do a podcast make a podcast so you'd think I'd be the same way for YouTube and TV and I am but I just don't find that I have the time to sit down I watch little things here and there but I don't get into a lot of series I also watch a lot of the NHK TV shows so I mean I don't watch them regularly so I can't say I am watching them but I'll go through just big bursts of watching like begin Japan ology or bento or was it called lunch on it's all about bento and you know certain like arts and crafts shows I'm and I watch a lot of history stuff on YouTube because I love fucking I love documentaries I love history I like documentaries too but like more like socially based ones I don't watch a lot of like the history like wars and stuff I like the social I like the history ones where they go into how events unfolded and affected people more of the I guess combination of anthropology sociology and history so that because I think that if you don't look at history through the lens of someone who experienced it then you can't see how it applies to modern life and too many people don't want to look at history oh that was terrible it was a war ba ba ba ba ba you know what I mean but when you look at it through the people's eyes what they suffered and then we see what's happening today oh my god you will cry because fuck what's going on right now I like watching it's totally trash but the internet historian on YouTube and he does kind of documentary type features of trolling in memes and stuff and it's it's it's actually kind of fascinating because it's stuff that I would have never heard about but they go into great detail about stuff like balloon boy or you know dash con and all those weird stuff that they do just I don't know it's pretty funny I mean it's it's trash because it's like these people are trolling people right but it's it's entertaining to watch from an outside perspective right okay well speaking I do want to mention real quick because I don't think it made our show world tonight but I saw it floating around out there because you brought up awesome games done quick yeah the schedule is out for the next awesome games done quick which would be the winter one in a couple mad why are you mad well disappointed why is that because Super Metroid isn't on the last Super Metroid I don't know if that's about whatever happened you know last year but I'm also disappointed because our pal and friend of the show Flaco Jones submitted for PT and again sadly did not get in but you know they got a lot of talented people I was looking because they actually have posted like what they accepted and what they rejected oh my god like there's a lot I mean it's no wonder Flaco is submitted several times it keeps getting bumped because there's just tons of stuff that gets submitted maybe they can do another one three times a year so many speedrunners out there for sure maybe he can do his own marathon for charity and donate it to the awesome games done quick actually I would I would love to see you know I know we've been talking about it for a long time and maybe we're gonna need some help from some people that are better event planners than we are such as the folk that folks that do sack gamer collective I believe is the new name you know our pals over there because especially with all the wildfires that's been going on here in Northern California I'd really love to see I don't know if you guys know but like an old friend of the show DDR angel she was like luckily last I heard everything's okay but I know like her life got turned upside down by the evacuations and all that stuff and I'm sure she's not the only one that we know of that listens to the show that's that's really run into a problem so it'll be really cool if we can kind of do something to help because it's been you know even here in Sacramento I mean we're fine guys we're like a hundred miles from everything but like the air has been toxic here like I kind of have to stay indoors it's fine today but I mean like Monday Tuesday we're it's still hazy though yeah so I mean did you see from San Francisco as well oh yeah it was pretty terrible I just like the post that's not fog yeah this time um but the I do well Dan has worked done a marathon for Child's Play before and we've got all the stuff set up at my house that we could stream okay so all we have to do is just set up an account for donations and then donate the whole thing to whichever charity is handling the wildfires it wouldn't be that hard yeah we'll figure something out maybe hopefully in the coming months because you know it's not like the needs are gonna go away in two months so we'll see what we can do so and all else fails there are charities lots of worthy causes I'm associated with one so yeah anyway I did want to mention in chat real quick because I think this is a good point over at live dot vog network comm Bobby black wolf who's on before us says in chat we all know super Metroid will be a donation incentive so there is that maybe we don't know the the final final answers yet so that's a that's good Brad from pod culture says 24 hours of vog game streaming I'm sure there's enough of us I hey even if we raised a hundred bucks I'd be thrilled that's a hundred bucks they didn't have before so you know if it's a small turnout who cares you don't do it for the size of turnout you do it for the the donations and awareness even if it's just a little awareness so all right well anyhow I do want to get into some other gaming content and some of the news would talk about at the top of the show because I know we went on some nerd tangents but it's been I don't think we have a lot a lot of news tonight but of course I say that and those are the four-hour shows so let's kick off tonight's talking about loot boxes because it seems like just in general the concept of loot boxes has been in the news a lot especially this seems to be getting worse and what if the problem here's what it is is a lot of people dismiss loot boxes as oh it's cosmetic oh this and that right we've been seeing lately with a lot of games that they're specifically creating these games to push loot boxes or they're taking aspects of the game out to put them in loot boxes because they can make extra money and loot boxes are finding like a free-to-play game or even fine like I even I don't blame overwatch too much because that is just cosmetic stuff well I I kind of think that overwatch is the reason everybody's course of course watch wasn't the first bite but like blizzard fans are like I'm trying to think of a tactful way to say this but blizzard fans are different than a lot of other types of gamers and I say that having done a World of Warcraft podcast for several years which you guys all know Hoard House was on the network okay so I was a part of that community and it's a great community I'm not talking negative at all I'm just saying that the blizzard fans are very loyal to blizzard products and when blizzard does this is why I realized that even though not everybody gets it like why destiny 2 is in the battle net launcher it's a brilliant move by Activision to sell more destiny 2 on PC to an audience that probably didn't check it out on console I mean I'm I'm sorry you may not like totally understand that but the way the the blizzard crowd is if they can spend the money that they're making on gold in World of Warcraft or what have you on destiny to another game they're gonna do it so like that was that was a move that was frankly brilliant by Activision I mean whether it's not the nice thing to do or not but anyway Activision's been aggressive pretty bad with this stuff and not only me even before destiny 2 with Call of Duty modern warfare remastered they just injected loot boxes in there it's like that what the fuck the original game didn't have that and now of course I'm assuming with the new Call of Duty and with advanced warfare I think even has that system shadow of war was a pretty big one that they just kind of added this up in there and then of course the one that released Italy got people pissed off it will force up the new force the game has that which is more of like a pay-to-earn type scheme but then the more of a pay-to-win type scheme with battlefront 2 member valve for it too they're like oh hey yeah we're gonna release all these maps for free it's you're not gonna we're not just gonna sell you really shitty base game and then force you to buy all the maps now we're gonna offer it to you for free but of course then they're gonna throw in this loot box system that's got a lot of mods that actually do affect gameplay you know something if you actually level up and that is actually I believe the system to level up in the game is tied to the loot boxes so it's unavoidable that's really really similar to overwatch overwatch does the free maps the free characters and as you level up you get loot box no I it's the other way around oh you don't level up get loot boxes you have to get loot boxes to level oh that's that's a little yeah that's like a little what can we change to be a little shadier and okay interesting so I do want to get some comments in our shower because I know you have some news like why are we bringing this up tonight loot boxes are nothing new in the gaming community but there's definitely some activity we're seeing this week but I want to get to our chat over at live dot vog network comm a stoppie and chat says I used to have no opinion on it but yes I'm seeing a lot of instances now where content seems to be cut out and held hostage in loot boxes let's see Carson says I like the loot boxes that do boxed CE and LE version of PC games but they're too expensive for me dungeon buster says loot boxes are just extensions of the mobile model thanks mobile gaming kaijuto and chat says the reason why they only do cosmetic is because we don't like pay-to-win look at what's going on with 2k 18 loot boxes have been going around since we had browser games but it certainly does feel like you know browser games I think are kind of one thing because browser games are free to play mobile games are free to play right but overwatch was $60 yeah that's not even this and it's not well oh right I know I'm only picking on a watch no watch is a good example because I think it's done correctly I don't think there's really an issue there because it's it is strictly cosmetic for me I don't give a shit about the cosmetic stuff so it's it's cool to get one every now and then it's like oh that's a pretty cool skin I'm not like oh man I really got it like but you know there's people that are like that but there are kind of on them right and wait how you choose to spend your money which if you want to buy a hundred loot boxes so you can get that symmetric dragon skin well hey it is a pretty sweet skin but with that though I mean there's definitely been a lot of people that have been opposed to it because yeah it is something that's kind of out that whole free-to-play model but you paid $60 for the game and then because it's not really the full game because you need all the DLC because that's been sliced out of the game as well so you to pay for the season pass as well and then they want you to pay for these loot boxes or paid modifications as Bethesda likes to do with you oh hey this modification is it happens to be 800 you know virtual currency points or whatever but you can only buy the currency points in 750 so you really have to spend $15 you get to get this other thing it it's just they tried to like cheat people in the best way possible because they they know they make money and they know well these fans of the game they're just gonna they're gonna be fine with it because it's just okay though they'll be annoyed but they'll still buy the game and yeah that seems to be the case with a lot of like destiny 2 players they're fine with it because they the game is good but you know the loot boxes are still there attempting people miss dark Sakura over there in the fluffy chair I'm curious on your hot take on loot boxes because I know you don't really do overwatch but you have done mobile games you've done Mass Effect had him yeah Dragon Age had him so what's your hot take on loot boxes are you okay with them are you kind of I'm okay that I don't multiplayer that much in overwatch makes me sick so it's not my problem right but what about the other games you do play that have them what games do I play that have those effects I don't do multiplayer in it anymore okay and I never did multiplayer in Dragon Age okay so okay I thought you kind of did more loot boxes back when like Mass Effect 3 was I did it for Mass Effect 3 but I didn't pay for any of them it's not always multiplayer games either shadow of war and granted it has a multiplayer aspect to it but right it's in the single-player right well she doesn't have needed to be fair neither do I yeah I none of this it doesn't matter to me okay I mean the only loot boxes I care about is the Pusheen loot crate oh you mean physical loot box right well this tangible stuff you know what actually let's talk about that because doesn't this phenomenon kind of exists in the real world any no okay any convention I go to any of them always have for sale those little question mark bricks that for like 20 bucks and they say two of them have a NES classic or something really highly desirable in them the rest of them have bullshit unload overstock stuff but because it's nerd stuff nobody really gets upset because they're like okay yeah that's like a raffle or gambling it's an I am Groot ruler something you know it's oh I needed a ruler but yeah I mean so there's been a lot of like kind of pushback with loot boxes because of all I mean recently there's just been a ton of games tons of big games coming out of it all have them and all kind of unnecessarily have them basically so what's some of the stuff going around this week if you don't mind so of course you know they've turned to the different ratings boards to kind of get their hot take on it as well the ESRB says you know they don't consider loot boxes to be gambling they just you know it's because I think mainly you don't actually you know win money from it you they don't see it as something of like value you're not really like it's it's not the same format as gambling basically they say yes our B does not consider loot boxes to be gambling while there is an element of chance in these mechanics the player is always guaranteed to receive in-game content even if the player unfortunately receives something they don't want we think of it as a similar principle to a collectible card game sometimes you open a pack and get brand new holographic card you had your eye on for a while but other times you'll end up with a pack of cards you already have so they're saying that because you get something each time it's not really considered gambling I think they make a darn good point with the fact that magic the gathering isn't considered a gambling and it's a similar type of deal yeah I can support that I mean you're right like you can't turn around and sell you know Blizzard walked away from that Diablo 3 auction house a long time ago and they don't really have anything like that in any of their other games maybe if something like that still existed and I mean I know Diablo 3 doesn't do loot boxes but let's make believe it did you know then maybe that would be gambling because you could turn around and sell the stuff that you get in the blue boxes that doesn't exist to be clear that doesn't exist but could could could it in five years is that like is that how we're gonna get out of it comp being gambling is that you're saying that you always get something well you know what if what you get is essentially worthless it it is it is a game of chance but it's not gambling there's a difference again magic the gathering isn't gambling right so and you know but but that analogy is absolutely right in magic the gathering you're not gonna get Sarah Angel it's like the one card I can't remember the name of you're not gonna get a Sarah Angel every booster pack just because you want one in fact you might buy like some of my friends did in high school that we all played you might buy 20 packs trying to get a hypnotic specter oh no that I did am I have my nailing these carny has been a long time I just don't originate or sitting there screaming or a shivin dragon my magic knowledge is is in the pooper or you know back in the black border days oh I got a Lotus let me did you play like a black I bet you played like a black deck black like my tournament deck was a black deck with Lord of the Pit and hypnotic specters I had a black white and red deck my tournament deck I found out I played it just to find out that it actually got banned the next tournament oh shoot I made it like fourth place okay all right well there you go see we and we weren't gambling at all all right and then of course Peggy they have their approach you know basically saying our approach is similar that of the SRB I think all ratings board do you SK in Germany as well the main reason is for that we cannot define what constitutes gambling that is the responsibility of the National Gambling Commission our gambling content descriptor is given to games that simulate or teach gambling as it's done in real life casinos racetracks etc have Gambling Commission were to state that loop boxes are a form of gambling then we would have to adjust our criteria to that interesting so this is about the advisory and why a game like Vegas Stakes on the Super Nintendo let's say because I don't know why but it's the first casino game that comes to my mind probably because it's still one of the best of this day Vegas Stakes would get a gambling warning because if you remember that game it was about you actually played blackjack you played crap what were the games in that it was like blackjack craps slot machine I remember they were like fuck you know maybe it was like five games in there I remember that was the one where like random people would come up to you while you're playing the game and there would be like the little like that's what kind of made it unique is that there'd be the little like they'd say oh can you help me by giving me a hundred dollars or whatever and sometimes they'd it was that was gambling too sometimes you'd they'd come back or they'd run away forever you never see the money again sometimes they'd be like I won a lottery and thing and I'm gonna give you part of the prize because you helped me and you made more money you remember that game no anyone Jamie you know the old classic games very well Vegas Stakes Super Nintendo remember that I didn't play it I swear to God next time you're gone classic I don't I don't like gambling really so being that you know the ESRB and Peggy can't really rule on it some other sites have taken to make a more you know apparent approach against this basically saying listen we're gonna take a stand against this we're not really you know for it let's make a way that we can make people aware of this so one of those sites that's taking aim at this is open critic and they're actually looking into ways that they can basically display what kind of loot boxes are in a game your weather game has loot boxes you know if it's pay to win that type of stuff what about the whole thing and I know you don't really have an answer for this but I know a couple months ago on the show we were talking about how China was pushing an issue where because you know overwatch is doing well there too but China was gonna make them publish what the percentage was of rare because we kind of don't know like what the percentage is like what is the chance that you're gonna get symmetrous dragon skin you don't know like you just know that sometimes rare stuff shows up but China was gonna make them publish the numbers but then I think I heard that recently blizzard found a way around it like they now you buy currency in the game and that's all you're spending money on you use the currency to get loot boxes or something like that like they're able they're able to get around they got around it somehow in China exactly we still don't know what those rates they were the making sort of gambling laws regarding loot boxes they would just change the way that they're doing so they can skirt around them so that's one site at least that's looking to do that but let me let me ask you this let me ask you this hard question and everybody in chat as well would you base your decision on if you're gonna buy a game or not on whether it has loot boxes and I asked that to our chat as well live fog network calm while I asked Loki and depends what kind of blue boxes if it's gonna be like you know overwatch where it's just cosmetic stuff for multiplayer then yeah I'm fine with that if it's something that's gonna be basically heavily involved in the game like shadow war or Forza or you know some of these that have basically in one game you've had it you know as a feature now it's a consumable and you that features gone because it's locked behind loot boxes where it seems like a you know massive cash grab from the publisher then no I probably would avoid the game just fucking wait for Nintendo to decide they're gonna start doing loot boxes I guess I kind of do they in the mobile games I I bet this Animal Crossing mobile does loot boxes just you wait that's fine once again that's yeah it's a free game you know what you're you're paying nothing for the game they can throw whatever the fuck they want at you I mean honestly that's it's my that's my opinion if if it's a free game you're playing you're losing nothing if you quit that game it's it the problem comes to like if it's Super Mario Odyssey and everything is locked behind a loot box then I'm gonna be fucking pissed because I paid $60 for the game so this metacritic or open critic or whatever was you said was looking at the advisories they need to probably clarify what kind of loot box it is besides just putting out a loot box warning like there because there's a difference between cosmetic only loot boxes and or if it's like a loot box that's in you know with in-game currency that you earn in the game you don't pay real money for dungeon buster just brought that up in our chat room saying the new Assassin's Creed game has that you can buy them but you can also use in-game currency and they've been very clear to say you can use in-game currency to buy the loot boxes right well that's you can do that and I think shadow war as well but you know of course they're gonna make the in-game currency hard to get and you know take forever and yeah tiger call on chat says these so-called loot boxes seem to only apply to multiplayer games you won't see loot boxes on single-player games was that the well shadow or the shadow war technically does have a multiplayer portion but the the thing though is most of that is meant for the single player game like in the end of the game it's very grindy and that's where that comes into play but yeah it just so happened me most games nowadays are they have a multiplayer portion to them right so it's gonna be hard to find a game that doesn't but like some of the games that they mentioned NBA 2k 18 has them you know I remember Oh Bobby Blackwell says fours of seven has loot boxes a single player yes so maybe this trend is yeah continuing and some folks in chat you know Rama dungeon buster both saying no this would not influence their decision dungeon buster elaborating I don't like the trend is represented in battlefront 2 but not all games implement loot box rewards the same way so hmm and dungeon buster saying I've been playing shadow of war and have not opened a single loot box I agreed but not checkmarked the legal agreement at the start interesting okay so I mean and to be fair I can't really judge the loot boxes and shadow war because I'm not playing that game oh yeah they said that most of the game you don't really need you know the loot boxes are really you can use them but it's not gonna be like super important it's just towards the end of the game the endgame stuff that to get the true ending you're gonna really need to level your characters because it's really hard to defeat the last or you know stave off the last few raids or whatever and that's where it becomes more tempting to get the true ending so speaking of loot boxes now we had some continued development and shadow of war actually right so now this is one of those things that doesn't surprise me how the player base is responded right Loki yes so of course you know with anything that people don't like they're gonna hack it they're gonna mod it so that's what happened apparently they have found a way to get loads of the Mirian which I guess is the in-game currency to keep buying loot chests forever and so I guess there's I'm using like just basic programs like the cheat engine allow you to get the in-game currency so that's not unexpected hackers gonna hack no patch it over put some anti-cheat yeah isn't the economy or whatever you want to call it like already kind of hosed I'm really surprised it is like because blizzard somehow seems to have never had this happen but I would assume like blizzard games pretty much at this point have to always be connected that's the other thing about blizzard games blizzard breaks all these rules that you'd like you know oh the community is never gonna allow that our community's gonna push back on this blizzard gets away with it every every damn time blizzards up on that stage Oh Diablo 3 you're so beautiful right you're a model but you look like Linda eventually stuff right exactly problem with Diablo 3 beam online only I mean when the servers weren't working but there's so how long did that last how long did that last people give we forgave and forget we forgave I forgot the the auction house controversy and maybe I'm part of the problem I love Diablo 3 now I love it now this is just online passes all over again because they're gonna make the excuse that we need extra money to run our games up you know what you make tons of money because you're not paying your fucking employees enough you're not paying you know the royalties to people that like they would get in other industries so stop fucking complain mm-hmm and to be fair to blizzard I think and I think this is important to say ask somebody who is a blizzard fan and plays a lot of blizzard games I think part of the reason they get away with like overwatch is always online and there's really nothing you can do about it is because they make fucking quality aims like blizzard doesn't really make bad games at least not my opinion I mean they misfired with Diablo 3 but they did what they had to do to fix it you know what I mean like that's that's how blizzard gets away with it so just you know to be clear blizzard gets away with it because they make fucking rock-solid games everybody wants to play so anyway is there anything else on loot box I thought we have one other little tidbit no that was it oh is it okay well there you go so yeah loot boxes in games there you go I think we will move on into our gaming weeks but first a little I'll do housekeeping first real fast we are not going to be here and actually my co-hosts are gonna hear this for the first time but I've been saying this for a couple weeks that we probably won't be here Veterans Day weekend we're definitely not gonna be here Veterans Day weekend because I am definitely going to be out of town so Alan and I decided we're gonna go Seattle cuz we want to it like Southwest had a big sale so we got tickets like 80 bucks to Seattle so why not that's pretty good right it's a pretty good price right we were looking at some other places but it was still a lot of money for Chicago and I think we're looking at Vegas and but Seattle was like dirt cheap so we're like let's do it we we went to Seattle for our five-year anniversary we had a great time so and I know a couple people up there so we'll go back and do some of the stuff we didn't do the first time so there you go so for that reason we will not be having a show Veterans Day weekend and that is November 13th I think cuz veterans do we live why oh no we fly back on the 13th November 12th is the date of the show so no show that day all right we're gonna move in to our gaming weeks and talking about the types of games we have been playing this week dark soccer stepped out for just a moment so I'll go ahead and start with Loki and how was your gaming week I didn't play too much unfortunately because I had planned to play a bunch of things but I once again am still stuck with being obsessed with Legos and not necessarily building Legos I've been actually doing stuff when one of the why started with a Lego digital designer and then I moved on to this other program called stud I O which allows you to manipulate things a little bit better than the Lego digital designer because they don't let you just drop bricks in there in certain ways so I was been messing with that but I did play some games I picked up because I've been checking like we have a target near or by and so they always have stuff in clearance like the other day I didn't pick it up because I already have enough instruments at home they had Guitar Hero the new one with a guitar it's like 20 bucks oh shoot yeah we're at Target like yeah the Rancho shit I might go buy that it wasn't there last time I went there last but last time I went there they had well one of the games I did pick up this week so I haven't played it yet but I've been getting more VR games so I picked up they had a couple things digitally on sale so I got the PlayStation worlds game because that was selling to like 10 bucks and then I also picked up oh god what was the other one there's another VR game that drive club VR because I think that was also down like 10 bucks so I picked those up and digitally and then Eagle flight which is that weird Ubisoft game they had it for $12 so I picked that up as well because it looks fun so they had that I was mainly looking for because they're closing at one time the Lego dimension stuff and I wanted to get some of those sets cuz they're down like five I still need to get that Midway set before it disappears I really want yeah it's gonna be hard to find I mean I saw it in a store not that long ago I did see the Toys R Us and they had him at the Targon sunrise if I remember correctly okay I because I look at that stuff every time I go in how can you not well yeah cuz I'm like because they've been marking them down like occasionally I'll see deals it like $1 I'm like oh damn I want that so there's like a routine so you know our pal Shane my pal Shane that I hang out with all the time who hosts a show here on the network called Ranger pride they're on a little hiatus right now but they'll be back Shane likes to go and if you listen to Ranger pride you know he likes to go looking for all the toys right so sometimes he'll con me into going on a toy hunt because it'll be like well let's just go on a toy hunt that will do lunch or something like that and so you know we'll have ourselves a fun Saturday morning so we have a routine like we go to Toys R Us and we look for the Power Ranger thing he's looking for and then we always go we look at amiibos we look at video games like we just have a like a habit of all the sections in the store any stuff mark down I almost picked up they had some of the Finding Dory stuff there and I was like man my kids would really like that but we have too many of those figures they don't play the game and my wife would be pissed if I pick more these up so I'm like yeah I'm just gonna not yeah they don't play it you send them to Bobby Blackwell if he plays but I knew they had a Doris if I hadn't seen it in any of the stores and now they have it there you go yeah go ahead and pick it up anything else for your gaming week um just the usual clicker game although I'm starting to get very tired of it so I don't know how long we continue with that I mean I Pokemon go maybe a thing they'll be start up again for a little bit but yeah I'm just like it's gotten to be more of like a chore and it's just there's like no point to it anymore I just kind of yeah why am I wasting my time with this well I'll lead it to my gaming week that and say I've been playing a little Pokemon go uh I don't I don't I don't view it as a chore like well I will say this like you know the one thing I want to do in Pokemon go and I think you kind of have to choose like what are your goals and Pokemon go do you want to raid gyms all the day and control the gyms do you want you know to collect all the Pokemon and level them all up or what so I really want to fill out the pokey decks right so right now in Pokemon go this month is where the anti raids are happening which one of the legendaries but like it is like the raiding activity has died off significantly from when it was the legendary birds and from when it was Raikou last month now I'm not saying Pokemon go is dead but Pokemon go is certainly not what it was over the summer or even just taking a nap it's it's yeah siesta a little siesta I'd say it's probably like dropping off faster as it goes long instead of it kind of taking a while to kind of dip it's going a lot faster so I was legit worried like I was not gonna find a group to get an Entei and I have a little chat we use a chat program called group me for some of the local people here and so usually when raids happen and last month like raids every day every night this month once in a while but like they don't happen every day so and I'm not available every day so I have to be careful sometimes so we tried to go do something a couple nights ago I didn't get Entei on the first go but today we went to a local park over here that has two gyms and by coincidence they both had Entei at the same time and so we got to do two Entei raids back-to-back and I did catch an Entei at one of those raids so and it was like this big sigh of relief like whew I'm not gonna miss it because I was so next month my lesson is learned I need to be out there day one which is what that's gonna be like Halloween to go out and get the ice dog or I can't remember the name as something but the ice dog I have to go up make sure I go out get day one because that's gonna be the easiest day to do it so I was get a little worried but you know I still Pokemon go is still a good way to gamify my walks like Fitbit kind of gamifies a lot with walking Pokemon go kind of does that because it's like oh I can hatch eggs and I still you know I could still make some good Dragonite you know use candy for things there's things and eggs you get a lot of stardust from that so it's kind of like you know I'm not like obsessed with Pokemon go but it's a nice little distraction and incentivizer for me to make sure I get up on my lunch and actually walk outside the building as opposed to sit and play on the internet the entire lunch in my office and then whoops lunch is over and I got to get back to work you know it's a nice way to make sure like I get out and get moving so yeah so I have some I have been playing a little bit of Pokemon go guys you know in chat over at live.vog network.com says it's in trouble because players know the Russians used it to hack our election I how would they've used it to hack our election I don't remember what the story was but I think it was something about people naming their Pokemon to certain controversial terms and putting them in gyms and then taking pictures of it and spreading it on Facebook but I don't want to get heavy into politics but the reality is it ain't just Pokemon go they were messing with to try to influence the election we'll leave it at that I think I think that almost speaks to I know I based my election choices but on the names of Pokemon and gyms I I think that just speaks volumes about what a cultural phenomenon Pokemon go even was I mean think about it how many video games since Polybus have you heard about a government conspiracy to change our way of life like it's been a while so anyway yeah that's what it was thank you Bobby Bobby's kind of echoing what I'm saying they didn't hack the app itself but it was an ad campaign with people naming their pokemons anyway other comments on Pokemon go and chat SSG100Matt says we had 30 people rating for an Entei at a random mall in Connecticut we were shocked because this mall was in the middle of nowhere okay so maybe my 30 people in Connecticut that's not bad so maybe my experience is different let's hit Bobby Black Wolf jokes about Pokemon go it fainted and it will never wake back up ever it didn't faint it might be down to like five hit points been faint other games I've been playing besides Pokemon go so I did a live stream of cuphead after the show last week and that was a lot of fun like it is it is a I love the art style the music the way the game feels like it's a solid platformer like I Jamie if you and Dan checked out Cuphead cuz I really feel like you guys haven't had a chance yet okay yeah I definitely at some point check it out I mean it's it's infuriatingly hard but like just I think you're gonna love like the art style of the presentation following it for a long time oh yeah it's been chatting with the developers from time to time on Twitter oh fun yeah yeah no um it's been on my list for a while it's just right now I'm still working on the convention guide for derpy con so that's been taking my spare time there you go I'll check on you with your full game a week in a minute let me let me finish up real quick so also uh let's see dungeon buster says you did great at cuphead Rob yeah thank you I did I I beat the tutorial so I got through that and I beat a few of the bosses on stream so um you know I I am allowed to continue to do a video game podcast I suppose after that but all that crap I'm saying that very tongue-in-cheek here's the funny thing about that you guys might get a kick out of this so I decided because I felt like that was a really good stream because I actually had a generous twitch person put like 86 viewers on me at one point so like I had quite a few people watching at the end so I feel like all that energy and a lot of people watching made it a really fun stream so I was like you know I don't do this with a lot of my streams I'm gonna put this one on YouTube so if you want to see the archive of the stream you can see it either on my twitch or you can see it on YouTube you know I waited 24 hours you have to do and then I put it up here's the hilarious part so within two days my YouTube has like 10 views because I wrote a tweet about it and 10 people clicked it and it gets flagged for copyright infringement by this company and I don't even remember the name of it was something like EBC maker EBCD makers only that was like what is I tried to google it I couldn't find anything I searched for tweets about it and there was only one other guy going these guys flagged my video and I was about to go off on YouTube and this whole cuz here here we go this whole thing where the people that make the videos just fucking get screwed by these people that come in and have no right to do so but I was like all right before you go off check what the rules on Cuphead are so I was doing my research and sure enough studio MDHR or whoever sorry if I messed up the acronym but the studio that made Cuphead has a page that very specifically says yes stream the games put the games on YouTube make money off them we don't care get it out there you know so I I filed an appeal I said oh hell no I filed an appeal I linked to that YouTube and so forth I will give YouTube credit when I sent my appeal they re-enabled the video right away and I think that's a change from what it was before so and it said the claimants have 30 days to respond and after a day the claim disappeared I never got an email saying that oh they accepted it or whatever but I fought the law and I won and it feels good early so far knock on wood but so far it's completely the claim is completely disappeared from my account so yeah take that I think if you counter then they the next step is they have to file an actual lawsuit or something yeah they don't own it so like but it's like they're not going to who the hell is this company and I'm like you know if the if the Cuphead studio had a page that said do not post the videos and monetize them I would have said well I don't have I don't have monetization anyway because my YouTube channel has 9960 views so I'm like just shy of 10,000 I had it at one point but I got turned away or whatever when they when they put the 10,000 view because I don't I don't honestly I don't use YouTube a lot I've really been trying to focus my efforts on Twitch but when I was at Dragon Con and on the podcast track I took some of the advice I believe it or not even though I didn't take all the advice like start a patreon to heart I took some of the advice like get your stuff out there on as many porn for platforms as possible I took that stuff to heart so I was like you know what I do need to be pushing more of my twitch stuff to YouTube so I was trying to do that and it was just funny that like this first video gets flagged and I have to fight it and all that stuff but the experience could have been worse I guess I'll leave it that way but if the studio had a page that said don't do it then I would have said okay my bad and I would have taken it down and just been like okay I won't do that again so but that was a lot of indie game studios don't give a shit yeah uh SSG100Matt in chat says yeah these BS video flaggers I have a friend who does YouTube full-time and he has to deal with this nonsense he often often has to request a manual review on these claims has anybody ever tried to like class action lawsuit these third-party companies surely that happened at some point with the bigger streamers I'm not gonna do that shit but people like sort of mark plier might be able to so it's not not really but like you know there is that whole case against Alex Mauer right now which is kind of wrapping up oh yeah thing so basically she had a certain chance to respond and she responded late and so now they are filing a motion the strike and all this stuff so it's almost over so when it does end up if if they do win it end up winning which they probably will then that does open it up to the fact that she was filing false DMCAs and they could file a class-action lawsuit against her for lost revenue because she did two hundreds that could be an interesting precedent too so be it'll be interesting to see what happens yeah because I mean it seems like anybody can file a claim and you don't have to be the copyright owner of it and you know it's gonna just fuck everybody over and what you you mean you could even just say low oh yeah and then you know you can some people do this they'll wait the 30 days that they have to appeal and so before they used to not get any revenue for that I think now it goes into an escrow account or something like that and then at the very last second they'll just say okay we're dropping our claim but that was 30 days you weren't getting revenue and by that time you know who's gonna see your video right so all right anyway um what else in my game away let me quickly say Final Fantasy 14 got a patch on Tuesday so I hadn't played in like a month but that was enough to get me to check it out again so I've been playing that a little bit and I'm gonna do a live stream tonight after the show Stardew Valley on Nintendo switch I'm gonna play that for the first time I played it on PC before but I honestly don't remember it at all it was like over a year ago and I played once and I don't remember it at all so I'm gonna but my Twitter has been lighting up with people who love Stardew Valley on the switch and I was like it's only 10 bucks because I already had leftover credit on my accounts I was like you know what let's do it I'm gonna buy Stardew Valley on switch so we're gonna play that after the show tonight so I think that's it for my game a week I've talked enough so Jamie we'll circle back to you sorry we missed you the first go-around but how was your game a week I'm playing Ragnarok online again officially on a free server did that whole little pouring clicky-click game make you want to go back yeah um it's like a quick leveling server so I'm already like rebirth level you know high thief or something oh sorry I'm eating a bagel um it got stuck in my teeth um I'm also of source still playing idle pouring and Pokemon go and that other oh yeah me Tomo um I put danganronpa v3 on hold because like I said I still want to stream it but it's gonna have to wait until I've got the con guy done which you know my deadline I thought was this weekend thankfully it's not but it's busy there you go that and other personal things going on I've still been busy too because I mentioned this last week I've still been busy with that Big Brother thing I talked about I wasn't first voted out so that's a victory for me because I thought I would be but it's still going so it's it's taking maybe 90% of the time it was so I have a little more time to do stuff but not a lot because just like my Skype is constantly going crazy from that game but it's it's fun and I'm meeting new people so yeah anyway that's it that's it for your gaming week that's it for all our gaming weeks I already talked about housekeeping and by the way Jamie no show veterans day weekend I dropped that on us for the first time Alan and I are going to Seattle have fun yeah thank you we will we I earned it dammit this has been a shit year I I am ready to fucking go to Seattle and have fun all right let's get to some gaming news Loki start us off would you yes so Nintendo is looking to get more adult games on the switch so that's kind of a change because you know before they used to kind of not put those types of games on there because the system is more of a family-friendly system but they seem to be kind of moving in the adult theme area as well so for example you know they're saying that games like doom you know Knights of Azure to brighter the new moon shinobi rifle centering kangaroo coming to switch of course is a little bit of a change because those are definitely more an adult-oriented game they're saying that you know I guess the creator of Galvin 2 actually was surprised by Nintendo's reaction to their pitch of releasing that game on their platform he said I thought it wouldn't be possible to release such a game for the switch but surprisingly Nintendo gave me positive feedback so it seems like they're a little bit more open to those types of games on there which is good because I mean honestly you have to catering to children's fine because there's plenty games to do that but you got to cater to as many people as possible so why not I mean I think already they're kind of taking steps in the right direction especially with this you know cross play and stuff all they need to do now is just get rid of those fucking friend codes and then you'll be on board I mean but it seems to move it in the right direction so more blood and more guts on the switch titties more titties on the switchy how about how about how about some dongs to make it fair all right sure thank you Loki I appreciate the blessing with that HD rumble you know you feel the dong in your hand there's a dick in my hand I don't think they vibrate unless you have like additives no accessory oh oh I see I see well you know there's a lot of it it's not supposed to vibrate it's like you know how they have the whole like you know ice cubes in the controller demo type of thing so you won't really vibrate it but like you would you shake the controller back and forth and you'd feel the weights of it flopping about you know flopping all right anyway well what we'll see maybe more adult games coming switch what about night trap because they've been re-released not everywhere night trap gonna come out on hot garbage so I don't know if we need that game I just feel like whatever it's adult games always comes back to night trap like the the og adult game what was that what was that game that was at e3 a decade ago feel three or feel three that's it feel three for the we offer the switch why not put like five nights at Freddy's I'm surprised that isn't on there already I'm kind of surprised too maybe it's maybe it's not as easy as you'd think too because he made it in some type of game maker program so maybe it's not as easy to port it over to the switch hmm but maybe it's inevitable at some point I also got a feel five nights at Freddy's might be a little bit past its prime probably but then again I mean fucking just in the past couple weeks we've had axiom verge and stardew valley and these games that have come out on plenty of other consoles even years ago and I feel like there's a lot of Nintendo fans that are kind of living these things for the first time well I mean you like I think with the Wii U was and they didn't really focus too much on Indies but like any scene that be able to have more visibility because there wasn't so much on the platform and I think that's kind of the same scenario with switches there's not a ton of things on the platform right now so you can get that visibility for your game and actually if there's you know those games coming out few and far between you definitely have more people looking at your game no that's a very good point I think Nintendo's really leveraged their e-shop a lot better this time and you can't say there aren't a lot of games on the switch right now I mean granted they're not a lot of triple-a titles but there's a lot of you know you can download digitally except not all the same time because your switch only has 32 gigs of storage that was really technically you can expand it technically didn't have to technically all right I shouldn't have to do that all right let's talk about Microsoft a little bit Microsoft you know the Kinect has kind of had one foot out the door for a little while now and you may not have realized but when the Xbox one s launched last year which is the smaller Xbox one which is the only Xbox one regular there's gonna be now there used to be a little adapter that you could get with it for free that would allow the Kinect to be used on this console it's basically a USB to connect adapter okay but that promotion you may not realize that ended in March this year so you can no longer get that adapter for free all those connect games are not gonna be able to play well just to be clear and the reason why I bring this up Xbox one X will not have a similar offer and that was confirmed by Aaron Greenberg executive for Xbox on a Twitter I can't believe we're confirming news via Twitter but here we are in 2017 Aaron Greenberg on Twitter said we provided free adapters for a good part of last year following the Xbox one s launch but that program has ended so well I don't think they're selling the Kinect anymore well to be fair is it completely discontinued it's probably harder to find you probably don't get a lot of shelter things that there but I bet you could probably go on Amazon and get one still right but a lot of it's gonna be used yeah I don't think they're selling anymore cuz I can't honestly name you I would assume just dance supports it but I think that is still assumption that's still an assumption maybe just like that they support the move controller but I don't think you need the move controller for anything right all phones but yeah I don't think there's not any games I can think of they're coming out it's like man that's a Kinect game like even those well okay now I take that back there is a couple games do support it but those are those re-released Kinect adventure games remember that they had like the Disney Adventure one that are coming out with controller support now but they still support Kinect because it's you know like an HD remaster okay that's like a very who gives a shit no one's looking for that I do want to point out Rama and chat says Microsoft is still selling the Kinect Brad actually provides the link to Amazon so there you go those yeah they I'm sure they got inventory that they want to move not an inventory you see in stores though so even though we're not gonna bury the Kinect yet the Kinect is certainly it's you know with the Xbox 1x they're not focusing on Kinect the message is 4k fucking beautiful gaming that's the message on Xbox one X that is not Kinect anymore so you know they're gonna keep pushing the beautifulness of games like four is a seven and crackdown three when it comes out next year and the other stuff that has the Xbox one I've already forgotten about crackdown three whoops yeah so I'd be curious to see how that little console does this holiday for Microsoft's gonna be very very interesting I think it do well I would assume either I just kind of worry that this well I don't know like definitely the Xbox one X has its audience I don't think it's gonna move the number of units that the switch does this holiday but does it need to maybe not you know the Xbox one X is a high-end piece of hardware I don't know how to move high-end types of numbers I'm sure it where the targets it'll do better one there's more 4k content out there because I think right now it's still very early it's kind of like where 3d TVs were for a while where they're really pushing that it was almost too early I mean the 4k TVs have been out for a while now it's just like is it necessary like do you really feel like that you need to upgrade or anything I don't feel like that yet I mean it would be a nice to have but it's not something I'm looking to go out and do right away until my TV dies and then yeah I'll get 4k TV then that's kind of where I'm at and remember I'd mentioned this after e3 it's like I'm excited to do 4k gaming on PC but even that I think you know the money that I probably would have spent on a 4k graphics card I just bought a vacation with so yeah that's probably gonna wait till 2018 or just take for guys okay oh don't do 4k do like 1440p or something like that and just drop it down a little bit and then you have like killer frame rate to go with it oh yeah enhanced everything that's kind of yeah like even or I can play like 2k still runs pretty decent on the car to yeah so that's probably what I'll end up doing so yeah and I can still do 4k movies and all that stuff just fine that I don't runs great on my my rig so you know I still I saw all that but yeah I'm probably just gonna wait a little bit on the gaming portion of that but um I I will say this the Xbox has now become my living room console because my PlayStation 4 got moved into the office so I could do more streaming with it I still play games on PlayStation 4 but I do my Hulu and CBS for Star Trek and all this I do all that on Xbox now I don't do it on PlayStation so just kind of an interesting shift I've been kind of having to use my Xbox more for that media stuff so I can watch on the TV in the living room and the experience has been fine so you know it's pretty easy to grab new apps and I do like I will give it is much easier if I were to say download episodes of RuPaul's Drag Race which I would never do but let's say I did like it's very easy to put them on a USB Drive and then plug that into my Xbox one and just play them right off that so which doesn't really work as easy on PlayStation 4 it's too bad I mean I get why they do it but it's too bad that they don't like partner like and this is not even necessarily any you know specific console but one thing I love on my Android TV box is the whole Google cast stuff because they have apps that they build specifically for that and I love the native apps but half of the native apps aren't available you just have to cast over to it but it works fantastic so I'm a little too well actually because my kids tablets it somehow knows that my TV things on our network and if they hit the button it casts to the TV and there's no way to block that so it's like you'll be watching TV also and some shitty YouTube children's things on there my god fucking damn it yeah turn that shit off anyway going to something else about Xbox and Microsoft to remember the original og Xbox the Xbox first Xbox VCR Xbox Uno those games are still gonna be backwards compatible at some point remember crimson skies hello anyway it is still coming Xbox head Phil Spencer reaffirmed in an interview with game spot it is happening saying we're close we're really close we're so close keep going anyway it should gene we should watch by the end of the year so by the end of the year you should be able to play things like crimson skies and fusion frenzy on your Xbox they're just using frenzy just blow a big bunch of games all over you all at once you know what props to them for actually working on backwards compatibility yeah it's like had I known this now when I was shopping for consoles I probably have an Xbox one instead of a PlayStation 4 hmm and it's just disappointing to see how little movement there is on that front with PlayStation it's just they want me to do their streaming service and no I don't want to do your streaming service Sony's getting a little cocky and it might you know it's gonna be interesting are we gonna go in the next in the next gym are we gonna flip back again it's gonna be well the reason why I'm saying Sony's getting cocky just people understand this whole of cross-platform gaming again I don't think it made our show tonight but there was another game out there I was reading a story about that they came out said well we'll be cross-platform on switch Xbox one and PC because Sony won't let us do it and I just Sony can only sit on top of that throne so long you know it's it's people remember that kind of crap mm-hmm mm-hmm all right let's let's hope they correct make a corrective course soon anyway let's move on we've been talking a lot of the first two stories so let's go over to Dark Sakura with what she has to report oh well I don't know if it's gonna be bad or good it could be good it could be like I said bad but humble bundle has been acquired by IGN as in you know the the gaming news slash strategy stuff you know website but anyway they said though that they chose IGN because they quote understand their vision that they think that they'll be able to help hunt a humble bundle continue with their quest for charity and good works through gaming so I hope I hope it stays good I hope hope hope they don't get screwed over in this so yay to register participation for this week's episode of orange island radio at vog network calm use the passphrase door as long as the charity support stays I think there will still be a lot of fans of humble bundle and I think you know again one thing that's gonna have to stay and I don't know how IGN feels about this but the ability to choose you know if you're gonna give money to charity or give money to developers or give money as a tip to the humble bundle itself to keep it going I know the default is usually like a third a third a third but you know if you want you can slide the bar and you just give all the money to charity and you know some people some people play with that maybe they'll give you know 40% to charity 40% to the developers and 20% to humble bundle you know sometimes people like to play with those numbers so I think as long as that stays there people won't get upset but like if the tip becomes required or something like that then that's where people are gonna start to abandon that chip real quick my only thing with humble bundle is that there's so many of them now so frequently that it's hard to keep tabs when good ones are out I wish it integrated more with steam so I could see which games I already own because there's like several humble bundles where like I just don't buy them because I have like half the games on them I mean it's nice to support charities and stuff but I don't need to buy stuff I already have act-deft in chat says I'm not really okay with IGN buying humble but at the same time I do think IGN can help them become bigger s2100 Matt says as long as IGN lets humble continue to do their thing I am okay but I'm extremely cautious about this stop he says I'm sure it was it's gonna change does anyone to remember the stories from a year or so ago when they were saying they couldn't afford to pay humble staff Bobby Blackwell says humble bundles lost their uniqueness they were better when they were just an event now it's just yet another digital storefront and that's boring you know what I hate to fucking bring this up but I'm gonna I'm gonna fucking bring it up it's exactly what's gonna happen to she's one sauce in the winner it's exactly what's gonna happen everybody's losing their fucking mind they're gonna try they're like wow that's not really good this stuff was nasty anyway and then when it comes out and it's it because now McDonald's fucking because of everything's happened they've come back to new a corner fucking publicity got the factory going overtime right now so that come November December they're gonna have that shit everywhere and then people are gonna try it they're gonna be like no wonder they got rid of this shit the first time it's like Crystal Pepsi kinda why can't they bring back Josta if they're gonna bring back something surge bring back surge I know they sell it on Amazon but why can't it be in store I bet you surge sucks too you know what is seriously delicious search was fucking awesome but they changed the recipe so it's not quite the same anymore but I still want I I have found I gotta work something from Amazon recent pretty soon so I'm gonna get surge with that I have found something that tastes like Josta by the way and they sell it at the Russian grocery store out in Citrus Heights it's like some guarana drink but it tastes just like Josta just saying noted that's just like I know I saw catch-up still was my stuff okay I saw ketchup chips for sale the other day ketchup is disgusting I had a very Canadian moment no why not I did order mushroom ketchup really you put it's an 18th century thing you put ketchup on your french fries mayonnaise french fries are a potato fuck that french fries you put ketchup on french fries or not your cheese why can't you put ketchup on potato chips it's they're both potatoes ketchup is disgusting ketchup is fine I almost feel about ketchup the way you do about mayonnaise potato chips in that case fine don't eat them but see you don't really put ketchup on potato chips I'm fine if you want to dip that shit you know that's fine or even the ranch or something that'd be fine but like I don't know if you should put on the chips or make your chips clearly with people's fucking obsession with ranch I don't know I think ranch is nasty in most scenario it's all about balsamic vinegar I knew a guy in college that bought ranch by the gallon and he would have the gallon fucking mug in the the refrigerator and would put it on everything when you dip it in the ranch like the internet like a soda Alan is here to lend us some witful insight now that he heard this the worst application of ranch dressing I've ever seen in my life was back in 95 96 senior year of high school when the cafeteria had the big Costco pumps of ketchup mustard and ranch and people would drizzle ranch on like they're like this shitty cardboard flat pizza that was like it was like it basically wasn't even cheese it was like it was like it was like the frosting top of a zinger doing Twinkie or just peeled it off so that so they would put ranch on that but the worst were the girls who got a Nissan cup of ramen put in the hot water and then put in four pumps of ranch so water down ranch in their cup of noodles that happened that's a travesty that happened 20 years ago 22 years ago and a tragedy so worse I've never looked at ranch the same way again I do like Hidden Valley Ranch you know if we're gonna get brand specific because oh no no more ranch discussion sorry Ken's brand is the best cool ranch and it's on a Dorito I want nothing Doritos are fucking gross all right and you can use them as fire kindling it's your story all right no Alan was just borrowing my mic for a minute artitsu we only have three in studio right now seriously yes Szechuan sauce is gonna be a fucking joke and I don't know why people were flipping did you hear someone traded one of those packets for a car I apologize for the listener to the listeners for bringing up Szechuan sauce on olr I was trying to make a point and look what fucking happened I will learn my lesson for next time and do better oh we go on tangents like that's this is the first time that's ever happened our 10 into the show Loki next story so you know as I mentioned I may be getting back into Pokemon soon that's because the new update has been data mined and we've found pictures for the Halloween event that's right there's gonna be some Halloween event which is not unexpected but along with that there's also trophy listings and badges for the third gen of Pokemon so third gen of Pokemon I'm probably gonna be here within two weeks or so it could be a limited start remember when Gen 2 released it was just the babies for the first yeah I don't think it's but I'm just saying don't be shocked if it's the ghost Pokemon only I do need some more ghost Pokemon though I'm pretty deficient in the ghost Pokemon area I don't think there's any like big heavy-hitting ghost Pokemon right now like maybe Gengar but you have to really power it up you know yeah so but yeah they're saying though there's a new loading screen and it has I guess teasing third generation Pokemon as well so they've got that's the most damning and yet dustclops, shuppet, bannet, dust skull and sableye so and then of course Gengar is on there but those might be the only Pokemon I'm just warning because I seem to remember when Gen 2 launched we got a loading screen with Pichu and Igglybuff and the babies that they let out originally so I'm just saying be prepared y'all that those may be the only Gen 3 Pokemon we get at first and then by December or whatever or no probably earlier than that by November Thanksgiving or something we'll have all the rest of Gen 3 but I'm glad we didn't have to wait an entire year it was only about eight months well can we fast forward to Alola already well that's what I'm saying it's like I think that the lull is going it's it's not dragging out as long anymore it's like people are kind of getting over it really fast and so they're gonna have to get those updates a lot faster yeah well I would say Niantic is still it's raining money over there because I'm sure with the raids you know there's still enough people doing them that they're making money you know right it's not kid ourselves but isn't it nice to make a lot of money and we still have Mewtwo raids to really I mean I know they've done a couple but they didn't really launch them big so I mean I still don't have Mewtwo which actually I'm kind of pressed about that because a lot of people I know do have them so I kind of like that to come back so I can try to catch another so we'll see though maybe that's something it's gonna launch around gen 3 I don't know so as 100 Matt thinks in our chat I think there will be more costumed Pokemon they did come out with this update about not being able to transfer costume Pokemon without an extra screen I thought that was always because we had that bug a month or two ago where the Pikachu's weren't showing their hats right yeah and so people like may accidentally throw them away but now you can't do that so that's great I'm so happy they put that in actually and then one other thing that they're doing also a little bit before this whole update that's allegedly this was happen this is Pokemon go photography contest so using the app you can actually take pictures of course of Pokemon and with the AR camera so they're basically having you kind of try to get the best spot or shot that you can and then share it on Instagram and tag it Pokemon go contest so you have until the 25th of October to do that and I guess they haven't really announced with the prize oh here we go so if you do win and this is used US residents only unfortunately the winner gets a bag containing a poster autographed by the team a pair of wireless Bluetooth earbuds and go plus so it's kind of alright can I submit old photos because I have a picture of a Paris on the grill at Benihana that I still think is funny probably I mean that would be fun and fine I might try that definitely don't do anything you would see in the Pokemon go our Pokemon go gone wild community oh god that is unfortunately a thing oh god is it a tumbler it's a reddit subreddit I'm sure it's a tumbler thing as well but yes if you want to see you know Pikachu sitting on dudes dick there you go camera of course people are gonna take pictures or sticks with it okay wait you said it's a reddit it's a reddit yes I think it's like Pokemon go gw or gone wild Pokemon gone wild maybe I don't know like Pokemon go gone a while or something what's the most horrible horrible thing you've seen on there I don't know it's just it's pokey gone why oh it's I went to the sub and it says nothing there they flushed it I don't know do I need to log in I doubt it there I search this now let chatter I know what so I know somebody out there knows it y'all need better hobbies it's a Pokemon go gone wild I think Pokemon go NSFW that's what it was okay thank SSG 100 Matt news it the award for biggest perv goes to because it's it got a camera and so people are gonna do that I'm looking at a picture of an Eevee next to a naked lady why why not and then here's a picture of a horsey sitting on a guy's Wang that's I'm glad I I'm glad I logged into the internet today if it exists it can be porned if it's got a camera you're gonna get porn out of it SSG 100 Matt says wow throwing me under the bus just because I Google it faster than you I just I expect Tiger Claw to have the best Google food skills sorry SSG 100 Matt I guess there's some things even Tiger Claw won't Google and I don't blame you for that I don't blame you for that there's a lot of money person with morals in this room yes no you don't have them either come on girl I have morals I'm just not interested in that kind of garbage come on no Gus and chat says Rob's gonna be up all night yeah crying all right hey you must be this tall to enter all right I do I just doesn't you know morals have nothing to do with the dirty mind all right moving on let's talk about him fortnight because I have if you're gonna be up to fort all night over on a gadget they had a story that caught my eye is talking about a fortnight lawsuit because I know a lot of people are playing the fortnight battle royale online well apparently epic games has filed a civil lawsuit against two people they say are cheating while playing online and they're doing it through a website called addicted cheats which apparently this website it's subscription based and you can on this website use their services to hunt down and kill twitch streamers while they played live what a bunch of dicks what a dick bag thing to do yeah people like doing it but that's usually they know it's usually they have a delay on it and a lot of twitch streamers can put like a 30-second delay so it doesn't matter interesting but so anyway I what epic games excuse you have a cease pardon me blessing I'm allergic to bullshit are rated stuff with epic game says in the suit that individuals had to dive in and modify fortnight's source code and able to do this and this violates the EU LA and the DMCA that of course being the License Agreement and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act so anyway epic is not suing the site to get it off the internet it's suing the two individuals for copyright infringement that can carry a penalty up to a hundred and fifty thousand dollars these two defendants are technical support for addicted cheats calm so it looks like epic games may be trying to make an example out of them in the complaint one defendant was banned from fortnight nine times continue to make new accounts to continue playing accused of using specifically the addicted cheat site to hunt down popular players while live streaming which I guess is a whole prat is a whole part of the dark web no dark web thing they just do that the dark web yeah called a stream sniping and that is forbidden in the code of contact for player unknowns battlegrounds which is why the guy got banned nine times so anyway that would be interesting also addicted cheats has taken that cheat offline saying it's closed for a legal issue there you go come on no Gus and chat says addicted cheats is that like an Ashley Madison site something let's see stop Ian chat says how do you even find individual streamers apparently this site would let you do it this site somehow goes to the code and and will put like in their game people would normally do is they'd have a stream on at the same time and they try to get in the same game as a streamer and they kind of figure out based on where they see them right you know but then you have that's that's really easy to do if you have like a short delay it's the whole look it's the whole rule of golden I you don't fucking look at my screen to figure out where I am you keep your eyes on a damn screen we're just like why waste your time doing that I mean I guess if you think if you're just trolling I guess you might be easily amused by that kind of stuff but that just seems dumb yeah in case you don't kind of brings up in chat saying can't someone just do that looking at someone's stream yes but you can't really force your way into their game and I'm assuming this website kind of facilitates you being able to make sure you get matched with them no I don't know I don't know what that would do I don't know what it does because I would not use such a site this would like show like say the usernames from like a longer distance away so they can see oh this is where this person is and they it's like a wall hack almost where you can see the person through the walls and so you can see where they are just goes make a beeline you know a lot about this Loki well I've been playing games for a long time I have to all right moving on speaking of she who has been playing games for a long time dark soccer we have for us I have some stuff about blizzard sue in the pants off people because it's not you know the the 2000 teens without having you know one company sue another and in this case blizzard is suing a and actually its partner oversees neaties I think it's called net ease are suing developers of a game called heroes of warfare the developers for three nine nine and they are they put out what they called the first MOBA on iOS or Android they have you know stylized characters with checkpoints on maps that's similar layouts like in overwatch and certain sound effects that sound like they've been pulled directly from overwatch as well as a very similar UI so yeah Blizzard's like I know you didn't and decided to lay the smack down financially on this Chinese company which I mean we get a lot of clones I think you know trying to make money off of successful IPs but in this case I was looking at some of the video of it it looks pretty pretty similar I mean the biggest difference is platform but I don't know it's cute I mean you still make me it's probably still make me sick you still can't put Super Mario Brothers on the iPhone unless you're Nintendo just because it's a change in platform right yeah that whole type of thing yeah so so so they're getting their their butt sued that's what you get come up with an original idea it'll be interesting to see how it turns out because this practice is very common not just in China if you go on to you know Apple Store or Google Play you're gonna find tons of clones of games Russian hackers gonna hack look look at look when flappy bird came out some dude made a game called flappy vog it was such a ripoff I'm just I'm teasing obviously I think a ton of people did and for one flappy vog speeds up as you play which the original doesn't do so it does have a key difference but anyway all that stuff aside I mean there's all these types of you know ripoffs but there's a big difference probably between something like flappy bird and you know cuz again I'll you know kidding aside these other knockoffs usually don't have a bird it's flappy something else you know a flappy podcast hosts or whatever but you'd usually don't like copy art assets down to you know what's really indistinguishable from other games I don't know those pipes sure did look like super mario bros pipes that's true that's true oh how funny I never knew this Bobby Blackwell and chat says fun fact I have never actually played flappy bird when I made flappy vog I just saw a video or two well I take comfort in knowing I have probably one of the last phones left they can still play flappy bird because I still not on iOS 11 you know what what never played flappy bird flappy bird happy bird yeah never played flappy bird there's probably a reddit for that to do another story Loki so we talked a little bit about loot boxes earlier and that's kind of one way developers and publishers I think publishers are more involved with this piece out parts of games that would normally be included in the full price of the game well another practice to do that as well is pre-order bonuses that's right and so it's there was a specific online web advertisement from the wonderful folks at the evil G that were advertising the pre-order bonus for Assassin's Creed origins and so it kind of pissed off people a little bit because it basically showed this camel jump up in the way it's like sorry the bonus mission is blocked unless you pre-order Assassin's Creed origins because you know it's sort of playing or making fun of the whole pre-order culture but being that this company is the one that kind of perpetuates that pre-order culture some people weren't so sensitive to or weren't as happy to see that in an advertisement blatantly just saying kind of like yeah we know what's wrong with fuck you guys pre-ordered this shit you know so that's the thing apparently though I've from what I've seen is they've kind of taken this ad offline so you can't really find it anymore but do you think there were some angry gamers around this probably people get angry over a lot of things but it is kind of angry people on my yes yes on your internet it's more real than you think I just but yeah it is kind of shitty the block a mission behind a pre-ordered you know DLC thing that's why you wait for the game of the year edition you know mm-hmm late gamers all right well hopefully you won't have to wait too long to pick up this game because it's a blizzard game so you know they do good stuff as we were talking about earlier apparently it's a new overwatch game that they may be working on this is huge rumor and it's based off the fact that a vacancy on the blizzard jobs website says that they are looking to expand overwatch with a generalist artist intern with knowledge and understanding of overwatch to work on a unannounced project well shoot that could be anything because that could be like a mobile type of game or something you know certainly will make a lot of sense if blizzard wanted to use the overwatch IP on mobile somehow over watches the overwatch hmm let's see it's also brought up that a while ago last year over on neo gaff somebody had found a listing for a lead software engineer for a first-person title and Mike Morehame has confirmed in the past there are teams working on new projects especially on mobile so it really could be anything I wouldn't mind seeing a new overwatch game in a couple years but I really like the stuff like Junkenstein's revenge and the PvE type of stuff especially when they did the uprising I think was an overwatch uprising I like those types of events and the Junkenstein event by the way you know I know we're joking about loot boxes but if you are an overwatch player don't forget to sign in and get your Halloween loot box and do the Junkenstein uprising because it's not that hard and you get a loot box from that too and in fact if you do it like nine times you can get like three more loot boxes you can get a lot so yeah get your loot boxes then you don't have to buy them for your cosmetic crap sure but yeah a new overwatch game I'd be into it but I see where blizzard maybe wouldn't want to cannibalize the overwatch they have now so it would have to be something maybe a little different but I think an overwatch PvE type of game would be awesome so we'll see all right well let's travel back to a simpler time we're gonna travel back to a time when there was no loot boxes there was just in fact if something was wrong with this cartridge like if the boss was just missing on level 30 too fucking bad you dealt with it you didn't have loot box you had a recall you had a hacked passwords yeah seriously so we're gonna terror horror danger exclamation point and Justin Bailey our classic game of the week the dark soccer is gonna step into the gaming vault find a game that she thinks hey you little brats give me all the money you are gonna give the loot box people and go play this classic game instead because it has no loot boxes and you can still play this game for like 60 hours oh yeah this game is at least 60 hours of joy this is a great pick too it's one again here again how long have we been doing this segment like almost 500 classic and this is a game that I started and never spent much more time on I really really wish that I had and this is one of those games where I'm like how is how have we not done this before right now so anyway this is the classic game is Terranigma which in Japan was called a tenchi sozo which means the creation of heaven and earth it was released in 1995 by enix with character designs done by a mangaka named Fujiwara Kamui Kamui sorry it was released in English in the UK it was also released in German French and Spanish but never released in North America which is a fucking travesty because this game I mean even a little bit I played of it was really good you know it was just you know a little bit more of my own gamer a DD and no SSJ 100 mat Julian is never picking halo because I'm only the my words the final word the buck stops with me yeah then I kick it in the ass so basically the game has a top-down perspective over the world it is an action-based real-time battle system to where you do different techniques depending on with your if you're running jumping attacking or using a combination of the actions but each attack will have different ways it can hurt different enemies and so you get experience you know it increases your stats you get you know whatever dead enemies leave behind like oh look the squirrel left me a compound bow that's interesting where did the scroll keep the compound but you know bow up its ass compressed highly compressed you also have you know spells and then different things that boost spells and the series that you can click these things called magic rocks that you take them to a magic shop and have them transformed into rings and summons so kind of like early materia system too if you think about it but the thing that I always thought was cool about this game was the world it was built in is that you have a fictional earth that is a hollow sphere so you have the people that live on the surface and the people that live on the internal face of it so light side dark side and then two different forces that rule them on the top it's the ability to evolve and exceed and on the dark side it's decline so that creates two forces called God and devil which I guess people in America have their you know head so far if their asses over anything with vague religious symbolism so whatever the fuck and then like the last battle takes place in Antarctica so but it's it's a really really neat game it has really great music and of course it was done by annex just a really gorgeous game put out for the Super Famicom Super Nintendo and the company that that created it was quintet who I'm sorry the development company was quintet who also designed Actraiser and Soul Blazer you know illusion of Gaia an annex basically commissioned them a subcontractor and wanted an action role-play game so that's how it happened so basically the the founder of quintet wrote the script for the game and the scenarios had to be approved and it was just really a lot that went into it they they had a little bit of I'd say early CG in it you know for designing the graphics for the resurrection scenes and just pretty pretty crazed me crazy but it was never published in North America because annex closed its US subsidiary before the localization was finished so the English versions were used that were made for America were released in Europe and Australian when Nintendo had it ready to go so it also had like a lot of merchandise that came out with it including a guidebook a World Atlas and a novel and also another novelization of the game full other art books in two manga based on it to full sorry a two volume manga that was based on it and these have never been released outside of Japan although Club Nintendo did a 32 page comic that came out in Germany the soundtrack of course has been released in 1995 and it had the first six tracks were arranged versions the game music it sold pretty well Famicom sushi gave it a 30 out of 40 so I mean even so that's not high enough not high enough no it isn't this game's great but basically this is considered to be like one of the best games that never came out in the u.s. it's really unfortunate that this whole series was not represented I mean I don't think these games have a direct relation to each other between terror enigma and brain Lord and illusion a guy and all that but they're still considered a creation trilogy yeah yeah that's a good way of putting it a creation trilogy like like a Kevin Smith trilogy with clerks and more like like the ice cream and blood ones what is the ice cream and bloods cream that they call it for like hot fuzz Oh and Shaun of the Dead oh okay so the movies with that guy well no because they have the same brand of ice cream in every yeah in all three of those movies yeah okay okay I got you I got ya well they had they have big Kahuna burger and all of Tarantino's movies but it well in Tarantino's already said his movies exist in the same universe yeah but anyway sorry I didn't mean to cut you off but it's it's really tragic that these games don't exist on like or they're not represented on the SNES classic at all you know like at least I would have killed to have I'd rather distant Star Fox to me too me too well we'll just have to wait for S or now that it's been hacked we'll just wait for SNES classic to electric boogaloo because you know it's only a matter of time well now that it's already been hacked you know the other loading people are loading their own games oh sure on them now that's it's official of course but I'm waiting for that to be rock-solid before I touch mine well I'm not gonna mod mine because I have a never drive although I want the one that will let you do the super FX games I think that'd be great but but yeah this game totally worth it if you haven't played it in fact I'm kind of thinking I might restart it just because it's been on my mind lately I've been trying to find a PAL copy of it for a while haven't had any luck so we'll see all right there it is your classic game of the week tear enigma on the Super Nintendo sadly never in the US but I'm sure lots of you have played it anyway bastards wink before we go to our break Bobby black wolf with a technical question for the goddess of the classic game of the week by black wolf wants to know is Starcraft 2 eligible for classic game of the week because of its copyright date or does the 10-year timer start when the Super Nintendo classic was released my guess would be she did a game that never came out before as classic game of the week once because you know the lore and everything behind that so I would think under those rules it would be eligible but you're not gonna pick a bad game just kidding I'm kidding maybe you can do Stark we can we can we can revisit the thought of Starcraft 2 you mean Star Fox 2 Star Fox 2 we can we can revisit it because I think I would go by its original inception like when it was actually finished why does this Starcraft by the way Star Fox 2 it could it could end up there but people could have been playing it for longer than 10 years but you're probably not gonna pick it we'll see never say never s2 and her Matt says Star Fox 2 would happen sooner than a low to probably that is well none of the halo games are gonna be in there so you may as well just forget it unless it's like a halo parody or knockoff like the Atari halo yeah Atari halo maybe I'd do Atari halo you go but I wouldn't do like actual halo you did and to be and people forget you did marathon at one point so close enough did I yeah you did I'm almost positive you did on the Mac like years ago you know that the bungees first game oh yo that sorry yeah I was like when did I marathon halo no no the game the game yeah I did marathon because it was notable for spawning the garbage that is halo all right sorry it's not garbage garbage actually serves a purpose Bobby Black Wolf says you have two more years halo 2600 was released in 2009 we'll hold out hope that this show you know will be around that long no it should there's no reason why it shouldn't but you know no all right we are gonna take a break though I know we're we've been around a long time tonight and we're gonna take a break but when we come back there's plenty more Orange Lounge radio to come including rapid-fire news a trip around the world with what's in stores this week our mailbag segment and your calls at Orange Lounge radio on Skype when we come back after this break with more of Orange Lounge radio welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge radio live tonight episode number 704 of our show in progress for this October the 15th of 2017 if you're just joining us you missed some chat earlier in the show about loot boxes and talking about that big big acquisition of humble bundle by IGN and Gen 3 Pokemon coming to Pokemon go soon so you just have to check it out at our podcast feed which is available pretty much anywhere podcasts are distributed with one notable exception but I will get into that now but certainly iTunes and Google Play podcasts and all that good stuff if it's not where you listen to podcasts simply check another resource there you go and don't forget we always appreciate nice reviews on all those podcast websites as well but you can always join us live here on Sunday night as well especially on a nice night like tonight where I feel like we're not competing against anything on TV for a change it's all the big TV shit is Sunday nights but I think we have a reprieve this week right Game of Thrones is done is walking dead back I have that is that a thing I have no idea either so I don't think we have anything we're competing against right now at least not until what two weeks from now when I'm sure everybody's gonna be binging Stranger Things but that comes out on Friday so that's so people should be done it's only like eight episodes right change it okay eight episodes isn't a lot so you can you can binge that well no actually no it's more Nate episodes it was quite a few last time it's like 12 or 13 no stranger things is only like six episodes the first time it's more this time I think yeah so I don't know maybe maybe somebody in our chat knows over at live dot vog network comm where Rama says walking dead is next week oh there you go and let's see come on no Gus says Major League Baseball is happening right now well we always have to do compete against sports that's that's always if it's not baseball it's football or it's basketball there's always something on hockey it you know something's always gonna be on on Sunday night okay Kaijuto says it was eight the first the first season was eight okay maybe it is ten this time then you're right it is more this time okay let's move on though less TV more games rapid-fire news starting with Loki this is kind of a weird place to play games but apparently there is a Russian made van and truck company it called I guess gazelle and their gazelle next vans and trucks have a Easter egg hidden in them in fact apparently in this vans dash you can play Tetris but how you unlock it it's quite complicated so they have actually some basic instructions so first you would turn the ignition on start the car activate the right turn signal for three blinks then you would do two clicks of the trip odometer reset twice and says and then push the clutch five times and then rev the engine to 2,000 rpm while turning on the left turn indicator this sounds a lot like that Rainbow Road Tesla thing that Bobby did a video for at the fog network YouTube plug plug but I mean seriously there was that YouTube that he did which showed that except that wasn't really a game he actually showed that to me when I was in Atlanta and he was taking me there yeah you can actually play it well you can turn the dial or whatever to move the pieces back and forth and I think you click on the other dial to drop them so it's it's neat that you can do that why you don't do that I don't know you must be incredibly bored you must really want to play Tetris Tetris on it's like just like there's people that really want to play NES golf on the switch these hacks and things happening yeah so apparently I mean it's a thing but it's just okay that's kind of a head scratcher kind of like Sony making a movie based on the settlers of Catan I can't imagine how that would be there really is no story in the settlers of Catan except for trading and screwing people over by you know building the longest road and you know what they made a movie off of clue it was one of the best things ever so why not then of course they made a movie out of battleship and it was terrible they also made a movie out of you know I feel like I've asked this before media and that was pretty terribly nice him in the movie right it was did he get a chance to say you suck my battleship I don't cuz like oh if nobody in that movie screams you sunk my battleship then that movie ain't worth shit now to be fair apparently this is being okay so this is being driven though they've got basically a few people on board so Dan Lin Gale Katz and Jonathan Eric will produce the film and I guess blaze Hemingway will write the screenplay now some of those names may not sound familiar cats I guess they said he's done 20 or films over the last 20 years including the line of fire in Air Force One I guess Lin has had several movies as well including the new it that you've produced a Sherlock Holmes the Lego movie the invention of lying also Terminator salvation gangsters go on death note so I don't know I didn't mean it's even here miss with some of these Sony movies but I honestly don't know where they would go with this because the it's if there's no plot to the game there's no backstory it's just kind of this game so I don't know what the hell they would do with this other than okay it's a medieval movie about settling its people people settling in the role of Catan at least the Oregon Trail had a story behind it yeah like that would be alright but you could just do a movie based on the actual Oregon Trail you have to remember that game was based on actual events it's a little different settlers of Catan isn't based on anything so alright anyhow hey maybe a movie worry or excuse me movie a movie that actually has a series that could get a movie someday civilization all right I feel big cities why I don't know if I would be comfortable with seeing Gandhi as this evil overlord I'm down that's true anyway civilization 6 which was a game I was playing not that long ago actually they're getting some tweaks coming up the latest update for the game has been announced by Firaxis and it's going to be kind of really tinkering the religion aspect of the game is going to be getting the biggest overhaul religion is a victory condition in the game right now but apparently it's one of the ones that's a little bit broken it doesn't work quite as well so so new beliefs and religious units will be coming out with the game there's also going to be two new pantheons in that new founder follower enhancer and worship beliefs some new buildings and a new combat unit called the warrior monk which sounds like it might tie into religions it sounds like they're really kind of inflating that part of the game this is not DLC it's actually a patch that's going to be happening which is pretty cool I would have thought maybe this would be the year well I guess they just sieve six was last year's game so maybe next year we're gonna see something kind of what did they call it beyond Earth those is the Alpha Centauri but I think they did beyond Earth on Civ fives engine so to be interesting to see if we get the Civ 6 in space or maybe maybe something else Civ 4 got the colonization reimagining so maybe they'll do something else with Civ 6's engine but that would probably be around next year but this year you get some balancing issues and that'll be good also in news with this the news this week I was going to bring up this story from our pals of Bahmani style calm but their website appears to be down right now I guess too many people are all story oh so hopefully somebody is also seen this but I know the article was about harmonics collecting the best rock band stories out there for a 10-year celebration of rock band all in related news rock band is 10 years old that's a game of the week yeah I know right that makes me feel really old but that is that's where we're at rock band is that old and so they're collecting some good stories and memories there probably to do some sort of retrospective that they're working on there so I'm sure we have a few I know that I always thought that um loud event that you know seg was on the show promoting a couple times was pretty cool and I did I got to do the hosting thing for one year that was a lot of fun so hopefully that would be something that will make it into the memories book so all right dark Sakura what do you have for rapid-fire news oh just some stuff in fact the thing that I actually would rather like to have only for one game the this thing called the super retrocade is going to be launching this year and it has a lot of Capcom and Data East stuff on it the game I am most interested in is being able to play three wonders at home on my TV that would be great but it comes has wired controllers you can do save states SD card support HDMI AV out and 90 titles so that'll be cool if the emulation is good yeah 90s good well apparently their last console emulation one so good so they got to work on that and then something else too and I've actually seen some of this being played is a Jersey Jack is releasing a new Pirates of the Caribbean pinball that blows the other one out of the water haha pirate joke are I get it but it has like this like whirlpool and you can shoot cannons back and forth between two ships in this little triple spinner in the middle that really makes for some unpredictable ball control it's it's really nice it is really good and if you don't know Jersey Jack did the tables that they did did was the Hobbit and Wizard of Oz and the third one I can't remember what it was but they did it so this is their fourth table I know very cool all right yeah they're like a they're like a newer pinball company right they have some stuff at the coin op here locally I feel like one or two of those tables has shown up there so I could be wrong I don't know all right let's travel around the world and check out some games that are coming out in a store near you this week what's on shelves this week Loki lots of things so we've got starting off a a tree in Odyssey 5 beyond the myth that's gonna be out on 3ds Gran Turismo sport on PlayStation VR Oh Rogue Trooper Redux on PC PlayStation 4 and Xbox one South Park the fractured butthole on PC PlayStation 4 and Xbox 1 I think there will be a lot of people jumping into that one WWE 2k 18 on PC the switch PlayStation 4 and Xbox one city shrouded in shadow on PlayStation 4 spelunker party on PC in the switch did you say shitty shrouded in shadow no city shrouded in shadow shitty walk is what sounds like you said they're shitty walk shitty shrouded and say that three times fast she sells seashells by the seashore at the shitty see forget it life is strange before the storm episode 2 on PC PlayStation 4 and Xbox one fire emblem warriors on the Nintendo switch in 3ds Siberia on the switch and I believe that is it they also had a megaton rainfall which is a game I was looking forward to however I don't see that on the PlayStation Store so I don't think that's coming out all right let's travel to Japan it's not quite a busy week in Japan as it is here but they are still some releases worth looking forward to on the October the 19th Kyo A Toshi comes out in Japan Gran Turismo support Gran Turismo support Gran Turismo sport gets its regular and released in Japan this week on the 19th Street Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy 30th anniversary it's a daki comes out this week I'm not sure what that is is that a board game oh it's oh it's the board game thing okay that looks cute I wonder did they bring that over here probably not probably they brought it the daki Street on the Wii those fortune Street yes right okay okay so it's that but in Japan with Dragon Quest Final Fantasy characters Psycho Break 2 in Japan this week and Lego ninja go movie the game and I go Ninjago I would say ninja go cuz I can't help but think of the ninja wrap I saw that movie last night ninja go is all right oh the Ninjago movie yeah huh it was all right wasn't cuz the others I it's not as funny as the other ones but it had its funny moments and if you want to show your undying love for Gran Turismo sport you can actually pick up the PlayStation 4 Gran Turismo sport it actually looks pretty sick I like it it's a gray and I really like the way the controller looks in that so you can get that in Japan if you really want this week but I don't know if you're gonna pay that much money for it on the Vita this week that same fortune Street with Dragon Quest Final Fantasy that will be

where we would jump into the mailbag and read the emails that you send us participate at orange launch radio.com but I'm not sure we have anything let's not remember see yeah there were someone there oh were there well yeah from the eighth oh I guess okay yeah I guess the eighth was seven days ago we didn't read them on the last show no all right well the eighth happened after the last show no that was the last show that was Sunday okay well then shit I don't think I read them but whatever let me look I'm gonna look over your shoulder real quick because it says yeah I don't remember reading this we probably didn't because it weren't you not here oh okay then move them into the trash can when you have done read them sorry I'll stop piling dishes in the same and that's a good habit leaving the seat up those are all good habits to have all right so there were no emails this week shame on all of you you can send us an email if you like participate at orange lounge radio.com do a kitten poker did last week and send an email it says hi I just don't want your mailbox to be empty although we appreciate questions or insight especially perspective if you have a reaction to a story that we talk about here on the show an email to go along with that always helps participate at orange lounge radio.com not hiccups at orange lounge radio.com but participate at orange lounge radio.com we do have some more news stories to get into though and then we'll open up our skype line at orange lounge radio on skype all one word let's get to those stories first though starting with Loki yes this week they have the oculus connect event so they made several announcements regarding the oculus platform so along with that of course is that the price drop that they did back in the summer for the oculus rift is now gonna be permanent so that'll be $3.99 now for the headset and two sensors and the touch controllers and I guess a bunch of games so you can check that out also they announce that their standalone headset that's gonna be its own platform that doesn't require any sort of phone or anything is gonna be coming out pretty soon that is the oculus go it's gonna be coming up for $199 and apparently you know it is gonna be its own standalone thing it's gonna have a single palm controller kind of similar to what they have with the oc the gear VR so it's gonna be a little bit different in that sense then they also announced there was yet another platform that they were working on but that's not they're sending out dev kits for that right now so that's something that's in the future but it's gonna be kind of think similar long lines of the oculus go but more souped up it probably more expensive along with that they were showing off some new games that are gonna be coming out for the rift one of which is being worked on by respawn entertainment so they've you know got a game coming as well I'm not sure exactly what it's gonna be but they've made some pretty cool games Bobby's in our chat room over at live dot vog network comm saying that oculus go is the gear VR but without the phone requirements that's pretty much the level of awesome you can expect out of that yeah I mean it's something it's something you know if you're if you're an Apple person you know you know you don't really have access to gear VR so this is some way you could do that so I mean Alan has the gear VR cuz he got his when he got his galaxy yeah I I have one but mines for these six so it's pretty old and they've used it the first day and we haven't used it since just saying I've used it a couple times I use the gear the oculus F kid to more than I have the gear VR and honestly I don't like using it with my phone too much because my phone screens kind of it's not as high resolution as it could possibly be and I don't know it's just the stuff that you can get on the phone games it's not all that great they've got minecraft which is kind of cool but I would be more interested in something now that I have a more powerful PC that can actually do VR more interested in playing that in fact actually having bothered to hook up my DK to to my PC but I'm kind of curious to see what that would be like now they can run the frame rates for some of those games mm-hmm but I do want to get an actual oculus headset at some point or vibe five is more expensive though but hopefully with them dropping the price permanently that'll drive them to drop their price yeah there's a little VR refresh happening going on right now cuz PlayStation VR just had their Japan just got right and then also there's still all those other VR devices that are gonna be coming for like Windows for like Windows holographic and stuff like that so you know where are those because those are supposed to be cheaper in price as well so eventually it'll be just like buying a monitor mm-hmm yeah me interesting all right well moving on maybe maybe a game that you can play in VR if they're making it for it I don't know is riot games next game because it is funny that they're called riot games when they only really have one game which of course is League of Legends if you weren't already aware now League of Legends has been a game that's been around since what 11 years been a while at least riot games been around since 2006 I don't think League of Legends came out right away but it's been out a little while but anyway the two founders of riot games did say this week they are handing off the management of League of Legends to other folks so they can make a new game it will be the second big video game released for riot games in their time that they have been operating so that's pretty awesome so they are gonna be handing over those operations to the chief financial officer so as the chief technical officer and the president of the company we don't know what that game is gonna look like we may see some type of phone game who knows or maybe they would get into making who knows an MMO they could do anything so we'll see what riot games decides to develop and to be fair I guess they actually have done tabletop tabletop and small games so the s in riot games is justified but as far as like you know games on video of sorts go this is really the only one they've got so they'll have another one oh maybe in like seven years when they finally finish it right because video games take a little while to work on I don't know if you guys know video games take a while to finish right low-key loot boxes are hard to develop yes right they have to find that I've already had to work in all my monetization stuff you know that's that's why I'm planning first because as I've been shown by the triple-a industry that is the most important does League of Legends have loot boxes I don't think it does they have it's like the in-game gold that you earn and then you use that in-game gold to buy the skins and stuff I thought we had buy it skins because obviously it's a free-to-play game you gotta be making their money some earn in game gold slowly or you put the money now it's like Heroes of the Storm used to be before Heroes of the Storm put in loot boxes and now Heroes of the Storm runs on once again though both free games I don't care that's I'm fine with that if it's a free game right it's just that double dipping feeling that I don't like right all right but we won't rehash the conversation from earlier so let's move on to what Dark Sakura has for us I got some stuff you want to see what I have sure it has to do with Minecraft um never mind just kidding Minecraft still cool well you know how people have built these like amazing recreations of like Helms Deep and all of this business well there is a like a sculpture event that happens in Minecraft there's one that's called the perfect marionette that won first place in the contest and I mean it is massive and it's a full-on sculpture I mean if you look at it closer yeah you can see it's made up of little bricks but I mean just from a distance it looks like a full-on like sculpture sculpture and there are like just some crazy ones like one looks like a an explosion in mid explode and just all these other things it's absolutely amazing and the fact that you know this game has quite literally turned into an art form I was gonna say like some people paint with watercolor some people paint with oils some people are using Minecraft it's crazy but like awesome but it still requires I think some of the same skills that one would have in doing any type of sculpture or other kind of rendering absolutely to do a proper sculpture you have to have your sense of movement you have to have your son well I'd say dynamic movement you also have to have your color balance you have to have scale I mean it's really some amazing work these people have done I knew a gal years ago and I mean years ago like back when I first did Rocky Horror at the bird cage that's how long ago was right I knew this gal and one hobby that she used to enjoy she made paintings but she did them in MS paint I kid you not she did them pixel by pixel she would zoom in all this is she could do her little art pixel by pixel and I I can't help but think you know I've lost touch with her over the years I have no idea where she is today but if she's discovered minecraft like that would be perfect for her because isn't that what minecraft is basically this it's sculpting pixel by pixel right sort of it really is and yeah I've seen I've seen some amazing work done in MS paint so it's really the equivalent oh yeah remember when they tried to get rid of it people lost their shit because they were going to 3d paint or whatever yeah yeah so they're MS paint that's right but there's there's some website now what was that site you could you could go on there and it's just like MS paint you make your drawing but like it saves it on the web and you can like share your drawings other people dang there's some art site and used to be like a game people would do I remember though it was it was a networked art program and I can't remember what it was called but I used to use it all the time where we just get like it was actually I was I was using it with Tiara and our friend Kim and we would and a few other people but we would all get into like have a live server and play in this graphics program dark Tetsuya says oh a cocky no I think I remember oh a cocky though I think that was yeah I'm that's close to what I'm thinking of but that's not it I remember oh a cocky that was like that's more like a type though that was that's like a 1998 thing yeah well really um but now I can't remember what it was called but it was really fun I mean and now especially I'd say that's even one of our earlier precursors to the you know now collaborative applications we have but still I mean I love watching people turn the most unexpected thing into real art you know so it's pretty cool yeah all right well you go artists in Minecraft meanwhile Loki all right so kind of keeping on track with VR of course not to be out valve had some announcements regarding additional components to developing VR systems for device manufacturers basically the new technology is available with the free license that's available for valves room scale VR tracking technology and they say it includes an optical system manufacturing calibration tools and software that aims to make a better user experience and says the new features now they're meant to allow I guess better you know steam VR compatible head-mounted displays also increased sharpness head tracking and that sort of thing so that's cool once again you know it's like we saw with these other companies developing their own VR devices that are kind of giving you compatible with one platform I think Val's taking a smart approach with it too because you know unlike oculus it's kind of like okay we've got our own storefront that's separate from everything valve is like okay hey let's make as many devices as we can that support steam because everybody uses team so why not I'm all for that especially that means I'm gonna get a cheaper headset later on that's still pretty good the price of this technology is coming down and I think that's how more and more people are gonna end up adopting it sooner or later yeah sooner or later and then more and more applications are becoming available better applications because right now we're still kind of in that whole Nintendo DS touchscreen thing where no one knows how to utilize the tech they're just kind of like doing these gimmicky games it's gonna be more smartly used I guess so check that out well and finally in the news tonight something that you've been waiting all show for because Jason referenced it in tonight's introduction a big thanks to Jason by the way he always does those intros to our show we appreciate it I'm gonna miss them next week as he'll be at twitch con so you're stuck with me and looks like unless I can get a guest announcer maybe we'll try to get a guest announcer next week but anyway this is a new playable character for WWE 2k 18 I don't know if you guys play those games at all but if you do you can look forward to a brand new playable character in WWE and you might be wondering well which wrestler is this based off of is it is it going to be my twin Sami Zayn well he might be in the game too but this particular character I want to talk about is Colonel Sanders that's right Colonel Sanders KFC his character now there is catch you have to assemble him in create a wrestler but you can actually do it because I guess the guests are sponsored achievements and trophies in this too boy you think loot boxes are bad here's a glimpse at the future on our last they already do that they like in Madden they ever they had advertisements in Madden for like other things not talking about like integrated into the arenas like you know you'd see well they actually integrate into the loading screens like for cell phone service and stuff like that so that's been a thing and sponsored stuff I mean it's silly but this kind of stuff I like it's just dumb I mean who doesn't want to see Colonel Sanders beating down people the question is why is it more you know we need more of this like I know I want Colonel Sanders to be beating up the scary King thing from Burger King that I don't even thinks been the mascot for years we still need our and Wendy because all those companies yeah have you seen Burger King and Wendy on Twitter recently they are savage to each other they are not nice like this 2017 you guys when you when you can't wait to be dragged by a corporate brand on Twitter and then we have Arby's being cool with their marketing yeah Arby's Arby's does Arby's the only thing Arby's has going for it is they have a 50 50 50 shake that's like an orange cream shake that's fucking awesome everything else at Arby's fucking terrible I would disagree with that I split a sandwich with Dan and there was so much meat in it that it was two sandwiches worth it was pretty good deal yeah but it's like now if I can get whoever does those ads to make like little you know sculptures for me I would my favorite was a little peach on one they did for Rama it was so cute mm-hmm like a meat sculpture I mean their ads are they take like the the their sandwich boxes and make like anime figures and video game figures and scenes from like the other day they did like an emu yasha one they're so cute oh see that must have been what happened was they converted their box into a sandwich and that's what I ate because it's certainly what it tasted like all right well that is our last story that we have up for the night so that means it's time for the Skype line and you can give us a call over at orange lounge radio all one word on Skype if you'd like to give us a call and talk about anything we've discussed so far tonight or maybe there's something you want to talk about again that's orange lounge radio all one word on Skype and it's lighting up right now so let's get to it and then a little later I'll be checking in to see if there's any last-minute stories as well but I think it's connecting and we have a call on the line hello you're oh it's not connected nope hi you're on orange lounge radio who's this trust me Rob we're fully connected here oh well when you put it that way what's on your mind tonight buddy oh I didn't know the cam was gone I put some clothes on I'm sorry yeah no we know me oh we're echoing by the way so be careful about that yeah we know we still have the cam we're gonna be on this rig for a little while sadly until we can test some new things Loki is gonna be bringing the laptop into this so we can test a conversion over and yeah I'm just paranoid about some new things but Loki has a computer we can play with so that's exciting well I will email you about that because that's how we do our Skype line for our show fabulous I'd like to know more about it well what's on your mind tonight well I just want to say that the Twitter accounts for Arby's Wendy's and Burger King gives me life it gets me through my day and Denny's which God what what shit food no but it's more Wendy's because of lewd Wendy and everybody I know cosplaying her it was yeah do people actually cosplay the Wendy's character and Ronald McDonald of course they do why asking this question there's a reddit for people posting their boobies next to Pokemon of course people can of course you know like with Saints Row freckle bitches that's really a thing that's really a thing because for a while somebody in one Asian countries I forget where actually did a gingka forms of all of the fast-food mascots and there were short run doujins and people were cosplaying them unless you probably missed it when I was posting them on Facebook but when I posted Colonel Sanders a third of women were like daddy oh my god no I I did miss that there's the way he was drawn all the women were like hi I guess I haven't they kind of like redone Colonel Sanders anyway he's not they de-aged him a few years maybe not just a skosh but um it's a skosh what what's good here um I feel you on the YouTube strikes because every time we go to a con and we upload interviews and masquerades I get strikes from Sony Warner all of them because of the music and I'm like these are not monetary videos keep up here for free leave me alone and yeah you're only using if you use a little clip you're not really supposed to be able to I mean that's still like fair use or whatever so it's just okay you're taking problem yeah the problem is the fact when people do their skits they're using commercial music and it's like you can't tell no and I see nothing wrong with I'm not charging it's like people just want to see what they miss because they couldn't go that weekend right yeah I guess but what happens ultimately they put the claim on your video but they don't really get to do anything right they run ads and then they get the revenue okay so they're running ads and they get the revenue and also one or two things happen either they will be like okay you ain't got to worry about it it's fine or you get an email saying your video has been muted in this country this video is our bit this country and then you get work this video has been pulled so I have I had it bookmarked somewhere this little text of paraphrase text of fear use they copy paste in and I send it to that to YouTube and usually within about three days they like okay fine video is good to go it's the whole the whole kid dancing to Prince thing right didn't that go all the way to the Supreme Court and the they they sided with the the person it was like the little kid in the video dancing to a prince song right what do we miss that so I don't know hmm I'm trying to remember yeah yeah they ruled in the favor of the family not the music company or you can just always do what Jim Sterling does which is the whole copyright deadlock so instead of instead of using you know if you know that there's gonna be like a video flag like say you have Nintendo content in there what you do is you throw in random content from other providers that you know are gonna get flagged as well so he'll throw in like Activision stuff and Sony music stuff and the problem is is everybody creates a copyright claim on the the chat on the piece of video and since you know multiple people can't be the owner of that con copyright content nothing happens to it either I get the money or no one gets exactly none of them get the money I even got flagged by Nintendo okay yeah I've had a couple videos back flagged by Nintendo but to be fair it was like my let's remember you know when I first was trying to streamy stuff of Legend of Zelda which you know okay fine they had a they had a case to it I wish there was just a way we could like split revenue instead of but well you can you can you can sign up as one of their partners and you get a tiny pittance of their uh revenue hard pass yeah the thing is my Nintendo video this was when they now this was at the midnight release of the Wii U I'm just like seriously they copyright claimed your Wii U launch video yep that's kind of funny I don't know why oh and uh before I get out of here let me just say real quick when you're talking about Pokemon Go not safe working on all that and we did a all hentai episode and Mako-chan spearheaded that okay so if you're talking about who's the biggest perv around here you talk to her she's the mistress why can't we do an all hentai episode because that they already did it that's wait wait wait rob rob there are there are age games you can do there are age games they're they're also animates but they're age games you can do them you can yeah I can I can get you a list I know step it up we'll do hentai month I mean like hey you know what Jamie's gonna run out of the classic system thing here at the end of the year she's gonna be like I say hentai of the week for the 2018 theme there are many many more systems out there rob that's worth a shot I mean the one most popular anime is out there fate stay night it started as a hentai game fair enough well we we'll consider everything for uh for next year all right all right rama I'm gonna let you go but best of luck with the future of anime jam session and whatever you guys are doing this week and beyond yeah I'm recovering from my four-day whirlwind trip so yeah I'll be talking about that you were over here on this coast right no I was in the midwest this is what happened thursday I fly out to Denver for one of our staffers I've known for years she got married and she walked out to the star wars imperial march which was awesome awesome then I came back relaxed and today like Bob Coffey we went to the um love live second uh concert event happy party train tour this was the week I was supposed to be in New York sadly this was this must be fabulous week for us yeah my friend did get married this weekend but I couldn't I couldn't take the time off and just so you guys know I was able to do Seattle not New York because Seattle 80 dollars I only took one day off of work to do it because I had a long weekend anyway so uh but New York is still something we're looking at hopefully for next year Rob we'll do we'll have fabulous week again real soon seriously sounds good I'm gonna hold you to that better all right take care of my friend thanks for calling too bro take care all right bye all right we're gonna uh open up the skype line again for anyone else who wants to call over at orange lounge radio all one word on skype if you'd like to give us a call to talk about whatever's on your mind tonight regarding video games hopefully but I don't know it's been a short part b compared to part a who knows all right well at least the phones are lighting up tonight so the emails might have disappointed but the phones so far at least are not so the only thing about using this little ipad thing is it takes a little longer to connect and then sometimes the callers hang up anyway so uh that just would happen there so we'll have to wait and see if that person calls back uh loki did you have a last minute story while we try to wait for another call here at orange andreo on skype no not really i mean um bethesda did another twitter like post for wolfenstein um and of course you know it's the whole you know make not make america nazi free again type stuff oh yes well they had one now that's basically kind of a new one on top of that that said there's only one side to this and so if you're a nazi then like fuck off or something to that fact all right well we have another caller on the line so let's get to it hi you're on orange lounge radio who's this hey this is act deaf hey act deaf what's on your mind buddy well finally my sns classic the story came to a good ending yay i heard i i saw this on twitter so you finally got your sns classic right yeah i finally did after two weeks but yeah i finally did so what happened did amazon try to make nice nice or was it just out of the blue suddenly they were like oh we got it now yeah it was totally out of the blue uh on wednesday like wednesday morning uh i got an email for one of my sns classic orders that said i was going to get it next wednesday until the 18th and then i uh and i started searching on twitter if any uh any other person and people uh started getting their emails and yeah it's um uh a lot of people started getting emails and and yeah i i then got another email confirming about my other sns classic order for a friend so it was great but i didn't expect it that amazon the next day sent me a notification about oh you're getting this sns classic tomorrow delivered i'm like whoa really yeah maybe that was their kind of like nice nice thing was that since they took so long instead of doing the two day shipping they went ahead and bumped it up to the overnight shipping maybe that was their little consolation whatever they could do yeah most probably but i'm happy that i got it and probably earlier than i then i expected i would have loved it that they would have fulfilled the order on time at all but it this is better than nothing at least so i don't have to finally have one i bet uh question from our chat over at live.vognetwork.com ssj100 matt says so are you going to keep amazon prime after all this because it seemed like an issue with nintendo more than amazon then again they didn't look good with the treasure truck stuff i'm gonna keep amazon not because of amazon itself because of twitch okay yeah since since i do use the the free subscription thank you for that and and yeah especially because of you uh but still the the promotions i get from twitch like the twitch prime loot boxes and all that stuff it's really great so i i don't want to miss that so instead of like just paying for twitch prime i'll pay for amazon too and keep the all the other stuff too so but i'll probably think twice before or ordering something on amazon at least uh nintendo stuff and and reservations so yeah very interesting and i bet you know to be fair uh amazon probably loves that answer that you know there's more than just the shipping that's the kind of the value in being amazon prime you know at least in you know in their minds you know and again you would have what like the amazon tv because you know we sometimes forget that oh yeah amazon has a tv service as well where you know they've got their shows like transparent does very well and you know some of their other stuff um and then uh you know that what they got a music thing now too and stuff so this is all going to be justification for them to keep upping the price i'm sure um let's see uh bobby blackwolf in chat says i wish twitch allowed the amazon family accounts to use the twitch prime stuff even if it was only one per account i wish i didn't have to tie my fiance's amazon prime account to my twitch to get the prime benefits so well there's maybe uh you actually can because that's what uh my brother and i do that oh so you actually can uh don't know if it's something on on the accounts or something that you have to change oh bobby says not in the us oh well maybe that's that's the thing but uh yeah my brother and i can and it's and it's different account so well rub it in why don't you i'm just kidding all right here's another serious question before we let you go now that you have the super nintendo classic in your hand what do you think it's it's really great i i i'm loving it so far even though i haven't played that much uh because i got it yesterday basically uh but i'm loving it it's really practical because even like last night uh i had a a party with some friends uh a friend of mine uh had a birthday a celebration so since we're all gamers i i pretty much thought well everybody wants to see the esnes classic so i'll take it and we all everybody had a blast everybody wanted to play uh we played street fighter uh kirby's dream course he had lots of fun and me personally i have uh and i haven't played it much uh that much sorry but i'm loving it because of just only because of the games because the 21 games that are there are really great even despite the star fox not being that uh not aging that well but aside from that it's a really great machine and i even love it more than than the next classic despite the next classic like having three games and having all those games also really great but don't know that the next classic seems like a better value even well in the next year we get to do this all over again for the game boy classic so just hold on yeah and i was actually gonna ask something about uh and the relevance of that yeah sure because uh well the the anniversary for uh the third anniversary is gonna be until uh 2019 but i was thinking about uh if if nintendo goes uh and makes a gameboy mini would would just would you have rather have uh like an app on your phone or would you rather see something like the switch that you can have a portable gameboy mini gameboy classic and also hook it up to your tv oh good question i would like to see a simple hdmi out cable i think could fix a lot of that um but then maybe you'd have to be able to plug in a controller that could get a little dicey um um with like a port they have like portable nes emulators i think yeah so i mean yeah something's anything's possible with that but um i would like to more see a link cable i think that would be hilarious if you can actually connect two game boys together with a link cable no i think that's something they might do especially so people can relive the pokemon stuff but if they are going to do a gameboy classic and they put pokemon on it they're gonna have to figure out a way to get these things in the pokemon bank so your idea about it being able to talk to the switch somehow maybe through infrared maybe not too far off so maybe not necessarily like link it to the switch but like having the switch port the tv doc have it like uh uh like an output for tv so you can play like oh you can play gameboy uh games like in the super game boy back in the day that'd be awesome but then again with this being nintendo i'm not gonna hold my breath either or how about we just release the fucking virtual console how about that we just released the virtual console for the switch don't talk crazy now come on i know it's just so weird that you know i would expect them to put something that's been on the last few systems on their current system they want us to all forget that we bought an nes classic so that way when they release balloon fight yet again we're ready to buy it again that's that's what we're waiting on here so yeah early next year probably all right act after i'm gonna let you go to try to see if anyone else wants to get through but thank you and i'm i'm very happy that this amazon story had a happy ending and thank you i think it's good that we follow up on happy endings as well as negative endings so i appreciate the call hey thanks for having me all right take care my friend have a good night you do all right one eight seven seven game olr if you want to do it the old-fashioned way but orange lounge radio on skype is an even better way because for a limited time it's the only way you get to see video here in the studio or just it's really just me it's the ipad pointed at me because we're using an old ipad i can't believe this is now an old ipad but it is it's it's ipad three or the new ipad or whatever they called it at that time that's what we're running skype off of right now orange lounge radio all one word on skype we'll just give it a few minutes to see if anybody wants to get through but if not then we'll probably go ahead and wrap things up i'll check in one more time with my co-host to see if there's any last minute excuse me last minute stories yeah yeah with the latest trend that we've been seeing uh with people coming to twitter and stuff to report sexual abuse and scandals of course there's a few ties with the gaming industry um there was i think was the gaming grumps or something like that there was a whole issue with that but now we've got someone heard that yeah there was one i don't remember it was some group i think it was the game grumps it may have been i could be wrong i heard only read the story once but it was like the head happens that's the head thing to get wrong so right yeah so don't take my word for it um anyways so there was a guy by the name of david ballard who was an environmental and multi or very mental and multiplayer level artist for uncharted two through four and last of us apparently he uh with the twitter talking about some sexual harassment that he received at from his workplace so he said in late 2015 i was sexually harassed the naughty dog by a lead my work environment became extremely toxic afterward in february 2016 i had a mental breakdown at work and suddenly playstation hr became involved well i told him about the harassment the end of the call and fired me the next day they decided the company was moving in a different direction and my job was no longer needed they tried to silence me by offering me twenty thousand dollars if i signed a letter agreeing to the termination as well as not to disclose it with anyone else i declined to sign i've been unemployed for 17 months since this is when the interviewers um asked why i left naughty dog i said i was burned out by the crunch ashamed to get to the root of the problem of being sexually harassed i'm speaking out now because of the strength of i've seen others come forward about their experiences in tv film industry it's the hardest thing i've ever had i've ever done in laywin uh kill my drive or love for video game industry and my passion for life and then of course they naughty dog released the statement as well as we've been recently uh we have recently read on social media the next employee of naughty dog dave allard claims he was sexually harassed when he worked at naughty dog we have not found any evidence of having received allegations from mr ballard as he was harassed in any way of naughty dog or sony or active entertainment harassment inappropriate conduct have no place at naughty dog or sony interactive entertainment we have taken and always will report sexual harassment and other workplace grievances very seriously and blah blah blah so so i don't i don't know where to go without getting too soapboxy with this whole thing but it's very obvious that i think there's been a lot of dark shit that's happened out there and finally people are putting their fucking foot down and saying we're not going to fucking take this anymore and even the once thought impenetrable hollywood dark stories of casting couches and things like that you know finally people are saying we are sick of this shit period and it's just a sad reminder that everything you're seeing happening in hollywood right now it's not unique to hollywood it happens pretty much in every industry and it needs to stop and some shithole guy who was like a lawyer in the industry was going out saying well now we're gonna hear nothing but this in the future like it's a bad thing that it's coming out to light how long is have a lot of people probably repress this exactly well right now on facebook there actually is the people posting me too it's happening on twitter it's happening everywhere yeah people need to fucking see it it happens a lot more than you think it is and it needs to stop and people that you'll never be a part of it and never judge anybody by what they wear no one is ever fucking asking for it it's just disgusting i'm nothing is consent except consent exactly and lack of an answer is not consent so anyway all right a good uh a good uh lesson to end the show on tonight but uh you know we i know we say uh game industry needs to do better here's an example and i realize it's a dicey situation there's you know his story a naughty dog story and so forth but you know what um it's probably this is probably one unfortunately unfortunately of many stories that are out there and um people need to do better and be better people and not prey on um other people yeah i was unable to find out which site that was there was a pretty major site i just don't remember i may be remembering who it was yeah correctly i saw it like i can't i can't find it so we'll presume everyone to be innocent for now all right well since our skype line is not lighting up with any more calls i'm going to assume that is it for the calls tonight and i think it's about time we go ahead and we wrap things up here at orange launch radio for the night but i do once again want to thank you guys for participating with our program whether it was live or it was on the podcast feed either way you are awesome for stopping by orange launch radio and the motivation why we do this show every week uh if you liked what you heard here at orange on radio please tell a friend or two about the show because it is the show where every gamer has a voice but you know we need uh we need to spread the word to have those voices here of course a nice five star review on a site like itunes or wherever it is you found this podcast those go a really long way like i can't emphasize how much good those things do for you to take 15 seconds and do something like that uh it's a great great great gift so thank you um that's gonna do it i think we're ready to wrap things up with final thoughts tonight um i'm going to start tonight because mine's a little bit of a downer so i apologize for it but i have to get it off my chest um our cat sanrio is is not doing well um she's breathing kind of funky and we're a little worried uh it could be something that's hopefully easily cleared up but it may be something that's um not um she's 17 years old so we're kind of mentally prepared that you know this this may be something really bad um but that's something we do we are we do have a vet thing set up for tomorrow so i just appreciate all the uh all the kind thoughts and anything whatever it is that you believe in out there that you can put in the universe that'll help help our kitty i'd uh really appreciate that so um sorry for the downer but it's been on my my mind all night so uh dark sakura your final thought tonight hopefully something a little better sorry um well i'm not exactly the biggest bundle of positivity sorry um but uh we're we're going to have a donut donuts donuts all right that's a great note and have a donut have a donut i found it sorry um it was not gaming grumps so not the tarnished surname screen junkies a guy named andy sigmar uh signor was the accused of it apparently um there's a woman by the name that came out and talked about it um saying that you know uh and apparently a lot more people i think came out about it as well showing the new texts about how they were um he was sexually harassing several people over dms on twitter and all sorts of things so that was the case and so they're looking at screen junkies and defy media they're looking into it but he's been um i think suspended while they conduct their investigation so that's what's been going on well thank you for your commitment to righting any wrongs that you may put out there here on the show garbage humans belong in the garbage uh you do have an opportunity here though to make an actual last thought here if you'd like loki maybe something positive like donuts donuts i don't know i don't want donuts um i don't know just hopefully i'll play some actual games this week playing games that's a positive thing and donuts that's the reason playing games while eating donuts yes that's pretty much how you can sum up us here at orange lounge radio so uh enjoy your video games and enjoy your donuts we'll see you in seven days good night you've been listening to
