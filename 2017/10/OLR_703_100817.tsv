46800	50000	really horrible stuff out there in the world, so I hope we can take your mind off it for
50000	54420	a couple hours tonight while we talk about some video games here in our studio, and seven
54420	58740	and located in Sacramento, California with me, Rob Roberts. You might know me on Twitter
58740	64340	at Skie, S-K-I-E, and joining me as she usually does right over there, DarkSakura or Jamie
64340	69480	Summers. Oh hi. Hi, how are you Jamie? I'm okay. Yeah? I like your hair, you have this
69480	72980	like, and I know it's a radio show so I have to describe it, but she's got like this purple
72980	77660	on top kind of fading down into black, it's like the fade. It's purple to purple. Jamie's
77660	80920	in the fade. It's like fuchsia to purple. It looks black but it's also kind of dark
80920	83840	in the studio because it's trying to keep the heat down a little bit. Okay, I can kind
83840	87760	of see it. Yeah, in purple. Eh, radio, you'll just have to, you know. Take our word for
87760	92200	it. Exactly. Use your imagination. That's right, use your imagination, it'll take you
92200	96000	very far. Well we'll check in with Jamie and her gaming week in just a minute, but I want
96000	100680	to talk to Techmaster Loki as well. Hello. Hi, how are you, Loki? I'm good. Hey, everybody's
100680	104880	here this week. Yay. It's not yay. What a nice reunion we're having tonight. And we're
104880	109360	relatively plague free. That's right, relatively. Hopefully everybody stays disease free for
109360	117000	a while here. How are you doing, Loki? I'm doing fine. Yeah, I'm full. Full of what?
117000	122200	Hamburger. Hamburger. Hamburger. Yeah, because they went, they opened up a way back burgers,
122200	126880	I guess. Never heard of that. It's, I guess it's a nationwide chain, but it's a burger
126880	132240	place. They make like fresh burgers and that type of stuff and it's really good. Do Sherman
132240	137280	and Peabody deliver it from ancient Greece? How come we don't have restaurant sponsors
137280	141240	on this show? All these people you give a shout out to don't give us money. So now you
141240	144520	need to see some, say something bad about your experience. These pitas are brought to
144520	148360	you by Sarah. Well, the fries were just kind of okay. They're all right. They weren't like
148360	152600	fantastic. Thank you. Thank you. All right. We also have a special guest in studio. I
152600	157200	do want to of course always acknowledge the ever present guests that's on our show at
157200	160700	the chat room because we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice geeks network of
160700	165920	vog network.com six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby black will show

170100	175240	at live.vognetwork.com. We're going to get into some gaming chat here in just a minute,
175240	178640	but we do have a special guest here in studio. Actually, Jamie, do you want to introduce
178640	184320	somebody? Somebody that the audience has been asking to have back. So Jamie, some kid we
184320	192380	picked up in the back alley from a free candy truck. Stop picked up from a candy truck.
193380	198420	So welcome back to the show everybody. Julian is back this week. How you doing? Good. Good.
198420	202800	Now for some folks listening to the show who might not know you, how old are you? I'm 10
202800	206680	years old. You're 10 years old. When's your birthday? Um, April 27th. Okay. So you're
206680	212300	like 10 and a half almost. Almost. All right. Getting close, getting close. Uh, so, so you
212300	217600	did not come from a candy van, but what kind of car do you want to drive someday? I have
217600	225360	no idea. How am I supposed to know? I'm 10 years old. I just got told he's going to have
225360	230360	a testerosa cause he's going to be super rich and famous one day for his wit and humor.
230360	235980	I just, I just wanted mom to be thinking about that. That's only six years away to start
235980	240120	thinking about all that stuff. But anyway, all right. All right. It's, it's a video game
240120	246720	show, Julian. Um, hopefully you've never heard it cause it's very disgusting sometimes. We
246720	251160	can say whatever we want to around him. It's a joke. It's a joke. What types of, what types
251160	258560	of video games do you like to play, Julian? Um, I like to play puzzle fantasy sci-fi games.
258560	267920	Um, um, I like to play, um, puzzle games, fantasy games, sci-fi games. I find those
267920	272440	games the most entertaining for me. Okay. When you first said puzzle fantasy sci-fi
272440	276280	was like, wow, did he find a game that's like all three of those things? Cause that would
276320	281400	be really cool. Like a game like that. I don't know. Have you ever played puzzle quest? That's
281400	286440	kind of puzzle and fantasy a little bit. No, I've never heard of that game. That could
286440	290600	be portal. Okay. Yeah. Portal. Well, what kind of, do you have, do you have some titles,
290600	297440	some games that you like to play? Um, I like to play undertale. Okay. Oh, that's a good
297440	305080	one. Spore game about evolution. Yeah. Okay. Oh, yes. Spore. Um, I like pirate one on one.
305080	311840	Okay. Um, I try to think of games that I play. That's okay. I find myself in that position
311840	315720	every week on this show. Like, what did I play this past week? So undertale, undertale
315720	319640	is like hugely popular. I don't know if you know, but like even people that are like four
319640	324400	times your age enjoy playing undertale and they just, do you play it on the PC or do
324400	332080	you play it on PlayStation or PC? And, um, about a month ago it was on Joe's birthday.
332080	337280	It was whose birthday? About a month ago. It was undertale's on second birthday. Oh,
337280	344520	I didn't know that. So undertale was two years old as of, okay. Did you do anything to celebrate?
344520	354160	Um, at daycare we play the game and everyone had to be an undertale character. So it was
354160	358280	undertale. I'm detecting he might've been sand. Wait, is, of course I was saying I'm
358280	366840	going to be, I don't know. Is, is undertale like, cause I don't really know like the reason
366840	372840	why you're here, you're kind of like our ambassador to the next generation of gamers. Uh, so,
372840	381360	so is undertale like really popular with other like boys and girls your age? Um, very big.
381400	389440	I know tons of people at school that, um, play undertale a whole lot. And, um, some of them are
389440	395400	like hashtag pacifist run and then another, and other people are like, kill them all.
395400	401720	Genocide run is so fun. I love shooting sands. Wait, wait, wait, wait. 10 year olds have hashtag
401720	407960	Wars. That's just something I learned. I always, I always thought that was something unique to
407960	413160	RuPaul's drag race is when they would, you know, put in the corner, you know, hashtag, you know,
413160	418440	shantay, you stay or whatever it is going on there. But okay. So, so hashtag pacifist run
418440	425000	versus hashtag genocide run. All right. On the next Splatfest. Do you play Splatoon? I like that
425000	433640	game. Um, I, um, I've heard of people that play Splatoon, but I don't really play Splatoon.
433880	437800	That's okay. That's okay. There's a lot of games to play. Like there's just, you, you could play a
437800	441800	different video game every day and you'd never play them all. That's, that's the, that's the
441800	449400	reality. So, um, one of the reasons I think part one on one is a great and also a funny game is
449400	454840	one of the, um, questions it asks you, but when you build your character, is it, it goes like
454840	463720	this. So, um, you know, you know, where you're an orphan, how'd your parents die? That's,
463720	470760	that sounds kind of morbid, Julian. I don't know. You like that? I, um, chose that. I chose,
472840	478680	that's okay. I chose, um, that, um, I chose that my parents were eaten by a sky squid. Okay. I'm
478680	486360	sure that makes your mother feel great once you hear that. A sky squid. All right. I got to go.
486360	491080	So, so I'm looking at our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com because I don't know if you
491080	494040	know, but this is, this is actually like on the internet and people are listening to it right
494040	498600	now. And so, so there's some feedback going on right now. Let's see. Uh, Bobby Black Wolf is
498600	502920	suggesting he's too old for Splatoon and that that's for babies. That might be the reason why
502920	508120	you haven't played Splatoon. Uh, let's see. Uh, Dungeon Buster says, is he looking forward to
508120	512920	Wolfenstein the new colossus this month? Are there any games you're looking forward to? Maybe
512920	516840	if not that one, is there anything like you got your eye on like, Ooh, I want to play that when
516840	523880	it comes out? Um, the new dragon age that, um, game that's supposed to, um, come out. I'm playing
523880	527880	after that one comes out. I want to start to play the series and then play that one. You are
527880	533320	definitely your mother's child. I, but that's great. What do you like about dragon age? Um,
534280	542280	I think it's a cool game. It's, um, um, fantasy. Like I said that I liked, um,
542280	549160	fancy games. It also has a great, um, story and, um, it's just a fun game that
550040	554440	a lot of people also like too. Yeah. Black Wolf would like to follow up with that. Who is he
554440	561640	going to romance? No one. Good. Because you're 10. You don't need to worry about Selbasy run.
563320	577080	I broke Rob. Rob is now turning bright fuchsia. He matches my hair. Well done Julian. Well done.
580440	585880	Show's over. Going home. Bye. When I'm dead, turn the show over to Julian.
586440	595800	Rob's done. All right. Let's see. I'm looking in chat. Brad from pop culture says, damn it. Loki.
595800	602200	I just spit water at the monitor. Uh, I love it. Uh, a lot of people taken surprise in our
602200	606200	chat to the fact that undertale is kind of the game that people play in the school yard and
606200	610760	the undertale, uh, is, is the thing that people play at school. What are, are there other games
610760	615880	that kids like to, like, are there other like video game, like playground games that kids get
615880	625000	into? Um, sometimes when they're supposed to be playing, um, this was in fourth grade when, um,
625000	631000	kids were supposed to be on Moby max. People would sneak onto prodigy and play, uh, the wizarding
631000	638120	math game of fantasy. Wait, wait, wait. Prodigy prodigy prodigy still exists. Prodigy still exists.
638120	643160	That's what, that was my, that was me when I was like 12 was prodigy. I was, I, I wonder if it's
643160	648600	the same thing or if it's like somebody else has the name now. It's a video game. Yeah. Well,
648600	653080	when I was attainment, when I was younger, it was, it was games and a bunch of other stuff too,
653080	657160	but the games were probably the best special chat rooms. Wink, wink. Exactly. Exactly. That
657160	663080	sort of thing. So of course, you know, I met Dan through AOL back in the sailor moon chat room.
663800	667800	Remember that Becky? Oh, sorry. We had, we had an eye roll.
669000	676040	So, so, um, you, do you prefer to game on PC versus like PlayStation four and Xbox? Like,
676040	681960	are you in the great PC versus console debate? Where do you stand? I, um, definitely like PC
681960	689000	more because it can, it has a much wider variety of games and it has a lot more things you can do
689000	698760	on it. And it's just, I think it's, um, better, just much, much better. We, um,
699720	705080	because it can, um, play games that are eight bit, 16 bit, 32 bit, and even 64 bit.
705880	709880	It can do it all. It can. And then if it can't do it anymore, you just put a new card in it and
709880	715800	now it can do it. That's, that's how those PCs work. Absolutely. Absolutely. Okay. So sometimes
715800	721960	don't listen to them. Little Mac. Sometimes we get really lucky here at OLR and sometimes people
721960	727640	that actually make games, listen to our show. Uh, have you ever tried to make a game Julian?
727640	731960	Actually, I'm really curious about that. Have you ever tried to make a game? Like, do they teach you
731960	738600	any type of like programming in school now? I'm planning that I want to eventually make a game,
739240	746520	but I'm taking, um, coding classes, um, right now so that I can learn to program so I can
746520	750520	eventually make my own video game. Do you know what they call the, do you know what language
750520	753240	they're teaching you? Do you know what it's called? Do you know if they're teaching you,
753240	761320	like unity or language? Uh, I actually know, um, three languages. Okay. One of them is English.
761320	767080	Okay, good. That's a good one to know. Yeah. The second one is the one that my mom taught
767720	773480	and other people taught me. It's, um, called Pic Latin. Oh, okay. And the third one is me and
773480	780040	the one that me and my friends made up. Um, Lee Latin is where you, um, it's pretty much, um,
780040	789000	Pic Latin, but instead of, um, saying Julian Jay, you'd say Julian July. So,
789080	801800	Aloha. I'm trying. Oh, video game language. Well, I was fascinated by the Pic Latin stuff too,
801800	805160	but yeah, sadly you can't build a video game in Pic Latin. At least not yet.
807080	809080	I'll do Wingdings as the font. Just kidding.
811800	816520	And maybe work some Comic Sans. Just kidding. Into it. I'm sorry. I'm going to have to put
816520	821640	him in the freezer. It was nice knowing you, Julian. Get in the freezer. Well,
821640	829160	that's a little cold of you to say. I will lock you in the meat locker.
831640	837000	I would like to apologize for that. That's entirely my fault. Thank you,
837000	842600	mom. Is that where Julia is the mistress of dad jokes. I appreciate that. I appreciate that.
842600	847320	All right. Uh, yeah. Going into chat, uh, MXC says I am dying. Come on,
847320	852600	no Gus says someone hit a gong. Matt says, did he find Drew's joke book? I think so.
853320	857400	We didn't flush it. We had to press it between wax sheets so that it wouldn't dissolve.
857400	862200	All right. As we all know, it's made out of toilet paper. So, so, so as far as like making
862200	865800	the video games, you're not sure like what the name of the tool is that you're using to make
865800	873800	video games or I don't know, um, what, um, um, tool, tool I'm going to use for, for making a
873800	879560	video game. I know what I could call it. Okay. That's what I was going to ask you. As I was
879560	883240	gonna say, we have people that listen to the show that are, you know, we're lucky that we do have
883240	887720	actually game makers listening to this show. I don't know if you know, but orange sounds radio,
887720	894040	someone actually made a game, actually two games based on ideas that we put out there. So I was
894040	899080	going to say Julian, maybe the game makers out there want to know what game do you want to see?
899080	907000	What game do you want to play? Um, I, um, saw this, um, eight bit 16 bit game that a, um,
907560	913080	14 year old, um, game, what it was, um, a past game that one of my favorite YouTubers played.
913720	920200	He's extremely British. Um, and, um, it was called the mark of oxen and that kind of inspired me
920200	926840	to make a game like that, but not eight bit. Uh, so you want it, you want to do a modern version
926840	933160	of that, but maybe, uh, but I wanna, I want it to be kind of based on that, but not really
934360	944200	just make the whole entire game again, but just 64 bit or something. I want to like have,
944200	951240	I want to base my game on that and I want to, um, change the dialogue. I want the same fighting
951240	957400	style as it, but I'm going to change a lot of the things. I just want to base my game on that.
957400	962280	All right. You know, and sometimes, sometimes you can, you can go back and you can reinvent an idea
962280	966840	and make it better. And you know, that, that might make like a really solid game. I think a ton of
966840	971000	people are trying to do that to Minecraft, but nothing's really stuck yet. I think Minecraft
971000	976280	is still kind of the, the big, big game in that genre and nobody's really topped it yet. So maybe
976280	982840	someday, maybe someday. And me, the 10 year old will make something way better than that stupid
982840	992600	14 year old can make. It's like, call them out. You call them out right here. I love it.
992600	997800	Julian's new handle is going to be shade tree. All right. All right. Well I do, I do, Julian,
997800	1002200	I have to move on to some other topics here, uh, shortly to, to get into our show, but is there,
1002200	1006520	is there anything that you want to tell the gamers out there listening to orange on radio?
1007960	1011880	I can't think of anything. I don't know. That's okay. I usually can't either,
1011880	1017000	but Hey, do me a favor since, you know, you are a kid and I'm, I'm not, uh, you know, sometimes I
1017000	1021320	noticed out there, there's a lot of like negativity about video games out there. And I don't know
1021320	1025880	about you, but I think video games are pretty rad. So I like to try and keep it all positive
1025880	1029160	when we talk about video games, you know, sometimes there's a little thing here and
1029160	1033240	there where you might say, I wish they do this better. Cause this makes me really mad, but
1033240	1037720	I don't like to be mad all the time. So can you help me make sure that like 10 year olds
1037720	1041400	today are gonna like keep it positive with video games and keep this industry fun?
1042680	1048360	I don't think I, I need to tell them, um, to play video games. They're probably already playing at
1048360	1057080	20, um, um, um, 36 hours a day. That is true. Just as long as they're having fun doing it.
1057080	1060920	That's the important part. They're definitely having fun doing it. If they're playing at 36
1060920	1065960	hours a day. Yes. I should have thought of that. Yes. Well, they're playing 36 hours a day. They're
1065960	1071160	also traveling through time as well. So more props to them. They're doing something right.
1071160	1076040	Uh, let's see, Brad from pod culture and chat says, uh, Julian will get his game done before
1076040	1083400	Loki. That is probably true. That joke was like, I saw that joke before we even have the time
1083400	1089480	machine as well. Apparently. Well, I just have, it's predictable joke is predictable. So,
1089480	1094200	and look, you will also have, you know, his tingle costume made and invent the time turner.
1094200	1098120	You know, funny enough, actually that you mentioned the tingle costume because there was,
1098120	1106600	um, what was it? They did a new content cop that was popular on YouTube and Ian actually wears
1106600	1112120	a morph suit, tingle costume. Like, well, there it is. Apparently it does exist. So
1113320	1117960	that is true. I guess it's glad to know, glad to know that is out there. Somebody beat you to it.
1117960	1122760	Uh, one more question in our chat room, act after over at live.vog network.com wants to know
1122760	1127880	when are we giving Julian his own podcast? Uh, any, anytime he wants to do one, we'll,
1127880	1131240	we'll help him get one together. So he'll just have to get some friends together and
1131240	1134920	figure out what they want to talk about. Probably when I'm an adult.
1137480	1142440	Yes. Let's not rush anything. Yes. Let's not rush anything. You need to do is you need to get into
1142440	1147400	like, if you like toys and games and stuff like that, you start a toy and boxing channel, then
1147400	1151480	it just, it's a never ending cycle because you get views and you get, you know what Julian just
1151480	1155080	told you, he's going to do it when he's good and ready right now. He's going to enjoy being a kid.
1155720	1161160	Is that right? We get free toys. Yeah, exactly. I'm missing the point here.
1163960	1168280	This is Julian's show, not your show. If you want to do a free toy show or whatever to get toys,
1168280	1174200	then you, you, you go right ahead and start one. I'm not sure if it's legal for me to have my own
1174200	1181240	show yet. Well, that's true. I know there's four roles that they're on YouTube. I would
1181800	1186920	as long as your mom is aware of what you're doing. That's I think. Okay. She's she's got to open or,
1186920	1191480	you know, as long as somebody approves, she'll never know. I'll make my show in the sewer with
1191480	1197880	my friends. Oh, you're a Ninja turtle now. No. Okay. I don't have a shell.
1201240	1208760	I also speak English. Yeah. Yes. We can make you green. All right. Let's get, let's get into some
1208760	1212520	of the gaming topics from this past week. And Julian, if you do want to jump in at any time,
1212520	1216920	just, you know, shake Jamie and let her know you want the mic. All right. Uh, anyhow, let's talk
1216920	1220760	a little bit about before we get into our gaming weeks, you know, something that happened this past
1220760	1224520	week is the Nintendo world championships. Actually that just happened. What? Like,
1224520	1228200	was it yesterday or day before? You just have something on there. I was like,
1228200	1233080	I thought that happened yesterday. Well, no, the qualifiers, but the big event,
1233080	1237720	like the finals was yesterday. Yeah. I know. I think a lot of people, it's Saturday is a
1237720	1242520	weird day to do it. They advertised it so well. I know. I know. Right. Well, so it was, uh, it
1242520	1247880	was yesterday and they had it in Manhattan at the grand ballroom and it was on YouTube and Twitch,
1247880	1254680	but they also showed it on Disney XD in that DXP, uh, segment that they have on, on the Disney
1254680	1258760	kids channel, or I'm sorry, it's now at all Disney XD or whatever it's called. So they actually
1258760	1262920	showed it on TV. So that's something that the Nintendo championships are actually being shown
1262920	1268120	on TV. Uh, so what happened is that there is, I guess, I guess there was like a, it was like a
1268120	1272280	single elimination tournament and you had like two brackets. So once you got eliminated,
1272280	1277480	you went to the underground and otherwise you were in the above ground. Well, anyway,
1277480	1283320	some of the games that they had to play, let's see, in the above ground stage one was, uh,
1283320	1288440	there was a, like a relay between the legend of Zelda, breath of the wild in a shield surfing
1288440	1294280	race, a high score challenge in the home run contest of Smash Brothers for Wii U and a race
1294280	1300760	in Metroid Samus Returns. Okay. So the top 16 went on to stage two and that was two eight player
1300760	1307720	matches in Super Smash Brothers for Wii U. Stage three was a grand Prix of two races in Mario Kart
1307720	1314200	8 Deluxe. Stage four was a best of three match in Splatoon. And then the final four played one
1314280	1319720	versus one matches in Arms. Meanwhile, in the underground, it was completely different games.
1319720	1326200	Stage one was a high score challenge in Balloon Fight. Yep. 1985 from the NES. Then a stage two
1326200	1331080	was a high score challenge in a game called Bird and Beans, which I never played, but apparently
1331080	1337320	it was inspired by a WarioWare game. Uh, Donkey Kong Country Returns was stage three. Stage four
1337320	1342600	was Tetris for the Game Boy. That's pretty cool. Uh, and then the final underground stage was Mario
1342600	1347800	Party 2, some of the mini games. So you had the, the, the contestant from the underground and the
1347800	1351880	contestant from the above ground. They met in the final, final, final challenge, which was
1352520	1358360	Super Mar... I'm sorry. Super Mario Maker was the first finals game. Super Mario Brothers Deluxe,
1358360	1364440	Mario Odyssey was the big finish at the end. Of course they played a stage that nobody has seen
1364440	1370200	before. And I think we kind of all knew that this whole thing was just a promotion for Mario Odyssey,
1370200	1374200	right? It's a whole promotion for Nintendo stuff. I mean, come on. Yeah, it really was. I mean,
1374200	1379480	they had a lot of newer games in there and it all got screen time on Disney, you know, of all
1379480	1385240	things. So, but hey, I mean, that's come a long way. I don't remember the 1990 championships being
1385240	1388600	on TV. Was it? I think it might've been like covered on TV, but I don't remember it like
1388600	1395000	actually being on TV. And then the 2015 was all during E3. So it was kind of picked up as a part
1395000	1402680	of that, but, uh, yeah. So there you go. Uh, the final winner of the whole event was Thomas G. Uh,
1402680	1408840	and actually the runner up was the 2015 champion, John Numbers. So that's still not bad though,
1408840	1413800	to win two years ago and then be the runner up this year is still pretty good. So there it is,
1413800	1418440	Nintendo world championships. So, I mean, what do you guys think? Is the Nintendo world championships
1418440	1423000	something that Nintendo should be doing regularly or was this kind of a non-factor?
1423000	1427000	All right. I mean, I don't know. It's a fun little hype machine. It's just not,
1427000	1431880	I don't think it has the same draw as it did. Like, you know, back when we were growing up,
1431880	1438120	I mean, it's just kind of now it's very obvious that it's kind of a Nintendo commercial commercial
1438120	1443320	and it's like, Oh, you're the best at like the Nintendo game. Who cares? I mean, no one really,
1443960	1447960	that's what kind of seems like, but it's fine. It's cool to like see the new games and stuff.
1447960	1451480	I thought last year's was a little bit better though. Like, especially when I think there was
1451480	1455880	an internal championships where they did like the blind runs of like some of the Mario maker
1455880	1459960	levels. That was a good way to show up Mario maker. It was, I mean, nowadays though, people
1459960	1464280	do Mario maker runs all the time and it's like, eh, I don't know. Julian, what do you think?
1465080	1474920	I have a question. Okay. What is the, um, what, whatever it's called, the, um, Nintendo
1474920	1479640	championships or whatever. Yeah. The Nintendo world championships. Um, what is that? That's
1479720	1484840	a great question. I guess it's kind of like the Olympics or it's like a tournament,
1484840	1489320	but it's all Nintendo. So it's like a big Nintendo tournament, but it's all those games I just
1489320	1495480	named. It's not one game. You have to be good at every Nintendo game in order to win. Um,
1496520	1501320	the one that I knew the best that you named on the list was legend of Zelda, breath of the wild.
1501320	1507160	I thought I've, um, saw that game was, um, I've wanted that game since he came out, but
1508120	1513960	I don't want to have to buy the, um, Nintendo switch for it, but we, you know,
1515160	1520840	we're probably not going to buy a Wii U. That's all right. You let the games you want to accumulate.
1520840	1525240	And then someday when you do get a switch, maybe, you know, someday way, way down the line,
1525960	1529320	you can get all these games that you've been wanting to play. And then it's like,
1529320	1534520	Oh, you've you're, you'll be busy for the next year. So do you think, do you think you'd want
1534520	1539240	to compete in something like the Nintendo world championships? Was that, is that something you
1539240	1546680	want to do? No, I'll stick with, um, one of the one PVP and my pirate one Oh one world.
1546680	1551560	Okay. Fair enough. Fair. Wait a minute. So you mean if I, if I go online and I play one versus
1551560	1558200	one PVP in some of these games, I might be playing against you. Yes. And also don't,
1558200	1564840	I don't want your level 10. Everyone who's level 70 will harvest you and be you again and again
1565400	1572760	to get, to get a higher rank in PVP. That's not very nice. I know. I know. Level 70 people harvest
1572760	1577560	on the, on the lower level people. They need, they need to stop hating on the lower level.
1577560	1580920	How are you supposed to get to a higher level if they keep picking on you? Perhaps if a developer
1581000	1590040	puts an actual game balancing in it. Um, pretty much, um, what you do is, um, you paint him for
1590040	1596520	no reason. Just kidding. You don't do that. That'll just make them extremely mad. Now,
1596520	1601480	some of the chatters are suggesting, come on, Noel Gus in our chat room says someone show him that
1601480	1606840	eighties movie with Fred Savage. I think you're talking about the wizard monster. I think that
1606840	1612200	he has to play super Mario brothers three. So maybe I played it before. Okay. So you played
1612200	1616280	Mario brothers three. So I don't remember what the wizard is rated, but I can't imagine it was worse
1616280	1620920	than PG. So, uh, you know, maybe that's a movie you should, cause that that's, that's what was
1620920	1625640	out when I was 12 and that's when they hyped super Mario brothers three. It was like the first time
1625640	1630760	the world got to see it was in this movie. It was pretty cool. Okay. It's probably really corny now
1630760	1634600	in retrospect though. Cause a lot of eighties movies, a lot of eighties movies are pretty corny.
1634600	1639960	Do you ever watch movies in the eighties? I don't know. I don't ask, Hey mom, when I'm
1639960	1645160	going to see a movie, when I, when I go see, see a movie, I don't go to, I don't go to my mom and
1645160	1654200	say, Hey, is this movie from a 1980s and nine 1981, 1982, 1983. And then that's fair. You don't
1654200	1661080	judge. You don't judge. That's fair. All right. Oh yeah. I've seen karate kid. Oh, that's the
1661080	1665000	only one you need to see. Let's see. Mom. I want to see the new star Wars. You're going to watch
1665000	1671320	the old Mario brothers and you're going to like it. All right. Let's move on. Before we get into
1671320	1675720	the news this week, let's talk a little bit about our gaming weeks and the types of video games
1675720	1679000	we've been playing this week. Actually, while it's on my mind though, quickly, before I go to
1679000	1684920	dark soccer, I do want to say while Julian and his mom are still here, I do want to say, I did notice
1684920	1691880	that they brought a gift to the studio this week. So I guess this is like a belated celebration
1691880	1697560	cake of some sort, I believe. So, so you, so you, you actually baked a pumpkin spice cake. Am I
1697560	1703960	right? I did. I love you, Rob. I love you too. Anybody who makes me food. That's, that's an
1703960	1708520	amazing gesture. So I want to thank you very much for that. You are quite welcome. That pumpkin spice
1708520	1717160	case. Oh my God. What Trixie and Katya. Okay. I've been doing the happy dance since last night.
1717160	1721560	Okay. It has nothing to do with games. No, but although my understanding is I've been seeing it
1721560	1726040	on Twitter, I guess Trixie is doing something on Twitch TV, like right now, right? Helping
1726040	1730600	raise money for gamer X and that whole that they're doing back East. So that's pretty cool.
1730600	1736760	And Trixie did host at gamer X. Yeah. That was where I met her. Which I met her out of drag.
1736760	1740680	Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So she, cause she was actually hanging out at the parties and stuff. Yep. All
1740680	1745480	right. All right. Well, let's get into our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have
1745480	1751240	been playing this week. Dark soccer. How was your gaming week? Um, semi eventful. I'm working on the
1751240	1758280	DerpyCon, uh, guide again. And this time I've kind of put my foot down on due dates. So I actually
1758280	1765160	have some time to do stuff. And so I am playing Danganronpa V3, which, um, I haven't been able
1765160	1771640	to stream. I'm not going to be able to stream it until I get, um, uh, until I get the book done,
1772200	1777480	but Danganronpa V3 is going to be up for stream in a couple of weeks. You know, once there,
1777480	1784600	I'm sure that spoilers have been spoiled, you know, in a very stinky spoilery manner. Um,
1784600	1790760	I am actually playing animal crossing happy home designer again, because I love that game. I'm
1790760	1798920	playing idle pouring, which is my handheld Ragnarok online. Um, Miitomo, Pokemon Go. Um,
1800520	1808280	crap. I played something else too. Oh yeah. Um, I'm kind of addicted to video solitary again.
1808280	1811240	That's random. Because like I do it while listening to stuff.
1811800	1816840	Okay. Yeah. So that I can keep my hands busy. Yeah. And I pay better attention to it if I'm,
1816920	1821640	cause I'm a very kinesthetic type of learner. Some people knit or crochet. Some people play
1821640	1830120	video solitaire. It's fine. Yeah. And, um, yeah, that's pretty much it. Oh, wait. I take that back.
1830120	1834040	I take that back. Cause we got the thing. I was about to call you out on something I've been
1834040	1838600	seeing all over Facebook. We got the thing. So after last week's show and that whole talk.
1838600	1843000	I said I wasn't going to actively seek one. A super Nintendo classic is what she's talking
1843000	1847800	about. Yes, because we have a friend who gave us the hookup as we got our nest mini.
1847800	1853960	So it's not an act of seeking. It's a, Hey, if you get one. Okay. So it fell from the heavens
1853960	1859320	onto your lap. So you were like, if I must, I will take this. Even though there's people everywhere
1859320	1863480	fighting in the streets and on eBay for one of these, somehow one magic, fuck them. They're not
1863480	1870920	me. Somehow one magically fell into your lap and you, you said, okay, if I must, I'll play this
1871160	1875880	Nintendo classic. So we played, um, of course the first thing we played on it was star Fox
1875880	1881080	so that we could unlock star Fox too. Yep. And then Dan beat star Fox too. Oh wow. Yeah. Cause
1881080	1884680	you can beat that real fast. Yeah, you can different ways, but you have to, you know,
1884680	1888520	go through and prevent like corner area from being destroyed and all this stuff.
1888520	1892680	And I had remembered playing like a ROM way back, but it was more like a level select version. So
1892680	1900040	it was really not very polished rough. Yeah. Um, but I still remembered the level warp trick
1900120	1904760	in the first star Fox where in your second level you go into the asteroid. Oh yeah. You
1904760	1910680	shoot the face. Not quite. You have these rotating. There's, there's five of them. Yeah.
1910680	1915080	And the middle one's gold. You shoot each of those and fly through the, uh, the debris.
1915640	1919960	And then slightly to the left, you're going to get one meteor that has a face on it and you run into
1919960	1926360	it. Right. And it's like a really, it looks like it looks like the moon from Majora's mask. It
1926360	1930920	does. It does look like that. It does. And then you get to do like the skip to like, that's when
1930920	1935320	you go to the black hole, the black hole, and then you go to like sector Y or something. Yeah.
1935320	1941720	One of those sectors anyway. Um, and then, um, we played a Super Mario world last night.
1942440	1946760	Um, a little off and on. I, I'm not as good at that game as I used to be. Although I did like
1946760	1952760	some, you know, just a few things on instinct, you know, like flipping the P block and taking
1952760	1960360	it to the, you know, all that. Um, and, uh, we actually got to like through the whole vanilla
1960360	1964840	dome area, you know, just me and Dan and he's been playing Super Mario Kart, which that game
1964840	1971800	makes me violently ill. Um, why is that just the rough, some of the mode seven games like F zero
1971800	1978280	will do that to me as well. Um, but, um, you know, it's also why I have actually have the same
1978280	1983800	problem with, um, some of the Sonic bonus stages, like the ones where you run and hit the balls.
1983800	1989320	Yeah. Oh, even I get like, oh, stop running back and forth. Yeah. Well, and the, um, and the,
1989320	1993880	the bonus level where you're in like the, the bouncy house with all the blocks and everything.
1993880	1998360	That's my one complaint about Sonic mania is that you run into those bonus stages and like
1998360	2001320	half the game. I mean, you can skip them, but it's like when I was for, you know, you just
2001320	2005720	instinctively keep going into the bonus round. I'm like, all I'm doing is the stupid bonus round.
2005720	2009720	One thing that's a little disappointing is that the ROM for super Mario world is the
2010280	2013480	cartridge ROM and not the all-stars one that had the different Luigi.
2014600	2017960	Um, and it certainly isn't the Japanese one cause you can't eat the, um, dolphins.
2019160	2026760	Right. But I'm trying to get Dan to set aside some time with me so that we can play through,
2026760	2035080	um, secret mana. Okay. Oh, I also played, um, uh, the, the Kirby all-stars. I just sat down
2035080	2039000	and played the first one until I got, you know, my hands started hurting because I think my
2039000	2043880	ganglion cyst is coming back and it makes me sad. So, so you're enjoying it despite, and Bobby is
2043880	2047720	saying very tongue in cheek in our chat room. What happened to, I don't need it because I have all
2047720	2053080	the games on it anyway. Because I didn't technically go out and buy it. Dan sent me a picture
2053080	2057240	and said, look what we have, but now that you have it in your house, it was kind of like, oh,
2057240	2061640	this is fun to go back and play all these games again. Well, the thing that I actually specifically
2061640	2067720	like about it is playing it on our 4k TV without lag. Okay. Because we can't hook up. And to be
2067720	2071480	fair, you did call that out last week. It's like the reason why you would want to get one.
2071480	2076120	Exactly. And that I actually don't think I own, um, either of those Kirby games now that I think
2076120	2080840	about it. I don't think that we own those. So it was nice to go back and play a game I haven't
2080840	2086200	touched in, you know, 25 years. So, um, you know, all the rest of them have definitely played more
2086200	2091560	recently than that. Um, shoot, even star Fox two have played more recently than that, but, um, it
2091560	2097960	was, it was neat, you know, um, it's so tiny, it's cute. I took a picture of it on like a real SNES
2097960	2102760	and it was adorable. And, but the thing that is kind of neat is that you, you peel back
2103320	2108840	the controller ports to plug in the little USB controllers. And so that's pretty neat,
2108840	2113800	but I think that the primary thing is just that it makes it easy for some of these games, um,
2113800	2119000	just to play them in the front room where we don't have that, that lag, you know,
2119000	2123800	imagine trying to play street fighter with at least one to two seconds of lag. Yeah. You can't
2123800	2129400	do it horrible. Yeah. Uh, come on. No Gus in chat is sticking up for you saying a lady can change
2129400	2135880	her mind. It's my prerogative. I can do what I want to do. That's right. Nobody can tell me what
2135880	2141320	to do. And I just quoted Bobby Brown. I know, or, or Brittany, depending on what decade you were
2141320	2146040	growing up in. All right. Uh, well, well, well, Julian, I got to check in with you, buddy. Um,
2146040	2149960	I know you, you play the pirate one Oh one. Is there anything this week that you've been playing
2149960	2157000	specifically? This is like your fave, huh? Um, yeah, I've been playing the game since I, what,
2157000	2162440	six or seven. Oh, so, Oh, okay. So you've been playing this for like half your life almost.
2162680	2169640	Yeah. Um, I played undertale this week a little. Okay. Um, no.
2172760	2178040	Yeah. Minecraft. We need to get you on danganronpa. What's that? Is that a game that he should play?
2179240	2183080	It's got some themes in it that are a little dark. Well, I, uh, I,
2183800	2190280	Hey, do you know who his mother is? I ain't the parent or the BFF parent. So y'all that's y'all's
2190280	2194760	decision, but okay. No, he probably shouldn't play danganronpa. That's what I thought. All right.
2196280	2205000	I just thought of, um, a great pun. So what, what do you call, um, what was the video game that
2205000	2209720	everyone is arguing about in the neighborhood? What is the video game that everybody's arguing
2209720	2213240	about in the neighborhood? I don't know what street fighter.
2221240	2224600	Good night, everybody. We'll be back to do this again in seven days. I hope you all have a
2224600	2231560	wonderful week. You've been listening to orange lounge radio. All right. Anyway, no, it's good.
2231560	2235320	That was good. You're going to go places, kid. It's pretty soon. You're going to have to charge
2235320	2239880	people a two drink minimum. I'm just, I'm just having a Zorak quote going to my head.
2240520	2243240	Somebody better slap a muzzle on that scale down piece of evil.
2243240	2249480	Okay. I just, I just have a request someday when this show inevitably ends,
2249480	2254120	cause this show is going to have some day. Never. I want Julian to send the show off.
2254120	2258680	That's that's, that's my one. I don't even care if he's like 23,
2259480	2263320	he's got to come back and send the show off appropriately. It's my one request.
2265400	2271160	Fair. Is that deal? I don't know. It's 13 years in the future. It could happen.
2271160	2275880	It could not happen. I could be dead by then, but let's not get morbid kid. All right.
2276920	2281800	I should hope not. I'm sure you're gonna have a long, full life. All right. Anyhow.
2282760	2288600	You all right? No, I just was warning him. Oh yeah. Sorry. The mic doesn't have a lot of slack
2288600	2293000	on it to get all the way over there. So. All right. Anyway. And we're not slackers. Haha.
2293000	2296280	All right. Uh, let's see. How about Loki? Loki, how was your gaming week? What'd you play?
2296280	2301960	Um, I played cuphead. That was kind of the most of what I played this week.
2301960	2304760	Is it as hard as advertised? Cause I haven't started it yet.
2304760	2309640	It's not a super hard. Did you sit there and scream at it? Like I just imagine you doing
2309640	2312680	no, I didn't scream on it because it's just like playing like an old,
2312680	2317000	so you have to understand when people say it's a hard game now it's because they're older and they
2317000	2320920	they're not as skills. They used to be when they were younger, like playing games from like the
2320920	2325240	eighties. So it's about that difficulty. It's just very technical. So you just,
2325240	2329080	it's not unfair. You just have to be precise in what you do. That's it.
2329080	2334200	I have not played cuphead yet, but I, it is sitting waiting to be streamed after tonight's
2334200	2339880	show me playing for the first time. So gorgeous game. I mean, I really like it. So, um, I haven't
2339880	2346920	played too much of it yet, but I do enjoy it. Um, so definitely worth picking up. Um, then of
2346920	2352920	course I actually went to the store and I saw that they had a Mario Odyssey demo at the kiosk.
2352920	2358280	So I got to try that out. And I got to say that, um, playing the switch with like the joy con
2358280	2365960	separated is the most uncomfortable thing I've had to deal with. I hate that so much. Um,
2365960	2370280	but I think like a pro controller or like it actually docked into the screen or something
2370280	2374040	might be a little bit better, but it was just weird. I just did not like it. It wasn't as
2374040	2378440	comfortable as like the Wii remote in nunchuck. I think it's because they tried to make those so
2378440	2383480	small, but other than that, I mean, Mario honestly is a gorgeous game. I mean, I would
2383480	2390040	love to pick it up, but $400, man, that's pretty expensive. So what three or 400, I don't know,
2390040	2393320	still a few hundred dollars. The games are starting to add up though. Like, you know,
2393320	2397560	the things that are worth buying on the switch, I would think, but yeah, I mean, it's a good,
2397560	2403080	it's a good console, I guess, but like what I really pay all that money for Mario Odyssey,
2403960	2409880	maybe, I don't know. It's just not right now. I don't know. We'll see. We'll see.
2410840	2414520	And then aside from that, just, I've been playing a little bit of the, um,
2415800	2420920	office space idle clicker game, which they keep adding crap to it to make it more kind of grindy
2421640	2426680	and I'm not quite like now I did hit a hundred the other week or whatever. So I'm kind of done
2426680	2431240	with the game, but then they added more to it. So you kind of start all over and then there's like
2431240	2434200	four buildings that you're trying to go through instead of just the one.
2435400	2439320	And I don't know. It just seems very like cash grab. It's a free to play game. So it's supposed
2439320	2445720	to be very obvious cash grab, but it's just kind of like each week let's find ways to screw the
2445720	2450280	player over even more. It's I don't know. It's just kind of, I'm not playing it as much. I'm
2450280	2455080	kind of going that route. They went with Pokemon and Ingress where it's like kind of slowly phasing
2455080	2459960	it out. Okay. We'll see. All right. That's it. All right. Well, my gaming week, I haven't,
2459960	2464520	I haven't played an awful lot because I guess, I guess I can confess about this on the show.
2464520	2467480	I haven't done, I haven't done one of these games in like eight or nine years,
2467480	2471240	but one of my friends from back in the day, like was it tried to convince me like, Hey Rob,
2471240	2475880	you should play my game. That's like one of these like online, like big brother type of competitions,
2475880	2480360	like the TV show, but it's all on Facebook. So, and before you judge me for this type of stuff,
2480360	2485160	like it's no different than like role-playing on forums or anything like that. Live journal.
2485160	2487800	Yeah. I was doing this back in the day. That was the last time I did it was back in,
2487880	2491720	back in the day when live was still around. So one of my friends that I met in those days was like,
2491720	2495800	he, he'd been bugging me about it for a while, but I was like, no, I can't do it because I'm doing
2495800	2499400	four podcasts a week. No, I can't do it cause I'm doing two podcasts a week. And now it's like,
2499400	2504360	Oh, I guess I only have the one show. So as long as nothing big happens on Sundays, I guess I can
2504360	2509400	do it. So, so that's been taken a lot of my time though, because that's a very, you know, social
2509400	2513640	type of thing where you have to talk to a lot of people. So, uh, yeah, that's, that's been taking
2513640	2518600	up a lot of my time, but I have been trying to do a few video games here and there and namely the
2518600	2523800	super Nintendo classic. Of course, I finally had to plug that in and play that getting that Friday.
2523800	2530040	So like Jamie, the first thing I did was play star Fox so I could unlock star Fox too. And, uh, when
2530040	2535640	I played star Fox too, I have to admit, I was kind of like, man, it's really not that good.
2535640	2541240	Yeah. That's kind of what I was looking at. I was like, the Walker areas are bizarre. Here's
2541240	2546680	the thing. Here's the thing. If that game had come out at that time, it would have been awesome.
2546680	2554520	But the technology with the FX chip and that type of 3d gaming, it hasn't aged gracefully. You know,
2554520	2560840	it's still very polygon and you really notice like the low frame rate on these games. And look,
2560840	2565640	I'm not, I'm not raising it because. You know, that was what it was in the nineties. And at
2565640	2570680	that time it blew our minds because we hadn't seen anything like it, but it just, I actually
2570680	2577960	would argue that something like super Mario cart has aged better than star Fox has. I think
2577960	2582520	I do like the dogfight levels though. Those were pretty neat. Yeah. It was kind of one of the
2582520	2587240	things I'd always wanted in star Fox from the get-go, uh, dark Tetsuya and Chad over at live.vog
2587240	2592040	network.com says seems like most reviewers are comparing it to today's games. Yeah. I heard
2592040	2597160	about that. Like some big website gave it a five out of 10 and stuff. I don't, I just, I'm not sure
2597160	2605960	star Fox two can be reviewed appropriately today. Like it's a brand new game in 2017. I mean,
2606840	2610520	it's a bone to why it's necessary to review the game, but that's what I'm saying is that,
2610520	2615080	well, you can, I think it's fine to do like a review. Well, I'm if it's your website,
2615080	2619560	you do whatever the heck you want, but I would think like if it's, if it was for vog network,
2619560	2624920	let's say, I think I would just do an unscored review, like an impressions type of thing. And
2624920	2630200	you know, this is how I feel about star Fox two in 2017. It's cool that I got to play it.
2630200	2634600	It's cool that they unearthed something out of the archive. I wish Nintendo would do this more
2634600	2641080	often, but that all being said, this is a great thing for a museum, but not something I'm going
2641080	2645480	to be like, Oh, I got to run home and play star Fox two. I think we also have to look at it though,
2645480	2651400	through the lens of, you know, what it was built for the time it was built for. Yeah,
2651480	2657400	no. And like I'm saying, like as a, as a museum, as a study of the super Nintendo back in the day,
2657400	2662840	as a, what essentially would have been one of the final releases on the super Nintendo,
2662840	2668520	you know, it's, I'm great that it exists for people to see that, but like as a, this is going
2668520	2673960	to be my 40 hours of entertainment this week, instead of playing final fantasy 15 or something,
2674520	2680200	probably not. So I don't know. That's how I feel about it. Anyway, uh, SSG100 Matt and chat over
2680200	2684920	at live.vognetware.com says, seems like society feels the need to tear down and pick apart
2684920	2690120	everything. Doesn't matter what it is. Yeah. I mean, I can sit here and go star Fox two
2690120	2694760	isn't that great. It didn't age well, but I can still respect it for what it was trying to do
2694760	2698600	at the time and what it means to the super Nintendo. And I think the elements from that
2698600	2704200	went into the star Fox assault. Yeah. There are pieces of that that influenced future star Fox
2704200	2708040	games for sure. That's what I like about it though. But I'm really hoping that beta 64 does
2708040	2714200	a new video about it, where they go through, um, that semi pre-released one that was online,
2714200	2719400	that wasn't translated and do a comparison to see how complete it was. Now I'm kind of sitting and
2719400	2724360	purposely waiting to dive into final fantasy three and secret of mana, because I think those would
2724360	2728360	make better streams. So I'm kind of waiting to do some streams of those, but I have been trying to
2728360	2734520	play some of the other games. Uh, I played street fighter two turbo and, uh, is it like, I can't
2734520	2739640	do any of the moves. Like what happened? Like I'm, I'm in the game trying to do like Chun-Li
2739640	2744440	kick, kick, kick, or, or she can throw a fireball in this one. Right. No, she doesn't have the key
2744440	2749080	close show in this one. I thought she got that in turbo. No. Yeah. She got it in, um, super.
2749720	2753160	Oh, she got in super. No wonder I couldn't do the fireball, but I couldn't even do the spinning
2753160	2757080	bird kick or any of that stuff. And I was like, what? And then I switched over to Ryu and I was
2757080	2761560	able to throw a fireball, but like I couldn't do anything else. It was like, I know how to do the
2761560	2767240	moves. It's like, what happened? I got to the end with, um, Ken and he couldn't beat him with Ken.
2767240	2772360	So he switched to Ryu and beat the game, but Ryu wasn't there because the fight is everything.
2772360	2776760	I wasn't, wait a minute. But Ryu and Ken are practically the same. Um, speed is a little
2776760	2782200	different. Yeah. I get, and, and I think Ken gets a little more on the Shoryuken and Ryu gets a
2782200	2786120	little more on the fireball. Right. Yeah. And I think he's got a better throw. I think that's
2786120	2790760	the other thing too. He's got a stronger throw. I guess that's true. So, all right. Yeah. Uh,
2790760	2795160	okay. Thank you. Dark Tetsuya says she has it in turbo. It's a different motion though.
2795160	2798600	That's what I thought. She had like the tiny little fireball and then they like really
2798600	2803480	changed the look of it. I thought it was a charge move. I can't remember. I thought you
2803480	2807160	had to roll a half circle. No, I thought hers was a charge move. I thought it was a half circle.
2808040	2811400	Any, well, any, whatever it is, I tried both and I can't do it. And I was like,
2811400	2816840	is this just cause I'm old? Like what's going on? You can always check the manual. Do they have a
2816840	2821720	manual in the game or is it a link online? We also have this other thing called the internet
2821720	2827560	or game facts or, you know, probably just ask Siri, you know, Hey Siri, how do I throw a
2827560	2833720	fireball? Take some gasoline in a match and some cotton balls. Uh, Dark Tetsuya in chat says it
2833720	2838760	was a charge motion in super street fighter two. So, uh, that's always how I was used to doing it.
2838760	2842040	Yeah. That's why I was used to it too, but that's cause they changed it later. But anyway,
2842040	2847640	all that stuff aside. Oh yes. Um, I know how to do the, um, fireball. So what you do is you take
2847640	2856280	the controller and press some buttons in a certain order and it will work. Thanks kid. I'll try that
2856920	2863880	later on. Cause it's not working for me so far. All right. That's it. I'm going to challenge the
2863880	2868120	boy to street fighter. That's right. You should, you should school, you should school this kid on
2868120	2873080	street fighter and then we'll see. We'll see what he has to say next week. Oh, Julia's played
2873080	2879320	strip. Who's your favorite in street fighter. Julia. Who's that character that can do the
2879320	2886520	fireball, but all has the weird stretchy limbs. I think you're thinking of, um, um, I know a lot
2886520	2890760	of people that are terrible playing him. He's my best character. All right, cool. It's all seems
2890760	2896360	cool. Like yoga, fire yoga, that guy. Right. Yoga flame. I think, I think it's, um, isn't her name
2897000	2906680	Chung Lee. Um, um, she's, I'm also, I'm gonna, um, playing on her, but I, do you know what the
2906680	2913960	most popular move in treat fighter is? What's that? Hadouken. Yes it is. Yes. I think everybody
2913960	2918360	knows. I think Hadouken is probably in the Webster dictionary at this point. Very well. I'm curious.
2918360	2922600	I'm going to look that up. All right. Well, while you look that up, cheap bitch move. All right.
2923480	2928760	We need to get to, uh, some quick announcements. Follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R.
2928760	2935080	We're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio. Uh, we'll be here for the next few
2935080	2939720	weeks. We might be off in early November. I'll fill you guys all in on that. Hopefully I'll know
2939720	2945240	that for sure in the next two weeks. Can we fill it in with cream? Whatever. Like when you have a
2945320	2949560	night off custard cream, you can spend it. However you like, you can bake with Becky. She's next.
2949560	2955880	I can't bake for shit. That's why I have Becky because Becky can bake for shit and she can bake
2955880	2963240	for other things too. Fair enough. Fair enough. All right. Let's get stuff though. Let's get to
2963240	2968680	some gaming news. We got more to dump. Jump into Loki. Well, it's a little bicep with Jamie. It
2968680	2973240	just doesn't have the same ring to it as big with Beth. It really doesn't. It really doesn't.
2973880	2978120	Um, I could do a shopping show since we were talking about street fighter. Um,
2978120	2983720	I guess you guys should know that street fighter five is getting an arcade edition. Yes. It's
2983720	2988840	coming out January 16th on PlayStation four and PC. Now what is this going to be? Well,
2988840	2994760	it's 39 99 and includes an arcade mode. Pretty straightforward since it is arcade edition,
2995400	3001880	extra battle mode, some V trigger moves, uh, gallery and new user interface and seasons one
3001880	3006760	and two DLC content. I don't care if Sakura is not playable. So this is the game of the
3006760	3013400	year edition basically. Am I, am I right? It's a game this year or next year. Oh yeah. I guess,
3013400	3016920	I guess street fighter five can't really call itself the game of the year. They can just call
3016920	3024120	it a game from the game we release and now we're releasing this other edition that's got stuff in
3024120	3030520	it. It's the, you tried collection. I don't care if Sakura is not playable. It's just buy this one
3030520	3035080	so you don't have to buy all the extra DLC cause you know the one that you should have waited for
3035080	3040120	the buy until they released the ultimate arcade edition or whatever bullshit. Am I not, am I not
3040120	3045240	mistaken that in the very beginning they said when they first put out street fighter five,
3045240	3051160	Oh, we're not going to do those types of collections because you know, this is it.
3051160	3055000	This is the definitive street fighter five and we want it to be, you know, something that,
3055000	3058840	you know, we add on to, I don't know, whatever the line was, they gave us a few months ago
3058840	3062440	that we all knew fit in a version of street fighter five except none of the characters
3062440	3066040	are out. So we're going to have to keep releasing those as we go on. So it'll be the,
3066040	3075960	it'll be as definitive as the last piece of DLC. Um, uh, do you think, uh, what's going to happen
3075960	3079720	to the people that already own street fighter five? Are they gonna, they get an update I
3079720	3084440	believe. Okay. So they get like, so you get, if you, you own street fighter five, you get
3084440	3089800	everything except for the DLC cause that you have to buy. Okay. Act deft and check,
3089800	3094360	correcting me a little bit here saying they said that they were not going to do different versions
3094360	3099160	of street fighter five, which is true. We're not getting a different version. So he's,
3099160	3105160	he meaning like it's a different edition. It's not street fighter five ultra or turbo or super ultra
3105160	3113000	turbo max for dancing stage. Yes. All right. True kiss destination. Time for that. I think
3113080	3116440	you're looking for for matching service for matching service. That's what I was trying
3116440	3120680	to think of. All right. Uh, Julian, you get to pick up street fighter five. Um,
3122040	3129400	I have no idea, but, um, so when I, when I play against someone in street fighter,
3129400	3140440	which is usually my family members, um, I hate when people spam the same attack over and over
3140440	3145720	and over again, like someone goes up to you and says, how do we can, how do we can, and then you
3145720	3151560	cannot get to them because the little, um, timer of where you can't move after the attack, they
3151560	3157320	just keep doing it. And it's so annoying when they just spam an attack. And that is why I said that
3157320	3162600	was the cheap bitch move. I was going to say, I didn't know if I could, if I should say that in
3162600	3167880	front of a 10 year old, but, but sometimes we call that being a little bitch and people should stop
3167960	3175800	doing that. Yeah. Remember the rule for fighting games. Don't be that bitch. Let's see. How dare
3175800	3182840	you? How dare you in chat room? There's people in chat room going, Julian, get good. You have
3182840	3189160	anything to say to that Julian? Get good Julian. What do they mean by that? They mean you just,
3189160	3192520	you got to try harder. You got to get better at the game so you can get around that stuff.
3192520	3202520	Um, I, um, say to that, let me do what I want in video game is so shut up.
3206920	3209000	Get this boy a Twitter account. All right.
3212040	3215960	Well said actually. And actually some of the people that were saying that, which by the way
3215960	3220600	was tongue in cheek, they didn't really mean it. They say, well said, well said, Julian, well said.
3220600	3226120	All right. All right. Moving on. Let's talk about Pokemon. Uh, we're gonna talk about Pokemon ultra
3226120	3231400	sun and ultra moon, which got a little more information this week. Do the kids like Pokemon
3231400	3234520	Julian? I'm surprised you didn't bring that up. I thought kids love Pokemon.
3235880	3243000	He's making a face. No one plays Pokemon anymore. Um, not so much at school, but when I still,
3243000	3249240	when I went to daycare two days ago, um, I stopped going to daycare two days ago.
3249240	3256760	So, um, um, um, every single day, um, sort of bring their Pokemon cards and say,
3256760	3260280	did you get a new mega yet today or something like that? Or go like,
3260280	3264040	Hey, did you bring your Pokemon cards? You didn't bring your Pokemon cards. I,
3264040	3269720	you said we'd have a battle today. And, um, those kids sound like nerds.
3269720	3275720	Oh, aren't all of us.
3277240	3281240	Yes. Especially the people listening to this show. Right. Julian probably.
3283080	3284440	And they're bored.
3290040	3295880	But, um, I do have Pokemon moon. I don't have Pokemon ultra mega ex moon.
3295880	3298040	Well, no one does yet. It's coming out soon.
3300040	3305240	Um, I have Pokemon moon. I also know, um, some people that have sun and moon, but
3306680	3311880	there's only two people, um, that, um, when that went to the daycare that, um, had, um,
3313080	3322120	uh, the new Pokemon, which was me and, um, Ethan C I know five Ethan's Ethan C Ethan T Ethan P.
3322760	3331640	Um, um, um, Ethan Yee, Ethan B. You're just, you're just throwing letters out there. These
3331640	3339240	people don't exist. So if anyone's curious, Ethan is the common name for this particular.
3339880	3343960	I know a ton of mats. I know, like I'll have, I know a ton of friends. I have some friends
3343960	3347800	that are named Matt. That's why we call this one Loki. So we can tell them apart from the other
3347800	3353160	mats. So, you know, maybe you need to come up with other nicknames for your Ethan's,
3353160	3355560	but I mean, if you want to use their last initial, I guess that works too.
3356120	3365560	So to prove that they exist, Ethan, um, B's last name is we don't give out people's names on the
3365560	3370680	show. We don't like to give out because we don't want anyone to find out are creepy.
3370680	3373480	We don't want them to get new friends that they don't want.
3373480	3375320	Exactly. Exactly.
3377000	3382520	Don't be creepy and stop buying your ads into other people's business, please.
3382520	3386360	Thank you. Yeah, that's not going to work. Listen to the kid. All right. Well, anyhow,
3386360	3392200	what can you expect in Pokemon ultra sun and ultra moon? There will be new ultra beasts
3392200	3400280	with the beast wise from your grave. Uh, there will be a new ultra beast that will have the
3400280	3405800	ability to travel through ultra wormholes to go beyond just Alola. And that's what I,
3405800	3408840	that's what I thought was weird. When I started seeing all the promotion for this game, I was
3408840	3412680	like, what happened to like the Hawaii thing? Like Alola was basically Hawaii, right? I was like,
3412680	3416440	what happened to the Hawaii thing? And now I'm looking at all the graphics and I'm like, well,
3417080	3422600	it does look kind of cool because it kind of looks like Tron now. Like they got like,
3422600	3427640	Pokemon got all warped to Tron world. So I might be here for that. So anyway,
3427960	3432840	it all is going to focus around the Pokemon necro. I'm probably gonna mispronounce this name.
3432840	3437560	Necrozma is the Pokemon. That's kind of the centerpiece of the story. Um,
3438440	3446360	who, uh, has taken over a legendary Pokemon, Solgaleo and Lunala. And, uh, so no, not Ulala,
3446360	3451960	that's different, but anyway, uh, Necrozma has different forms called dusk main Necrozma and
3451960	3457960	Dawn wings Necrozma. And so ultra beasts can be battled on their home turf. What is this? A
3457960	3463000	square Enix game? I know, right. Actually the way the plot gets all complicated, it kind of does
3463000	3466840	like, I was like, what's this? Kingdom hearts. I was like, Pokemon need like a kingdom hearts guy
3466840	3471720	in the kingdom hearts territory with all these weird names and like versions. But Kingdom hearts
3471720	3475160	is one of those games where it's like, I don't understand it. Even though this game is for
3475160	3480680	children, we're really missing these at the end of the title, you know, it's, you know, we need a
3480680	3489080	random fraction number. Oh, Pokemon ultra sun, moon one, three 65 days. True kiss destination
3489080	3497080	for a matching remix. Yeah. With knuckles. Yes. And knuckles and tails. All right. Anyhow,
3497080	3501560	uh, Pokemon, I I'll still check it out even, even though I'm kind of making fun of it very
3501560	3506840	tongue in cheek, it's like, ah, it's Pokemon and it's Tron ish. So I'm on board. Poketron.
3507480	3514920	Yes. Poketron. Exactly. Dark Sakura. What do you have for us? Um, I have things that should be a
3514920	3523720	big fat duh, but it's not duh because we have assholes in the world. Um, Bethesda had a, uh,
3523720	3529160	for their Wolfenstein production, uh, not production, but promotion or, uh, using
3529160	3535160	make America Nazi free again with the hashtag no more Nazis, which should be fine. Except people
3535160	3541480	actually took offense to it. Like, Oh, they're all SJW men. We're not going to do that anymore.
3541480	3549080	Like, why is it a bad thing to tell Nazis to fuck off? I was like, since, since when was Wolfenstein
3549080	3557480	not about eliminating Nazis and fighting Hitler. That's why people played Wolfenstein 3d,
3557480	3563800	because you got to fight Hitler and you got to punch him in the face with rockets and stuff.
3563800	3570360	And so always punch Nazis. So I'm not sure why. I mean, that's just a kind of a sick sign of,
3570360	3575080	I think the times we live in, in some ways that now all of a sudden it's like, Oh, what this like,
3575080	3580840	okay, look, if you're going to take issue with the game because it's violent. Okay. That's one thing,
3581480	3588120	but just like, there's a quote here. That's not what I'm hearing is, is the issue. These,
3588120	3593160	these Twitter ultra beasts are, uh, for lack of a better term are coming up with, there's a quote
3593160	3599240	here that I like, um, from Pete Hines, who's the vice president of marketing and PR is basically
3599240	3605160	supporting their campaign saying Wolfenstein has been a decidedly anti-Nazi series since the first
3605160	3609640	release more than 20 years ago. We aren't going to shy away from what the game is about. We don't
3609640	3614200	feel it's a reach for us to say Nazis are bad and un-American. And we're not worried about being on
3614200	3619800	the right side of history here. There's definitely some tongue and cheekness to the advertising
3619800	3624520	that's going on though, and playing into what's going on in the real world. And the other thing
3624520	3629400	is that they said it was pretty much a coincidence that Wolfenstein II the new Colossus was a
3629400	3635320	coincidence because no one really expected to have real life Nazis marching in the streets, you know?
3636600	3648120	So at the same time, I think that it's, we shouldn't have to, no, just stop. All of you stop.
3648200	3653640	You're terrible. Nintendo is allowing a Wolfenstein game on their system.
3654520	3663320	Nintendo is fine with it. So I think that says a lot right there. Oh my God. But I like this quote,
3663320	3669960	when it comes to Nazis, you can put us down in the against column. I think that's a very... As
3669960	3675480	everyone should be. It's kind of, it's, what does it say that like a video game company has to come
3675480	3681720	out and say that, and that there's a lot of people that are like, why yes, that is something
3681720	3687880	I support. No shit that you support that, but yet you have to come out and say that. And so
3687880	3694600	it kind of blows my mind. It's just terrible. I mean, do you not remember that these are people
3694600	3702040	who killed 10 million plus people all because they didn't fit into their little white blonde
3702040	3707560	category, right? Remember that? No, you don't, because your grandparents were busy fighting
3707560	3714920	against that. So fuck off and die. I'm sorry, if you're a Nazi, fuck off and die. All right.
3715720	3721080	In that order, because the fucking off part is important. Thank you for clarifying. All right,
3721080	3727720	let's move on. Something a little bit more... Less Nazi. Yeah, less Nazi. Loki. I wouldn't say
3727720	3733160	they're less Nazis because they sure as have a Nazi policy when it comes to cross-platform play,
3733160	3739240	but knock it off. Hey, that's my transition. Don't you fuck it up. Fine. Anyways, so PlayStation
3739240	3746600	4 had their 5.0 firmware come out and what did it do? I'm sure totally exciting things. Well,
3747480	3753320	somewhat exciting things, I guess. So for example, they had, now you can, if you have a PlayStation
3753320	3759560	4 Pro, you can stream in 1080p and 60 FPS. Of course, with that, they kind of tweak the way
3759560	3764280	that they are doing their accounts. So you can have accounts marked as like children accounts,
3764280	3769880	and you can have adults that can basically include different parental controls for each account
3769880	3775000	and more managing the way those family accounts are handled. Also, they are saying that they've
3775000	3781880	included some improvements to the suspend resume as well as uploading clips to Twitter.
3781880	3787480	And you can broadcast to YouTube and they also add folders and that type of stuff.
3788200	3794200	So that's cool, I guess. I haven't been in my PlayStation 4 for a while, so I haven't actually
3794200	3801160	gotten to try that out yet. Now, this is another thing that I was kind of, well, not upset,
3801160	3805240	but I was just like, oh man, you know, I kind of knew this was going to happen, but there's going
3805240	3810840	to be some tweaks coming to the PlayStation VR hardware. So they are releasing a different
3810840	3816280	processor unit, which is basically, it's not the headset itself, it's more of the box that
3816280	3824120	basically is in between the PlayStation 4 and your headset. So what it does now, because one of the
3824120	3830200	issues was that they weren't able to pass through an HDR signal through the box. You had to kind of
3830200	3834200	unhook it and hook it back up or do like a splitter or something like that in order to get
3834200	3839640	to work. Well, now the new box actually includes an HDMI pass through for the HDR.
3840200	3845240	So that's kind of neat. And then of course, also now they're tweaking the headset slightly to
3846040	3851560	add the headfoot integration directly into the headset versus like separate.
3852440	3857800	So if I wait to buy the VR headset till this Christmas or whatever holiday, it sounds like
3857800	3861720	there's going to be less crap because that's one thing that annoyed me about the VR headset is
3861720	3867000	there's all this stuff. Like it's like my, my house is a mess already. I don't need more cords.
3867000	3872280	It's it's not so, I mean, I don't know. It basically, they're saying that it's,
3872280	3877240	it's just, you know, a little bit, a little bit more cleaned up. It's not like a huge
3877240	3882120	improvement. I don't think it's just an improvement. It's in yes. Okay. I'll take it.
3882120	3885320	I'll take it. And I don't want to, I don't want to sound ridiculous that like, I'm going to let
3885320	3889240	a few cords stop me from getting into VR, but it certainly has been a thing where I've kind of
3889240	3895400	looked at it and gone, that's going to be a lot to store. Honestly, the integration with the heads
3895400	3899880	headphones right now is not a huge deal because like they have it. It's on the court, but yeah,
3899880	3904440	it does get a little bit tangled. I guess if you're taking the headset on and off,
3904440	3908920	it is better than if it's just plugged straight in the headset versus the cord that's attached
3908920	3915400	to the headset. So I mean, I guess that's nice, but it's, I don't know. I don't feel the need.
3915480	3918760	Like I don't need to sell mine and like buy a new one or something like that.
3918760	3924440	Okay. All right. All right. Well, moving on to talk about discord. I don't know if you guys
3924440	3930440	are using discord. You should be because a VoG network has a discord and we use that to keep in
3930440	3933880	touch with our listeners throughout the week. You can even submit stories. Some of the stories on
3933880	3938760	tonight's show were submitted by people on our discord. And, you know, I, I don't see Loki and
3938760	3942520	Jamie on there a lot, but I try to get on there and I actually respond to stuff. So, and so forth.
3942520	3945560	You can kind of chat with us throughout the week. It's kind of, kind of what we have instead
3945560	3950120	of forums now. I mean, yes, there are forums, but people actually are using discord. So you
3950120	3954680	can check that out over at vognetwork.com slash discord, uh, that, that will get you,
3954680	3958440	you're invited pops you right over into the discord. But anyway, the reason why I bring
3958440	3963240	up discord is not just the cheap plug, but the fact that discord is rolling out more features.
3963240	3969240	In fact, what's happening now is that the, uh, video chat is now available to everybody.
3969240	3975160	So you can do video chat in one-to-one calls or with up to 10 people in a direct messaging group,
3975160	3980040	you can switch between your webcam video and screen share. So that's pretty cool.
3980040	3984200	I think that's going to be a great thing too for Twitch broadcasters is that if you wanted to do
3984200	3989160	like a broadcast with several other people and maybe actually be able to show their screens
3989160	3992760	when they play and so forth, it sounds like discord may be a really great way to do that.
3992760	3997240	I think a lot of people are probably accomplishing that through Skype right now. I know we use Skype
3997240	4001400	video chat a lot for the game I'm playing right now. Uh, but that's cool that discord has that as
4001400	4006280	well. Uh, also picture and picture support is going to be available with that. And they're
4006280	4013400	saying that discord has 45 million users and counting. Uh, and I would assume a lot of the
4013400	4020840	boom for discord has come from, uh, in part, uh, Nintendo's lack of a robust online option,
4020840	4025480	causing people to look for alternatives and things like Pokemon go. I think discord has
4025480	4030680	been huge for Pokemon go has got a lot of people on that. Uh, and then like MMOs in general,
4030680	4034120	you know, I remember when you used to have to rent a team speak server,
4034120	4037800	but you don't have to do that anymore with discord. It's all kind of free. So I'm sure
4037800	4044520	MMOs and discord are huge and a big part of what's driving that as well. So, uh,
4044520	4050600	act deft and chat points out my two reasons for joining discord vog and splatoon team chat. Yes.
4050840	4056200	You can actually, uh, uh, do sometimes like when Flaco streaming, uh, I know I joined one of the
4056200	4059800	streams and he was in the vog channel on discord and you can actually join his game and talk to
4059800	4063320	him and interact with the stream, right. As it's going on. So I thought that was really cool.
4063320	4067480	So anyway, uh, yeah, discord is very cool. And I think it's great that they have video coming out
4067480	4071240	for that. Why would you need to do that? Cause then tinder has its own dedicated app. Isn't
4071240	4079320	that good enough? Uh, no, it's not good enough. That's my short answer. Dark Sakura. Well,
4079960	4083480	you know, I was saying earlier that I have cuphead and I really want to play it,
4083480	4088360	but of course the speed runners have already attacked the game with full force. Um,
4088360	4095720	and we now have a person who is 16 out of the top 20, um, cuphead speed runners,
4095720	4101720	except the speed runner named Goopy Legrand. Wait, not Goopy Legrand. Why did I say that?
4101720	4106920	That's one of the bosses. Oh no, I believed you. It was peeking boo. Sorry.
4107080	4112280	Because I knew it was a similarly ridiculous name. Are you sure that's not a boss name too?
4112280	4123160	But peeking boo beat the game with DDR pads, quite literally an arcade dance pad hooked up to a PC
4124040	4130040	and playing it with dance pads. And apparently this person has speed run other games this way,
4130600	4136520	but it was more or less, will the game stand up to the challenge? And yes, it did, uh,
4136520	4142680	beat the game in one hour, 24 minutes and 40 seconds. Um, the entire run is actually posted,
4142680	4147960	excuse me, posted online as well. Um, but there were, there were a few bosses that gave some
4147960	4154920	trouble, but for the most part, everyone and the final boss defeated with the dance pad.
4154920	4161640	That's impressive. That's impressive. So now, um, uh, his goal is to try to do it in under an hour.
4161720	4164440	Okay. You got any better? Julian, what'd you want to say about that? Um,
4165080	4168680	speaking of speed runs, there was someone who sped around the game,
4168680	4173800	dark souls with a guitar hero controller. This, this is a crazy thing people do. Do you,
4173800	4178920	do you like watching that stuff or do you think it's weird? I don't actually watch it. I just
4178920	4185560	look up top 10 videos on this, so I don't have to watch the whole two hour video. You just want to
4185560	4190040	see the summary. You just show me the bullet points is what you're saying. Yeah. That's what
4190040	4193400	I thought. That's what I thought. All right, Julian's going to be running his own company.
4193400	4199320	So we introduced the boy to rod caliber, but you play soul caliber with a fishing rod.
4201240	4205000	It's as dumb as it sounds. Julie and it really is. She always talks about it. It's pretty dumb.
4206680	4212120	I don't even know what that game is, but it's like street fighter, but if it's a video game,
4212840	4217720	you can't play with a fishing rod cause it's not a video game controller. That's what you think.
4217720	4226440	That's what you think on the dreamcast. They released a fishing rod controller for playing
4226440	4233640	get bass or as it was in the U S Sega bass fishing and that game is stupidly fun.
4233640	4241480	If I'm not mistaken, you could also play crazy taxi with the rod. You can play crazy taxi with
4241560	4244440	fishing rod. You can make some crazy money with a fishing rod.
4247320	4253240	Why did they make a fishing rod controller?
4259960	4261240	Rob has turned fuchsia again.
4261240	4273640	It's because back then, you know, they couldn't really improve games by, you know,
4273640	4276520	quality. So they added all these funny little controllers.
4276520	4282280	Julian, why they have the power glove. I have one. I think I have two.
4284280	4289240	We are going to school you in the dreamcast. You're going to sit down and you're going to
4289240	4295800	play sea man and you're going to talk to a fish. This sounds like Leonard Nimoy because it was
4295800	4301080	voiced by Leonard Nimoy. The nineties were a very interesting time, especially at the end.
4301080	4305400	What also killed me was Alan and you guys couldn't hear Alan shouting from the kitchen.
4305400	4312360	Hope that two weeks and no TV was worth it. I think Julian knows his audience.
4312360	4315000	He does. Yes. Julie's Julie knows audience. All right.
4315720	4319000	Okay. Let's move on.
4325480	4330520	So, uh, super Mario Odyssey, like most of the other Nintendo games that are on the switch
4330520	4335640	and other platforms, they of course have amiibo support. And one of the worries I always think
4335640	4339880	with some of these is that, Oh, look, here's another feature. It's basically locked behind
4339880	4346120	some garbage that I got to buy. So what's kind of neat though with this, I guess not neat, but
4346120	4354280	a fair use of it is it's not necessarily required, but you can do it. You can basically use it to
4354280	4359720	unlock outfits in the game, but you can also purchase those outfits in the game using the
4359720	4365800	in-game money within there that you earn not with real money. So, but if you want to unlock them
4365800	4371560	quicker than you can use the amiibos and do it that way. So at least it's not required. So it's
4371560	4378280	a neat bonus, but it's not required. Kind of like whole Skyrim thing. You don't need the Zelda amiibos
4378280	4382360	to unlock. You can to unlock it quicker, but you can also find that stuff in game.
4382360	4386120	Now you haven't always been the kindest when it comes to amiibo. So I bet this is,
4386120	4388840	this is a trend you're probably kind of liking. Aren't you low key?
4388840	4396520	Um, it's, I like that it's not required because that would just be dumb. Um,
4396520	4400200	but then at the same time, it's like, okay, then what's the real point then? I guess it's just
4400200	4405960	collecting them because they look neat. And then it sort of adds a feature to the game,
4405960	4410200	but not really because you can do it without it. So what's the point?
4411560	4416360	All right. Uh, moving on before I move on to the next story, uh, dark soccer, did you want to,
4416680	4419880	for the sake of our podcast listeners, did you want to repeat the disclaimer you're giving
4419880	4424200	in chat right now? We're writing language. Yes. So, uh, and this is actually kind of in
4424200	4429320	response to Brad, but before the email, damn it, Julian, I just spit water out of my nose
4429320	4433400	or threw in his best F bomb ever. And I said, his mom's laughing her ass off.
4433960	4438840	Becky's one of those people that realizes a word is a fucking word. Julian knows not to say that
4438840	4444440	Oh, at church. Like he wouldn't combust the moment he steps foot in one. Yeah. Don't, don't ever say
4444440	4451960	that at daycare. They're not going to like it there. All right. All right. Anyway. And active
4451960	4456760	says, uh, yeah, I was going to say that he knows what the word can mean and how it can be offensive.
4456760	4468120	There you go. Do we care? Oh, yes, please. I don't know why she handed me the mic.
4468760	4473000	Because you look like you're going to say something clever, but clearly not.
4473720	4477800	All right. Well, I got Julian and I just look ready all the time. All right. I got
4477800	4481320	to say he's just, he's just adaptable. Ready to go. All right. He is adaptable.
4481320	4485720	I got something that, uh, uh, may make you exclaim all sorts of words. Uh, this,
4485720	4491640	this sounds like it could be really cool though. Uh, Nintendo apparently has, uh, done a Game Boy
4491640	4497080	image trademark and, uh, you know, they want to trademark what a Game Boy looks like. They want
4497080	4505800	to do that for merchandising purposes, but, but there's also a trademark here for use as a
4506520	4514040	storage medium, as in you, they want to be able to put one of those out there and say,
4514680	4524360	have 30 of the best games preloaded already on it, including I'm sure. How is Tetris not going
4524360	4528920	to be? I don't know. Would they have the license? I need revenge of the gator. Yeah. Right. Well,
4528920	4533400	anyway, so I think we all see where this is going is going to be Tetris, Arkanoid,
4534120	4541080	Super Mario land. It wasn't Arkanoid. It was alleyway to the, the Egyptian Mario,
4541080	4548200	Mario land, that whole thing. Yeah. And, uh, the, the weird link game, the links awakening.
4548200	4552040	Oh, for sure. It'd be Game Boy color. I would imagine they would do the Game Boy color stuff.
4552040	4558520	Oh, Pokemon. Oh man, that, that alone is going to be hot cakes for that. So why don't they
4558520	4561800	would have like integration. That'd be kind of cool. Like with those older games, if they'd
4561800	4567560	have integration with like the, you know, with the Pokemon bank and all that. Yeah. Well, see,
4567560	4573000	the interesting thing is because now we're getting into stuff that is on virtual console because of
4573000	4580520	three D S right. So, um, meaning that like Pokemon yellow, you can download that and you can actually
4580520	4584600	play that on your three D S Oh, Julian is bringing me cake. You're the man. Thank you so
4584600	4592200	much, dude. All right. So, um, uh, you can, and you can, it actually does connect to the Pokemon bank.
4592200	4595960	So you can already do that with the three D S virtual console. I don't know if this would
4595960	4600760	necessarily be able to do that. It would be very cool if Nintendo did do that, but let's just say,
4600760	4607560	I'm not going to hold my breath. Yeah. I doubt it. Yeah. But, uh, yeah. So it seems like, uh,
4607560	4613880	instead of the N 64 classic, most people are assuming would be the next logical progression
4613880	4619240	from Nintendo to super Nintendo. You know, it seems like game boy is going to be the next
4619240	4625480	classic for next year. Probably. It's not, it's not a bad idea. It's really not a bad idea.
4627400	4634200	So, yeah. All right. Well, anyhow, uh, speaking of classics and speaking of systems,
4634760	4638520	I think it's time for the classic system of the month.
4640760	4645480	And you might be thinking, didn't we just do this last week? Well told people. Yes,
4645480	4651080	but it was a makeup session. So now we're getting to October's. Y'all need to listen. Well,
4651080	4656680	I just, sometimes I have to repeat things cause that's right. All right. Anyway,
4656680	4660200	so dark soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a system that she thinks, Hey,
4661080	4666360	this is something that you've neglected and probably with good reason in this case. Yeah,
4666360	4670520	definitely with good reason. Although I kind of want one just to have one because I've been
4670520	4675960	hearing about, well, not just that, but I've been hearing about people doing like different, uh,
4675960	4682360	mods to a minute of emulation on it. So, all right. It is the apple Pippin. Yep. And I'm
4682360	4687160	going to apologize to the live listeners because for some reason the audio here is left channel
4687160	4694280	only, which is weird. I didn't realize, but I, I could not find any with music. So, uh,
4694280	4697960	so I apologize for the live listeners. It's going to sound weird. The podcast because the podcast
4697960	4703880	is in mono. Uh, you're not going to notice this because the podcast for a size sake is not in the
4703880	4710760	greatest quality. So anyway, here is some of the background music from what Pippin game was this?
4711240	4716760	Oh, tropic Island. I think it's pinball game. Yeah. So anyway, um, the Pippin,
4716760	4722440	I kind of look at the Pippin is kind of as a precursor to the apple TV, to be honest. Um,
4722440	4730600	it was meant to be, um, a, uh, uh, audio visual stereo and television environment. Um,
4731400	4738120	it ran on the classic Mac OS architecture and it had, um, uh,
4738920	4745480	it actually was a licensed out to Bondi. Um, well the at Mark and at world models, um,
4745480	4750520	so that they could release them, um, in, uh, the Japanese and American markets as video game
4750520	4758840	systems. Um, and they also, um, was licensed out to caps media for the KMP 2000, um, that focused
4758840	4767800	on Europe and Canada. So the Pippin was named for the new, the new town Pippin, which is a type of
4768200	4773560	apple that is more tart than the Macintosh, which of course the Mac computer was named for.
4774600	4782360	So anyway, um, another neat thing about it though, is that Pippin was, um, used for, uh,
4783080	4789080	the, uh, a code name for the apple profile system that was out at the time for the apple three and
4789080	4795240	the apple Lisa. Can I just call out what an idiot I am live on air because I never realized that,
4795240	4801480	yeah, duh. All these things were named after apples. Yeah. I don't know why I never,
4801480	4805000	I guess I never really sat down to think about that before. Like where did the name
4805000	4811720	Macintosh come from? That's why my favorite apple to eat is an iPhone. Anyway, girl.
4813560	4819320	Um, but the intention, um, was never to release the Pippin on its own. It was meant to be, um,
4819320	4825720	open standard by licensing out, licensing out the technology, like how, um, JVC shared VHS,
4825720	4832680	you know. Um, so it was, it was neat for its time, but it really didn't, you know,
4833560	4839720	have, I'd say a whole much to offer. It was running on the, um, uh, well the original hardware,
4839720	4845880	I should say, was based off of the Mac classic two. So it was a 16 megahertz Motorola, uh,
4845880	4857240	68030 running, um, uh, you know, the Mac software. And it was, um, you know, it had,
4857240	4863320	you know, at the time it had a pretty standard logic board. The, you know, the casing was
4863320	4872840	designed by Bondi. So it really seemed to be a, um, you know, a good partnership. Um, but
4872840	4881160	the whole thing too is that this also was a system that could connect to the internet. Um,
4881160	4889480	it had a haze compatible modem, uh, built in. Um, and, you know, it's, yeah, one of the earliest
4889480	4895560	systems that had, um, internet connectivity built in. Um, and it was, uh, announced, um,
4895640	4906600	in Tokyo on December 13th, 1994, which I had graduated high school by then. Um, and then,
4906600	4913960	um, it also looked like in 1995, um, it was reported by Nikkei that Mitsubishi was going to
4913960	4921000	use the, um, the Pippin technology. And, but they never did actually sign an agreement. It
4921000	4928840	did manufacture, um, systems for Bondi and Cat's Media. Um, so it had a lot of crazy involvement
4928840	4940440	on it and, you know, there was also, um, uh, the death of the Pippin itself actually came about
4940440	4946920	when Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 97. So it's his fault. He pulled the plug on it. He was like,
4947000	4954360	no more. He stopped all of the Macintosh clones. So that included, included, um, the Apple Pippin,
4954360	4965400	uh, concept. So, um, and then, uh, uh, Cat's Media and Bondi continued to support the Pippin, um,
4965400	4971480	for a little bit longer, but, um, they had a hundred thousand units committed, but only sold
4971480	4979560	something like 40,000, 45,000. Uh, they sold that many? Um, and Bondi quit, uh, actually Bondi
4979560	4986680	continued to support it until December 31st, 2002. Um, but for games that came out on the Pippin,
4986680	4993000	um, it had some interesting licenses. Um, not too much came out in Japan, really. Um, and it came
4993000	4997480	out with like fewer than 80 games and applications. It was just like Microsoft anything in Japan,
4997480	5003000	basically. Yeah. In the US, there were 18 games that were stored separately and six CDs that came
5003000	5010040	with the Pippin. Um, had the, the browser was, uh, came out over CDs. So it was able to update to TV
5010040	5015480	works with the text and drawing app in it, but it can't, you could get anime designer, Dragon Ball Z,
5015480	5020360	which by the way, did get a PC release later. Um, at least an emulated one. You had the Compton's
5020360	5026280	Interactive Encyclopedia, Exotic Sushi. Well, that sounds like a boring game. Who wants to play the
5026280	5032280	encyclopedia? This was funny. It was movie. Okay. Mr. Potato Head Saves Veggie Valley. Okay. That
5032280	5038280	might be fun. Uh, The Journeyman Project, Pegasus Prime, Power Rangers, Zeo versus the Machine
5038280	5043880	Empire. Oh, don't tell Shane. Yeah. Right. Um, Super Marathon. Yeah. Shockwave Invasion Earth,
5043880	5050040	2019. Um, and, but what I thought was funny is that the controller was called the Apple Jack.
5050040	5057640	Oh, like the cereal. I reckon. Okay. Um, but for accessories, you could get either a wired or
5057640	5062200	wireless, um, Apple Jack controller. You get a keyboard and drawing tablet. You can get the
5062920	5070120	modems up to 33.6, uh, kilobytes, uh, kilobits a second. Sorry. You can bump the memory up to 16
5070120	5074200	megabytes. Wait a minute. Wait, what year was the Pippin? 94. And they were doing wireless
5074200	5078440	controllers in 94? Yeah. Okay. Now that's pretty, that part's pretty impressive because I don't
5078440	5081880	think a lot of systems really started like wireless didn't become standard until what
5081880	5089480	PlayStation two or three? It came with a floppy drive. It had an ammo 256, uh, 256 megabyte
5089480	5096600	optical disc. Um, the ADB adapter for connecting a Mac computer, Mac computer devices to a Pippin
5096600	5101640	and the Pippin to Macintosh ADB adapter for connecting the Pippin devices to Macintosh. So
5102600	5105960	it also can use, it used the old Apple color style writer,
5105960	5112680	2,400 and 2,500 printers through its serial port. So, and again, I look at this as being
5112680	5119000	the precursor to the Apple TV, really, because I have an Apple TV that I've been playing Sonic CD
5119000	5126760	on with a wireless controller. So had to start somewhere. All right. There it is your classic
5126760	5132840	system of the month, the Apple Pippin, which apparently 40,000 plus people had. And I didn't
5132840	5138840	know a one. So there you go. A little bit of a, a little bit of history there in our classic system
5138840	5143400	of the month. Actually, let me ask if you can hand the mic. I know first off, I got to compliment
5143400	5148520	Becky. Cause I was able to eat some of this pumpkin spice cake while, uh, while Jamie was
5148520	5152680	doing her segment there. And this is delicious. This is amazing. It's like carrot cake, but without
5152680	5159080	the lame carrots. Well, yeah, it's a pumpkin spice cake. I actually just found the recipe
5159080	5163240	on the internet a couple of weeks ago. Fantastic. All you people listening should be jealous right
5163240	5166920	now. That's awesome. Thank you so much, Becky. I really appreciate them. I want to ask Julian
5166920	5170680	real quick, our special guests tonight before, cause I know, I know y'all are, you have to do
5170680	5174040	a half show tonight, Jamie, and I'm assuming everybody else's is only here for half the show.
5174040	5178760	So I want to ask Julian before, before we kind of wrap up here, what do you think of classic games?
5178760	5182840	Do you like to, I know we joked earlier about, I don't ask if a movie is made in the eighties
5182840	5187000	or anything like that, but do you, do you go back and play old games just to kind of
5187960	5191720	see what they're like or do you, do you enjoy the old stuff or what?
5193400	5200520	Uh, sometimes I'm going to say this before, um, I answer your question. Sometimes I mix up
5201160	5204600	new games with old games like undertale. I thought it was made in the early two thousands
5204600	5210920	just because, or nine nineties. Yeah. Just because you made on purpose, horrible graphics.
5210920	5215640	Yeah. Like that's like, that's like what people do now. Like Minecraft was kind of like that too.
5215640	5222200	Yeah. But, um, I forgot what the question was. Oh, that's okay. I was going to say, do you,
5222200	5226120	do you like to go back and play old games? Do you like to learn about the old history or just,
5226120	5228920	you know, you just play them cause they're fun or do you not play mall?
5229880	5236120	I like to, but I usually don't at home. I usually play tons of old games when I, um, go to, um,
5236760	5243080	Jamie's house or something. Cause it was the one place I played the original NES Mario
5243800	5257080	video game. Yeah. Um, I also, um, played the third Mario game at, um, um, at school, um, after
5257080	5266280	school kids play video games at school now. Oh, excuse me. Excuse me. Um, I, um, on someone's
5266280	5273800	three D S it was horrible because I got to like the castle or something is like, Hey, guess what?
5273800	5280520	You lost all your lives. Start back at, start back at one dash one video games used to be really
5280520	5288120	cruel games. Didn't have a save and load option at all. No, it was very rare. It was very rare,
5288120	5292360	but I'm glad to anti Jamie is teaching you, right? And he plays pinball at my house. Oh yeah.
5292360	5297960	Pinball's fun. We got two new pinballs that you need to come play. You like pinball Julian?
5298600	5306280	Um, yes, but often extremely frustrating when you try to hit it, but then before you can,
5306280	5313000	it just dropped down. I know. I hate when it goes right down the middle and when you try to hit,
5313000	5317880	you can't hit it. Same kid. Same goes right down the middle. Feels same way. Some frustration.
5317880	5322760	We refer to that as a center drain. All right. Anyway, uh, dark soccer. I know you're going to
5322760	5325800	be leaving us here. I'm not going to be joining us for the second half of the show. Cause you
5325800	5331960	have some engagements early tomorrow morning. But did you want to quickly touch on some of your
5331960	5334920	rapid fire stories? I know we usually do those at the beginning of the next segment, but you
5334920	5338600	want to touch on your rapid fire stories here real quick? Well, Marvel got incredibly fussed
5338600	5343080	out for, um, saying they were going to do a presentation with a defense contractor,
5343080	5348520	Northrop Grumman, uh, Grumman. I'm saying that weird. Um, but then because of all the backlash,
5348520	5353560	they actually canceled it because they were accused of working with war profiteering. So
5354680	5362520	good that they canceled that. Um, and also in somewhat better news, Neo Geo battle Colosseum
5362920	5369880	is rumored to be in, uh, a development at SNK. So that would be nice. Is that something you'd
5369880	5376120	want to play? Maybe. So it's supposed to be all cell shaded, kind of like how, um,
5376120	5381720	Arc System Works does their thing. And of course we get all of our SNK characters that we like.
5382520	5385960	Did you see the funny typo though? They were saying that they were going to have, um,
5386760	5392280	uh, uh, Tekken at one of the things and they said it was goose Howard.
5393560	5399080	Oh, that was funny. Like a high auto correct. Yeah. It's funny when a auto correct ruins
5399080	5402760	everything. Right. Auto correct does ruin everything. All right. Well, we are going
5402760	5407160	to go to a break here and when we come back, it's just going to be Loki and I here left to, uh,
5407160	5410120	peruse the rest of the show and then take your calls here in the second half of our
5410120	5415080	show at orange lounge radio on Skype. Again, that's all one word, orange lounge radio on
5415080	5418440	Skype. Uh, but I do want to thank of course, dark soccer for being here and I'll let her have
5418440	5421960	her final thought in a minute there after she finishes her cake. Uh, but I do want to thank,
5421960	5426040	thank you Becky so much for bringing the cake tonight. And of course bringing the kid really
5426040	5430280	appreciate that. So, uh, you, you have yourself a fabulous time and we hope to have you guys.
5430280	5433480	You don't have to bring food to be on the show. Becky, you can come anytime you like.
5434440	5439400	All right. I'll bring food anyway. It's just my way. You're, you're the bomb. You're awesome.
5439400	5444760	Speaking of the bomb, Julian, the listeners love you. They think it's awesome that you
5444760	5447160	were on this show tonight. You got to come back sometime. All right.
5447800	5451880	Okay. All right. And also thank, thank you to the people that think I'm awesome,
5451880	5460200	even though I'm a 10 year old. It's it's Julian. It's okay to be an awesome 10 year old.
5460200	5464920	So stay awesome. It's also okay to be an awesome eight year old. Last time I was on the show,
5466440	5469880	but I still wasn't as awesome. I sucked back. All right. All right. Just don't,
5469880	5474280	just don't become total trash at 12. All right. All right. It's like I had this
5475000	5481400	awesome phase when I was eight, nine, 10, and then I was an ass and then like,
5482280	5487960	and I started becoming an asshole when I was 13. Yeah. Don't do that. Don't do that. Some kids go
5487960	5492200	to high school and they become total jerks. Don't be one of them. All right. Sounds good.
5492200	5495880	Treat, treat the other kids with respect. All right. I think the official word is try not to
5495880	5501240	suck. That's right. Try not. All right. Uh, we'll be back here in a little bit. Oh, I'm sorry. Oh,
5501320	5507080	sorry. Sorry. Of course. How very dare you. I was looking right at the rest of this cake
5507080	5510440	that has to be finished. Can you blame me that I'm well then I can do my final thought while
5510440	5513240	you eat your damn cake. That sounds good. Dark soccer. Your final thought.
5514680	5520200	Sit down in your chair and drink your God damn tea. Sorry. That was Sid. Um, my final thought is
5520200	5527160	because I did just come back from seeing gorillas and it was a fucking amazing show and Damon is
5527160	5532280	showing his age a bit, but it's still kind of hot. And, um, I got to see Dell, the funky
5532280	5539720	homo sapiens. That was pretty nuts. Um, but reject false icons. Fair enough. We're going to take a
5539720	5543720	quick break. You guys will be back. Don't, don't leave. The show's not over. We're going to take
5543720	5547880	a break. We'll be back to wrap it up with your phone calls and more news, including things like
5547880	5553080	a stranger things based video game. We'll talk about Fortnite battle Royale and of course your
5553080	5556920	emails. When we come back with more of orange lounge radio right after this,
5563560	5569720	welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio live tonight on the 8th of October, 2017
5569720	5576360	with episode 703 of our show already in progress. Oh, the studio feels a lot more empty now.
5576360	5582040	Yes. Just Loki and I left here, but, uh, Oh God, that kid is so funny. I was, uh, that's great.
5582040	5585880	You know what I like about kids, you know, even though I'm like, Oh, kids are probably not for
5585880	5589080	me. And maybe you would have a unique perspective on this. Cause I know you have two kids and I
5589080	5593400	don't, but I was always like, you know, one thing I can appreciate about kids. They're not going to
5593400	5596760	lie to you. They're going to, they're going to tell you, they're going to tell you the cold,
5596760	5600280	hard truth a lot of the times. And that's kind of what, that's what I felt coming from Julie
5600280	5605560	in there a little bit ago on games. So, yeah. So is that, are your, do your kids tell the truth too?
5605560	5610200	Usually they just like to talk about things. Okay. Now we're still trying to get your oldest
5610200	5614680	on the show at some point, right? Hopefully. Yeah. It's just tough with bedtimes and everything.
5614680	5617320	Yeah. We have to do it earlier in the day. Next time we do a noon show or something,
5617320	5621800	we'll have Mon. So awesome. All right. Well, usually, usually if there's a concert that
5621800	5624840	Jamie and I have to go to or drag queen, we have to go see on Sunday night. That's when
5624840	5629640	the noon shows happen. So we'll cross our fingers for that. All right.
5631560	5634360	To register participation for this week's episode of orange Andre,
5634440	5637720	created with vog network.com. Use the passphrase stage.
5639240	5643880	Uh, anyway, so, uh, before we get into some rapid fire news, Loki, I want to know your thoughts on
5643880	5649960	this because it's not directly related to games, but I think a lot of tech nerds are really feeling
5649960	5656280	it this week. And that's the fact that AOL instant messenger is going to be shutting down. That's
5656280	5662760	right on December 15th, AOL instant messenger is going to be gone. Uh, anything of AOL leftover
5662760	5668840	except the people still, I guess using the AOL email still has dial up available if you need it.
5668840	5673160	Well, I mean, I guess it would make sense that maybe like, and I'm talking like places like
5673160	5679560	Alaska, you know, like rural, rural Montana, like there's probably still places in the country where
5679560	5684760	they just don't have high speed internet, you know, that they probably barely have phone lines.
5684760	5690360	So I imagine that people still have to have some dial up, like very, very limited stuff. You know,
5690680	5694920	people out there aren't going to be playing video games on it, but they're using it to grab their
5694920	5700360	email and things like that, you know? So if you're lucky to grab your email, geez. Yeah. Yeah. I
5700360	5704760	guess it depends in this day and age, what kind of attachments you're getting on email. It might
5704760	5709160	take a while to download, but yeah, as far as I know, AOL still operates a full dial up service,
5709160	5714200	just like they used to. I mean, that's not their only thing. Uh, last time I checked in on him,
5714200	5719720	I think they were trying to make money from being like a triple a of tech. Does that make sense?
5719720	5723880	You know how like triple a your membership gets you discounts at all these different places.
5723880	5728920	I think AOL kind of tries to do that. Like they do like discounts on cell phone bills and all
5728920	5732360	from being a member. Yeah, it, I know it's not that appealing, but that's what you asked what
5732360	5737640	they're doing. If they're still around. I mean, that's what they're doing. Also, AOL was bought
5737640	5743640	at some point by, I think it was Verizon, if I'm not mistaken, which are oath that whole branch,
5743640	5748360	which if I'm not mistaken, just by Yahoo as well. So maybe something is going to happen where AOL
5748360	5754520	and Yahoo kind of come together. I'm not sure. Hmm. Yeah. So the people have abandoned,
5754520	5761320	but I don't, well, did you use AOL messenger a lot? Loki in the nineties? I used it a lot.
5761320	5764600	Well, it's funny earlier in the show, we were talking about the whole like online games and
5764600	5769560	how I'm playing one again. It's been a very long time, but I remember seven, eight years ago,
5769560	5775400	it was all on AOL instant messenger because Facebook messenger wasn't a thing yet. Yeah.
5775400	5780840	And text messages still cost money. Like, you know, which if you still have an archaic cell
5780840	5787400	phone, but I finally got off a cell phone plan last year that charged me like over 1000 text
5787400	5791160	messages. I had to pay like 10 cents because I don't, I don't get that many text messages,
5791160	5796840	especially when you have iMessage between iPhones is all free. Yeah. But I think all that stuff
5796840	5801400	has killed the need for AOL. Like, you know, I don't remember the last time I signed into AOL,
5801400	5809160	it's all Facebook messenger, Skype, um, text message, like all of that pretty much Snapchat,
5809160	5815480	even you ever use Snapchat? No. Yeah. I used Snapchat once. Did you? And that was it. Those
5815480	5820200	are fun. I didn't actually send anything. I just, I like looking at other people's stuff because
5820200	5824360	other people post stories and it'll be like, here's this concert I'm at, or here's this,
5824360	5828520	you know, show I'm looking at, or here's my drunk friend doing karaoke and, you know,
5828520	5833160	watching that kind of stuff. Cool. But you know, that's like the Snapchat interface is really
5833160	5840040	weird. Like, like, like an old ass man, Alan had to sit me down and be like, okay, so if you swipe
5840040	5844040	to the right, that's where you see everybody's stories. And it was like, I had to like,
5844040	5848600	right. And then I heard some stupid, I think it was Snapchat or maybe it was Tinder where like
5848600	5853160	the developers of it, they're like, well, we made it like that on purpose because old people can't
5853160	5856280	figure it out. And we're like, we don't want old people on earth. It was like,
5857640	5862040	fucking stupid. I mean like, and not that I would find something like that complicated,
5862040	5867560	but just that attitude is just fucking stupid. It is. It's Aegist. Tigerclaw on chat over at
5867560	5873560	live.vognetwork.com is saying ICQ is still around. Is it really? I just remember that little,
5873560	5878600	uh oh noise it made like every time you got a message is just, did everybody's make the
5878600	5886040	same noise on ICQ? Did you ever use ICQ? No, I'm almost positive. My number was something like,
5886040	5891720	it was only a few digits. It was one, two, nine, seven, two, two, six. It was a seven digit number,
5891720	5895560	which is pretty low. Don't bother sending in a message cause ain't nobody checking it. I don't
5895560	5899400	even remember the password. I might not be right on the number, but I don't have like a seven digit
5899400	5904920	number on ICQ, which I guess was considered really low. So that was cool, I guess, but I just
5904920	5910600	remember that little noise whenever you got the message. And then I've got like random messages
5910600	5914520	from people like in South America and stuff. It's like, I don't even know these people that
5914520	5919560	are just messaging me out of the blue. I guess maybe it was the earliest days of spam. I don't
5919560	5924280	know. But you think is, do you think ICQ is still big in some parts of the world? I guess I have no
5924280	5930200	idea. I don't know. All right. Uh, anyhow, let's move on. Let's do some rapid fire news back to
5930280	5937080	video games. All right. So there's, um, some teases coming from the producer of the Mega Man
5937080	5945320	legacy collection to Kazuhiro Tsuchiya. He's basically hinting that some announcement for
5945320	5951080	Mega Man's 30th anniversary is going to be made in December. I want to say that Capcom has not
5951080	5958040	forgotten about Rockman. Um, this here, the Mega Man 30th anniversary logo is being put to good
5958040	5963320	use. The Rockman 30th anniversary is coming to December, December. Please remember that date.
5963960	5967160	I don't remember. I remember something similar to this last week. I don't know if it was the
5967160	5970920	exact same thing. I remember Jamie mentioned something like this, but I remember, because
5970920	5977000	this is just in line with what I said last week, December is PlayStation experience. So if Capcom
5977000	5981880	is going to drop a bomb, like new Mega Man game coming, PlayStation experience certainly seems
5981880	5985960	like the place to do that, especially for December. Like what else? They said that the
5985960	5991400	original Mega Man was released in December 17th. So yeah, but video games, you know, way back then
5991400	5996440	video games, weren't quite like they are now where it's like a lot of the big stuff comes out at the
5996440	6001080	end of the year. Although I feel like we're getting back to that year round of releases,
6001080	6006600	because, you know, we've got a lot of big games that come out in January now, you know, uh, which
6006600	6012200	used to be like the deadest time of year, but there's a few things you get a few big, uh, and
6012280	6015960	then the street fighter five arcade thing. We were just talking about how to January release day,
6015960	6020760	but it's more of like it, I don't know. I think they released like early in the year to
6021800	6026200	a secret, that secret of mana remake that I guess is it's not on our show role, but it's actually
6026200	6030280	being shown at that New York comic con that's going on right now. Maybe, I don't know if Rama
6030280	6033960	was there, maybe one of our other New York folks, but I imagine somebody, somebody had to have gotten
6033960	6039240	their hands on it. I'm, I'm really curious to see, uh, how that secret of mana game looked. So I know
6039240	6043560	that, but that's out in like February, if I remember right. So, you know, early in the year
6043560	6050920	we're getting some big releases now. So, yep. So, um, there's, uh, the tying game that, well,
6050920	6055400	it's sort of like, I don't know, it almost seems like a fan game, but it, there's a stranger things
6055400	6062440	game that's on iOS and, um, the Google play store and it's free. So definitely worth checking out
6062440	6069320	because free, um, it looks like an SNES game, but I guess it's about revolving around the,
6070200	6076440	um, season one story. So, I mean, I don't know, it'd be worth checking out, but, um,
6076440	6082360	you have different characters with different abilities. Um, of course you can explore Hawkins
6082360	6087960	and the upside down and other things like that, but, uh, that'll tide you over maybe until the
6087960	6093560	second season, which comes out in October 27th. I hope you can run into Barb. That would be great.
6093560	6100200	Actually, I did download this, uh, onto my phone and I tried playing a little bit of it. And
6100200	6104840	it's a lot since, since, uh, it is like an old school game, but you do touch to move places
6104840	6110520	in the game. So, uh, the, the audio on this is so low. I wish I could turn this up so you can kind
6110520	6115720	of hear it, but it actually has like an eight bit version of the theme that actually plays.
6115720	6123160	It's probably not coming through very well, but kind of cool. So, Hey, it's free, free.
6123160	6127400	I just wish it was free on PC, you know, where you have actual keys and buttons.
6128040	6131800	Well, I had assumed the game is designed around tapping. Like it wasn't that you like
6131800	6135240	hold up or hold it. Like you tap on the screen where you want the character to move and the
6135240	6140040	character like a puzzle game or is it all action packed and stuff? Uh, I think there are action
6140040	6144520	elements, but it's a little more puzzle puzzle than it is action, but like there will be things
6144520	6148760	where you shoot things, but it's like tap to shoot and things like that. I think it's not
6148760	6152760	particularly complex, but I haven't played a lot of it. So don't quote me on any of that.
6153400	6157720	All right. Uh, some rapid fire news for me. Well, this is a little bit of a disappointment
6157720	6161960	because last week we were kind of hyping up the next Splatfest because in Europe,
6161960	6166360	they were going to get the, uh, toilet paper, which way should it go? Should it go over the
6166360	6172120	roller behind the rolls, which led to the whole discussion on back rolls. Uh, but, and, and we
6172120	6175800	thought, Oh, well, since the Europe Splatfest always matches the American Splatfest, or at
6175800	6181880	least it has the past few times, that's what we're going to get for sure. But Nope, we are not
6181880	6188440	getting the great toilet paper showdown of 2017. Instead, the theme for Splatfest here in America
6188440	6196200	will be team vampire versus team werewolf fucking Twilight was years ago. I'm like, we're,
6196200	6200360	uh, you just took the joke. I was going to be, we literally are getting the Twilight
6200360	6205880	showdown here. Jacob versus what's his name? Edward. Well, what the fuck was that guy's name?
6205880	6209080	Yeah, it's Edward. Okay. Edward versus Jacob. That's what we're getting,
6209080	6216040	uh, here in the States. So I guess, I mean, it's Halloween month, so I get it. It's, you know,
6216040	6219640	it's, it's, it's tying to Halloween, but I was still kind of looking forward to toilet
6219640	6225800	papering. Some of these houses, Halloween tradition too. That's true. So anyway, what do you, what do
6225800	6230920	you think team vampire or team werewolf? I think I'm leaning, you know, I, I understand that with
6230920	6234440	all the talk that we've had in previous weeks about Manthurn and things like that, that maybe
6234440	6240200	werewolf, but, uh, but team vampire is purple. Like that, that purple color of the paint is awesome.
6240200	6245720	So I think I might go team vampire blood red. You would think, right. But then what would the
6245720	6250360	wearable one be? Uh, the werewolf one is like brown, I guess like for something like that.
6250360	6256520	I don't know. So, well, there you go. So, uh, you can, uh, check that out. October 13th is when the
6256520	6262360	great vampire versus werewolf showdown begins. Uh, Oh, sorry. Act F it's orange, not brown.
6262360	6268040	Sorry about that. Orange. It looked brown on the photo. Uh, also this is a really awesome,
6268040	6272600	like gamers doing good news. I like to read things like this. Uh, there's a cool little
6272600	6278600	charity album that has just been released. It's called spirit, uh, which is a, uh, game music
6278600	6283800	charity, uh, album. And it's to benefit victims of hurricane Harvey. And I think that's awesome.
6283800	6288200	So you can actually check that out. It's available on iTunes, on Spotify, even,
6288200	6292760	and on band camp. There's only four tracks and they're kind of remixes from other games,
6292760	6296840	but still again, it's for a good cause. So it's worth checking out. It has a
6296840	6302920	hopes and dreams from undertale. Uh, it has main theme from final fantasy seven by Ruby tongue,
6302920	6308200	uh, apotheosis journey from the game journey, excuse me, uh, a remix by Steven,
6308200	6312920	Robert, uh, Frober. I hope I said that right. And then the ending theme to Pokemon Ruby and
6312920	6318280	Sapphire by Braxton Burks. So it's just four tracks, but still it's a great cause. So it's
6318280	6323240	definitely worth checking out. So if you have like an Apple music or a Spotify thing, go listen to
6323240	6327880	it. Cause at least, you know, they get some money that way. So check that out, but by the album,
6327880	6332040	if you want to do some good there, uh, for the greater Houston community foundation.
6332600	6336680	Awesome. Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates. So we'll start
6336680	6340520	in the U S with Loki and maybe he'll help me pick up the UK releases too.
6340520	6345080	So this week we do have a few things coming out. So we have a game called 88 heroes,
6345080	6351240	a 98 heroes edition on the Nintendo switch. Uh, we have a game called art. Oh, is it
6352200	6360280	Artika one that's on the Oculus rift, cyber dimension, Neptunia four goddesses online,
6360280	6365480	or I guess it's cyber dimension, Neptunia four goddesses online. So it's kind of weird,
6366280	6372200	middle earth shadow of war coming out on a PC PlayStation four and Xbox one. And then of course,
6372200	6378120	cyber dimension Neptunia that was on PlayStation four raid world war two on PlayStation four and
6378120	6388680	Xbox one tiny barbarian DX on the switch, uh, Toho or Toho Kabuto five burst battle on
6388680	6395720	the Nintendo switch PlayStation four and the Vita, uh, chaos child on PlayStation four and the Vita
6397320	6403560	and the evil within two looks like on PC PlayStation four and Xbox one.
6403560	6406440	That's out already. I mean, I knew that was coming out, but I thought,
6406440	6410920	I guess that makes sense. Scary games in October. It's that's when you do them. So, all right.
6410920	6415400	That's it. All right. We're getting to that end of the year rush. Uh, Japan also, uh,
6415400	6419160	seeing some releases this week, they are also getting their Japanese version of
6419160	6422920	middle earth shadow of war, which I imagine is kind of the big game here in the States this
6422920	6426520	week. And you know, probably, I don't think it's as big of a deal in Japan, but they are getting
6426520	6430840	a localized version over there from Warner. Uh, also coming out in Japan this week, lost
6430840	6435480	sphere, but that's spelled S P H E A R. They spelled it a little differently. Uh, and then
6435480	6442040	date a live Rio reincarnation HD. Yes. That is a game that is coming out in both a regular
6442040	6446600	and a limited edition. And it looks like another, uh, school girl manga type of game.
6446600	6451080	Uh, as we see get released there that doesn't usually get released over here. Uh, nothing on
6451080	6455000	the Vita for a change. I know we make Vita is dead jokes here in the U S all the time,
6455000	6459720	but Japan usually has some things to talk about, but it doesn't look like they actually do this
6459720	6467720	week. So I have to jump over to the Nintendo switch to find lost sphere is also out on the D
6467720	6473880	excuse me, the switch this week. Uh, and then lastly, over on the 3DS, uh, there is no new
6473880	6481800	games, but they have the new Nintendo 3DS XL, uh, is being released, uh, as that. Oh, I'm sorry.
6481800	6487000	I'm getting for some reason, a Europe thing snuck into my list there that is not being released
6487000	6491320	in Japan. My bad. I guess a little preview of what to look forward to in Europe. If Loki has
6491320	6496760	those dates ready. Yes. Um, so not a whole lot coming out. Um, we've got, of course,
6496760	6504200	a shadow of war coming out on PC PlayStation four and Xbox one. And then of course, uh,
6504200	6512520	it looks like the evil within two as well on PC and Xbox one story of seasons trio of towns on 3DS.
6513240	6519240	That's it. All right, let's go to the mail bag because every week you guys email us,
6519240	6524680	participate at orange lounge, radio.com. If you want to participate with the show,
6525320	6529320	and we do have a couple of emails to read for you tonight, so let's get to it again.
6529320	6535800	It's participate at orange lounge, radio.com. If you want to send us an email for a future week,
6535800	6539240	we're going to start off tonight. Jamie's not here, so I will take care of the emails.
6539240	6543880	We'll start off tonight with an email from kitten poker. I like that. Is that, is that
6543880	6547640	literally cats together, getting together, playing poker, and then writing us emails.
6548840	6553720	Anyway, kitten poker says, hello, just making sure you have something to read over that.
6554440	6558920	That's very calm. I guess after a couple of weeks of empty mailbags, it's very kind of kitten poker
6558920	6565080	to make sure that we have something to do tonight. Thank you. Uh, also not video games, but just
6565080	6572440	wondering if you've heard of critical role R O L E and if you have, what do you think of it? Um,
6572440	6577880	and thanks kitten poker. That's the email I've heard of it. I have not actually listened to it.
6577880	6582600	I'm in the same boat. That's the geeks and sundry getting together and playing D and D show, right?
6582600	6587560	Yeah. But that's if I'm going to watch a show like that, that's going to be kind of on the back
6587560	6593560	burner to myself watching Harmon's quest, which I still have. I set up my account for, uh, was it
6593560	6597400	Verve is what they call it now for season one. Cause I would want to watch that now that it's
6597400	6603080	free. I just haven't done it yet. So that would come first, but yes, definitely shows with people
6603080	6609640	that are funny playing, you know, D and D I am down with that. Yeah. Uh, yeah. I, I, I, I'm
6609640	6614600	familiar with the concept of the show. I must confess. I haven't listened to it. Um, I don't
6614600	6619000	get to listen to as many podcasts as you might think. Like I'm, I'm a huge advocate and supporter
6619000	6623000	that, you know, people who want to do one should be doing one, but I really only get to listen to
6623000	6628200	them on my commutes. So I'm kind of, I must confess and I hope this doesn't get back to
6628200	6633160	them because it will inflate his ego immensely. But one podcast I've been like not missing
6633160	6637080	recently is starboard power coupling here at VOG because I've actually been watching
6637080	6641640	star Trek discovery. So I've been like dying to know like what those guys think about it.
6641640	6646360	And it seems like it's, it's a very mixed panel over there. Like it seems like Dr. Ken's super
6646360	6649960	into it. Eddie's kind of, I don't know, this might be too dark. I don't know if I'm into it.
6649960	6654280	And then Matt's kind of trying to see both sides of it. So it's been some interesting.
6654280	6660600	Also watching was the new Seth MacFarlane one. Oh, the Orville Orville. Uh, no,
6660600	6666280	they're not talking about it there, but I know that is the general consensus in the nerd community
6666280	6671720	that the Orville is, if you like star Trek, you're probably going to like this. Cause it was like,
6671720	6675240	everyone thought it was going to be terrible. Even though I think the reviewers thought it
6675240	6679960	was kind of not that great, but then like it was really, it's apparently been pretty good.
6679960	6683160	I haven't watched it yet. The reviewers tore it apart, but people actually liked it. But
6683160	6687880	wasn't that the way the original star Trek was too? Like didn't reviewers not think it was great.
6687880	6692120	And then the fans really saved it. Like I, I almost thought that was how that story went there.
6692120	6697320	So I was trying to go to our chat room over at live.vog.network.com. Dungeon buster says
6697320	6702760	critical role is also on Twitch. It's basically live streaming tabletop gaming. Yeah. Um,
6702760	6707800	there was a show at dragon con where I met a couple of the hosts and they did a very similar
6707800	6712200	thing for the, and I I'm such an ass. I forgot the name of their show, but I know it's on giant
6712200	6716920	size team up is the name of the network. And they do, it was like, it was, it was like a one word
6716920	6720360	name with an exclamation point. It's one of that was, was the name of their show. I think,
6720360	6725400	I think it's a neat concept for a show truth be told, like if there were some indie folks that
6725400	6730120	wanted to do something like that for vog, like that's the type of show I'd love to recruit for
6730120	6734600	this network. I mean, you have to be dedicated to putting out regular additions and all that
6734600	6740120	good stuff, but I think those shows are a lot of fun. You know, actually a fun show free the stream
6740120	6745000	is, have you ever seen a tabletop was that they have like a tabletop, the game simulator or
6745000	6750440	tabletop simulator on steam where you set up your own games and yeah, I mean, granted, we just have
6750440	6755560	to make sure no one's going to flip the table because you can do that. But you know, I know,
6756200	6762440	somebody that is, uh, putting out a board game and somebody that's been working very hard on a board
6762440	6767640	game recently, and they've been using tabletop simulator to like test elements of the board
6767640	6771800	game without having to go and make all these pieces. If that makes sense. That's cool. Yeah.
6771800	6775960	I thought that was a really, it was really neat. Uh, when I, uh, heard about that, uh,
6775960	6781320	dark Tetsuya and chat says like a radio drama, uh, that too, I would say radio drama is a little
6781320	6785880	more in the Knight Vale camp, which there's, you know, a lot of shows, uh, very well. I mean,
6785880	6790440	that's a very different type of podcast, right? That's kind of like fiction versus nonfiction,
6790440	6793720	believe it or not. What we're doing here is nonfiction. It's real, right?
6794520	6799560	That fiction side of podcasting is a whole nother world that I must admit. I'm not
6799560	6805480	super familiar with, but again, I love the idea. And if there was somebody wanting to do a regular
6805480	6809480	type of thing, like, you know, that's, that would be a great fit here at the voice keys network,
6809480	6813400	I think. So, you know, if you know somebody that's producing a show like that, again,
6813400	6818440	the one thing we just want is regularity and we don't want to sign up a show.
6818440	6822920	That's going to disappear after five episodes. Cause we already had Poke stop podcast and we
6822920	6829160	don't want to do that again. So, all right. Anyway, uh, let's move on to the next email
6830120	6836520	last email tonight from our pal Y Y R. We always love to hear from Aaron or Y Y R. Hello,
6836600	6841560	LR. Enclosed are just a few of my thoughts on the show from last week.
6841560	6847080	First off, I'll answer the question as to why it's worth it to drop 80 beans on the SNES classic.
6847080	6852440	There are several reasons actually, but the biggest one is this. While I am all for choosing
6852440	6857960	not to spend money on this flawed impractical or poorly handled attempts to bank on nostalgia.
6857960	6863000	This is not one of those. After nickel and diming us by making us buy the same virtual
6863000	6868520	console releases over and over again, apparently, excuse me, to only then cut us off by shutting
6868520	6874120	down the storefront and preventing any future redownloading. Here, Nintendo is packing 21 of
6874120	6879080	this console's very best games into an adorable plug and play a hundred percent legal physical
6879080	6884200	package that can never be taken offline or revoked in any way. On top of this, you also get some
6884200	6890360	features that aren't part of either the original console or an ordinary, ordinary emulator,
6890360	6895800	such as the visually attractive, easy to use and built-in interface. Let's not forget that catchy
6895800	6899880	little tune that plays on the menu too. That's nowhere to be found in Super Nintendo. They made
6899880	6906040	it for that. And then the clever rewind feature. But arguably the best part is something that a
6906040	6913240	Raspberry Pi absolutely cannot offer. A pair of brand new, 100% authentic and original Super
6913240	6918440	Nintendo controllers with the only difference being the interface. This means that the games
6918440	6923880	not only look and sound the same as they did on the original hardware, they also feel the same.
6924920	6929800	Provided that Nintendo actually does follow through on delivering enough units to stores,
6929800	6936600	I will say this, the SNES Classic absolutely is nostalgia done right at a fantastic value. And for
6936600	6941160	paying proper tribute to this fantastic piece of history, I believe they should be rewarded with
6941160	6946200	your $80. Your opinion may differ, but that is mine. No, I think, well, I think a lot of people
6946200	6951320	would like to reward them with their $80 except, you know, they can't. They can't because they
6951320	6955960	didn't make enough and we're in the same scalper situation again. That's a whole nother issue
6955960	6960440	though, but I, I respect what YYR is saying about, you know, if you can get your hands on one,
6960440	6965320	here's why to buy one. Here's what, you know, instead of going to, well, I could do that on a
6965320	6970680	Raspberry Pi, here's a reason why people want it. And I do agree with the controller part. Yes,
6970680	6975960	I'm well aware they make USB controllers that are really fucking similar, but you know what?
6976040	6981800	They don't really feel the same. Like a lot of those controllers really feel cheap when you use
6981800	6987240	them. I'm pretty sure that they have USB adapters for the original SNES controllers, NES controllers,
6987240	6991320	like you can use the original controller. Yes, that they do. That's cool. So, I mean,
6991320	6999000	there is ways to get around that, but yes, it is a brand new controller. It's just really short
6999000	7003160	for some reason. They really, if they were smart, would have supported the Wii, you know,
7003160	7008280	be able to sync some Wii remotes to it. And then that way you could do it wirelessly since they're
7008280	7015160	just basically classic controllers anyways. Uh, Kaijuto in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says
7015160	7021320	SNES is 80 bucks. I thought it was 59.99. Surprise. The NES classic was 59.99, but yes,
7021320	7026440	the SNES classic is 79.99. It's okay. Cause they've changed absolutely fucking nothing.
7026440	7031720	Well, okay. Now to be fair, they do include two controllers. So that does kind of offset the cost
7031720	7039880	a bit with longer cords, slightly longer cords. Yeah. Not come barely, barely long enough to reach
7039880	7044920	the couch if I'm sitting in front of the couch, but not to actually reach the couch with me
7044920	7049800	sitting on it. Does that make sense? I don't understand why they can't make longer cords.
7049800	7056760	Is it a cost thing? Are they really just charge like $2 more? And then, I don't know. Anyway,
7056760	7061800	YYR continues. On a somewhat related note regarding the Wii shop shutdown. Now,
7061800	7066120	let it be said that I do not support piracy, especially considering that I create games
7066120	7071800	myself, but I'm sure you're already aware that the Wii console has already been hacked in every way
7071800	7077400	possible. Right, Loki? Uh, you may also know that using simple instructions is very easily to soft
7077400	7082520	mod your Wii and install things onto it. You may or may not, however, be aware that the entire
7082600	7087240	archive of Virtual Console and WiiWare is already available on the internet in large
7087240	7092120	archives and torrents. Now, I'm not going to suggest or endorse that anyone abuse this.
7092120	7096760	However, if something happens to your Wii console or its contents in the future,
7096760	7102280	it is very possible to get your previous purchase titles back. So when the Wii Shop channel goes
7102280	7108200	dark in 2019, none of its software will truly disappear for good. And that is a good thing,
7108200	7113800	because by the time you read this email, Xbox Live indie games will already be disappearing
7113800	7118440	forever. You know, it's funny. Yeah, there was, uh, I forget. It was someone from All Games. It
7118440	7122120	was Twitter, uh, tweeting on the All Games account. It was Derek. It was Derek. Yeah.
7122120	7126680	So Derek, I guess he had that, uh, you, you must die or you will die. He was like tweeting out
7126680	7132040	like codes and I was able to redeem one of them before they, before they shut it down. So Derek,
7132040	7136600	thank you. I don't know what the game is, but I've got it now. If I remember, I played it when
7136600	7140280	it first came out and it was, it was his little take on a bullet hell game, basically. That's
7140280	7144840	cool. I mean, yeah. I was like, Hey, free game. Cool. Yeah. Cause no, I mean, especially, you
7144840	7151320	know, for an indie game that I believe Derek did himself, uh, it was, it was good. It was a great
7151320	7157000	effort, you know, it's more than you've done. I'm just kidding. No, but no, it was, it was,
7157000	7161720	it was great. It was great. So, uh, yeah, it's, it is sad that all that stuff's gone forever, but
7162280	7168040	I know that Xbox one has now its version of this and we've talked a little bit about that before.
7168040	7175560	And I know YYR is looking at maybe, you know, doing some of his games for that. Uh, and maybe
7175560	7179480	Derek will too. I don't know. I don't know if he's done with that or whatever, whatever he wants to
7179480	7184440	do and all your favorite creators over on Xbox live indie games. So steam now, because there's
7184440	7188760	really no barrier of the entry except for a hundred bucks. I don't have a hundred bucks.
7189720	7193880	You get it back. If you sell a thousand dollars, nobody's going to buy my game.
7193880	7200600	Maybe. So maybe the three people that listen to OLR, but that's about it. All right. Uh,
7200600	7206360	dark Tetsuya in chat says I saw a stream that was playing off some Xbox live indie game stuff.
7206360	7212440	It was mostly terrible jank, but still as a send off, have you, uh, have you been able to play any
7212440	7216600	of the Xbox live indie game stuff? Loki? Like I know you said you redeemed the code, but I
7216600	7222600	have not tried because that involves me actually hooking up my Xbox 360 again. And so I have not
7222600	7228600	done that to do, you know, all of that. Yeah. That's my problem too, is that the Xbox 360 is
7228600	7233800	not hooked up. But, um, my understanding is, and I hope I'm not getting this wrong. Somebody in chat
7233800	7241800	can correct me if I am wrong, but my understanding is that, uh, you, uh, can still download for like
7241800	7247880	another year. You just can't buy anything else, right? Yeah. I think that's the case. All right.
7247880	7254680	Well, Xbox live indie games is done and, uh, we're going to have to send off Xbox live indie games.
7254680	7258600	The only way I know how.
7258600	7270760	That's right. Play off Xbox live indie games keyboard cat.
7276120	7279400	Thank you very much. All right. Rest in peace forever in our hearts.
7280200	7288440	All right. Thank you YYR for the email. Let's move on with some more stories and, uh, you can
7288440	7293160	always email us as well. Participate at orange songs, radio.com. Tell us a favorite Xbox live
7293160	7303240	indie game story. Loki. Okay. Um, so basically the, uh, switch is doing really well. It's making
7303240	7309000	Nintendo lots of money. Who would have thought it prints money, prints money. Yes. So the, um,
7309000	7315720	switch has actually caused and tender stocks to rise for a nine year high. Um, apparently they
7315800	7323720	are up 3.3% to a 43,930 yen. That's the highest they've been since September, 2008.
7324520	7331800	And apparently I still go on pretty strong. And along with that, of course, um, they're saying
7331800	7337640	that they're set to hit an annual annual, uh, shipment of switch consoles around the 20 million
7337640	7343240	mark. Um, along the, with that though, they're also saying that they're trying to increase
7343240	7348360	production. So they're going to be increasing the production by 2 million units per month
7348360	7355880	to hope to meet the demand through the holiday. So, um, neat. And then of course, along with
7355880	7359720	that, you know, they're also, is it still hard to get a switch easy? You know, it's,
7359720	7365720	it doesn't seem to be like I've seen them in stock in a few retail stores. They're not in stock
7365720	7371800	everywhere and all the time, but like I have gone into stores and seen a few systems sitting there.
7371800	7377880	So I don't think it's incredibly hard to get them, but they are out of stock in a lot of
7377880	7382280	places that would be good going into Christmas. There's a few on the shelf when, you know,
7382280	7386120	parents want to buy them for their kids. Like if I was to say, Julian's going to get his switch to
7386120	7389240	be able to play Zelda, if that's what he wants, I don't know. Like if I was going to, I'd probably
7389240	7396200	get that Mario's, uh, Odyssey bundle or something like that. Um, just, you know, they have Mario
7396200	7402680	Odyssey, but it's, I don't know. They're available. So, I mean, you can find them.
7402680	7406120	They're not like, I mean, there's still people trying to scalp them, which is like,
7406120	7411880	really late on that. It's kind of, they're out there. I mean, you're not going to need to sell
7411880	7415480	those guys thought they could wait until the holidays to make a bigger buck, but didn't work
7415480	7420520	out. All right. Well, I don't know if you've played any Fortnite battle royale. I've watched
7420520	7425240	a little bit of this on Twitch. Some of my buddies were playing on Twitch. I downloaded it with the
7425240	7429480	intention of playing with my friends, but I just, it hasn't happened yet. So I still haven't played
7429480	7433240	it. I just have the clients sitting there on my computer, but apparently this Fortnite battle
7433240	7439640	royale is doing pretty well, despite all the drama with, uh, pug B that we were talking about
7439640	7445240	the other week. Uh, or see, I know it's, I know it's pub G, but I like to say pug B is amazing
7445240	7451880	things, little pugs anyway. Uh, so anyway, unreal engine four is supposedly going to be getting some
7451880	7458680	tweaks to it to help support games like Fortnite battle royale, but it's not going to apply only
7458680	7465320	to Fortnite, which I think was part of the concerns that the developers of pug B had said
7465320	7470360	before is that, you know, that they were going to make improvements that only benefit that game. So
7470360	7476920	here is Epic games kind of doing something to the contrary, I suppose you could say. Uh, so anyhow,
7477320	7481720	dedicated servers will now support the larger number of players better, uh, with the change
7481720	7486760	log that they did. And, uh, some of the, I guess there's 60 Hertz servers, they get improvements
7486760	7493000	too. Uh, and so the level of detail system will allow for longer view distances, hopefully without
7493000	7497800	sacrificing performance, which is especially important on consoles where you have a more
7497800	7503960	limited memory than you usually do on the PC. All these changes are supposed to be in version 4.18
7503960	7510920	of unreal engine four coming out later this month, although some will not be out till version 4.19.
7510920	7515000	So that's pretty cool. Uh, although you might be wondering, well, when do I get to do this on
7515000	7520840	PlayStation four, at least doing the player unknown battlegrounds, the other, uh, game.
7520840	7526040	So if you do want to play yourself some pug B, uh, that is going to be coming out, hopefully on
7526040	7530280	PlayStation four, they haven't said anything official yet. Uh, the Xbox one version is later
7530280	7535640	this year, uh, and the game will be away from early access in 2018, getting its real release
7535640	7542920	on PC. Uh, but, uh, let's see the Xbox version will be launching later this year. And, uh, in a
7542920	7548520	statement from the blue holes, founder says that blue hole and Sony are thinking about a release
7548520	7554840	for the PlayStation four after that. So it may not be something exclusive to Microsoft's platform,
7554840	7559880	at least for very long. I would think though, this is the type of game, you know, I hope something
7560040	7564280	blue hole and the folks behind this game are thinking about. This is the type of game where
7564280	7570200	maybe they would have leverage to strong arm Sony and say, if you want us to put this game on your
7570200	7575000	console, you're going to let us do cross-play. And if Sony doesn't let them do it, they don't
7575000	7580200	release it. I, I kind of would like to see that cause you know, not every game can get away with
7580200	7585720	that, but I think this is one where they might be able to, to arm wrestle Sony a little bit on that.
7585720	7591240	I hope they do. I don't know what their problem is. I don't either. And that,
7591240	7595080	that attitude is going to shoot them in the foot at some point. It is. I mean, cause it's like,
7595080	7601320	not really right now, but like looking at like, if I knew what I knew now with the consoles and
7601320	7605480	I'm going back and I'm like, okay, am I getting a PlayStation four and Xbox one and how they've
7605480	7609960	treated like modding and they've treated, you know, online plan stuff. I probably would have
7609960	7616600	gotten an Xbox one because you know, they're seem to be more open to that stuff. And that's
7616600	7622120	important. Kaijuto and chat over at live.vognetwork.com says Sony won't do it. That
7622120	7625960	game is still kind of not complete. Well, it's supposed to be complete in early 2018. That's
7625960	7629560	what they're saying. It will be out of early access by then. So a few more months to make all
7629560	7635880	those tweaks. We'll see. Anyway, uh, on a different note, let's talk about Assassin's Creed Origins,
7635880	7639960	because that is coming out later this month. We've got another huge game this month, right?
7639960	7645160	Well, some of the early previews are hitting out there on the internet and something that has come
7645160	7650040	out of the previews. This is very important and should be a feature that is weighed in many video
7650040	7656520	games that is out there. It has come out that in Assassin's Creed origin, you can pet the cats.
7656520	7663080	That's right. Everybody video gaming in 2017, we made it fam. You can pet the cats in Assassin's
7663080	7669320	Creed origin, which of course many people are very, very excited about. I guess that is a
7669320	7676120	fan requested feature that actually made it into the game. The development lead Ashraf Ismail,
7676760	7682600	who is the game director of Black Flag, said that fans were thanking him personally for ensuring
7682600	7688760	that the much requested petting feature was added back into the game. So I guess in an earlier
7688760	7692920	Assassin's Creed game, you could pet the animals, but then it wasn't there for the last one. So
7693000	7697000	there you go. You will be able to pet cat. Yes, there's already YouTube
7697000	7702520	gameplay, petting cats and Assassin's Creed origins. That's it's important. Loki. It's
7702520	7706680	important. They don't have it in Grand Theft Auto. You can only shoot the cats or drive.
7706680	7715240	That's terrible. Run them over the car. Oh, rock star. Fuck you. You should be able to pet the cat.
7715240	7718840	You should be able to pet the cat. You love the cat. Love every cat. It's all I want to
7718840	7724920	do in video games. That's my personal dream game. Love every cat. That's all you do. You
7724920	7729960	go around a big open world like Grand Theft Auto, and your goal is to pet all the cats.
7731640	7737000	That's it. Isn't that a game you'd play, Loki? No, that sounds terrible.
7737000	7741080	Why? Because cats don't want to be pet sometimes. They chase after them.
7741720	7747720	Let me love you. Is it like a parkour game like Assassin's Creed where you're like scaling walls
7747720	7753320	and running along? You have to stealthily approach the cat, and if the cat sees you,
7753320	7756760	it has the exclamation point and then runs away. You know what? That'd be super easy.
7756760	7761160	You just get a laser pointer and you just, okay. That could be like a superpower
7762360	7767880	that you get in the game. Tiger Claw in chat says you have to remember it's the cat's world.
7767880	7772600	We just live in it. That's right. All right. A couple more stories for you guys before we open
7772600	7777160	up the sky. Why don't we have a set? Who is it? A cat's in Creed or something like that where the
7777160	7783560	cat is the actual assassin. Does the game have a pause button? That was a joke. I would have
7783560	7789640	expected the 10 year old to tell, but he's not here. Anyway, Loki saved me before we open up the
7789640	7796920	Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio. So the everybody's message service is going to be opened up,
7796920	7804120	I guess, to help close out Miiverse. So since Miiverse is shutting down in November,
7805400	7809320	that they're basically allowing, I guess, the open, the everybody's message community,
7810360	7816040	which is going to last, I guess, for a week. And the logic is you're all messages and stuff. I
7816040	7821160	don't know. What the hell is this shit? I don't, I didn't ever use this. It sounds like it's just
7821160	7827640	a community on Miiverse to memorialize Miiverse. So somebody needs to go paint
7827640	7830840	a picture of Keyboard Cat to appropriately send off Miiverse.
7833560	7838760	All right. I mean, yeah, it's Loki. I get the feeling you don't plan on participating with
7838760	7845320	this. I don't fucking use Miiverse. You know what? Speaking of games, which game do you think
7845400	7850040	my son is playing on the Wii U? He's been just super hardcore into
7850040	7855160	Captain Toad's treasure game. We don't have that. Oh, well shit. I don't know that. What
7855160	7860120	Mario 64? Really? Yes. Out of all the games that I have downloaded for him,
7860120	7865960	he was playing Mario 64 like crazy. I don't see the problem. I don't either. It's just like,
7865960	7869480	I was surprised because he didn't want to play into the margins. I downloaded them all the
7869480	7876920	Mario games like Mario, Super Mario one through Super Mario World, right? Zelda, you know,
7876920	7880840	and all that stuff. And he didn't play any of those. And then Mario 64, he just decided
7880840	7886280	to play and he's been playing. Was this before or after you saw the kiosk with Mario Odyssey?
7886840	7892120	Cause I could see where a kid might draw some similarities before he's done it before.
7892120	7896600	Interesting. Yeah. Okay. He only played Mario Odyssey because it's a game to play at the store.
7896920	7900600	Right. Right. Right. Okay. I thought maybe like he did that and then it was like, Oh,
7900600	7904200	this is the closest thing I have at home to Mario Odyssey. Like, I don't know. Sometimes
7904200	7908360	no, I just, I hear the music all the time. Like I hear, you heard it from the other room
7909960	7916840	where he's playing like all this stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Pretty much. So does he die a lot in the
7916840	7920280	game? I don't know. I've never actually watched him play. I can just hear him playing from the
7920280	7923800	other room. How does the wife feel about that? Oh, she doesn't care as long as she's not,
7923800	7928680	he's not bothering. Exactly. Well, here's something you could let the kids play, uh,
7928680	7934200	just in time for its 25th anniversary. That's right. Do you know what game series turned 25
7934200	7941880	this week? Mortal combat. That's right. Mortal combat with a K turned 25 years old this week.
7941880	7945960	And, uh, yeah, they actually put out a little video that was on Twitter that was kind of
7945960	7951240	floating around, uh, about the mortal combat, uh, franchise and the legacy there, uh, the different
7951240	7957960	games in the series. The original game was 1992, 25 years ago, mortal combat arcade followed by
7957960	7964680	mortal combat two, three, ultimate mortal combat three, mortal combat trilogy, mortal combat four.
7964680	7969800	That mythology's game was sub-zero mortal combat gold, which was a dreamcast game,
7970360	7975320	mortal combat special forces. Then there was deadly Alliance tournament edition,
7975320	7982520	which was game boy advance deception Shaolin monks Armageddon was, that was the one with, uh,
7982520	7986440	like every fucking mortal combat character ever was Armageddon. Right. Because I think that was
7986440	7992360	the big send off of that. Uh, unchained was the PSP version. Ultimate mortal combat was the Nintendo
7992360	7998120	DS version. Then they had mortal combat versus DC universe, which was the brutality game. Right.
7998120	8002840	And then, uh, there was mortal combat 2001. I don't know which one that was. Oh, that was the
8002840	8007320	reboot, right? It was just called moral combat. It was called moral combat. And then a mortal
8007320	8011320	combat arcade collection, complete edition. Those were just, you know, greatest hits.
8011320	8018440	And then mortal combat X and XL. And, uh, that's where things stand. The last release was XL in
8018440	8025800	2016, which was really, you know, it was just a re re-box of X from 2015. So, you know, next year
8025800	8034600	will mark a, uh, three year gap between two. So, um, this year wasn't this year, the DC one. So
8035400	8041160	I would imagine the out of next year. Oh, injustice. Yeah. This year. Yeah. I would say
8041160	8044200	next year would be a good time for moral combat. Well, I don't know. There was mortal. It's actually
8044200	8049400	2011, not 2001. I don't know the years printed wrong here, but, uh, 2011 and 2015, that was a
8049400	8055560	four year difference. So I would say maybe 2019 to be the latest, but they might tease it before
8055560	8061480	that though. They also had, well, they had injustice one too. So that's true. I don't know.
8061480	8065240	Well, we'll see. Would you be excited for a new mortal combat game? I don't play them. So I don't
8066040	8069560	they, they're getting a little, they're getting a little violent for me. It's a little much like the
8069560	8075880	moral combat X was pretty intense. Gameplay is good. I mean, they keep upping the fatalities,
8075880	8081560	but it's just like kinda after a while. It's just, it's not that impressive. We're going to
8081560	8086440	open up the Skype line right now at orange lounge radio, all one word on Skype. If you want to do
8086440	8090360	it the old fashioned way, one eight seven seven game. O L R I would like to see them. Cause you
8090360	8094440	know how they deal with like the horror characters in there. I would like to see a horror character
8094440	8099000	licensed fighting game. Why not just do an all out like smash brothers, but all horror characters,
8099000	8104360	Jason, Freddy, Jason, Ash predator, Ailey. I mean, most of these people are already in
8104360	8108200	leather face are already like side characters that they've added in all the games. You know,
8108200	8111880	we'll just do that. Yeah. The game. What's your earliest memory while we wait for some calls,
8111880	8116760	orange laundry on Skype. What's your earliest memory of a mortal combat moral combat one?
8116760	8121560	I mean, yeah. I remember going to the nickel arcade to play it where you had to pay the
8121560	8125960	two 50 to get in and then you play the games on the nickels. Yeah. I want to do a few of those.
8126520	8130360	There's fun. I wonder if we used to play in a nickel arcades. Geez. I don't even remember
8130360	8136680	anymore. It wasn't DDR cause that was before DDR. Um, that was the big one that there was
8136680	8141000	another like violent fighting games were all the rage around that year. Cause moral combat
8141000	8145000	kind of pushed the envelope. There was that one. Was it time killers was the one where you chopped
8145000	8149320	off the arms and legs and then eventually you could chop off the heads like that. And those
8149320	8153960	were literally the attack buttons you had like leg leg, hand, hand, maybe it was gauntlet or gauntlet
8153960	8159880	legacy or legends or whatever that we were playing. Yeah. Or you know what it was? It was a lot of
8159880	8166680	those like Capcom brawler games, you know, like the Simpsons arcade Ninja turtles. Oh sure.
8166680	8171800	That type of stuff. Konami. Yeah. Yeah. Well, Konami didn't do those turtles. Yeah. Oh yeah.
8171800	8176920	That was true. Yeah. That's right. Simpsons was on the same engine. Yeah. Yeah. Um, I'm thinking,
8176920	8184120	yeah. Captain commando and um, X-Men the X-Men arcade game. Yeah. Yeah. All of those. Cause those
8184120	8190120	final fight didn't play a whole lot of final fight. Really? Yeah. Just, um, I played captain
8190120	8195000	commando was like my favorite game. So I played that a ton. We had that. It was funny. Cause like
8195000	8199080	when I was growing up, we had like an arcade game. Like they were, there's one of the seven 11
8199080	8203560	there's one at this other diner. There's one where the pizza place that was nearby had different
8203560	8206760	games. So if we wanted to go to different places to play different games, like yes,
8206760	8214600	refire two at the seven 11 and Kevin commando at this cafe and um, your Rico's pizza had like,
8214600	8218440	you know, a few different games, um, none of which were that great, super off road.
8218440	8226040	I remember they have that. Um, I don't know. I remember when mortal combat two first came out,
8226040	8230520	how fricking crazy everybody went. And like, I remember going to this little like quickie
8230520	8234120	Mart store. It wasn't actually seven 11, but something like it that actually had a mortal
8234120	8237800	combat two machine and like all the kids in the neighborhood were there because it was like the
8237800	8241880	graphics were insane. And I just remember seeing that for the first time when it was like one of
8241880	8248360	the fighters punched the other into the acid and that one stage it was nuts. So yeah, I think the
8248360	8252280	computer did it to him or something. Cause I don't, I don't know if people knew how to do
8252280	8256360	it right away. You know, you used to have to trade, you get them out of magazines or trade
8256360	8261160	them on BBSs to figure out how to do fatalities, fatalities and everything. And they used to have
8261160	8266440	guides or something. Exactly books. One last shout out for calls, uh, orange lounge radio,
8266440	8271160	all one word on Skype. Have you played any of the newer mortal combat? No, I still do. The only
8271160	8276920	thing I have that's recent is in the first injustice because that was one of the PlayStation
8276920	8282920	plus plus. Yeah. And so I still have to go back and play that. But no, I, I never really got into
8282920	8288920	moral combat as more street fighter. That's okay. I understand. Uh, I did, I played a little bit of
8288920	8293960	the mortal combat 2011 one cause I liked that it was kind of a re-imagining of the classic games
8293960	8297480	and that the story actually kind of went through the first three games. And you know,
8297480	8301560	I know the, the piece with my mother and her seeing that for the first time was, was pretty
8301560	8305960	legendary here on this show. But uh, yeah, you know, I, I, I, I enjoyed playing through that
8305960	8308760	game and then Alan got really into that game for a little bit too. He was playing it a lot.
8308760	8313320	He played through the story. So I mean, I'll give mortal combat that it usually had a pretty good
8313320	8317080	story and I liked how they have like in a lot of the like PlayStation two and later games,
8317080	8321960	they have like the crypt, which had like 11 billion unlocks in it. Right. Like all the
8321960	8326920	different colors and art and music and like everything. So I always was pretty impressed
8326920	8332680	with that go cart game and yeah. Uh, dungeon buster in our chat over at live.vog network.com
8332680	8337960	says Genesis with the blood code. Oh, remember how Epic that was when the blood code came out
8337960	8342840	for the Genesis that you could actually enable the blood cause the super ninja I had the super
8343800	8349640	version for you can change with the game G. You could change the color, but you could not
8350200	8355880	suddenly change sub zeros fatality back like that, that those sprites with the severed heads
8355880	8360760	and stuff, they were just not in the cartridge. Right. So you could not re-enable the original
8360760	8366280	fatalities. It just was not in the programming at all. So unfortunately the newer fatalities are
8366280	8371240	always really lame. Like didn't Johnny cages just become like an uppercut and that was like
8371240	8378120	the fatality. I don't even remember. Like, uh, sub-zero froze the guy and then it shattered
8378120	8382840	into ice cubes, which I guess that was, that was, that's still kind of violent, but you have to kind
8382840	8387400	of infer a lot of the violence, but for some reason they left Sonia's the same Sonia and
8387400	8392680	scorpion. They never changed because there's wasn't blood. It was fire and setting somebody
8392680	8400440	on fire was fine. This is weird Nintendo logic in the nineties where as long as you don't see blood,
8400440	8405160	it's fine. But if somebody is, you know, vaporized, then you don't see blood. So it's fine.
8405960	8411240	So, and then they changed. What else did they change? They changed like, uh, uh, what was the
8411240	8417080	other really violent one in that game was like, Oh, like Kano used to rip out the heart. Right.
8417080	8422040	So instead it just looked like Kano did a tummy tickle and they died because there would be no
8422040	8431000	heart twister titty twister. All right. Well, sadly the phones aren't lighting up. I guess,
8431000	8435720	uh, people feel that they cannot follow Julian tonight, which I don't, uh, I don't blame them.
8435720	8440200	He's a pretty, he's a pretty hard act to follow. And also, uh, I think rage nators not here
8440200	8444360	tonight. I hope he's okay. He usually calls in right away, but I don't even see him in chat
8444360	8450760	tonight. He left earlier. Yeah. So, all right. Well, anyhow, uh, that's going to do it for
8450760	8454920	another episode of orange lounge radio tonight. Thank you guys so much for listening to our show
8454920	8459160	this week. We really appreciate it. Uh, but I think, uh, I think that's going to do it. We'll
8459160	8463320	be back here in seven days. Do it all again. As we get closer to Halloween, we can talk a little
8463320	8469640	more about scary games. Maybe we'll stream some more or something like that. Uh, but for now,
8469640	8473000	we're going to leave you with, uh, this message. If you enjoyed what you heard here at orange
8473000	8476840	lounge radio tonight, tell a friend or two about the show. Help us spread the word because we are
8476840	8482360	the show where every gamer has a voice, but only if those voices are out there to be heard.
8482360	8486440	See now is when you need to like stream all the anymore scary games for PlayStation VR. Well,
8486440	8493000	I guess they have Russia bloods. All right. I mean, but like, um, I don't need to play scary
8493000	8497560	games. The blood is awesome. That is like my favorite PlayStation VR game. Although I have,
8497560	8502600	I still have to go and I just don't want to set it up. I just, I just, I still need to go and play,
8502600	8507400	um, super hot cause I have super hot VR. Okay. I got to make a point this week to play super hot
8507400	8512120	VR. That game was the, I liked watching a Bobby and his friends play that game cause they had that
8512120	8517800	at dragon con. Bobby set that all up and that looks awesome. But I know there's more VR games
8517800	8523640	coming soon. I have to kind of check in there and see what they have available now. Um, but yeah,
8523640	8529080	we need more scary games on there. Like I know that they have, um, on Oculus survivor or something
8529080	8535080	like that. It was the, uh, like a room which I figured it was like a chair in a room or
8535080	8538360	something like that. I figured it's called something simple like that where you're sitting
8538360	8544760	on a chair and creepy shit happens and Oh yeah. It was like resident evil seven. No, not that one.
8545400	8548360	No, it's like literally called like a room with a chair or something like that. I don't remember
8548360	8553640	what it's called. Well anyway, speaking of dragon Congress, I mentioned that a minute ago. Y'all
8554280	8558920	make plans for dragon con next year. It's going to be awesome because it's not just like
8559800	8565400	by black off, we'll be there. But guess what? Travis Donovan's coming back next year. I knew
8565400	8570440	he wouldn't stay gone forever and I'm so happy that he'll be back. Uh, next year he's making
8570440	8575880	his plans to do that. So that's really exciting. So dragon con 2018 make it happen. Oh, there is
8575880	8582040	another game I saw. Um, you should actually pick up on, it's um, done by my, one of my favorite,
8582920	8589960	um, favorite developers, uh, that does like cluster truck and all that stuff. Um,
8590680	8595720	but they did a new stick fighting game. So it's like two stick figures and you're fighting,
8596520	8599560	but it's like the levels keep getting crazier and crazier as you go along.
8600120	8604360	And it's like five bucks on steam right now. I think it's like stick wars or something like that.
8604360	8609800	But, um, definitely check it out. It's by landfall games. Okay. And I watched, uh,
8609800	8614200	watched the stream of that and it looked hilarious. It would be totally a game that
8614200	8620200	I think you guys would dig. All right. Thanks. I'm a wishlist. Well, let's get final thoughts
8620200	8623720	and then we're going to call it a night here at, uh, the voice geeks network. Loki,
8623720	8627160	your final thought tonight. Yeah. Sick fight. The game was the name of that. Um,
8627160	8632520	my final thought is sorry. Haven't been working on programming because unfortunately I am knee
8632520	8639160	deep in fucking Lego addiction. So, um, I don't know what to do. And I gotta, I gotta go through
8639160	8644920	this phase and then we'll, we'll see how that happens. It's not going to get better though.
8645560	8649640	It's going to get worse before it gets better. And then my final thought is, sorry, I haven't
8649640	8653960	been streaming cause of psychological online game addiction. So, but I'm going to do a stream
8653960	8657720	tonight. So stay tuned for that. I'll tell you more about that after the credits here,
8657720	8661160	but for everybody, uh, thanks for listening. We'll be back to do it in seven days.
