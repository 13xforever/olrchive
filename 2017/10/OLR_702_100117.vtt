00:45.880 --> 00:51.760
Roberts joined right over here in Studio N7 in lovely Sacramento California by my

00:51.760 --> 00:56.120

01:08.320 --> 01:12.920
to move moving is punishment for stealing in some countries it is think

01:12.920 --> 01:17.560
about it oh yeah I just I'm thinking about the future you know run episode

01:17.560 --> 01:24.080
900 yeah or episode 1000 I'm also feeling a little a little feisty because

01:24.080 --> 01:27.320
I was listening to Lewis Black on the way to the show just just just because

01:27.320 --> 01:31.480
of that like not just because like does encourage the best parts of me not just

01:31.480 --> 01:37.680
because it's your normal nature like how you always are she says she eats her

01:37.680 --> 01:40.440
what is that a bagel or something over there you can try a piece it's Hokkaido

01:40.440 --> 01:46.640
cream pun I what you know that's a title cream bread okay it's really good

01:46.640 --> 01:51.200
season I like pound cake oh it's not actually it's made with milk hmm little

01:51.200 --> 01:54.760
pound cake isn't it good yeah it's pretty good I like that you know what

01:54.760 --> 01:58.960
you don't look like a mini Alaska Rob food tasting live on OLR well that's

01:58.960 --> 02:02.440
that's the perfect thing that goes with video games is food so it's just natural

02:02.440 --> 02:08.280
that we're gonna bring it up anyway the tech master of all things food Loki he's

02:08.280 --> 02:12.280

02:12.280 --> 02:16.000
one of the kids got him sick so he had to bow out of tonight you don't have

02:16.000 --> 02:21.480
kids stop it his kids are precious little angels except when they aren't

02:21.480 --> 02:26.480

04:03.200 --> 04:06.360
and talk about our weeks and all that good stuff let's kick it off let's kick

04:06.360 --> 04:09.560
off tonight's show talking about the Super Nintendo classic which is kind of

04:09.560 --> 04:13.360
what's dominating the gaming news cycle this week because I know a lot of folks

04:13.360 --> 04:18.320
were very much anticipating this and I think the big question out there was was

04:18.320 --> 04:22.800
Nintendo going to fuck this up on second thought I think I do have some of these

04:22.800 --> 04:27.480
other games so dark Sakura dark soccer now we talked a little bit about this at

04:27.480 --> 04:31.680
the tail end of Bobby Black Wolf tonight but you you're for now anyway passing on

04:31.680 --> 04:36.160
this Super Nintendo classic just because you and anybody who's listening to olr

04:36.160 --> 04:39.840
for a while kind of knows you and the hubby collect video games obsessively at

04:39.840 --> 04:44.200
least the old stuff especially well we did and now we kind of don't need to

04:44.200 --> 04:47.480
collect anything anymore well meaning that okay so when I say that like the

04:47.480 --> 04:50.560
retro stuff obsessively so you stopped at a certain point so maybe your

04:50.560 --> 04:54.440
collection when it comes to PlayStation 3 isn't as impressive but you stopped

04:54.440 --> 04:59.320
collecting like 10 years ago no was out no every game that they ever made except

04:59.320 --> 05:02.640
for we haven't really actively sought out anything unless if something was a

05:02.640 --> 05:08.240
super good deal yeah you know or you know it was well holy hell we're at a

05:08.240 --> 05:11.640
thrift store and someone is selling a Super Nintendo with Pocky and fucking

05:11.640 --> 05:17.080
rocky too do you know how much that game is by itself yeah it's crazy like 300

05:17.080 --> 05:21.560
bucks yeah unboxed yeah and we got one for 50 bucks with a pile of other games

05:21.560 --> 05:24.800
and another fucking Super Nintendo because somebody didn't know what it was

05:24.800 --> 05:31.560
worth hello goodwill thank you yeah so but because okay but you built up this

05:31.560 --> 05:36.240
collection then essentially accident in the 90s in the early 2000s mostly in

05:36.240 --> 05:42.000
the early on yeah so and it doesn't all go bad they're all cartridges well they

05:42.000 --> 05:45.640
haven't rotted they yellow but they haven't rotten they have some disc rod

05:45.640 --> 05:49.600
on some laser discs but our cartridges are eternal so so you don't really have

05:49.600 --> 05:53.840
a need for this not really enough played Star Fox to have played the the fan

05:53.840 --> 06:00.280
excuse me hiccup fan translation hmm and it's fun it's okay I don't think I'd pay

06:00.360 --> 06:04.440
80 bucks just for Star Fox too that's just one of those little like it's just

06:04.440 --> 06:09.920
a little like it's a little cute little cute little dot on the cupcake it's one

06:09.920 --> 06:16.480
of those little cinnamon hots okay oh but I'm looking over the lip I don't

06:16.480 --> 06:23.480
like fake cinnamon I'm looking over the list and I mean I'm really trying not to

06:23.480 --> 06:29.440
do the toot my own horn thing hmm but I truly believe like the only game on here

06:29.440 --> 06:34.240
that I'm not sure if I own other than of course Star Fox 2 because it no one

06:34.240 --> 06:41.480
owns a legit cartridge copy of it hello right um is I think we don't have Kirby

06:41.480 --> 06:46.080
superstar I think I do have Kirby's Dream Course that's funny because I have

06:46.080 --> 06:50.360
Kirby's Dream Course and my collection is nothing I think I have Kirby's Dream

06:50.360 --> 06:54.160
Course I think I don't have superstar which is a travesty I'm pretty sure we

06:54.160 --> 06:59.360
have Contra 3 somewhere so so all this SNES classic made you do is realize shit

06:59.360 --> 07:05.440
we need to find a copy of Kirby superstar pretty much I mean okay but

07:05.440 --> 07:08.240
let me let me ask you there's only one game on here I really don't care about

07:08.240 --> 07:11.280
let me ask you this and if you don't want to toot your own horn take yourself

07:11.280 --> 07:14.080
out of your shoes for a minute put yourself in my shoes now I played the

07:14.080 --> 07:17.600
Super Nintendo I love the Super Nintendo but I didn't build up the collection you

07:17.600 --> 07:20.760
did I kind of took a break from gaming in the early 2000s because that's when I

07:20.760 --> 07:24.080
was in college and I just I didn't really rediscover my love game to extra

07:24.080 --> 07:28.280
in college I know but I didn't really rediscover my love for gaming until you

07:28.280 --> 07:30.920
know I took a few year break and then like DDR kind of brought me back right

07:30.920 --> 07:35.400
and here we are you know all these years later but you know if if I don't have

07:35.400 --> 07:39.400
all those games but I have memories of playing these games in my friends houses

07:39.400 --> 07:42.640
do you see where this is more appealing to me I totally do yeah I know and keep

07:42.640 --> 07:47.880
in mind if I didn't have at least half of the games on here yeah hell yeah I'd

07:47.880 --> 07:53.780
be all kinds of hot for one okay and we do we've asked our our buddy you know

07:53.780 --> 07:58.100
hey you get another one in let us know yeah you know it'd be great to have but

07:58.100 --> 08:05.300
our nest classic is it's still sealed we have not opened it it is on a shelf

08:05.300 --> 08:10.500
on top of I want to say a stack of Genesis games and that's hilarious you

08:10.500 --> 08:13.220
know some people who still can't get one that now they're gonna hate you for that

08:13.220 --> 08:18.420
comment but no it's it's it's it also well you have to also look at the

08:18.420 --> 08:22.260
perspective it is a collectible item and sometimes you don't open collectibles you

08:22.260 --> 08:26.420
like you know there's some people don't open their amiibos that's stupid well

08:26.420 --> 08:30.020
my amiibos are actually no all my amiibos except for my Animal Crossing

08:30.020 --> 08:33.340
ones because I got all the Animal Crossing ones right right and I got all

08:33.340 --> 08:38.140
the the Kirby Planet Robobot ones but I was gonna say if I was in your shoes and

08:38.140 --> 08:42.620
I had the big impressive collection then I probably would pass on this you're

08:42.620 --> 08:45.660
right there wouldn't really be like what is there to drop 80 bucks on the only

08:45.660 --> 08:50.820
thing I could remotely think of is well a the cute I mean it is it's adorable

08:50.820 --> 08:53.360
the little thing is adorable the little Super Nintendo even though doesn't like

08:53.360 --> 08:56.020
the eject button doesn't really work but it's cute but the only thing I can think

08:56.020 --> 08:59.820
of is that like the the fact that it's HDMI native and doesn't have to be run

08:59.820 --> 09:03.740
through converters yeah that's cool I mean that's what we were talking about

09:03.740 --> 09:08.640
making it worthwhile for yeah because we can't play it on our 4k TV without

09:08.640 --> 09:14.380
there being significant lag a twist and see that was what we ran ran into when

09:14.380 --> 09:21.040
we did the NES marathon for I think Dan was doing it for Child's Play just you

09:21.040 --> 09:25.260
know games all day and I was trying to play the Guardian Legend and I was like

09:25.260 --> 09:30.820
fuck I don't remember my my what's the word I'm thinking my reaction time being

09:30.820 --> 09:35.100
this slow and it turns out there's like a one to two second delay using the

09:35.100 --> 09:41.620
converter and that just makes games like that practically unplayable you know but

09:41.620 --> 09:45.860
I mean if we did another one probably run it through though you know we we

09:45.860 --> 09:50.500
picked up a Vega for like 10 bucks at a thrift store an age ago mm-hmm and I'm

09:50.500 --> 09:56.540
sure well your ex-roommate had a Vega right oh the one I try to forget yes

09:56.540 --> 10:01.540
well sorry no it was the house for a while yeah I know I know money Melrose

10:01.540 --> 10:09.420
place yes yeah um but that was it's been great because it's really high def for

10:09.420 --> 10:14.620
what it is and we've been able to play on it so I mean it's just like do I want

10:14.620 --> 10:19.420
to sit on the couch and play or do I just want to go in the game room and sit

10:19.420 --> 10:24.300
on one of those chairs that Dan you know ripped out of old Honda Prelude to

10:24.300 --> 10:28.140
make his driving rig out of back in the day still the driving rig by the way but

10:28.140 --> 10:32.500
we still have the prelude seats on boxes let me get to some of the comments from

10:32.500 --> 10:35.820
our chat over at live dog vog network comm vid power feeling good about the

10:35.820 --> 10:39.380
SNES classic saying my friend and I played the SNES classic all day

10:39.380 --> 10:45.460
yesterday yummy miss nostalgia all day fuck consoles in our chat no tell me how

10:45.460 --> 10:52.140
you really feel says NES mini plus SNES mini equals $160 raspberry pi does both

10:52.140 --> 10:56.140
and is $35 and can do both get a man who can do both

10:56.140 --> 11:00.660
okay no man I think that's right I am an independent person who doesn't need a

11:00.660 --> 11:04.980
man but anyway look all that joking aside like and I I just I have to

11:04.980 --> 11:07.060
address this because it was a really funny article it was going around

11:07.060 --> 11:11.980
Twitter and Facebook this week I mean the whole like um you too can get a

11:11.980 --> 11:16.300
Raspberry Pi and never shut the fuck up about it and all that stuff like I I get

11:16.300 --> 11:20.580
that perspective of using the emulator it's a valid perspective if I couldn't

11:20.580 --> 11:24.460
get my hands on an SNES mini and I've said this on the show many times I would

11:24.460 --> 11:27.860
have been left with no other choice than to steal it and it would that would have

11:27.860 --> 11:32.380
been doing the Raspberry Pi option because I mean sugarcoat it all you want

11:32.380 --> 11:37.020
unless you own all those games you're putting on your ROMs you are or I see

11:37.020 --> 11:41.740
me putting on your Raspberry Pi you are engaging in I mean it's it's very it's

11:41.740 --> 11:46.540
very gray area and it's you know but but it is it's piracy I mean let's just

11:46.540 --> 11:50.140
put the word on it it's piracy but I would have done it too you're copying

11:50.140 --> 11:54.820
that floppy right but I would have done it too if I couldn't pick up one of

11:54.820 --> 11:59.140
these things but if Nintendo did not want me to have one but I will say this

11:59.140 --> 12:04.260
there's a few things to be said about the fact that it is official the fact

12:04.260 --> 12:07.860
that it is a cute little collectible that the little you know device itself

12:07.860 --> 12:13.260
is is great and it is an official Nintendo product and so forth like I all

12:13.260 --> 12:18.100
those things are you know appealing to me in a way just as a longtime gaming

12:18.100 --> 12:23.700
fan I want the stuff that's you know available by Nintendo now will I have to

12:23.700 --> 12:27.660
use a Raspberry Pi to play the stuff that I know Nintendo is never gonna put

12:27.660 --> 12:32.100
out on any type of like like let's say I want to play Pocky and Rocky 2 like that

12:32.100 --> 12:35.940
game is just never coming back that's why it's so you know so if I want to

12:35.940 --> 12:38.420
play that I'm gonna have to use Raspberry Pi I don't have another

12:38.420 --> 12:43.460
choice but you know for these games that you know were and I gotta say it's a

12:43.460 --> 12:46.780
pretty impressive list of games I told Dark Soccer I wanted to do a thing here

12:46.780 --> 12:48.820
at the top of the show where I said okay I want you to take three of those games

12:48.820 --> 12:51.820
and strike them and tell me what three games you'd put on it and Jimmy's like I

12:51.820 --> 12:55.400
can't do it no there's one on there I would get rid of well okay one which one

12:55.400 --> 12:59.580
it would be Contra 3 Contra 3 because it's not really the greatest Contra

12:59.580 --> 13:04.500
game right I would probably put say content to three on it okay well that's

13:04.500 --> 13:10.740
well or that's chance but Kirby's Avalanche okay three Kirby games Jamie

13:10.740 --> 13:17.420
three Kirby games fuck yeah why why not just a Kirby classic you know I wonder

13:17.420 --> 13:21.380
I wonder if this is where you know I haven't even got to the news store I

13:21.380 --> 13:24.340
want to read but I wonder if this is where Nintendo might go with this next

13:24.340 --> 13:30.100
like I know everybody's expecting an n64 classic but I'm gonna throw a

13:30.100 --> 13:37.220
different option out there maybe for 2018 Nintendo might look at doing a

13:37.220 --> 13:42.260
Mario classic and what it's gonna be it'll be like a little Mario head or

13:42.260 --> 13:45.780
some really cute little Mario collectible Kirby but and what will be

13:45.780 --> 13:50.060
built into it is gonna be like let's say some of the things are you know what you

13:50.060 --> 13:54.020
know what that SNES classic is missing that's a really big void in it Super

13:54.020 --> 13:57.020
Mario Brothers all-stars it's completely missing from that now all

13:57.020 --> 14:00.860
those games are in the NES classic but anyway they could do a Mario classic

14:00.860 --> 14:04.660
that has those Mario World Yoshi's Island yes I know all these things

14:04.660 --> 14:08.740
already exist but maybe they throw in a couple other the Mario side story stuff

14:08.740 --> 14:12.180
and then how about where's Mario everyone's favorite Mario is missing

14:12.180 --> 14:18.220
Mario is missing yeah whatever I do but then do Mario 64 is also going to be in

14:18.220 --> 14:21.660
it and I bet that would be thing and then they could do a Zelda classic that

14:21.660 --> 14:26.140
would have all the Zelda games and Ogrina of Time and maybe Majora's Mask

14:26.140 --> 14:30.900
as well that may be a direction Nintendo goes in that would be my prediction if I

14:30.900 --> 14:35.020
was at Nintendo and I was like what you know do we want to do an n64 classic I

14:35.020 --> 14:41.140
just an n64 classic would probably not have as many games on it I know it

14:41.140 --> 14:44.780
sounds really shady but if they if they can't get the third-party licensing to

14:44.780 --> 14:47.780
have shit like Goldeneye on it which I don't think they would be like I don't

14:47.780 --> 14:50.460
think they can get Goldeneye on it you know and some of the other stuff I don't

14:50.740 --> 14:56.820
I don't know if it's gonna be as must have lost the license for the likenesses

14:56.820 --> 15:01.220
in Goldeneye actually I think they've lost the licenses for the name mm-hmm I

15:01.220 --> 15:05.340
know there was a bunch of a bunch of stuff that went around oh why oh it's

15:05.340 --> 15:14.020
had some problems getting re-released but crap there was another I think that

15:14.020 --> 15:19.180
they'd have some trouble doing some of the n64 games unless well no they

15:19.500 --> 15:21.980
wouldn't because they'd probably have enough memory built in for instead of

15:21.980 --> 15:28.660
the expansion port but I don't see them going the route of doing an n64 classic

15:28.660 --> 15:33.420
but we'll see I feel like Nintendo is gonna why ride this wave another year

15:33.420 --> 15:37.140
one way or another so we'll see really they're riding on the coattails of Atari

15:37.140 --> 15:41.940
mm-hmm you know with the Atari flashback mm-hmm it's it's stuff that's already

15:41.940 --> 15:47.020
been done it's just finally they're like oh there's call for it let's do it all

15:47.020 --> 15:51.940
right well so to talk a little bit more specifically about what's going on in

15:51.940 --> 15:56.540
the news and the blogs about the SNES classic this week it sounds like overall

15:56.540 --> 16:01.700
the experience is going better for people and granted everybody's issue is

16:01.700 --> 16:05.060
different because like even I notice in chat over at live dog network calm we

16:05.060 --> 16:08.860
have everyone got a mini but me man which I think is break man so I think

16:08.860 --> 16:12.220
there are some people that are still frustrated I do hear Amazon made a big

16:12.220 --> 16:16.340
screw-up that messed some people over so I think some people are still salty

16:16.340 --> 16:20.900
about that and I acknowledge that I get that but it sounds like the big picture

16:20.900 --> 16:25.500
is a lot less people are salty this time there were salty about the NES classic

16:25.500 --> 16:30.140
and I think those that are salty now if if they want to still I mean some people

16:30.140 --> 16:33.060
may just say you know what fuck fuck this whole thing and bow out and that's

16:33.060 --> 16:36.300
fine but those that want to stick with it I think probably will end up with an

16:36.300 --> 16:41.620
SNES classic you know sooner rather than later so I kind of feel like the vibe

16:41.620 --> 16:45.420
out there is genuinely you know positive us gamer kind of did a little

16:45.420 --> 16:49.980
compilation compiling of all these different stories kind of looking at

16:49.980 --> 16:52.700
different boards and things like that and people overall were pretty much

16:52.700 --> 16:56.900
saying you know it was it was way better basically this time things things were

16:56.900 --> 17:01.900
doing better this time you know the lines were there but you know it was

17:01.900 --> 17:05.340
kind of manageable most people were able to get one if they showed up even you

17:05.340 --> 17:08.940
know an hour beforehand or what have you you didn't have to camp out all night

17:08.940 --> 17:12.060
although of course many people did especially at places like the official

17:12.060 --> 17:19.740
Nintendo store and some of that stuff so anyhow also I'm noticing in chat

17:19.740 --> 17:22.540
they're talking about how Mario is missing is really not that great of a

17:22.540 --> 17:26.460
game it's not it's edutainment it's for small children yeah I know it was it's

17:26.460 --> 17:30.540
uh it's the Donkey Kong jr. math of the Super Nintendo era it's like it's

17:30.540 --> 17:33.900
trying to be where in the world is Carmen Sandiego with Mario but that's

17:33.900 --> 17:38.220
actually a really good analogy and but but Carmen Sandiego you could type and

17:38.220 --> 17:41.780
you can't really do that on super yeah that's what makes it but you see what I

17:41.780 --> 17:47.100
mean though yeah it's meant to be secret you know education ooh do you want to

17:47.100 --> 17:49.260
talk a little bit here I know we've addressed it but you want to talk a

17:49.260 --> 17:52.700
little bit here about the Star Fox thing at the top of the list there oh yeah

17:52.700 --> 18:00.780
Star Fox um so the the ROMs already been dumped you knew how is this I mean I'm

18:00.780 --> 18:04.620
saying this tongue-in-cheek obviously it is news it made all the wires up there

18:04.620 --> 18:07.860
but I'm saying it tongue-in-cheek how is this news because hackers are gonna hack

18:07.900 --> 18:12.540
we all know that right it's it's we knew it was gonna happen right away how

18:12.540 --> 18:17.460
quickly did they get the the nest mini figured out oh before it was on shelves

18:17.460 --> 18:20.900
just like this pretty much thing somebody took one of those things home

18:20.900 --> 18:24.500
early that was in a store somewhere that had a connection and dumped it before

18:24.500 --> 18:30.260
the thing was even out well and also they got it extracted to a dev cart mm-hmm

18:30.340 --> 18:38.020
and they had an RGB modded SNES hooked up and also the dev cart they has is

18:38.020 --> 18:45.540
super FX to dev cart and got it running on a Super Nintendo so it works there's

18:45.540 --> 18:50.820
a video of it and everything so I am completely not surprised and you know

18:50.820 --> 18:54.220
the one thing I'm waiting for is to see now how much capacity for you know more

18:54.220 --> 19:00.460
games does it have on it how how how much longer until they figure out how to

19:00.460 --> 19:04.300
get more games loaded on it or create like a ROM loader or something like that

19:04.300 --> 19:08.660
so only a matter of time probably not too long I hear a lot of the technology

19:08.660 --> 19:13.020
in there is very similar to what already exists on the NES mini so I'm sure that

19:13.020 --> 19:15.620
I think they think they've already had some there's like a whole reddit

19:15.620 --> 19:18.420
dedicated to the hacking the Super Nintendo classic and I think they've

19:18.420 --> 19:22.500
already had some type of like limited success with it so probably I would say

19:22.500 --> 19:27.180
I don't know if I would go in and hack mine today but I'll give it a month or

19:27.180 --> 19:31.460
two for everything to kind of iron out and then we'll see I'm kind of torn on

19:31.460 --> 19:37.220
the issue because you know a do I really need to do that be do I want to you know

19:37.220 --> 19:41.660
quote unquote taint the collectible I guess for lack of better term by doing

19:41.660 --> 19:45.500
that to it so I don't know I'm gonna kind of just give it a couple months and

19:45.500 --> 19:50.000
see what I want to do but no and I I'll share the video with everyone in the

19:50.000 --> 19:54.280
chat room because it's just neat the guys shows the cartridge he has and

19:54.280 --> 19:59.080
everything and then loads up the game and it works on a Super Nintendo so hey

19:59.080 --> 20:03.080
Tiger claw and chat over at live dog network comm says sky but first try to

20:03.080 --> 20:06.920
beat every single game on the SNES mini before you do that you know it's funny

20:06.920 --> 20:12.620
I have good luck with Contra I've beaten a lot of them prior but yeah I mean I

20:12.620 --> 20:15.220
think it would be fun it would be if I'm sure I'm not the only one I'm sure I'm

20:15.220 --> 20:17.800
by far not the only one thinking this there's probably hundreds of people

20:17.960 --> 20:21.440
doing this but I thought it would be a fun little like streaming thing to

20:21.440 --> 20:25.600
actually stream beating you know all the games on there at least the ones that I

20:25.600 --> 20:29.480
can do you're right I don't know if I can do Contra 3 but I'll try I can try

20:29.480 --> 20:33.360
but some of those games are gonna take a while like you know don't forget guys

20:33.360 --> 20:38.560
things like Final Fantasy 3 6 I know but 3 in this case Final Fantasy 3 and Secret

20:38.560 --> 20:42.120
of Mana those games are hours and hours and hours those games are still long

20:42.120 --> 20:46.600
games just because they're retro did not suddenly make them faster you know

20:46.600 --> 20:49.680
unless you unless you're speedrunning them but I'm not a speedrunner that's

20:49.680 --> 20:52.480
not what I would do with them I would play them as if I was playing them for

20:52.480 --> 20:55.880
the first time I'm gonna have to check the date on this one because there's a

20:55.880 --> 21:01.200
I mean I know that beta 64 is done one on star yeah this is the old one I was

21:01.200 --> 21:05.720
hoping that beta 64 would do an updated video of Star Fox 2 you know now that we

21:05.720 --> 21:11.560
have a release of it but I don't know because I liked watching the old the old

21:11.560 --> 21:16.120
video all right I also learned something new yeah that the Super

21:16.120 --> 21:21.600
Nintendo in Australia looks like the Super Famicom oh does it that's the one

21:21.600 --> 21:26.260
the one in Europe looks like that too doesn't it yeah yeah same yeah I didn't

21:26.260 --> 21:29.720
know it until I didn't even realize it until I saw my friends I would I think

21:29.720 --> 21:32.200
those are cute and I wouldn't mind getting one of those but I think it's

21:32.200 --> 21:36.400
it's the exact same game lineup I think yeah I think so I think the one in Japan

21:36.400 --> 21:41.400
is different just like the NES classic had some different titles in it like

21:41.440 --> 21:46.720
for example I know let's see I'm actually pulling it up I know Legend of

21:46.720 --> 21:51.840
the Mystical Ninja was on the go him on going on you know and that that is on

21:51.840 --> 21:54.840
the Japanese one I'm actually trying to pull up to see what the changes were

21:54.840 --> 22:02.960
that they made okay so for our version Japan does not have earthbound Kirby's

22:02.960 --> 22:09.520
Dream Course Street Fighter 2 turbo Super Castlevania 4 and Super Punch-Out

22:09.520 --> 22:13.600
those are unique for us Japan does not have those but Japan has these five

22:13.600 --> 22:18.040
instead going on they have Super Street Fighter 2 the new challengers that's

22:18.040 --> 22:21.520
weird we got Street Fighter 2 turbo they got Super Street Fighter 2 that's kind

22:21.520 --> 22:27.000
of weird but that's how it worked Japan also got super soccer paneled upon and

22:27.000 --> 22:32.880
fire emblem mystery of the emblem those are pretty yeah epic though for I'm

22:32.880 --> 22:38.360
really surprised not get mother too and we have that I guess I don't know that

22:38.360 --> 22:41.440
it was as big of a deal yeah I guess though as far as RPGs go you're right it

22:41.440 --> 22:44.520
probably was that fire m1 was just like the way bigger deal whereas you know

22:44.520 --> 22:48.440
earthbound was pretty big here even though the Nintendo still continues to

22:48.440 --> 22:55.160
rob us of Earth Mother 3 earthbound to everyone call it so anyway all right hey

22:55.160 --> 22:58.320
we talked about games that aren't just Super Nintendo we do play other games

22:58.320 --> 23:01.840
too so let's before we get into the rest of this week's gaming news let's talk

23:01.840 --> 23:04.880
about how is your gaming week and the types of video games that you've been

23:04.880 --> 23:08.200
playing this week so dark soccer oh did you get to play some games well actually

23:08.200 --> 23:13.560
really the past two weeks you were here yeah um I well it's like I I mentioned

23:13.560 --> 23:18.440
before I bought clubhead haven't had a chance to start it yet but I'm really

23:18.440 --> 23:21.120
looking forward to that because that's the game I've been waiting for for a

23:21.120 --> 23:30.800
while um I I quit Wow a couple of weeks ago what else did I play I'm still

23:30.800 --> 23:38.160
playing idle pouring on my phone because it's actually ridiculously fun and how

23:38.160 --> 23:43.760
it's like all of the parts of an MMO without actually having to play it if

23:43.760 --> 23:47.120
that makes sense I mean you play it but you don't have to do the running around

23:47.120 --> 23:54.440
annoying part and you know your quests are kind of different so I'm also I'm

23:54.440 --> 23:58.840
still kind of playing me Tomo and Pokemon go I participated in a raid all

23:58.840 --> 24:02.440
by myself and it was my first raid ever and it was the one around the corner

24:02.440 --> 24:07.920
from Rob's house that I did on the way here did you it was it like a magic

24:07.920 --> 24:12.480
carp or something no it was a bay leaf okay so like one of the one stars that

24:12.480 --> 24:16.560
you can do by yourself and I caught him to good job with whatever that white

24:16.560 --> 24:21.760
ball is premier ball you know whatever it's white white balls at least it's not

24:21.760 --> 24:30.280
wrinkly your milky white balls yes okay um I also I got danganronpa v3 and I

24:30.280 --> 24:37.280
started it but I think I'm going to stream all the parts of it that I do so

24:37.280 --> 24:44.640
I will be playing it a lot more slowly than I wanted to but and I was thinking

24:44.640 --> 24:48.160
because I was I started it on a Wednesday because I started with the

24:48.160 --> 24:51.480
demo which I still need to finish the demo I'm not gonna do the demo trial I'm

24:51.480 --> 24:56.680
just gonna play it on my own but I'm gonna start with v3 I was supposed to do

24:56.680 --> 25:00.640
it on Wednesdays but I'm going to see gorillas on Wednesday oh shut up where

25:00.640 --> 25:06.640
at San Francisco oh it's gonna be fun cuz my friend Crystal got an extra

25:06.640 --> 25:13.000
ticket oh and I couldn't the same crystal I know yeah yes same crystal I

25:13.000 --> 25:19.440
know right yeah uh-huh um got got an extra ticket and so I was like hell yeah

25:19.440 --> 25:25.400
I want to go so we're like we're going like heck yeah awesome so I wanted to

25:25.400 --> 25:31.360
see gorillas for like 12 fucking years so it's happening boo yeah so and they

25:31.360 --> 25:34.600
do it just for people that are like isn't that a cartoon man they yes they

25:34.600 --> 25:38.680
do like the hologram they do the um to pocket Coachella thing right they know

25:38.680 --> 25:42.760
how they're doing it for this one oh really the one that they did last year

25:42.760 --> 25:47.120
was like they used to have like the big screen and everyone playing behind the

25:47.120 --> 25:51.000
screen Hatsune Miku it's like a Hatsune Miku if they do it if they do it hollow

25:51.000 --> 25:55.800
like that and then I get to see Damon Auburn in person I'm like oh so I'll be

25:55.800 --> 26:03.360
happy because I was also a big blur fan in the 90s but not to digress too much

26:03.360 --> 26:12.400
from the game thing I we got a pinball we got a pinball mm-hmm we got a

26:12.400 --> 26:17.720
medieval madness congrats dates the re-release it's got like the color LCD

26:17.720 --> 26:23.520
screen and all that and what the digital screen and it's got like the black trim

26:23.520 --> 26:29.280
on it it's I think one of the tournament editions but I kind of beat Dan on the

26:29.280 --> 26:34.760
game today like I don't beat Dan at pinball like ever and I beat him by like

26:34.760 --> 26:42.080
a million points today it was pretty fun and we're having to fix Star Trek so but

26:42.080 --> 26:47.160
yeah we have a medieval madness in our living room now fun the collection grows

26:47.160 --> 26:56.000
I'd like to go to Disneyland but Dan keeps buying pinball tables I'm just

26:56.000 --> 27:00.880
giving him a hard time I super I super love pinball and I really you know if

27:00.880 --> 27:06.920
they redid theater of magic oh heck yeah mm-hmm I I have like three or four the

27:06.920 --> 27:11.880
table is so fucking good sorry I want theater magic of the four that are on my

27:11.880 --> 27:17.400
list huh it would be theater magic huh it would be bright of pinbot 2.0 it's

27:17.400 --> 27:20.320
the one that's got the conversion in it that has like the extra modes and

27:20.320 --> 27:27.400
everything mm-hmm black rose the one with a cannon and everything and I'd

27:27.400 --> 27:32.920
really like a Big Bang bar but those are even the repros are expensive so I think

27:32.920 --> 27:36.440
you know I don't collect pinball machines yet wink but I think my dream

27:36.440 --> 27:41.840
list would be baby Pac-Man baby Pac-Man pinbot the original I used to have one

27:41.840 --> 27:46.880
and the theater magic I think that's on almost everybody's list magic is

27:46.880 --> 27:51.600
expensive now it's a great table though and probably ten grand for one magic is

27:51.600 --> 27:56.040
Scheherazade I think or what was the genius share what does that one the that

27:56.040 --> 27:59.840
went with a big lamp in the middle that spins I'll look it up I think it was

27:59.840 --> 28:04.400
though like magic of Scheherazade yeah something like that so that's and that

28:04.400 --> 28:09.400
that one I really like to Oh maybe Adams family Adams family is good but it is

28:09.400 --> 28:13.440
pricey it is well it's so like I know I'm naming a bunch of cliche tables but

28:13.440 --> 28:17.320
these are like these are my memories from you know many years ago and well

28:17.320 --> 28:20.660
don't forget people in California the Golden State pinball festivals coming up

28:20.660 --> 28:26.000
next year not all the way for next year I'll mark my count in Lodi Wow okay it

28:26.000 --> 28:31.720
was it we used to be Pinagogo in Dixon yeah and the owner of the event I think

28:31.720 --> 28:37.940
sold it or gave it to somebody else and so they moved to Lodi in an

28:37.940 --> 28:43.660
air-conditioned facility that doesn't have corn pollen in it thank you God for

28:43.660 --> 28:48.700
it's now like Golden State pinball Expo or something I'll get news for it and

28:48.700 --> 28:51.980
post it and our to see it points out in our chat room at live dog network calm

28:51.980 --> 28:57.780
surely they have pins it it's a bunch of pinball absolutely but Golden State

28:57.780 --> 29:03.700
pinball festival is pinball yeah exclusive yes all right anything else

29:03.700 --> 29:09.580
for your gaming week no all right I'll talk about my gaming week then I will

29:09.580 --> 29:13.260
I'll be a little I'm gonna do pinball too but I'll be a little less on it than

29:13.260 --> 29:16.820
dark soccer but I did play because it just came out this week pinball FX 3

29:16.820 --> 29:20.980
just came out and so I downloaded it on Steam and if you didn't already know it

29:20.980 --> 29:25.060
imports a lot of the stuff that worked with pinball FX 2 I think some of the

29:25.060 --> 29:30.060
license stuff doesn't totally carry over but I mean like the Marvel stuff does

29:30.140 --> 29:33.740
the Star Wars stuff does there's a lot of it that does come over so that's

29:33.740 --> 29:37.460
pretty cool so I was you know playing some of those tables and so it's kind of

29:37.460 --> 29:40.380
like well what's different what's new about it well they have some more like

29:40.380 --> 29:42.780
competitive modes which I thought was cool is that you can do like a little

29:42.780 --> 29:49.260
tournament which was excuse me very similar to the Bethesda pinball app

29:49.260 --> 29:53.500
which some of those tables are in a separate app on iPhone and Android where

29:53.500 --> 29:56.780
you can kind of like play other people and if you beat their score you get

29:56.820 --> 30:00.300
season ranking points you're basically playing like a seasonal challenge type

30:00.300 --> 30:03.580
thing and I thought that was cool so I was playing a little bit of that so yeah

30:03.580 --> 30:08.060
I dabbled in but but the problem is I can't do every table in the season

30:08.060 --> 30:12.820
because I don't own all the tables so that's you know pinball FX if you didn't

30:12.820 --> 30:17.900
already know is free to play except you don't I don't know if it comes with any

30:17.900 --> 30:23.060
tables for free I think you can demo tables all of them for free but you have

30:23.060 --> 30:27.500
to actually purchase tables a la carte but one of the humble bundles a year or

30:27.500 --> 30:32.300
two ago had like 15 tables in one of the humble bundles and that's where I think

30:32.300 --> 30:38.940
I built my PC collection I have a pretty decent collection on PlayStation 4 as

30:38.940 --> 30:44.020
well but you know just from what I've collected over that era but thanks that

30:44.020 --> 30:47.940
humble bundle I have a ton on PC as well and Bobby Blackwolf and chat pointing

30:47.940 --> 30:51.540
out that sorcerers lair is free so there is one free one in there so that's

30:51.540 --> 30:54.620
pretty cool that they give you at least one and that is one of the tables that's

30:54.620 --> 30:58.300
in the tournament right now so you can even participate in the tournament just

30:58.300 --> 31:02.220
with the free tables that's pretty cool so I played a little bit of that I want

31:02.220 --> 31:06.100
to tell this story so I went I'm so tired today you guys because I took a

31:06.100 --> 31:10.500
trip yesterday to San Francisco and part of it was Rocky Horror related so I was

31:10.500 --> 31:14.780
up really late last night supporting the show over there but what we did earlier

31:14.780 --> 31:19.060
in the day when my pal JD who's been on the show before we took a trip over to

31:19.260 --> 31:23.340
Oakland and we actually went to the Museum of Art and Digital Entertainment

31:23.340 --> 31:26.900
which I never been to before I guess it's been around for like years and I

31:26.900 --> 31:30.820
not been over there but they were having their sixth anniversary special and JD

31:30.820 --> 31:33.180
found out about it on Facebook it was like Rob there's like a video game

31:33.180 --> 31:37.220
museum in Oakland I was like there is oh yeah I think I have heard of this and we

31:37.220 --> 31:42.940
just never fucking been so we went and it was cool like it's just um it's a lot

31:42.940 --> 31:47.700
of like it was basically okay dark Sakura imagine if your vault was the

31:47.700 --> 31:52.220
size of the house and you let strangers come in to play whatever games they

31:52.220 --> 31:57.060
wanted that was kind of the museum which I thought was kind of neat so but I was

31:57.060 --> 32:00.540
I was in problems but there's a part of me that's kind of like man what's the

32:00.540 --> 32:03.860
security like in this place because there's a lot of stuff that's not behind

32:03.860 --> 32:06.980
glass cases and I was like there's a lot of games on there they must have

32:06.980 --> 32:10.080
something that they don't they don't share the secrets with but yeah I had a

32:10.080 --> 32:12.940
good time when I went over and just you know looking at all the classic stuff

32:12.940 --> 32:15.700
and I did get my hands on something I did play even though there were quite a

32:15.740 --> 32:19.940
few people there I couldn't play everything but I did play and I know the

32:19.940 --> 32:22.740
first words out of Jamie's mouth watch are gonna be like why don't you just come

32:22.740 --> 32:28.860
over and play that at my house but the thing that I played was pac-man on a

32:28.860 --> 32:35.260
Atari 800 computer I don't have one really an Atari 800 okay by the way the

32:35.260 --> 32:37.940
game you're thinking of is tales of the Arabian Nights oh that's because

32:37.940 --> 32:43.380
Scheherazade was an RPG on the NES yes I can see how I get those two confused I

32:43.380 --> 32:47.180
love I knew Scheherazade okay tales of Arabian Nights that is it thank you for

32:47.180 --> 32:52.980
correcting me on that okay but anyway uh where was I so pack I we played pac-man

32:52.980 --> 32:57.300
on the Atari 800 because why not it was available and it was like hey this is

32:57.300 --> 33:02.400
old and it was actually it's it's a decent translation of pac-man believe it

33:02.400 --> 33:07.740
or not so yeah all right so yeah I had a good time at the museum so props to

33:07.740 --> 33:12.260
those guys over in Oakland they are located in Oakland at 3400 Broadway you

33:12.260 --> 33:16.040
can check out more information at the maid org I might reach out to them to

33:16.040 --> 33:19.020
see if we can get one of those guys on the show in the coming weeks to talk a

33:19.020 --> 33:21.340
little more about what it is they do over there because I thought it was

33:21.340 --> 33:25.020
pretty cool because one of the things I liked most about it was that I saw a lot

33:25.020 --> 33:30.980
of like people my age and their 30s late 30s bringing their kids and introducing

33:30.980 --> 33:34.300
their kids to old games so it's like you're gonna play pac-man the way I

33:34.300 --> 33:37.580
played pac-man I thought that was really cool you're gonna cry just like we did

33:37.580 --> 33:42.460
exactly so yeah I thought I thought that was really cool so props to those

33:42.460 --> 33:46.860
guys um as far as other stuff I don't know if I played a lot of other new

33:46.860 --> 33:50.520
stuff I guess two small things on Nintendo switch because they released a

33:50.520 --> 33:56.540
ton of stuff on Nintendo switch this week so I did pick up Mario Brothers in

33:56.540 --> 34:01.140
the arcade archives because you remember a couple weeks ago and Nintendo did that

34:01.140 --> 34:04.420
Nintendo direct and they mentioned that hey this arcade archives thing that's

34:04.420 --> 34:08.660
been all these neo geo games we're gonna expand that to Nintendo made arcade

34:08.660 --> 34:13.780
games from you know 83 and 84 in that era so Mario Brothers is the first one

34:13.780 --> 34:17.500
they put out and yes Mario Brothers has been out in several forms it was on the

34:17.500 --> 34:22.820
NES and then they it's it's in like it's in every frickin Mario advance they've

34:22.820 --> 34:28.420
done since then but nothing seems to recreate the original quite so well

34:28.420 --> 34:31.820
especially down to the sounds and the fact that the sound in that game was

34:31.820 --> 34:35.340
actually kind of garbage but that was the charm of it was that it was so

34:35.340 --> 34:40.340
garbage that the coin noises it's just like really like messed up but it's

34:40.340 --> 34:44.540
that's part of the charm of it it really took me back to being at the roller rink

34:44.540 --> 34:48.600
and playing arcade games and dating myself but what my roller rink game was

34:48.600 --> 34:54.140
right no I forget Frogger oh to the day that I can't play Frogger well unless

34:54.140 --> 34:58.620
I'm on roller skates my biggest one was spy hunter which always cracked me up

34:58.620 --> 35:04.580
because I had the pedal with roller skates exactly we had a stand-up pole

35:04.580 --> 35:10.520
position there but it was always broken um the Babalu in Dothan Alabama and then

35:10.520 --> 35:14.740
I also bought p-cross on the Nintendo switch I think it's called p-cross s is

35:14.740 --> 35:17.980
the actual name of it but I thought it's a cheap little game and it's one of

35:17.980 --> 35:21.180
those nice little games that's like oh I can pull the switch out while I'm like

35:21.180 --> 35:25.940
lying in bed and this is a good game to be able to play before I fall asleep but

35:25.940 --> 35:31.660
I need to stop I need to stop buying new games because it's fucking holding me

35:31.660 --> 35:35.140
back from finishing Samus Returns and this is an issue I need to go back and

35:35.140 --> 35:38.660
finish Samus Returns but there's one other game I got pulled into this week

35:38.660 --> 35:41.420
that I need to mention one other quick thing because it was one of those games

35:41.420 --> 35:45.700
was like I didn't play enough of this a year ago and it came out so I'm gonna

35:45.700 --> 35:48.900
just fucking fall down the rabbit hole hard this week and I played a lot of it

35:48.900 --> 35:51.900
over the last weekend and stuff last weekend not this weekend but the week

35:51.900 --> 35:57.220
before civilization six that's right remember civilization and how addicted

35:57.220 --> 35:59.980
we all get to that game and somehow I only played it a little bit when it

35:59.980 --> 36:02.660
first came out but then I just kind of resisted and there was all this other

36:02.660 --> 36:05.820
games coming out and I was able to stay away from it well this week I was kind

36:05.820 --> 36:09.860
of sitting there looking at steam and civ6 started saying come play me

36:09.860 --> 36:12.380
actually do you know what it really was do you know what it was that brought me

36:12.380 --> 36:16.300
back to civilization that made me think about it I don't know if you guys have

36:16.300 --> 36:20.820
watched Star Trek discovery yet but the opening credits made me think of

36:20.820 --> 36:24.900
civilization I don't know why but they did like just like that the animation

36:24.900 --> 36:28.900
made me think of like the intro to like Civ 4 or something like I don't know

36:28.900 --> 36:33.260
this weird like connect in my mind I was like I need to go play civilization and

36:33.260 --> 36:36.380
I do that I do that sometimes do you guys ever do that have you ever seen

36:36.380 --> 36:39.300
like a movie or something and it's like it's not as like it's not necessarily

36:39.300 --> 36:43.660
like you go see Resident Evil and you're like I need to play Resident Evil like I

36:43.660 --> 36:47.940
remember when I went and I saw the movie stardust in theaters I immediately had

36:47.940 --> 36:51.700
to come home and play Elder Scrolls Oblivion like have you ever had like

36:51.700 --> 36:56.140
something like trigger you to go like I need to play that game kind of would do

36:56.140 --> 37:01.020
anything you can think of I'm looking at our chat over at live dot vog network

37:01.020 --> 37:03.900
calm to see if anybody has one although I know we're a little delay no but

37:03.900 --> 37:12.340
crawl made me want to play D&D which one crawl I saw it in the theater as a kid

37:12.340 --> 37:16.260
but every time I see it I just want to break out you know the rule book and

37:16.260 --> 37:20.660
find people who want to do you know second edition with me everyone got a

37:20.660 --> 37:24.260
mini but me man in chat says I watched Friday the 13th and wanted to go home

37:24.260 --> 37:30.180
and play operation actually you know what I always won't play splatter house

37:30.180 --> 37:36.100
oh yeah why the stupid Friday the 13th game splatter fucking house splatter

37:36.100 --> 37:41.420
house splatter house kind of was Friday the 13th wink wink not it was much

37:41.420 --> 37:45.220
better than the game that had the name on it I love the NES one I don't give a

37:45.220 --> 37:49.220
fuck like I know people hate on the game all the time and I understand it is not

37:49.220 --> 37:52.980
a good game let me make that clear but there's a certain charm to it I just I

37:52.980 --> 37:58.740
can't get away from it's so good all right anyhow uh let's move on I want to

37:58.740 --> 38:02.300
talk a little more about some announcements here and then we'll get

38:02.300 --> 38:06.220
into some gaming news so you can always follow us on twitter twitter.com slash

38:06.220 --> 38:11.940
olr we're also on facebook facebook.com slash orange lounge radio I think we

38:11.940 --> 38:14.860
don't have any shows off scheduled in the coming weeks so we should be here

38:15.380 --> 38:20.060

38:20.060 --> 38:24.500
November 11th 12th maybe gone that weekend but unsure yet so we'll keep it

38:24.500 --> 38:28.860
posted because that's still over a month away so meanwhile we are gonna get into

38:28.860 --> 38:31.940
some gaming news let's do it let's start off tonight Loki's not here tonight so

38:31.940 --> 38:37.460
I'll start off tonight and let's oh what going you said the Loki's not here I

38:37.460 --> 38:41.380
know it's sad it is sad all right I'm still cuter he'll be back he'll be back

38:41.380 --> 38:47.140
next week so it sounds like folks that are in the Nintendo creators program I

38:47.140 --> 38:50.900
don't know if you remember this but this is a program that Nintendo wanted people

38:50.900 --> 38:55.220
to sign up for to basically validate their YouTube streams and enter a sort

38:55.220 --> 38:58.700
of revenue share with Nintendo and it was the way that Nintendo was going to

38:58.700 --> 39:04.140
stop basically like copyright claiming your videos all the time and and doing

39:04.140 --> 39:07.820
the monetization and that I am really oversimplifying the situation here for

39:07.820 --> 39:13.500
time so sorry but apparently folks that are in that program actually got sent an

39:13.500 --> 39:21.260
email talking about that live streams can no longer be done what yeah

39:21.260 --> 39:25.020
Nintendo's creator program sent an email that goes like this thank you for using

39:25.020 --> 39:28.220
the Nintendo creators program we've updated the Nintendo creators program

39:28.220 --> 39:31.500
user guide with information on how revenue generated during live stream

39:31.500 --> 39:35.580
broadcasts on YouTube will be handled in the Nintendo creators program live

39:35.580 --> 39:39.180
streaming on YouTube falls outside the scope of the Nintendo creators program

39:39.180 --> 39:43.500
this means that you cannot broadcast content on YouTube live from the account

39:43.500 --> 39:46.700
that you've registered to the Nintendo creators program please check the user

39:46.700 --> 39:51.620
guide for details thank you for your support blah blah blah blah blah like so

39:51.620 --> 39:56.820
what what does Nintendo have against their content creators doing live

39:56.820 --> 40:01.780
streams and that I guess is the piece that I'm not really figuring out like

40:01.780 --> 40:06.700
why did they maybe you guys know in our chat room over at live.vognetware.com

40:06.700 --> 40:13.340
but why did Nintendo suddenly decide to pull the plug on this did something go

40:13.340 --> 40:17.500
on where maybe like in a live stream something kind of nefarious and bad was

40:17.500 --> 40:21.300
going on and bad words were said and things like that during a Nintendo game

40:21.300 --> 40:25.580
and maybe Nintendo can't really monitor that stuff effectively I'm not sure what

40:25.580 --> 40:30.340
it is I feel like it's got to be a control thing at the end of the day yeah

40:30.380 --> 40:33.700
and that's what dark to see in our chat room kind of things over at live.vognetware.com

40:33.700 --> 40:37.700
maybe live streams are harder to police I'm really not sure

40:37.700 --> 40:43.180
Kaijuto says this this freaking streaming out tube game cutscenes BS is

40:43.180 --> 40:48.020
getting out of hand let's see vidpower in chat says does

40:48.020 --> 40:51.780
Nintendo's policy cover twitch as well well what's interesting about that is

40:51.780 --> 40:56.940
that the creators program wasn't for twitch it was for YouTube and all of the

40:56.980 --> 41:00.660
content that goes up on there because that's the on-demand content and

41:00.660 --> 41:06.580
obviously YouTube had their monetization program in advance kind of before twitch

41:06.580 --> 41:10.980
had theirs I mean twitch had the partner program but the twitch stuff has really

41:10.980 --> 41:15.740
blown up with the affiliation and the bits and subscribers through all that

41:15.740 --> 41:19.500
program so I'm not sure Nintendo has figured out how to battle the whole

41:19.500 --> 41:24.220
twitch thing or if they can but I wonder if that's not gonna be something that

41:24.220 --> 41:27.700
doesn't happen before the end of the year maybe it's kind of starting with

41:27.700 --> 41:33.020
this YouTube thing but certainly that's one of the places my gut goes is well

41:33.020 --> 41:37.660
are these YouTube creators then just gonna go over to twitch although I don't

41:37.660 --> 41:41.180
know that might be a really hard thing to do to have your audience go with you

41:41.180 --> 41:44.820
you know like that's you don't want to risk losing your audience over a move

41:44.820 --> 41:49.380
like that I don't know tiger claw chat says this is why streaming on YouTube

41:49.380 --> 41:53.220
isn't a good idea to begin with everything is all nice and dandy on

41:53.260 --> 41:57.260
twitch well I don't think YouTube would want to think they think about it like

41:57.260 --> 42:00.980
that and then where does mixer fit into all of this and I know there's an easy

42:00.980 --> 42:07.100
joke to make there about it doesn't because nobody in the mixer but the

42:07.100 --> 42:11.740
reality is Microsoft is not gonna stop pushing mixer and mixer does have some

42:11.740 --> 42:16.340
things that you know separated apart from the competition so you know we have

42:16.340 --> 42:20.060
to consider that as well how is mixer gonna fit in all that whole equation

42:20.260 --> 42:24.260
probably whatever ends up happening to twitch is gonna happen a mixer but we'll

42:24.260 --> 42:29.780
see I don't know so there you go that's something that's happened I don't know

42:29.780 --> 42:33.340
what the future holds for the streaming program Dark Sakura do you think

42:33.340 --> 42:39.540
Nintendo needs to stop doing this to their streaming population the people

42:39.540 --> 42:43.600
that evangelize their games or does Nintendo have the fucking right to say

42:43.600 --> 42:48.060
our games our rules Nintendo has the right to say our games our rules but

42:48.100 --> 42:53.620
they need to be willing to give a little bit to their fan base you know there has

42:53.620 --> 42:58.860
to be a balance and I think that they're just taking that we need all the control

42:58.860 --> 43:05.460
ever to all the things line that they always do so I mean it's not really a

43:05.460 --> 43:10.140
should they or should they not it's a they've already done it it doesn't

43:10.140 --> 43:14.300
matter what we think they should do does that make sense no no I mean totally it

43:14.300 --> 43:17.380
does I mean you're right we can whine and bitch and moan all we want but at

43:17.380 --> 43:21.100
the end of the day Nintendo can do do whatever they want to do with their

43:21.100 --> 43:25.420
copyright but Jamie I guess an important you know thing to keep in mind is that

43:25.420 --> 43:30.860
these YouTube creators then in turn have the right to ask themselves do I want to

43:30.860 --> 43:35.420
keep supporting Nintendo or am I gonna tell them to fuck off I mean and that

43:35.420 --> 43:39.420
will be the interesting thing as a result of this but it's I think it's

43:39.420 --> 43:45.260
really hard for a lot of people to walk away from Nintendo because of the fact

43:45.300 --> 43:52.020
they have such gigantic behemoth things for this Super Nintendo classic I'm sure

43:52.020 --> 43:56.740
tons of people are streaming gameplay on all 21 of these games right now but this

43:56.740 --> 44:00.580
would all you know be a part of that you know and when Nintendo does put out a

44:00.580 --> 44:04.060
game like when Mario Odyssey comes out there's gonna be tons of people that

44:04.060 --> 44:07.140
want in on that I want to watch people play it and want to stream it and so on

44:07.140 --> 44:10.740
and so on I mean no matter what Nintendo's rules on the whole thing

44:10.740 --> 44:16.580
might be dark Tetsuya playing a nice line here saying meet the fans in the

44:16.580 --> 44:21.820
middle I agree though it could be worse it could be like Atlas and persona 5

44:21.820 --> 44:26.980
which I think is still on what somewhat under embargo and he's referencing that

44:26.980 --> 44:30.940
whole rules and restrictions that Atlas put out about we're gonna copyright

44:30.940 --> 44:34.660
strike you if you broadcast past a certain date in game remember that whole

44:34.660 --> 44:41.180
thing so that was a little bit too much over the edge so Tigerclaw pointing out

44:41.180 --> 44:44.280
that people are streaming Samus Returns on Twitch and you know what's

44:44.280 --> 44:48.380
interesting about that Tigerclaw streaming from the 3ds isn't exactly

44:48.380 --> 44:53.700
easy to do I mean as far as I know and correct me if I'm wrong but I think you

44:53.700 --> 45:00.140
have to modify a 3ds like you have to pay like a bit of money like hundreds of

45:00.140 --> 45:06.260
dollars maybe like 200 $300 to mod your 3ds to put in a capture device to be

45:06.260 --> 45:10.420
able to stream from the 3ds because it doesn't have like a built-in HDMI output

45:10.420 --> 45:14.580
or anything like that the switch is different it has HDMI output so you can

45:14.580 --> 45:18.300
use the same capture card that most people are using for other devices like

45:18.300 --> 45:22.660
PlayStation 4 external of the native streaming same thing with Xbox one so

45:22.660 --> 45:29.300
and as a live streamer on twitch twitch TV slash Rob Roberts plug plug it's easy

45:29.300 --> 45:32.180
to straight if you have a capture card streaming on the switch is fucking easy

45:32.180 --> 45:37.540
but I can't do the 3ds yeah and Tiger cloud points out you modify your 3ds or

45:37.540 --> 45:41.700
you can buy a 3ds with a capture device installed exactly as its cost it costs a

45:41.700 --> 45:45.540
bit more money and the reason why I point that out is that like these fans

45:45.540 --> 45:51.420
on Twitch are paying more money to be able to stream Nintendo's games now

45:51.420 --> 45:56.300
granted you know some of the more successful ones get their bits and

45:56.300 --> 46:00.140
their subscribes and they're you know high viewer counts and their money they

46:00.140 --> 46:03.420
get their money back on that investment it's a business investment for some

46:03.420 --> 46:08.540
people but for many makes it a tax write-off for many it's not well if you

46:08.540 --> 46:12.020
have the paperwork filed to have your own business yeah as your streaming

46:12.020 --> 46:15.660
business as a business I would wonder how many of twitches top streamers

46:15.660 --> 46:21.740
actually have registered LLCs you'd be surprised you think it was on like one

46:21.740 --> 46:25.100
of the you know how to monetize your twitch things I was looking at I guess

46:25.100 --> 46:28.660
when you get to a certain point somebody probably approaches you and

46:28.660 --> 46:32.460
says have you thought about this for I guess that probably happens to a lot of

46:32.460 --> 46:36.740
people I don't know I'll never get there what do I know although it would to be

46:36.740 --> 46:42.140
fair vog is an LLC and Bobby really figured a lot of that stuff out that I

46:42.140 --> 46:46.260
couldn't figure out but we do have that business end of things but we're not

46:46.260 --> 46:50.240
really making money off this venture we just have it so that when we try to

46:50.240 --> 46:53.620
approach conventions for sponsorships and things like that people know we're

46:53.620 --> 46:57.280
serious that we are a business and that we're not just you individuals so we

46:57.280 --> 47:01.420
have it more for the you know being able to have formal paperwork sort of thing

47:01.420 --> 47:06.980
formalizing a lot of things and yeah and hopefully in the future maybe some extra

47:06.980 --> 47:11.160
stuff yeah and Bobby's pointing out you do have an LLC well yes I know what but

47:11.160 --> 47:16.260
that's see Bobby I don't have my own LLC that's a little difference a little

47:16.260 --> 47:20.660
difference there all right anyway let's move on more Nintendo fuckery right

47:20.660 --> 47:28.900
yeah well the Wii shop channel is going to be shutting down in 2019 January so

47:28.900 --> 47:35.500
that is a year and a few months you know coming down the line and that means that

47:35.500 --> 47:41.100
all of the virtual console titles that are there to be purchased will be going

47:41.100 --> 47:47.980
away right alongside it including you know games like Kirby's

47:47.980 --> 47:55.180
avalanche act razor Super Smash Brothers already you know going away and

47:55.180 --> 47:59.420
then when it goes you won't be able to buy those games anymore I don't know

47:59.420 --> 48:02.340
anything about still being able to play them but you won't be able to buy them

48:02.340 --> 48:08.500
anymore and of course there's no virtual console on the switch so I think that

48:08.500 --> 48:12.040
that might be where all these minis are coming from you know to corner the

48:12.040 --> 48:21.520
market on it so it's it's sad but not unsurprising you know sad yeah it's it's

48:21.520 --> 48:26.960
also kind of that whole like shock of here is the digital era that we live in

48:26.960 --> 48:32.200
when we buy all this stuff online the reality that someday these stores are

48:32.200 --> 48:35.560
gonna close and that's kind of the scary part of this is that you know if you

48:35.560 --> 48:39.200
bought all these games online I mean you're not gonna be able to download

48:39.400 --> 48:45.680
them again after now granted after 2019 on what will essentially be a 13 year

48:45.680 --> 48:51.720
old console at that point but Jamie you as a console collector now I guess the

48:51.720 --> 48:54.800
easy answer is you don't buy a lot of stuff online I'm sure you don't because

48:54.800 --> 48:57.320
you know you get the cartridges and stuff but there's a lot of stuff you

48:57.320 --> 49:01.720
could only buy online you know there's there was you know releases on we shop

49:01.720 --> 49:05.680
that were only online for example the after years Final Fantasy for the after

49:05.680 --> 49:09.280
years yeah that was only on the we shop and I'm not gonna be able to download

49:09.280 --> 49:15.000
that anymore so it's like if I have memory loss on my little cartridge or

49:15.000 --> 49:19.040
some type of rot or something like that I don't know or it damages them out it's

49:19.040 --> 49:24.760
gone forever yeah that's kind of kind of scary I don't know I mean I guess in the

49:24.760 --> 49:29.160
reality you could lose a cartridge the same way but still I don't know it's

49:29.160 --> 49:32.760
just I guess sometimes we think like oh we'll be able to access these games

49:32.760 --> 49:36.800
whenever we want but that doesn't really end up holding true what do you

49:36.800 --> 49:40.240
think it's a collector about that does that kind of like irritate you that

49:40.240 --> 49:43.040
there's not gonna be any way to download these games again or is it just one of

49:43.040 --> 49:47.800
those well it just is more incentive to get backups on SD cards as fast as

49:47.800 --> 49:55.040
possible um I just think it's sad you know it's it's taking away a service I

49:55.040 --> 49:59.800
mean for the people who've already paid for it I think they're just like oh well

49:59.800 --> 50:05.360
sorry we got your money fuck you some comments in chat over at live dog

50:05.360 --> 50:09.480
network comm stop he points out that blaster master sequel was only on the

50:09.480 --> 50:14.240
e-store that's true even though blast master zero is better but certainly you

50:14.240 --> 50:18.280
know you still the completionist want to visit all the games let's see Bob coffee

50:18.280 --> 50:23.080
and chat says after years got released on steam and PSP as part of its Final

50:23.080 --> 50:29.040
Fantasy 4 part if it port if I recall correctly I believe force the steam

50:29.080 --> 50:33.920
release I can't remember the PSP one but for the steam release that was done in

50:33.920 --> 50:38.560
the 3d style the one that was on the Wii was still the sprite based it was like

50:38.560 --> 50:42.280
it looked like a fucking ROM hacked Final Fantasy 2 you know what I mean

50:42.280 --> 50:47.200
cartridge is what it looked like on the Wii shop so it was kind of different on

50:47.200 --> 50:51.880
steam and you know some people want to see one way versus the other you know so

50:51.880 --> 50:56.240
Tigerclaw points out excite bike world rally was a game that I bought on the

50:56.240 --> 51:00.080
Wii shop I bought some Castlevania game on the Wii shop that was a remake I

51:00.080 --> 51:04.120
think of the Gameboy game that they put on the Wii shop at one point and so that

51:04.120 --> 51:08.560
will be gone forever here's the other thing to realize too is that some of the

51:08.560 --> 51:14.440
games on here they aren't just Nintendo games I mean you've got at the Alex Kidd

51:14.440 --> 51:21.320
series you've got a lot of the the Neo Geo games so these are the virtual

51:21.320 --> 51:24.720
console games that will no longer be available because they're not on Wii U

51:24.720 --> 51:28.360
eShop which is different Wii U eShop is different any of that stuff yeah

51:28.360 --> 51:34.280
Castlevania Rondo of blood hmm which good luck finding the PC Engine version

51:34.280 --> 51:38.920
y'all unless the switch gets all this well there was the re-release but I mean

51:38.920 --> 51:44.400
like the original yeah but I mean a lot of us kind of wonder oh well maybe the

51:44.400 --> 51:48.800
switch will come in D the switch will compensate for a lot of this stuff going

51:48.800 --> 51:53.400
away but things will have to be re-licensed agreements will have to be

51:53.400 --> 51:56.680
remade and maybe they won't be able to get an agreement to put out Rondo of

51:56.680 --> 52:03.720
blood again who knows so was I have a feeling because we live in the day and

52:03.720 --> 52:08.640
age where Star Fox 2 was dumped to a cartridge before the Super Nintendo

52:08.640 --> 52:12.760
Classic was released we live in a day and age where and it this is really

52:12.760 --> 52:16.120
probably already out there I just don't go out there and find it but I'm

52:16.120 --> 52:20.320
confident it's out there there's probably just a Wii emulator on your PC

52:20.320 --> 52:25.680
that you can someday put on a Raspberry Pi maybe you can't now but you will

52:25.680 --> 52:30.840
someday and all of these games that were on the eShop one day will have backups

52:30.840 --> 52:34.320
available online that are open to be able to play on emulators like I'm I'm

52:34.320 --> 52:38.440
confident that sort of technology to at least do it on the PC has got to already

52:38.440 --> 52:43.600
be there I just haven't gone looking for it on the dark web or whatever you want

52:43.600 --> 52:49.440
to call it so uh guys you doing chat says so where is the Wii shop on the

52:49.440 --> 52:53.960
Wii yes we're talking specifically about the Nintendo Wiis built-in shop

52:53.960 --> 53:00.840
that will no longer you can't buy or use anything on it after 2019 with early

53:00.840 --> 53:04.880
2019 and you're not even gonna be able to add points so you can buy anything

53:04.880 --> 53:11.000
new after March of 2018 so you have now from now until March 2018 to get

53:11.000 --> 53:14.880
everything you ever wanted off that shop and that's it it closes after that and

53:14.880 --> 53:19.000
then it stays up for a basically another year so you can download backups and

53:19.040 --> 53:26.080
that's about it so all right um the entire class says I'm sure it will be

53:26.080 --> 53:29.720
possible since those games can be transferred to an SD card absolutely now

53:29.720 --> 53:34.040
the Wii U the eShop on Wii U that is staying open we don't know I have any

53:34.040 --> 53:37.840
word about that at this time but the reason why you keep seeing the Wii U in

53:37.840 --> 53:43.800
news stories about this is because every Wii U has a Wii in it you can do the

53:43.800 --> 53:48.080
backwards compatibility thing and you launch it in Wii mode and that includes

53:48.200 --> 53:53.720
a Wii shop on your Wii U because it's a full Nintendo Wii emulator so that's why

53:53.720 --> 53:57.480
you keep seeing that it's shutting down on the Wii U as well because it's the

53:57.480 --> 54:00.840
emulator part of it you're gonna be able to use so that's that's why it's all

54:00.840 --> 54:04.960
kind of together like that so all right in case you know says I thought the Wii

54:04.960 --> 54:08.880
shops been closed already maybe there's many people that can already think that

54:08.880 --> 54:14.000
so I mean you know to be fair when was last time you turned on your Nintendo

54:14.000 --> 54:18.880
Wii it's been a very very long time yeah I only use it now to play GameCube

54:18.880 --> 54:22.840
games because I have the older Wii that can play GameCube games because all my

54:22.840 --> 54:27.240
Wii data is on my Wii U I move pretty much that once we got our Wii U yeah

54:27.240 --> 54:31.080
moved everything over exactly so I don't really have anything on the Wii with the

54:31.080 --> 54:34.700
regular Wii anymore except the fact it's the only way I can play f-zero GX in my

54:34.700 --> 54:38.680
house because I don't even have a GameCube right now so but I'll take it all

54:38.680 --> 54:44.280
right and dark Tetsuya points out well aren't the Wii U switch and 3ds don't

54:44.280 --> 54:48.520
they all connect to the same store the e-shop that's a good point maybe I know

54:48.520 --> 54:52.280
because they do call it the e-shop across all the platforms I don't know if

54:52.280 --> 54:57.000
3ds shop and switch e-shop and all that stuff are different but maybe we won't

54:57.000 --> 55:01.880
see this problem for the Wii U as quick as we think we might but anyway let's

55:01.880 --> 55:05.400
move on with some more news so don't spend too much time on things going away

55:05.400 --> 55:11.480
in a year and a half steam valve the guys behind steam taken on some fake

55:11.480 --> 55:17.960
games that were listed in steam 173 games removed from steam most of them

55:17.960 --> 55:23.640
made by a company called silicon echo studio and you can't buy them but if you

55:23.640 --> 55:27.340
happen to own one of these games you can still play them however no more trading

55:27.340 --> 55:31.520
cards will be available so if you bought it you can play the game but the games

55:31.560 --> 55:36.600
themselves are gone and the reason why I guess this whole thing went down is

55:36.600 --> 55:42.120
because the same company that owned this silicon echo and zonotron productions

55:42.120 --> 55:47.080
they were doing unity asset flips on steam and very cheap bundles outside of

55:47.080 --> 55:51.440
steam so all these the money they were basically getting was the trading card

55:51.440 --> 55:56.080
stuff so they were just basically you know throwing a bunch of garbage unity

55:56.080 --> 55:59.680
stuff together and then having the trading cards spit out and that's where

55:59.680 --> 56:03.360
they were essentially making their money was that whole thing and so people

56:03.360 --> 56:06.800
that wanted to boost their profile levels and really get into the trading

56:06.800 --> 56:11.240
card game and all that stuff that they would buy these really you know junk

56:11.240 --> 56:16.600
games to do it that's crazy so yeah cracking down on the

56:16.600 --> 56:20.800
proc practices is basically the reason for the policy valve saying that these

56:20.800 --> 56:24.160
games were removed from a few different steamworks accounts that were all run by

56:24.160 --> 56:28.320
the same person in valves full statements they said yes we have a

56:28.320 --> 56:32.040
full-time team monitoring reports then they identified an issue that led to the

56:32.040 --> 56:34.920
removal of some titles from a few different steamworks accounts these

56:34.920 --> 56:38.000
accounts are generating generating a lot of reports and frustration from

56:38.000 --> 56:41.580
customers and other developers it turns out the bad actors were all the same

56:41.580 --> 56:46.800
person operating under different accounts so steam trying to clean all

56:46.800 --> 56:53.120
the poop out of their store basically and also just a quick follow-up here in

56:53.120 --> 56:58.760
our chat over at live dog network calm Rama says the e-shops are web-based so

56:58.760 --> 57:01.760
they're shutting down the app and the links that to that specific shop for

57:01.760 --> 57:06.120
that console most likely each different e-shop leads to a mobile site that's

57:06.120 --> 57:09.640
probably true considering that the switch basically has a web browser in it

57:09.640 --> 57:14.920
you just don't have the full power of it unlocked yet yeah and Bobby black wolf

57:14.920 --> 57:19.320
pointing out that my we died before I got a Wii U I lost all my saves and

57:19.320 --> 57:23.400
never transferred data my fiance has a we because she got a lot of the fitness

57:23.400 --> 57:27.880
games she showed me today she was like 20 we fitness games but that's not

57:27.880 --> 57:31.080
surprising because that was some of the bread and butter of the we and what they

57:31.080 --> 57:37.640
sold a lot of those fitness games to register participation for this week's

57:37.640 --> 57:41.800
episode of orange andreide with vog network.com use the passphrase cherry

57:41.800 --> 57:48.800
anyhow let us move on dark soccer this has been one that affects several people

57:48.800 --> 58:00.160
that we know I mean first-hand that the SAG after a strike is tentatively over

58:00.160 --> 58:06.680
the strike's been going on for a year now since last October and they put out

58:06.680 --> 58:11.120
a press release saying that the agreement that they have right now will

58:11.120 --> 58:17.200
give them additional bonuses based on the number of recording sessions per

58:17.200 --> 58:23.200
game with $75 payments for the first session going up to 2100 after 10

58:23.200 --> 58:29.320
sessions and that the payment is due no later than the release date of a game

58:29.320 --> 58:36.160
which is good because that gives them a significant increase to what they were

58:36.160 --> 58:43.800
making per per session and you know we'll also because I mean think about it

58:43.800 --> 58:49.880
your voice is your tool in that field and if you are having to change the way

58:49.880 --> 58:59.760
you speak or you know you're playing a murder victim in some game yeah you're

58:59.760 --> 59:04.200
doing damage to yourself and so yeah it should be compensated and they're also

59:04.200 --> 59:12.480
working on providing provisions for health issues like vocal stress and you

59:12.480 --> 59:16.640
know how there's a habit of finding people for being late or distracted at a

59:16.640 --> 59:25.880
session session and another one that would have required agents support their

59:25.880 --> 59:31.760
perform submit their performers for atmospheric voice sessions or face fines

59:31.760 --> 59:36.880
and those those sessions are really low-paying anyway so it's a lot of it is

59:36.880 --> 59:42.680
they're really working on just again trying to make voice actors as protected

59:42.680 --> 59:47.560
as other workers yeah so it's you know it's kind of scary how much we didn't

59:47.560 --> 59:50.320
really hear about this like it was really kind of you know when it first

59:50.320 --> 59:54.240
happened we were talking a lot about it and then and I say we not to just mean

59:54.240 --> 59:58.080
us here olr but I mean just like the the gaming blog world and then it's kind of

59:58.080 --> 01:00:02.600
like it just the issue disappeared for a long time and I don't know if we've

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:05.720
really seen the full effects of this yet I mean we have a little bit like for

01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:09.360
example there's a new voice actor actress in life is strange the prequel

01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:12.400
right cuz the one from before couldn't come back I don't know if we've seen the

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:17.320
full brunt of that yet but you know it's it's I'm happy this finally got

01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:23.440
resolved because you know who knows what games in 2019 would look like without

01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:28.080
the voice you know with Jennifer Hale not be able to do them or Nolan North or

01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:32.680
some of the you know big names that you come to know so it would definitely be

01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:41.880
sad but I would much rather see voice actors paid their true worth I'd rather

01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:46.000
see them valued for the amazing work that they do I'm glad they worked it out

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:51.480
are working it out it's not complete yet okay but you know like it says it's

01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:57.200
tentative all right yeah I'm glad they're almost there all right well

01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:00.760
moving on to one more thing before we get to the classic game or is it system

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:06.880
of the week let's get into a story about Atlas and DMCA takedowns and persona 5

01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:09.840
but it's not what you think it's not the whole YouTube streaming thing we were

01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:14.080
talking about earlier this is a little bit different this is an emulation group

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:18.200
called Nikko tikina I hope I'm saying that or no neko technica I think is that

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:21.000
sorry I've totally read that wrong the first time neko technica I think would

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:25.720
be their name and these guys actually had a patreon page that they were

01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:31.520
running for a game for a piece of software called RPC s3 it was a ps3

01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:37.680
emulator being used to play persona 5 and so they basically were able to get

01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:42.600
this emulator to work to basically be able to play persona 5 on your PC they

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:47.160
actually put up a blog post over atlas to justify why this action was necessary

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:53.160
but like if you're gonna go to patreon and ask for money for this type of stuff

01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:57.000
you got to really watch how you're selling this type of stuff I'm totally

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:01.000
like I don't I don't even need the statement from atlas to understand what

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:05.360
happened here and it's kind of like the whole thing with the Super Mario 64 and

01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:09.760
Nintendo going after them like I don't like Nintendo going after these products

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:13.920
but when they go to patreon and essentially ask for money and they're

01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:17.200
kind of bold enough to tie the intellectual property from these

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:23.680
companies to the patreon like I'm sorry but what did you think was gonna happen

01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:27.640
especially with a company like Nintendo or in this case atlas which we know is

01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:33.000
covered bases that are in a different ballgame yeah that's really the heart of

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.560
it dar tazuya and chats as a patreon I'm surprised Sony hasn't gone after them in

01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:41.700
that case huh anyway atlas in their statement said we don't want their

01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:45.720
players first experiences to be frame rate drops or crashes or other issues

01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:49.760
that can crop up an emulation that we have not personally overseen we

01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:53.140
understand that many persona fans would love to see a PC version and while we

01:02:53.140 --> 01:02:56.680
don't have anything to announce today we are listening for now the best way to

01:02:56.680 --> 01:03:01.200
experience persona 5 is on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3 and they actually can

01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:04.520
again they kind of go out of there I think they do more than Nintendo usually

01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:08.640
does in these cases to say we appreciate the buzz and awareness that the

01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:13.420
emulation communities to see this but and nowhere in their statement did they

01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:19.500
say but it's fucking illegal yeah so you know although well I should I should

01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:23.180
let me let me correct myself before the people jump all over what I just said

01:03:23.180 --> 01:03:28.980
the practice of the emulation itself the emulator isn't necessarily illegal right

01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:33.500
but it's when you tie these popular games and you're kind of implying that

01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:38.300
you know you use these to play these games and and then putting it on your

01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:41.900
patreon and all that stuff you that's when you get yourself into trouble you

01:03:41.900 --> 01:03:46.980
have to stick to homebrew stick to homebrew underground PlayStation 3 games

01:03:46.980 --> 01:03:50.860
homemade you know that weren't ever licensed by Sony in the first place

01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:54.100
that's the best way to pitch your emulator now I want to see what this

01:03:54.100 --> 01:03:58.940
emulators like were you able to find it somewhere no well no I I mean I'm just

01:03:58.940 --> 01:04:02.740
kind of curious about of course I'm still you know trying to get my brain

01:04:02.740 --> 01:04:07.740
figuring out how to play planet Harriers yeah Bobby Blackwell says at least stick

01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:10.540
to homebrew on the patreon page I mean the interesting thing about this and to

01:04:10.540 --> 01:04:13.420
be fair to the emulator team and all this stuff because again I don't want to

01:04:13.420 --> 01:04:17.780
sound like a complete asshole to what these guys are doing my assumption of

01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:22.100
this whole thing is that you have to have the persona 3 excuse me persona 3

01:04:22.100 --> 01:04:27.540
persona 5 disc to put in your computer's blu-ray player to be able to emulate it

01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:31.300
so you know and that's what atlas is also taking issue with is that because

01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:34.820
the emulators kind of choppy that actual disc is coming through kind of choppy

01:04:34.820 --> 01:04:37.460
because it was not meant to be played on your PC it was meant to be played on a

01:04:37.460 --> 01:04:42.780
PlayStation 3 so it's the emulator people were not really encouraging you

01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:49.180
to steal games but by putting the games IPs in their emulator it is kind of

01:04:49.180 --> 01:04:53.100
encouraging people to do something that Alice doesn't want them to do so because

01:04:53.100 --> 01:04:56.740
I think technically it isn't the end-user license agreement although we

01:04:56.740 --> 01:05:02.660
all know that's a bit of a gray area and Bobby Blackwell said they actually give

01:05:02.660 --> 01:05:05.940
instructions on how to dump it on the patreon and that was the part that Atlas

01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:08.620
was upset about they gave you instructions on how to dump either the

01:05:08.620 --> 01:05:11.900
blu-ray or the digital download from your PlayStation 3 hard drive well

01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:16.580
that's that is the giant fucking problem right there period dungeon buster in

01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:21.040
chat says but if I own the original copy of the game my ps3 dies and I still want

01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:25.380
to play it I'm just screwed no get yourself an emulator dungeon buster just

01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:29.060
get yourself an emulator that doesn't put a patreon page up saying how to dump

01:05:29.060 --> 01:05:32.700
commercial games and putting pictures of those commercial games over it does that

01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:40.620
make sense so all right let's move on to the classic game of the week that

01:05:40.620 --> 01:05:45.380
with those first emulators that came out for those classic games although this

01:05:45.380 --> 01:05:50.420
week we have a twist because once a month dark soccer likes to dump into the

01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:56.300
gaming dump jump into the gaming vault take a big no I she she dumps all her

01:05:56.300 --> 01:06:01.020
games out off the shelf anyway that's the cat once a month she likes to find a

01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:04.740
system that she thinks is worthy of your attention and a little mini

01:06:04.740 --> 01:06:09.540
programming note tonight this is actually September's console of the

01:06:09.540 --> 01:06:13.420
month because reasons dark soccer was gonna do it last week but she was out

01:06:13.420 --> 01:06:17.660
last week so we no longer it was not able to do this so this is this is one

01:06:17.660 --> 01:06:24.460
day late this is a tardy and do classic game but I had the flu so this is a

01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:28.100
tardy entry for September's classic system of the month yeah yeah all right

01:06:28.100 --> 01:06:32.620
here it is what is the classic system of the month the Panasonic Q also

01:06:32.620 --> 01:06:38.620
sometimes known as just Q and game Q and of course you put Animal Crossing as the

01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:45.260
music here oh shit of course you did yeah so this is basically the game turn

01:06:45.260 --> 01:06:49.780
it up a bit you picked the GameCube tonight I think the GameCube but you're

01:06:49.780 --> 01:06:55.420
you're making a hipster by picking the hipster GameCube is what you did it was

01:06:55.420 --> 01:06:59.340
cool I wouldn't mind having one actually it actually is cool but I'll

01:06:59.340 --> 01:07:03.860
let you talk about it and it's a hybrid GameCube and DVD player that was

01:07:03.860 --> 01:07:10.580
manufactured by Panasonic be it only came out in Japan and it was meant to do

01:07:10.580 --> 01:07:15.980
what the Xbox and PlayStation 2 were doing which as in have a commercial DVD

01:07:15.980 --> 01:07:23.660
you know playback function instead of just using the Nintendo optical discs

01:07:23.660 --> 01:07:33.580
the Q was actually licensed by Nintendo to Panasonic as Panasonic made actually

01:07:33.580 --> 01:07:39.940
it wasn't necessarily a Panasonic it was a result of a deal that was a broker

01:07:39.940 --> 01:07:48.220
between much yeah I miss said that much cheetah who owned Panasonic and Nintendo

01:07:48.260 --> 01:07:54.420
and so when Nintendo said that they could produce the optical disc drives

01:07:54.420 --> 01:08:01.500
that they had an agreement allowing Matsuda to produce a DVD system with the

01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:10.220
ability to play GameCube games so it went into production on December 13 well

01:08:10.220 --> 01:08:15.100
it was released on September sorry December 13 2001 for roughly four

01:08:15.100 --> 01:08:21.460
hundred and thirty nine dollars u.s. and ceased production on December 18 2003

01:08:21.460 --> 01:08:30.860
because not a lot of people bought it so it has a backlit LCD screen a front

01:08:30.860 --> 01:08:34.580
loading slot trade that actually had a lot of problems with it because of the

01:08:34.580 --> 01:08:42.620
rubber band in the motor would get brittle and snap but it had sound output

01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:50.340
in Dolby Digital 5.1 or DTS a separate subwoofer with a subwoofer boost and a

01:08:50.340 --> 01:08:56.500
really nice stainless steel chassis it came with gray controllers that had the

01:08:56.500 --> 01:09:01.820
Panasonic brand on it the thing is cool is that when you plug them in the little

01:09:01.820 --> 01:09:07.620
lights around the controller ports light up blue so it says blue on you know this

01:09:07.620 --> 01:09:15.700
polished steel finish and it was really neat but because of the legs it had on

01:09:15.700 --> 01:09:21.260
the bottom it actually had a special Panasonic Q Game Boy player that was

01:09:21.260 --> 01:09:26.220
designed specifically for it whereas the GameCube had you know its own version

01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:33.860
but yeah there was actually the buttons that are on the front of it it has one

01:09:33.860 --> 01:09:38.540
of the ones that I thought was neat is it has a surround sound virtualizer to

01:09:38.540 --> 01:09:44.100
it which you know it just boosts the channel output does sound like surround

01:09:44.100 --> 01:09:49.100
sound you know it's got your typical DVD buttons on it's got memory card ports on

01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:56.300
the side but I do like that it has like a bass boost another neat thing that it

01:09:56.300 --> 01:10:01.820
does now I've watched videos of DVD playback on it there's like a cinema

01:10:01.820 --> 01:10:06.380
mode that changes the illumination on the screen you know how it displays the

01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:11.780
video but there's also a dialogue booster which makes of course dialogues

01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:16.700
or whatever channel the dialogue might be in stand out from the background

01:10:16.700 --> 01:10:20.620
noise no surprise that Panasonic would have all these sound altering things

01:10:20.620 --> 01:10:23.660
right because that's kind of you know something they're known for that's one

01:10:23.660 --> 01:10:26.740
thing that I thought was really neat about it especially I was thinking about

01:10:26.740 --> 01:10:30.740
people who like a problem that I have sometimes is that if there's too much

01:10:30.740 --> 01:10:36.420
sound or like for example you have two people talking the voice all turns to

01:10:36.420 --> 01:10:40.380
mush for me you just like like the teachers in you know Charlie Brown

01:10:40.380 --> 01:10:49.380
specials and something like that would be wonderful to have but and on top of

01:10:49.380 --> 01:10:55.740
that too just it's a sharp looking little system it's you know it's got

01:10:55.740 --> 01:11:01.940
that steel body with the the clear cover around it it has that shiny front

01:11:01.940 --> 01:11:08.020
finish and on the back too I mean the thing has got some very interesting

01:11:08.020 --> 01:11:18.340
hookups on it hold on we have optical out we have a standard composite s video

01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:27.300
digital AV out it really is just for its time it's really really something

01:11:27.300 --> 01:11:31.980
else and so I you know I don't think it got a lot of appreciation you know

01:11:31.980 --> 01:11:35.620
people either already had their DVD players at the time but then again I

01:11:35.620 --> 01:11:40.260
know people who picked up ps2s to have a DVD player the other thing too is it

01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:44.380
actually does have video CD capability in it too if people still have those

01:11:44.380 --> 01:11:50.180
things so there you go all right there it is on the queue the

01:11:50.180 --> 01:11:53.660
classic console of the month Panasonic cute the GameCube she picked the

01:11:53.660 --> 01:11:58.980
GameCube everybody no I picked the GameCube I I actually you know the queue

01:11:58.980 --> 01:12:02.860
is absolutely as much crap as I'm giving Jamie this is absolutely a recognizable

01:12:02.860 --> 01:12:06.660
thing because of the fact it was like it was like this existing console that kind

01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:10.500
of had a fresh coat of paint that was very unique that of course we didn't get

01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:13.420
in the u.s. well and it's not the first time something like that has happened

01:12:13.460 --> 01:12:17.620
because remember we had the sharp twin Famicom kind of the last one I can

01:12:17.620 --> 01:12:26.320
think of yeah I think since then because there was the the Sega one that had the

01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:30.700
Sega CD playable yeah that would have been before GameCube was that that

01:12:30.700 --> 01:12:37.300
wasn't also Panasonic was it no remember and then sharp had the Famicom TV in

01:12:37.300 --> 01:12:43.180
Japan the closest thing I can think of is how the PlayStation TV thing is built

01:12:43.180 --> 01:12:48.220
into certain Sam is the Samsung TVs that have it so there that's the closest

01:12:48.220 --> 01:12:56.060
thing I can think of yeah the JVC x I ah was the one there it is and Rama said

01:12:56.060 --> 01:13:01.620
that he had a sharp TV ness but you know also Nintendo's licensed out you know to

01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:05.900
sharp for the twin Famicom you know the one that had the the built-in right

01:13:05.900 --> 01:13:10.620
business yeah I'm the built-in business I don't know what I'm saying lots of pun

01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:15.660
sorry I was just to say lots of puns about Q in chat rage nator in chat

01:13:15.660 --> 01:13:20.100
saying Q is a good antagonist in Star Trek the next generation as well and

01:13:20.100 --> 01:13:23.220
then that led to a bunch of Star Trek jokes there Bobby Blackwell says I would

01:13:23.220 --> 01:13:27.100
have bought a Q if it had come to the US vid power talking about they also made a

01:13:27.100 --> 01:13:31.220
Panasonic branded GameCube controller to go with the Q it was all from our chat

listening on the podcast feed whenever you want throughout the week appreciate

01:14:25.860 --> 01:14:28.780
that too hope you guys are having a good week whatever it is you're doing can't

01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:31.980
believe it's already October any Halloween plans I guess we have to start

01:14:31.980 --> 01:14:39.580
planning for that um no I don't know do do late late late 30s and 40 something's

01:14:39.580 --> 01:14:43.580
do things for Halloween anymore I might be doing like a charity thing oh that's

01:14:43.580 --> 01:14:47.900
great okay that's that's a good use of time good like I don't know yeah well

01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:52.060
maybe somebody that needs to have a charity event put on for them is Yoshi

01:14:52.060 --> 01:14:55.460
because apparently I don't know if you heard about it this week but there was a

01:14:55.460 --> 01:14:58.740
little bit of a thing going around the internet on some of the Twitter's and

01:14:58.740 --> 01:15:05.380
things like that that basically Mario is in fact in Super Super Mario world

01:15:05.380 --> 01:15:08.620
when you see Yoshi stick out his tongue you see Mario do a little thing that

01:15:08.620 --> 01:15:12.060
looks like this and that Mario enough for those obviously on the radio I'm

01:15:12.060 --> 01:15:14.900
kind of moving my fist down slowly but I think many of you know where I'm gonna

01:15:14.900 --> 01:15:17.660
go with this if you are reading something internet and it kind of always

01:15:17.660 --> 01:15:23.340
looks like Mario's going like go but it turns out according to a recent

01:15:23.340 --> 01:15:28.420
interview on Nintendo's official site the developers the Takashi Seizuka and

01:15:28.420 --> 01:15:35.300
Shigefumi Hino talked about the creation of this game and says that they talked

01:15:35.300 --> 01:15:38.260
about this where they want Mario to ride something and so forth like kind of like

01:15:38.260 --> 01:15:41.100
a horse that was kind of like a crocodile and so forth and then said in

01:15:41.100 --> 01:15:43.580
the interview lots of people think that when Mario is pointing his finger

01:15:43.580 --> 01:15:47.740
forward he's saying go and Yoshi's tongue comes out however the setup I

01:15:47.740 --> 01:15:53.860
drew was that when Mario punches Yoshi in the head the characters tongue shoots

01:15:53.860 --> 01:15:59.180
out in surprise what's more there's an added bop sound however it seemed like

01:15:59.180 --> 01:16:04.500
people would say poor Yoshi so that's why it became that Mario is saying go so

01:16:04.500 --> 01:16:09.380
the original artwork for that is Mario hitting Yoshi on the back of the head

01:16:09.380 --> 01:16:14.580
that poor poor poor thing and that's why I think so many people are fans of Yoshi

01:16:14.580 --> 01:16:20.340
because he had to put up with Mario shit for so long so stop be in chat over at

01:16:20.340 --> 01:16:24.980
live.vognetware.com says hey Yoshi ain't no saint in the Japanese version he

01:16:24.980 --> 01:16:30.580
eats dolphins that's true there are those dolphin monsters or whatever you

01:16:30.580 --> 01:16:34.140
want to call them that Yoshi can eat that's true so dark soccer does this

01:16:34.140 --> 01:16:36.940
change your world to know that all this time you've been punching Yoshi in the

01:16:36.940 --> 01:16:42.060
back of the head I've been rocked well well I guess in a way I'm shook Rob you

01:16:42.060 --> 01:16:48.060
get are you shooketh I am shooketh huh I shook it's I guess if you think about

01:16:48.140 --> 01:16:50.980
when you kind of ride horses you kind of kick them a little bit like you know

01:16:50.980 --> 01:16:53.540
there's a way there's a way to it I mean you're not just like unless you're an

01:16:53.540 --> 01:16:57.060
asshole who wears spurs yeah yeah yeah I mean there's a there's a way to it but

01:16:57.060 --> 01:17:02.420
you you know but still it just it kind of looks like a donkey punch but I guess

01:17:02.420 --> 01:17:06.740
never mind I'm not gonna go there you can fill in the blanks let's get to some

01:17:06.740 --> 01:17:10.300
rapid-fire news and cover some other news going on in the gaming industry a

01:17:10.300 --> 01:17:15.140
little faster here talking about doom on the Nintendo switch and people wondering

01:17:15.140 --> 01:17:18.300
if because oh well if dooms gonna be on the switch does this mean motion

01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:22.220
controls coming to the game and the answer is no it will not be like

01:17:22.220 --> 01:17:25.460
Splatoon where there's motion control aiming there's just gonna be the

01:17:25.460 --> 01:17:30.020
traditional analog controls the game will not have Splatoon like controls so

01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:32.840
this really is just a straight-up port it doesn't sound like they're doing a

01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:36.300
lot of enhancements for the switch at least not that we know of who knows you

01:17:36.300 --> 01:17:39.700
know Bethesda may surprise us with like a bonus level or something I always said

01:17:39.700 --> 01:17:44.260
putting like maybe not so much now I think about it maybe not Samus I don't

01:17:44.300 --> 01:17:51.420
think Samus would work so well in a game like doom but Ridley would so maybe

01:17:51.420 --> 01:17:54.820
something else from the Metroid universe would show up in the game anyway

01:17:54.820 --> 01:17:58.420
something else that many people are playing on the Nintendo switch is Sonic

01:17:58.420 --> 01:18:02.060
Mania granted it's on a bunch of other systems as well but specifically with a

01:18:02.060 --> 01:18:06.380
Nintendo version there is a home button issue when suspending the game so the

01:18:06.380 --> 01:18:11.020
good news is that whole feature whatever not feature of a bug is actually being

01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:16.260
addressed a patch is gonna be rolling out soon they haven't said when but soon

01:18:16.260 --> 01:18:19.540
I think it might be out by now because that was a tweet on September 25th so

01:18:19.540 --> 01:18:23.860
surely it probably came out in this past week so you can check that out so there

01:18:23.860 --> 01:18:26.540
you go how about you dark soccer what do you have for us there's going to be a

01:21:20.120 --> 01:21:25.640
after over at live dog network calm it's lady Layton that's why it's not

01:21:25.640 --> 01:21:29.120
professor Layton it's lady Layton in this game why can't she be a professor

01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:35.120
well she just doesn't happen to be in this case I guess seriously she's a lady

01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:39.200
in this game these can be smart no I mean that of course ladies can be smart

01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:43.720
but maybe that's very dear they that's her official title I am hurt in my like

01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:52.240
Lady Gaga I am hurt in my heart this is just Gaga's adventure all right I'm

01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:54.580
hurt maybe she just doesn't have a degree

01:21:54.580 --> 01:21:59.000

01:22:54.320 --> 01:23:00.640
3ds this week but I do see those new systems mxc coming to the rescue on the

01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:06.680
chatter about Lady Layton she's a detective so detectives don't get titles

01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:15.640
I guess she's a lady Layton is a private dick that's what it is do you

01:23:15.640 --> 01:23:27.080
like how I crack myself up with that dark saga they have this doll scene

01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:32.440
figure on here where he's like in the child pose and yoga mm-hmm with his arms

01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:36.920
like all the way across the room and I know it's the child pose because I did

01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:42.320
yoga mm-hmm but it's so weird so you're the authority on all things yoga okay

01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:47.040
apparently everyone's in this pose and they have a key change trap coming out

01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:52.600
of their ass what they get cooler figures in Japan than we do here that's

01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:59.400
what their cell phone character things things but I was like the fuck is this

01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:02.960
why do they have ropes coming out of their ass maybe they're into that I

01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:08.840
don't know the more you know we're gonna go to the mail bag over at participate

01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:15.040
at orange lounge radio.com where every week dark Sakura opens up the mail bag

01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:21.280
and finds jack shit nothing you guys didn't email us this week jack shit

01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:24.480
that's okay we're not if we had a few spam emails at least the spammers love

01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:28.880
us a little spam can eat jack shit too but if you want to send us an email

01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:32.280
maybe we need lady Layton to find out what happened at the case of the missing

01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:40.920
emails you know what what part participate at orange lounge radio.com if

01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:46.920

enough okay it is hard work to be as amazing as I am and to be cuter than

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:57.560
Loki Bobby Blackwell is asking if I check the regular mailbag account I

01:24:57.600 --> 01:25:01.520
don't I think those emails bounce I don't think and I fix the website so if

01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:07.040
you send something to the website it goes to the right email now so mailbag

01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:09.720
and orange on traders shouldn't come through at all I think those bounce now

01:25:09.720 --> 01:25:14.480
that was our old old old email address if I do need to go in there and check it

01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:20.320
I don't know how so anyway let's move on with some more news we're gonna start

01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:24.480
off talking about the Atari box that's right more information was announced on

01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:27.640
the Atari box this week and I don't know about you dark Sakura I'm not

01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:31.960
feeling this the Atari box is going to be running Linux it'll be out which is

01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:35.120
fine that's not that's not the part about me it's gonna be on an AMD chip

01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:40.320
it's gonna cost two hundred and fifty dollars yeah so the Atari box will be

01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:44.400
running on Linux with an AMD processor it'll be between 250 to 300 dollars

01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:48.120
Atari box creator and general manager I'm gonna totally mispronounce his name

01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:53.120
and I apologize fair gal Mac said that the Atari is going to be doing a

01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:58.040
crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo to launch the Atari box in the spring of

01:25:58.040 --> 01:26:03.860
2018 the Atari box is gonna launch with a back catalog of classic games so the

01:26:03.860 --> 01:26:08.080
box will make people hopefully you know want to play stuff that in past as you

01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:11.040
know the Super Nintendo classic and stuff is done well with this but also

01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:16.480
going to run independent games like minecraft air char and Terraria and the

01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:20.680
things that people want to do today you will also be able to do streaming run

01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:25.240
apps around the rows the web play music because this is basically a PC or a

01:26:25.240 --> 01:26:30.640
Raspberry Pi a little stronger though but in an Atari box feedback from fans

01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:36.240
on things like content colors and so forth will come into play on this so you

01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:40.880
can look forward to that if you want to fund this on Indiegogo here's my problem

01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:44.680
with this whole thing is that as much as they want to do the whole classic

01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:49.600
nostalgia thing you guys know those flashback consoles that are out there's

01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:54.120
already an Atari flashback console that I think is 60 or $70 I think there's

01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:57.040
several models they're up to I don't know if you know this Jamie have you

01:26:57.040 --> 01:27:01.160
seen those Atari flashback things before yeah I think I have one like in a drawer

01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:04.640
somewhere they're fine they get the job done they're basically like the NES

01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:08.480
classics basically but for you know sorry they're up to eight so this year

01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:12.520
is the Atari flashback 8 do you know how many Atari cartridges we have laying

01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:16.160
around Oh God well there were so many games right so that's why the whole

01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:21.520
thing lived for like ever yeah no what's hardy Atari party next year by the way

01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:27.360
oh really yeah it's tragic that is sad I'm sad but anyway in my heart you can

01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:31.080
have an Atari party where it whenever you want if you have well if you have

01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:34.760
all the real stuff or a flashback 8 is what they're up to now the new thing

01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:39.640
they added this year Activision finally let them put things like kaboom and

01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:43.320
pitfall I think is in there and hero and some of the Activision games which

01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:46.960
really were like some of the biggest titles on the 2600 were old-school

01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:51.040
Activision and yes that same Activision that's around today that owns Blizzard I

01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:55.520
mean they got their start really in the 2600 era do you remember why Activision

01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:59.000
got so popular and why so many people went to go make games for Activision

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:03.320
because it was a bunch of Atari people that left yeah because Activision would

01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:06.880
properly credit their developers yeah there's that because when pitfall was

01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:13.080
made it was David Crane's pitfall remember also oh crap what was it no it

01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:18.800
was EA that used to do the album artwork oh and have the pictures of the

01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:22.000
developers inside like they were abandoned everything that was cool yeah

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:27.880
so I guess no wonder they're in the same bed now yeah maybe act F points out

01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:30.560
there's also a gold version of the flashback yeah that's the one drawback

01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:34.560
is that there's like there's a flashback 8 there's a flashback 8 Activision

01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:37.720
Edition there's a flashback 8 gold edition and like all of them have like

01:28:37.720 --> 01:28:40.480
slightly different games on them and I don't know if it's like a gotta collect

01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:44.760
them all type of thing but that part's kind of annoying just have one with all

01:28:44.760 --> 01:28:49.760
the fucking games on it cuz we know that like you can fit every Atari 2600 game

01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:57.200
like ever made on like one of those older floppy disks from the 1990s like

01:28:57.200 --> 01:29:01.800
seriously Atari games are not that big they were what 4 kilobytes 8 kilobytes

01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:05.800
yeah maybe the biggest ones ever were like 32 kilobytes and that's pushing it

01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:09.240
I don't even know if they ever got that big I don't think so so you take

01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:13.160
hundreds of those and you can you're not even gonna hardly fill up an old disk

01:29:13.160 --> 01:29:17.240
like that actually I'd like to point this out to kind of as a side note that's

01:29:17.240 --> 01:29:25.200
a side note right for people who want to see have an idea of what old arcade

01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:31.040
games look like the Atari arcade games there is a special I saw on it was

01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:34.920
YouTube or something maybe maybe Netflix but it was about Steve Jobs when he

01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:39.160
worked for Atari oh yeah cuz breakout was a Steve Jobs thing right I think

01:29:39.160 --> 01:29:44.000
him and was all right that's where they kind of met yeah but well they had

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:48.400
already met before that but it was like the band's first album let's say that

01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:52.280
but the thing is that they talk about how many chips and how much money each

01:29:52.280 --> 01:29:57.160
chip took to make an arcade game and then later on you have then when you

01:29:57.160 --> 01:30:01.000
talk to the developers of some of the home versions of these games and taking

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:05.160
you know the arcade game and trying to reprogram and compress it into such a

01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:09.080
smaller package I mean no wonder pac-man was kind of crap oh yeah it's

01:30:09.080 --> 01:30:13.240
the whole reason why pac-man was crap the developer of pac-man wanted a larger

01:30:13.240 --> 01:30:17.080
cartridge for that game and Atari said no and that's why pac-man could only

01:30:17.080 --> 01:30:25.480
draw one goes to frame why I was sweaty balls anyway so anyway here's the thing

01:30:25.480 --> 01:30:28.220
with you try boss I don't want to be a hater I want to see Atari succeed

01:30:28.220 --> 01:30:32.600
believe it or not I'm rooting for you but Atari has to figure out what's its

01:30:32.600 --> 01:30:38.920
niche because the problem is I can fucking play Minecraft and Terraria on

01:30:38.920 --> 01:30:44.960
fucking Xbox 360 at this point which is gonna be way cheaper than $250 fucking a

01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:50.800
Xbox one s aren't those down to like 200 bucks at this point same thing with

01:30:50.800 --> 01:30:56.160
PlayStation 4's like the entry models those are getting cheap like and if

01:30:56.160 --> 01:31:01.040
those are gonna be cheaper than an Atari box Atari needs to find its niche and

01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:06.000
the classic game archive on Atari somebody else with the license beat you

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:11.640
to it guys so you got to figure out how to strengthen that now how about just

01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:17.420
throwing it out there if you really want to milk the moustache nostalgia figure

01:31:17.420 --> 01:31:20.280
out something different you can do with those classic classic games that the

01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:25.520
flashback console can't do you can have a pure emulation mode fine but what

01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:32.160
about something like here I go you ready Xbox 360 game room where you had

01:31:32.160 --> 01:31:38.000
the leaderboards the videos you could play online with somebody else now

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:41.720
you're milking that classic arcade library with something a little extra

01:31:41.720 --> 01:31:46.040
that doesn't exist on the flashback console that might appeal to some people

01:31:46.040 --> 01:31:50.480
you know that's a start but again that price is still pretty high I think you

01:31:50.480 --> 01:31:53.560
know Atari box is really gonna have to figure out like what's its niche what

01:31:53.560 --> 01:31:57.520
can what's it really gonna be able to do they can't already be done by a

01:31:57.520 --> 01:32:00.680
device that many people already have in their living room that would be the

01:32:00.680 --> 01:32:05.760
audience for this sort of thing that's sort of my my take on that oh and dark

01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:10.480
Tetsuya points out I even forgot about this those PlayStation 4 and Xbox one

01:32:10.480 --> 01:32:14.240
collections there's already two volumes of those you're right there's already

01:32:14.240 --> 01:32:19.080
Atari collections on PlayStation 4 and Xbox one so you can even play old Atari

01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:26.680
games already on Xbox one so Atari box figure out how you're better than Xbox

01:32:26.680 --> 01:32:33.440
one okay Rama points out Xbox one s is between 249 and 299 okay fair same price

01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:39.000
as what Atari box is looking at so how are you gonna be better than Xbox Atari

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:43.000
or what are you gonna give that Xbox can't that's the only way this sorry

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:48.280
Atari your heyday is over is the only way it's gonna work yep good luck I hope

01:32:48.600 --> 01:32:53.200
you can figure it out all right let's move on with something else dark soccer

01:32:53.200 --> 01:32:59.080
well this is the ultimate of splat fest in the first one I actually give a shit

01:32:59.080 --> 01:33:06.040
about kind of literally Nintendo of Europe has announced the next date in

01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:11.480
time for their next splat fest in Splatoon 2 it's the first full week of

01:33:11.480 --> 01:33:18.240
October and it asks a question that is relevant to my interests which way

01:33:18.240 --> 01:33:23.000
should your toilet paper go over or under it goes under its team front roll

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:30.240
if it's under its back roll back roll I know right I was thinking I'm sorry my

01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:34.040
favorite thing this is this was my proud Twitter moment I have a lot of Twitter

01:33:34.040 --> 01:33:37.600
moments where I'm like shaking my head this is the worst dumpster fire of an

01:33:37.640 --> 01:33:42.440
internet website but a rare proud Twitter moment came on the announcement

01:33:42.440 --> 01:33:46.440
post for this that Nintendo made on Twitter there were so many replies with

01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:52.000
the Alyssa Edwards gif going back rolls and I was like Twitter I'm proud of you

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:56.840
in this particular moment so there you go so anyway it starts off on October

01:33:56.840 --> 01:34:04.800
7th and it will run for a full 24 hours but of course we know that the right way

01:34:04.800 --> 01:34:11.440
to do it is front roll this is one of those things where I just I don't care

01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:16.360
and not like I understand this is a very controversial thing I just I feel like I

01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:20.640
don't have a horse in this race that's this what it is like I'm not I don't

01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:24.960
care if the paper is front or back I really don't I really don't I just care

01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:32.040
if it's three-ply but if you do it the wrong way you're wrong you're wrong and

01:34:32.040 --> 01:34:36.800
you should feel sad have they said if they're doing this in America yet I'm

01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:39.920
trying to see if no I haven't seen anything about the u.s. yeah I'm looking

01:34:39.920 --> 01:34:43.760
I'm looking at the wiki and I don't see it but I don't see the Europe one listed

01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:46.880
there either so I'm wondering if one of our Splatoon fans in chat over at

01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:51.280
live.vognetwork.com knows the answer come on no Gus and chat says leave it to

01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:57.240
Europe to tackle the real issues guys you don't chat says do you ever look at

01:34:57.240 --> 01:35:02.240
an adding machine the paper is back roll yeah but if you look at the patent

01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:09.520
for toilet paper it goes over oh god here we go let's see act it's also gif

01:35:09.520 --> 01:35:14.640
act theft and chat points out Japan's new Splatfest is stamina versus power

01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:19.520
that one's interesting but it's not like the types of things that divorces are

01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:25.120
made on like this Splatfest it's no you know what my divorce would be huh

01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:34.000
god damn it close the lid I'm taking the cat and moving to Japan bye no really

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:38.040
and marrying Margaret Cho no I'm done with that oh you don't mention her

01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:41.500
anymore that fantasy is over I apologize I'm not interested in her anymore okay

01:35:41.500 --> 01:35:48.040
you moved on I am interested in just living my moe moe dream in a little

01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:52.560
farmhouse okay in Japan work close enough to a train station that I can go

01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:58.040
to cool places let's see an act up just confirming that America has not gotten a

01:35:58.040 --> 01:36:01.640
new Splat that Splat fest yet so we don't have the official announcement

01:36:01.640 --> 01:36:06.440
however it is worth pointing out the first three for America in Europe were

01:36:06.440 --> 01:36:11.000
all the same so if this does change it would be the first one that is different

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:18.800
so we'll see what happens there all right there it is the world's most

01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:22.320
controversial Splat fest it's gonna get ugly I don't know what team to pick

01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:26.400
you know I just I don't care enough so I just I guess I'm gonna figure out what

01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:31.880
my friends pick and go with that so all right let's move on to another story

01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:39.000
what what don't be Alyssa no back rolls but I like Alyssa Edwards I like Alyssa

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:42.440
but no back rolls all right I'm gonna ask a drag queen what I should do all

01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:46.880
right I can arrange that right now you know one thing I think we can all agree

01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:51.880
you shouldn't do is buy Marvel vs. Capcom infinite ball I'm sorry I'm sorry

01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:55.720
it was a really low blow I'm sorry horrible transition well the bar isn't

01:36:55.720 --> 01:37:00.360
that high but here look here's the reality guys and I apologize to the MVC

01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:05.040
I fans out there but your games your game struggling a little bit that's the

01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:10.600
reality of the situation and that's here it is the sales charts are happening the

01:37:10.600 --> 01:37:14.640
Japanese charts came out this week some media create reported the numbers

01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:19.560
Marvel vs. Capcom infinite charted at number eight on PlayStation 4 with

01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:25.760
8,273 copies sold keep in mind the Xbox one is a non factor in Japan we don't

01:37:25.760 --> 01:37:30.400
even know how many it sold there but it wasn't many here's the thing so 8,000

01:37:30.400 --> 01:37:35.520
copies sold 8,000 and change Pokken tournament DX with the number one spot

01:37:35.520 --> 01:37:39.600
fifty three thousand three hundred ninety three copies that is a re-release

01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:44.760
of a Wii U game essentially now to be fair not everybody had the Wii U this is

01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:49.600
part of the reason why it's being re-released but still that is over what

01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:53.720
five I'm trying to do math fast five six times as many copies of Pokken

01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:59.400
tournament sold the Marvel vs. Capcom infinite in Japan also worth noting

01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:10.080
super Street Fighter 2 turbo HD remix for the switch 16,404 copies Street

01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:15.640
Fighter 2 outsold Marvel vs. Capcom infinite in Japan this week Street

01:38:15.640 --> 01:38:24.880
Fighter 2 what do you think of that Jamie I have nothing to say by the way

01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:30.960
in the UK kind of a similar story just so you know it's all poop it's it's not

01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:36.480
looking good there in the UK either it was mentioned in a tweet that ultra

01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:39.840
Street Fighter 2 for Nintendo switch had a better opening weekend than

01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:43.920
Marvel vs. Capcom infinite although I don't have the numbers over there as

01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:49.880
well so there it is act-def in chat over at live.vognetwork.com also points out

01:38:49.880 --> 01:38:54.680
Pokken tournament on the Wii U sold more than Street Fighter 5 on release so I'm

01:38:54.680 --> 01:38:58.560
not surprised that is true that was kind of a quote-unquote shock I guess you

01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:02.600
could say at that time although you know those that have played Pokken tournament

01:39:02.600 --> 01:39:05.680
I know many I know many folks that are really really into that such as act-def

01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:10.120
I have a copy and haven't played it yet it's it's good I have it on Wii U I'm a

01:39:10.120 --> 01:39:15.120
little hesitant to buy it again on switch I don't really I don't think I

01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:19.240
played it enough to justify the repurchase but I think if you didn't

01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:22.740
get it on Wii U and you like fighting games at all and you know especially

01:39:22.740 --> 01:39:26.080
Tekken which you know obviously this has a lot of Pokken it has a lot in common

01:39:26.080 --> 01:39:29.920
with it I think it's worth a look I do I I would recommend it on that basis but I

01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:33.000
don't know if I would want to rebuy it myself I'm just not that into it to do

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:38.840
that but there you go so anyway sorry to you Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite fans

01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:43.360
but I don't know I don't know Capcom kind of dug themselves a hole with this

01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:46.520
one and I don't know if it's the fact that the x-men aren't in it or just the

01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:49.800
art style at first was just sending a bad message when this game was first

01:39:49.800 --> 01:39:55.980
revealed or they just made a bad game but this is not bode well for Capcom and

01:39:55.980 --> 01:40:02.240
fighting games when they're their game from 1990 yes an updated remix and all

01:40:02.280 --> 01:40:07.080
that stuff yes yes but still a game from that long ago is doing better I don't

01:40:07.080 --> 01:40:11.000
know what that says anyway speaking of games from long ago Dark

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:21.000
Sakura hmm data East need I say more data East gave us bad dudes karate champ

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:32.060
kung fu master and burger time burger time yes yes well um there is a company

01:40:32.100 --> 01:40:41.780
called G mode that is working on a data East revival project so on their page

01:40:41.780 --> 01:40:46.620
that says are you looking for a data East license here's the answer G mode

01:40:46.620 --> 01:40:54.140
owns over 100 titles of deco data East franchises which includes let me just

01:40:54.140 --> 01:40:57.940
pick the ones that don't you know especially suck well I played fighters

01:40:57.940 --> 01:41:02.060
history a bit I kind of like that Joe and Mac lock and chase midnight

01:41:02.060 --> 01:41:07.900
resistance midnight resistance is a fucking good game Dark Lord burn and

01:41:07.900 --> 01:41:15.740
rubber bloody wolf bad dudes versus dragon ninja crude buster also known as

01:41:15.740 --> 01:41:25.020
two crude dudes so yeah they're working on trying to re-release some of the

01:41:25.020 --> 01:41:30.020
games and basically you can reach out to them on their webpage so that they

01:41:30.020 --> 01:41:36.780
can find a partner to get the games out so yay fighters history I still remember

01:41:36.780 --> 01:41:39.980
I care more about midnight resistance to be honest I still remember not that long

01:41:39.980 --> 01:41:43.820
ago there was like a burger time reimagining game that came out and it

01:41:43.820 --> 01:41:46.780
kind of came and went and I want to say it even got delisted at one point

01:41:46.780 --> 01:41:50.500
because I think the idea was they probably lost the license and maybe

01:41:50.500 --> 01:41:53.260
this kind of answers where it went is back in the pool for someone else to

01:41:53.260 --> 01:41:59.900
snatch up so someone snatched yes so maybe you know I don't know maybe some

01:41:59.900 --> 01:42:03.460
like really hardcore developer can pick up burger time and do like a burger time

01:42:03.460 --> 01:42:09.620
ultimate type of game we're like you murder those fucking eggs and bacon the

01:42:09.620 --> 01:42:16.420
chase you around the board be like zombie burger exactly all right from the

01:42:16.420 --> 01:42:23.180
developers of Bayonetta bring you burger time three all right I think this

01:42:23.180 --> 01:42:27.660
is really cool actually I I think this is this actually makes the Assassin's

01:42:27.660 --> 01:42:31.460
Creed series which is not something that I really ever super get into it's just

01:42:31.460 --> 01:42:35.220
you know again I don't have time obsessed though this I think this is

01:42:35.220 --> 01:42:38.580
great though is that what they're doing is that in the latest Assassin's Creed

01:42:38.580 --> 01:42:43.460
game Assassin's Creed origin a free origins update in 2018 is going to let

01:42:43.460 --> 01:42:48.020
you turn off combat story and challenges for an educational mode

01:42:48.020 --> 01:42:53.060
called discovery tour and it's because of the you know high-level graphics

01:42:53.060 --> 01:42:56.740
engine that these games provide this is gonna allow you to way to actually kind

01:42:56.740 --> 01:43:01.340
of explore ancient Egypt in an educational sort of sense and if you're

01:43:01.340 --> 01:43:04.940
kind of rolling your eyes at educational games well then don't fucking play it

01:43:04.940 --> 01:43:08.140
there's Assassin's Creed origin for you to play but I think this is kind of a

01:43:08.140 --> 01:43:13.240
really neat enhancement to an existing game to use the engine for something you

01:43:13.240 --> 01:43:16.640
know like if you like this game so much why don't you learn a little something

01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:22.440
about it well to point out and I mentioned this before when I was taking

01:43:22.440 --> 01:43:26.440
a little it was a few years ago when I was taking art history that my teacher

01:43:26.440 --> 01:43:32.760
used scenes from Assassin's Creed 2 no to illustrate Italy during the

01:43:32.760 --> 01:43:37.720
Renaissance because I mean some of the you know the the buildings around you

01:43:37.720 --> 01:43:42.080
know are of course severely damaged and things have been rebuilt and everything

01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:46.560
but it she said that you know from maps and pictures that was a fairly good

01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:52.720
likeness yeah of you know Italy around that time of Rome you know and so we had

01:43:52.720 --> 01:43:58.280
slides from Assassin's Creed 2 in our history that's cool and then we talked

01:43:58.280 --> 01:44:03.040
about how the de-medicis hated each other well anyway discovery mode is

01:44:03.040 --> 01:44:06.440
gonna be out in early 2018 it will not be there when the game releases on

01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:10.720
October 27th but you do have this to look forward to again in this mode

01:44:10.720 --> 01:44:14.080
you're gonna be able to explore ancient Egypt there will be no enemies running

01:44:14.080 --> 01:44:19.440
around they will also add a series of guided tours curated historians and

01:44:19.440 --> 01:44:22.400
Egyptologists will be available I guess in the game maybe they're getting some

01:44:22.400 --> 01:44:25.520
people to do some voicing and some writing for this stuff you can learn

01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:29.800
directly about pyramids Cleopatra mummification and more you can learn all

01:44:29.800 --> 01:44:33.880
about all the those big things that go with I would play that I think that's neat I

01:44:33.880 --> 01:44:37.320
think it's just kind of neat I would totally be down yeah so very cool

01:44:37.720 --> 01:44:42.040
props to the developers for doing that vidpower in chat says age of empires 2

01:44:42.040 --> 01:44:46.680
is my favorite education game you know I learned stuff from civilization you know

01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:49.680
as much as you might kind of laugh at that you know when you build wonders of

01:44:49.680 --> 01:44:53.640
the world you might learn you know they get do a little narration about why they

01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:56.600
built it and you know what it was for and all that stuff so you kind of learn

01:44:56.600 --> 01:45:01.200
you know I thought it was kind of cool all right just a few more stories for

01:45:01.200 --> 01:45:06.320
you guys dark Sakura one more story from you yeah well you know we've hit the

01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:15.320
30th anniversary for a Mega Man or Rockman and there was a phrase that was

01:45:15.320 --> 01:45:20.160
said by the producer of the Mega Man Legacy Collection to Kazuhiro Tsuchiya

01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:25.360
and as it was said I'm just gonna read the quote because it's very interesting

01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:31.640
I want to say the Capcom has not forgotten about Rockman the logo here is

01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:36.080
being put to good use that was the 30th anniversary logo Rockman's 30th

01:45:36.080 --> 01:45:40.120
anniversary is coming in December December please remember that date on

01:45:40.120 --> 01:45:44.680
behalf of Uchi and everyone here we are looking forward to it very much and hope

breath until December to find out and it better not be you know he's in another

01:46:03.720 --> 01:46:12.360
Street Fighter game December being the PlayStation experience in Vegas mm-hmm

01:46:12.360 --> 01:46:17.160
probably just getting another game or maybe a release just I mean it'd be nice

01:46:17.160 --> 01:46:21.720
if they did a new a new game not a fucking re-release we've had we've had

01:46:21.720 --> 01:46:25.480
plenty of fucking re-releases how many different new game I played make it to

01:46:25.480 --> 01:46:31.160
you yeah new game or get the fuck out you know what legends 3 or get out what

01:46:31.160 --> 01:46:36.120
if they did like you know how Megaman X was all the the big release now huh

01:46:36.120 --> 01:46:41.040
what if they did like a new type of Megaman platforming franchise Megaman Z

01:46:41.040 --> 01:46:47.000
why not make a man said mm-hmm why not do it I as long as the game's good

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:51.160
that's what I fucking care about we have the improvement upon Megaman EXE now we

01:46:51.160 --> 01:46:57.880

01:46:57.880 --> 01:47:02.680
windows executable all right one more story for you guys before we open up the

01:47:02.680 --> 01:47:07.080
skype line at orange lounge radio all one word and yes I saved the best for

01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:10.640
last tonight at least from my perspective very excited to hear about

01:47:10.640 --> 01:47:16.480
this there is going to be a Commodore 64 mini as if the NES classic and the Super

01:47:16.480 --> 01:47:20.240
NES classic wasn't enough now Jamie this one this one would be worth getting

01:47:20.240 --> 01:47:24.000
because most Commodore 64 is don't even fucking work anymore like it's very hard

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:28.160
to find one that actually works so I love this that they're actually doing

01:47:28.160 --> 01:47:32.320
this so they're actually going to be putting out a Commodore 64 mini it's

01:47:32.320 --> 01:47:36.960
going to be a fully licensed recreation of the 80s they call it console but it

01:47:36.960 --> 01:47:41.720
was kind of a computer it will connect via HDMI it will have a joystick even

01:47:41.720 --> 01:47:44.640
though there was no official joystick for Commodore 64 there were a few

01:47:44.640 --> 01:47:50.760
popular ones that I think this is based off of and there will be of course 64

01:47:50.880 --> 01:47:56.240
licensed games haha the console will be half the size of the original those

01:47:56.240 --> 01:48:00.080
things are huge some of the games to look forward to California games

01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:07.120
impossible mission another visitor stay a while stay forever

01:48:07.120 --> 01:48:10.520
you ever play that game with the bad synth in the beginning no I didn't but

01:48:10.520 --> 01:48:15.800
what was that school game that terrible school game or was it on Amiga the

01:48:15.800 --> 01:48:19.400
school game I don't know there's a lot of like educational game or like out of

01:48:19.480 --> 01:48:23.920
school you were in a school maybe it was on Amiga and maybe maybe I really like

01:48:23.920 --> 01:48:28.720
this art of art game where was I speedball to brutal deluxe paragroid you

01:48:28.720 --> 01:48:33.680
can look at more information over at VC 64.com slash games you can actually look

01:48:33.680 --> 01:48:38.240
at all the games in it including and this is kind of funny chips challenges

01:48:38.240 --> 01:48:41.840
in this I know the guy that made this game actually so I kind of want to bring

01:48:41.840 --> 01:48:44.540
he lives here locally so I kind of want to bring him on OLR to talk about this

01:48:44.540 --> 01:48:48.920
maybe I I want to know if he even knows this is being made he may or may not I

01:48:48.960 --> 01:48:53.760
don't know impossible mission 2 is gonna be in there as well which is the less

01:48:53.760 --> 01:48:57.640
noteworthy sequel Monty on the run that was a huge game if you were kind of into

01:48:57.640 --> 01:49:01.720
games back then anyway there's some good picks in here I'm cyber annoyed those

01:49:01.720 --> 01:49:05.400
games were really big on Commodore 64 you know last ninjas missing and some

01:49:05.400 --> 01:49:09.820
other stuff but you know I think there were only so many licenses they could

01:49:09.820 --> 01:49:14.960
get they couldn't get things like Donkey Kong's c64 port and things like that but

01:49:14.960 --> 01:49:18.120
this is this is to be a pretty good selection I'm very interested to look

01:49:18.120 --> 01:49:25.760
for to see it here so anyway I'm looking in chat over at live dot vog network

01:49:25.760 --> 01:49:29.360
calm black wolf actually has an answer for you school days maybe and that's it

01:49:29.360 --> 01:49:32.840
you said yes school days that was it because I remember the classrooms were

01:49:32.840 --> 01:49:37.080
yellow Wow Wow good job Bobby all right it was for the spectrum that's what I

01:49:37.080 --> 01:49:41.920
was thinking of other things that are available on this mini classic Commodore

01:49:41.920 --> 01:49:47.720
64 pics pixel filter options save game functions and the ability to use a USB

01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:53.000
keyboard no word though if it has the full Commodore 64 shell in it like where

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:56.240
you could launch into basic and maybe program your own thing I don't know if

01:49:56.240 --> 01:49:59.680
it's gonna go that far but that would be really rad if it did I'm sure somebody

01:49:59.680 --> 01:50:04.800
would hack it to do that it will be out in early 2018 and it will go for sixty

01:50:04.800 --> 01:50:11.120
nine ninety nine euros because it's not coming out in the states it's coming out

01:50:11.120 --> 01:50:17.300
overseas of course not yeah so there it is it's not gonna be coming out here

01:50:17.300 --> 01:50:20.940
it's coming out overseas I hope they will find a way to release it here I

01:50:20.940 --> 01:50:25.460
understand that Commodore 64 was huge overseas especially you know in the UK

01:50:25.460 --> 01:50:29.020
and stuff but I have a big place in my heart for it here so I really hope they

01:50:29.020 --> 01:50:32.660
find a way to put it out here it's being developed by retro games not the same

01:50:32.660 --> 01:50:38.180
company as retro computers who are making the Sinclair Vega Plus retro

01:50:38.180 --> 01:50:44.620
games did the 64 and they're working with kosh media who owns deep silver to

01:50:44.620 --> 01:50:48.740
distribute the console so that's pretty exciting yeah I agree Tiger Khan chat

01:50:48.740 --> 01:50:52.780
says you could import it it'll cost more yeah I probably could I mean hopefully

01:50:52.780 --> 01:50:57.240
these things won't have the scarcity problems that consoles over here have

01:50:57.240 --> 01:51:00.900
had with Nintendo stuff and I can just ask one of my friends over there to go

01:51:00.900 --> 01:51:03.700
into a shop and get me one like you know send them money or whatever and then

01:51:03.700 --> 01:51:08.580

I didn't want to disclose that myself on the show that's your business well well

01:55:38.040 --> 01:55:42.480
feel free you probably can do it a little bit more successfully than I can

01:55:42.480 --> 01:55:46.800
so I my understanding is you went to the hospital over some heart issues to put

01:55:46.800 --> 01:55:56.360
it briefly right correctly yeah yeah but anyway yeah it's basically served as a

01:55:56.360 --> 01:56:04.160
wake-up call for me yeah as a result I you know decided to go all yolo and

01:56:04.200 --> 01:56:12.040
decided to grow a pair and said you know what the fuck no proposed you know so

01:57:27.400 --> 01:57:31.120
we're happy for him here at orange lounge radio speaking of fam I think

01:57:31.120 --> 01:57:33.840
we're getting another call on the line right now connecting so let's check in

01:57:33.840 --> 01:57:39.560
hi you're on orange launch radio who's this it's the ringtone I thought I

01:57:39.560 --> 01:57:42.760
should kind of have that as a real tone on my phone you probably could get it

01:57:42.760 --> 01:57:45.200
y'all you probably just need a Windows phone it's alright I think it's

01:57:45.200 --> 01:57:49.720
connected this time you shut your poor mouth even Bill Gates I think uses

01:57:49.720 --> 01:57:52.600
nature all right no wait no look we got a caller on the line hi you're on

01:57:52.600 --> 01:57:56.880
orange launch radio who's this it's Ron man I'm kind of speechless right now

01:57:56.920 --> 01:58:03.240
because I heard somebody trash-talking a Windows phone yes keep in mind I don't

01:58:03.240 --> 01:58:06.440
like any phone that isn't an iPhone cuz I only buy good stuff she's a she's a

01:58:06.440 --> 01:58:10.000
fangirl oh yeah that I know it doesn't help the

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:14.600
fact that at work I have an iPhone and I'm sitting here looking at it I want to

01:58:14.600 --> 01:58:19.480
build and make basic adjustments where I can do a Windows mobile and Android and

01:58:19.480 --> 01:58:23.320
a friend was like oh yes swipe from the bottom I threw the phone across the room

01:58:23.320 --> 01:58:28.680
and said I quit for the whole damn day I did it's bad enough I want to make a

01:58:28.680 --> 01:58:33.280
ringtone create a phone to call ringtones drop the song in the system

01:58:33.280 --> 01:58:39.300
will see it iPhone you gotta use iTunes go through iTunes I still can't do it go

01:58:39.300 --> 01:58:43.900
dig it around found a program that is for trial where I just want one song as

01:58:43.900 --> 01:58:52.720
my ringtone and that's it it took me five minutes tops yeah well it shouldn't

01:58:53.400 --> 01:58:57.960
by just creating a folder on the phone itself it should automatically pick it

01:58:57.960 --> 01:59:02.080
up I shouldn't need special software to do it and I'm just like all right all

01:59:02.080 --> 01:59:05.640
right we didn't easy we didn't we didn't you I know your intention was not to

01:59:05.640 --> 01:59:09.120
call in to talk about cell phones so what's on your mind tonight buddy was it

01:59:09.120 --> 01:59:16.480
a couple of things um one I'm shook about this Atari box pardon me but I'm

01:59:16.480 --> 01:59:21.880
summoning my inner techno nerd rage and some of Loki's rage you mean to tell me

01:59:21.920 --> 01:59:28.440
an AMD powered console by Atari it's gonna run between two hundred and fifty

01:59:28.440 --> 01:59:36.920
and three hundred dollars no no I can understand if it was an Intel yes I can

01:59:36.920 --> 01:59:42.040
get that but unless they are opening up this console for not just for the

01:59:42.040 --> 01:59:47.640
classic games where you can develop games for the Atari box I'm sold brand

01:59:47.640 --> 01:59:52.880
new next-gen games retro games on an Atari box I'm so what it okay Ramit for

01:59:52.880 --> 01:59:56.320
what it's worth I do think that's part of what they want to do they want to do

01:59:56.320 --> 02:00:01.400
Minecraft Terraria they want to do those types of modern games it's not only

02:00:01.400 --> 02:00:06.280
classic games I think that's important to put out there well that's good I'm

02:00:06.280 --> 02:00:11.280
all for that because if this thing at this price is no more powerful than a

02:00:11.280 --> 02:00:15.200
game queue or a weed then you know what it's gonna stay right on the shelf the

02:00:15.240 --> 02:00:19.120
crowdfunding part of this kind of worries me too a dark to see it dark to

02:00:19.120 --> 02:00:23.400
see it brings up a damn good point sounds like the Ouya but probably more

02:00:23.400 --> 02:00:27.840
powerful but the okay let's yeah the I mean there's there's a few Ouya fans

02:00:27.840 --> 02:00:31.320
left but for the most part like everybody was mega hype about the Ouya

02:00:31.320 --> 02:00:35.800
and then like Ouya kind of who yucked out the door in like three months see

02:00:35.800 --> 02:00:40.440
but the difference I see on the software aspect is Ouya was powered by Android

02:00:40.440 --> 02:00:44.880
you can root and jump into that this is gonna be a pure Linux system where

02:00:44.880 --> 02:00:47.920
they're gonna be locking it down a little bit more it's gonna be they're

02:00:47.920 --> 02:00:51.160
gonna be able to do a little bit more with the hardware itself with the OS see

02:00:51.160 --> 02:00:55.720
our buddy our buddy Brad from pod culture jumped in I liked my Ouya he's

02:00:55.720 --> 02:01:00.480
but Brad I love you dude but you're the one Ouya fan that I know of out there

02:01:00.480 --> 02:01:04.320
but that no I mean that's cool that's cool but most people were kind of you

02:01:04.320 --> 02:01:12.040
know didn't really find the reason to get it eventually anyway you still with

02:01:12.040 --> 02:01:18.560
us mama yeah I'm still here I'm still here bro it's all good anything else in

02:01:18.560 --> 02:01:24.680
your mind to share super NES classic oh yes I understand everybody's like you

02:01:24.680 --> 02:01:29.040
know what F Nintendo I'm gonna go out and get the roms I'm gonna go out and

02:01:29.040 --> 02:01:33.460
emulate it I'm gonna go build my Raspberry Pi and all of this you know

02:01:33.460 --> 02:01:37.000
what I actually thought about doing it cuz I have a Raspberry Pi but I won't do

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:41.760
it because I am that lazy I will not sit here and like Bobby Blackpool said spend

02:01:41.800 --> 02:01:45.280
the whole afternoon putting it together no I ain't got time for that nobody got

02:01:45.280 --> 02:01:51.200
time for that but I will say there are games on this this system from my

02:01:51.200 --> 02:01:55.440
teenage years my childhood that I absolutely love and the main reason why

02:01:55.440 --> 02:02:00.600
I will put in the attempt to get one is because of Secret of Mana that game got

02:02:00.600 --> 02:02:07.200
me through a really hard time in my life I hope I have so many memories with

02:02:07.200 --> 02:02:12.200
Final Fantasy 3 you know and yes I know it's really six but to 15 year old Rob

02:02:12.200 --> 02:02:15.600
it was Final Fantasy 3 I have so many memories with that game like I can't

02:02:15.600 --> 02:02:20.840
even I I can't even bro I used to rent father see three from the video store

02:02:20.840 --> 02:02:24.640
and every time I returned I would re-rent it or if I couldn't re-rent it

02:02:24.640 --> 02:02:29.760
I'd hope and pray that I'd remember what the what the subcode was on the game side

02:02:29.760 --> 02:02:33.640
knew which one the rents I could pick up from my save game and hope and pray at

02:02:33.640 --> 02:02:41.080
some asshole didn't delete it I I I threw diva fits I did whatever chores

02:02:41.080 --> 02:02:45.240
had to be done I kissed ass I did everything it took to get Final Fantasy

02:02:45.240 --> 02:02:49.440
3 once I played it at a friend's house that's what I did to get my Super

02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:55.680
Nintendo period and then getting it for Christmas I was like yeah boy I love it

02:02:55.680 --> 02:03:01.200
yeah I'm you know I probably that's fine if people want to do the emulator thing

02:03:01.240 --> 02:03:06.280
then cool but I think there's there's some weird connection that some of us

02:03:06.280 --> 02:03:10.120
have with the whole fact that it is the official Nintendo product and it is you

02:03:10.120 --> 02:03:12.840
know the official channels there there's just something that just can't kind of

02:03:12.840 --> 02:03:16.040
you also know there's been a lot of quality checks for something like this

02:03:16.040 --> 02:03:19.960
that maybe haven't happened on the whole emulator side that I think are somewhat

02:03:19.960 --> 02:03:23.840
important but you know I'm not gonna knock people that choose to do the

02:03:23.840 --> 02:03:29.280
emulator thing you know more fine it is what it is but just understand that

02:03:29.280 --> 02:03:33.560
there's people that want to do it this way too okay you know what you can go

02:03:33.560 --> 02:03:37.840
out and do all that you can actually buy a 3d printed Super Nintendo shell to put

02:03:37.840 --> 02:03:42.920
on your Raspberry Pi oh you can actually go that far you know you know let's

02:03:42.920 --> 02:03:45.760
let's talk about this Rama let's talk about this is important I don't even

02:03:45.760 --> 02:03:50.440
really like Raspberry Pi like lemon meringue is superior no no no no it's

02:03:50.440 --> 02:03:54.680
all about peach cobbler my dude peach cobbler I okay versus Raspberry Pi I'm

02:03:54.680 --> 02:03:59.720

02:04:38.200 --> 02:04:42.000
the phone is actually ringing off the hook tonight because usually it's not

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:45.000
and I have to sit here and vamp for time now I just have to vamp for time because

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:49.760
this fucking tablet is slow to connect and that is definitely a goal before the

02:04:49.760 --> 02:04:53.120
end of the year is to upgrade see and now I hung up on him son of a bitch

02:04:53.520 --> 02:04:57.880
sorry buddy call back if you got this orange launch radio all one word on

02:04:57.880 --> 02:05:05.800
Skype it is my goal before the end of the year to have this replaced so and I

02:05:05.800 --> 02:05:09.280
when I say this I waved my hand at the studio stuff when I said this okay I

02:05:09.280 --> 02:05:12.360
think we are connected this time and I can say hi you're on orange launch radio

02:05:12.360 --> 02:05:18.760
who's this hi there's a deaf hey act F buddy how's it going not so great good

02:05:19.280 --> 02:05:25.240
to see you but I'm sorry it's not so great what's what's wrong well it's the

02:05:25.240 --> 02:05:33.320
next classic Amazon Amazon fucked you again didn't they you guessed it well I

02:05:33.320 --> 02:05:38.640
read Twitter but here's the thing here's the thing didn't didn't you learn after

02:05:38.640 --> 02:05:45.040
they wronged you last time one would think that one would think that that I

02:05:45.160 --> 02:05:50.080
would have learned the lesson that I would have to stay away from Amazon no

02:05:50.080 --> 02:05:54.320
look I'm teasing you a little bit I also understand I also understand that the

02:05:54.320 --> 02:05:58.300
Super Nintendo classics were so desirable that people kind of went to

02:05:58.300 --> 02:06:03.040
where they could get one so like I was able to get one at Best Buy which oh I

02:06:03.040 --> 02:06:08.200
never told the story about why what how I ran into trouble at Best Buy sorry

02:06:08.200 --> 02:06:10.720
deaf I'm gonna hijack your call for a minute but this is important problem all

02:06:10.760 --> 02:06:15.120
right thank you you know at least you can watch okay so Jamie get this so I

02:06:15.120 --> 02:06:19.880
pre-ordered my SNES classic on Best Buy when I was lucky and I found it on

02:06:19.880 --> 02:06:22.440
Twitter and I fell in that 20-minute window and I get the pre-order there

02:06:22.440 --> 02:06:27.480
right I go into Best Buy and they say what's your name and I give them my last

02:06:27.480 --> 02:06:30.240
name that you would see on my credit card in my driver's license right and

02:06:30.240 --> 02:06:35.760
they say we don't see that in the system and I'm like here we fucking go and I'm

02:06:35.760 --> 02:06:40.640
thinking in my mind I knew I knew this is too fucking easy I knew I knew

02:06:40.640 --> 02:06:45.280
it and it turns out they looked at my barcode and they're like we see you

02:06:45.280 --> 02:06:52.920
here it looks like this is for Rob Roberts and I'm going fuck so as you

02:06:52.920 --> 02:06:56.320
guys I'm sure know Rob Roberts yes that's my name here on Orange Launch

02:06:56.320 --> 02:07:00.400
Radio that's my internet persona name but that is my fake name like Lady Gaga

02:07:00.400 --> 02:07:04.280
uses a fake name right so that's just something I've always done since way

02:07:04.280 --> 02:07:07.920
back when when Travis first got me into this he said you want to have a fake

02:07:07.920 --> 02:07:13.520
name so that was it Rob Roberts right so I don't know how that ended up on my

02:07:13.520 --> 02:07:17.600
Best Buy thing because I'm thinking like what but I wouldn't have that would have

02:07:17.600 --> 02:07:20.720
it that's not the name on my credit card or that like how did that fucking get

02:07:20.720 --> 02:07:25.120
connected to Rob Roberts well I'm thinking it might have somehow got tied

02:07:25.120 --> 02:07:28.240
to my Facebook account because that's something you could do on Best Buy is

02:07:28.240 --> 02:07:32.360
tied to your Facebook account so anyway so they and they wouldn't let me pick it

02:07:32.360 --> 02:07:35.780
up because I didn't have any ID that showed that my name is Rob Roberts so

02:07:35.820 --> 02:07:39.620
first thing I learned this week I need fake ID that says that I'm Rob Roberts

02:07:39.620 --> 02:07:44.700
second thing is that but this and the the happy ending of the story because I

02:07:44.700 --> 02:07:49.980
did finally get it I had to actually go on to the website in the store and put

02:07:49.980 --> 02:07:55.700
Rob real last name as my pickup person to actually pick up the console and had

02:07:55.700 --> 02:07:58.920
to wait there for like 10 minutes while it went through the system and the new

02:07:58.920 --> 02:08:02.100
label printed out there and so you can actually see Jamie if you look at the

02:08:02.100 --> 02:08:08.140
side of the box on that label it says my real name to pick up for my stage

02:08:08.140 --> 02:08:12.580
name which is funny because again the critic yes she's making this face of I

02:08:12.580 --> 02:08:15.940
think it's also stupid that they have stickies on here yeah I don't want a

02:08:15.940 --> 02:08:19.500
little tack I I hope yeah they're low tack okay that's good cuz I didn't like

02:08:19.500 --> 02:08:22.780
that either cuz there's no shrink wrap I almost said saran wrap a shrink wrap on

02:08:22.780 --> 02:08:26.660
that anyway there you go there's my story I don't know how my fucking stage

02:08:26.660 --> 02:08:30.180
name got on my Best Buy order when again that's not the name on my credit card

02:08:30.220 --> 02:08:34.220
but I have I have had stuff stuff shipped to the house under my stage name

02:08:34.220 --> 02:08:39.060
but usually that's like game companies sending me the very rare review copy or

02:08:39.060 --> 02:08:42.380
things like that because they're not gonna know me as my real last name they

02:08:42.380 --> 02:08:47.780
know me as Rob Roberts which most people on the internet do but anyway that's my

02:08:47.780 --> 02:08:52.420
whole my whole issue so but unfortunately act theft I know my story

02:08:52.420 --> 02:08:56.660
had a happy ending I just was slightly inconvenienced but yours we don't have a

02:08:56.740 --> 02:09:04.140
happy ending yet do we no it's it it's terrible because and and I was going to

02:09:04.140 --> 02:09:10.620
a point with with with actually learning from Amazon and not ordering from them

02:09:10.620 --> 02:09:15.180
but at least the previous times that they happen with the switch is having

02:09:15.180 --> 02:09:20.020
with a splatoon it even happened with Pokken Pokken DX it even happened there

02:09:20.020 --> 02:09:26.180
but at least I got a confirmation from them that I would get it right now

02:09:26.420 --> 02:09:33.460
anyone and I mean anyone ordered from Amazon doesn't know shit about when it's

02:09:33.460 --> 02:09:38.900
going to get fulfilled what's really frustrating about that whole thing and

02:09:38.900 --> 02:09:43.060
where I would be at in that position is that meanwhile the fucking treasure

02:09:43.060 --> 02:09:47.460
trucks showed up from Amazon selling those things in different cities and

02:09:47.460 --> 02:09:51.540
then what did it show up on prime now as well I feel like it did in some places

02:09:51.540 --> 02:09:57.780
it didn't show up in prime now but it showed up on instant pickup which is

02:09:57.780 --> 02:10:04.860
different because they I think they like send it to a place like that something

02:10:04.860 --> 02:10:09.660
like a p.o. box oh you can pick up there so and this isn't and of course the

02:10:09.660 --> 02:10:12.820
first thing I was gonna ask is is the fact that you're in Mexico have a

02:10:12.820 --> 02:10:15.740
complication on this but you actually do you have you have these things delivered

02:10:15.740 --> 02:10:22.020
to a u.s. address right yeah I have a u.s. address that a friend and I share

02:10:22.020 --> 02:10:27.780
basically yeah yeah it's it's also like a p.o. box but it's for all type of mail

02:10:27.780 --> 02:10:36.220
yeah exactly but yeah I have to do that because if I try to buy a SNES mini here

02:10:36.220 --> 02:10:41.700
in Mexico it's around the end that's this is a retail price it's not even

02:10:41.700 --> 02:10:50.140
like a scalper price it's around $140 Wow yeah it's cheaper to rent the

02:10:50.140 --> 02:10:58.660
fucking p.o. box it's crazy way cheaper Wow and it's crazy yeah yeah Amazon

02:10:58.660 --> 02:11:03.060
really owes their customers a really fucking good explanation I mean here's

02:11:03.060 --> 02:11:09.660
the reality I can tell you right now the Amazon that ships the SNES mini to your

02:11:09.660 --> 02:11:13.940
house is not the same Amazon that runs those treasure trucks and that's the

02:11:13.940 --> 02:11:16.860
reality that that's why this is happening they are separate companies

02:11:16.860 --> 02:11:20.700
that are well they're separate branches of the organization running under the

02:11:20.700 --> 02:11:24.180
same name that doesn't think I'm not excusing it but that's what's happening

02:11:24.180 --> 02:11:29.260
but the problem is most people don't understand that and most people see it's

02:11:29.260 --> 02:11:33.700
Amazon and why the fuck is Amazon screwing me over while meanwhile the

02:11:33.700 --> 02:11:37.920
trucks are pulling into major metropolis cities where maybe I don't even relive

02:11:37.960 --> 02:11:42.480
and letting people buy these things that ought to be mine that I pre-ordered and

02:11:42.480 --> 02:11:49.400
yeah I'm not I'm not angry towards the the treasure trucks or instant pickup

02:11:49.400 --> 02:11:55.600
because people got got their SNES classic that way and I'm happy for them

02:11:55.600 --> 02:12:01.400
I'm really happy kind of salty but happy at the end because sure it's it's

02:12:01.400 --> 02:12:06.040
something they want it's not their fault Amazon it's not their fault yeah yeah

02:12:06.040 --> 02:12:11.760
and and the only thing I would want from Amazon right now is to explain this

02:12:11.760 --> 02:12:18.520
stuff yes because Amazon hasn't said a word about it that's the most

02:12:18.520 --> 02:12:23.920
frustrating part that Amazon that hasn't acknowledged this and all of the people

02:12:23.920 --> 02:12:31.720
all of us who stayed up late and I August 22nd at 1 30 a.m. I can't I

02:12:31.760 --> 02:12:39.320
remember exactly when I pre-ordered this thing we got screwed badly and we don't

02:12:39.320 --> 02:12:46.080
know even if we're gonna get a SNES classic soon and I really and it's like

02:12:46.080 --> 02:12:51.000
my god somebody I I am with you a hundred percent active somebody needs to

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:55.720
hold Amazon's feet to the fire on this so I don't know if I have journalist

02:12:55.720 --> 02:12:58.160
friends that listen to this show I know I have a couple but I don't know if

02:12:58.160 --> 02:13:01.480
they're listening to every episode every minute but if I have any journalist

02:13:01.480 --> 02:13:05.280
friends that have connections out there that are doing a story on this somebody

02:13:05.280 --> 02:13:09.320
needs to grill Amazon's PR department on how this happened and by the way

02:13:09.320 --> 02:13:14.580
something something to think about what else does Amazon own that's under the

02:13:14.580 --> 02:13:19.440
same umbrella with gaming twitch TV and one big thing that they're pushing on

02:13:19.440 --> 02:13:24.760
twitch right now is help us sell video games on twitch well I'm gonna ask this

02:13:24.760 --> 02:13:29.040
give twitch twitch if you want me to help you sell video games how are you

02:13:29.040 --> 02:13:31.680
gonna guarantee that you're actually gonna give them to people because you're

02:13:31.680 --> 02:13:34.440
all Amazon at the end of the day even though yes twitch is a different

02:13:34.440 --> 02:13:38.680
building than Amazon treasure truck and Amazon how are you gonna guarantee that

02:13:38.680 --> 02:13:42.600
the people I'm gonna push to buy things on and I say that as a twitch affiliate

02:13:42.600 --> 02:13:46.880
how are you going to make sure that the people that buy games on Amazon get them

02:13:46.880 --> 02:13:50.160
when they think they're gonna get them and when they're promised them that's

02:13:50.160 --> 02:13:55.480
exactly I would like to hear people asking of twitch yeah exactly there's

02:13:55.480 --> 02:13:59.520
there's tons of stuff going wrong with Amazon right now and especially with

02:13:59.520 --> 02:14:05.720
whether gaming pre-orders and all that stuff is and it's crazy that it isn't

02:14:05.720 --> 02:14:12.200
even like mentioned in any game journal or gaming blog out there because I have

02:14:12.200 --> 02:14:18.080
Church I'm I'm trying to look for answers to say to see if Amazon has said

02:14:18.080 --> 02:14:25.600
something that if anyone has already received their SNES classic but no we

02:14:25.600 --> 02:14:30.840
haven't seen anything and it's again frustrating because I ordered to one for

02:14:30.840 --> 02:14:35.560
me and one for a friend who lives in Mexico City mm-hmm and I really want

02:14:35.560 --> 02:14:41.200
that to have it right like as soon as possible because another friend of ours

02:14:41.200 --> 02:14:47.360
is going to Mexico City and I wouldn't have to pay for shipping yeah but if

02:14:47.360 --> 02:14:51.360
have to pay for shipping I would have to pay for importation fees the the

02:14:51.360 --> 02:14:58.880
shipping self and it's gonna be another 50 to more even more dollars that yeah

02:14:58.880 --> 02:15:02.640
we really don't want to spend well active for what it's worth I'm gonna

02:15:02.640 --> 02:15:07.120
cross my fingers and my toes tomorrow is Monday and if business things are gonna

02:15:07.120 --> 02:15:10.400
happen maybe Monday you'll get your answer you know it all went down on a

02:15:10.400 --> 02:15:14.280
Friday so maybe Monday Amazon will have some answers but if Amazon doesn't

02:15:14.400 --> 02:15:18.560
produce some answers on Monday then I would call on any of my folks with

02:15:18.560 --> 02:15:21.600
connections out there who do these stories where they get to interview

02:15:21.600 --> 02:15:25.320
Amazon or interview twitch ask these hard questions people like act deaf need

02:15:25.320 --> 02:15:29.680
you to ask these questions so all right my friend I'm gonna let you go and hope

02:15:29.680 --> 02:15:33.400
for the best for you okay hey thanks for having keep us posted we'll check in

02:15:33.400 --> 02:15:38.680
next week okay sure all right take care buddy all right I think that is gonna do

02:15:38.680 --> 02:15:42.160
it for the Skype line tonight I'm gonna definitely be watching his twitch to see

02:15:42.160 --> 02:15:46.160
if he gets that SNES classic or any of my friends that ordered on Amazon get

02:15:46.160 --> 02:15:50.960
their SNES classic but I think we're about to wrap up tonight's show that's

02:15:50.960 --> 02:15:53.680
it for another additional orange unless you had a last-minute story you wanna

02:15:53.680 --> 02:15:57.920
talk about our soccer I don't know I did find an interesting story about the in

02:15:57.920 --> 02:16:06.000
fact I actually reposted on my Jamie Summers fan page on Facebook if people

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:12.000
would like to maybe give it a like but I posted about the resurgence of a pinball

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:18.600
itself that after a sharp decline pinball has actually gone back into the

02:16:18.600 --> 02:16:25.000
rise with over 35,000 international tournaments so and then of course we

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:29.720
have more and more machines being released and I it makes it makes my dark

02:16:29.720 --> 02:16:37.760
heart a little bit brighter to know that that's happening any any thoughts on why

02:16:37.760 --> 02:16:41.520
like why pinball is it just maybe just kind of the whole like nostalgia thing

02:16:41.520 --> 02:16:45.880
like I think a good bit of it is nostalgia I think the other thing comes

02:16:45.880 --> 02:16:52.600
with it actually being some sort of you know a tactile sensation it's it's a

02:16:52.600 --> 02:16:56.940
game that you are more directly interacting with whether it's you know

02:16:56.940 --> 02:17:01.880
you know shaking the table you know without tilting it right or catching the

02:17:01.880 --> 02:17:07.040
ball and doing tricks with it it requires I think a lot a higher degree

02:17:07.040 --> 02:17:11.400
of skill but anyone can pick it up you know in some ways you know we make we

02:17:11.400 --> 02:17:15.920
make fun of the whole pachinko machine craze in Japan sometimes about oh

02:17:15.920 --> 02:17:18.920
Castlevania is gonna be a pachinko machine and all this stuff but in a way

02:17:18.920 --> 02:17:23.640
in a way pinball is kind of what we have instead of pachinko yeah in a way I mean

02:17:23.640 --> 02:17:27.080
right because it's it's similar they had their origins in the same place exactly

02:17:27.080 --> 02:17:30.280
they have their oranges in the same place so you know and I think if if

02:17:30.280 --> 02:17:35.080
Konami were to say we're gonna make a Castlevania pinball game most people

02:17:35.080 --> 02:17:39.320
would be like fucking rad yeah yeah talk to Stern Stern's the one making them

02:17:39.320 --> 02:17:46.340
which by the way our coin op has a has Lexi light speed which that one is

02:17:46.340 --> 02:17:52.360
supposed to be it's really a first of its type it's a supposed to be a modular

02:17:52.360 --> 02:18:01.920
table that has a video play field so the interactive elements are when it hits a

02:18:01.920 --> 02:18:08.520
target it changes on the the play field it's full video and it was really fun

02:18:08.520 --> 02:18:13.800
and it's supposed to be able to be modded into other pinball tables so all

02:18:13.800 --> 02:18:17.780
right well I think on that note then we're gonna wrap up another additional

02:18:17.780 --> 02:18:20.440

just when you're dealing with mitigating issues between a bunch of people and

02:19:04.640 --> 02:19:10.120
then other people decide that oh we need you to stop everything in your actual

02:19:10.120 --> 02:19:16.520
real life and work on stuff 3,000 miles away please don't do that to me I can't
