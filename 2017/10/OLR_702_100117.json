for answering our informal midna scooter than all of you so shut up all right so we're gonna get into some gaming news and talk about our weeks and all that good stuff let's kick it off let's kick off tonight's show talking about the Super Nintendo classic which is kind of what's dominating the gaming news cycle this week because I know a lot of folks were very much anticipating this and I think the big question out there was was Nintendo going to fuck this up on second thought I think I do have some of these other games so dark Sakura dark soccer now we talked a little bit about this at the tail end of Bobby Black Wolf tonight but you you're for now anyway passing on this Super Nintendo classic just because you and anybody who's listening to olr for a while kind of knows you and the hubby collect video games obsessively at least the old stuff especially well we did and now we kind of don't need to collect anything anymore well meaning that okay so when I say that like the retro stuff obsessively so you stopped at a certain point so maybe your collection when it comes to PlayStation 3 isn't as impressive but you stopped collecting like 10 years ago no was out no every game that they ever made except for we haven't really actively sought out anything unless if something was a super good deal yeah you know or you know it was well holy hell we're at a thrift store and someone is selling a Super Nintendo with Pocky and fucking rocky too do you know how much that game is by itself yeah it's crazy like 300 bucks yeah unboxed yeah and we got one for 50 bucks with a pile of other games and another fucking Super Nintendo because somebody didn't know what it was worth hello goodwill thank you yeah so but because okay but you built up this collection then essentially accident in the 90s in the early 2000s mostly in the early on yeah so and it doesn't all go bad they're all cartridges well they haven't rotted they yellow but they haven't rotten they have some disc rod on some laser discs but our cartridges are eternal so so you don't really have a need for this not really enough played Star Fox to have played the the fan excuse me hiccup fan translation hmm and it's fun it's okay I don't think I'd pay 80 bucks just for Star Fox too that's just one of those little like it's just a little like it's a little cute little cute little dot on the cupcake it's one of those little cinnamon hots okay oh but I'm looking over the lip I don't like fake cinnamon I'm looking over the list and I mean I'm really trying not to do the toot my own horn thing hmm but I truly believe like the only game on here that I'm not sure if I own other than of course Star Fox 2 because it no one owns a legit cartridge copy of it hello right um is I think we don't have Kirby superstar I think I do have Kirby's Dream Course that's funny because I have Kirby's Dream Course and my collection is nothing I think I have Kirby's Dream Course I think I don't have superstar which is a travesty I'm pretty sure we have Contra 3 somewhere so so all this SNES classic made you do is realize shit we need to find a copy of Kirby superstar pretty much I mean okay but let me let me ask you there's only one game on here I really don't care about let me ask you this and if you don't want to toot your own horn take yourself out of your shoes for a minute put yourself in my shoes now I played the Super Nintendo I love the Super Nintendo but I didn't build up the collection you did I kind of took a break from gaming in the early 2000s because that's when I was in college and I just I didn't really rediscover my love game to extra in college I know but I didn't really rediscover my love for gaming until you know I took a few year break and then like DDR kind of brought me back right and here we are you know all these years later but you know if if I don't have all those games but I have memories of playing these games in my friends houses do you see where this is more appealing to me I totally do yeah I know and keep in mind if I didn't have at least half of the games on here yeah hell yeah I'd be all kinds of hot for one okay and we do we've asked our our buddy you know hey you get another one in let us know yeah you know it'd be great to have but our nest classic is it's still sealed we have not opened it it is on a shelf on top of I want to say a stack of Genesis games and that's hilarious you know some people who still can't get one that now they're gonna hate you for that comment but no it's it's it's it also well you have to also look at the perspective it is a collectible item and sometimes you don't open collectibles you like you know there's some people don't open their amiibos that's stupid well my amiibos are actually no all my amiibos except for my Animal Crossing ones because I got all the Animal Crossing ones right right and I got all the the Kirby Planet Robobot ones but I was gonna say if I was in your shoes and I had the big impressive collection then I probably would pass on this you're right there wouldn't really be like what is there to drop 80 bucks on the only thing I could remotely think of is well a the cute I mean it is it's adorable the little thing is adorable the little Super Nintendo even though doesn't like the eject button doesn't really work but it's cute but the only thing I can think of is that like the the fact that it's HDMI native and doesn't have to be run through converters yeah that's cool I mean that's what we were talking about making it worthwhile for yeah because we can't play it on our 4k TV without there being significant lag a twist and see that was what we ran ran into when we did the NES marathon for I think Dan was doing it for Child's Play just you know games all day and I was trying to play the Guardian Legend and I was like fuck I don't remember my my what's the word I'm thinking my reaction time being this slow and it turns out there's like a one to two second delay using the converter and that just makes games like that practically unplayable you know but I mean if we did another one probably run it through though you know we we picked up a Vega for like 10 bucks at a thrift store an age ago mm-hmm and I'm sure well your ex-roommate had a Vega right oh the one I try to forget yes well sorry no it was the house for a while yeah I know I know money Melrose place yes yeah um but that was it's been great because it's really high def for what it is and we've been able to play on it so I mean it's just like do I want to sit on the couch and play or do I just want to go in the game room and sit on one of those chairs that Dan you know ripped out of old Honda Prelude to make his driving rig out of back in the day still the driving rig by the way but we still have the prelude seats on boxes let me get to some of the comments from our chat over at live dog vog network comm vid power feeling good about the SNES classic saying my friend and I played the SNES classic all day yesterday yummy miss nostalgia all day fuck consoles in our chat no tell me how you really feel says NES mini plus SNES mini equals $160 raspberry pi does both and is $35 and can do both get a man who can do both okay no man I think that's right I am an independent person who doesn't need a man but anyway look all that joking aside like and I I just I have to address this because it was a really funny article it was going around Twitter and Facebook this week I mean the whole like um you too can get a Raspberry Pi and never shut the fuck up about it and all that stuff like I I get that perspective of using the emulator it's a valid perspective if I couldn't get my hands on an SNES mini and I've said this on the show many times I would have been left with no other choice than to steal it and it would that would have been doing the Raspberry Pi option because I mean sugarcoat it all you want unless you own all those games you're putting on your ROMs you are or I see me putting on your Raspberry Pi you are engaging in I mean it's it's very it's very gray area and it's you know but but it is it's piracy I mean let's just put the word on it it's piracy but I would have done it too you're copying that floppy right but I would have done it too if I couldn't pick up one of these things but if Nintendo did not want me to have one but I will say this there's a few things to be said about the fact that it is official the fact that it is a cute little collectible that the little you know device itself is is great and it is an official Nintendo product and so forth like I all those things are you know appealing to me in a way just as a longtime gaming fan I want the stuff that's you know available by Nintendo now will I have to use a Raspberry Pi to play the stuff that I know Nintendo is never gonna put out on any type of like like let's say I want to play Pocky and Rocky 2 like that game is just never coming back that's why it's so you know so if I want to play that I'm gonna have to use Raspberry Pi I don't have another choice but you know for these games that you know were and I gotta say it's a pretty impressive list of games I told Dark Soccer I wanted to do a thing here at the top of the show where I said okay I want you to take three of those games and strike them and tell me what three games you'd put on it and Jimmy's like I can't do it no there's one on there I would get rid of well okay one which one it would be Contra 3 Contra 3 because it's not really the greatest Contra game right I would probably put say content to three on it okay well that's well or that's chance but Kirby's Avalanche okay three Kirby games Jamie three Kirby games fuck yeah why why not just a Kirby classic you know I wonder I wonder if this is where you know I haven't even got to the news store I want to read but I wonder if this is where Nintendo might go with this next like I know everybody's expecting an n64 classic but I'm gonna throw a different option out there maybe for 2018 Nintendo might look at doing a Mario classic and what it's gonna be it'll be like a little Mario head or some really cute little Mario collectible Kirby but and what will be built into it is gonna be like let's say some of the things are you know what you know what that SNES classic is missing that's a really big void in it Super Mario Brothers all-stars it's completely missing from that now all those games are in the NES classic but anyway they could do a Mario classic that has those Mario World Yoshi's Island yes I know all these things already exist but maybe they throw in a couple other the Mario side story stuff and then how about where's Mario everyone's favorite Mario is missing Mario is missing yeah whatever I do but then do Mario 64 is also going to be in it and I bet that would be thing and then they could do a Zelda classic that would have all the Zelda games and Ogrina of Time and maybe Majora's Mask as well that may be a direction Nintendo goes in that would be my prediction if I was at Nintendo and I was like what you know do we want to do an n64 classic I just an n64 classic would probably not have as many games on it I know it sounds really shady but if they if they can't get the third-party licensing to have shit like Goldeneye on it which I don't think they would be like I don't think they can get Goldeneye on it you know and some of the other stuff I don't I don't know if it's gonna be as must have lost the license for the likenesses in Goldeneye actually I think they've lost the licenses for the name mm-hmm I know there was a bunch of a bunch of stuff that went around oh why oh it's had some problems getting re-released but crap there was another I think that they'd have some trouble doing some of the n64 games unless well no they wouldn't because they'd probably have enough memory built in for instead of the expansion port but I don't see them going the route of doing an n64 classic but we'll see I feel like Nintendo is gonna why ride this wave another year one way or another so we'll see really they're riding on the coattails of Atari mm-hmm you know with the Atari flashback mm-hmm it's it's stuff that's already been done it's just finally they're like oh there's call for it let's do it all right well so to talk a little bit more specifically about what's going on in the news and the blogs about the SNES classic this week it sounds like overall the experience is going better for people and granted everybody's issue is different because like even I notice in chat over at live dog network calm we have everyone got a mini but me man which I think is break man so I think there are some people that are still frustrated I do hear Amazon made a big screw-up that messed some people over so I think some people are still salty about that and I acknowledge that I get that but it sounds like the big picture is a lot less people are salty this time there were salty about the NES classic and I think those that are salty now if if they want to still I mean some people may just say you know what fuck fuck this whole thing and bow out and that's fine but those that want to stick with it I think probably will end up with an SNES classic you know sooner rather than later so I kind of feel like the vibe out there is genuinely you know positive us gamer kind of did a little compilation compiling of all these different stories kind of looking at different boards and things like that and people overall were pretty much saying you know it was it was way better basically this time things things were doing better this time you know the lines were there but you know it was kind of manageable most people were able to get one if they showed up even you know an hour beforehand or what have you you didn't have to camp out all night although of course many people did especially at places like the official Nintendo store and some of that stuff so anyhow also I'm noticing in chat they're talking about how Mario is missing is really not that great of a game it's not it's edutainment it's for small children yeah I know it was it's uh it's the Donkey Kong jr. math of the Super Nintendo era it's like it's trying to be where in the world is Carmen Sandiego with Mario but that's actually a really good analogy and but but Carmen Sandiego you could type and you can't really do that on super yeah that's what makes it but you see what I mean though yeah it's meant to be secret you know education ooh do you want to talk a little bit here I know we've addressed it but you want to talk a little bit here about the Star Fox thing at the top of the list there oh yeah Star Fox um so the the ROMs already been dumped you knew how is this I mean I'm saying this tongue-in-cheek obviously it is news it made all the wires up there but I'm saying it tongue-in-cheek how is this news because hackers are gonna hack we all know that right it's it's we knew it was gonna happen right away how quickly did they get the the nest mini figured out oh before it was on shelves just like this pretty much thing somebody took one of those things home early that was in a store somewhere that had a connection and dumped it before the thing was even out well and also they got it extracted to a dev cart mm-hmm and they had an RGB modded SNES hooked up and also the dev cart they has is super FX to dev cart and got it running on a Super Nintendo so it works there's a video of it and everything so I am completely not surprised and you know the one thing I'm waiting for is to see now how much capacity for you know more games does it have on it how how how much longer until they figure out how to get more games loaded on it or create like a ROM loader or something like that so only a matter of time probably not too long I hear a lot of the technology in there is very similar to what already exists on the NES mini so I'm sure that I think they think they've already had some there's like a whole reddit dedicated to the hacking the Super Nintendo classic and I think they've already had some type of like limited success with it so probably I would say I don't know if I would go in and hack mine today but I'll give it a month or two for everything to kind of iron out and then we'll see I'm kind of torn on the issue because you know a do I really need to do that be do I want to you know quote unquote taint the collectible I guess for lack of better term by doing that to it so I don't know I'm gonna kind of just give it a couple months and see what I want to do but no and I I'll share the video with everyone in the chat room because it's just neat the guys shows the cartridge he has and everything and then loads up the game and it works on a Super Nintendo so hey Tiger claw and chat over at live dog network comm says sky but first try to beat every single game on the SNES mini before you do that you know it's funny I have good luck with Contra I've beaten a lot of them prior but yeah I mean I think it would be fun it would be if I'm sure I'm not the only one I'm sure I'm by far not the only one thinking this there's probably hundreds of people doing this but I thought it would be a fun little like streaming thing to actually stream beating you know all the games on there at least the ones that I can do you're right I don't know if I can do Contra 3 but I'll try I can try but some of those games are gonna take a while like you know don't forget guys things like Final Fantasy 3 6 I know but 3 in this case Final Fantasy 3 and Secret of Mana those games are hours and hours and hours those games are still long games just because they're retro did not suddenly make them faster you know unless you unless you're speedrunning them but I'm not a speedrunner that's not what I would do with them I would play them as if I was playing them for the first time I'm gonna have to check the date on this one because there's a I mean I know that beta 64 is done one on star yeah this is the old one I was hoping that beta 64 would do an updated video of Star Fox 2 you know now that we have a release of it but I don't know because I liked watching the old the old video all right I also learned something new yeah that the Super Nintendo in Australia looks like the Super Famicom oh does it that's the one the one in Europe looks like that too doesn't it yeah yeah same yeah I didn't know it until I didn't even realize it until I saw my friends I would I think those are cute and I wouldn't mind getting one of those but I think it's it's the exact same game lineup I think yeah I think so I think the one in Japan is different just like the NES classic had some different titles in it like for example I know let's see I'm actually pulling it up I know Legend of the Mystical Ninja was on the go him on going on you know and that that is on the Japanese one I'm actually trying to pull up to see what the changes were that they made okay so for our version Japan does not have earthbound Kirby's Dream Course Street Fighter 2 turbo Super Castlevania 4 and Super Punch-Out those are unique for us Japan does not have those but Japan has these five instead going on they have Super Street Fighter 2 the new challengers that's weird we got Street Fighter 2 turbo they got Super Street Fighter 2 that's kind of weird but that's how it worked Japan also got super soccer paneled upon and fire emblem mystery of the emblem those are pretty yeah epic though for I'm really surprised not get mother too and we have that I guess I don't know that it was as big of a deal yeah I guess though as far as RPGs go you're right it probably was that fire m1 was just like the way bigger deal whereas you know earthbound was pretty big here even though the Nintendo still continues to rob us of Earth Mother 3 earthbound to everyone call it so anyway all right hey we talked about games that aren't just Super Nintendo we do play other games too so let's before we get into the rest of this week's gaming news let's talk about how is your gaming week and the types of video games that you've been playing this week so dark soccer oh did you get to play some games well actually really the past two weeks you were here yeah um I well it's like I I mentioned before I bought clubhead haven't had a chance to start it yet but I'm really looking forward to that because that's the game I've been waiting for for a while um I I quit Wow a couple of weeks ago what else did I play I'm still playing idle pouring on my phone because it's actually ridiculously fun and how it's like all of the parts of an MMO without actually having to play it if that makes sense I mean you play it but you don't have to do the running around annoying part and you know your quests are kind of different so I'm also I'm still kind of playing me Tomo and Pokemon go I participated in a raid all by myself and it was my first raid ever and it was the one around the corner from Rob's house that I did on the way here did you it was it like a magic carp or something no it was a bay leaf okay so like one of the one stars that you can do by yourself and I caught him to good job with whatever that white ball is premier ball you know whatever it's white white balls at least it's not wrinkly your milky white balls yes okay um I also I got danganronpa v3 and I started it but I think I'm going to stream all the parts of it that I do so I will be playing it a lot more slowly than I wanted to but and I was thinking because I was I started it on a Wednesday because I started with the demo which I still need to finish the demo I'm not gonna do the demo trial I'm just gonna play it on my own but I'm gonna start with v3 I was supposed to do it on Wednesdays but I'm going to see gorillas on Wednesday oh shut up where at San Francisco oh it's gonna be fun cuz my friend Crystal got an extra ticket oh and I couldn't the same crystal I know yeah yes same crystal I know right yeah uh-huh um got got an extra ticket and so I was like hell yeah I want to go so we're like we're going like heck yeah awesome so I wanted to see gorillas for like 12 fucking years so it's happening boo yeah so and they do it just for people that are like isn't that a cartoon man they yes they do like the hologram they do the um to pocket Coachella thing right they know how they're doing it for this one oh really the one that they did last year was like they used to have like the big screen and everyone playing behind the screen Hatsune Miku it's like a Hatsune Miku if they do it if they do it hollow like that and then I get to see Damon Auburn in person I'm like oh so I'll be happy because I was also a big blur fan in the 90s but not to digress too much from the game thing I we got a pinball we got a pinball mm-hmm we got a medieval madness congrats dates the re-release it's got like the color LCD screen and all that and what the digital screen and it's got like the black trim on it it's I think one of the tournament editions but I kind of beat Dan on the game today like I don't beat Dan at pinball like ever and I beat him by like a million points today it was pretty fun and we're having to fix Star Trek so but yeah we have a medieval madness in our living room now fun the collection grows I'd like to go to Disneyland but Dan keeps buying pinball tables I'm just giving him a hard time I super I super love pinball and I really you know if they redid theater of magic oh heck yeah mm-hmm I I have like three or four the table is so fucking good sorry I want theater magic of the four that are on my list huh it would be theater magic huh it would be bright of pinbot 2.0 it's the one that's got the conversion in it that has like the extra modes and everything mm-hmm black rose the one with a cannon and everything and I'd really like a Big Bang bar but those are even the repros are expensive so I think you know I don't collect pinball machines yet wink but I think my dream list would be baby Pac-Man baby Pac-Man pinbot the original I used to have one and the theater magic I think that's on almost everybody's list magic is expensive now it's a great table though and probably ten grand for one magic is Scheherazade I think or what was the genius share what does that one the that went with a big lamp in the middle that spins I'll look it up I think it was though like magic of Scheherazade yeah something like that so that's and that that one I really like to Oh maybe Adams family Adams family is good but it is pricey it is well it's so like I know I'm naming a bunch of cliche tables but these are like these are my memories from you know many years ago and well don't forget people in California the Golden State pinball festivals coming up next year not all the way for next year I'll mark my count in Lodi Wow okay it was it we used to be Pinagogo in Dixon yeah and the owner of the event I think sold it or gave it to somebody else and so they moved to Lodi in an air-conditioned facility that doesn't have corn pollen in it thank you God for it's now like Golden State pinball Expo or something I'll get news for it and post it and our to see it points out in our chat room at live dog network calm surely they have pins it it's a bunch of pinball absolutely but Golden State pinball festival is pinball yeah exclusive yes all right anything else for your gaming week no all right I'll talk about my gaming week then I will I'll be a little I'm gonna do pinball too but I'll be a little less on it than dark soccer but I did play because it just came out this week pinball FX 3 just came out and so I downloaded it on Steam and if you didn't already know it imports a lot of the stuff that worked with pinball FX 2 I think some of the license stuff doesn't totally carry over but I mean like the Marvel stuff does the Star Wars stuff does there's a lot of it that does come over so that's pretty cool so I was you know playing some of those tables and so it's kind of like well what's different what's new about it well they have some more like competitive modes which I thought was cool is that you can do like a little tournament which was excuse me very similar to the Bethesda pinball app which some of those tables are in a separate app on iPhone and Android where you can kind of like play other people and if you beat their score you get season ranking points you're basically playing like a seasonal challenge type thing and I thought that was cool so I was playing a little bit of that so yeah I dabbled in but but the problem is I can't do every table in the season because I don't own all the tables so that's you know pinball FX if you didn't already know is free to play except you don't I don't know if it comes with any tables for free I think you can demo tables all of them for free but you have to actually purchase tables a la carte but one of the humble bundles a year or two ago had like 15 tables in one of the humble bundles and that's where I think I built my PC collection I have a pretty decent collection on PlayStation 4 as well but you know just from what I've collected over that era but thanks that humble bundle I have a ton on PC as well and Bobby Blackwolf and chat pointing out that sorcerers lair is free so there is one free one in there so that's pretty cool that they give you at least one and that is one of the tables that's in the tournament right now so you can even participate in the tournament just with the free tables that's pretty cool so I played a little bit of that I want to tell this story so I went I'm so tired today you guys because I took a trip yesterday to San Francisco and part of it was Rocky Horror related so I was up really late last night supporting the show over there but what we did earlier in the day when my pal JD who's been on the show before we took a trip over to Oakland and we actually went to the Museum of Art and Digital Entertainment which I never been to before I guess it's been around for like years and I not been over there but they were having their sixth anniversary special and JD found out about it on Facebook it was like Rob there's like a video game museum in Oakland I was like there is oh yeah I think I have heard of this and we just never fucking been so we went and it was cool like it's just um it's a lot of like it was basically okay dark Sakura imagine if your vault was the size of the house and you let strangers come in to play whatever games they wanted that was kind of the museum which I thought was kind of neat so but I was I was in problems but there's a part of me that's kind of like man what's the security like in this place because there's a lot of stuff that's not behind glass cases and I was like there's a lot of games on there they must have something that they don't they don't share the secrets with but yeah I had a good time when I went over and just you know looking at all the classic stuff and I did get my hands on something I did play even though there were quite a few people there I couldn't play everything but I did play and I know the first words out of Jamie's mouth watch are gonna be like why don't you just come over and play that at my house but the thing that I played was pac-man on a Atari 800 computer I don't have one really an Atari 800 okay by the way the game you're thinking of is tales of the Arabian Nights oh that's because Scheherazade was an RPG on the NES yes I can see how I get those two confused I love I knew Scheherazade okay tales of Arabian Nights that is it thank you for correcting me on that okay but anyway uh where was I so pack I we played pac-man on the Atari 800 because why not it was available and it was like hey this is old and it was actually it's it's a decent translation of pac-man believe it or not so yeah all right so yeah I had a good time at the museum so props to those guys over in Oakland they are located in Oakland at 3400 Broadway you can check out more information at the maid org I might reach out to them to see if we can get one of those guys on the show in the coming weeks to talk a little more about what it is they do over there because I thought it was pretty cool because one of the things I liked most about it was that I saw a lot of like people my age and their 30s late 30s bringing their kids and introducing their kids to old games so it's like you're gonna play pac-man the way I played pac-man I thought that was really cool you're gonna cry just like we did exactly so yeah I thought I thought that was really cool so props to those guys um as far as other stuff I don't know if I played a lot of other new stuff I guess two small things on Nintendo switch because they released a ton of stuff on Nintendo switch this week so I did pick up Mario Brothers in the arcade archives because you remember a couple weeks ago and Nintendo did that Nintendo direct and they mentioned that hey this arcade archives thing that's been all these neo geo games we're gonna expand that to Nintendo made arcade games from you know 83 and 84 in that era so Mario Brothers is the first one they put out and yes Mario Brothers has been out in several forms it was on the NES and then they it's it's in like it's in every frickin Mario advance they've done since then but nothing seems to recreate the original quite so well especially down to the sounds and the fact that the sound in that game was actually kind of garbage but that was the charm of it was that it was so garbage that the coin noises it's just like really like messed up but it's that's part of the charm of it it really took me back to being at the roller rink and playing arcade games and dating myself but what my roller rink game was right no I forget Frogger oh to the day that I can't play Frogger well unless I'm on roller skates my biggest one was spy hunter which always cracked me up because I had the pedal with roller skates exactly we had a stand-up pole position there but it was always broken um the Babalu in Dothan Alabama and then I also bought p-cross on the Nintendo switch I think it's called p-cross s is the actual name of it but I thought it's a cheap little game and it's one of those nice little games that's like oh I can pull the switch out while I'm like lying in bed and this is a good game to be able to play before I fall asleep but I need to stop I need to stop buying new games because it's fucking holding me back from finishing Samus Returns and this is an issue I need to go back and finish Samus Returns but there's one other game I got pulled into this week that I need to mention one other quick thing because it was one of those games was like I didn't play enough of this a year ago and it came out so I'm gonna just fucking fall down the rabbit hole hard this week and I played a lot of it over the last weekend and stuff last weekend not this weekend but the week before civilization six that's right remember civilization and how addicted we all get to that game and somehow I only played it a little bit when it first came out but then I just kind of resisted and there was all this other games coming out and I was able to stay away from it well this week I was kind of sitting there looking at steam and civ6 started saying come play me actually do you know what it really was do you know what it was that brought me back to civilization that made me think about it I don't know if you guys have watched Star Trek discovery yet but the opening credits made me think of civilization I don't know why but they did like just like that the animation made me think of like the intro to like Civ 4 or something like I don't know this weird like connect in my mind I was like I need to go play civilization and I do that I do that sometimes do you guys ever do that have you ever seen like a movie or something and it's like it's not as like it's not necessarily like you go see Resident Evil and you're like I need to play Resident Evil like I remember when I went and I saw the movie stardust in theaters I immediately had to come home and play Elder Scrolls Oblivion like have you ever had like something like trigger you to go like I need to play that game kind of would do anything you can think of I'm looking at our chat over at live dot vog network calm to see if anybody has one although I know we're a little delay no but crawl made me want to play D&D which one crawl I saw it in the theater as a kid but every time I see it I just want to break out you know the rule book and find people who want to do you know second edition with me everyone got a mini but me man in chat says I watched Friday the 13th and wanted to go home and play operation actually you know what I always won't play splatter house oh yeah why the stupid Friday the 13th game splatter fucking house splatter house splatter house kind of was Friday the 13th wink wink not it was much better than the game that had the name on it I love the NES one I don't give a fuck like I know people hate on the game all the time and I understand it is not a good game let me make that clear but there's a certain charm to it I just I can't get away from it's so good all right anyhow uh let's move on I want to talk a little more about some announcements here and then we'll get into some gaming news so you can always follow us on twitter twitter.com slash olr we're also on facebook facebook.com slash orange lounge radio I think we don't have any shows off scheduled in the coming weeks so we should be here maybe Veterans Day I'm thinking over that holiday in November it's around November 11th 12th maybe gone that weekend but unsure yet so we'll keep it posted because that's still over a month away so meanwhile we are gonna get into some gaming news let's do it let's start off tonight Loki's not here tonight so I'll start off tonight and let's oh what going you said the Loki's not here I know it's sad it is sad all right I'm still cuter he'll be back he'll be back next week so it sounds like folks that are in the Nintendo creators program I don't know if you remember this but this is a program that Nintendo wanted people to sign up for to basically validate their YouTube streams and enter a sort of revenue share with Nintendo and it was the way that Nintendo was going to stop basically like copyright claiming your videos all the time and and doing the monetization and that I am really oversimplifying the situation here for time so sorry but apparently folks that are in that program actually got sent an email talking about that live streams can no longer be done what yeah Nintendo's creator program sent an email that goes like this thank you for using the Nintendo creators program we've updated the Nintendo creators program user guide with information on how revenue generated during live stream broadcasts on YouTube will be handled in the Nintendo creators program live streaming on YouTube falls outside the scope of the Nintendo creators program this means that you cannot broadcast content on YouTube live from the account that you've registered to the Nintendo creators program please check the user guide for details thank you for your support blah blah blah blah blah like so what what does Nintendo have against their content creators doing live streams and that I guess is the piece that I'm not really figuring out like why did they maybe you guys know in our chat room over at live.vognetware.com but why did Nintendo suddenly decide to pull the plug on this did something go on where maybe like in a live stream something kind of nefarious and bad was going on and bad words were said and things like that during a Nintendo game and maybe Nintendo can't really monitor that stuff effectively I'm not sure what it is I feel like it's got to be a control thing at the end of the day yeah and that's what dark to see in our chat room kind of things over at live.vognetware.com maybe live streams are harder to police I'm really not sure Kaijuto says this this freaking streaming out tube game cutscenes BS is getting out of hand let's see vidpower in chat says does Nintendo's policy cover twitch as well well what's interesting about that is that the creators program wasn't for twitch it was for YouTube and all of the content that goes up on there because that's the on-demand content and obviously YouTube had their monetization program in advance kind of before twitch had theirs I mean twitch had the partner program but the twitch stuff has really blown up with the affiliation and the bits and subscribers through all that program so I'm not sure Nintendo has figured out how to battle the whole twitch thing or if they can but I wonder if that's not gonna be something that doesn't happen before the end of the year maybe it's kind of starting with this YouTube thing but certainly that's one of the places my gut goes is well are these YouTube creators then just gonna go over to twitch although I don't know that might be a really hard thing to do to have your audience go with you you know like that's you don't want to risk losing your audience over a move like that I don't know tiger claw chat says this is why streaming on YouTube isn't a good idea to begin with everything is all nice and dandy on twitch well I don't think YouTube would want to think they think about it like that and then where does mixer fit into all of this and I know there's an easy joke to make there about it doesn't because nobody in the mixer but the reality is Microsoft is not gonna stop pushing mixer and mixer does have some things that you know separated apart from the competition so you know we have to consider that as well how is mixer gonna fit in all that whole equation probably whatever ends up happening to twitch is gonna happen a mixer but we'll see I don't know so there you go that's something that's happened I don't know what the future holds for the streaming program Dark Sakura do you think Nintendo needs to stop doing this to their streaming population the people that evangelize their games or does Nintendo have the fucking right to say our games our rules Nintendo has the right to say our games our rules but they need to be willing to give a little bit to their fan base you know there has to be a balance and I think that they're just taking that we need all the control ever to all the things line that they always do so I mean it's not really a should they or should they not it's a they've already done it it doesn't matter what we think they should do does that make sense no no I mean totally it does I mean you're right we can whine and bitch and moan all we want but at the end of the day Nintendo can do do whatever they want to do with their copyright but Jamie I guess an important you know thing to keep in mind is that these YouTube creators then in turn have the right to ask themselves do I want to keep supporting Nintendo or am I gonna tell them to fuck off I mean and that will be the interesting thing as a result of this but it's I think it's really hard for a lot of people to walk away from Nintendo because of the fact they have such gigantic behemoth things for this Super Nintendo classic I'm sure tons of people are streaming gameplay on all 21 of these games right now but this would all you know be a part of that you know and when Nintendo does put out a game like when Mario Odyssey comes out there's gonna be tons of people that want in on that I want to watch people play it and want to stream it and so on and so on I mean no matter what Nintendo's rules on the whole thing might be dark Tetsuya playing a nice line here saying meet the fans in the middle I agree though it could be worse it could be like Atlas and persona 5 which I think is still on what somewhat under embargo and he's referencing that whole rules and restrictions that Atlas put out about we're gonna copyright strike you if you broadcast past a certain date in game remember that whole thing so that was a little bit too much over the edge so Tigerclaw pointing out that people are streaming Samus Returns on Twitch and you know what's interesting about that Tigerclaw streaming from the 3ds isn't exactly easy to do I mean as far as I know and correct me if I'm wrong but I think you have to modify a 3ds like you have to pay like a bit of money like hundreds of dollars maybe like 200 $300 to mod your 3ds to put in a capture device to be able to stream from the 3ds because it doesn't have like a built-in HDMI output or anything like that the switch is different it has HDMI output so you can use the same capture card that most people are using for other devices like PlayStation 4 external of the native streaming same thing with Xbox one so and as a live streamer on twitch twitch TV slash Rob Roberts plug plug it's easy to straight if you have a capture card streaming on the switch is fucking easy but I can't do the 3ds yeah and Tiger cloud points out you modify your 3ds or you can buy a 3ds with a capture device installed exactly as its cost it costs a bit more money and the reason why I point that out is that like these fans on Twitch are paying more money to be able to stream Nintendo's games now granted you know some of the more successful ones get their bits and their subscribes and they're you know high viewer counts and their money they get their money back on that investment it's a business investment for some people but for many makes it a tax write-off for many it's not well if you have the paperwork filed to have your own business yeah as your streaming business as a business I would wonder how many of twitches top streamers actually have registered LLCs you'd be surprised you think it was on like one of the you know how to monetize your twitch things I was looking at I guess when you get to a certain point somebody probably approaches you and says have you thought about this for I guess that probably happens to a lot of people I don't know I'll never get there what do I know although it would to be fair vog is an LLC and Bobby really figured a lot of that stuff out that I couldn't figure out but we do have that business end of things but we're not really making money off this venture we just have it so that when we try to approach conventions for sponsorships and things like that people know we're serious that we are a business and that we're not just you individuals so we have it more for the you know being able to have formal paperwork sort of thing formalizing a lot of things and yeah and hopefully in the future maybe some extra stuff yeah and Bobby's pointing out you do have an LLC well yes I know what but that's see Bobby I don't have my own LLC that's a little difference a little difference there all right anyway let's move on more Nintendo fuckery right yeah well the Wii shop channel is going to be shutting down in 2019 January so that is a year and a few months you know coming down the line and that means that all of the virtual console titles that are there to be purchased will be going away right alongside it including you know games like Kirby's avalanche act razor Super Smash Brothers already you know going away and then when it goes you won't be able to buy those games anymore I don't know anything about still being able to play them but you won't be able to buy them anymore and of course there's no virtual console on the switch so I think that that might be where all these minis are coming from you know to corner the market on it so it's it's sad but not unsurprising you know sad yeah it's it's also kind of that whole like shock of here is the digital era that we live in when we buy all this stuff online the reality that someday these stores are gonna close and that's kind of the scary part of this is that you know if you bought all these games online I mean you're not gonna be able to download them again after now granted after 2019 on what will essentially be a 13 year old console at that point but Jamie you as a console collector now I guess the easy answer is you don't buy a lot of stuff online I'm sure you don't because you know you get the cartridges and stuff but there's a lot of stuff you could only buy online you know there's there was you know releases on we shop that were only online for example the after years Final Fantasy for the after years yeah that was only on the we shop and I'm not gonna be able to download that anymore so it's like if I have memory loss on my little cartridge or some type of rot or something like that I don't know or it damages them out it's gone forever yeah that's kind of kind of scary I don't know I mean I guess in the reality you could lose a cartridge the same way but still I don't know it's just I guess sometimes we think like oh we'll be able to access these games whenever we want but that doesn't really end up holding true what do you think it's a collector about that does that kind of like irritate you that there's not gonna be any way to download these games again or is it just one of those well it just is more incentive to get backups on SD cards as fast as possible um I just think it's sad you know it's it's taking away a service I mean for the people who've already paid for it I think they're just like oh well sorry we got your money fuck you some comments in chat over at live dog network comm stop he points out that blaster master sequel was only on the e-store that's true even though blast master zero is better but certainly you know you still the completionist want to visit all the games let's see Bob coffee and chat says after years got released on steam and PSP as part of its Final Fantasy 4 part if it port if I recall correctly I believe force the steam release I can't remember the PSP one but for the steam release that was done in the 3d style the one that was on the Wii was still the sprite based it was like it looked like a fucking ROM hacked Final Fantasy 2 you know what I mean cartridge is what it looked like on the Wii shop so it was kind of different on steam and you know some people want to see one way versus the other you know so Tigerclaw points out excite bike world rally was a game that I bought on the Wii shop I bought some Castlevania game on the Wii shop that was a remake I think of the Gameboy game that they put on the Wii shop at one point and so that will be gone forever here's the other thing to realize too is that some of the games on here they aren't just Nintendo games I mean you've got at the Alex Kidd series you've got a lot of the the Neo Geo games so these are the virtual console games that will no longer be available because they're not on Wii U eShop which is different Wii U eShop is different any of that stuff yeah Castlevania Rondo of blood hmm which good luck finding the PC Engine version y'all unless the switch gets all this well there was the re-release but I mean like the original yeah but I mean a lot of us kind of wonder oh well maybe the switch will come in D the switch will compensate for a lot of this stuff going away but things will have to be re-licensed agreements will have to be remade and maybe they won't be able to get an agreement to put out Rondo of blood again who knows so was I have a feeling because we live in the day and age where Star Fox 2 was dumped to a cartridge before the Super Nintendo Classic was released we live in a day and age where and it this is really probably already out there I just don't go out there and find it but I'm confident it's out there there's probably just a Wii emulator on your PC that you can someday put on a Raspberry Pi maybe you can't now but you will someday and all of these games that were on the eShop one day will have backups available online that are open to be able to play on emulators like I'm I'm confident that sort of technology to at least do it on the PC has got to already be there I just haven't gone looking for it on the dark web or whatever you want to call it so uh guys you doing chat says so where is the Wii shop on the Wii yes we're talking specifically about the Nintendo Wiis built-in shop that will no longer you can't buy or use anything on it after 2019 with early 2019 and you're not even gonna be able to add points so you can buy anything new after March of 2018 so you have now from now until March 2018 to get everything you ever wanted off that shop and that's it it closes after that and then it stays up for a basically another year so you can download backups and that's about it so all right um the entire class says I'm sure it will be possible since those games can be transferred to an SD card absolutely now the Wii U the eShop on Wii U that is staying open we don't know I have any word about that at this time but the reason why you keep seeing the Wii U in news stories about this is because every Wii U has a Wii in it you can do the backwards compatibility thing and you launch it in Wii mode and that includes a Wii shop on your Wii U because it's a full Nintendo Wii emulator so that's why you keep seeing that it's shutting down on the Wii U as well because it's the emulator part of it you're gonna be able to use so that's that's why it's all kind of together like that so all right in case you know says I thought the Wii shops been closed already maybe there's many people that can already think that so I mean you know to be fair when was last time you turned on your Nintendo Wii it's been a very very long time yeah I only use it now to play GameCube games because I have the older Wii that can play GameCube games because all my Wii data is on my Wii U I move pretty much that once we got our Wii U yeah moved everything over exactly so I don't really have anything on the Wii with the regular Wii anymore except the fact it's the only way I can play f-zero GX in my house because I don't even have a GameCube right now so but I'll take it all right and dark Tetsuya points out well aren't the Wii U switch and 3ds don't they all connect to the same store the e-shop that's a good point maybe I know because they do call it the e-shop across all the platforms I don't know if 3ds shop and switch e-shop and all that stuff are different but maybe we won't see this problem for the Wii U as quick as we think we might but anyway let's move on with some more news so don't spend too much time on things going away in a year and a half steam valve the guys behind steam taken on some fake games that were listed in steam 173 games removed from steam most of them made by a company called silicon echo studio and you can't buy them but if you happen to own one of these games you can still play them however no more trading cards will be available so if you bought it you can play the game but the games themselves are gone and the reason why I guess this whole thing went down is because the same company that owned this silicon echo and zonotron productions they were doing unity asset flips on steam and very cheap bundles outside of steam so all these the money they were basically getting was the trading card stuff so they were just basically you know throwing a bunch of garbage unity stuff together and then having the trading cards spit out and that's where they were essentially making their money was that whole thing and so people that wanted to boost their profile levels and really get into the trading card game and all that stuff that they would buy these really you know junk games to do it that's crazy so yeah cracking down on the proc practices is basically the reason for the policy valve saying that these games were removed from a few different steamworks accounts that were all run by the same person in valves full statements they said yes we have a full-time team monitoring reports then they identified an issue that led to the removal of some titles from a few different steamworks accounts these accounts are generating generating a lot of reports and frustration from customers and other developers it turns out the bad actors were all the same person operating under different accounts so steam trying to clean all the poop out of their store basically and also just a quick follow-up here in our chat over at live dog network calm Rama says the e-shops are web-based so they're shutting down the app and the links that to that specific shop for that console most likely each different e-shop leads to a mobile site that's probably true considering that the switch basically has a web browser in it you just don't have the full power of it unlocked yet yeah and Bobby black wolf pointing out that my we died before I got a Wii U I lost all my saves and never transferred data my fiance has a we because she got a lot of the fitness games she showed me today she was like 20 we fitness games but that's not surprising because that was some of the bread and butter of the we and what they sold a lot of those fitness games to register participation for this week's episode of orange andreide with vog network.com use the passphrase cherry anyhow let us move on dark soccer this has been one that affects several people that we know I mean first-hand that the SAG after a strike is tentatively over the strike's been going on for a year now since last October and they put out a press release saying that the agreement that they have right now will give them additional bonuses based on the number of recording sessions per game with $75 payments for the first session going up to 2100 after 10 sessions and that the payment is due no later than the release date of a game which is good because that gives them a significant increase to what they were making per per session and you know we'll also because I mean think about it your voice is your tool in that field and if you are having to change the way you speak or you know you're playing a murder victim in some game yeah you're doing damage to yourself and so yeah it should be compensated and they're also working on providing provisions for health issues like vocal stress and you know how there's a habit of finding people for being late or distracted at a session session and another one that would have required agents support their perform submit their performers for atmospheric voice sessions or face fines and those those sessions are really low-paying anyway so it's a lot of it is they're really working on just again trying to make voice actors as protected as other workers yeah so it's you know it's kind of scary how much we didn't really hear about this like it was really kind of you know when it first happened we were talking a lot about it and then and I say we not to just mean us here olr but I mean just like the the gaming blog world and then it's kind of like it just the issue disappeared for a long time and I don't know if we've really seen the full effects of this yet I mean we have a little bit like for example there's a new voice actor actress in life is strange the prequel right cuz the one from before couldn't come back I don't know if we've seen the full brunt of that yet but you know it's it's I'm happy this finally got resolved because you know who knows what games in 2019 would look like without the voice you know with Jennifer Hale not be able to do them or Nolan North or some of the you know big names that you come to know so it would definitely be sad but I would much rather see voice actors paid their true worth I'd rather see them valued for the amazing work that they do I'm glad they worked it out are working it out it's not complete yet okay but you know like it says it's tentative all right yeah I'm glad they're almost there all right well moving on to one more thing before we get to the classic game or is it system of the week let's get into a story about Atlas and DMCA takedowns and persona 5 but it's not what you think it's not the whole YouTube streaming thing we were talking about earlier this is a little bit different this is an emulation group called Nikko tikina I hope I'm saying that or no neko technica I think is that sorry I've totally read that wrong the first time neko technica I think would be their name and these guys actually had a patreon page that they were running for a game for a piece of software called RPC s3 it was a ps3 emulator being used to play persona 5 and so they basically were able to get this emulator to work to basically be able to play persona 5 on your PC they actually put up a blog post over atlas to justify why this action was necessary but like if you're gonna go to patreon and ask for money for this type of stuff you got to really watch how you're selling this type of stuff I'm totally like I don't I don't even need the statement from atlas to understand what happened here and it's kind of like the whole thing with the Super Mario 64 and Nintendo going after them like I don't like Nintendo going after these products but when they go to patreon and essentially ask for money and they're kind of bold enough to tie the intellectual property from these companies to the patreon like I'm sorry but what did you think was gonna happen especially with a company like Nintendo or in this case atlas which we know is covered bases that are in a different ballgame yeah that's really the heart of it dar tazuya and chats as a patreon I'm surprised Sony hasn't gone after them in that case huh anyway atlas in their statement said we don't want their players first experiences to be frame rate drops or crashes or other issues that can crop up an emulation that we have not personally overseen we understand that many persona fans would love to see a PC version and while we don't have anything to announce today we are listening for now the best way to experience persona 5 is on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3 and they actually can again they kind of go out of there I think they do more than Nintendo usually does in these cases to say we appreciate the buzz and awareness that the emulation communities to see this but and nowhere in their statement did they say but it's fucking illegal yeah so you know although well I should I should let me let me correct myself before the people jump all over what I just said the practice of the emulation itself the emulator isn't necessarily illegal right but it's when you tie these popular games and you're kind of implying that you know you use these to play these games and and then putting it on your patreon and all that stuff you that's when you get yourself into trouble you have to stick to homebrew stick to homebrew underground PlayStation 3 games homemade you know that weren't ever licensed by Sony in the first place that's the best way to pitch your emulator now I want to see what this emulators like were you able to find it somewhere no well no I I mean I'm just kind of curious about of course I'm still you know trying to get my brain figuring out how to play planet Harriers yeah Bobby Blackwell says at least stick to homebrew on the patreon page I mean the interesting thing about this and to be fair to the emulator team and all this stuff because again I don't want to sound like a complete asshole to what these guys are doing my assumption of this whole thing is that you have to have the persona 3 excuse me persona 3 persona 5 disc to put in your computer's blu-ray player to be able to emulate it so you know and that's what atlas is also taking issue with is that because the emulators kind of choppy that actual disc is coming through kind of choppy because it was not meant to be played on your PC it was meant to be played on a PlayStation 3 so it's the emulator people were not really encouraging you to steal games but by putting the games IPs in their emulator it is kind of encouraging people to do something that Alice doesn't want them to do so because I think technically it isn't the end-user license agreement although we all know that's a bit of a gray area and Bobby Blackwell said they actually give instructions on how to dump it on the patreon and that was the part that Atlas was upset about they gave you instructions on how to dump either the blu-ray or the digital download from your PlayStation 3 hard drive well that's that is the giant fucking problem right there period dungeon buster in chat says but if I own the original copy of the game my ps3 dies and I still want to play it I'm just screwed no get yourself an emulator dungeon buster just get yourself an emulator that doesn't put a patreon page up saying how to dump commercial games and putting pictures of those commercial games over it does that make sense so all right let's move on to the classic game of the week that with those first emulators that came out for those classic games although this week we have a twist because once a month dark soccer likes to dump into the gaming dump jump into the gaming vault take a big no I she she dumps all her games out off the shelf anyway that's the cat once a month she likes to find a system that she thinks is worthy of your attention and a little mini programming note tonight this is actually September's console of the month because reasons dark soccer was gonna do it last week but she was out last week so we no longer it was not able to do this so this is this is one day late this is a tardy and do classic game but I had the flu so this is a tardy entry for September's classic system of the month yeah yeah all right here it is what is the classic system of the month the Panasonic Q also sometimes known as just Q and game Q and of course you put Animal Crossing as the music here oh shit of course you did yeah so this is basically the game turn it up a bit you picked the GameCube tonight I think the GameCube but you're you're making a hipster by picking the hipster GameCube is what you did it was cool I wouldn't mind having one actually it actually is cool but I'll let you talk about it and it's a hybrid GameCube and DVD player that was manufactured by Panasonic be it only came out in Japan and it was meant to do what the Xbox and PlayStation 2 were doing which as in have a commercial DVD you know playback function instead of just using the Nintendo optical discs the Q was actually licensed by Nintendo to Panasonic as Panasonic made actually it wasn't necessarily a Panasonic it was a result of a deal that was a broker between much yeah I miss said that much cheetah who owned Panasonic and Nintendo and so when Nintendo said that they could produce the optical disc drives that they had an agreement allowing Matsuda to produce a DVD system with the ability to play GameCube games so it went into production on December 13 well it was released on September sorry December 13 2001 for roughly four hundred and thirty nine dollars u.s. and ceased production on December 18 2003 because not a lot of people bought it so it has a backlit LCD screen a front loading slot trade that actually had a lot of problems with it because of the rubber band in the motor would get brittle and snap but it had sound output in Dolby Digital 5.1 or DTS a separate subwoofer with a subwoofer boost and a really nice stainless steel chassis it came with gray controllers that had the Panasonic brand on it the thing is cool is that when you plug them in the little lights around the controller ports light up blue so it says blue on you know this polished steel finish and it was really neat but because of the legs it had on the bottom it actually had a special Panasonic Q Game Boy player that was designed specifically for it whereas the GameCube had you know its own version but yeah there was actually the buttons that are on the front of it it has one of the ones that I thought was neat is it has a surround sound virtualizer to it which you know it just boosts the channel output does sound like surround sound you know it's got your typical DVD buttons on it's got memory card ports on the side but I do like that it has like a bass boost another neat thing that it does now I've watched videos of DVD playback on it there's like a cinema mode that changes the illumination on the screen you know how it displays the video but there's also a dialogue booster which makes of course dialogues or whatever channel the dialogue might be in stand out from the background noise no surprise that Panasonic would have all these sound altering things right because that's kind of you know something they're known for that's one thing that I thought was really neat about it especially I was thinking about people who like a problem that I have sometimes is that if there's too much sound or like for example you have two people talking the voice all turns to mush for me you just like like the teachers in you know Charlie Brown specials and something like that would be wonderful to have but and on top of that too just it's a sharp looking little system it's you know it's got that steel body with the the clear cover around it it has that shiny front finish and on the back too I mean the thing has got some very interesting hookups on it hold on we have optical out we have a standard composite s video digital AV out it really is just for its time it's really really something else and so I you know I don't think it got a lot of appreciation you know people either already had their DVD players at the time but then again I know people who picked up ps2s to have a DVD player the other thing too is it actually does have video CD capability in it too if people still have those things so there you go all right there it is on the queue the classic console of the month Panasonic cute the GameCube she picked the GameCube everybody no I picked the GameCube I I actually you know the queue is absolutely as much crap as I'm giving Jamie this is absolutely a recognizable thing because of the fact it was like it was like this existing console that kind of had a fresh coat of paint that was very unique that of course we didn't get in the u.s. well and it's not the first time something like that has happened because remember we had the sharp twin Famicom kind of the last one I can think of yeah I think since then because there was the the Sega one that had the Sega CD playable yeah that would have been before GameCube was that that wasn't also Panasonic was it no remember and then sharp had the Famicom TV in Japan the closest thing I can think of is how the PlayStation TV thing is built into certain Sam is the Samsung TVs that have it so there that's the closest thing I can think of yeah the JVC x I ah was the one there it is and Rama said that he had a sharp TV ness but you know also Nintendo's licensed out you know to sharp for the twin Famicom you know the one that had the the built-in right business yeah I'm the built-in business I don't know what I'm saying lots of pun sorry I was just to say lots of puns about Q in chat rage nator in chat saying Q is a good antagonist in Star Trek the next generation as well and then that led to a bunch of Star Trek jokes there Bobby Blackwell says I would have bought a Q if it had come to the US vid power talking about they also made a Panasonic branded GameCube controller to go with the Q it was all from our chat room at live dog network calm I was actually thinking of Q from the Bond movies oh there you go all right well we are gonna take a break but we will be back with more of orange lounge radio we have more stories and your calls orange lounge radio all one word on Skype if you want to call us later when we take calls after this quick break don't go anywhere welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio live tonight on the 1st of October 2017 with episode number 702 of our show already in progress myself here with dark Sakura sadly no Loki tonight he was sick if you haven't already heard at the top of the show those y'all joining us live tonight hello and thanks for being here over in our chat room at live dog vog network calm those of you listening on the podcast feed whenever you want throughout the week appreciate that too hope you guys are having a good week whatever it is you're doing can't believe it's already October any Halloween plans I guess we have to start planning for that um no I don't know do do late late late 30s and 40 something's do things for Halloween anymore I might be doing like a charity thing oh that's great okay that's that's a good use of time good like I don't know yeah well maybe somebody that needs to have a charity event put on for them is Yoshi because apparently I don't know if you heard about it this week but there was a little bit of a thing going around the internet on some of the Twitter's and things like that that basically Mario is in fact in Super Super Mario world when you see Yoshi stick out his tongue you see Mario do a little thing that looks like this and that Mario enough for those obviously on the radio I'm kind of moving my fist down slowly but I think many of you know where I'm gonna go with this if you are reading something internet and it kind of always looks like Mario's going like go but it turns out according to a recent interview on Nintendo's official site the developers the Takashi Seizuka and Shigefumi Hino talked about the creation of this game and says that they talked about this where they want Mario to ride something and so forth like kind of like a horse that was kind of like a crocodile and so forth and then said in the interview lots of people think that when Mario is pointing his finger forward he's saying go and Yoshi's tongue comes out however the setup I drew was that when Mario punches Yoshi in the head the characters tongue shoots out in surprise what's more there's an added bop sound however it seemed like people would say poor Yoshi so that's why it became that Mario is saying go so the original artwork for that is Mario hitting Yoshi on the back of the head that poor poor poor thing and that's why I think so many people are fans of Yoshi because he had to put up with Mario shit for so long so stop be in chat over at live.vognetware.com says hey Yoshi ain't no saint in the Japanese version he eats dolphins that's true there are those dolphin monsters or whatever you want to call them that Yoshi can eat that's true so dark soccer does this change your world to know that all this time you've been punching Yoshi in the back of the head I've been rocked well well I guess in a way I'm shook Rob you get are you shooketh I am shooketh huh I shook it's I guess if you think about when you kind of ride horses you kind of kick them a little bit like you know there's a way there's a way to it I mean you're not just like unless you're an asshole who wears spurs yeah yeah yeah I mean there's a there's a way to it but you you know but still it just it kind of looks like a donkey punch but I guess never mind I'm not gonna go there you can fill in the blanks let's get to some rapid-fire news and cover some other news going on in the gaming industry a little faster here talking about doom on the Nintendo switch and people wondering if because oh well if dooms gonna be on the switch does this mean motion controls coming to the game and the answer is no it will not be like Splatoon where there's motion control aiming there's just gonna be the traditional analog controls the game will not have Splatoon like controls so this really is just a straight-up port it doesn't sound like they're doing a lot of enhancements for the switch at least not that we know of who knows you know Bethesda may surprise us with like a bonus level or something I always said putting like maybe not so much now I think about it maybe not Samus I don't think Samus would work so well in a game like doom but Ridley would so maybe something else from the Metroid universe would show up in the game anyway something else that many people are playing on the Nintendo switch is Sonic Mania granted it's on a bunch of other systems as well but specifically with a Nintendo version there is a home button issue when suspending the game so the good news is that whole feature whatever not feature of a bug is actually being addressed a patch is gonna be rolling out soon they haven't said when but soon I think it might be out by now because that was a tweet on September 25th so surely it probably came out in this past week so you can check that out so there you go how about you dark soccer what do you have for us there's going to be a new book come

dark saga they have this doll scene figure on here where he's like in the child pose and yoga mm-hmm with his arms like all the way across the room and I know it's the child pose because I did yoga mm-hmm but it's so weird so you're the authority on all things yoga okay apparently everyone's in this pose and they have a key change trap coming out of their ass what they get cooler figures in Japan than we do here that's what their cell phone character things things but I was like the fuck is this why do they have ropes coming out of their ass maybe they're into that I don't know the more you know we're gonna go to the mail bag over at participate at orange lounge radio.com where every week dark Sakura opens up the mail bag and finds jack shit nothing you guys didn't email us this week

what happened at the case of the missing emails you know what what part participate at orange lounge radio.com if you would like to send us an email and make Jamie work you better work I work enough okay it is hard work to be as amazing as I am and to be cuter than Loki Bobby Blackwell is asking if I check the regular mailbag account I don't I think those emails bounce I don't think and I fix the website so if you send something to the website it goes to the right email now so mailbag and orange on traders shouldn't come through at all I think those bounce now that was our old old old email address if I do need to go in there and check it I don't know how so anyway let's move on with some more news we're gonna start off talking about the Atari box that's right more information was announced on the Atari box this week and I don't know about you dark Sakura I'm not feeling this the Atari box is going to be running Linux it'll be out which is fine that's not that's not the part about me it's gonna be on an AMD chip it's gonna cost two hundred and fifty dollars yeah so the Atari box will be running on Linux with an AMD processor it'll be between 250 to 300 dollars Atari box creator and general manager I'm gonna totally mispronounce his name and I apologize fair gal Mac said that the Atari is going to be doing a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo to launch the Atari box in the spring of 2018 the Atari box is gonna launch with a back catalog of classic games so the box will make people hopefully you know want to play stuff that in past as you know the Super Nintendo classic and stuff is done well with this but also going to run independent games like minecraft air char and Terraria and the things that people want to do today you will also be able to do streaming run apps around the rows the web play music because this is basically a PC or a Raspberry Pi a little stronger though but in an Atari box feedback from fans on things like content colors and so forth will come into play on this so you can look forward to that if you want to fund this on Indiegogo here's my problem with this whole thing is that as much as they want to do the whole classic nostalgia thing you guys know those flashback consoles that are out there's already an Atari flashback console that I think is 60 or $70 I think there's several models they're up to I don't know if you know this Jamie have you seen those Atari flashback things before yeah I think I have one like in a drawer somewhere they're fine they get the job done they're basically like the NES classics basically but for you know sorry they're up to eight so this year is the Atari flashback 8 do you know how many Atari cartridges we have laying around Oh God well there were so many games right so that's why the whole thing lived for like ever yeah no what's hardy Atari party next year by the way oh really yeah it's tragic that is sad I'm sad but anyway in my heart you can have an Atari party where it whenever you want if you have well if you have all the real stuff or a flashback 8 is what they're up to now the new thing they added this year Activision finally let them put things like kaboom and pitfall I think is in there and hero and some of the Activision games which really were like some of the biggest titles on the 2600 were old-school Activision and yes that same Activision that's around today that owns Blizzard I mean they got their start really in the 2600 era do you remember why Activision got so popular and why so many people went to go make games for Activision because it was a bunch of Atari people that left yeah because Activision would properly credit their developers yeah there's that because when pitfall was made it was David Crane's pitfall remember also oh crap what was it no it was EA that used to do the album artwork oh and have the pictures of the developers inside like they were abandoned everything that was cool yeah so I guess no wonder they're in the same bed now yeah maybe act F points out there's also a gold version of the flashback yeah that's the one drawback is that there's like there's a flashback 8 there's a flashback 8 Activision Edition there's a flashback 8 gold edition and like all of them have like slightly different games on them and I don't know if it's like a gotta collect them all type of thing but that part's kind of annoying just have one with all the fucking games on it cuz we know that like you can fit every Atari 2600 game like ever made on like one of those older floppy disks from the 1990s like seriously Atari games are not that big they were what 4 kilobytes 8 kilobytes yeah maybe the biggest ones ever were like 32 kilobytes and that's pushing it I don't even know if they ever got that big I don't think so so you take hundreds of those and you can you're not even gonna hardly fill up an old disk like that actually I'd like to point this out to kind of as a side note that's a side note right for people who want to see have an idea of what old arcade games look like the Atari arcade games there is a special I saw on it was YouTube or something maybe maybe Netflix but it was about Steve Jobs when he worked for Atari oh yeah cuz breakout was a Steve Jobs thing right I think him and was all right that's where they kind of met yeah but well they had already met before that but it was like the band's first album let's say that but the thing is that they talk about how many chips and how much money each chip took to make an arcade game and then later on you have then when you talk to the developers of some of the home versions of these games and taking you know the arcade game and trying to reprogram and compress it into such a smaller package I mean no wonder pac-man was kind of crap oh yeah it's the whole reason why pac-man was crap the developer of pac-man wanted a larger cartridge for that game and Atari said no and that's why pac-man could only draw one goes to frame why I was sweaty balls anyway so anyway here's the thing with you try boss I don't want to be a hater I want to see Atari succeed believe it or not I'm rooting for you but Atari has to figure out what's its niche because the problem is I can fucking play Minecraft and Terraria on fucking Xbox 360 at this point which is gonna be way cheaper than $250 fucking a Xbox one s aren't those down to like 200 bucks at this point same thing with PlayStation 4's like the entry models those are getting cheap like and if those are gonna be cheaper than an Atari box Atari needs to find its niche and the classic game archive on Atari somebody else with the license beat you to it guys so you got to figure out how to strengthen that now how about just throwing it out there if you really want to milk the moustache nostalgia figure out something different you can do with those classic classic games that the flashback console can't do you can have a pure emulation mode fine but what about something like here I go you ready Xbox 360 game room where you had the leaderboards the videos you could play online with somebody else now you're milking that classic arcade library with something a little extra that doesn't exist on the flashback console that might appeal to some people you know that's a start but again that price is still pretty high I think you know Atari box is really gonna have to figure out like what's its niche what can what's it really gonna be able to do they can't already be done by a device that many people already have in their living room that would be the audience for this sort of thing that's sort of my my take on that oh and dark Tetsuya points out I even forgot about this those PlayStation 4 and Xbox one collections there's already two volumes of those you're right there's already Atari collections on PlayStation 4 and Xbox one so you can even play old Atari games already on Xbox one so Atari box figure out how you're better than Xbox one okay Rama points out Xbox one s is between 249 and 299 okay fair same price as what Atari box is looking at so how are you gonna be better than Xbox Atari or what are you gonna give that Xbox can't that's the only way this sorry Atari your heyday is over is the only way it's gonna work yep good luck I hope you can figure it out all right let's move on with something else dark soccer well this is the ultimate of splat fest in the first one I actually give a shit about kind of literally Nintendo of Europe has announced the next date in time for their next splat fest in Splatoon 2 it's the first full week of October and it asks a question that is relevant to my interests which way should your toilet paper go over or under it goes under its team front roll if it's under its back roll back roll I know right I was thinking I'm sorry my favorite thing this is this was my proud Twitter moment I have a lot of Twitter moments where I'm like shaking my head this is the worst dumpster fire of an internet website but a rare proud Twitter moment came on the announcement post for this that Nintendo made on Twitter there were so many replies with the Alyssa Edwards gif going back rolls and I was like Twitter I'm proud of you in this particular moment so there you go so anyway it starts off on October 7th and it will run for a full 24 hours but of course we know that the right way to do it is front roll this is one of those things where I just I don't care and not like I understand this is a very controversial thing I just I feel like I don't have a horse in this race that's this what it is like I'm not I don't care if the paper is front or back I really don't I really don't I just care if it's three-ply but if you do it the wrong way you're wrong you're wrong and you should feel sad have they said if they're doing this in America yet I'm trying to see if no I haven't seen anything about the u.s. yeah I'm looking I'm looking at the wiki and I don't see it but I don't see the Europe one listed there either so I'm wondering if one of our Splatoon fans in chat over at live.vognetwork.com knows the answer come on no Gus and chat says leave it to Europe to tackle the real issues guys you don't chat says do you ever look at an adding machine the paper is back roll yeah but if you look at the patent for toilet paper it goes over oh god here we go let's see act it's also gif act theft and chat points out Japan's new Splatfest is stamina versus power that one's interesting but it's not like the types of things that divorces are made on like this Splatfest it's no you know what my divorce would be huh god damn it close the lid I'm taking the cat and moving to Japan bye no really and marrying Margaret Cho no I'm done with that oh you don't mention her anymore that fantasy is over I apologize I'm not interested in her anymore okay you moved on I am interested in just living my moe moe dream in a little farmhouse okay in Japan work close enough to a train station that I can go to cool places let's see an act up just confirming that America has not gotten a new Splat that Splat fest yet so we don't have the official announcement however it is worth pointing out the first three for America in Europe were all the same so if this does change it would be the first one that is different so we'll see what happens there all right there it is the world's most controversial Splat fest it's gonna get ugly I don't know what team to pick you know I just I don't care enough so I just I guess I'm gonna figure out what my friends pick and go with that so all right let's move on to another story what what don't be Alyssa no back rolls but I like Alyssa Edwards I like Alyssa but no back rolls all right I'm gonna ask a drag queen what I should do all right I can arrange that right now you know one thing I think we can all agree you shouldn't do is buy Marvel vs. Capcom infinite ball I'm sorry I'm sorry it was a really low blow I'm sorry horrible transition well the bar isn't that high but here look here's the reality guys and I apologize to the MVC I fans out there but your games your game struggling a little bit that's the reality of the situation and that's here it is the sales charts are happening the Japanese charts came out this week some media create reported the numbers Marvel vs. Capcom infinite charted at number eight on PlayStation 4 with 8,273 copies sold keep in mind the Xbox one is a non factor in Japan we don't even know how many it sold there but it wasn't many here's the thing so 8,000 copies sold 8,000 and change Pokken tournament DX with the number one spot fifty three thousand three hundred ninety three copies that is a re-release of a Wii U game essentially now to be fair not everybody had the Wii U this is part of the reason why it's being re-released but still that is over what five I'm trying to do math fast five six times as many copies of Pokken tournament sold the Marvel vs. Capcom infinite in Japan also worth noting super Street Fighter 2 turbo HD remix for the switch 16,404 copies Street Fighter 2 outsold Marvel vs. Capcom infinite in Japan this week Street Fighter 2 what do you think of that Jamie I have nothing to say by the way in the UK kind of a similar story just so you know it's all poop it's it's not looking good there in the UK either it was mentioned in a tweet that ultra Street Fighter 2 for Nintendo switch had a better opening weekend than Marvel vs. Capcom infinite although I don't have the numbers over there as well so there it is act-def in chat over at live.vognetwork.com also points out Pokken tournament on the Wii U sold more than Street Fighter 5 on release so I'm not surprised that is true that was kind of a quote-unquote shock I guess you could say at that time although you know those that have played Pokken tournament I know many I know many folks that are really really into that such as act-def I have a copy and haven't played it yet it's it's good I have it on Wii U I'm a little hesitant to buy it again on switch I don't really I don't think I played it enough to justify the repurchase but I think if you didn't get it on Wii U and you like fighting games at all and you know especially Tekken which you know obviously this has a lot of Pokken it has a lot in common with it I think it's worth a look I do I I would recommend it on that basis but I don't know if I would want to rebuy it myself I'm just not that into it to do that but there you go so anyway sorry to you Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite fans but I don't know I don't know Capcom kind of dug themselves a hole with this one and I don't know if it's the fact that the x-men aren't in it or just the art style at first was just sending a bad message when this game was first revealed or they just made a bad game but this is not bode well for Capcom and fighting games when they're their game from 1990 yes an updated remix and all that stuff yes yes but still a game from that long ago is doing better I don't know what that says anyway speaking of games from long ago Dark Sakura hmm data East need I say more data East gave us bad dudes karate champ kung fu master and burger time burger time yes yes well um there is a company called G mode that is working on a data East revival project so on their page that says are you looking for a data East license here's the answer G mode owns over 100 titles of deco data East franchises which includes let me just pick the ones that don't you know especially suck well I played fighters history a bit I kind of like that Joe and Mac lock and chase midnight resistance midnight resistance is a fucking good game Dark Lord burn and rubber bloody wolf bad dudes versus dragon ninja crude buster also known as two crude dudes so yeah they're working on trying to re-release some of the games and basically you can reach out to them on their webpage so that they can find a partner to get the games out so yay fighters history I still remember I care more about midnight resistance to be honest I still remember not that long ago there was like a burger time reimagining game that came out and it kind of came and went and I want to say it even got delisted at one point because I think the idea was they probably lost the license and maybe this kind of answers where it went is back in the pool for someone else to snatch up so someone snatched yes so maybe you know I don't know maybe some like really hardcore developer can pick up burger time and do like a burger time ultimate type of game we're like you murder those fucking eggs and bacon the chase you around the board be like zombie burger exactly all right from the developers of Bayonetta bring you burger time three all right I think this is really cool actually I I think this is this actually makes the Assassin's Creed series which is not something that I really ever super get into it's just you know again I don't have time obsessed though this I think this is great though is that what they're doing is that in the latest Assassin's Creed game Assassin's Creed origin a free origins update in 2018 is going to let you turn off combat story and challenges for an educational mode called discovery tour and it's because of the you know high-level graphics engine that these games provide this is gonna allow you to way to actually kind of explore ancient Egypt in an educational sort of sense and if you're kind of rolling your eyes at educational games well then don't fucking play it there's Assassin's Creed origin for you to play but I think this is kind of a really neat enhancement to an existing game to use the engine for something you know like if you like this game so much why don't you learn a little something about it well to point out and I mentioned this before when I was taking a little it was a few years ago when I was taking art history that my teacher used scenes from Assassin's Creed 2 no to illustrate Italy during the Renaissance because I mean some of the you know the the buildings around you know are of course severely damaged and things have been rebuilt and everything but it she said that you know from maps and pictures that was a fairly good likeness yeah of you know Italy around that time of Rome you know and so we had slides from Assassin's Creed 2 in our history that's cool and then we talked about how the de-medicis hated each other well anyway discovery mode is gonna be out in early 2018 it will not be there when the game releases on October 27th but you do have this to look forward to again in this mode you're gonna be able to explore ancient Egypt there will be no enemies running around they will also add a series of guided tours curated historians and Egyptologists will be available I guess in the game maybe they're getting some people to do some voicing and some writing for this stuff you can learn directly about pyramids Cleopatra mummification and more you can learn all about all the those big things that go with I would play that I think that's neat I think it's just kind of neat I would totally be down yeah so very cool props to the developers for doing that vidpower in chat says age of empires 2 is my favorite education game you know I learned stuff from civilization you know as much as you might kind of laugh at that you know when you build wonders of the world you might learn you know they get do a little narration about why they built it and you know what it was for and all that stuff so you kind of learn you know I thought it was kind of cool all right just a few more stories for you guys dark Sakura one more story from you yeah well you know we've hit the 30th anniversary for a Mega Man or Rockman and there was a phrase that was said by the producer of the Mega Man Legacy Collection to Kazuhiro Tsuchiya and as it was said I'm just gonna read the quote because it's very interesting I want to say the Capcom has not forgotten about Rockman the logo here is being put to good use that was the 30th anniversary logo Rockman's 30th anniversary is coming in December December please remember that date on behalf of Uchi and everyone here we are looking forward to it very much and hope

different new game I played make it to you yeah new game or get the fuck out you know what legends 3 or get out what if they did like you know how Megaman X was all the the big release now huh what if they did like a new type of Megaman platforming franchise Megaman Z why not make a man said mm-hmm why not do it I as long as the game's good that's what I fucking care about we have the improvement upon Megaman EXE now we have Megaman DMG anything is possible so it can be a Mac installer and auto windows executable all right one more story for you guys before we open up the skype line at orange lounge radio all one word and yes I saved the best for last tonight at least from my perspective very excited to hear about this there is going to be a Commodore 64 mini as if the NES classic and the Super NES classic wasn't enough now Jamie this one this one would be worth getting because most Commodore 64 is don't even fucking work anymore like it's very hard to find one that actually works so I love this that they're actually doing this so they're actually going to be putting out a Commodore 64 mini it's going to be a fully licensed recreation of the 80s they call it console but it was kind of a computer it will connect via HDMI it will have a joystick even though there was no official joystick for Commodore 64 there were a few popular ones that I think this is based off of and there will be of course 64 licensed games haha the console will be half the size of the original those things are huge some of the games to look forward to California games impossible mission another visitor stay a while stay forever you ever play that game with the bad synth in the beginning no I didn't but what was that school game that terrible school game or was it on Amiga the school game I don't know there's a lot of like educational game or like out of school you were in a school maybe it was on Amiga and maybe maybe I really like this art of art game where was I speedball to brutal deluxe paragroid you can look at more information over at VC 64.com slash games you can actually look at all the games in it including and this is kind of funny chips challenges in this I know the guy that made this game actually so I kind of want to bring he lives here locally so I kind of want to bring him on OLR to talk about this maybe I I want to know if he even knows this is being made he may or may not I don't know impossible mission 2 is gonna be in there as well which is the less noteworthy sequel Monty on the run that was a huge game if you were kind of into games back then anyway there's some good picks in here I'm cyber annoyed those games were really big on Commodore 64 you know last ninjas missing and some other stuff but you know I think there were only so many licenses they could get they couldn't get things like Donkey Kong's c64 port and things like that but this is this is to be a pretty good selection I'm very interested to look for to see it here so anyway I'm looking in chat over at live dot vog network calm black wolf actually has an answer for you school days maybe and that's it you said yes school days that was it because I remember the classrooms were yellow Wow Wow good job Bobby all right it was for the spectrum that's what I was thinking of other things that are available on this mini classic Commodore 64 pics pixel filter options save game functions and the ability to use a USB keyboard no word though if it has the full Commodore 64 shell in it like where you could launch into basic and maybe program your own thing I don't know if it's gonna go that far but that would be really rad if it did I'm sure somebody would hack it to do that it will be out in early 2018 and it will go for sixty nine ninety nine euros because it's not coming out in the states it's coming out overseas of course not yeah so there it is it's not gonna be coming out here it's coming out overseas I hope they will find a way to release it here I understand that Commodore 64 was huge overseas especially you know in the UK and stuff but I have a big place in my heart for it here so I really hope they find a way to put it out here it's being developed by retro games not the same company as retro computers who are making the Sinclair Vega Plus retro games did the 64 and they're working with kosh media who owns deep silver to distribute the console so that's pretty exciting yeah I agree Tiger Khan chat says you could import it it'll cost more yeah I probably could I mean hopefully these things won't have the scarcity problems that consoles over here have had with Nintendo stuff and I can just ask one of my friends over there to go into a shop and get me one like you know send them money or whatever and then just have it sent that way maybe one of my pals from girls gone Wow or geek card or something like that one of our vlog shows in the UK maybe somebody your pal pals my pal pals yes my pal pals I get it power yeah you're funny all right if you

games but you know what cuz reginator calls into this show all the time and I'm sure y'all are curious you know and you want to hear the good news when things happen and he's family that's right he's fam so we're happy for him here at orange lounge radio speaking of fam I think we're getting another call on the line right now connecting so let's check in hi you're on orange launch radio who's this it's the ringtone I thought I should kind of have that as a real tone on my phone you probably could get it y'all you probably just need a Windows phone it's alright I think it's connected this time you shut your poor mouth even Bill Gates I think uses nature all right no wait no look we got a caller on the line hi you're on orange launch radio who's this it's Ron man I'm kind of speechless right now because I heard somebody trash-talking a Windows phone yes keep in mind I don't like any phone that isn't an iPhone cuz I only buy good stuff she's a she's a fangirl oh yeah that I know it doesn't help the fact that at work I have an iPhone and I'm sitting here looking at it I want to build and make basic adjustments where I can do a Windows mobile and Android and a friend was like oh yes swipe from the bottom I threw the phone across the room and said I quit for the whole damn day I did it's bad enough I want to make a ringtone create a phone to call ringtones drop the song in the system will see it iPhone you gotta use iTunes go through iTunes I still can't do it go dig it around found a program that is for trial where I just want one song as my ringtone and that's it it took me five minutes tops yeah well it shouldn't by just creating a folder on the phone itself it should automatically pick it up I shouldn't need special software to do it and I'm just like all right all right we didn't easy we didn't we didn't you I know your intention was not to call in to talk about cell phones so what's on your mind tonight buddy was it a couple of things um one I'm shook about this Atari box pardon me but I'm summoning my inner techno nerd rage and some of Loki's rage you mean to tell me an AMD powered console by Atari it's gonna run between two hundred and fifty and three hundred dollars no no I can understand if it was an Intel yes I can get that but unless they are opening up this console for not just for the classic games where you can develop games for the Atari box I'm sold brand new next-gen games retro games on an Atari box I'm so what it okay Ramit for what it's worth I do think that's part of what they want to do they want to do Minecraft Terraria they want to do those types of modern games it's not only classic games I think that's important to put out there well that's good I'm all for that because if this thing at this price is no more powerful than a game queue or a weed then you know what it's gonna stay right on the shelf the crowdfunding part of this kind of worries me too a dark to see it dark to see it brings up a damn good point sounds like the Ouya but probably more powerful but the okay let's yeah the I mean there's there's a few Ouya fans left but for the most part like everybody was mega hype about the Ouya and then like Ouya kind of who yucked out the door in like three months see but the difference I see on the software aspect is Ouya was powered by Android you can root and jump into that this is gonna be a pure Linux system where they're gonna be locking it down a little bit more it's gonna be they're gonna be able to do a little bit more with the hardware itself with the OS see our buddy our buddy Brad from pod culture jumped in I liked my Ouya he's but Brad I love you dude but you're the one Ouya fan that I know of out there but that no I mean that's cool that's cool but most people were kind of you know didn't really find the reason to get it eventually anyway you still with us mama yeah I'm still here I'm still here bro it's all good anything else in your mind to share super NES classic oh yes I understand everybody's like you know what F Nintendo I'm gonna go out and get the roms I'm gonna go out and emulate it I'm gonna go build my Raspberry Pi and all of this you know what I actually thought about doing it cuz I have a Raspberry Pi but I won't do it because I am that lazy I will not sit here and like Bobby Blackpool said spend the whole afternoon putting it together no I ain't got time for that nobody got time for that but I will say there are games on this this system from my teenage years my childhood that I absolutely love and the main reason why I will put in the attempt to get one is because of Secret of Mana that game got me through a really hard time in my life I hope I have so many memories with Final Fantasy 3 you know and yes I know it's really six but to 15 year old Rob it was Final Fantasy 3 I have so many memories with that game like I can't even I I can't even bro I used to rent father see three from the video store and every time I returned I would re-rent it or if I couldn't re-rent it I'd hope and pray that I'd remember what the what the subcode was on the game side knew which one the rents I could pick up from my save game and hope and pray at some asshole didn't delete it I I I threw diva fits I did whatever chores had to be done I kissed ass I did everything it took to get Final Fantasy 3 once I played it at a friend's house that's what I did to get my Super Nintendo period and then getting it for Christmas I was like yeah boy I love it yeah I'm you know I probably that's fine if people want to do the emulator thing then cool but I think there's there's some weird connection that some of us have with the whole fact that it is the official Nintendo product and it is you know the official channels there there's just something that just can't kind of you also know there's been a lot of quality checks for something like this that maybe haven't happened on the whole emulator side that I think are somewhat important but you know I'm not gonna knock people that choose to do the emulator thing you know more fine it is what it is but just understand that there's people that want to do it this way too okay you know what you can go out and do all that you can actually buy a 3d printed Super Nintendo shell to put on your Raspberry Pi oh you can actually go that far you know you know let's let's talk about this Rama let's talk about this is important I don't even really like Raspberry Pi like lemon meringue is superior no no no no it's all about peach cobbler my dude peach cobbler I okay versus Raspberry Pi I'm with you there but the all-time supreme is no surprise coconut cream pumpkin pie thank you very much god you are so extra wrong well thank you I haven't been given a compliment on that cream which makes me now when they go to nations banana creams my second favorite I want to go to nations now Rob I have my friend had a birthday on Friday and we had banana cream pie at the dinner oh so fucking good anyway Rama you made the conversation go back to food whether you intended to or not I'm gonna let you go so we can try squeeze in one more call but thank you go for it dude all right take everybody all right bye all right bye all right that was our friend Rama from anime jam session Tuesday nights here at the voice geek Network and let's see oh wow this is a nice change where the phone is actually ringing off the hook tonight because usually it's not and I have to sit here and vamp for time now I just have to vamp for time because this fucking tablet is slow to connect and that is definitely a goal before the end of the year is to upgrade see and now I hung up on him son of a bitch sorry buddy call back if you got this orange launch radio all one word on Skype it is my goal before the end of the year to have this replaced so and I when I say this I waved my hand at the studio stuff when I said this okay I think we are connected this time and I can say hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hi there's a deaf hey act F buddy how's it going not so great good to see you but I'm sorry it's not so great what's what's wrong well it's the next classic Amazon Amazon fucked you again didn't they you guessed it well I read Twitter but here's the thing here's the thing didn't didn't you learn after they wronged you last time one would think that one would think that that I would have learned the lesson that I would have to stay away from Amazon no look I'm teasing you a little bit I also understand I also understand that the Super Nintendo classics were so desirable that people kind of went to where they could get one so like I was able to get one at Best Buy which oh I never told the story about why what how I ran into trouble at Best Buy sorry deaf I'm gonna hijack your call for a minute but this is important problem all right thank you you know at least you can watch okay so Jamie get this so I pre-ordered my SNES classic on Best Buy when I was lucky and I found it on Twitter and I fell in that 20-minute window and I get the pre-order there right I go into Best Buy and they say what's your name and I give them my last name that you would see on my credit card in my driver's license right and they say we don't see that in the system and I'm like here we fucking go and I'm thinking in my mind I knew I knew this is too fucking easy I knew I knew it and it turns out they looked at my barcode and they're like we see you here it looks like this is for Rob Roberts and I'm going fuck so as you guys I'm sure know Rob Roberts yes that's my name here on Orange Launch Radio that's my internet persona name but that is my fake name like Lady Gaga uses a fake name right so that's just something I've always done since way back when when Travis first got me into this he said you want to have a fake name so that was it Rob Roberts right so I don't know how that ended up on my Best Buy thing because I'm thinking like what but I wouldn't have that would have it that's not the name on my credit card or that like how did that fucking get connected to Rob Roberts well I'm thinking it might have somehow got tied to my Facebook account because that's something you could do on Best Buy is tied to your Facebook account so anyway so they and they wouldn't let me pick it up because I didn't have any ID that showed that my name is Rob Roberts so first thing I learned this week I need fake ID that says that I'm Rob Roberts second thing is that but this and the the happy ending of the story because I did finally get it I had to actually go on to the website in the store and put Rob real last name as my pickup person to actually pick up the console and had to wait there for like 10 minutes while it went through the system and the new label printed out there and so you can actually see Jamie if you look at the side of the box on that label it says my real name to pick up for my stage name which is funny because again the critic yes she's making this face of I think it's also stupid that they have stickies on here yeah I don't want a little tack I I hope yeah they're low tack okay that's good cuz I didn't like that either cuz there's no shrink wrap I almost said saran wrap a shrink wrap on that anyway there you go there's my story I don't know how my fucking stage name got on my Best Buy order when again that's not the name on my credit card but I have I have had stuff stuff shipped to the house under my stage name but usually that's like game companies sending me the very rare review copy or things like that because they're not gonna know me as my real last name they know me as Rob Roberts which most people on the internet do but anyway that's my whole my whole issue so but unfortunately act theft I know my story had a happy ending I just was slightly inconvenienced but yours we don't have a happy ending yet do we no it's it it's terrible because and and I was going to a point with with with actually learning from Amazon and not ordering from them but at least the previous times that they happen with the switch is having with a splatoon it even happened with Pokken Pokken DX it even happened there but at least I got a confirmation from them that I would get it right now anyone and I mean anyone ordered from Amazon doesn't know shit about when it's going to get fulfilled what's really frustrating about that whole thing and where I would be at in that position is that meanwhile the fucking treasure trucks showed up from Amazon selling those things in different cities and then what did it show up on prime now as well I feel like it did in some places it didn't show up in prime now but it showed up on instant pickup which is different because they I think they like send it to a place like that something like a p.o. box oh you can pick up there so and this isn't and of course the first thing I was gonna ask is is the fact that you're in Mexico have a complication on this but you actually do you have you have these things delivered to a u.s. address right yeah I have a u.s. address that a friend and I share basically yeah yeah it's it's also like a p.o. box but it's for all type of mail yeah exactly but yeah I have to do that because if I try to buy a SNES mini here in Mexico it's around the end that's this is a retail price it's not even like a scalper price it's around $140 Wow yeah it's cheaper to rent the fucking p.o. box it's crazy way cheaper Wow and it's crazy yeah yeah Amazon really owes their customers a really fucking good explanation I mean here's the reality I can tell you right now the Amazon that ships the SNES mini to your house is not the same Amazon that runs those treasure trucks and that's the reality that that's why this is happening they are separate companies that are well they're separate branches of the organization running under the same name that doesn't think I'm not excusing it but that's what's happening but the problem is most people don't understand that and most people see it's Amazon and why the fuck is Amazon screwing me over while meanwhile the trucks are pulling into major metropolis cities where maybe I don't even relive and letting people buy these things that ought to be mine that I pre-ordered and yeah I'm not I'm not angry towards the the treasure trucks or instant pickup because people got got their SNES classic that way and I'm happy for them I'm really happy kind of salty but happy at the end because sure it's it's something they want it's not their fault Amazon it's not their fault yeah yeah and and the only thing I would want from Amazon right now is to explain this stuff yes because Amazon hasn't said a word about it that's the most frustrating part that Amazon that hasn't acknowledged this and all of the people all of us who stayed up late and I August 22nd at 1 30 a.m. I can't I remember exactly when I pre-ordered this thing we got screwed badly and we don't know even if we're gonna get a SNES classic soon and I really and it's like my god somebody I I am with you a hundred percent active somebody needs to hold Amazon's feet to the fire on this so I don't know if I have journalist friends that listen to this show I know I have a couple but I don't know if they're listening to every episode every minute but if I have any journalist friends that have connections out there that are doing a story on this somebody needs to grill Amazon's PR department on how this happened and by the way something something to think about what else does Amazon own that's under the same umbrella with gaming twitch TV and one big thing that they're pushing on twitch right now is help us sell video games on twitch well I'm gonna ask this give twitch twitch if you want me to help you sell video games how are you gonna guarantee that you're actually gonna give them to people because you're all Amazon at the end of the day even though yes twitch is a different building than Amazon treasure truck and Amazon how are you gonna guarantee that the people I'm gonna push to buy things on and I say that as a twitch affiliate how are you going to make sure that the people that buy games on Amazon get them when they think they're gonna get them and when they're promised them that's exactly I would like to hear people asking of twitch yeah exactly there's there's tons of stuff going wrong with Amazon right now and especially with whether gaming pre-orders and all that stuff is and it's crazy that it isn't even like mentioned in any game journal or gaming blog out there because I have Church I'm I'm trying to look for answers to say to see if Amazon has said something that if anyone has already received their SNES classic but no we haven't seen anything and it's again frustrating because I ordered to one for me and one for a friend who lives in Mexico City mm-hmm and I really want that to have it right like as soon as possible because another friend of ours is going to Mexico City and I wouldn't have to pay for shipping yeah but if have to pay for shipping I would have to pay for importation fees the the shipping self and it's gonna be another 50 to more even more dollars that yeah we really don't want to spend well active for what it's worth I'm gonna cross my fingers and my toes tomorrow is Monday and if business things are gonna happen maybe Monday you'll get your answer you know it all went down on a Friday so maybe Monday Amazon will have some answers but if Amazon doesn't produce some answers on Monday then I would call on any of my folks with connections out there who do these stories where they get to interview Amazon or interview twitch ask these hard questions people like act deaf need you to ask these questions so all right my friend I'm gonna let you go and hope for the best for you okay hey thanks for having keep us posted we'll check in next week okay sure all right take care buddy all right I think that is gonna do it for the Skype line tonight I'm gonna definitely be watching his twitch to see if he gets that SNES classic or any of my friends that ordered on Amazon get their SNES classic but I think we're about to wrap up tonight's show that's it for another additional orange unless you had a last-minute story you wanna talk about our soccer I don't know I did find an interesting story about the in fact I actually reposted on my Jamie Summers fan page on Facebook if people would like to maybe give it a like but I posted about the resurgence of a pinball itself that after a sharp decline pinball has actually gone back into the rise with over 35,000 international tournaments so and then of course we have more and more machines being released and I it makes it makes my dark heart a little bit brighter to know that that's happening any any thoughts on why like why pinball is it just maybe just kind of the whole like nostalgia thing like I think a good bit of it is nostalgia I think the other thing comes with it actually being some sort of you know a tactile sensation it's it's a game that you are more directly interacting with whether it's you know you know shaking the table you know without tilting it right or catching the ball and doing tricks with it it requires I think a lot a higher degree of skill but anyone can pick it up you know in some ways you know we make we make fun of the whole pachinko machine craze in Japan sometimes about oh Castlevania is gonna be a pachinko machine and all this stuff but in a way in a way pinball is kind of what we have instead of pachinko yeah in a way I mean right because it's it's similar they had their origins in the same place exactly they have their oranges in the same place so you know and I think if if Konami were to say we're gonna make a Castlevania pinball game most people would be like fucking rad yeah yeah talk to Stern Stern's the one making them which by the way our coin op has a has Lexi light speed which that one is supposed to be it's really a first of its type it's a supposed to be a modular table that has a video play field so the interactive elements are when it hits a target it changes on the the play field it's full video and it was really fun and it's supposed to be able to be modded into other pinball tables so all right well I think on that note then we're gonna wrap up another additional orange laundry oh I want to thank you guys for listening to the show tonight really appreciate your as a support we are the show where every gamer has a voice but we can only spread those voices if they're here with us either live or via emails and tweets and all that stuff on the podcast feed tell a friend or two about the show help us spread the word about orange lounge radio that's all we ask really a nice five-star review on a site like iTunes or wherever you found this show those go a long way as well that's it I think it's time to do final thoughts tonight dark Sakura you want to go first your final thought tonight hell is other people no I mean I'm really okay it's just when you're dealing with mitigating issues between a bunch of people and then other people decide that oh we need you to stop everything in your actual real life and work on stuff 3,000 miles away please don't do that to me I can't do anything about that yeah so you're only one person and I may be awesome and cuter than Loki feel better Loki but no just just I need a day alone but I'm seeing gorillas this week there you go so fuck yeah all right so I have to say reject false icons fair enough my final thought tonight is I am going to bed early tonight I'm so tired but
