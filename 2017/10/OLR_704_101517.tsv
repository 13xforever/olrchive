90560	99840	Master Loki over there yes what you don't want more Legos no I I always want more Legos
99840	105320	is whether it's gonna happen how how many times have you stepped on a Lego brick barefoot
105320	108240	because we all know that's like one of the worst things that could possibly happen to
108240	112760	you it's not I used to walk on them so I mean it's fine so I found out this week that
112760	117540	Loki and I both like the same show I know we don't talk a lot about TVs and movies here
117540	121120	on OLR because you know we have other shows here at the voice geeks network where we do
121120	125160	tape live Sunday nights at six o'clock Pacific's nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby
125160	128220	Black Wolf show we have a lot of great shows here to talk about that stuff we don't really
128220	131860	get to talk about it here as much but I found out that you and I are both big fans of the
131860	136720	show called the good place yes it's a really funny show it is hilarious I started binge
136760	140960	watching I don't even know what made me do it I think I think just a lot of my friends are
140960	145120	talking about how funny it was as I was like all right it's like a 25 minute show I won't
145120	151040	take that long I like marathoned the first season in like two and a half days yeah we
151040	155280	ran out of episodes so yeah and there's only it's only on its second season so it's pretty
155280	159080	easy yeah it started second season yeah so I liked it a lot I thought it was really funny
159080	165400	so I don't want to spoil it too much well the the premise is that the main character who's
165400	171640	Kristen Bell who was Veronica Mars right but she's a little older now she she died and she
171640	177240	wakes up in the good place which is the opposite of the bad place so she would you know because
177240	181160	obviously I don't think the show wants to get too religious so it's about her you know adventures
181160	186440	in the good place and the people that she meets and the maybe not so good things that are happening
186440	190920	well yes in the main twist which they kind of reveal in the first episode is that she's not
190920	195880	really supposed to be there yeah it's a mistake yes yes that is in the first episode so he's not
195880	202960	really spoiling anything too crazy and so it's kind of her trying to fake it and you know try
202960	207600	to make it into you know this thing and then all sorts of crazy stuff happens yeah so who's your
207600	213200	favorite character because my favorite character on that whole show is Evil Janet pretty good I
213200	222720	I also like I can't remember his name the the dude that plays like the silent monk Oh
222720	230960	Johnny Johnny yeah yeah yes but yes it's true his trooper yes yes not to spoil anything but
230960	239240	yeah hisself itself yes I like how his interactions uh let's see I know it's John who was his name I
239240	244280	think John it was his name anyway I when I watch a show like that I can tie it see watch I can tie
244280	250520	anything back to video games because the way they present that the good place is kind of built is
250520	255800	that like there's this architect that creates the good place for a certain number of people it's
255800	262360	totally like the sims like I swear the people that invented that show probably thought how
262360	266640	could we turn the sims into a TV show like is it just me or does that does it feel like a lot
266800	275880	yeah yeah without all the like death traps and stuff yeah without all of that so I'm going to
275880	281840	chat over at live.vognetwork.com a couple people starting with a Kossen saying you can talk to me
281840	286080	about the Orville which I'm hearing a lot of good things about I haven't gotten around to that yet
286080	291640	because I've been watching Star Trek Discovery which you know I realize a lot of people are
291640	296800	watching Orville instead of Star Trek Discovery which cheap plug I did appear on starboard power
296800	302080	coupling this week so if you want to check out our synopsis of episode 4 go check out those kids
302080	306480	the starboard power coupling podcast which is part of vognetwork it's it's there under our podcast
306480	310160	course I got to get in the stranger thing season 2 when they come oh shit that's like only two
310160	314920	weeks away that's two weeks exciting and that's as we got into last week that's a game now too
315080	321800	yep it is dark soccer is there anything you're watching on the telly nope no I don't really
321800	325760	like TV but you've watched a few things like you guys watch the Castlevania anime which I still
325760	331320	need to do I watch things when they come out and then I get it over with yeah so I watched
331320	335560	stranger things I'm gonna watch the next season I watched Jessica Jones and I watched Luke Cage
335560	340400	and I watched Defenders okay and I tried to watch iron fist but it was completely fucking ridiculous
340400	346720	some stuff I'm not watching anything okay okay right now I see what you mean so like you you
346720	351720	wait and then you like binge it all at once and then it's done I get it okay oh the one thing I
351720	356200	am continuously watching every time an episode comes out is Dragon Ball super okay that's it
356200	361760	and you know I'll have RuPaul's Drag Race in January yeah so will you yeah I'll watch Drag
361760	367960	Race that one now no I know that's a lie if you're gonna try to tell me as for anything on TV right
367960	374520	now no I'm not watching anything I'm mostly a YouTube watcher so I watch the cuisine of the
374520	380040	18th century with James Townsend and son speaking of well sorry if I don't want to interrupt or
380040	384520	anything but I was gonna say speaking of YouTube actually one channel that's been putting out stuff
384520	389680	in the interim is awesome games done quick they do these little I don't know what they're called
389680	394000	but they're like small little turn it like tournament runs type that they're doing so
394000	401280	they did one the other day that was it's a link to the past randomizer and so what that means is
401280	408040	basically all the drops like the different items are randomized in the actual the Legend of Zelda
408040	413840	randomizer yes so they it's final fantasy randomizer like original NES Final Fantasy
413840	418120	randomizer and I think it's a similar concept yeah so that was kind of fun I watched that for
418120	422360	a good couple hours the other day but yeah they've been putting out content like almost once a week
422360	429960	but the other thing that I'm watching regularly on YouTube is outside Xbox mm-hmm which is a UK
429960	437160	like gaming top best-of list and they don't just stick to Xbox stuff I'm just saying that you know
437160	442520	it's really funny they have some good perspectives and I've actually picked up a few like I didn't
442520	447400	know the threshold trick in Mass Effect 2 where if you do when you're doing grunt's loyalty mission
447400	451520	there's a particular screw that you can stand behind and just shoot and shoot and shoot and
451560	458920	the thing can't hit you but you can hit it I know about that there you go I just go headfirst into
458920	462800	everything I always forget that YouTube is like a thing that people can like legitimately watch
462800	467400	shows on like it's a very different sort of thing and you'd think I'd be more aware because I've
467400	471760	always been very like rah rah rah do a podcast make a podcast so you'd think I'd be the same
471760	478000	way for YouTube and TV and I am but I just don't find that I have the time to sit down I watch
478040	484080	little things here and there but I don't get into a lot of series I also watch a lot of the NHK TV
484080	490480	shows so I mean I don't watch them regularly so I can't say I am watching them but I'll go through
490480	496160	just big bursts of watching like begin Japan ology or bento or was it called lunch on it's all about
496160	503840	bento and you know certain like arts and crafts shows I'm and I watch a lot of history stuff on
503880	511720	YouTube because I love fucking I love documentaries I love history I like documentaries too but like
511720	518640	more like socially based ones I don't watch a lot of like the history like wars and stuff I like the
518640	524800	social I like the history ones where they go into how events unfolded and affected people more of the
524800	531440	I guess combination of anthropology sociology and history so that because I think that if you don't
531480	537520	look at history through the lens of someone who experienced it then you can't see how it applies
537520	542880	to modern life and too many people don't want to look at history oh that was terrible it was a war
542880	547120	ba ba ba ba ba you know what I mean but when you look at it through the people's eyes what they
547120	554840	suffered and then we see what's happening today oh my god you will cry because fuck what's going
554920	561800	on right now I like watching it's totally trash but the internet historian on YouTube and he does
561800	568840	kind of documentary type features of trolling in memes and stuff and it's it's it's actually kind
568840	572560	of fascinating because it's stuff that I would have never heard about but they go into great
572560	579360	detail about stuff like balloon boy or you know dash con and all those weird stuff that they do
580080	587880	just I don't know it's pretty funny I mean it's it's trash because it's like these people are
587880	592800	trolling people right but it's it's entertaining to watch from an outside perspective right okay
592800	596880	well speaking I do want to mention real quick because I don't think it made our show world
596880	600000	tonight but I saw it floating around out there because you brought up awesome games done quick
600000	606800	yeah the schedule is out for the next awesome games done quick which would be the winter one
606800	612240	in a couple mad why are you mad well disappointed why is that because Super Metroid isn't on the
612240	617360	last Super Metroid I don't know if that's about whatever happened you know last year but I'm also
617360	623720	disappointed because our pal and friend of the show Flaco Jones submitted for PT and again sadly
623720	627520	did not get in but you know they got a lot of talented people I was looking because they
627520	632640	actually have posted like what they accepted and what they rejected oh my god like there's a lot I
632640	637040	mean it's no wonder Flaco is submitted several times it keeps getting bumped because there's
637040	641040	just tons of stuff that gets submitted maybe they can do another one three times a year so many
641040	646480	speedrunners out there for sure maybe he can do his own marathon for charity and donate it to the
646480	651280	awesome games done quick actually I would I would love to see you know I know we've been talking
651280	655680	about it for a long time and maybe we're gonna need some help from some people that are better
655680	663040	event planners than we are such as the folk that folks that do sack gamer collective I believe is
663040	667200	the new name you know our pals over there because especially with all the wildfires that's been
667200	670600	going on here in Northern California I'd really love to see I don't know if you guys know but
670600	677360	like an old friend of the show DDR angel she was like luckily last I heard everything's okay but I
677360	680840	know like her life got turned upside down by the evacuations and all that stuff and I'm sure she's
680840	685200	not the only one that we know of that listens to the show that's that's really run into a problem
685240	688880	so it'll be really cool if we can kind of do something to help because it's been you know
688880	692960	even here in Sacramento I mean we're fine guys we're like a hundred miles from everything but
692960	698040	like the air has been toxic here like I kind of have to stay indoors it's fine today but I mean
698040	702260	like Monday Tuesday we're it's still hazy though yeah so I mean did you see from San Francisco as
702260	709440	well oh yeah it was pretty terrible I just like the post that's not fog yeah this time um but the
709760	717280	I do well Dan has worked done a marathon for Child's Play before and we've got all the stuff
717280	722880	set up at my house that we could stream okay so all we have to do is just set up an account for
722880	729240	donations and then donate the whole thing to whichever charity is handling the wildfires it
729240	732960	wouldn't be that hard yeah we'll figure something out maybe hopefully in the coming months because
732960	738120	you know it's not like the needs are gonna go away in two months so we'll see what we can do
738120	745200	so and all else fails there are charities lots of worthy causes I'm associated with one so yeah
745200	749200	anyway I did want to mention in chat real quick because I think this is a good point over at live
749200	754220	dot vog network comm Bobby black wolf who's on before us says in chat we all know super
754220	759080	Metroid will be a donation incentive so there is that maybe we don't know the the final final
759080	765400	answers yet so that's a that's good Brad from pod culture says 24 hours of vog game streaming
765400	771640	I'm sure there's enough of us I hey even if we raised a hundred bucks I'd be thrilled that's
771640	776720	a hundred bucks they didn't have before so you know if it's a small turnout who cares you don't
776720	781160	do it for the size of turnout you do it for the the donations and awareness even if it's just a
781160	786400	little awareness so all right well anyhow I do want to get into some other gaming content and
786400	789400	some of the news would talk about at the top of the show because I know we went on some nerd
789400	794920	tangents but it's been I don't think we have a lot a lot of news tonight but of course I say that
794960	801200	and those are the four-hour shows so let's kick off tonight's talking about loot boxes because it
801200	806440	seems like just in general the concept of loot boxes has been in the news a lot especially this
806440	811600	seems to be getting worse and what if the problem here's what it is is a lot of people dismiss loot
811600	816840	boxes as oh it's cosmetic oh this and that right we've been seeing lately with a lot of games that
816840	824080	they're specifically creating these games to push loot boxes or they're taking aspects of the game
824080	829600	out to put them in loot boxes because they can make extra money and loot boxes are finding like
829600	834480	a free-to-play game or even fine like I even I don't blame overwatch too much because that is
834480	841440	just cosmetic stuff well I I kind of think that overwatch is the reason everybody's course of
841440	847480	course watch wasn't the first bite but like blizzard fans are like I'm trying to think of
847480	854000	a tactful way to say this but blizzard fans are different than a lot of other types of gamers and
854000	858460	I say that having done a World of Warcraft podcast for several years which you guys all know
858460	863120	Hoard House was on the network okay so I was a part of that community and it's a great community
863120	869000	I'm not talking negative at all I'm just saying that the blizzard fans are very loyal to blizzard
869000	875160	products and when blizzard does this is why I realized that even though not everybody gets it
875160	880200	like why destiny 2 is in the battle net launcher it's a brilliant move by Activision to sell more
880200	884960	destiny 2 on PC to an audience that probably didn't check it out on console I mean I'm I'm
884960	889440	sorry you may not like totally understand that but the way the the blizzard crowd is if they
889440	895500	can spend the money that they're making on gold in World of Warcraft or what have you on destiny
895500	900120	to another game they're gonna do it so like that was that was a move that was frankly brilliant by
900120	907440	Activision I mean whether it's not the nice thing to do or not but anyway Activision's been aggressive
907440	913120	pretty bad with this stuff and not only me even before destiny 2 with Call of Duty modern warfare
913120	917880	remastered they just injected loot boxes in there it's like that what the fuck the original game
917880	923480	didn't have that and now of course I'm assuming with the new Call of Duty and with advanced
923480	929840	warfare I think even has that system shadow of war was a pretty big one that they just kind of
929840	934360	added this up in there and then of course the one that released Italy got people pissed off
934360	939480	it will force up the new force the game has that which is more of like a pay-to-earn type scheme
939480	944680	but then the more of a pay-to-win type scheme with battlefront 2 member valve for it too they're like
944680	949080	oh hey yeah we're gonna release all these maps for free it's you're not gonna we're not just gonna
949080	954240	sell you really shitty base game and then force you to buy all the maps now we're gonna offer it
954240	959240	to you for free but of course then they're gonna throw in this loot box system that's got a lot of
959240	963680	mods that actually do affect gameplay you know something if you actually level up and that is
963680	970360	actually I believe the system to level up in the game is tied to the loot boxes so it's unavoidable
970360	979160	that's really really similar to overwatch overwatch does the free maps the free characters and as you
979160	985480	level up you get loot box no I it's the other way around oh you don't level up get loot boxes you
985480	990560	have to get loot boxes to level oh that's that's a little yeah that's like a little what can we
990560	995120	change to be a little shadier and okay interesting so I do want to get some comments in our shower
995120	999400	because I know you have some news like why are we bringing this up tonight loot boxes are nothing
999400	1004280	new in the gaming community but there's definitely some activity we're seeing this week but I want to
1004280	1009320	get to our chat over at live dot vog network comm a stoppie and chat says I used to have no opinion
1009320	1013800	on it but yes I'm seeing a lot of instances now where content seems to be cut out and held hostage
1013800	1021480	in loot boxes let's see Carson says I like the loot boxes that do boxed CE and LE version of
1021480	1027040	PC games but they're too expensive for me dungeon buster says loot boxes are just extensions of the
1027040	1033680	mobile model thanks mobile gaming kaijuto and chat says the reason why they only do cosmetic
1033680	1039920	is because we don't like pay-to-win look at what's going on with 2k 18 loot boxes have been going
1039920	1045600	around since we had browser games but it certainly does feel like you know browser games I think are
1045600	1049680	kind of one thing because browser games are free to play mobile games are free to play right but
1049680	1057360	overwatch was $60 yeah that's not even this and it's not well oh right I know I'm only picking on
1057360	1062040	a watch no watch is a good example because I think it's done correctly I don't think there's
1062040	1067400	really an issue there because it's it is strictly cosmetic for me I don't give a shit about the
1067400	1070640	cosmetic stuff so it's it's cool to get one every now and then it's like oh that's a pretty cool
1070640	1075680	skin I'm not like oh man I really got it like but you know there's people that are like that
1075680	1081000	but there are kind of on them right and wait how you choose to spend your money which if you want
1081000	1085160	to buy a hundred loot boxes so you can get that symmetric dragon skin well hey it is a pretty
1085160	1092840	sweet skin but with that though I mean there's definitely been a lot of people that have been
1092840	1097480	opposed to it because yeah it is something that's kind of out that whole free-to-play model but you
1097480	1103320	paid $60 for the game and then because it's not really the full game because you need all the DLC
1103320	1108440	because that's been sliced out of the game as well so you to pay for the season pass as well
1108440	1115320	and then they want you to pay for these loot boxes or paid modifications as Bethesda likes
1115320	1122600	to do with you oh hey this modification is it happens to be 800 you know virtual currency
1122600	1126760	points or whatever but you can only buy the currency points in 750 so you really have to
1126760	1134320	spend $15 you get to get this other thing it it's just they tried to like cheat people in the best
1134320	1138680	way possible because they they know they make money and they know well these fans of the game
1138680	1143840	they're just gonna they're gonna be fine with it because it's just okay though they'll be annoyed
1143840	1148560	but they'll still buy the game and yeah that seems to be the case with a lot of like destiny
1148560	1155840	2 players they're fine with it because they the game is good but you know the loot boxes are still
1155840	1161120	there attempting people miss dark Sakura over there in the fluffy chair I'm curious on your
1161120	1165440	hot take on loot boxes because I know you don't really do overwatch but you have done mobile
1165440	1170360	games you've done Mass Effect had him yeah Dragon Age had him so what's your hot take on loot boxes
1170360	1174640	are you okay with them are you kind of I'm okay that I don't multiplayer that much in overwatch
1174640	1178520	makes me sick so it's not my problem right but what about the other games you do play that have
1178520	1183560	them what games do I play that have those effects I don't do multiplayer in it anymore okay and I
1183560	1189060	never did multiplayer in Dragon Age okay so okay I thought you kind of did more loot boxes back when
1189060	1193440	like Mass Effect 3 was I did it for Mass Effect 3 but I didn't pay for any of them it's not always
1193440	1198440	multiplayer games either shadow of war and granted it has a multiplayer aspect to it but right it's
1198440	1205120	in the single-player right well she doesn't have needed to be fair neither do I yeah I none of this
1205120	1210160	it doesn't matter to me okay I mean the only loot boxes I care about is the Pusheen loot crate oh
1210160	1218080	you mean physical loot box right well this tangible stuff you know what actually let's talk about that
1218080	1224480	because doesn't this phenomenon kind of exists in the real world any no okay any convention I go
1224480	1231160	to any of them always have for sale those little question mark bricks that for like 20 bucks and
1231160	1236720	they say two of them have a NES classic or something really highly desirable in them the
1236720	1242640	rest of them have bullshit unload overstock stuff but because it's nerd stuff nobody really gets
1242640	1247240	upset because they're like okay yeah that's like a raffle or gambling it's an I am Groot ruler
1248240	1257440	something you know it's oh I needed a ruler but yeah I mean so there's been a lot of like kind of
1257440	1262280	pushback with loot boxes because of all I mean recently there's just been a ton of games tons
1262280	1267120	of big games coming out of it all have them and all kind of unnecessarily have them basically so
1267120	1271600	what's some of the stuff going around this week if you don't mind so of course you know they've
1271760	1278640	turned to the different ratings boards to kind of get their hot take on it as well the ESRB says
1278640	1286000	you know they don't consider loot boxes to be gambling they just you know it's because I think
1286000	1292640	mainly you don't actually you know win money from it you they don't see it as something of like
1292640	1298320	value you're not really like it's it's not the same format as gambling basically they say yes
1298320	1302680	our B does not consider loot boxes to be gambling while there is an element of chance in these
1302680	1307480	mechanics the player is always guaranteed to receive in-game content even if the player
1307480	1312760	unfortunately receives something they don't want we think of it as a similar principle to a
1312760	1317480	collectible card game sometimes you open a pack and get brand new holographic card you had your
1317480	1321480	eye on for a while but other times you'll end up with a pack of cards you already have so they're
1321480	1326320	saying that because you get something each time it's not really considered gambling I think they
1326320	1331080	make a darn good point with the fact that magic the gathering isn't considered a gambling and it's
1331080	1337240	a similar type of deal yeah I can support that I mean you're right like you can't turn around and
1337240	1342120	sell you know Blizzard walked away from that Diablo 3 auction house a long time ago and they
1342120	1345160	don't really have anything like that in any of their other games maybe if something like that
1345160	1350800	still existed and I mean I know Diablo 3 doesn't do loot boxes but let's make believe it did you
1350800	1355440	know then maybe that would be gambling because you could turn around and sell the stuff that you get
1355480	1360920	in the blue boxes that doesn't exist to be clear that doesn't exist but could could could it in five
1360920	1365960	years is that like is that how we're gonna get out of it comp being gambling is that you're saying
1365960	1372920	that you always get something well you know what if what you get is essentially worthless it it is
1372920	1379640	it is a game of chance but it's not gambling there's a difference again magic the gathering
1379640	1385440	isn't gambling right so and you know but but that analogy is absolutely right in magic the
1385440	1390480	gathering you're not gonna get Sarah Angel it's like the one card I can't remember the name of
1390480	1394880	you're not gonna get a Sarah Angel every booster pack just because you want one in fact you might
1394880	1399440	buy like some of my friends did in high school that we all played you might buy 20 packs trying
1399440	1406520	to get a hypnotic specter oh no that I did am I have my nailing these carny has been a long time
1406720	1412040	I just don't originate or sitting there screaming or a shivin dragon my magic knowledge is is in the
1412040	1419760	pooper or you know back in the black border days oh I got a Lotus let me did you play like a black
1419760	1424440	I bet you played like a black deck black like my tournament deck was a black deck with Lord of the
1424440	1431520	Pit and hypnotic specters I had a black white and red deck my tournament deck I found out I played
1431520	1437440	it just to find out that it actually got banned the next tournament oh shoot I made it like fourth
1437440	1443960	place okay all right well there you go see we and we weren't gambling at all all right and then of
1443960	1447720	course Peggy they have their approach you know basically saying our approach is similar that of
1447720	1455360	the SRB I think all ratings board do you SK in Germany as well the main reason is for that we
1455360	1459960	cannot define what constitutes gambling that is the responsibility of the National Gambling
1459960	1465160	Commission our gambling content descriptor is given to games that simulate or teach gambling
1465160	1470740	as it's done in real life casinos racetracks etc have Gambling Commission were to state that loop
1470740	1476200	boxes are a form of gambling then we would have to adjust our criteria to that interesting so this
1476200	1481780	is about the advisory and why a game like Vegas Stakes on the Super Nintendo let's say because I
1481780	1484960	don't know why but it's the first casino game that comes to my mind probably because it's still one
1484960	1490640	of the best of this day Vegas Stakes would get a gambling warning because if you remember that
1490640	1496000	game it was about you actually played blackjack you played crap what were the games in that it
1496000	1500320	was like blackjack craps slot machine I remember they were like fuck you know maybe it was like
1500320	1503720	five games in there I remember that was the one where like random people would come up to you
1503720	1506560	while you're playing the game and there would be like the little like that's what kind of made it
1506560	1510560	unique is that there'd be the little like they'd say oh can you help me by giving me a hundred
1510560	1515240	dollars or whatever and sometimes they'd it was that was gambling too sometimes you'd they'd come
1515240	1518880	back or they'd run away forever you never see the money again sometimes they'd be like I won a
1518880	1522440	lottery and thing and I'm gonna give you part of the prize because you helped me and you made more
1522440	1528280	money you remember that game no anyone Jamie you know the old classic games very well Vegas Stakes
1528280	1532080	Super Nintendo remember that I didn't play it I swear to God next time you're gone classic I don't
1532080	1538340	I don't like gambling really so being that you know the ESRB and Peggy can't really rule on it
1538340	1545180	some other sites have taken to make a more you know apparent approach against this basically saying
1545180	1550860	listen we're gonna take a stand against this we're not really you know for it let's make a way that
1550860	1555820	we can make people aware of this so one of those sites that's taking aim at this is open critic
1555820	1563660	and they're actually looking into ways that they can basically display what kind of loot boxes are
1563660	1568980	in a game your weather game has loot boxes you know if it's pay to win that type of stuff what
1568980	1573700	about the whole thing and I know you don't really have an answer for this but I know a couple months
1573700	1578180	ago on the show we were talking about how China was pushing an issue where because you know
1578180	1584620	overwatch is doing well there too but China was gonna make them publish what the percentage was
1584620	1589940	of rare because we kind of don't know like what the percentage is like what is the chance that
1589940	1595780	you're gonna get symmetrous dragon skin you don't know like you just know that sometimes rare stuff
1595780	1600540	shows up but China was gonna make them publish the numbers but then I think I heard that recently
1600540	1607700	blizzard found a way around it like they now you buy currency in the game and that's all you're
1607700	1612380	spending money on you use the currency to get loot boxes or something like that like they're able
1612380	1617020	they're able to get around they got around it somehow in China exactly we still don't know what
1617020	1621580	those rates they were the making sort of gambling laws regarding loot boxes they would just change
1621580	1626540	the way that they're doing so they can skirt around them so that's one site at least that's
1626540	1630780	looking to do that but let me let me ask you this let me ask you this hard question and everybody in
1630780	1636540	chat as well would you base your decision on if you're gonna buy a game or not on whether it has
1636540	1640620	loot boxes and I asked that to our chat as well live fog network calm while I asked Loki and
1640620	1646740	depends what kind of blue boxes if it's gonna be like you know overwatch where it's just cosmetic
1646740	1652060	stuff for multiplayer then yeah I'm fine with that if it's something that's gonna be basically
1652060	1659980	heavily involved in the game like shadow war or Forza or you know some of these that have basically
1659980	1665220	in one game you've had it you know as a feature now it's a consumable and you that features gone
1665220	1669880	because it's locked behind loot boxes where it seems like a you know massive cash grab from the
1669880	1675500	publisher then no I probably would avoid the game just fucking wait for Nintendo to decide they're
1675500	1680980	gonna start doing loot boxes I guess I kind of do they in the mobile games I I bet this
1680980	1685540	Animal Crossing mobile does loot boxes just you wait that's fine once again that's yeah
1685540	1692140	it's a free game you know what you're you're paying nothing for the game they can throw
1692140	1696700	whatever the fuck they want at you I mean honestly that's it's my that's my opinion if if it's a free
1696700	1702060	game you're playing you're losing nothing if you quit that game it's it the problem comes to like
1702060	1705900	if it's Super Mario Odyssey and everything is locked behind a loot box then I'm gonna be
1705900	1710820	fucking pissed because I paid $60 for the game so this metacritic or open critic or whatever was
1710820	1718700	you said was looking at the advisories they need to probably clarify what kind of loot box it is
1718700	1722060	besides just putting out a loot box warning like there because there's a difference between
1722060	1729360	cosmetic only loot boxes and or if it's like a loot box that's in you know with in-game currency
1729400	1733760	that you earn in the game you don't pay real money for dungeon buster just brought that up in our
1733760	1738540	chat room saying the new Assassin's Creed game has that you can buy them but you can also use
1738540	1741720	in-game currency and they've been very clear to say you can use in-game currency to buy the loot
1741720	1748200	boxes right well that's you can do that and I think shadow war as well but you know of course
1748200	1754720	they're gonna make the in-game currency hard to get and you know take forever and yeah tiger
1754720	1759280	call on chat says these so-called loot boxes seem to only apply to multiplayer games you won't see
1759280	1764440	loot boxes on single-player games was that the well shadow or the shadow war technically does
1764440	1770320	have a multiplayer portion but the the thing though is most of that is meant for the single
1770320	1774760	player game like in the end of the game it's very grindy and that's where that comes into play but
1774760	1780160	yeah it just so happened me most games nowadays are they have a multiplayer portion to them right
1780160	1784200	so it's gonna be hard to find a game that doesn't but like some of the games that they mentioned
1784200	1790400	NBA 2k 18 has them you know I remember Oh Bobby Blackwell says fours of seven has loot boxes a
1790400	1795160	single player yes so maybe this trend is yeah continuing and some folks in chat you know Rama
1795160	1799360	dungeon buster both saying no this would not influence their decision dungeon buster elaborating
1799360	1804500	I don't like the trend is represented in battlefront 2 but not all games implement loot box rewards the
1804500	1810960	same way so hmm and dungeon buster saying I've been playing shadow of war and have not opened a
1810960	1818000	single loot box I agreed but not checkmarked the legal agreement at the start interesting okay so
1818000	1822040	I mean and to be fair I can't really judge the loot boxes and shadow war because I'm not playing
1822040	1826480	that game oh yeah they said that most of the game you don't really need you know the loot boxes are
1826480	1830800	really you can use them but it's not gonna be like super important it's just towards the end
1830800	1835640	of the game the endgame stuff that to get the true ending you're gonna really need to level
1835640	1841160	your characters because it's really hard to defeat the last or you know stave off the last
1841160	1847920	few raids or whatever and that's where it becomes more tempting to get the true ending so speaking
1847920	1854720	of loot boxes now we had some continued development and shadow of war actually right so now this is
1854720	1859480	one of those things that doesn't surprise me how the player base is responded right Loki yes so
1859480	1864720	of course you know with anything that people don't like they're gonna hack it they're gonna mod it so
1864720	1871640	that's what happened apparently they have found a way to get loads of the Mirian which I guess is
1871640	1879880	the in-game currency to keep buying loot chests forever and so I guess there's I'm using like
1879880	1887440	just basic programs like the cheat engine allow you to get the in-game currency so that's not
1887440	1896000	unexpected hackers gonna hack no patch it over put some anti-cheat yeah isn't the economy or
1896000	1901320	whatever you want to call it like already kind of hosed I'm really surprised it is like because
1901320	1906240	blizzard somehow seems to have never had this happen but I would assume like blizzard games
1906240	1910240	pretty much at this point have to always be connected that's the other thing about blizzard
1910240	1914840	games blizzard breaks all these rules that you'd like you know oh the community is never gonna
1914840	1920280	allow that our community's gonna push back on this blizzard gets away with it every every damn
1920280	1930680	time blizzards up on that stage Oh Diablo 3 you're so beautiful right you're a model but you look
1930680	1937280	like Linda eventually stuff right exactly problem with Diablo 3 beam online only I mean when the
1937280	1943800	servers weren't working but there's so how long did that last how long did that last people give
1943800	1949800	we forgave and forget we forgave I forgot the the auction house controversy and maybe I'm part
1949800	1957240	of the problem I love Diablo 3 now I love it now this is just online passes all over again because
1957240	1962040	they're gonna make the excuse that we need extra money to run our games up you know what you make
1962040	1966480	tons of money because you're not paying your fucking employees enough you're not paying you
1966480	1971920	know the royalties to people that like they would get in other industries so stop fucking complain
1972640	1977880	mm-hmm and to be fair to blizzard I think and I think this is important to say ask somebody who
1977880	1981760	is a blizzard fan and plays a lot of blizzard games I think part of the reason they get away
1981760	1988600	with like overwatch is always online and there's really nothing you can do about it is because they
1988600	1995520	make fucking quality aims like blizzard doesn't really make bad games at least not my opinion I
1995520	2000200	mean they misfired with Diablo 3 but they did what they had to do to fix it you know what I mean like
2000200	2004760	that's that's how blizzard gets away with it so just you know to be clear blizzard gets away with
2004760	2009840	it because they make fucking rock-solid games everybody wants to play so anyway is there
2009840	2014040	anything else on loot box I thought we have one other little tidbit no that was it oh is it okay
2014040	2022240	well there you go so yeah loot boxes in games there you go I think we will move on into our
2022240	2028480	gaming weeks but first a little I'll do housekeeping first real fast we are not going to be here and
2028480	2032040	actually my co-hosts are gonna hear this for the first time but I've been saying this for a couple
2032040	2036040	weeks that we probably won't be here Veterans Day weekend we're definitely not gonna be here
2036040	2039600	Veterans Day weekend because I am definitely going to be out of town so Alan and I decided
2039600	2047080	we're gonna go Seattle cuz we want to it like Southwest had a big sale so we got tickets like
2047080	2052400	80 bucks to Seattle so why not that's pretty good right it's a pretty good price right we were
2052400	2056040	looking at some other places but it was still a lot of money for Chicago and I think we're looking
2056120	2060360	at Vegas and but Seattle was like dirt cheap so we're like let's do it we we went to Seattle for
2060360	2063760	our five-year anniversary we had a great time so and I know a couple people up there so we'll go
2063760	2067560	back and do some of the stuff we didn't do the first time so there you go so for that reason we
2067560	2073880	will not be having a show Veterans Day weekend and that is November 13th I think cuz veterans
2073880	2078680	do we live why oh no we fly back on the 13th November 12th is the date of the show so no show
2078680	2082960	that day all right we're gonna move in to our gaming weeks and talking about the types of games
2083000	2086920	we have been playing this week dark soccer stepped out for just a moment so I'll go ahead and start
2086920	2091240	with Loki and how was your gaming week I didn't play too much unfortunately because I had planned
2091240	2098240	to play a bunch of things but I once again am still stuck with being obsessed with Legos and
2098240	2102520	not necessarily building Legos I've been actually doing stuff when one of the why started with a
2102520	2109240	Lego digital designer and then I moved on to this other program called stud I O which allows you to
2109240	2113480	manipulate things a little bit better than the Lego digital designer because they don't let you
2113480	2118080	just drop bricks in there in certain ways so I was been messing with that but I did play some games
2118080	2123440	I picked up because I've been checking like we have a target near or by and so they always have
2123440	2127560	stuff in clearance like the other day I didn't pick it up because I already have enough instruments
2127560	2134640	at home they had Guitar Hero the new one with a guitar it's like 20 bucks oh shoot yeah we're
2134640	2140120	at Target like yeah the Rancho shit I might go buy that it wasn't there last time I went there
2140120	2146080	last but last time I went there they had well one of the games I did pick up this week so I haven't
2146080	2150640	played it yet but I've been getting more VR games so I picked up they had a couple things digitally
2150640	2156880	on sale so I got the PlayStation worlds game because that was selling to like 10 bucks and
2156880	2166440	then I also picked up oh god what was the other one there's another VR game that drive club VR
2166440	2170720	because I think that was also down like 10 bucks so I picked those up and digitally and then Eagle
2170720	2177880	flight which is that weird Ubisoft game they had it for $12 so I picked that up as well because it
2177880	2184080	looks fun so they had that I was mainly looking for because they're closing at one time the Lego
2184080	2188360	dimension stuff and I wanted to get some of those sets cuz they're down like five I still need to
2188360	2192880	get that Midway set before it disappears I really want yeah it's gonna be hard to find I mean I saw
2192880	2199160	it in a store not that long ago I did see the Toys R Us and they had him at the Targon sunrise
2199160	2204480	if I remember correctly okay I because I look at that stuff every time I go in how can you not
2204480	2208120	well yeah cuz I'm like because they've been marking them down like occasionally I'll see
2208120	2214320	deals it like $1 I'm like oh damn I want that so there's like a routine so you know our pal
2214320	2217760	Shane my pal Shane that I hang out with all the time who hosts a show here on the network
2217760	2222480	called Ranger pride they're on a little hiatus right now but they'll be back Shane likes to go
2222480	2226120	and if you listen to Ranger pride you know he likes to go looking for all the toys right so
2226120	2230440	sometimes he'll con me into going on a toy hunt because it'll be like well let's just go on a toy
2230440	2233440	hunt that will do lunch or something like that and so you know we'll have ourselves a fun Saturday
2233440	2238040	morning so we have a routine like we go to Toys R Us and we look for the Power Ranger thing he's
2238040	2243560	looking for and then we always go we look at amiibos we look at video games like we just have a like
2243560	2248600	a habit of all the sections in the store any stuff mark down I almost picked up they had some of the
2248600	2253320	Finding Dory stuff there and I was like man my kids would really like that but we have too many
2253320	2257040	of those figures they don't play the game and my wife would be pissed if I pick more these up so
2257040	2261880	I'm like yeah I'm just gonna not yeah they don't play it you send them to Bobby Blackwell if he
2261880	2266760	plays but I knew they had a Doris if I hadn't seen it in any of the stores and now they have it there
2266760	2273680	you go yeah go ahead and pick it up anything else for your gaming week um just the usual clicker
2273680	2278280	game although I'm starting to get very tired of it so I don't know how long we continue with that
2278280	2285920	I mean I Pokemon go maybe a thing they'll be start up again for a little bit but yeah I'm just like
2285920	2290320	it's gotten to be more of like a chore and it's just there's like no point to it anymore I just
2290320	2296480	kind of yeah why am I wasting my time with this well I'll lead it to my gaming week that and say
2296680	2302080	I've been playing a little Pokemon go uh I don't I don't I don't view it as a chore like well I will
2302080	2306240	say this like you know the one thing I want to do in Pokemon go and I think you kind of have to
2306240	2311000	choose like what are your goals and Pokemon go do you want to raid gyms all the day and control
2311000	2316040	the gyms do you want you know to collect all the Pokemon and level them all up or what so I really
2316040	2320800	want to fill out the pokey decks right so right now in Pokemon go this month is where the anti
2320800	2327320	raids are happening which one of the legendaries but like it is like the raiding activity has died
2327320	2334480	off significantly from when it was the legendary birds and from when it was Raikou last month now
2334480	2340520	I'm not saying Pokemon go is dead but Pokemon go is certainly not what it was over the summer or
2340520	2346800	even just taking a nap it's it's yeah siesta a little siesta I'd say it's probably like dropping
2346800	2353960	off faster as it goes long instead of it kind of taking a while to kind of dip it's going a lot
2353960	2358640	faster so I was legit worried like I was not gonna find a group to get an Entei and I have a little
2358640	2362800	chat we use a chat program called group me for some of the local people here and so usually when
2362800	2368840	raids happen and last month like raids every day every night this month once in a while but like
2368840	2373080	they don't happen every day so and I'm not available every day so I have to be careful
2373240	2379160	sometimes so we tried to go do something a couple nights ago I didn't get Entei on the first go but
2379160	2384640	today we went to a local park over here that has two gyms and by coincidence they both had Entei
2384640	2389880	at the same time and so we got to do two Entei raids back-to-back and I did catch an Entei at
2389880	2394480	one of those raids so and it was like this big sigh of relief like whew I'm not gonna miss it
2394480	2400280	because I was so next month my lesson is learned I need to be out there day one which is what that's
2400280	2406440	gonna be like Halloween to go out and get the ice dog or I can't remember the name as something
2406440	2410200	but the ice dog I have to go up make sure I go out get day one because that's gonna be the easiest
2410200	2415600	day to do it so I was get a little worried but you know I still Pokemon go is still a good way
2415600	2422160	to gamify my walks like Fitbit kind of gamifies a lot with walking Pokemon go kind of does that
2422160	2427160	because it's like oh I can hatch eggs and I still you know I could still make some good Dragonite
2427520	2432560	you know use candy for things there's things and eggs you get a lot of stardust from that so it's
2432560	2437680	kind of like you know I'm not like obsessed with Pokemon go but it's a nice little distraction and
2437680	2443240	incentivizer for me to make sure I get up on my lunch and actually walk outside the building as
2443240	2447840	opposed to sit and play on the internet the entire lunch in my office and then whoops lunch is over
2447840	2451880	and I got to get back to work you know it's a nice way to make sure like I get out and get moving so
2452720	2458800	yeah so I have some I have been playing a little bit of Pokemon go guys you know in chat over at
2458800	2464560	live.vog network.com says it's in trouble because players know the Russians used it to hack our
2464560	2471720	election I how would they've used it to hack our election I don't remember what the story was but
2471720	2479440	I think it was something about people naming their Pokemon to certain controversial terms and putting
2479440	2484640	them in gyms and then taking pictures of it and spreading it on Facebook but I don't want to get
2484640	2489520	heavy into politics but the reality is it ain't just Pokemon go they were messing with to try to
2489520	2494860	influence the election we'll leave it at that I think I think that almost speaks to I know I
2494860	2500960	based my election choices but on the names of Pokemon and gyms I I think that just speaks
2500960	2507840	volumes about what a cultural phenomenon Pokemon go even was I mean think about it how many video
2507880	2515360	games since Polybus have you heard about a government conspiracy to change our way of life
2515360	2522880	like it's been a while so anyway yeah that's what it was thank you Bobby Bobby's kind of echoing
2522880	2526200	what I'm saying they didn't hack the app itself but it was an ad campaign with people naming their
2526200	2532520	pokemons anyway other comments on Pokemon go and chat SSG100Matt says we had 30 people rating for
2532520	2536480	an Entei at a random mall in Connecticut we were shocked because this mall was in the middle of
2536480	2541000	nowhere okay so maybe my 30 people in Connecticut that's not bad so maybe my experience is
2541000	2547040	different let's hit Bobby Black Wolf jokes about Pokemon go it fainted and it will never wake back
2547040	2554680	up ever it didn't faint it might be down to like five hit points been faint other games I've been
2554680	2560240	playing besides Pokemon go so I did a live stream of cuphead after the show last week and that was
2560240	2567280	a lot of fun like it is it is a I love the art style the music the way the game feels like it's
2567280	2572600	a solid platformer like I Jamie if you and Dan checked out Cuphead cuz I really feel like you
2572600	2576600	guys haven't had a chance yet okay yeah I definitely at some point check it out I mean it's
2576600	2582320	it's infuriatingly hard but like just I think you're gonna love like the art style of the
2582320	2586040	presentation following it for a long time oh yeah it's been chatting with the developers from time
2586240	2590880	to time on Twitter oh fun yeah yeah no um it's been on my list for a while it's just right now
2590880	2596640	I'm still working on the convention guide for derpy con so that's been taking my spare time there
2596640	2599520	you go I'll check on you with your full game a week in a minute let me let me finish up real quick
2599520	2606560	so also uh let's see dungeon buster says you did great at cuphead Rob yeah thank you I did I I beat
2606560	2614080	the tutorial so I got through that and I beat a few of the bosses on stream so um you know I I am
2614080	2620520	allowed to continue to do a video game podcast I suppose after that but all that crap I'm saying
2620520	2624880	that very tongue-in-cheek here's the funny thing about that you guys might get a kick out of this
2624880	2630160	so I decided because I felt like that was a really good stream because I actually had a generous
2630160	2634800	twitch person put like 86 viewers on me at one point so like I had quite a few people watching
2634800	2638720	at the end so I feel like all that energy and a lot of people watching made it a really fun stream
2638720	2643680	so I was like you know I don't do this with a lot of my streams I'm gonna put this one on YouTube so
2643680	2647120	if you want to see the archive of the stream you can see it either on my twitch or you can see it
2647120	2652440	on YouTube you know I waited 24 hours you have to do and then I put it up here's the hilarious part
2652440	2657640	so within two days my YouTube has like 10 views because I wrote a tweet about it and 10 people
2657640	2664640	clicked it and it gets flagged for copyright infringement by this company and I don't even
2664640	2669920	remember the name of it was something like EBC maker EBCD makers only that was like what is I
2669920	2673440	tried to google it I couldn't find anything I searched for tweets about it and there was only
2673440	2679160	one other guy going these guys flagged my video and I was about to go off on YouTube and this whole
2679160	2685680	cuz here here we go this whole thing where the people that make the videos just fucking get
2685680	2689360	screwed by these people that come in and have no right to do so but I was like all right before
2689360	2694440	you go off check what the rules on Cuphead are so I was doing my research and sure enough studio
2694440	2700200	MDHR or whoever sorry if I messed up the acronym but the studio that made Cuphead has a page that
2700200	2705600	very specifically says yes stream the games put the games on YouTube make money off them we don't
2705600	2711480	care get it out there you know so I I filed an appeal I said oh hell no I filed an appeal I linked
2711480	2717800	to that YouTube and so forth I will give YouTube credit when I sent my appeal they re-enabled the
2717800	2723840	video right away and I think that's a change from what it was before so and it said the claimants
2723880	2731760	have 30 days to respond and after a day the claim disappeared I never got an email saying that oh
2731760	2738760	they accepted it or whatever but I fought the law and I won and it feels good early so far knock
2738760	2744040	on wood but so far it's completely the claim is completely disappeared from my account so yeah
2744040	2748680	take that I think if you counter then they the next step is they have to file an actual lawsuit
2748680	2752840	or something yeah they don't own it so like but it's like they're not going to who the hell is
2752840	2757920	this company and I'm like you know if the if the Cuphead studio had a page that said do not post
2757920	2762380	the videos and monetize them I would have said well I don't have I don't have monetization anyway
2762380	2771160	because my YouTube channel has 9960 views so I'm like just shy of 10,000 I had it at one point but
2771160	2775640	I got turned away or whatever when they when they put the 10,000 view because I don't I don't
2775640	2779640	honestly I don't use YouTube a lot I've really been trying to focus my efforts on Twitch but
2779680	2784800	when I was at Dragon Con and on the podcast track I took some of the advice I believe it or not even
2784800	2788680	though I didn't take all the advice like start a patreon to heart I took some of the advice like
2788680	2792920	get your stuff out there on as many porn for platforms as possible I took that stuff to heart
2792920	2796760	so I was like you know what I do need to be pushing more of my twitch stuff to YouTube so I
2796760	2800320	was trying to do that and it was just funny that like this first video gets flagged and I have to
2800320	2805560	fight it and all that stuff but the experience could have been worse I guess I'll leave it that
2805560	2810400	way but if the studio had a page that said don't do it then I would have said okay my bad and I
2810400	2815080	would have taken it down and just been like okay I won't do that again so but that was a lot of
2815080	2820800	indie game studios don't give a shit yeah uh SSG100Matt in chat says yeah these BS video
2820800	2825000	flaggers I have a friend who does YouTube full-time and he has to deal with this nonsense he often
2825000	2830120	often has to request a manual review on these claims has anybody ever tried to like class
2830120	2835080	action lawsuit these third-party companies surely that happened at some point with the bigger
2835120	2840880	streamers I'm not gonna do that shit but people like sort of mark plier might be able to so it's
2840880	2846120	not not really but like you know there is that whole case against Alex Mauer right now which is
2846120	2853040	kind of wrapping up oh yeah thing so basically she had a certain chance to respond and she
2853040	2857840	responded late and so now they are filing a motion the strike and all this stuff so it's
2857840	2862640	almost over so when it does end up if if they do win it end up winning which they probably will
2862640	2868400	then that does open it up to the fact that she was filing false DMCAs and they could file a
2868400	2873800	class-action lawsuit against her for lost revenue because she did two hundreds that could be an
2873800	2879560	interesting precedent too so be it'll be interesting to see what happens yeah because I mean it seems
2879560	2885880	like anybody can file a claim and you don't have to be the copyright owner of it and you know it's
2885880	2891920	gonna just fuck everybody over and what you you mean you could even just say low oh yeah and then
2892040	2899240	you know you can some people do this they'll wait the 30 days that they have to appeal and so before
2899240	2902840	they used to not get any revenue for that I think now it goes into an escrow account or something
2902840	2907520	like that and then at the very last second they'll just say okay we're dropping our claim but that
2907520	2911720	was 30 days you weren't getting revenue and by that time you know who's gonna see your video
2911720	2917720	right so all right anyway um what else in my game away let me quickly say Final Fantasy 14 got a
2917720	2921920	patch on Tuesday so I hadn't played in like a month but that was enough to get me to check it
2921920	2926120	out again so I've been playing that a little bit and I'm gonna do a live stream tonight after the
2926120	2931320	show Stardew Valley on Nintendo switch I'm gonna play that for the first time I played it on PC
2931320	2936160	before but I honestly don't remember it at all it was like over a year ago and I played once and I
2936160	2939920	don't remember it at all so I'm gonna but my Twitter has been lighting up with people who
2939920	2944840	love Stardew Valley on the switch and I was like it's only 10 bucks because I already had leftover
2944840	2950520	credit on my accounts I was like you know what let's do it I'm gonna buy Stardew Valley on switch
2950520	2954320	so we're gonna play that after the show tonight so I think that's it for my game a week I've
2954320	2959840	talked enough so Jamie we'll circle back to you sorry we missed you the first go-around but how
2959840	2964280	was your game a week I'm playing Ragnarok online again officially on a free server did that whole
2964280	2972680	little pouring clicky-click game make you want to go back yeah um it's like a quick leveling server
2972760	2979520	so I'm already like rebirth level you know high thief or something oh sorry I'm eating a bagel
2979520	2989360	um it got stuck in my teeth um I'm also of source still playing idle pouring and Pokemon go and that
2989360	2998520	other oh yeah me Tomo um I put danganronpa v3 on hold because like I said I still want to stream it
2998520	3005000	but it's gonna have to wait until I've got the con guy done which you know my deadline I thought
3005000	3011960	was this weekend thankfully it's not but it's busy there you go that and other personal things
3011960	3015760	going on I've still been busy too because I mentioned this last week I've still been busy
3015760	3020600	with that Big Brother thing I talked about I wasn't first voted out so that's a victory for
3020800	3028960	me because I thought I would be but it's still going so it's it's taking maybe 90% of the time
3028960	3033760	it was so I have a little more time to do stuff but not a lot because just like my Skype is
3033760	3041040	constantly going crazy from that game but it's it's fun and I'm meeting new people so yeah anyway
3041040	3045400	that's it that's it for your gaming week that's it for all our gaming weeks I already talked about
3045480	3050800	housekeeping and by the way Jamie no show veterans day weekend I dropped that on us for the first
3050800	3056520	time Alan and I are going to Seattle have fun yeah thank you we will we I earned it dammit this
3056520	3062680	has been a shit year I I am ready to fucking go to Seattle and have fun all right let's get to some
3062680	3069280	gaming news Loki start us off would you yes so Nintendo is looking to get more adult games on
3069280	3076240	the switch so that's kind of a change because you know before they used to kind of not put those
3076240	3080080	types of games on there because the system is more of a family-friendly system but they seem
3080080	3086600	to be kind of moving in the adult theme area as well so for example you know they're saying that
3086600	3093080	games like doom you know Knights of Azure to brighter the new moon shinobi rifle centering
3093080	3098320	kangaroo coming to switch of course is a little bit of a change because those are definitely more
3098360	3107320	an adult-oriented game they're saying that you know I guess the creator of Galvin 2 actually was
3107320	3111840	surprised by Nintendo's reaction to their pitch of releasing that game on their platform he said I
3111840	3116360	thought it wouldn't be possible to release such a game for the switch but surprisingly Nintendo gave
3116360	3122800	me positive feedback so it seems like they're a little bit more open to those types of games on
3122800	3128840	there which is good because I mean honestly you have to catering to children's fine because
3128840	3134080	there's plenty games to do that but you got to cater to as many people as possible so why not
3134080	3138720	I mean I think already they're kind of taking steps in the right direction especially with this
3138720	3142720	you know cross play and stuff all they need to do now is just get rid of those fucking friend codes
3142720	3149800	and then you'll be on board I mean but it seems to move it in the right direction so more blood
3149800	3156240	and more guts on the switch titties more titties on the switchy how about how about how about some
3156240	3164120	dongs to make it fair all right sure thank you Loki I appreciate the blessing with that HD rumble
3164120	3172160	you know you feel the dong in your hand there's a dick in my hand I don't think they vibrate unless
3172160	3179320	you have like additives no accessory oh oh I see I see well you know there's a lot of it it's not
3179360	3184240	supposed to vibrate it's like you know how they have the whole like you know ice cubes in the
3184240	3189280	controller demo type of thing so you won't really vibrate it but like you would you shake the
3189280	3193200	controller back and forth and you'd feel the weights of it flopping about you know flopping
3193200	3202760	all right anyway well what we'll see maybe more adult games coming switch what about night trap
3202760	3206840	because they've been re-released not everywhere night trap gonna come out on hot garbage so I
3207000	3211280	don't know if we need that game I just feel like whatever it's adult games always comes back to
3211280	3218280	night trap like the the og adult game what was that what was that game that was at e3 a decade
3218280	3225680	ago feel three or feel three that's it feel three for the we offer the switch why not put like five
3225680	3229200	nights at Freddy's I'm surprised that isn't on there already I'm kind of surprised too maybe
3229200	3233840	it's maybe it's not as easy as you'd think too because he made it in some type of game maker
3233840	3239520	program so maybe it's not as easy to port it over to the switch hmm but maybe it's inevitable at
3239520	3242800	some point I also got a feel five nights at Freddy's might be a little bit past its prime
3242800	3249800	probably but then again I mean fucking just in the past couple weeks we've had axiom verge and
3249800	3256160	stardew valley and these games that have come out on plenty of other consoles even years ago and I
3256160	3260440	feel like there's a lot of Nintendo fans that are kind of living these things for the first time
3260440	3265320	well I mean you like I think with the Wii U was and they didn't really focus too much on Indies
3265320	3271200	but like any scene that be able to have more visibility because there wasn't so much on the
3271200	3275440	platform and I think that's kind of the same scenario with switches there's not a ton of
3275440	3280400	things on the platform right now so you can get that visibility for your game and actually if
3280400	3286360	there's you know those games coming out few and far between you definitely have more people looking
3286360	3291800	at your game no that's a very good point I think Nintendo's really leveraged their e-shop a lot
3291800	3297200	better this time and you can't say there aren't a lot of games on the switch right now I mean
3297200	3303280	granted they're not a lot of triple-a titles but there's a lot of you know you can download
3303280	3309000	digitally except not all the same time because your switch only has 32 gigs of storage that was
3309000	3315640	really technically you can expand it technically didn't have to technically all right I shouldn't
3315640	3320520	have to do that all right let's talk about Microsoft a little bit Microsoft you know the
3320520	3325000	Kinect has kind of had one foot out the door for a little while now and you may not have realized
3325000	3331440	but when the Xbox one s launched last year which is the smaller Xbox one which is the only Xbox
3331440	3336200	one regular there's gonna be now there used to be a little adapter that you could get with it for
3336200	3341480	free that would allow the Kinect to be used on this console it's basically a USB to connect
3341480	3347600	adapter okay but that promotion you may not realize that ended in March this year so you
3347600	3353000	can no longer get that adapter for free all those connect games are not gonna be able to play well
3353000	3359320	just to be clear and the reason why I bring this up Xbox one X will not have a similar offer and
3359320	3364320	that was confirmed by Aaron Greenberg executive for Xbox on a Twitter I can't believe we're
3364320	3369520	confirming news via Twitter but here we are in 2017 Aaron Greenberg on Twitter said we provided
3369520	3374040	free adapters for a good part of last year following the Xbox one s launch but that program
3374040	3381920	has ended so well I don't think they're selling the Kinect anymore well to be fair is it completely
3381920	3385520	discontinued it's probably harder to find you probably don't get a lot of shelter things that
3385520	3389840	there but I bet you could probably go on Amazon and get one still right but a lot of it's gonna
3389840	3395120	be used yeah I don't think they're selling anymore cuz I can't honestly name you I would
3395120	3402040	assume just dance supports it but I think that is still assumption that's still an assumption
3402040	3406080	maybe just like that they support the move controller but I don't think you need the
3406080	3411840	move controller for anything right all phones but yeah I don't think there's not any games I can
3411840	3416520	think of they're coming out it's like man that's a Kinect game like even those well okay now I take
3416520	3422160	that back there is a couple games do support it but those are those re-released Kinect adventure
3422160	3426600	games remember that they had like the Disney Adventure one that are coming out with controller
3426600	3433000	support now but they still support Kinect because it's you know like an HD remaster okay that's like
3433000	3439240	a very who gives a shit no one's looking for that I do want to point out Rama and chat says Microsoft
3439240	3445400	is still selling the Kinect Brad actually provides the link to Amazon so there you go those yeah they
3445400	3450520	I'm sure they got inventory that they want to move not an inventory you see in stores though so even
3450520	3455840	though we're not gonna bury the Kinect yet the Kinect is certainly it's you know with the Xbox
3455840	3463360	1x they're not focusing on Kinect the message is 4k fucking beautiful gaming that's the message on
3463360	3470080	Xbox one X that is not Kinect anymore so you know they're gonna keep pushing the beautifulness of
3470080	3476400	games like four is a seven and crackdown three when it comes out next year and the other stuff
3476400	3481320	that has the Xbox one I've already forgotten about crackdown three whoops yeah so I'd be
3481320	3485560	curious to see how that little console does this holiday for Microsoft's gonna be very very
3485560	3491200	interesting I think it do well I would assume either I just kind of worry that this well I
3491200	3496520	don't know like definitely the Xbox one X has its audience I don't think it's gonna move the number
3496520	3503240	of units that the switch does this holiday but does it need to maybe not you know the Xbox one
3503240	3508360	X is a high-end piece of hardware I don't know how to move high-end types of numbers I'm sure
3508360	3513960	it where the targets it'll do better one there's more 4k content out there because I think right
3513960	3518480	now it's still very early it's kind of like where 3d TVs were for a while where they're really
3518480	3523640	pushing that it was almost too early I mean the 4k TVs have been out for a while now it's just like
3523640	3529120	is it necessary like do you really feel like that you need to upgrade or anything I don't feel like
3529120	3535360	that yet I mean it would be a nice to have but it's not something I'm looking to go out and do
3535360	3539760	right away until my TV dies and then yeah I'll get 4k TV then that's kind of where I'm at and
3539760	3545840	remember I'd mentioned this after e3 it's like I'm excited to do 4k gaming on PC but even that
3545840	3550040	I think you know the money that I probably would have spent on a 4k graphics card I just bought a
3550040	3557040	vacation with so yeah that's probably gonna wait till 2018 or just take for guys okay oh don't do
3557040	3562400	4k do like 1440p or something like that and just drop it down a little bit and then you have like
3562400	3566680	killer frame rate to go with it oh yeah enhanced everything that's kind of yeah like even or I can
3566680	3571080	play like 2k still runs pretty decent on the car to yeah so that's probably what I'll end up doing
3571080	3578800	so yeah and I can still do 4k movies and all that stuff just fine that I don't runs great on my my
3578800	3583240	rig so you know I still I saw all that but yeah I'm probably just gonna wait a little bit on the
3583240	3590800	gaming portion of that but um I I will say this the Xbox has now become my living room console
3590800	3596840	because my PlayStation 4 got moved into the office so I could do more streaming with it I still play
3596840	3604200	games on PlayStation 4 but I do my Hulu and CBS for Star Trek and all this I do all that on Xbox
3604200	3608440	now I don't do it on PlayStation so just kind of an interesting shift I've been kind of having to
3608440	3612360	use my Xbox more for that media stuff so I can watch on the TV in the living room and the
3612360	3618360	experience has been fine so you know it's pretty easy to grab new apps and I do like I will give
3618360	3625760	it is much easier if I were to say download episodes of RuPaul's Drag Race which I would
3625760	3630640	never do but let's say I did like it's very easy to put them on a USB Drive and then plug that into
3630640	3635520	my Xbox one and just play them right off that so which doesn't really work as easy on PlayStation
3635520	3640600	4 it's too bad I mean I get why they do it but it's too bad that they don't like partner like
3640680	3648680	and this is not even necessarily any you know specific console but one thing I love on my
3648680	3655920	Android TV box is the whole Google cast stuff because they have apps that they build specifically
3655920	3661480	for that and I love the native apps but half of the native apps aren't available you just have to
3661480	3669680	cast over to it but it works fantastic so I'm a little too well actually because my kids tablets
3669800	3676000	it somehow knows that my TV things on our network and if they hit the button it casts to the TV and
3676000	3680840	there's no way to block that so it's like you'll be watching TV also and some shitty YouTube
3680840	3689560	children's things on there my god fucking damn it yeah turn that shit off anyway going to something
3689560	3698240	else about Xbox and Microsoft to remember the original og Xbox the Xbox first Xbox VCR Xbox
3698240	3702880	Uno those games are still gonna be backwards compatible at some point remember crimson skies
3702880	3708720	hello anyway it is still coming Xbox head Phil Spencer reaffirmed in an interview with game
3708720	3714040	spot it is happening saying we're close we're really close we're so close keep going anyway
3714040	3721320	it should gene we should watch by the end of the year so by the end of the year you should be able
3721320	3727600	to play things like crimson skies and fusion frenzy on your Xbox they're just using frenzy
3728240	3735480	just blow a big bunch of games all over you all at once you know what props to them for actually
3735480	3740440	working on backwards compatibility yeah it's like had I known this now when I was shopping for
3740440	3746920	consoles I probably have an Xbox one instead of a PlayStation 4 hmm and it's just disappointing to
3746920	3752280	see how little movement there is on that front with PlayStation it's just they want me to do
3752280	3756720	their streaming service and no I don't want to do your streaming service Sony's getting a little
3756840	3760400	cocky and it might you know it's gonna be interesting are we gonna go in the next in the
3760400	3765320	next gym are we gonna flip back again it's gonna be well the reason why I'm saying Sony's getting
3765320	3769440	cocky just people understand this whole of cross-platform gaming again I don't think it made
3769440	3773600	our show tonight but there was another game out there I was reading a story about that they came
3773600	3779880	out said well we'll be cross-platform on switch Xbox one and PC because Sony won't let us do it
3780040	3787480	and I just Sony can only sit on top of that throne so long you know it's it's people remember that
3787480	3793400	kind of crap mm-hmm mm-hmm all right let's let's hope they correct make a corrective course soon
3793400	3797040	anyway let's move on we've been talking a lot of the first two stories so let's go over to Dark
3797040	3803840	Sakura with what she has to report oh well I don't know if it's gonna be bad or good it could be
3803840	3813440	good it could be like I said bad but humble bundle has been acquired by IGN as in you know
3813440	3825600	the the gaming news slash strategy stuff you know website but anyway they said though that they
3825600	3832840	chose IGN because they quote understand their vision that they think that they'll be able to
3832840	3839800	help hunt a humble bundle continue with their quest for charity and good works through gaming
3839800	3852240	so I hope I hope it stays good I hope hope hope they don't get screwed over in this so yay to
3852240	3856640	register participation for this week's episode of orange island radio at vog network calm use
3856640	3865720	the passphrase door as long as the charity support stays I think there will still be a lot of fans of
3865720	3870600	humble bundle and I think you know again one thing that's gonna have to stay and I don't know how IGN
3870600	3877320	feels about this but the ability to choose you know if you're gonna give money to charity or
3877320	3882240	give money to developers or give money as a tip to the humble bundle itself to keep it going I
3882240	3886720	know the default is usually like a third a third a third but you know if you want you can slide the
3886720	3892040	bar and you just give all the money to charity and you know some people some people play with that
3892040	3900520	maybe they'll give you know 40% to charity 40% to the developers and 20% to humble bundle you know
3900520	3905000	sometimes people like to play with those numbers so I think as long as that stays there people
3905000	3911440	won't get upset but like if the tip becomes required or something like that then that's
3911520	3916360	where people are gonna start to abandon that chip real quick my only thing with humble bundle is
3916360	3921080	that there's so many of them now so frequently that it's hard to keep tabs when good ones are
3921080	3926440	out I wish it integrated more with steam so I could see which games I already own because there's
3926440	3931800	like several humble bundles where like I just don't buy them because I have like half the games on
3931800	3937200	them I mean it's nice to support charities and stuff but I don't need to buy stuff I already have
3937440	3942680	act-deft in chat says I'm not really okay with IGN buying humble but at the same time I do
3942680	3947680	think IGN can help them become bigger s2100 Matt says as long as IGN lets humble continue to do
3947680	3953280	their thing I am okay but I'm extremely cautious about this stop he says I'm sure it was it's
3953280	3957160	gonna change does anyone to remember the stories from a year or so ago when they were saying they
3957160	3962760	couldn't afford to pay humble staff Bobby Blackwell says humble bundles lost their uniqueness they
3962760	3967840	were better when they were just an event now it's just yet another digital storefront and that's
3967840	3973440	boring you know what I hate to fucking bring this up but I'm gonna I'm gonna fucking bring it up
3973440	3979280	it's exactly what's gonna happen to she's one sauce in the winner it's exactly what's gonna
3979280	3983560	happen everybody's losing their fucking mind they're gonna try they're like wow that's not
3983560	3987600	really good this stuff was nasty anyway and then when it comes out and it's it because now
3987600	3991400	McDonald's fucking because of everything's happened they've come back to new a corner
3991600	3996120	fucking publicity got the factory going overtime right now so that come November December they're
3996120	3999480	gonna have that shit everywhere and then people are gonna try it they're gonna be like no wonder
3999480	4007480	they got rid of this shit the first time it's like Crystal Pepsi kinda why can't they bring
4007480	4012280	back Josta if they're gonna bring back something surge bring back surge I know they sell it on
4012280	4017160	Amazon but why can't it be in store I bet you surge sucks too you know what is seriously
4017400	4022600	delicious search was fucking awesome but they changed the recipe so it's not quite the same
4022600	4029200	anymore but I still want I I have found I gotta work something from Amazon recent pretty soon so
4029200	4033040	I'm gonna get surge with that I have found something that tastes like Josta by the way
4033040	4037640	and they sell it at the Russian grocery store out in Citrus Heights it's like some guarana drink but
4037640	4044520	it tastes just like Josta just saying noted that's just like I know I saw catch-up still was my stuff
4044520	4048680	okay I saw ketchup chips for sale the other day ketchup is disgusting I had a very Canadian
4048680	4058880	moment no why not I did order mushroom ketchup really you put it's an 18th century thing you
4058880	4067080	put ketchup on your french fries mayonnaise french fries are a potato fuck that french fries you put
4067080	4070320	ketchup on french fries or not your cheese why can't you put ketchup on potato chips it's they're
4070320	4075680	both potatoes ketchup is disgusting ketchup is fine I almost feel about ketchup the way you do
4075680	4081360	about mayonnaise potato chips in that case fine don't eat them but see you don't really put ketchup
4081360	4086680	on potato chips I'm fine if you want to dip that shit you know that's fine or even the ranch or
4086680	4091840	something that'd be fine but like I don't know if you should put on the chips or make your chips
4091840	4097640	clearly with people's fucking obsession with ranch I don't know I think ranch is nasty in
4097640	4103240	most scenario it's all about balsamic vinegar I knew a guy in college that bought ranch by the
4103240	4110160	gallon and he would have the gallon fucking mug in the the refrigerator and would put it on
4110160	4121920	everything when you dip it in the ranch like the internet like a soda Alan is here to lend us some
4121920	4127320	witful insight now that he heard this the worst application of ranch dressing I've ever seen in
4127320	4132720	my life was back in 95 96 senior year of high school when the cafeteria had the big Costco
4132720	4138480	pumps of ketchup mustard and ranch and people would drizzle ranch on like they're like this
4138480	4144680	shitty cardboard flat pizza that was like it was like it basically wasn't even cheese it was like
4144680	4148960	it was like it was like the frosting top of a zinger doing Twinkie or just peeled it off so
4148960	4156520	that so they would put ranch on that but the worst were the girls who got a Nissan cup of ramen put
4156520	4163920	in the hot water and then put in four pumps of ranch so water down ranch in their cup of noodles
4163920	4173120	that happened that's a travesty that happened 20 years ago 22 years ago and a tragedy so worse
4173120	4177880	I've never looked at ranch the same way again I do like Hidden Valley Ranch you know if we're
4177880	4183520	gonna get brand specific because oh no no more ranch discussion sorry Ken's brand is the best
4184080	4190400	cool ranch and it's on a Dorito I want nothing Doritos are fucking gross all right and you can
4190400	4196400	use them as fire kindling it's your story all right no Alan was just borrowing my mic for a
4196400	4200480	minute artitsu we only have three in studio right now seriously yes Szechuan sauce is gonna be a
4200480	4205360	fucking joke and I don't know why people were flipping did you hear someone traded one of those
4205360	4210480	packets for a car I apologize for the listener to the listeners for bringing up Szechuan sauce
4210480	4215200	on olr I was trying to make a point and look what fucking happened I will learn my lesson
4215200	4222240	for next time and do better oh we go on tangents like that's this is the first time that's ever
4222240	4231160	happened our 10 into the show Loki next story so you know as I mentioned I may be getting back
4231160	4239080	into Pokemon soon that's because the new update has been data mined and we've found pictures for
4239080	4245160	the Halloween event that's right there's gonna be some Halloween event which is not unexpected but
4245160	4253400	along with that there's also trophy listings and badges for the third gen of Pokemon so third gen
4253400	4259120	of Pokemon I'm probably gonna be here within two weeks or so it could be a limited start
4259120	4265200	remember when Gen 2 released it was just the babies for the first yeah I don't think it's
4265720	4272000	but I'm just saying don't be shocked if it's the ghost Pokemon only I do need some more
4272000	4276280	ghost Pokemon though I'm pretty deficient in the ghost Pokemon area I don't think there's any like
4276280	4281560	big heavy-hitting ghost Pokemon right now like maybe Gengar but you have to really power it up
4281560	4289360	you know yeah so but yeah they're saying though there's a new loading screen and it has I guess
4289360	4294400	teasing third generation Pokemon as well so they've got that's the most damning and yet
4294440	4303920	dustclops, shuppet, bannet, dust skull and sableye so and then of course Gengar is on there but those
4303920	4309200	might be the only Pokemon I'm just warning because I seem to remember when Gen 2 launched we got a
4309200	4315800	loading screen with Pichu and Igglybuff and the babies that they let out originally so I'm just
4315800	4321480	saying be prepared y'all that those may be the only Gen 3 Pokemon we get at first and then by
4321520	4325920	December or whatever or no probably earlier than that by November Thanksgiving or something we'll
4325920	4330560	have all the rest of Gen 3 but I'm glad we didn't have to wait an entire year it was only about eight
4330560	4335040	months well can we fast forward to Alola already well that's what I'm saying it's like I think that
4335040	4340880	the lull is going it's it's not dragging out as long anymore it's like people are kind of getting
4340880	4345840	over it really fast and so they're gonna have to get those updates a lot faster yeah well I would
4345840	4350440	say Niantic is still it's raining money over there because I'm sure with the raids you know there's
4350440	4355120	still enough people doing them that they're making money you know right it's not kid ourselves but
4355120	4361520	isn't it nice to make a lot of money and we still have Mewtwo raids to really I mean I know they've
4361520	4366600	done a couple but they didn't really launch them big so I mean I still don't have Mewtwo which
4366600	4370760	actually I'm kind of pressed about that because a lot of people I know do have them so I kind of
4370760	4375560	like that to come back so I can try to catch another so we'll see though maybe that's something
4375560	4382160	it's gonna launch around gen 3 I don't know so as 100 Matt thinks in our chat I think there will
4382160	4386880	be more costumed Pokemon they did come out with this update about not being able to transfer
4386880	4392880	costume Pokemon without an extra screen I thought that was always because we had that bug a month or
4392880	4399320	two ago where the Pikachu's weren't showing their hats right yeah and so people like may accidentally
4399320	4403800	throw them away but now you can't do that so that's great I'm so happy they put that in actually
4403800	4408160	and then one other thing that they're doing also a little bit before this whole update that's
4408160	4413320	allegedly this was happen this is Pokemon go photography contest so using the app you can
4413320	4418720	actually take pictures of course of Pokemon and with the AR camera so they're basically having
4418720	4426080	you kind of try to get the best spot or shot that you can and then share it on Instagram and tag it
4426080	4431760	Pokemon go contest so you have until the 25th of October to do that and I guess they haven't really
4431800	4437160	announced with the prize oh here we go so if you do win and this is used US residents only
4437160	4442360	unfortunately the winner gets a bag containing a poster autographed by the team a pair of wireless
4442360	4451800	Bluetooth earbuds and go plus so it's kind of alright can I submit old photos because I have
4451800	4458280	a picture of a Paris on the grill at Benihana that I still think is funny probably I mean that
4458280	4463840	would be fun and fine I might try that definitely don't do anything you would see in the Pokemon go
4463840	4473200	our Pokemon go gone wild community oh god that is unfortunately a thing oh god is it a tumbler

4604640	4611520	have them either come on girl I have morals I'm just not interested in that kind of garbage come
4611520	4617520	on no Gus and chat says Rob's gonna be up all night yeah crying all right hey you must be this
4617520	4627240	tall to enter all right I do I just doesn't you know morals have nothing to do with the dirty
4627240	4633320	mind all right moving on let's talk about him fortnight because I have if you're gonna be up
4633320	4638560	to fort all night over on a gadget they had a story that caught my eye is talking about a
4638560	4642480	fortnight lawsuit because I know a lot of people are playing the fortnight battle royale online
4642600	4647560	well apparently epic games has filed a civil lawsuit against two people they say are cheating
4647560	4653520	while playing online and they're doing it through a website called addicted cheats which apparently
4653520	4659280	this website it's subscription based and you can on this website use their services to hunt down
4659280	4667480	and kill twitch streamers while they played live what a bunch of dicks what a dick bag thing to do
4667480	4671320	yeah people like doing it but that's usually they know it's usually they have a delay on it
4671320	4675720	and a lot of twitch streamers can put like a 30-second delay so it doesn't matter interesting
4675720	4684200	but so anyway I what epic games excuse you have a cease pardon me blessing I'm allergic to bullshit
4684200	4690800	are rated stuff with epic game says in the suit that individuals had to dive in and modify
4690800	4696900	fortnight's source code and able to do this and this violates the EU LA and the DMCA that of
4696900	4702500	course being the License Agreement and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act so anyway epic is not
4702500	4707820	suing the site to get it off the internet it's suing the two individuals for copyright infringement
4707820	4714020	that can carry a penalty up to a hundred and fifty thousand dollars these two defendants are
4714020	4719900	technical support for addicted cheats calm so it looks like epic games may be trying to make an
4719900	4726140	example out of them in the complaint one defendant was banned from fortnight nine times continue to
4726140	4731700	make new accounts to continue playing accused of using specifically the addicted cheat site to hunt
4731700	4737620	down popular players while live streaming which I guess is a whole prat is a whole part of the dark
4737620	4744580	web no dark web thing they just do that the dark web yeah called a stream sniping and that is
4744580	4748580	forbidden in the code of contact for player unknowns battlegrounds which is why the guy
4748580	4755700	got banned nine times so anyway that would be interesting also addicted cheats has taken that
4755740	4765060	cheat offline saying it's closed for a legal issue there you go come on no Gus and chat says addicted
4765060	4773060	cheats is that like an Ashley Madison site something let's see stop Ian chat says how do
4773060	4777140	you even find individual streamers apparently this site would let you do it this site somehow
4777140	4782060	goes to the code and and will put like in their game people would normally do is they'd have a
4782220	4786700	stream on at the same time and they try to get in the same game as a streamer and they kind of
4786700	4791820	figure out based on where they see them right you know but then you have that's that's really easy
4791820	4797540	to do if you have like a short delay it's the whole look it's the whole rule of golden I you
4797540	4801460	don't fucking look at my screen to figure out where I am you keep your eyes on a damn screen
4801460	4806580	we're just like why waste your time doing that I mean I guess if you think if you're just trolling
4806580	4811860	I guess you might be easily amused by that kind of stuff but that just seems dumb yeah in case you
4811860	4814980	don't kind of brings up in chat saying can't someone just do that looking at someone's stream
4814980	4819220	yes but you can't really force your way into their game and I'm assuming this website kind
4819220	4824100	of facilitates you being able to make sure you get matched with them no I don't know I don't know
4824100	4828460	what that would do I don't know what it does because I would not use such a site this would
4828460	4833860	like show like say the usernames from like a longer distance away so they can see oh this is
4833860	4837780	where this person is and they it's like a wall hack almost where you can see the person through
4837780	4842620	the walls and so you can see where they are just goes make a beeline you know a lot about this
4842620	4850180	Loki well I've been playing games for a long time I have to all right moving on speaking of she who
4850180	4855180	has been playing games for a long time dark soccer we have for us I have some stuff about blizzard
4855180	4864420	sue in the pants off people because it's not you know the the 2000 teens without having you know
4864460	4873300	one company sue another and in this case blizzard is suing a and actually its partner oversees
4873300	4879580	neaties I think it's called net ease are suing developers of a game called heroes of warfare
4879580	4888660	the developers for three nine nine and they are they put out what they called the first MOBA on
4889540	4898900	iOS or Android they have you know stylized characters with checkpoints on maps that's
4898900	4905820	similar layouts like in overwatch and certain sound effects that sound like they've been pulled
4905820	4915300	directly from overwatch as well as a very similar UI so yeah Blizzard's like I know you didn't and
4915300	4923780	decided to lay the smack down financially on this Chinese company which I mean we get a lot
4923780	4932740	of clones I think you know trying to make money off of successful IPs but in this case I was
4932740	4937540	looking at some of the video of it it looks pretty pretty similar I mean the biggest difference is
4937540	4944700	platform but I don't know it's cute I mean you still make me it's probably still make me sick
4944700	4949780	you still can't put Super Mario Brothers on the iPhone unless you're Nintendo just because it's
4949780	4955780	a change in platform right yeah that whole type of thing yeah so so so they're getting their their
4955780	4961540	butt sued that's what you get come up with an original idea it'll be interesting to see how
4961540	4967140	it turns out because this practice is very common not just in China if you go on to you know
4967300	4974300	Apple Store or Google Play you're gonna find tons of clones of games Russian hackers gonna hack look
4974300	4979660	look at look when flappy bird came out some dude made a game called flappy vog it was such a ripoff
4979660	4986940	I'm just I'm teasing obviously I think a ton of people did and for one flappy vog speeds up as
4986940	4992740	you play which the original doesn't do so it does have a key difference but anyway all that stuff
4992740	4996660	aside I mean there's all these types of you know ripoffs but there's a big difference probably
4996740	5002620	between something like flappy bird and you know cuz again I'll you know kidding aside these other
5002620	5006820	knockoffs usually don't have a bird it's flappy something else you know a flappy podcast hosts
5006820	5013340	or whatever but you'd usually don't like copy art assets down to you know what's really
5013340	5018500	indistinguishable from other games I don't know those pipes sure did look like super mario bros
5018500	5024940	pipes that's true that's true oh how funny I never knew this Bobby Blackwell and chat says fun fact
5025060	5031580	I have never actually played flappy bird when I made flappy vog I just saw a video or two well I
5031580	5036780	take comfort in knowing I have probably one of the last phones left they can still play flappy bird
5036780	5043820	because I still not on iOS 11 you know what what never played flappy bird flappy bird happy bird
5043820	5052900	yeah never played flappy bird there's probably a reddit for that to do another story Loki so
5053500	5057660	we talked a little bit about loot boxes earlier and that's kind of one way developers and
5057660	5063460	publishers I think publishers are more involved with this piece out parts of games that would
5063460	5067900	normally be included in the full price of the game well another practice to do that as well is
5067900	5076940	pre-order bonuses that's right and so it's there was a specific online web advertisement from the
5076940	5085060	wonderful folks at the evil G that were advertising the pre-order bonus for Assassin's Creed origins
5085060	5090500	and so it kind of pissed off people a little bit because it basically showed this camel jump up in
5090500	5096060	the way it's like sorry the bonus mission is blocked unless you pre-order Assassin's Creed
5096060	5104020	origins because you know it's sort of playing or making fun of the whole pre-order culture but
5104540	5109740	being that this company is the one that kind of perpetuates that pre-order culture some people
5109740	5115220	weren't so sensitive to or weren't as happy to see that in an advertisement blatantly just saying
5115220	5121460	kind of like yeah we know what's wrong with fuck you guys pre-ordered this shit you know so that's
5121460	5126380	the thing apparently though I've from what I've seen is they've kind of taken this ad offline so
5126380	5132020	you can't really find it anymore but do you think there were some angry gamers around this probably
5132020	5140500	people get angry over a lot of things but it is kind of angry people on my yes yes on your
5140500	5147580	internet it's more real than you think I just but yeah it is kind of shitty the block a mission
5147580	5152340	behind a pre-ordered you know DLC thing that's why you wait for the game of the year edition
5152340	5158860	you know mm-hmm late gamers all right well hopefully you won't have to wait too long to
5158940	5162620	pick up this game because it's a blizzard game so you know they do good stuff as we were talking
5162620	5167420	about earlier apparently it's a new overwatch game that they may be working on this is huge
5167420	5172540	rumor and it's based off the fact that a vacancy on the blizzard jobs website says that they are
5172540	5178780	looking to expand overwatch with a generalist artist intern with knowledge and understanding
5178780	5183340	of overwatch to work on a unannounced project well shoot that could be anything because that
5183340	5188340	could be like a mobile type of game or something you know certainly will make a lot of sense if
5188340	5195260	blizzard wanted to use the overwatch IP on mobile somehow over watches the overwatch hmm let's see
5195260	5202300	it's also brought up that a while ago last year over on neo gaff somebody had found a listing for
5202300	5208220	a lead software engineer for a first-person title and Mike Morehame has confirmed in the past there
5208220	5215620	are teams working on new projects especially on mobile so it really could be anything I wouldn't
5215620	5222540	mind seeing a new overwatch game in a couple years but I really like the stuff like Junkenstein's
5222540	5229420	revenge and the PvE type of stuff especially when they did the uprising I think was an overwatch
5229420	5234420	uprising I like those types of events and the Junkenstein event by the way you know I know
5234420	5238420	we're joking about loot boxes but if you are an overwatch player don't forget to sign in and get
5238420	5241940	your Halloween loot box and do the Junkenstein uprising because it's not that hard and you get
5241940	5245860	a loot box from that too and in fact if you do it like nine times you can get like three more
5245860	5252860	loot boxes you can get a lot so yeah get your loot boxes then you don't have to buy them for
5252860	5259460	your cosmetic crap sure but yeah a new overwatch game I'd be into it but I see where blizzard
5259460	5263980	maybe wouldn't want to cannibalize the overwatch they have now so it would have to be something
5263980	5268180	maybe a little different but I think an overwatch PvE type of game would be awesome so we'll see
5268180	5278620	all right well let's travel back to a simpler time we're gonna travel back to a time when there
5278620	5283740	was no loot boxes there was just in fact if something was wrong with this cartridge like
5283740	5289060	if the boss was just missing on level 30 too fucking bad you dealt with it you didn't have
5289060	5296260	loot box you had a recall you had a hacked passwords yeah seriously so we're gonna terror
5296260	5303420	horror danger exclamation point and Justin Bailey our classic game of the week the dark
5303420	5309220	soccer is gonna step into the gaming vault find a game that she thinks hey you little brats give
5309220	5313020	me all the money you are gonna give the loot box people and go play this classic game instead
5313020	5318580	because it has no loot boxes and you can still play this game for like 60 hours oh yeah this
5318580	5324700	game is at least 60 hours of joy this is a great pick too it's one again here again how long have
5324700	5330100	we been doing this segment like almost 500 classic and this is a game that I started and never spent
5330100	5335500	much more time on I really really wish that I had and this is one of those games where I'm like how
5335500	5341620	is how have we not done this before right now so anyway this is the classic game is Terranigma
5341620	5351740	which in Japan was called a tenchi sozo which means the creation of heaven and earth it was
5351740	5361900	released in 1995 by enix with character designs done by a mangaka named Fujiwara Kamui Kamui sorry
5361900	5371660	it was released in English in the UK it was also released in German French and Spanish but never
5371660	5377380	released in North America which is a fucking travesty because this game I mean even a little
5377380	5381860	bit I played of it was really good you know it was just you know a little bit more of my own
5381860	5390060	gamer a DD and no SSJ 100 mat Julian is never picking halo because I'm only the my words the
5390060	5397660	final word the buck stops with me yeah then I kick it in the ass so basically the game has a
5397660	5403660	top-down perspective over the world it is an action-based real-time battle system to where
5403660	5408500	you do different techniques depending on with your if you're running jumping attacking or using
5408500	5417020	a combination of the actions but each attack will have different ways it can hurt different
5417020	5423940	enemies and so you get experience you know it increases your stats you get you know whatever
5423940	5431260	dead enemies leave behind like oh look the squirrel left me a compound bow that's interesting
5431260	5437780	where did the scroll keep the compound but you know bow up its ass compressed highly compressed
5437780	5445700	you also have you know spells and then different things that boost spells and the series that you
5445700	5451380	can click these things called magic rocks that you take them to a magic shop and have them
5451380	5457380	transformed into rings and summons so kind of like early materia system too if you think about it
5458380	5464500	but the thing that I always thought was cool about this game was the world it was built in is that
5464500	5472340	you have a fictional earth that is a hollow sphere so you have the people that live on the surface
5472340	5479900	and the people that live on the internal face of it so light side dark side and then two different
5479980	5489300	forces that rule them on the top it's the ability to evolve and exceed and on the dark side it's
5489300	5495780	decline so that creates two forces called God and devil which I guess people in America have
5495780	5501380	their you know head so far if their asses over anything with vague religious symbolism so
5501380	5509260	whatever the fuck and then like the last battle takes place in Antarctica so but it's it's a
5509260	5517540	really really neat game it has really great music and of course it was done by annex just a really
5517540	5525860	gorgeous game put out for the Super Famicom Super Nintendo and the company that that created it was
5525860	5534340	quintet who I'm sorry the development company was quintet who also designed Actraiser and Soul
5534340	5543660	Blazer you know illusion of Gaia an annex basically commissioned them a subcontractor and
5543660	5550940	wanted an action role-play game so that's how it happened so basically the the founder of quintet
5550940	5558940	wrote the script for the game and the scenarios had to be approved and it was just really a lot
5558940	5568660	that went into it they they had a little bit of I'd say early CG in it you know for designing
5568660	5574700	the graphics for the resurrection scenes and just pretty pretty crazed me crazy but it was never
5574700	5579940	published in North America because annex closed its US subsidiary before the localization was
5579940	5590020	finished so the English versions were used that were made for America were released in Europe and
5590020	5599100	Australian when Nintendo had it ready to go so it also had like a lot of merchandise that came out
5599100	5606700	with it including a guidebook a World Atlas and a novel and also another novelization of the game
5607660	5615940	full other art books in two manga based on it to full sorry a two volume manga that was based on
5615940	5624660	it and these have never been released outside of Japan although Club Nintendo did a 32 page comic
5624660	5634420	that came out in Germany the soundtrack of course has been released in 1995 and it had the first
5634420	5644940	six tracks were arranged versions the game music it sold pretty well Famicom sushi gave it a 30 out
5644940	5651820	of 40 so I mean even so that's not high enough not high enough no it isn't this game's great but
5651820	5658620	basically this is considered to be like one of the best games that never came out in the u.s.
5658620	5665180	it's really unfortunate that this whole series was not represented I mean I don't think these
5665180	5669540	games have a direct relation to each other between terror enigma and brain Lord and illusion a guy
5669540	5673340	and all that but they're still considered a creation trilogy yeah yeah that's a good way
5673340	5680540	of putting it a creation trilogy like like a Kevin Smith trilogy with clerks and more like like the
5680540	5687020	ice cream and blood ones what is the ice cream and bloods cream that they call it for like hot
5687020	5694100	fuzz Oh and Shaun of the Dead oh okay so the movies with that guy well no because they have
5694100	5699180	the same brand of ice cream in every yeah in all three of those movies yeah okay okay I got you I
5699180	5703780	got ya well they had they have big Kahuna burger and all of Tarantino's movies but it well in
5703780	5707580	Tarantino's already said his movies exist in the same universe yeah but anyway sorry I didn't mean
5707580	5712060	to cut you off but it's it's really tragic that these games don't exist on like or they're not
5712060	5716660	represented on the SNES classic at all you know like at least I would have killed to have I'd
5716660	5724420	rather distant Star Fox to me too me too well we'll just have to wait for S or now that it's
5724420	5729320	been hacked we'll just wait for SNES classic to electric boogaloo because you know it's only a
5729320	5734420	matter of time well now that it's already been hacked you know the other loading people are
5734420	5739500	loading their own games oh sure on them now that's it's official of course but I'm waiting for that
5739500	5745780	to be rock-solid before I touch mine well I'm not gonna mod mine because I have a never drive
5745780	5752420	although I want the one that will let you do the super FX games I think that'd be great but but
5752420	5757140	yeah this game totally worth it if you haven't played it in fact I'm kind of thinking I might
5757140	5761980	restart it just because it's been on my mind lately I've been trying to find a PAL copy of
5761980	5769180	it for a while haven't had any luck so we'll see all right there it is your classic game of the
5769180	5775460	week tear enigma on the Super Nintendo sadly never in the US but I'm sure lots of you have played it
5775460	5782820	anyway bastards wink before we go to our break Bobby black wolf with a technical question for
5782820	5788740	the goddess of the classic game of the week by black wolf wants to know is Starcraft 2 eligible
5788740	5792980	for classic game of the week because of its copyright date or does the 10-year timer start
5792980	5798540	when the Super Nintendo classic was released my guess would be she did a game that never came out
5798540	5803220	before as classic game of the week once because you know the lore and everything behind that so I
5803220	5808660	would think under those rules it would be eligible but you're not gonna pick a bad game just kidding
5808660	5815020	I'm kidding maybe you can do Stark we can we can we can revisit the thought of Starcraft 2
5815420	5823220	you mean Star Fox 2 Star Fox 2 we can we can revisit it because I think I would go by its
5823220	5828260	original inception like when it was actually finished why does this Starcraft by the way
5828260	5834660	Star Fox 2 it could it could end up there but people could have been playing it for longer
5834660	5842300	than 10 years but you're probably not gonna pick it we'll see never say never s2 and her Matt says
5842300	5847220	Star Fox 2 would happen sooner than a low to probably that is well none of the halo games are
5847220	5851980	gonna be in there so you may as well just forget it unless it's like a halo parody or knockoff like
5851980	5859700	the Atari halo yeah Atari halo maybe I'd do Atari halo you go but I wouldn't do like actual halo you
5859700	5867180	did and to be and people forget you did marathon at one point so close enough did I yeah you did
5867180	5874460	I'm almost positive you did on the Mac like years ago you know that the bungees first game oh yo
5874460	5881820	that sorry yeah I was like when did I marathon halo no no the game the game yeah I did marathon
5881820	5887940	because it was notable for spawning the garbage that is halo all right sorry it's not garbage
5887940	5896780	garbage actually serves a purpose Bobby Black Wolf says you have two more years halo 2600 was
5896780	5901840	released in 2009 we'll hold out hope that this show you know will be around that long no it
5901840	5905780	should there's no reason why it shouldn't but you know no all right we are gonna take a break though
5905780	5909940	I know we're we've been around a long time tonight and we're gonna take a break but when we come back

5977380	5982700	tonight where I feel like we're not competing against anything on TV for a change it's all
5982700	5987500	the big TV shit is Sunday nights but I think we have a reprieve this week right Game of Thrones
5987500	5993860	is done is walking dead back I have that is that a thing I have no idea either so I don't think we
5993860	5999340	have anything we're competing against right now at least not until what two weeks from now when
5999340	6003140	I'm sure everybody's gonna be binging Stranger Things but that comes out on Friday so that's
6003140	6007580	so people should be done it's only like eight episodes right change it okay eight episodes
6007580	6011420	isn't a lot so you can you can binge that well no actually no it's more Nate episodes it was
6011420	6015140	quite a few last time it's like 12 or 13 no stranger things is only like six episodes the
6015140	6019500	first time it's more this time I think yeah so I don't know maybe maybe somebody in our chat knows
6019500	6027940	over at live dot vog network comm where Rama says walking dead is next week oh there you go and
6027940	6033620	let's see come on no Gus says Major League Baseball is happening right now well we always have to do
6033620	6038420	compete against sports that's that's always if it's not baseball it's football or it's basketball
6038780	6042580	there's always something on hockey it you know something's always gonna be on on Sunday night
6042580	6049340	okay Kaijuto says it was eight the first the first season was eight okay maybe it is ten this time
6049340	6056300	then you're right it is more this time okay let's move on though less TV more games rapid-fire news
6056300	6061500	starting with Loki this is kind of a weird place to play games but apparently there is a Russian
6061500	6068140	made van and truck company it called I guess gazelle and their gazelle next vans and trucks
6068140	6075300	have a Easter egg hidden in them in fact apparently in this vans dash you can play Tetris but how you
6075300	6081860	unlock it it's quite complicated so they have actually some basic instructions so first you
6081860	6088200	would turn the ignition on start the car activate the right turn signal for three blinks then you
6088200	6096120	would do two clicks of the trip odometer reset twice and says and then push the clutch five
6096120	6105400	times and then rev the engine to 2,000 rpm while turning on the left turn indicator this sounds a
6105400	6111400	lot like that Rainbow Road Tesla thing that Bobby did a video for at the fog network YouTube plug
6111400	6118080	plug but I mean seriously there was that YouTube that he did which showed that except that wasn't
6118200	6123040	really a game he actually showed that to me when I was in Atlanta and he was taking me there yeah
6123040	6128040	you can actually play it well you can turn the dial or whatever to move the pieces back and forth
6128040	6133160	and I think you click on the other dial to drop them so it's it's neat that you can do that why
6133160	6138960	you don't do that I don't know you must be incredibly bored you must really want to play
6138960	6143480	Tetris Tetris on it's like just like there's people that really want to play NES golf on the
6143480	6152720	switch these hacks and things happening yeah so apparently I mean it's a thing but it's just okay
6152720	6160640	that's kind of a head scratcher kind of like Sony making a movie based on the settlers of Catan I
6160640	6167640	can't imagine how that would be there really is no story in the settlers of Catan except for trading
6167640	6173800	and screwing people over by you know building the longest road and you know what they made a
6173800	6179920	movie off of clue it was one of the best things ever so why not then of course they made a movie
6179920	6185520	out of battleship and it was terrible they also made a movie out of you know I feel like I've
6185520	6189640	asked this before media and that was pretty terribly nice him in the movie right it was
6189640	6198320	did he get a chance to say you suck my battleship I don't cuz like oh if nobody in that movie
6198320	6203880	screams you sunk my battleship then that movie ain't worth shit now to be fair apparently this
6203880	6212200	is being okay so this is being driven though they've got basically a few people on board
6212200	6221240	so Dan Lin Gale Katz and Jonathan Eric will produce the film and I guess blaze Hemingway
6221240	6226160	will write the screenplay now some of those names may not sound familiar cats I guess they said he's
6226160	6233200	done 20 or films over the last 20 years including the line of fire in Air Force One I guess Lin has
6233200	6241000	had several movies as well including the new it that you've produced a Sherlock Holmes the Lego
6241000	6250800	movie the invention of lying also Terminator salvation gangsters go on death note so I don't
6250800	6256040	know I didn't mean it's even here miss with some of these Sony movies but I honestly don't know
6256040	6261600	where they would go with this because the it's if there's no plot to the game there's no backstory
6261600	6266640	it's just kind of this game so I don't know what the hell they would do with this other than okay
6266640	6275960	it's a medieval movie about settling its people people settling in the role of Catan at least the
6275960	6281160	Oregon Trail had a story behind it yeah like that would be alright but you could just do a movie
6281160	6286840	based on the actual Oregon Trail you have to remember that game was based on actual events
6286840	6293400	it's a little different settlers of Catan isn't based on anything so alright anyhow hey maybe a
6293400	6297400	movie worry or excuse me movie a movie that actually has a series that could get a movie
6297400	6303720	someday civilization all right I feel big cities why I don't know if I would be comfortable with
6303720	6311200	seeing Gandhi as this evil overlord I'm down that's true anyway civilization 6 which was a
6311200	6316960	game I was playing not that long ago actually they're getting some tweaks coming up the latest
6316960	6321920	update for the game has been announced by Firaxis and it's going to be kind of really tinkering the
6321960	6326360	religion aspect of the game is going to be getting the biggest overhaul religion is a victory
6326360	6329800	condition in the game right now but apparently it's one of the ones that's a little bit broken
6329800	6335080	it doesn't work quite as well so so new beliefs and religious units will be coming out with the
6335080	6340440	game there's also going to be two new pantheons in that new founder follower enhancer and worship
6340440	6345520	beliefs some new buildings and a new combat unit called the warrior monk which sounds like it might
6345520	6349080	tie into religions it sounds like they're really kind of inflating that part of the game this is
6349080	6354560	not DLC it's actually a patch that's going to be happening which is pretty cool I would have
6354560	6359400	thought maybe this would be the year well I guess they just sieve six was last year's game so maybe
6359400	6364680	next year we're gonna see something kind of what did they call it beyond Earth those is the Alpha
6364680	6368800	Centauri but I think they did beyond Earth on Civ fives engine so to be interesting to see if we
6368800	6376520	get the Civ 6 in space or maybe maybe something else Civ 4 got the colonization reimagining so
6376520	6380400	maybe they'll do something else with Civ 6's engine but that would probably be around next
6380400	6387880	year but this year you get some balancing issues and that'll be good also in news with this the
6387880	6393400	news this week I was going to bring up this story from our pals of Bahmani style calm but their
6393400	6397920	website appears to be down right now I guess too many people are all story oh so hopefully somebody
6397920	6403800	is also seen this but I know the article was about harmonics collecting the best rock band stories
6403800	6410160	out there for a 10-year celebration of rock band all in related news rock band is 10 years old
6410160	6417480	that's a game of the week yeah I know right that makes me feel really old but that is that's where
6417480	6422240	we're at rock band is that old and so they're collecting some good stories and memories there
6422240	6428680	probably to do some sort of retrospective that they're working on there so I'm sure we have a
6428760	6434920	few I know that I always thought that um loud event that you know seg was on the show promoting
6434920	6439360	a couple times was pretty cool and I did I got to do the hosting thing for one year that was a
6439360	6447120	lot of fun so hopefully that would be something that will make it into the memories book so all
6447120	6453240	right dark Sakura what do you have for rapid-fire news oh just some stuff in fact the thing that I
6453240	6462400	actually would rather like to have only for one game the this thing called the super retrocade
6462400	6468080	is going to be launching this year and it has a lot of Capcom and Data East stuff on it the game
6468080	6475800	I am most interested in is being able to play three wonders at home on my TV that would be
6475800	6485080	great but it comes has wired controllers you can do save states SD card support HDMI AV out and 90
6485080	6492720	titles so that'll be cool if the emulation is good yeah 90s good well apparently their last console
6492720	6498040	emulation one so good so they got to work on that and then something else too and I've actually seen
6498040	6505280	some of this being played is a Jersey Jack is releasing a new Pirates of the Caribbean pinball
6505280	6512840	that blows the other one out of the water haha pirate joke are I get it but it has like this
6512840	6519480	like whirlpool and you can shoot cannons back and forth between two ships in this little triple
6519480	6525280	spinner in the middle that really makes for some unpredictable ball control it's it's really nice
6525280	6535480	it is really good and if you don't know Jersey Jack did the tables that they did did was the
6535480	6543520	Hobbit and Wizard of Oz and the third one I can't remember what it was but they did it so this is
6543520	6549440	their fourth table I know very cool all right yeah they're like a they're like a newer pinball
6549440	6554960	company right they have some stuff at the coin op here locally I feel like one or two of those
6554960	6559920	tables has shown up there so I could be wrong I don't know all right let's travel around the
6559920	6564600	world and check out some games that are coming out in a store near you this week what's on shelves
6564600	6572960	this week Loki lots of things so we've got starting off a a tree in Odyssey 5 beyond the

6869620	6874100	to get into though and then we'll open up our skype line at orange lounge radio on skype all
6874100	6878500	one word let's get to those stories first though starting with Loki yes this week they have the
6878500	6883780	oculus connect event so they made several announcements regarding the oculus platform
6883780	6889980	so along with that of course is that the price drop that they did back in the summer for the
6889980	6897420	oculus rift is now gonna be permanent so that'll be $3.99 now for the headset and two sensors and
6897420	6902860	the touch controllers and I guess a bunch of games so you can check that out also they announce that
6902980	6909180	their standalone headset that's gonna be its own platform that doesn't require any sort of phone
6909180	6914660	or anything is gonna be coming out pretty soon that is the oculus go it's gonna be coming up for
6914660	6923900	$199 and apparently you know it is gonna be its own standalone thing it's gonna have a single palm
6923900	6930540	controller kind of similar to what they have with the oc the gear VR so it's gonna be a little bit
6930540	6935740	different in that sense then they also announced there was yet another platform that they were
6935740	6939820	working on but that's not they're sending out dev kits for that right now so that's something
6939820	6945580	that's in the future but it's gonna be kind of think similar long lines of the oculus go but
6945580	6951860	more souped up it probably more expensive along with that they were showing off some new games
6951860	6956980	that are gonna be coming out for the rift one of which is being worked on by respawn entertainment
6956980	6964540	so they've you know got a game coming as well I'm not sure exactly what it's gonna be but they've
6964540	6968940	made some pretty cool games Bobby's in our chat room over at live dot vog network comm saying
6968940	6974060	that oculus go is the gear VR but without the phone requirements that's pretty much the level
6974060	6979580	of awesome you can expect out of that yeah I mean it's something it's something you know if you're
6979580	6983780	if you're an Apple person you know you know you don't really have access to gear VR so this is
6983780	6989460	some way you could do that so I mean Alan has the gear VR cuz he got his when he got his galaxy
6989460	6995780	yeah I I have one but mines for these six so it's pretty old and they've used it the first day and
6995780	7005380	we haven't used it since just saying I've used it a couple times I use the gear the oculus F kid to
7005380	7009620	more than I have the gear VR and honestly I don't like using it with my phone too much because my
7009620	7015900	phone screens kind of it's not as high resolution as it could possibly be and I don't know it's just
7015900	7020460	the stuff that you can get on the phone games it's not all that great they've got minecraft
7020460	7023940	which is kind of cool but I would be more interested in something now that I have a more
7023940	7029980	powerful PC that can actually do VR more interested in playing that in fact actually having bothered to
7029980	7036180	hook up my DK to to my PC but I'm kind of curious to see what that would be like now they can run
7036180	7041580	the frame rates for some of those games mm-hmm but I do want to get an actual oculus headset
7041580	7045620	at some point or vibe five is more expensive though but hopefully with them dropping the price
7045620	7050820	permanently that'll drive them to drop their price yeah there's a little VR refresh happening going
7050820	7056660	on right now cuz PlayStation VR just had their Japan just got right and then also there's still
7056660	7062080	all those other VR devices that are gonna be coming for like Windows for like Windows
7062080	7068560	holographic and stuff like that so you know where are those because those are supposed to be cheaper
7068560	7074920	in price as well so eventually it'll be just like buying a monitor mm-hmm yeah me interesting all
7074920	7079960	right well moving on maybe maybe a game that you can play in VR if they're making it for it I don't
7079960	7085600	know is riot games next game because it is funny that they're called riot games when they only
7085600	7090520	really have one game which of course is League of Legends if you weren't already aware now League
7090520	7097600	of Legends has been a game that's been around since what 11 years been a while at least riot
7097600	7102040	games been around since 2006 I don't think League of Legends came out right away but it's been out a
7102040	7107320	little while but anyway the two founders of riot games did say this week they are handing off the
7107320	7112280	management of League of Legends to other folks so they can make a new game it will be the second
7112280	7118280	big video game released for riot games in their time that they have been operating so that's
7118280	7123400	pretty awesome so they are gonna be handing over those operations to the chief financial officer
7123400	7128080	so as the chief technical officer and the president of the company we don't know what that game is
7128080	7135320	gonna look like we may see some type of phone game who knows or maybe they would get into making who
7135320	7141440	knows an MMO they could do anything so we'll see what riot games decides to develop and to be fair
7141440	7148160	I guess they actually have done tabletop tabletop and small games so the s in riot games is
7148160	7155080	justified but as far as like you know games on video of sorts go this is really the only one
7155080	7160000	they've got so they'll have another one oh maybe in like seven years when they finally finish it
7160000	7163400	right because video games take a little while to work on I don't know if you guys know video
7163400	7168360	games take a while to finish right low-key loot boxes are hard to develop yes right they have to
7168360	7172480	find that I've already had to work in all my monetization stuff you know that's that's why
7172480	7176880	I'm planning first because as I've been shown by the triple-a industry that is the most important
7176880	7181040	does League of Legends have loot boxes I don't think it does they have it's like the in-game
7181040	7185520	gold that you earn and then you use that in-game gold to buy the skins and stuff I thought we had
7185520	7190440	buy it skins because obviously it's a free-to-play game you gotta be making their money some earn in
7190440	7195640	game gold slowly or you put the money now it's like Heroes of the Storm used to be before Heroes
7195640	7201320	of the Storm put in loot boxes and now Heroes of the Storm runs on once again though both free
7201320	7205760	games I don't care that's I'm fine with that if it's a free game right it's just that double
7205760	7212040	dipping feeling that I don't like right all right but we won't rehash the conversation from earlier
7212040	7218120	so let's move on to what Dark Sakura has for us I got some stuff you want to see what I have sure
7218120	7224360	it has to do with Minecraft um never mind just kidding Minecraft still cool well you know how
7224360	7230800	people have built these like amazing recreations of like Helms Deep and all of this business well
7230800	7241080	there is a like a sculpture event that happens in Minecraft there's one that's called the perfect
7241080	7249680	marionette that won first place in the contest and I mean it is massive and it's a full-on
7249800	7256240	sculpture I mean if you look at it closer yeah you can see it's made up of little bricks but I mean
7256240	7263520	just from a distance it looks like a full-on like sculpture sculpture and there are like just some
7263520	7270920	crazy ones like one looks like a an explosion in mid explode and just all these other things it's
7270920	7276400	absolutely amazing and the fact that you know this game has quite literally turned into an art form
7276400	7281200	I was gonna say like some people paint with watercolor some people paint with oils some
7281200	7286640	people are using Minecraft it's crazy but like awesome but it still requires I think some of the
7286640	7292760	same skills that one would have in doing any type of sculpture or other kind of rendering absolutely
7292760	7297920	to do a proper sculpture you have to have your sense of movement you have to have your son well
7297920	7304520	I'd say dynamic movement you also have to have your color balance you have to have scale I mean
7304840	7310840	it's really some amazing work these people have done I knew a gal years ago and I mean years ago
7310840	7315560	like back when I first did Rocky Horror at the bird cage that's how long ago was right I knew
7315560	7322680	this gal and one hobby that she used to enjoy she made paintings but she did them in MS paint I kid
7322680	7329480	you not she did them pixel by pixel she would zoom in all this is she could do her little art pixel
7329480	7334200	by pixel and I I can't help but think you know I've lost touch with her over the years I have no
7334200	7338680	idea where she is today but if she's discovered minecraft like that would be perfect for her
7338680	7343960	because isn't that what minecraft is basically this it's sculpting pixel by pixel right sort
7343960	7349880	of it really is and yeah I've seen I've seen some amazing work done in MS paint so it's really the
7349880	7354240	equivalent oh yeah remember when they tried to get rid of it people lost their shit because they
7354240	7360480	were going to 3d paint or whatever yeah yeah so they're MS paint that's right but there's there's
7360480	7366280	some website now what was that site you could you could go on there and it's just like MS paint you
7366280	7371480	make your drawing but like it saves it on the web and you can like share your drawings other people
7371480	7380160	dang there's some art site and used to be like a game people would do I remember though it was it
7380160	7385600	was a networked art program and I can't remember what it was called but I used to use it all the
7385680	7393600	time where we just get like it was actually I was I was using it with Tiara and our friend Kim and
7393600	7400120	we would and a few other people but we would all get into like have a live server and play in this
7400120	7406200	graphics program dark Tetsuya says oh a cocky no I think I remember oh a cocky though I think that
7406200	7411080	was yeah I'm that's close to what I'm thinking of but that's not it I remember oh a cocky that
7411080	7417880	was like that's more like a type though that was that's like a 1998 thing yeah well really um but
7417880	7424280	now I can't remember what it was called but it was really fun I mean and now especially I'd say
7424280	7428480	that's even one of our earlier precursors to the you know now collaborative applications we have
7428480	7436640	but still I mean I love watching people turn the most unexpected thing into real art you know so
7436640	7443080	it's pretty cool yeah all right well you go artists in Minecraft meanwhile Loki all right
7443080	7449800	so kind of keeping on track with VR of course not to be out valve had some announcements regarding
7449800	7457600	additional components to developing VR systems for device manufacturers basically the new technology
7457600	7464960	is available with the free license that's available for valves room scale VR tracking technology and
7465000	7470120	they say it includes an optical system manufacturing calibration tools and software
7470120	7478720	that aims to make a better user experience and says the new features now they're meant to allow
7478720	7485920	I guess better you know steam VR compatible head-mounted displays also increased sharpness
7485920	7492880	head tracking and that sort of thing so that's cool once again you know it's like we saw with
7492880	7498240	these other companies developing their own VR devices that are kind of giving you compatible
7498240	7503000	with one platform I think Val's taking a smart approach with it too because you know unlike
7503000	7507960	oculus it's kind of like okay we've got our own storefront that's separate from everything valve
7507960	7512400	is like okay hey let's make as many devices as we can that support steam because everybody uses
7512400	7519400	team so why not I'm all for that especially that means I'm gonna get a cheaper headset later on
7519400	7525880	that's still pretty good the price of this technology is coming down and I think that's
7525880	7531240	how more and more people are gonna end up adopting it sooner or later yeah sooner or later and then
7531240	7535040	more and more applications are becoming available better applications because right now we're still
7535040	7540960	kind of in that whole Nintendo DS touchscreen thing where no one knows how to utilize the tech
7540960	7548280	they're just kind of like doing these gimmicky games it's gonna be more smartly used I guess so
7548680	7554600	check that out well and finally in the news tonight something that you've been waiting all
7554600	7559160	show for because Jason referenced it in tonight's introduction a big thanks to Jason by the way he
7559160	7563160	always does those intros to our show we appreciate it I'm gonna miss them next week as he'll be at
7563160	7566880	twitch con so you're stuck with me and looks like unless I can get a guest announcer maybe we'll try
7566880	7575760	to get a guest announcer next week but anyway this is a new playable character for WWE 2k 18
7575800	7580160	I don't know if you guys play those games at all but if you do you can look forward to a brand new
7580160	7585400	playable character in WWE and you might be wondering well which wrestler is this based off
7585400	7591480	of is it is it going to be my twin Sami Zayn well he might be in the game too but this particular
7591480	7599280	character I want to talk about is Colonel Sanders that's right Colonel Sanders KFC his character
7599320	7607480	now there is catch you have to assemble him in create a wrestler but you can actually do it
7607480	7613400	because I guess the guests are sponsored achievements and trophies in this too boy
7613400	7618520	you think loot boxes are bad here's a glimpse at the future on our last they already do that
7618520	7623760	they like in Madden they ever they had advertisements in Madden for like other
7623760	7627840	things not talking about like integrated into the arenas like you know you'd see
7627840	7631760	well they actually integrate into the loading screens like for cell phone service and stuff
7631760	7640280	like that so that's been a thing and sponsored stuff I mean it's silly but this kind of stuff
7640280	7646560	I like it's just dumb I mean who doesn't want to see Colonel Sanders beating down people the
7646560	7654200	question is why is it more you know we need more of this like I know I want Colonel Sanders to be
7654200	7658440	beating up the scary King thing from Burger King that I don't even thinks been the mascot for years
7658440	7663720	we still need our and Wendy because all those companies yeah have you seen Burger King and
7663720	7669960	Wendy on Twitter recently they are savage to each other they are not nice like this
7669960	7677200	2017 you guys when you when you can't wait to be dragged by a corporate brand on Twitter and then
7677200	7682200	we have Arby's being cool with their marketing yeah Arby's Arby's does Arby's the only thing
7682320	7687440	Arby's has going for it is they have a 50 50 50 shake that's like an orange cream shake that's
7687440	7693120	fucking awesome everything else at Arby's fucking terrible I would disagree with that I split a
7693120	7698920	sandwich with Dan and there was so much meat in it that it was two sandwiches worth it was pretty
7698920	7705240	good deal yeah but it's like now if I can get whoever does those ads to make like little you
7705240	7710920	know sculptures for me I would my favorite was a little peach on one they did for Rama it was so
7710920	7718720	cute mm-hmm like a meat sculpture I mean their ads are they take like the the their sandwich
7718720	7725680	boxes and make like anime figures and video game figures and scenes from like the other day they
7725680	7731000	did like an emu yasha one they're so cute oh see that must have been what happened was they
7731000	7735360	converted their box into a sandwich and that's what I ate because it's certainly what it tasted
7735360	7742520	like all right well that is our last story that we have up for the night so that means it's time
7742520	7748480	for the Skype line and you can give us a call over at orange lounge radio all one word on Skype if
7748480	7751920	you'd like to give us a call and talk about anything we've discussed so far tonight or
7751920	7755480	maybe there's something you want to talk about again that's orange lounge radio all one word
7755480	7761480	on Skype and it's lighting up right now so let's get to it and then a little later I'll be checking
7761480	7765720	in to see if there's any last-minute stories as well but I think it's connecting and we have a
7765720	7770760	call on the line hello you're oh it's not connected nope hi you're on orange lounge radio who's this
7770760	7776600	trust me Rob we're fully connected here oh well when you put it that way what's on your mind
7776600	7785000	tonight buddy oh I didn't know the cam was gone I put some clothes on I'm sorry yeah no we know
7785000	7789600	me oh we're echoing by the way so be careful about that yeah we know we still have the cam
7789680	7794520	we're gonna be on this rig for a little while sadly until we can test some new things Loki is
7794520	7800520	gonna be bringing the laptop into this so we can test a conversion over and yeah I'm just paranoid
7800520	7805200	about some new things but Loki has a computer we can play with so that's exciting well I will
7805200	7809560	email you about that because that's how we do our Skype line for our show fabulous I'd like to know
7809560	7814620	more about it well what's on your mind tonight well I just want to say that the Twitter accounts
7814620	7822220	for Arby's Wendy's and Burger King gives me life it gets me through my day and Denny's which God
7822220	7829980	what what shit food no but it's more Wendy's because of lewd Wendy and everybody I know
7829980	7837020	cosplaying her it was yeah do people actually cosplay the Wendy's character and Ronald McDonald
7837020	7840980	of course they do why asking this question there's a reddit for people posting their
7840980	7844940	boobies next to Pokemon of course people can of course you know like with Saints Row freckle
7844940	7851740	bitches that's really a thing that's really a thing because for a while somebody in one Asian
7851740	7858980	countries I forget where actually did a gingka forms of all of the fast-food mascots and there
7858980	7864940	were short run doujins and people were cosplaying them unless you probably missed it when I was
7864940	7869980	posting them on Facebook but when I posted Colonel Sanders a third of women were like daddy
7870460	7879340	oh my god no I I did miss that there's the way he was drawn all the women were like hi I guess
7879340	7886340	I haven't they kind of like redone Colonel Sanders anyway he's not they de-aged him a few years maybe
7886340	7898660	not just a skosh but um it's a skosh what what's good here um I feel you on the YouTube strikes
7898700	7907420	because every time we go to a con and we upload interviews and masquerades I get strikes from Sony
7907420	7914660	Warner all of them because of the music and I'm like these are not monetary videos keep up here
7914660	7919860	for free leave me alone and yeah you're only using if you use a little clip you're not really
7919860	7924580	supposed to be able to I mean that's still like fair use or whatever so it's just okay you're
7924580	7930100	taking problem yeah the problem is the fact when people do their skits they're using commercial
7930100	7935860	music and it's like you can't tell no and I see nothing wrong with I'm not charging it's like
7935860	7942300	people just want to see what they miss because they couldn't go that weekend right yeah I guess
7942300	7947620	but what happens ultimately they put the claim on your video but they don't really get to do
7947620	7951780	anything right they run ads and then they get the revenue okay so they're running ads and they get
7951780	7956180	the revenue and also one or two things happen either they will be like okay you ain't got to
7956180	7961220	worry about it it's fine or you get an email saying your video has been muted in this country
7961220	7967340	this video is our bit this country and then you get work this video has been pulled so I have I
7967340	7973460	had it bookmarked somewhere this little text of paraphrase text of fear use they copy paste in
7973460	7978900	and I send it to that to YouTube and usually within about three days they like okay fine video
7979060	7985380	is good to go it's the whole the whole kid dancing to Prince thing right didn't that go all the way
7985380	7991620	to the Supreme Court and the they they sided with the the person it was like the little kid in the
7991620	7997300	video dancing to a prince song right what do we miss that so I don't know hmm I'm trying to
7997300	8003620	remember yeah yeah they ruled in the favor of the family not the music company or you can just
8003620	8008420	always do what Jim Sterling does which is the whole copyright deadlock so instead of instead
8008420	8012820	of using you know if you know that there's gonna be like a video flag like say you have
8012820	8017380	Nintendo content in there what you do is you throw in random content from other providers
8017380	8022900	that you know are gonna get flagged as well so he'll throw in like Activision stuff and Sony
8022900	8028500	music stuff and the problem is is everybody creates a copyright claim on the the chat on
8028500	8036420	the piece of video and since you know multiple people can't be the owner of that con copyright
8036420	8042100	content nothing happens to it either I get the money or no one gets exactly none of them get
8042100	8047140	the money I even got flagged by Nintendo okay yeah I've had a couple videos back flagged by
8047140	8052100	Nintendo but to be fair it was like my let's remember you know when I first was trying to
8052100	8057780	streamy stuff of Legend of Zelda which you know okay fine they had a they had a case to it I wish
8057780	8063780	there was just a way we could like split revenue instead of but well you can you can you can sign
8063780	8071620	up as one of their partners and you get a tiny pittance of their uh revenue hard pass yeah the
8071620	8076980	thing is my Nintendo video this was when they now this was at the midnight release of the Wii U I'm
8076980	8085700	just like seriously they copyright claimed your Wii U launch video yep that's kind of funny I don't
8085700	8090980	know why oh and uh before I get out of here let me just say real quick when you're talking about
8090980	8098740	Pokemon Go not safe working on all that and we did a all hentai episode and Mako-chan spearheaded
8098740	8105140	that okay so if you're talking about who's the biggest perv around here you talk to her she's

8227940	8231380	you'd like to give us a call to talk about whatever's on your mind tonight regarding
8231380	8236420	video games hopefully but I don't know it's been a short part b compared to part a who knows all
8236420	8240260	right well at least the phones are lighting up tonight so the emails might have disappointed but
8240260	8244900	the phones so far at least are not so the only thing about using this little ipad thing is it
8244900	8249300	takes a little longer to connect and then sometimes the callers hang up anyway so uh
8249300	8253780	that just would happen there so we'll have to wait and see if that person calls back
8254660	8258500	uh loki did you have a last minute story while we try to wait for another call here at orange
8258500	8266500	andreo on skype no not really i mean um bethesda did another twitter like post for wolfenstein

8279940	8285700	there's only one side to this and so if you're a nazi then like fuck off or something to that
8285700	8289060	fact all right well we have another caller on the line so let's get to it hi you're on orange
8289060	8295220	lounge radio who's this hey this is act deaf hey act deaf what's on your mind buddy well finally
8295220	8303140	my sns classic the story came to a good ending yay i heard i i saw this on twitter so you finally
8303940	8310420	got your sns classic right yeah i finally did after two weeks but yeah i finally did so what
8310420	8315460	happened did amazon try to make nice nice or was it just out of the blue suddenly they were like
8315460	8324260	oh we got it now yeah it was totally out of the blue uh on wednesday like wednesday morning uh
8324260	8332660	i got an email for one of my sns classic orders that said i was going to get it next wednesday
8332740	8339620	until the 18th and then i uh and i started searching on twitter if any uh any other person
8340420	8346580	and people uh started getting their emails and yeah it's um uh a lot of people started getting
8346580	8355460	emails and and yeah i i then got another email confirming about my other sns classic order
8355460	8364260	for a friend so it was great but i didn't expect it that amazon the next day sent me a notification
8364260	8371060	about oh you're getting this sns classic tomorrow delivered i'm like whoa really yeah maybe that
8371060	8376180	was their kind of like nice nice thing was that since they took so long instead of doing the two
8376180	8381300	day shipping they went ahead and bumped it up to the overnight shipping maybe that was their little
8381300	8389380	consolation whatever they could do yeah most probably but i'm happy that i got it and probably
8389380	8394980	earlier than i then i expected i would have loved it that they would have fulfilled the order
8395700	8402340	on time at all but it this is better than nothing at least so i don't have to finally have one i
8402340	8407860	bet uh question from our chat over at live.vognetwork.com ssj100 matt says so are you
8407860	8411860	going to keep amazon prime after all this because it seemed like an issue with nintendo
8411860	8415220	more than amazon then again they didn't look good with the treasure truck stuff
8416820	8421780	i'm gonna keep amazon not because of amazon itself because of twitch
8424020	8430980	okay yeah since since i do use the the free subscription thank you for that and
8432340	8437700	and yeah especially because of you uh but still the the promotions i get from twitch like the
8438500	8445940	twitch prime loot boxes and all that stuff it's really great so i i don't want to miss that
8446820	8453220	so instead of like just paying for twitch prime i'll pay for amazon too and keep the
8453940	8460980	all the other stuff too so but i'll probably think twice before or ordering something on amazon at
8460980	8468180	least uh nintendo stuff and and reservations so yeah very interesting and i bet you know to be
8468180	8474260	fair uh amazon probably loves that answer that you know there's more than just the shipping
8474260	8478740	that's the kind of the value in being amazon prime you know at least in you know in their minds you
8478740	8483940	know and again you would have what like the amazon tv because you know we sometimes forget that oh
8483940	8488020	yeah amazon has a tv service as well where you know they've got their shows like transparent
8488020	8492740	does very well and you know some of their other stuff um and then uh you know that what they got
8492740	8496900	a music thing now too and stuff so this is all going to be justification for them to keep upping
8496900	8503140	the price i'm sure um let's see uh bobby blackwolf in chat says i wish twitch allowed the amazon
8503140	8507620	family accounts to use the twitch prime stuff even if it was only one per account i wish i
8507620	8512260	didn't have to tie my fiance's amazon prime account to my twitch to get the prime benefits
8512260	8519220	so well there's maybe uh you actually can because that's what uh my brother and i do that oh so you
8519220	8526900	actually can uh don't know if it's something on on the accounts or something that you have to change
8526900	8534020	oh bobby says not in the us oh well maybe that's that's the thing but uh yeah my brother and i can
8534020	8539780	and it's and it's different account so well rub it in why don't you i'm just kidding all right
8539780	8543060	here's another serious question before we let you go now that you have the super nintendo
8543060	8550500	classic in your hand what do you think it's it's really great i i i'm loving it so far even though
8550500	8557700	i haven't played that much uh because i got it yesterday basically uh but i'm loving it it's
8557700	8565940	really practical because even like last night uh i had a a party with some friends uh a friend of
8565940	8574580	mine uh had a birthday a celebration so since we're all gamers i i pretty much thought well
8574580	8580420	everybody wants to see the esnes classic so i'll take it and we all everybody had a blast
8580420	8586740	everybody wanted to play uh we played street fighter uh kirby's dream course he had lots of
8586740	8593300	fun and me personally i have uh and i haven't played it much uh that much sorry but i'm loving
8593300	8599220	it because of just only because of the games because the 21 games that are there are really
8599220	8607220	great even despite the star fox not being that uh not aging that well but aside from that it's
8607220	8612580	a really great machine and i even love it more than than the next classic despite the next
8612580	8618500	classic like having three games and having all those games also really great but don't know that
8618500	8624180	the next classic seems like a better value even well in the next year we get to do this all over
8624180	8631300	again for the game boy classic so just hold on yeah and i was actually gonna ask something about
8631300	8637780	uh and the relevance of that yeah sure because uh well the the anniversary for uh the third
8637780	8646580	anniversary is gonna be until uh 2019 but i was thinking about uh if if nintendo goes uh and makes
8647380	8656580	a gameboy mini would would just would you have rather have uh like an app on your phone or would
8656580	8664020	you rather see something like the switch that you can have a portable gameboy mini gameboy classic
8664020	8670900	and also hook it up to your tv oh good question i would like to see a simple hdmi out cable i
8670900	8674660	think could fix a lot of that um but then maybe you'd have to be able to plug in a controller
8674660	8681140	that could get a little dicey um um with like a port they have like portable nes emulators i
8681140	8686900	think yeah so i mean yeah something's anything's possible with that but um i would like to more
8686900	8690980	see a link cable i think that would be hilarious if you can actually connect two game boys together
8690980	8695140	with a link cable no i think that's something they might do especially so people can relive
8695140	8699460	the pokemon stuff but if they are going to do a gameboy classic and they put pokemon on it
8699540	8705300	they're gonna have to figure out a way to get these things in the pokemon bank so your idea
8705300	8713220	about it being able to talk to the switch somehow maybe through infrared maybe not too far off so
8713220	8719860	maybe not necessarily like link it to the switch but like having the switch port the tv doc have
8719860	8726900	it like uh uh like an output for tv so you can play like oh you can play gameboy uh games like
8726900	8731300	in the super game boy back in the day that'd be awesome but then again with this being nintendo
8731300	8736020	i'm not gonna hold my breath either or how about we just release the fucking virtual console
8736900	8742180	how about that we just released the virtual console for the switch don't talk crazy now
8742180	8747860	come on i know it's just so weird that you know i would expect them to put something that's been on
8747860	8754740	the last few systems on their current system they want us to all forget that we bought an nes classic
8754740	8759060	so that way when they release balloon fight yet again we're ready to buy it again that's
8759060	8763780	that's what we're waiting on here so yeah early next year probably all right act after i'm gonna
8763780	8767700	let you go to try to see if anyone else wants to get through but thank you and i'm i'm very happy
8767700	8772340	that this amazon story had a happy ending and thank you i think it's good that we follow up
8772340	8777220	on happy endings as well as negative endings so i appreciate the call hey thanks for having me
8777220	8782020	all right take care my friend have a good night you do all right one eight seven seven game olr
8782020	8785700	if you want to do it the old-fashioned way but orange lounge radio on skype is an even better
8785700	8789220	way because for a limited time it's the only way you get to see video here in the studio
8790660	8795140	or just it's really just me it's the ipad pointed at me because we're using an old ipad i can't
8795140	8802260	believe this is now an old ipad but it is it's it's ipad three or the new ipad or whatever they
8802260	8807380	called it at that time that's what we're running skype off of right now orange lounge radio all
8807380	8810980	one word on skype we'll just give it a few minutes to see if anybody wants to get through
8810980	8814900	but if not then we'll probably go ahead and wrap things up i'll check in one more time with my
8814900	8820740	co-host to see if there's any last minute excuse me last minute stories yeah yeah with the latest
8820740	8827060	trend that we've been seeing uh with people coming to twitter and stuff to report sexual abuse and
8827060	8833140	scandals of course there's a few ties with the gaming industry um there was i think was the
8833140	8837220	gaming grumps or something like that there was a whole issue with that but now we've got someone
8837460	8842020	heard that yeah there was one i don't remember it was some group i think it was the game grumps it
8842020	8846580	may have been i could be wrong i heard only read the story once but it was like the head happens
8846580	8852660	that's the head thing to get wrong so right yeah so don't take my word for it um anyways so there
8852660	8858900	was a guy by the name of david ballard who was an environmental and multi or very mental and
8858900	8865060	multiplayer level artist for uncharted two through four and last of us apparently he uh with the
8865060	8870660	twitter talking about some sexual harassment that he received at from his workplace so he said in
8870660	8875780	late 2015 i was sexually harassed the naughty dog by a lead my work environment became extremely
8875780	8881300	toxic afterward in february 2016 i had a mental breakdown at work and suddenly playstation hr
8881300	8885620	became involved well i told him about the harassment the end of the call and fired me
8885620	8889860	the next day they decided the company was moving in a different direction and my job was no longer
8889860	8893380	needed they tried to silence me by offering me twenty thousand dollars if i signed a letter
8893380	8897940	agreeing to the termination as well as not to disclose it with anyone else i declined to sign
8897940	8903380	i've been unemployed for 17 months since this is when the interviewers um asked why i left
8903380	8907700	naughty dog i said i was burned out by the crunch ashamed to get to the root of the problem of being
8907700	8912740	sexually harassed i'm speaking out now because of the strength of i've seen others come forward
8912740	8917860	about their experiences in tv film industry it's the hardest thing i've ever had i've ever done in
8917860	8923460	laywin uh kill my drive or love for video game industry and my passion for life and then of
8923460	8928740	course they naughty dog released the statement as well as we've been recently uh we have recently
8928740	8933140	read on social media the next employee of naughty dog dave allard claims he was sexually harassed
8933140	8938020	when he worked at naughty dog we have not found any evidence of having received allegations from
8938020	8942580	mr ballard as he was harassed in any way of naughty dog or sony or active entertainment
8942580	8946900	harassment inappropriate conduct have no place at naughty dog or sony interactive entertainment
8946900	8952420	we have taken and always will report sexual harassment and other workplace grievances very
8952420	8961460	seriously and blah blah blah so so i don't i don't know where to go without getting too soapboxy with
8961460	8966580	this whole thing but it's very obvious that i think there's been a lot of dark shit that's
8966580	8971220	happened out there and finally people are putting their fucking foot down and saying we're not going
8971220	8977700	to fucking take this anymore and even the once thought impenetrable hollywood dark stories of
8977700	8982900	casting couches and things like that you know finally people are saying we are sick of this
8982900	8987380	shit period and it's just a sad reminder that everything you're seeing happening in hollywood
8987380	8993220	right now it's not unique to hollywood it happens pretty much in every industry and it needs to stop
8993220	8999380	and some shithole guy who was like a lawyer in the industry was going out saying well now we're
8999380	9003780	gonna hear nothing but this in the future like it's a bad thing that it's coming out to light
9003780	9008900	how long is have a lot of people probably repress this exactly well right now on facebook there
9008900	9012900	actually is the people posting me too it's happening on twitter it's happening everywhere
9012900	9019300	yeah people need to fucking see it it happens a lot more than you think it is and it needs to stop
9019300	9026580	and people that you'll never be a part of it and never judge anybody by what they wear no one is
9026580	9034900	ever fucking asking for it it's just disgusting i'm nothing is consent except consent exactly
9034900	9043460	and lack of an answer is not consent so anyway all right a good uh a good uh lesson to end the show
9043460	9049060	on tonight but uh you know we i know we say uh game industry needs to do better here's an example
9049060	9053780	and i realize it's a dicey situation there's you know his story a naughty dog story and so forth
9053780	9060900	but you know what um it's probably this is probably one unfortunately unfortunately of
9060900	9066660	many stories that are out there and um people need to do better and be better people and not
9066660	9073380	prey on um other people yeah i was unable to find out which site that was there was a pretty major
9073380	9081220	site i just don't remember i may be remembering who it was yeah correctly i saw it like i can't
9081220	9087940	i can't find it so we'll presume everyone to be innocent for now all right well since our
9087940	9091780	skype line is not lighting up with any more calls i'm going to assume that is it for the calls
9091780	9096500	tonight and i think it's about time we go ahead and we wrap things up here at orange launch radio
9096500	9101060	for the night but i do once again want to thank you guys for participating with our program whether

9140420	9148340	for it but i have to get it off my chest um our cat sanrio is is not doing well um she's breathing
9148340	9152980	kind of funky and we're a little worried uh it could be something that's hopefully easily cleared
9152980	9158740	up but it may be something that's um not um she's 17 years old so we're kind of mentally prepared
9158740	9163700	that you know this this may be something really bad um but that's something we do we are we do
9163700	9168900	have a vet thing set up for tomorrow so i just appreciate all the uh all the kind thoughts and
9168900	9172980	anything whatever it is that you believe in out there that you can put in the universe that'll

9179220	9183780	my mind all night so uh dark sakura your final thought tonight hopefully something a little
9183780	9193300	better sorry um well i'm not exactly the biggest bundle of positivity sorry um but uh we're
9193700	9203220	we're going to have a donut donuts donuts all right that's a great note and have a donut have
9203220	9210100	a donut i found it sorry um it was not gaming grumps so not the tarnished surname screen junkies
9210100	9218100	a guy named andy sigmar uh signor was the accused of it apparently um there's a woman by the name
9218260	9224340	that came out and talked about it um saying that you know uh and apparently a lot more people i
9224340	9229780	think came out about it as well showing the new texts about how they were um he was sexually
9229780	9237620	harassing several people over dms on twitter and all sorts of things so that was the case and so
9237620	9244820	they're looking at screen junkies and defy media they're looking into it but he's been um i think
9244820	9249620	suspended while they conduct their investigation so that's what's been going on well thank you for
9249620	9254660	your commitment to righting any wrongs that you may put out there here on the show garbage humans
