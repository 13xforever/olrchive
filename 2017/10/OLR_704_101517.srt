17
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:39,840
Master Loki over there yes what you don't want more Legos no I I always want more Legos

18
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,320
is whether it's gonna happen how how many times have you stepped on a Lego brick barefoot

19
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,240
because we all know that's like one of the worst things that could possibly happen to

20
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,760
you it's not I used to walk on them so I mean it's fine so I found out this week that

21
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:57,540
Loki and I both like the same show I know we don't talk a lot about TVs and movies here

22
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,120
on OLR because you know we have other shows here at the voice geeks network where we do

23
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:05,160
tape live Sunday nights at six o'clock Pacific's nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby

24
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,220
Black Wolf show we have a lot of great shows here to talk about that stuff we don't really

25
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,860
get to talk about it here as much but I found out that you and I are both big fans of the

26
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:16,720
show called the good place yes it's a really funny show it is hilarious I started binge

27
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,960
watching I don't even know what made me do it I think I think just a lot of my friends are

28
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:25,120
talking about how funny it was as I was like all right it's like a 25 minute show I won't

29
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:31,040
take that long I like marathoned the first season in like two and a half days yeah we

30
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,280
ran out of episodes so yeah and there's only it's only on its second season so it's pretty

31
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,080
easy yeah it started second season yeah so I liked it a lot I thought it was really funny

32
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:45,400
so I don't want to spoil it too much well the the premise is that the main character who's

33
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:51,640
Kristen Bell who was Veronica Mars right but she's a little older now she she died and she

34
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:57,240
wakes up in the good place which is the opposite of the bad place so she would you know because

35
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:01,160
obviously I don't think the show wants to get too religious so it's about her you know adventures

36
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:06,440
in the good place and the people that she meets and the maybe not so good things that are happening

37
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,920
well yes in the main twist which they kind of reveal in the first episode is that she's not

38
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,880
really supposed to be there yeah it's a mistake yes yes that is in the first episode so he's not

39
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:22,960
really spoiling anything too crazy and so it's kind of her trying to fake it and you know try

40
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:27,600
to make it into you know this thing and then all sorts of crazy stuff happens yeah so who's your

41
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:33,200
favorite character because my favorite character on that whole show is Evil Janet pretty good I

42
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:42,720
I also like I can't remember his name the the dude that plays like the silent monk Oh

43
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:50,960
Johnny Johnny yeah yeah yes but yes it's true his trooper yes yes not to spoil anything but

44
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:59,240
yeah hisself itself yes I like how his interactions uh let's see I know it's John who was his name I

45
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:04,280
think John it was his name anyway I when I watch a show like that I can tie it see watch I can tie

46
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:10,520
anything back to video games because the way they present that the good place is kind of built is

47
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:15,800
that like there's this architect that creates the good place for a certain number of people it's

48
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:22,360
totally like the sims like I swear the people that invented that show probably thought how

49
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,640
could we turn the sims into a TV show like is it just me or does that does it feel like a lot

50
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:35,880
yeah yeah without all the like death traps and stuff yeah without all of that so I'm going to

51
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:41,840
chat over at live.vognetwork.com a couple people starting with a Kossen saying you can talk to me

52
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,080
about the Orville which I'm hearing a lot of good things about I haven't gotten around to that yet

53
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,640
because I've been watching Star Trek Discovery which you know I realize a lot of people are

54
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:56,800
watching Orville instead of Star Trek Discovery which cheap plug I did appear on starboard power

55
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,080
coupling this week so if you want to check out our synopsis of episode 4 go check out those kids

56
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,480
the starboard power coupling podcast which is part of vognetwork it's it's there under our podcast

57
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:10,160
course I got to get in the stranger thing season 2 when they come oh shit that's like only two

58
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,920
weeks away that's two weeks exciting and that's as we got into last week that's a game now too

59
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:21,800
yep it is dark soccer is there anything you're watching on the telly nope no I don't really

60
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,760
like TV but you've watched a few things like you guys watch the Castlevania anime which I still

61
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:31,320
need to do I watch things when they come out and then I get it over with yeah so I watched

62
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:35,560
stranger things I'm gonna watch the next season I watched Jessica Jones and I watched Luke Cage

63
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:40,400
and I watched Defenders okay and I tried to watch iron fist but it was completely fucking ridiculous

64
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:46,720
some stuff I'm not watching anything okay okay right now I see what you mean so like you you

65
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,720
wait and then you like binge it all at once and then it's done I get it okay oh the one thing I

66
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:56,200
am continuously watching every time an episode comes out is Dragon Ball super okay that's it

67
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:01,760
and you know I'll have RuPaul's Drag Race in January yeah so will you yeah I'll watch Drag

68
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:07,960
Race that one now no I know that's a lie if you're gonna try to tell me as for anything on TV right

69
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:14,520
now no I'm not watching anything I'm mostly a YouTube watcher so I watch the cuisine of the

70
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:20,040
18th century with James Townsend and son speaking of well sorry if I don't want to interrupt or

71
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:24,520
anything but I was gonna say speaking of YouTube actually one channel that's been putting out stuff

72
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:29,680
in the interim is awesome games done quick they do these little I don't know what they're called

73
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,000
but they're like small little turn it like tournament runs type that they're doing so

74
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:41,280
they did one the other day that was it's a link to the past randomizer and so what that means is

75
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:48,040
basically all the drops like the different items are randomized in the actual the Legend of Zelda

76
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:53,840
randomizer yes so they it's final fantasy randomizer like original NES Final Fantasy

77
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,120
randomizer and I think it's a similar concept yeah so that was kind of fun I watched that for

78
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,360
a good couple hours the other day but yeah they've been putting out content like almost once a week

79
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:09,960
but the other thing that I'm watching regularly on YouTube is outside Xbox mm-hmm which is a UK

80
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:17,160
like gaming top best-of list and they don't just stick to Xbox stuff I'm just saying that you know

81
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:22,520
it's really funny they have some good perspectives and I've actually picked up a few like I didn't

82
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:27,400
know the threshold trick in Mass Effect 2 where if you do when you're doing grunt's loyalty mission

83
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:31,520
there's a particular screw that you can stand behind and just shoot and shoot and shoot and

84
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:38,920
the thing can't hit you but you can hit it I know about that there you go I just go headfirst into

85
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,800
everything I always forget that YouTube is like a thing that people can like legitimately watch

86
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,400
shows on like it's a very different sort of thing and you'd think I'd be more aware because I've

87
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,760
always been very like rah rah rah do a podcast make a podcast so you'd think I'd be the same

88
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:58,000
way for YouTube and TV and I am but I just don't find that I have the time to sit down I watch

89
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:04,080
little things here and there but I don't get into a lot of series I also watch a lot of the NHK TV

90
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:10,480
shows so I mean I don't watch them regularly so I can't say I am watching them but I'll go through

91
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:16,160
just big bursts of watching like begin Japan ology or bento or was it called lunch on it's all about

92
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:23,840
bento and you know certain like arts and crafts shows I'm and I watch a lot of history stuff on

93
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:31,720
YouTube because I love fucking I love documentaries I love history I like documentaries too but like

94
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:38,640
more like socially based ones I don't watch a lot of like the history like wars and stuff I like the

95
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:44,800
social I like the history ones where they go into how events unfolded and affected people more of the

96
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:51,440
I guess combination of anthropology sociology and history so that because I think that if you don't

97
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:57,520
look at history through the lens of someone who experienced it then you can't see how it applies

98
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:02,880
to modern life and too many people don't want to look at history oh that was terrible it was a war

99
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,120
ba ba ba ba ba you know what I mean but when you look at it through the people's eyes what they

100
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:14,840
suffered and then we see what's happening today oh my god you will cry because fuck what's going

101
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:21,800
on right now I like watching it's totally trash but the internet historian on YouTube and he does

102
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:28,840
kind of documentary type features of trolling in memes and stuff and it's it's it's actually kind

103
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:32,560
of fascinating because it's stuff that I would have never heard about but they go into great

104
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:39,360
detail about stuff like balloon boy or you know dash con and all those weird stuff that they do

105
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:47,880
just I don't know it's pretty funny I mean it's it's trash because it's like these people are

106
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:52,800
trolling people right but it's it's entertaining to watch from an outside perspective right okay

107
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,880
well speaking I do want to mention real quick because I don't think it made our show world

108
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,000
tonight but I saw it floating around out there because you brought up awesome games done quick

109
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,800
yeah the schedule is out for the next awesome games done quick which would be the winter one

110
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:12,240
in a couple mad why are you mad well disappointed why is that because Super Metroid isn't on the

111
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,360
last Super Metroid I don't know if that's about whatever happened you know last year but I'm also

112
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:23,720
disappointed because our pal and friend of the show Flaco Jones submitted for PT and again sadly

113
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,520
did not get in but you know they got a lot of talented people I was looking because they

114
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:32,640
actually have posted like what they accepted and what they rejected oh my god like there's a lot I

115
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,040
mean it's no wonder Flaco is submitted several times it keeps getting bumped because there's

116
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,040
just tons of stuff that gets submitted maybe they can do another one three times a year so many

117
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:46,480
speedrunners out there for sure maybe he can do his own marathon for charity and donate it to the

118
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,280
awesome games done quick actually I would I would love to see you know I know we've been talking

119
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:55,680
about it for a long time and maybe we're gonna need some help from some people that are better

120
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:03,040
event planners than we are such as the folk that folks that do sack gamer collective I believe is

121
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,200
the new name you know our pals over there because especially with all the wildfires that's been

122
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,600
going on here in Northern California I'd really love to see I don't know if you guys know but

123
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:17,360
like an old friend of the show DDR angel she was like luckily last I heard everything's okay but I

124
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,840
know like her life got turned upside down by the evacuations and all that stuff and I'm sure she's

125
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:25,200
not the only one that we know of that listens to the show that's that's really run into a problem

126
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,880
so it'll be really cool if we can kind of do something to help because it's been you know

127
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,960
even here in Sacramento I mean we're fine guys we're like a hundred miles from everything but

128
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:38,040
like the air has been toxic here like I kind of have to stay indoors it's fine today but I mean

129
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:42,260
like Monday Tuesday we're it's still hazy though yeah so I mean did you see from San Francisco as

130
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:49,440
well oh yeah it was pretty terrible I just like the post that's not fog yeah this time um but the

131
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:57,280
I do well Dan has worked done a marathon for Child's Play before and we've got all the stuff

132
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:02,880
set up at my house that we could stream okay so all we have to do is just set up an account for

133
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:09,240
donations and then donate the whole thing to whichever charity is handling the wildfires it

134
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,960
wouldn't be that hard yeah we'll figure something out maybe hopefully in the coming months because

135
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:18,120
you know it's not like the needs are gonna go away in two months so we'll see what we can do

136
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:25,200
so and all else fails there are charities lots of worthy causes I'm associated with one so yeah

137
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,200
anyway I did want to mention in chat real quick because I think this is a good point over at live

138
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:34,220
dot vog network comm Bobby black wolf who's on before us says in chat we all know super

139
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:39,080
Metroid will be a donation incentive so there is that maybe we don't know the the final final

140
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:45,400
answers yet so that's a that's good Brad from pod culture says 24 hours of vog game streaming

141
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:51,640
I'm sure there's enough of us I hey even if we raised a hundred bucks I'd be thrilled that's

142
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:56,720
a hundred bucks they didn't have before so you know if it's a small turnout who cares you don't

143
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,160
do it for the size of turnout you do it for the the donations and awareness even if it's just a

144
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:06,400
little awareness so all right well anyhow I do want to get into some other gaming content and

145
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,400
some of the news would talk about at the top of the show because I know we went on some nerd

146
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:14,920
tangents but it's been I don't think we have a lot a lot of news tonight but of course I say that

147
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:21,200
and those are the four-hour shows so let's kick off tonight's talking about loot boxes because it

148
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,440
seems like just in general the concept of loot boxes has been in the news a lot especially this

149
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:31,600
seems to be getting worse and what if the problem here's what it is is a lot of people dismiss loot

150
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,840
boxes as oh it's cosmetic oh this and that right we've been seeing lately with a lot of games that

151
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:44,080
they're specifically creating these games to push loot boxes or they're taking aspects of the game

152
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:49,600
out to put them in loot boxes because they can make extra money and loot boxes are finding like

153
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,480
a free-to-play game or even fine like I even I don't blame overwatch too much because that is

154
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:01,440
just cosmetic stuff well I I kind of think that overwatch is the reason everybody's course of

155
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:07,480
course watch wasn't the first bite but like blizzard fans are like I'm trying to think of

156
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:14,000
a tactful way to say this but blizzard fans are different than a lot of other types of gamers and

157
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,460
I say that having done a World of Warcraft podcast for several years which you guys all know

158
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:23,120
Hoard House was on the network okay so I was a part of that community and it's a great community

159
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:29,000
I'm not talking negative at all I'm just saying that the blizzard fans are very loyal to blizzard

160
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,160
products and when blizzard does this is why I realized that even though not everybody gets it

161
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:40,200
like why destiny 2 is in the battle net launcher it's a brilliant move by Activision to sell more

162
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:44,960
destiny 2 on PC to an audience that probably didn't check it out on console I mean I'm I'm

163
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:49,440
sorry you may not like totally understand that but the way the the blizzard crowd is if they

164
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:55,500
can spend the money that they're making on gold in World of Warcraft or what have you on destiny

165
00:14:55,500 --> 00:15:00,120
to another game they're gonna do it so like that was that was a move that was frankly brilliant by

166
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:07,440
Activision I mean whether it's not the nice thing to do or not but anyway Activision's been aggressive

167
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:13,120
pretty bad with this stuff and not only me even before destiny 2 with Call of Duty modern warfare

168
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,880
remastered they just injected loot boxes in there it's like that what the fuck the original game

169
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:23,480
didn't have that and now of course I'm assuming with the new Call of Duty and with advanced

170
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:29,840
warfare I think even has that system shadow of war was a pretty big one that they just kind of

171
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:34,360
added this up in there and then of course the one that released Italy got people pissed off

172
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:39,480
it will force up the new force the game has that which is more of like a pay-to-earn type scheme

173
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:44,680
but then the more of a pay-to-win type scheme with battlefront 2 member valve for it too they're like

174
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:49,080
oh hey yeah we're gonna release all these maps for free it's you're not gonna we're not just gonna

175
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:54,240
sell you really shitty base game and then force you to buy all the maps now we're gonna offer it

176
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:59,240
to you for free but of course then they're gonna throw in this loot box system that's got a lot of

177
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:03,680
mods that actually do affect gameplay you know something if you actually level up and that is

178
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:10,360
actually I believe the system to level up in the game is tied to the loot boxes so it's unavoidable

179
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:19,160
that's really really similar to overwatch overwatch does the free maps the free characters and as you

180
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:25,480
level up you get loot box no I it's the other way around oh you don't level up get loot boxes you

181
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:30,560
have to get loot boxes to level oh that's that's a little yeah that's like a little what can we

182
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:35,120
change to be a little shadier and okay interesting so I do want to get some comments in our shower

183
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,400
because I know you have some news like why are we bringing this up tonight loot boxes are nothing

184
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:44,280
new in the gaming community but there's definitely some activity we're seeing this week but I want to

185
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:49,320
get to our chat over at live dot vog network comm a stoppie and chat says I used to have no opinion

186
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:53,800
on it but yes I'm seeing a lot of instances now where content seems to be cut out and held hostage

187
00:16:53,800 --> 00:17:01,480
in loot boxes let's see Carson says I like the loot boxes that do boxed CE and LE version of

188
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:07,040
PC games but they're too expensive for me dungeon buster says loot boxes are just extensions of the

189
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:13,680
mobile model thanks mobile gaming kaijuto and chat says the reason why they only do cosmetic

190
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:19,920
is because we don't like pay-to-win look at what's going on with 2k 18 loot boxes have been going

191
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:25,600
around since we had browser games but it certainly does feel like you know browser games I think are

192
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,680
kind of one thing because browser games are free to play mobile games are free to play right but

193
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:37,360
overwatch was $60 yeah that's not even this and it's not well oh right I know I'm only picking on

194
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:42,040
a watch no watch is a good example because I think it's done correctly I don't think there's

195
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:47,400
really an issue there because it's it is strictly cosmetic for me I don't give a shit about the

196
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,640
cosmetic stuff so it's it's cool to get one every now and then it's like oh that's a pretty cool

197
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,680
skin I'm not like oh man I really got it like but you know there's people that are like that

198
00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:01,000
but there are kind of on them right and wait how you choose to spend your money which if you want

199
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,160
to buy a hundred loot boxes so you can get that symmetric dragon skin well hey it is a pretty

200
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:12,840
sweet skin but with that though I mean there's definitely been a lot of people that have been

201
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:17,480
opposed to it because yeah it is something that's kind of out that whole free-to-play model but you

202
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:23,320
paid $60 for the game and then because it's not really the full game because you need all the DLC

203
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:28,440
because that's been sliced out of the game as well so you to pay for the season pass as well

204
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:35,320
and then they want you to pay for these loot boxes or paid modifications as Bethesda likes

205
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:42,600
to do with you oh hey this modification is it happens to be 800 you know virtual currency

206
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,760
points or whatever but you can only buy the currency points in 750 so you really have to

207
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:54,320
spend $15 you get to get this other thing it it's just they tried to like cheat people in the best

208
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,680
way possible because they they know they make money and they know well these fans of the game

209
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:03,840
they're just gonna they're gonna be fine with it because it's just okay though they'll be annoyed

210
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,560
but they'll still buy the game and yeah that seems to be the case with a lot of like destiny

211
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:15,840
2 players they're fine with it because they the game is good but you know the loot boxes are still

212
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:21,120
there attempting people miss dark Sakura over there in the fluffy chair I'm curious on your

213
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,440
hot take on loot boxes because I know you don't really do overwatch but you have done mobile

214
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,360
games you've done Mass Effect had him yeah Dragon Age had him so what's your hot take on loot boxes

215
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:34,640
are you okay with them are you kind of I'm okay that I don't multiplayer that much in overwatch

216
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,520
makes me sick so it's not my problem right but what about the other games you do play that have

217
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:43,560
them what games do I play that have those effects I don't do multiplayer in it anymore okay and I

218
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:49,060
never did multiplayer in Dragon Age okay so okay I thought you kind of did more loot boxes back when

219
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:53,440
like Mass Effect 3 was I did it for Mass Effect 3 but I didn't pay for any of them it's not always

220
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,440
multiplayer games either shadow of war and granted it has a multiplayer aspect to it but right it's

221
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:05,120
in the single-player right well she doesn't have needed to be fair neither do I yeah I none of this

222
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:10,160
it doesn't matter to me okay I mean the only loot boxes I care about is the Pusheen loot crate oh

223
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:18,080
you mean physical loot box right well this tangible stuff you know what actually let's talk about that

224
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:24,480
because doesn't this phenomenon kind of exists in the real world any no okay any convention I go

225
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:31,160
to any of them always have for sale those little question mark bricks that for like 20 bucks and

226
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:36,720
they say two of them have a NES classic or something really highly desirable in them the

227
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:42,640
rest of them have bullshit unload overstock stuff but because it's nerd stuff nobody really gets

228
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,240
upset because they're like okay yeah that's like a raffle or gambling it's an I am Groot ruler

229
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:57,440
something you know it's oh I needed a ruler but yeah I mean so there's been a lot of like kind of

230
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,280
pushback with loot boxes because of all I mean recently there's just been a ton of games tons

231
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:07,120
of big games coming out of it all have them and all kind of unnecessarily have them basically so

232
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,600
what's some of the stuff going around this week if you don't mind so of course you know they've

233
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:18,640
turned to the different ratings boards to kind of get their hot take on it as well the ESRB says

234
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:26,000
you know they don't consider loot boxes to be gambling they just you know it's because I think

235
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:32,640
mainly you don't actually you know win money from it you they don't see it as something of like

236
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:38,320
value you're not really like it's it's not the same format as gambling basically they say yes

237
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,680
our B does not consider loot boxes to be gambling while there is an element of chance in these

238
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:47,480
mechanics the player is always guaranteed to receive in-game content even if the player

239
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:52,760
unfortunately receives something they don't want we think of it as a similar principle to a

240
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:57,480
collectible card game sometimes you open a pack and get brand new holographic card you had your

241
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,480
eye on for a while but other times you'll end up with a pack of cards you already have so they're

242
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:06,320
saying that because you get something each time it's not really considered gambling I think they

243
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:11,080
make a darn good point with the fact that magic the gathering isn't considered a gambling and it's

244
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:17,240
a similar type of deal yeah I can support that I mean you're right like you can't turn around and

245
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:22,120
sell you know Blizzard walked away from that Diablo 3 auction house a long time ago and they

246
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,160
don't really have anything like that in any of their other games maybe if something like that

247
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:30,800
still existed and I mean I know Diablo 3 doesn't do loot boxes but let's make believe it did you

248
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:35,440
know then maybe that would be gambling because you could turn around and sell the stuff that you get

249
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:40,920
in the blue boxes that doesn't exist to be clear that doesn't exist but could could could it in five

250
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:45,960
years is that like is that how we're gonna get out of it comp being gambling is that you're saying

251
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:52,920
that you always get something well you know what if what you get is essentially worthless it it is

252
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:59,640
it is a game of chance but it's not gambling there's a difference again magic the gathering

253
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:05,440
isn't gambling right so and you know but but that analogy is absolutely right in magic the

254
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:10,480
gathering you're not gonna get Sarah Angel it's like the one card I can't remember the name of

255
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,880
you're not gonna get a Sarah Angel every booster pack just because you want one in fact you might

256
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,440
buy like some of my friends did in high school that we all played you might buy 20 packs trying

257
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:26,520
to get a hypnotic specter oh no that I did am I have my nailing these carny has been a long time

258
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:32,040
I just don't originate or sitting there screaming or a shivin dragon my magic knowledge is is in the

259
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:39,760
pooper or you know back in the black border days oh I got a Lotus let me did you play like a black

260
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:44,440
I bet you played like a black deck black like my tournament deck was a black deck with Lord of the

261
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:51,520
Pit and hypnotic specters I had a black white and red deck my tournament deck I found out I played

262
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:57,440
it just to find out that it actually got banned the next tournament oh shoot I made it like fourth

263
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:03,960
place okay all right well there you go see we and we weren't gambling at all all right and then of

264
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,720
course Peggy they have their approach you know basically saying our approach is similar that of

265
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:15,360
the SRB I think all ratings board do you SK in Germany as well the main reason is for that we

266
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,960
cannot define what constitutes gambling that is the responsibility of the National Gambling

267
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:25,160
Commission our gambling content descriptor is given to games that simulate or teach gambling

268
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:30,740
as it's done in real life casinos racetracks etc have Gambling Commission were to state that loop

269
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:36,200
boxes are a form of gambling then we would have to adjust our criteria to that interesting so this

270
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:41,780
is about the advisory and why a game like Vegas Stakes on the Super Nintendo let's say because I

271
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:44,960
don't know why but it's the first casino game that comes to my mind probably because it's still one

272
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:50,640
of the best of this day Vegas Stakes would get a gambling warning because if you remember that

273
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:56,000
game it was about you actually played blackjack you played crap what were the games in that it

274
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,320
was like blackjack craps slot machine I remember they were like fuck you know maybe it was like

275
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,720
five games in there I remember that was the one where like random people would come up to you

276
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,560
while you're playing the game and there would be like the little like that's what kind of made it

277
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:10,560
unique is that there'd be the little like they'd say oh can you help me by giving me a hundred

278
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:15,240
dollars or whatever and sometimes they'd it was that was gambling too sometimes you'd they'd come

279
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,880
back or they'd run away forever you never see the money again sometimes they'd be like I won a

280
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,440
lottery and thing and I'm gonna give you part of the prize because you helped me and you made more

281
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:28,280
money you remember that game no anyone Jamie you know the old classic games very well Vegas Stakes

282
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:32,080
Super Nintendo remember that I didn't play it I swear to God next time you're gone classic I don't

283
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:38,340
I don't like gambling really so being that you know the ESRB and Peggy can't really rule on it

284
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:45,180
some other sites have taken to make a more you know apparent approach against this basically saying

285
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:50,860
listen we're gonna take a stand against this we're not really you know for it let's make a way that

286
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:55,820
we can make people aware of this so one of those sites that's taking aim at this is open critic

287
00:25:55,820 --> 00:26:03,660
and they're actually looking into ways that they can basically display what kind of loot boxes are

288
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:08,980
in a game your weather game has loot boxes you know if it's pay to win that type of stuff what

289
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:13,700
about the whole thing and I know you don't really have an answer for this but I know a couple months

290
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:18,180
ago on the show we were talking about how China was pushing an issue where because you know

291
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:24,620
overwatch is doing well there too but China was gonna make them publish what the percentage was

292
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:29,940
of rare because we kind of don't know like what the percentage is like what is the chance that

293
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:35,780
you're gonna get symmetrous dragon skin you don't know like you just know that sometimes rare stuff

294
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:40,540
shows up but China was gonna make them publish the numbers but then I think I heard that recently

295
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:47,700
blizzard found a way around it like they now you buy currency in the game and that's all you're

296
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:52,380
spending money on you use the currency to get loot boxes or something like that like they're able

297
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:57,020
they're able to get around they got around it somehow in China exactly we still don't know what

298
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:01,580
those rates they were the making sort of gambling laws regarding loot boxes they would just change

299
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:06,540
the way that they're doing so they can skirt around them so that's one site at least that's

300
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:10,780
looking to do that but let me let me ask you this let me ask you this hard question and everybody in

301
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:16,540
chat as well would you base your decision on if you're gonna buy a game or not on whether it has

302
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:20,620
loot boxes and I asked that to our chat as well live fog network calm while I asked Loki and

303
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:26,740
depends what kind of blue boxes if it's gonna be like you know overwatch where it's just cosmetic

304
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:32,060
stuff for multiplayer then yeah I'm fine with that if it's something that's gonna be basically

305
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:39,980
heavily involved in the game like shadow war or Forza or you know some of these that have basically

306
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:45,220
in one game you've had it you know as a feature now it's a consumable and you that features gone

307
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:49,880
because it's locked behind loot boxes where it seems like a you know massive cash grab from the

308
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:55,500
publisher then no I probably would avoid the game just fucking wait for Nintendo to decide they're

309
00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:00,980
gonna start doing loot boxes I guess I kind of do they in the mobile games I I bet this

310
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:05,540
Animal Crossing mobile does loot boxes just you wait that's fine once again that's yeah

311
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:12,140
it's a free game you know what you're you're paying nothing for the game they can throw

312
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:16,700
whatever the fuck they want at you I mean honestly that's it's my that's my opinion if if it's a free

313
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:22,060
game you're playing you're losing nothing if you quit that game it's it the problem comes to like

314
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:25,900
if it's Super Mario Odyssey and everything is locked behind a loot box then I'm gonna be

315
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:30,820
fucking pissed because I paid $60 for the game so this metacritic or open critic or whatever was

316
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:38,700
you said was looking at the advisories they need to probably clarify what kind of loot box it is

317
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:42,060
besides just putting out a loot box warning like there because there's a difference between

318
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:49,360
cosmetic only loot boxes and or if it's like a loot box that's in you know with in-game currency

319
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:53,760
that you earn in the game you don't pay real money for dungeon buster just brought that up in our

320
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:58,540
chat room saying the new Assassin's Creed game has that you can buy them but you can also use

321
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:01,720
in-game currency and they've been very clear to say you can use in-game currency to buy the loot

322
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:08,200
boxes right well that's you can do that and I think shadow war as well but you know of course

323
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:14,720
they're gonna make the in-game currency hard to get and you know take forever and yeah tiger

324
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,280
call on chat says these so-called loot boxes seem to only apply to multiplayer games you won't see

325
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:24,440
loot boxes on single-player games was that the well shadow or the shadow war technically does

326
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:30,320
have a multiplayer portion but the the thing though is most of that is meant for the single

327
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,760
player game like in the end of the game it's very grindy and that's where that comes into play but

328
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:40,160
yeah it just so happened me most games nowadays are they have a multiplayer portion to them right

329
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:44,200
so it's gonna be hard to find a game that doesn't but like some of the games that they mentioned

330
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:50,400
NBA 2k 18 has them you know I remember Oh Bobby Blackwell says fours of seven has loot boxes a

331
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:55,160
single player yes so maybe this trend is yeah continuing and some folks in chat you know Rama

332
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:59,360
dungeon buster both saying no this would not influence their decision dungeon buster elaborating

333
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:04,500
I don't like the trend is represented in battlefront 2 but not all games implement loot box rewards the

334
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:10,960
same way so hmm and dungeon buster saying I've been playing shadow of war and have not opened a

335
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:18,000
single loot box I agreed but not checkmarked the legal agreement at the start interesting okay so

336
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,040
I mean and to be fair I can't really judge the loot boxes and shadow war because I'm not playing

337
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:26,480
that game oh yeah they said that most of the game you don't really need you know the loot boxes are

338
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,800
really you can use them but it's not gonna be like super important it's just towards the end

339
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:35,640
of the game the endgame stuff that to get the true ending you're gonna really need to level

340
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:41,160
your characters because it's really hard to defeat the last or you know stave off the last

341
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:47,920
few raids or whatever and that's where it becomes more tempting to get the true ending so speaking

342
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:54,720
of loot boxes now we had some continued development and shadow of war actually right so now this is

343
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,480
one of those things that doesn't surprise me how the player base is responded right Loki yes so

344
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:04,720
of course you know with anything that people don't like they're gonna hack it they're gonna mod it so

345
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:11,640
that's what happened apparently they have found a way to get loads of the Mirian which I guess is

346
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:19,880
the in-game currency to keep buying loot chests forever and so I guess there's I'm using like

347
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:27,440
just basic programs like the cheat engine allow you to get the in-game currency so that's not

348
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:36,000
unexpected hackers gonna hack no patch it over put some anti-cheat yeah isn't the economy or

349
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,320
whatever you want to call it like already kind of hosed I'm really surprised it is like because

350
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:46,240
blizzard somehow seems to have never had this happen but I would assume like blizzard games

351
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,240
pretty much at this point have to always be connected that's the other thing about blizzard

352
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,840
games blizzard breaks all these rules that you'd like you know oh the community is never gonna

353
00:31:54,840 --> 00:32:00,280
allow that our community's gonna push back on this blizzard gets away with it every every damn

354
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:10,680
time blizzards up on that stage Oh Diablo 3 you're so beautiful right you're a model but you look

355
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:17,280
like Linda eventually stuff right exactly problem with Diablo 3 beam online only I mean when the

356
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:23,800
servers weren't working but there's so how long did that last how long did that last people give

357
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:29,800
we forgave and forget we forgave I forgot the the auction house controversy and maybe I'm part

358
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:37,240
of the problem I love Diablo 3 now I love it now this is just online passes all over again because

359
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:42,040
they're gonna make the excuse that we need extra money to run our games up you know what you make

360
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:46,480
tons of money because you're not paying your fucking employees enough you're not paying you

361
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:51,920
know the royalties to people that like they would get in other industries so stop fucking complain

362
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:57,880
mm-hmm and to be fair to blizzard I think and I think this is important to say ask somebody who

363
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:01,760
is a blizzard fan and plays a lot of blizzard games I think part of the reason they get away

364
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:08,600
with like overwatch is always online and there's really nothing you can do about it is because they

365
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:15,520
make fucking quality aims like blizzard doesn't really make bad games at least not my opinion I

366
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:20,200
mean they misfired with Diablo 3 but they did what they had to do to fix it you know what I mean like

367
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:24,760
that's that's how blizzard gets away with it so just you know to be clear blizzard gets away with

368
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:29,840
it because they make fucking rock-solid games everybody wants to play so anyway is there

369
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:34,040
anything else on loot box I thought we have one other little tidbit no that was it oh is it okay

370
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:42,240
well there you go so yeah loot boxes in games there you go I think we will move on into our

371
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:48,480
gaming weeks but first a little I'll do housekeeping first real fast we are not going to be here and

372
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,040
actually my co-hosts are gonna hear this for the first time but I've been saying this for a couple

373
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:56,040
weeks that we probably won't be here Veterans Day weekend we're definitely not gonna be here

374
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:59,600
Veterans Day weekend because I am definitely going to be out of town so Alan and I decided

375
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:07,080
we're gonna go Seattle cuz we want to it like Southwest had a big sale so we got tickets like

376
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:12,400
80 bucks to Seattle so why not that's pretty good right it's a pretty good price right we were

377
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:16,040
looking at some other places but it was still a lot of money for Chicago and I think we're looking

378
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:20,360
at Vegas and but Seattle was like dirt cheap so we're like let's do it we we went to Seattle for

379
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:23,760
our five-year anniversary we had a great time so and I know a couple people up there so we'll go

380
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,560
back and do some of the stuff we didn't do the first time so there you go so for that reason we

381
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:33,880
will not be having a show Veterans Day weekend and that is November 13th I think cuz veterans

382
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:38,680
do we live why oh no we fly back on the 13th November 12th is the date of the show so no show

383
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:42,960
that day all right we're gonna move in to our gaming weeks and talking about the types of games

384
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,920
we have been playing this week dark soccer stepped out for just a moment so I'll go ahead and start

385
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:51,240
with Loki and how was your gaming week I didn't play too much unfortunately because I had planned

386
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:58,240
to play a bunch of things but I once again am still stuck with being obsessed with Legos and

387
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,520
not necessarily building Legos I've been actually doing stuff when one of the why started with a

388
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:09,240
Lego digital designer and then I moved on to this other program called stud I O which allows you to

389
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:13,480
manipulate things a little bit better than the Lego digital designer because they don't let you

390
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:18,080
just drop bricks in there in certain ways so I was been messing with that but I did play some games

391
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:23,440
I picked up because I've been checking like we have a target near or by and so they always have

392
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,560
stuff in clearance like the other day I didn't pick it up because I already have enough instruments

393
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:34,640
at home they had Guitar Hero the new one with a guitar it's like 20 bucks oh shoot yeah we're

394
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:40,120
at Target like yeah the Rancho shit I might go buy that it wasn't there last time I went there

395
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:46,080
last but last time I went there they had well one of the games I did pick up this week so I haven't

396
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:50,640
played it yet but I've been getting more VR games so I picked up they had a couple things digitally

397
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:56,880
on sale so I got the PlayStation worlds game because that was selling to like 10 bucks and

398
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:06,440
then I also picked up oh god what was the other one there's another VR game that drive club VR

399
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:10,720
because I think that was also down like 10 bucks so I picked those up and digitally and then Eagle

400
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:17,880
flight which is that weird Ubisoft game they had it for $12 so I picked that up as well because it

401
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:24,080
looks fun so they had that I was mainly looking for because they're closing at one time the Lego

402
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:28,360
dimension stuff and I wanted to get some of those sets cuz they're down like five I still need to

403
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:32,880
get that Midway set before it disappears I really want yeah it's gonna be hard to find I mean I saw

404
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:39,160
it in a store not that long ago I did see the Toys R Us and they had him at the Targon sunrise

405
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:44,480
if I remember correctly okay I because I look at that stuff every time I go in how can you not

406
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,120
well yeah cuz I'm like because they've been marking them down like occasionally I'll see

407
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:54,320
deals it like $1 I'm like oh damn I want that so there's like a routine so you know our pal

408
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,760
Shane my pal Shane that I hang out with all the time who hosts a show here on the network

409
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:02,480
called Ranger pride they're on a little hiatus right now but they'll be back Shane likes to go

410
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,120
and if you listen to Ranger pride you know he likes to go looking for all the toys right so

411
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:10,440
sometimes he'll con me into going on a toy hunt because it'll be like well let's just go on a toy

412
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:13,440
hunt that will do lunch or something like that and so you know we'll have ourselves a fun Saturday

413
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:18,040
morning so we have a routine like we go to Toys R Us and we look for the Power Ranger thing he's

414
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:23,560
looking for and then we always go we look at amiibos we look at video games like we just have a like

415
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:28,600
a habit of all the sections in the store any stuff mark down I almost picked up they had some of the

416
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:33,320
Finding Dory stuff there and I was like man my kids would really like that but we have too many

417
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:37,040
of those figures they don't play the game and my wife would be pissed if I pick more these up so

418
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:41,880
I'm like yeah I'm just gonna not yeah they don't play it you send them to Bobby Blackwell if he

419
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:46,760
plays but I knew they had a Doris if I hadn't seen it in any of the stores and now they have it there

420
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:53,680
you go yeah go ahead and pick it up anything else for your gaming week um just the usual clicker

421
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:58,280
game although I'm starting to get very tired of it so I don't know how long we continue with that

422
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:05,920
I mean I Pokemon go maybe a thing they'll be start up again for a little bit but yeah I'm just like

423
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:10,320
it's gotten to be more of like a chore and it's just there's like no point to it anymore I just

424
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:16,480
kind of yeah why am I wasting my time with this well I'll lead it to my gaming week that and say

425
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:22,080
I've been playing a little Pokemon go uh I don't I don't I don't view it as a chore like well I will

426
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:26,240
say this like you know the one thing I want to do in Pokemon go and I think you kind of have to

427
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:31,000
choose like what are your goals and Pokemon go do you want to raid gyms all the day and control

428
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:36,040
the gyms do you want you know to collect all the Pokemon and level them all up or what so I really

429
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:40,800
want to fill out the pokey decks right so right now in Pokemon go this month is where the anti

430
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:47,320
raids are happening which one of the legendaries but like it is like the raiding activity has died

431
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:54,480
off significantly from when it was the legendary birds and from when it was Raikou last month now

432
00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:00,520
I'm not saying Pokemon go is dead but Pokemon go is certainly not what it was over the summer or

433
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:06,800
even just taking a nap it's it's yeah siesta a little siesta I'd say it's probably like dropping

434
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:13,960
off faster as it goes long instead of it kind of taking a while to kind of dip it's going a lot

435
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:18,640
faster so I was legit worried like I was not gonna find a group to get an Entei and I have a little

436
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:22,800
chat we use a chat program called group me for some of the local people here and so usually when

437
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:28,840
raids happen and last month like raids every day every night this month once in a while but like

438
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:33,080
they don't happen every day so and I'm not available every day so I have to be careful

439
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:39,160
sometimes so we tried to go do something a couple nights ago I didn't get Entei on the first go but

440
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:44,640
today we went to a local park over here that has two gyms and by coincidence they both had Entei

441
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:49,880
at the same time and so we got to do two Entei raids back-to-back and I did catch an Entei at

442
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:54,480
one of those raids so and it was like this big sigh of relief like whew I'm not gonna miss it

443
00:39:54,480 --> 00:40:00,280
because I was so next month my lesson is learned I need to be out there day one which is what that's

444
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:06,440
gonna be like Halloween to go out and get the ice dog or I can't remember the name as something

445
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:10,200
but the ice dog I have to go up make sure I go out get day one because that's gonna be the easiest

446
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:15,600
day to do it so I was get a little worried but you know I still Pokemon go is still a good way

447
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:22,160
to gamify my walks like Fitbit kind of gamifies a lot with walking Pokemon go kind of does that

448
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:27,160
because it's like oh I can hatch eggs and I still you know I could still make some good Dragonite

449
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:32,560
you know use candy for things there's things and eggs you get a lot of stardust from that so it's

450
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:37,680
kind of like you know I'm not like obsessed with Pokemon go but it's a nice little distraction and

451
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:43,240
incentivizer for me to make sure I get up on my lunch and actually walk outside the building as

452
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:47,840
opposed to sit and play on the internet the entire lunch in my office and then whoops lunch is over

453
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:51,880
and I got to get back to work you know it's a nice way to make sure like I get out and get moving so

454
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:58,800
yeah so I have some I have been playing a little bit of Pokemon go guys you know in chat over at

455
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:04,560
live.vog network.com says it's in trouble because players know the Russians used it to hack our

456
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:11,720
election I how would they've used it to hack our election I don't remember what the story was but

457
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:19,440
I think it was something about people naming their Pokemon to certain controversial terms and putting

458
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:24,640
them in gyms and then taking pictures of it and spreading it on Facebook but I don't want to get

459
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:29,520
heavy into politics but the reality is it ain't just Pokemon go they were messing with to try to

460
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:34,860
influence the election we'll leave it at that I think I think that almost speaks to I know I

461
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:40,960
based my election choices but on the names of Pokemon and gyms I I think that just speaks

462
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:47,840
volumes about what a cultural phenomenon Pokemon go even was I mean think about it how many video

463
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:55,360
games since Polybus have you heard about a government conspiracy to change our way of life

464
00:41:55,360 --> 00:42:02,880
like it's been a while so anyway yeah that's what it was thank you Bobby Bobby's kind of echoing

465
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,200
what I'm saying they didn't hack the app itself but it was an ad campaign with people naming their

466
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:12,520
pokemons anyway other comments on Pokemon go and chat SSG100Matt says we had 30 people rating for

467
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:16,480
an Entei at a random mall in Connecticut we were shocked because this mall was in the middle of

468
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:21,000
nowhere okay so maybe my 30 people in Connecticut that's not bad so maybe my experience is

469
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:27,040
different let's hit Bobby Black Wolf jokes about Pokemon go it fainted and it will never wake back

470
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:34,680
up ever it didn't faint it might be down to like five hit points been faint other games I've been

471
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:40,240
playing besides Pokemon go so I did a live stream of cuphead after the show last week and that was

472
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:47,280
a lot of fun like it is it is a I love the art style the music the way the game feels like it's

473
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:52,600
a solid platformer like I Jamie if you and Dan checked out Cuphead cuz I really feel like you

474
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:56,600
guys haven't had a chance yet okay yeah I definitely at some point check it out I mean it's

475
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:02,320
it's infuriatingly hard but like just I think you're gonna love like the art style of the

476
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:06,040
presentation following it for a long time oh yeah it's been chatting with the developers from time

477
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:10,880
to time on Twitter oh fun yeah yeah no um it's been on my list for a while it's just right now

478
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:16,640
I'm still working on the convention guide for derpy con so that's been taking my spare time there

479
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,520
you go I'll check on you with your full game a week in a minute let me let me finish up real quick

480
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:26,560
so also uh let's see dungeon buster says you did great at cuphead Rob yeah thank you I did I I beat

481
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:34,080
the tutorial so I got through that and I beat a few of the bosses on stream so um you know I I am

482
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:40,520
allowed to continue to do a video game podcast I suppose after that but all that crap I'm saying

483
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:44,880
that very tongue-in-cheek here's the funny thing about that you guys might get a kick out of this

484
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:50,160
so I decided because I felt like that was a really good stream because I actually had a generous

485
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:54,800
twitch person put like 86 viewers on me at one point so like I had quite a few people watching

486
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,720
at the end so I feel like all that energy and a lot of people watching made it a really fun stream

487
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:03,680
so I was like you know I don't do this with a lot of my streams I'm gonna put this one on YouTube so

488
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:07,120
if you want to see the archive of the stream you can see it either on my twitch or you can see it

489
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:12,440
on YouTube you know I waited 24 hours you have to do and then I put it up here's the hilarious part

490
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:17,640
so within two days my YouTube has like 10 views because I wrote a tweet about it and 10 people

491
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:24,640
clicked it and it gets flagged for copyright infringement by this company and I don't even

492
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:29,920
remember the name of it was something like EBC maker EBCD makers only that was like what is I

493
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,440
tried to google it I couldn't find anything I searched for tweets about it and there was only

494
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:39,160
one other guy going these guys flagged my video and I was about to go off on YouTube and this whole

495
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:45,680
cuz here here we go this whole thing where the people that make the videos just fucking get

496
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:49,360
screwed by these people that come in and have no right to do so but I was like all right before

497
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:54,440
you go off check what the rules on Cuphead are so I was doing my research and sure enough studio

498
00:44:54,440 --> 00:45:00,200
MDHR or whoever sorry if I messed up the acronym but the studio that made Cuphead has a page that

499
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:05,600
very specifically says yes stream the games put the games on YouTube make money off them we don't

500
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:11,480
care get it out there you know so I I filed an appeal I said oh hell no I filed an appeal I linked

501
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:17,800
to that YouTube and so forth I will give YouTube credit when I sent my appeal they re-enabled the

502
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:23,840
video right away and I think that's a change from what it was before so and it said the claimants

503
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:31,760
have 30 days to respond and after a day the claim disappeared I never got an email saying that oh

504
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:38,760
they accepted it or whatever but I fought the law and I won and it feels good early so far knock

505
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:44,040
on wood but so far it's completely the claim is completely disappeared from my account so yeah

506
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:48,680
take that I think if you counter then they the next step is they have to file an actual lawsuit

507
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:52,840
or something yeah they don't own it so like but it's like they're not going to who the hell is

508
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:57,920
this company and I'm like you know if the if the Cuphead studio had a page that said do not post

509
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:02,380
the videos and monetize them I would have said well I don't have I don't have monetization anyway

510
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:11,160
because my YouTube channel has 9960 views so I'm like just shy of 10,000 I had it at one point but

511
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:15,640
I got turned away or whatever when they when they put the 10,000 view because I don't I don't

512
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:19,640
honestly I don't use YouTube a lot I've really been trying to focus my efforts on Twitch but

513
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:24,800
when I was at Dragon Con and on the podcast track I took some of the advice I believe it or not even

514
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:28,680
though I didn't take all the advice like start a patreon to heart I took some of the advice like

515
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:32,920
get your stuff out there on as many porn for platforms as possible I took that stuff to heart

516
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:36,760
so I was like you know what I do need to be pushing more of my twitch stuff to YouTube so I

517
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:40,320
was trying to do that and it was just funny that like this first video gets flagged and I have to

518
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:45,560
fight it and all that stuff but the experience could have been worse I guess I'll leave it that

519
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:50,400
way but if the studio had a page that said don't do it then I would have said okay my bad and I

520
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:55,080
would have taken it down and just been like okay I won't do that again so but that was a lot of

521
00:46:55,080 --> 00:47:00,800
indie game studios don't give a shit yeah uh SSG100Matt in chat says yeah these BS video

522
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:05,000
flaggers I have a friend who does YouTube full-time and he has to deal with this nonsense he often

523
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:10,120
often has to request a manual review on these claims has anybody ever tried to like class

524
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:15,080
action lawsuit these third-party companies surely that happened at some point with the bigger

525
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:20,880
streamers I'm not gonna do that shit but people like sort of mark plier might be able to so it's

526
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:26,120
not not really but like you know there is that whole case against Alex Mauer right now which is

527
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:33,040
kind of wrapping up oh yeah thing so basically she had a certain chance to respond and she

528
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:37,840
responded late and so now they are filing a motion the strike and all this stuff so it's

529
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:42,640
almost over so when it does end up if if they do win it end up winning which they probably will

530
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:48,400
then that does open it up to the fact that she was filing false DMCAs and they could file a

531
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:53,800
class-action lawsuit against her for lost revenue because she did two hundreds that could be an

532
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:59,560
interesting precedent too so be it'll be interesting to see what happens yeah because I mean it seems

533
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:05,880
like anybody can file a claim and you don't have to be the copyright owner of it and you know it's

534
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:11,920
gonna just fuck everybody over and what you you mean you could even just say low oh yeah and then

535
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:19,240
you know you can some people do this they'll wait the 30 days that they have to appeal and so before

536
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:22,840
they used to not get any revenue for that I think now it goes into an escrow account or something

537
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:27,520
like that and then at the very last second they'll just say okay we're dropping our claim but that

538
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:31,720
was 30 days you weren't getting revenue and by that time you know who's gonna see your video

539
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:37,720
right so all right anyway um what else in my game away let me quickly say Final Fantasy 14 got a

540
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:41,920
patch on Tuesday so I hadn't played in like a month but that was enough to get me to check it

541
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:46,120
out again so I've been playing that a little bit and I'm gonna do a live stream tonight after the

542
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:51,320
show Stardew Valley on Nintendo switch I'm gonna play that for the first time I played it on PC

543
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:56,160
before but I honestly don't remember it at all it was like over a year ago and I played once and I

544
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:59,920
don't remember it at all so I'm gonna but my Twitter has been lighting up with people who

545
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:04,840
love Stardew Valley on the switch and I was like it's only 10 bucks because I already had leftover

546
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:10,520
credit on my accounts I was like you know what let's do it I'm gonna buy Stardew Valley on switch

547
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:14,320
so we're gonna play that after the show tonight so I think that's it for my game a week I've

558
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:28,960
me because I thought I would be but it's still going so it's it's taking maybe 90% of the time

559
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:33,760
it was so I have a little more time to do stuff but not a lot because just like my Skype is

560
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:41,040
constantly going crazy from that game but it's it's fun and I'm meeting new people so yeah anyway

561
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:45,400
that's it that's it for your gaming week that's it for all our gaming weeks I already talked about

562
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:50,800
housekeeping and by the way Jamie no show veterans day weekend I dropped that on us for the first

563
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:56,520
time Alan and I are going to Seattle have fun yeah thank you we will we I earned it dammit this

564
00:50:56,520 --> 00:51:02,680
has been a shit year I I am ready to fucking go to Seattle and have fun all right let's get to some

565
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:09,280
gaming news Loki start us off would you yes so Nintendo is looking to get more adult games on

566
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:16,240
the switch so that's kind of a change because you know before they used to kind of not put those

567
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:20,080
types of games on there because the system is more of a family-friendly system but they seem

568
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:26,600
to be kind of moving in the adult theme area as well so for example you know they're saying that

569
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:33,080
games like doom you know Knights of Azure to brighter the new moon shinobi rifle centering

570
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:38,320
kangaroo coming to switch of course is a little bit of a change because those are definitely more

571
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:47,320
an adult-oriented game they're saying that you know I guess the creator of Galvin 2 actually was

572
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:51,840
surprised by Nintendo's reaction to their pitch of releasing that game on their platform he said I

573
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:56,360
thought it wouldn't be possible to release such a game for the switch but surprisingly Nintendo gave

574
00:51:56,360 --> 00:52:02,800
me positive feedback so it seems like they're a little bit more open to those types of games on

575
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:08,840
there which is good because I mean honestly you have to catering to children's fine because

576
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:14,080
there's plenty games to do that but you got to cater to as many people as possible so why not

577
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:18,720
I mean I think already they're kind of taking steps in the right direction especially with this

578
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:22,720
you know cross play and stuff all they need to do now is just get rid of those fucking friend codes

579
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:29,800
and then you'll be on board I mean but it seems to move it in the right direction so more blood

580
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:36,240
and more guts on the switch titties more titties on the switchy how about how about how about some

581
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:44,120
dongs to make it fair all right sure thank you Loki I appreciate the blessing with that HD rumble

582
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:52,160
you know you feel the dong in your hand there's a dick in my hand I don't think they vibrate unless

583
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:59,320
you have like additives no accessory oh oh I see I see well you know there's a lot of it it's not

584
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:04,240
supposed to vibrate it's like you know how they have the whole like you know ice cubes in the

585
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:09,280
controller demo type of thing so you won't really vibrate it but like you would you shake the

586
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:13,200
controller back and forth and you'd feel the weights of it flopping about you know flopping

587
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:22,760
all right anyway well what we'll see maybe more adult games coming switch what about night trap

588
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:26,840
because they've been re-released not everywhere night trap gonna come out on hot garbage so I

589
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:31,280
don't know if we need that game I just feel like whatever it's adult games always comes back to

590
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:38,280
night trap like the the og adult game what was that what was that game that was at e3 a decade

591
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:45,680
ago feel three or feel three that's it feel three for the we offer the switch why not put like five

592
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:49,200
nights at Freddy's I'm surprised that isn't on there already I'm kind of surprised too maybe

593
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:53,840
it's maybe it's not as easy as you'd think too because he made it in some type of game maker

594
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:59,520
program so maybe it's not as easy to port it over to the switch hmm but maybe it's inevitable at

595
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:02,800
some point I also got a feel five nights at Freddy's might be a little bit past its prime

596
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:09,800
probably but then again I mean fucking just in the past couple weeks we've had axiom verge and

597
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:16,160
stardew valley and these games that have come out on plenty of other consoles even years ago and I

598
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:20,440
feel like there's a lot of Nintendo fans that are kind of living these things for the first time

599
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:25,320
well I mean you like I think with the Wii U was and they didn't really focus too much on Indies

600
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:31,200
but like any scene that be able to have more visibility because there wasn't so much on the

601
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:35,440
platform and I think that's kind of the same scenario with switches there's not a ton of

602
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:40,400
things on the platform right now so you can get that visibility for your game and actually if

603
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:46,360
there's you know those games coming out few and far between you definitely have more people looking

604
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:51,800
at your game no that's a very good point I think Nintendo's really leveraged their e-shop a lot

605
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:57,200
better this time and you can't say there aren't a lot of games on the switch right now I mean

606
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:03,280
granted they're not a lot of triple-a titles but there's a lot of you know you can download

607
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:09,000
digitally except not all the same time because your switch only has 32 gigs of storage that was

608
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:15,640
really technically you can expand it technically didn't have to technically all right I shouldn't

609
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:20,520
have to do that all right let's talk about Microsoft a little bit Microsoft you know the

610
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:25,000
Kinect has kind of had one foot out the door for a little while now and you may not have realized

611
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:31,440
but when the Xbox one s launched last year which is the smaller Xbox one which is the only Xbox

612
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:36,200
one regular there's gonna be now there used to be a little adapter that you could get with it for

613
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:41,480
free that would allow the Kinect to be used on this console it's basically a USB to connect

614
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:47,600
adapter okay but that promotion you may not realize that ended in March this year so you

615
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:53,000
can no longer get that adapter for free all those connect games are not gonna be able to play well

616
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:59,320
just to be clear and the reason why I bring this up Xbox one X will not have a similar offer and

617
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:04,320
that was confirmed by Aaron Greenberg executive for Xbox on a Twitter I can't believe we're

618
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:09,520
confirming news via Twitter but here we are in 2017 Aaron Greenberg on Twitter said we provided

619
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:14,040
free adapters for a good part of last year following the Xbox one s launch but that program

620
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:21,920
has ended so well I don't think they're selling the Kinect anymore well to be fair is it completely

621
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:25,520
discontinued it's probably harder to find you probably don't get a lot of shelter things that

622
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:29,840
there but I bet you could probably go on Amazon and get one still right but a lot of it's gonna

623
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:35,120
be used yeah I don't think they're selling anymore cuz I can't honestly name you I would

624
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:42,040
assume just dance supports it but I think that is still assumption that's still an assumption

625
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:46,080
maybe just like that they support the move controller but I don't think you need the

626
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:51,840
move controller for anything right all phones but yeah I don't think there's not any games I can

627
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:56,520
think of they're coming out it's like man that's a Kinect game like even those well okay now I take

628
00:56:56,520 --> 00:57:02,160
that back there is a couple games do support it but those are those re-released Kinect adventure

629
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:06,600
games remember that they had like the Disney Adventure one that are coming out with controller

630
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:13,000
support now but they still support Kinect because it's you know like an HD remaster okay that's like

631
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:19,240
a very who gives a shit no one's looking for that I do want to point out Rama and chat says Microsoft

632
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:25,400
is still selling the Kinect Brad actually provides the link to Amazon so there you go those yeah they

633
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:30,520
I'm sure they got inventory that they want to move not an inventory you see in stores though so even

634
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:35,840
though we're not gonna bury the Kinect yet the Kinect is certainly it's you know with the Xbox

635
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:43,360
1x they're not focusing on Kinect the message is 4k fucking beautiful gaming that's the message on

636
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:50,080
Xbox one X that is not Kinect anymore so you know they're gonna keep pushing the beautifulness of

637
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:56,400
games like four is a seven and crackdown three when it comes out next year and the other stuff

638
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:01,320
that has the Xbox one I've already forgotten about crackdown three whoops yeah so I'd be

639
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:05,560
curious to see how that little console does this holiday for Microsoft's gonna be very very

640
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:11,200
interesting I think it do well I would assume either I just kind of worry that this well I

641
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:16,520
don't know like definitely the Xbox one X has its audience I don't think it's gonna move the number

642
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:23,240
of units that the switch does this holiday but does it need to maybe not you know the Xbox one

643
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:28,360
X is a high-end piece of hardware I don't know how to move high-end types of numbers I'm sure

644
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:33,960
it where the targets it'll do better one there's more 4k content out there because I think right

645
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:38,480
now it's still very early it's kind of like where 3d TVs were for a while where they're really

646
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:43,640
pushing that it was almost too early I mean the 4k TVs have been out for a while now it's just like

647
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:49,120
is it necessary like do you really feel like that you need to upgrade or anything I don't feel like

648
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:55,360
that yet I mean it would be a nice to have but it's not something I'm looking to go out and do

649
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:59,760
right away until my TV dies and then yeah I'll get 4k TV then that's kind of where I'm at and

650
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:05,840
remember I'd mentioned this after e3 it's like I'm excited to do 4k gaming on PC but even that

651
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:10,040
I think you know the money that I probably would have spent on a 4k graphics card I just bought a

652
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:17,040
vacation with so yeah that's probably gonna wait till 2018 or just take for guys okay oh don't do

653
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:22,400
4k do like 1440p or something like that and just drop it down a little bit and then you have like

654
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:26,680
killer frame rate to go with it oh yeah enhanced everything that's kind of yeah like even or I can

655
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:31,080
play like 2k still runs pretty decent on the car to yeah so that's probably what I'll end up doing

656
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:38,800
so yeah and I can still do 4k movies and all that stuff just fine that I don't runs great on my my

657
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:43,240
rig so you know I still I saw all that but yeah I'm probably just gonna wait a little bit on the

658
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:50,800
gaming portion of that but um I I will say this the Xbox has now become my living room console

659
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:56,840
because my PlayStation 4 got moved into the office so I could do more streaming with it I still play

660
00:59:56,840 --> 01:00:04,200
games on PlayStation 4 but I do my Hulu and CBS for Star Trek and all this I do all that on Xbox

661
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:08,440
now I don't do it on PlayStation so just kind of an interesting shift I've been kind of having to

662
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:12,360
use my Xbox more for that media stuff so I can watch on the TV in the living room and the

663
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:18,360
experience has been fine so you know it's pretty easy to grab new apps and I do like I will give

664
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:25,760
it is much easier if I were to say download episodes of RuPaul's Drag Race which I would

665
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:30,640
never do but let's say I did like it's very easy to put them on a USB Drive and then plug that into

666
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:35,520
my Xbox one and just play them right off that so which doesn't really work as easy on PlayStation

667
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:40,600
4 it's too bad I mean I get why they do it but it's too bad that they don't like partner like

668
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:48,680
and this is not even necessarily any you know specific console but one thing I love on my

669
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:55,920
Android TV box is the whole Google cast stuff because they have apps that they build specifically

670
01:00:55,920 --> 01:01:01,480
for that and I love the native apps but half of the native apps aren't available you just have to

671
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:09,680
cast over to it but it works fantastic so I'm a little too well actually because my kids tablets

672
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:16,000
it somehow knows that my TV things on our network and if they hit the button it casts to the TV and

673
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:20,840
there's no way to block that so it's like you'll be watching TV also and some shitty YouTube

674
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:29,560
children's things on there my god fucking damn it yeah turn that shit off anyway going to something

675
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:38,240
else about Xbox and Microsoft to remember the original og Xbox the Xbox first Xbox VCR Xbox

676
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:42,880
Uno those games are still gonna be backwards compatible at some point remember crimson skies

677
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:48,720
hello anyway it is still coming Xbox head Phil Spencer reaffirmed in an interview with game

678
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:54,040
spot it is happening saying we're close we're really close we're so close keep going anyway

679
01:01:54,040 --> 01:02:01,320
it should gene we should watch by the end of the year so by the end of the year you should be able

680
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:07,600
to play things like crimson skies and fusion frenzy on your Xbox they're just using frenzy

681
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:15,480
just blow a big bunch of games all over you all at once you know what props to them for actually

682
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:20,440
working on backwards compatibility yeah it's like had I known this now when I was shopping for

683
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:26,920
consoles I probably have an Xbox one instead of a PlayStation 4 hmm and it's just disappointing to

684
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:32,280
see how little movement there is on that front with PlayStation it's just they want me to do

685
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:36,720
their streaming service and no I don't want to do your streaming service Sony's getting a little

686
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:40,400
cocky and it might you know it's gonna be interesting are we gonna go in the next in the

687
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:45,320
next gym are we gonna flip back again it's gonna be well the reason why I'm saying Sony's getting

688
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:49,440
cocky just people understand this whole of cross-platform gaming again I don't think it made

689
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:53,600
our show tonight but there was another game out there I was reading a story about that they came

690
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:59,880
out said well we'll be cross-platform on switch Xbox one and PC because Sony won't let us do it

691
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:07,480
and I just Sony can only sit on top of that throne so long you know it's it's people remember that

692
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:13,400
kind of crap mm-hmm mm-hmm all right let's let's hope they correct make a corrective course soon

693
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:17,040
anyway let's move on we've been talking a lot of the first two stories so let's go over to Dark

694
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:23,840
Sakura with what she has to report oh well I don't know if it's gonna be bad or good it could be

695
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:33,440
good it could be like I said bad but humble bundle has been acquired by IGN as in you know

696
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:45,600
the the gaming news slash strategy stuff you know website but anyway they said though that they

697
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:52,840
chose IGN because they quote understand their vision that they think that they'll be able to

698
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:59,800
help hunt a humble bundle continue with their quest for charity and good works through gaming

699
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:12,240
so I hope I hope it stays good I hope hope hope they don't get screwed over in this so yay to

700
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:16,640
register participation for this week's episode of orange island radio at vog network calm use

701
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:25,720
the passphrase door as long as the charity support stays I think there will still be a lot of fans of

702
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:30,600
humble bundle and I think you know again one thing that's gonna have to stay and I don't know how IGN

703
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:37,320
feels about this but the ability to choose you know if you're gonna give money to charity or

704
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:42,240
give money to developers or give money as a tip to the humble bundle itself to keep it going I

705
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:46,720
know the default is usually like a third a third a third but you know if you want you can slide the

706
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:52,040
bar and you just give all the money to charity and you know some people some people play with that

707
01:04:52,040 --> 01:05:00,520
maybe they'll give you know 40% to charity 40% to the developers and 20% to humble bundle you know

708
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:05,000
sometimes people like to play with those numbers so I think as long as that stays there people

709
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:11,440
won't get upset but like if the tip becomes required or something like that then that's

710
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:16,360
where people are gonna start to abandon that chip real quick my only thing with humble bundle is

711
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:21,080
that there's so many of them now so frequently that it's hard to keep tabs when good ones are

712
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:26,440
out I wish it integrated more with steam so I could see which games I already own because there's

713
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:31,800
like several humble bundles where like I just don't buy them because I have like half the games on

714
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:37,200
them I mean it's nice to support charities and stuff but I don't need to buy stuff I already have

715
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:42,680
act-deft in chat says I'm not really okay with IGN buying humble but at the same time I do

716
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:47,680
think IGN can help them become bigger s2100 Matt says as long as IGN lets humble continue to do

717
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:53,280
their thing I am okay but I'm extremely cautious about this stop he says I'm sure it was it's

718
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:57,160
gonna change does anyone to remember the stories from a year or so ago when they were saying they

719
01:05:57,160 --> 01:06:02,760
couldn't afford to pay humble staff Bobby Blackwell says humble bundles lost their uniqueness they

720
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:07,840
were better when they were just an event now it's just yet another digital storefront and that's

721
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:13,440
boring you know what I hate to fucking bring this up but I'm gonna I'm gonna fucking bring it up

722
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:19,280
it's exactly what's gonna happen to she's one sauce in the winner it's exactly what's gonna

723
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:23,560
happen everybody's losing their fucking mind they're gonna try they're like wow that's not

724
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:27,600
really good this stuff was nasty anyway and then when it comes out and it's it because now

725
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:31,400
McDonald's fucking because of everything's happened they've come back to new a corner

726
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:36,120
fucking publicity got the factory going overtime right now so that come November December they're

727
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:39,480
gonna have that shit everywhere and then people are gonna try it they're gonna be like no wonder

728
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:47,480
they got rid of this shit the first time it's like Crystal Pepsi kinda why can't they bring

729
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:52,280
back Josta if they're gonna bring back something surge bring back surge I know they sell it on

730
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:57,160
Amazon but why can't it be in store I bet you surge sucks too you know what is seriously

731
01:06:57,400 --> 01:07:02,600
delicious search was fucking awesome but they changed the recipe so it's not quite the same

732
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:09,200
anymore but I still want I I have found I gotta work something from Amazon recent pretty soon so

733
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:13,040
I'm gonna get surge with that I have found something that tastes like Josta by the way

734
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:17,640
and they sell it at the Russian grocery store out in Citrus Heights it's like some guarana drink but

735
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:24,520
it tastes just like Josta just saying noted that's just like I know I saw catch-up still was my stuff

736
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:28,680
okay I saw ketchup chips for sale the other day ketchup is disgusting I had a very Canadian

737
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:38,880
moment no why not I did order mushroom ketchup really you put it's an 18th century thing you

738
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:47,080
put ketchup on your french fries mayonnaise french fries are a potato fuck that french fries you put

739
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:50,320
ketchup on french fries or not your cheese why can't you put ketchup on potato chips it's they're

740
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:55,680
both potatoes ketchup is disgusting ketchup is fine I almost feel about ketchup the way you do

741
01:07:55,680 --> 01:08:01,360
about mayonnaise potato chips in that case fine don't eat them but see you don't really put ketchup

742
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:06,680
on potato chips I'm fine if you want to dip that shit you know that's fine or even the ranch or

743
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:11,840
something that'd be fine but like I don't know if you should put on the chips or make your chips

744
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:17,640
clearly with people's fucking obsession with ranch I don't know I think ranch is nasty in

745
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:23,240
most scenario it's all about balsamic vinegar I knew a guy in college that bought ranch by the

746
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:30,160
gallon and he would have the gallon fucking mug in the the refrigerator and would put it on

747
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:41,920
everything when you dip it in the ranch like the internet like a soda Alan is here to lend us some

748
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:47,320
witful insight now that he heard this the worst application of ranch dressing I've ever seen in

749
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:52,720
my life was back in 95 96 senior year of high school when the cafeteria had the big Costco

750
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:58,480
pumps of ketchup mustard and ranch and people would drizzle ranch on like they're like this

751
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:04,680
shitty cardboard flat pizza that was like it was like it basically wasn't even cheese it was like

752
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:08,960
it was like it was like the frosting top of a zinger doing Twinkie or just peeled it off so

753
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:16,520
that so they would put ranch on that but the worst were the girls who got a Nissan cup of ramen put

754
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:23,920
in the hot water and then put in four pumps of ranch so water down ranch in their cup of noodles

755
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:33,120
that happened that's a travesty that happened 20 years ago 22 years ago and a tragedy so worse

756
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:37,880
I've never looked at ranch the same way again I do like Hidden Valley Ranch you know if we're

757
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:43,520
gonna get brand specific because oh no no more ranch discussion sorry Ken's brand is the best

758
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:50,400
cool ranch and it's on a Dorito I want nothing Doritos are fucking gross all right and you can

759
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:56,400
use them as fire kindling it's your story all right no Alan was just borrowing my mic for a

760
01:09:56,400 --> 01:10:00,480
minute artitsu we only have three in studio right now seriously yes Szechuan sauce is gonna be a

761
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:05,360
fucking joke and I don't know why people were flipping did you hear someone traded one of those

762
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:10,480
packets for a car I apologize for the listener to the listeners for bringing up Szechuan sauce

763
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:15,200
on olr I was trying to make a point and look what fucking happened I will learn my lesson

764
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:22,240
for next time and do better oh we go on tangents like that's this is the first time that's ever

765
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:31,160
happened our 10 into the show Loki next story so you know as I mentioned I may be getting back

766
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:39,080
into Pokemon soon that's because the new update has been data mined and we've found pictures for

767
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:45,160
the Halloween event that's right there's gonna be some Halloween event which is not unexpected but

768
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:53,400
along with that there's also trophy listings and badges for the third gen of Pokemon so third gen

769
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:59,120
of Pokemon I'm probably gonna be here within two weeks or so it could be a limited start

770
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:05,200
remember when Gen 2 released it was just the babies for the first yeah I don't think it's

771
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:12,000
but I'm just saying don't be shocked if it's the ghost Pokemon only I do need some more

772
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:16,280
ghost Pokemon though I'm pretty deficient in the ghost Pokemon area I don't think there's any like

773
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:21,560
big heavy-hitting ghost Pokemon right now like maybe Gengar but you have to really power it up

774
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:29,360
you know yeah so but yeah they're saying though there's a new loading screen and it has I guess

775
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:34,400
teasing third generation Pokemon as well so they've got that's the most damning and yet

776
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:43,920
dustclops, shuppet, bannet, dust skull and sableye so and then of course Gengar is on there but those

777
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:49,200
might be the only Pokemon I'm just warning because I seem to remember when Gen 2 launched we got a

778
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:55,800
loading screen with Pichu and Igglybuff and the babies that they let out originally so I'm just

779
01:11:55,800 --> 01:12:01,480
saying be prepared y'all that those may be the only Gen 3 Pokemon we get at first and then by

780
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:05,920
December or whatever or no probably earlier than that by November Thanksgiving or something we'll

781
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:10,560
have all the rest of Gen 3 but I'm glad we didn't have to wait an entire year it was only about eight

782
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:15,040
months well can we fast forward to Alola already well that's what I'm saying it's like I think that

783
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:20,880
the lull is going it's it's not dragging out as long anymore it's like people are kind of getting

784
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:25,840
over it really fast and so they're gonna have to get those updates a lot faster yeah well I would

785
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:30,440
say Niantic is still it's raining money over there because I'm sure with the raids you know there's

786
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:35,120
still enough people doing them that they're making money you know right it's not kid ourselves but

787
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:41,520
isn't it nice to make a lot of money and we still have Mewtwo raids to really I mean I know they've

788
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:46,600
done a couple but they didn't really launch them big so I mean I still don't have Mewtwo which

789
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:50,760
actually I'm kind of pressed about that because a lot of people I know do have them so I kind of

790
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:55,560
like that to come back so I can try to catch another so we'll see though maybe that's something

791
01:12:55,560 --> 01:13:02,160
it's gonna launch around gen 3 I don't know so as 100 Matt thinks in our chat I think there will

792
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:06,880
be more costumed Pokemon they did come out with this update about not being able to transfer

793
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:12,880
costume Pokemon without an extra screen I thought that was always because we had that bug a month or

794
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:19,320
two ago where the Pikachu's weren't showing their hats right yeah and so people like may accidentally

795
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:23,800
throw them away but now you can't do that so that's great I'm so happy they put that in actually

796
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:28,160
and then one other thing that they're doing also a little bit before this whole update that's

797
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:33,320
allegedly this was happen this is Pokemon go photography contest so using the app you can

798
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:38,720
actually take pictures of course of Pokemon and with the AR camera so they're basically having

799
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:46,080
you kind of try to get the best spot or shot that you can and then share it on Instagram and tag it

800
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:51,760
Pokemon go contest so you have until the 25th of October to do that and I guess they haven't really

801
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:57,160
announced with the prize oh here we go so if you do win and this is used US residents only

802
01:13:57,160 --> 01:14:02,360
unfortunately the winner gets a bag containing a poster autographed by the team a pair of wireless

803
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:11,800
Bluetooth earbuds and go plus so it's kind of alright can I submit old photos because I have

804
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:18,280
a picture of a Paris on the grill at Benihana that I still think is funny probably I mean that

805
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:23,840
would be fun and fine I might try that definitely don't do anything you would see in the Pokemon go

806
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:33,200
our Pokemon go gone wild community oh god that is unfortunately a thing oh god is it a tumbler

807
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:39,880
it's a reddit subreddit I'm sure it's a tumbler thing as well but yes if you want to see you know

827
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:18,560
to fort all night over on a gadget they had a story that caught my eye is talking about a

828
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:22,480
fortnight lawsuit because I know a lot of people are playing the fortnight battle royale online

829
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:27,560
well apparently epic games has filed a civil lawsuit against two people they say are cheating

830
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:33,520
while playing online and they're doing it through a website called addicted cheats which apparently

831
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:39,280
this website it's subscription based and you can on this website use their services to hunt down

832
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:47,480
and kill twitch streamers while they played live what a bunch of dicks what a dick bag thing to do

833
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:51,320
yeah people like doing it but that's usually they know it's usually they have a delay on it

834
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:55,720
and a lot of twitch streamers can put like a 30-second delay so it doesn't matter interesting

835
01:17:55,720 --> 01:18:04,200
but so anyway I what epic games excuse you have a cease pardon me blessing I'm allergic to bullshit

836
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:10,800
are rated stuff with epic game says in the suit that individuals had to dive in and modify

837
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:16,900
fortnight's source code and able to do this and this violates the EU LA and the DMCA that of

838
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:22,500
course being the License Agreement and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act so anyway epic is not

839
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:27,820
suing the site to get it off the internet it's suing the two individuals for copyright infringement

840
01:18:27,820 --> 01:18:34,020
that can carry a penalty up to a hundred and fifty thousand dollars these two defendants are

841
01:18:34,020 --> 01:18:39,900
technical support for addicted cheats calm so it looks like epic games may be trying to make an

842
01:18:39,900 --> 01:18:46,140
example out of them in the complaint one defendant was banned from fortnight nine times continue to

843
01:18:46,140 --> 01:18:51,700
make new accounts to continue playing accused of using specifically the addicted cheat site to hunt

844
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:57,620
down popular players while live streaming which I guess is a whole prat is a whole part of the dark

845
01:18:57,620 --> 01:19:04,580
web no dark web thing they just do that the dark web yeah called a stream sniping and that is

846
01:19:04,580 --> 01:19:08,580
forbidden in the code of contact for player unknowns battlegrounds which is why the guy

847
01:19:08,580 --> 01:19:15,700
got banned nine times so anyway that would be interesting also addicted cheats has taken that

848
01:19:15,740 --> 01:19:25,060
cheat offline saying it's closed for a legal issue there you go come on no Gus and chat says addicted

849
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:33,060
cheats is that like an Ashley Madison site something let's see stop Ian chat says how do

850
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:37,140
you even find individual streamers apparently this site would let you do it this site somehow

851
01:19:37,140 --> 01:19:42,060
goes to the code and and will put like in their game people would normally do is they'd have a

852
01:19:42,220 --> 01:19:46,700
stream on at the same time and they try to get in the same game as a streamer and they kind of

853
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:51,820
figure out based on where they see them right you know but then you have that's that's really easy

854
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:57,540
to do if you have like a short delay it's the whole look it's the whole rule of golden I you

855
01:19:57,540 --> 01:20:01,460
don't fucking look at my screen to figure out where I am you keep your eyes on a damn screen

856
01:20:01,460 --> 01:20:06,580
we're just like why waste your time doing that I mean I guess if you think if you're just trolling

857
01:20:06,580 --> 01:20:11,860
I guess you might be easily amused by that kind of stuff but that just seems dumb yeah in case you

858
01:20:11,860 --> 01:20:14,980
don't kind of brings up in chat saying can't someone just do that looking at someone's stream

859
01:20:14,980 --> 01:20:19,220
yes but you can't really force your way into their game and I'm assuming this website kind

860
01:20:19,220 --> 01:20:24,100
of facilitates you being able to make sure you get matched with them no I don't know I don't know

861
01:20:24,100 --> 01:20:28,460
what that would do I don't know what it does because I would not use such a site this would

862
01:20:28,460 --> 01:20:33,860
like show like say the usernames from like a longer distance away so they can see oh this is

863
01:20:33,860 --> 01:20:37,780
where this person is and they it's like a wall hack almost where you can see the person through

864
01:20:37,780 --> 01:20:42,620
the walls and so you can see where they are just goes make a beeline you know a lot about this

865
01:20:42,620 --> 01:20:50,180
Loki well I've been playing games for a long time I have to all right moving on speaking of she who

866
01:20:50,180 --> 01:20:55,180
has been playing games for a long time dark soccer we have for us I have some stuff about blizzard

867
01:20:55,180 --> 01:21:04,420
sue in the pants off people because it's not you know the the 2000 teens without having you know

868
01:21:04,460 --> 01:21:13,300
one company sue another and in this case blizzard is suing a and actually its partner oversees

869
01:21:13,300 --> 01:21:19,580
neaties I think it's called net ease are suing developers of a game called heroes of warfare

870
01:21:19,580 --> 01:21:28,660
the developers for three nine nine and they are they put out what they called the first MOBA on

871
01:21:29,540 --> 01:21:38,900
iOS or Android they have you know stylized characters with checkpoints on maps that's

872
01:21:38,900 --> 01:21:45,820
similar layouts like in overwatch and certain sound effects that sound like they've been pulled

873
01:21:45,820 --> 01:21:55,300
directly from overwatch as well as a very similar UI so yeah Blizzard's like I know you didn't and

874
01:21:55,300 --> 01:22:03,780
decided to lay the smack down financially on this Chinese company which I mean we get a lot

875
01:22:03,780 --> 01:22:12,740
of clones I think you know trying to make money off of successful IPs but in this case I was

876
01:22:12,740 --> 01:22:17,540
looking at some of the video of it it looks pretty pretty similar I mean the biggest difference is

877
01:22:17,540 --> 01:22:24,700
platform but I don't know it's cute I mean you still make me it's probably still make me sick

878
01:22:24,700 --> 01:22:29,780
you still can't put Super Mario Brothers on the iPhone unless you're Nintendo just because it's

879
01:22:29,780 --> 01:22:35,780
a change in platform right yeah that whole type of thing yeah so so so they're getting their their

880
01:22:35,780 --> 01:22:41,540
butt sued that's what you get come up with an original idea it'll be interesting to see how

881
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:47,140
it turns out because this practice is very common not just in China if you go on to you know

882
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:54,300
Apple Store or Google Play you're gonna find tons of clones of games Russian hackers gonna hack look

883
01:22:54,300 --> 01:22:59,660
look at look when flappy bird came out some dude made a game called flappy vog it was such a ripoff

884
01:22:59,660 --> 01:23:06,940
I'm just I'm teasing obviously I think a ton of people did and for one flappy vog speeds up as

885
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:12,740
you play which the original doesn't do so it does have a key difference but anyway all that stuff

886
01:23:12,740 --> 01:23:16,660
aside I mean there's all these types of you know ripoffs but there's a big difference probably

887
01:23:16,740 --> 01:23:22,620
between something like flappy bird and you know cuz again I'll you know kidding aside these other

888
01:23:22,620 --> 01:23:26,820
knockoffs usually don't have a bird it's flappy something else you know a flappy podcast hosts

889
01:23:26,820 --> 01:23:33,340
or whatever but you'd usually don't like copy art assets down to you know what's really

890
01:23:33,340 --> 01:23:38,500
indistinguishable from other games I don't know those pipes sure did look like super mario bros

891
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:44,940
pipes that's true that's true oh how funny I never knew this Bobby Blackwell and chat says fun fact

892
01:23:45,060 --> 01:23:51,580
I have never actually played flappy bird when I made flappy vog I just saw a video or two well I

893
01:23:51,580 --> 01:23:56,780
take comfort in knowing I have probably one of the last phones left they can still play flappy bird

894
01:23:56,780 --> 01:24:03,820
because I still not on iOS 11 you know what what never played flappy bird flappy bird happy bird

895
01:24:03,820 --> 01:24:12,900
yeah never played flappy bird there's probably a reddit for that to do another story Loki so

896
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:17,660
we talked a little bit about loot boxes earlier and that's kind of one way developers and

897
01:24:17,660 --> 01:24:23,460
publishers I think publishers are more involved with this piece out parts of games that would

898
01:24:23,460 --> 01:24:27,900
normally be included in the full price of the game well another practice to do that as well is

899
01:24:27,900 --> 01:24:36,940
pre-order bonuses that's right and so it's there was a specific online web advertisement from the

900
01:24:36,940 --> 01:24:45,060
wonderful folks at the evil G that were advertising the pre-order bonus for Assassin's Creed origins

901
01:24:45,060 --> 01:24:50,500
and so it kind of pissed off people a little bit because it basically showed this camel jump up in

902
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:56,060
the way it's like sorry the bonus mission is blocked unless you pre-order Assassin's Creed

903
01:24:56,060 --> 01:25:04,020
origins because you know it's sort of playing or making fun of the whole pre-order culture but

904
01:25:04,540 --> 01:25:09,740
being that this company is the one that kind of perpetuates that pre-order culture some people

905
01:25:09,740 --> 01:25:15,220
weren't so sensitive to or weren't as happy to see that in an advertisement blatantly just saying

906
01:25:15,220 --> 01:25:21,460
kind of like yeah we know what's wrong with fuck you guys pre-ordered this shit you know so that's

907
01:25:21,460 --> 01:25:26,380
the thing apparently though I've from what I've seen is they've kind of taken this ad offline so

908
01:25:26,380 --> 01:25:32,020
you can't really find it anymore but do you think there were some angry gamers around this probably

909
01:25:32,020 --> 01:25:40,500
people get angry over a lot of things but it is kind of angry people on my yes yes on your

910
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:47,580
internet it's more real than you think I just but yeah it is kind of shitty the block a mission

911
01:25:47,580 --> 01:25:52,340
behind a pre-ordered you know DLC thing that's why you wait for the game of the year edition

912
01:25:52,340 --> 01:25:58,860
you know mm-hmm late gamers all right well hopefully you won't have to wait too long to

913
01:25:58,940 --> 01:26:02,620
pick up this game because it's a blizzard game so you know they do good stuff as we were talking

914
01:26:02,620 --> 01:26:07,420
about earlier apparently it's a new overwatch game that they may be working on this is huge

915
01:26:07,420 --> 01:26:12,540
rumor and it's based off the fact that a vacancy on the blizzard jobs website says that they are

916
01:26:12,540 --> 01:26:18,780
looking to expand overwatch with a generalist artist intern with knowledge and understanding

917
01:26:18,780 --> 01:26:23,340
of overwatch to work on a unannounced project well shoot that could be anything because that

918
01:26:23,340 --> 01:26:28,340
could be like a mobile type of game or something you know certainly will make a lot of sense if

919
01:26:28,340 --> 01:26:35,260
blizzard wanted to use the overwatch IP on mobile somehow over watches the overwatch hmm let's see

920
01:26:35,260 --> 01:26:42,300
it's also brought up that a while ago last year over on neo gaff somebody had found a listing for

921
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:48,220
a lead software engineer for a first-person title and Mike Morehame has confirmed in the past there

922
01:26:48,220 --> 01:26:55,620
are teams working on new projects especially on mobile so it really could be anything I wouldn't

923
01:26:55,620 --> 01:27:02,540
mind seeing a new overwatch game in a couple years but I really like the stuff like Junkenstein's

924
01:27:02,540 --> 01:27:09,420
revenge and the PvE type of stuff especially when they did the uprising I think was an overwatch

925
01:27:09,420 --> 01:27:14,420
uprising I like those types of events and the Junkenstein event by the way you know I know

926
01:27:14,420 --> 01:27:18,420
we're joking about loot boxes but if you are an overwatch player don't forget to sign in and get

927
01:27:18,420 --> 01:27:21,940
your Halloween loot box and do the Junkenstein uprising because it's not that hard and you get

928
01:27:21,940 --> 01:27:25,860
a loot box from that too and in fact if you do it like nine times you can get like three more

929
01:27:25,860 --> 01:27:32,860
loot boxes you can get a lot so yeah get your loot boxes then you don't have to buy them for

930
01:27:32,860 --> 01:27:39,460
your cosmetic crap sure but yeah a new overwatch game I'd be into it but I see where blizzard

931
01:27:39,460 --> 01:27:43,980
maybe wouldn't want to cannibalize the overwatch they have now so it would have to be something

932
01:27:43,980 --> 01:27:48,180
maybe a little different but I think an overwatch PvE type of game would be awesome so we'll see

933
01:27:48,180 --> 01:27:58,620
all right well let's travel back to a simpler time we're gonna travel back to a time when there

934
01:27:58,620 --> 01:28:03,740
was no loot boxes there was just in fact if something was wrong with this cartridge like

935
01:28:03,740 --> 01:28:09,060
if the boss was just missing on level 30 too fucking bad you dealt with it you didn't have

936
01:28:09,060 --> 01:28:16,260
loot box you had a recall you had a hacked passwords yeah seriously so we're gonna terror

937
01:28:16,260 --> 01:28:23,420
horror danger exclamation point and Justin Bailey our classic game of the week the dark

938
01:28:23,420 --> 01:28:29,220
soccer is gonna step into the gaming vault find a game that she thinks hey you little brats give

939
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:33,020
me all the money you are gonna give the loot box people and go play this classic game instead

940
01:28:33,020 --> 01:28:38,580
because it has no loot boxes and you can still play this game for like 60 hours oh yeah this

941
01:28:38,580 --> 01:28:44,700
game is at least 60 hours of joy this is a great pick too it's one again here again how long have

942
01:28:44,700 --> 01:28:50,100
we been doing this segment like almost 500 classic and this is a game that I started and never spent

943
01:28:50,100 --> 01:28:55,500
much more time on I really really wish that I had and this is one of those games where I'm like how

944
01:28:55,500 --> 01:29:01,620
is how have we not done this before right now so anyway this is the classic game is Terranigma

945
01:29:01,620 --> 01:29:11,740
which in Japan was called a tenchi sozo which means the creation of heaven and earth it was

946
01:29:11,740 --> 01:29:21,900
released in 1995 by enix with character designs done by a mangaka named Fujiwara Kamui Kamui sorry

947
01:29:21,900 --> 01:29:31,660
it was released in English in the UK it was also released in German French and Spanish but never

948
01:29:31,660 --> 01:29:37,380
released in North America which is a fucking travesty because this game I mean even a little

949
01:29:37,380 --> 01:29:41,860
bit I played of it was really good you know it was just you know a little bit more of my own

950
01:29:41,860 --> 01:29:50,060
gamer a DD and no SSJ 100 mat Julian is never picking halo because I'm only the my words the

951
01:29:50,060 --> 01:29:57,660
final word the buck stops with me yeah then I kick it in the ass so basically the game has a

952
01:29:57,660 --> 01:30:03,660
top-down perspective over the world it is an action-based real-time battle system to where

953
01:30:03,660 --> 01:30:08,500
you do different techniques depending on with your if you're running jumping attacking or using

954
01:30:08,500 --> 01:30:17,020
a combination of the actions but each attack will have different ways it can hurt different

955
01:30:17,020 --> 01:30:23,940
enemies and so you get experience you know it increases your stats you get you know whatever

956
01:30:23,940 --> 01:30:31,260
dead enemies leave behind like oh look the squirrel left me a compound bow that's interesting

957
01:30:31,260 --> 01:30:37,780
where did the scroll keep the compound but you know bow up its ass compressed highly compressed

958
01:30:37,780 --> 01:30:45,700
you also have you know spells and then different things that boost spells and the series that you

959
01:30:45,700 --> 01:30:51,380
can click these things called magic rocks that you take them to a magic shop and have them

960
01:30:51,380 --> 01:30:57,380
transformed into rings and summons so kind of like early materia system too if you think about it

961
01:30:58,380 --> 01:31:04,500
but the thing that I always thought was cool about this game was the world it was built in is that

962
01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:12,340
you have a fictional earth that is a hollow sphere so you have the people that live on the surface

963
01:31:12,340 --> 01:31:19,900
and the people that live on the internal face of it so light side dark side and then two different

964
01:31:19,980 --> 01:31:29,300
forces that rule them on the top it's the ability to evolve and exceed and on the dark side it's

965
01:31:29,300 --> 01:31:35,780
decline so that creates two forces called God and devil which I guess people in America have

966
01:31:35,780 --> 01:31:41,380
their you know head so far if their asses over anything with vague religious symbolism so

967
01:31:41,380 --> 01:31:49,260
whatever the fuck and then like the last battle takes place in Antarctica so but it's it's a

968
01:31:49,260 --> 01:31:57,540
really really neat game it has really great music and of course it was done by annex just a really

969
01:31:57,540 --> 01:32:05,860
gorgeous game put out for the Super Famicom Super Nintendo and the company that that created it was

970
01:32:05,860 --> 01:32:14,340
quintet who I'm sorry the development company was quintet who also designed Actraiser and Soul

971
01:32:14,340 --> 01:32:23,660
Blazer you know illusion of Gaia an annex basically commissioned them a subcontractor and

972
01:32:23,660 --> 01:32:30,940
wanted an action role-play game so that's how it happened so basically the the founder of quintet

973
01:32:30,940 --> 01:32:38,940
wrote the script for the game and the scenarios had to be approved and it was just really a lot

974
01:32:38,940 --> 01:32:48,660
that went into it they they had a little bit of I'd say early CG in it you know for designing

975
01:32:48,660 --> 01:32:54,700
the graphics for the resurrection scenes and just pretty pretty crazed me crazy but it was never

976
01:32:54,700 --> 01:32:59,940
published in North America because annex closed its US subsidiary before the localization was

977
01:32:59,940 --> 01:33:10,020
finished so the English versions were used that were made for America were released in Europe and

978
01:33:10,020 --> 01:33:19,100
Australian when Nintendo had it ready to go so it also had like a lot of merchandise that came out

979
01:33:19,100 --> 01:33:26,700
with it including a guidebook a World Atlas and a novel and also another novelization of the game

980
01:33:27,660 --> 01:33:35,940
full other art books in two manga based on it to full sorry a two volume manga that was based on

981
01:33:35,940 --> 01:33:44,660
it and these have never been released outside of Japan although Club Nintendo did a 32 page comic

982
01:33:44,660 --> 01:33:54,420
that came out in Germany the soundtrack of course has been released in 1995 and it had the first

983
01:33:54,420 --> 01:34:04,940
six tracks were arranged versions the game music it sold pretty well Famicom sushi gave it a 30 out

984
01:34:04,940 --> 01:34:11,820
of 40 so I mean even so that's not high enough not high enough no it isn't this game's great but

985
01:34:11,820 --> 01:34:18,620
basically this is considered to be like one of the best games that never came out in the u.s.

986
01:34:18,620 --> 01:34:25,180
it's really unfortunate that this whole series was not represented I mean I don't think these

987
01:34:25,180 --> 01:34:29,540
games have a direct relation to each other between terror enigma and brain Lord and illusion a guy

988
01:34:29,540 --> 01:34:33,340
and all that but they're still considered a creation trilogy yeah yeah that's a good way

989
01:34:33,340 --> 01:34:40,540
of putting it a creation trilogy like like a Kevin Smith trilogy with clerks and more like like the

990
01:34:40,540 --> 01:34:47,020
ice cream and blood ones what is the ice cream and bloods cream that they call it for like hot

991
01:34:47,020 --> 01:34:54,100
fuzz Oh and Shaun of the Dead oh okay so the movies with that guy well no because they have

992
01:34:54,100 --> 01:34:59,180
the same brand of ice cream in every yeah in all three of those movies yeah okay okay I got you I

993
01:34:59,180 --> 01:35:03,780
got ya well they had they have big Kahuna burger and all of Tarantino's movies but it well in

994
01:35:03,780 --> 01:35:07,580
Tarantino's already said his movies exist in the same universe yeah but anyway sorry I didn't mean

995
01:35:07,580 --> 01:35:12,060
to cut you off but it's it's really tragic that these games don't exist on like or they're not

996
01:35:12,060 --> 01:35:16,660
represented on the SNES classic at all you know like at least I would have killed to have I'd

997
01:35:16,660 --> 01:35:24,420
rather distant Star Fox to me too me too well we'll just have to wait for S or now that it's

998
01:35:24,420 --> 01:35:29,320
been hacked we'll just wait for SNES classic to electric boogaloo because you know it's only a

999
01:35:29,320 --> 01:35:34,420
matter of time well now that it's already been hacked you know the other loading people are

1000
01:35:34,420 --> 01:35:39,500
loading their own games oh sure on them now that's it's official of course but I'm waiting for that

1001
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:45,780
to be rock-solid before I touch mine well I'm not gonna mod mine because I have a never drive

1002
01:35:45,780 --> 01:35:52,420
although I want the one that will let you do the super FX games I think that'd be great but but

1003
01:35:52,420 --> 01:35:57,140
yeah this game totally worth it if you haven't played it in fact I'm kind of thinking I might

1004
01:35:57,140 --> 01:36:01,980
restart it just because it's been on my mind lately I've been trying to find a PAL copy of

1005
01:36:01,980 --> 01:36:09,180
it for a while haven't had any luck so we'll see all right there it is your classic game of the

1006
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:15,460
week tear enigma on the Super Nintendo sadly never in the US but I'm sure lots of you have played it

1007
01:36:15,460 --> 01:36:22,820
anyway bastards wink before we go to our break Bobby black wolf with a technical question for

1008
01:36:22,820 --> 01:36:28,740
the goddess of the classic game of the week by black wolf wants to know is Starcraft 2 eligible

1009
01:36:28,740 --> 01:36:32,980
for classic game of the week because of its copyright date or does the 10-year timer start

1010
01:36:32,980 --> 01:36:38,540
when the Super Nintendo classic was released my guess would be she did a game that never came out

1011
01:36:38,540 --> 01:36:43,220
before as classic game of the week once because you know the lore and everything behind that so I

1012
01:36:43,220 --> 01:36:48,660
would think under those rules it would be eligible but you're not gonna pick a bad game just kidding

1013
01:36:48,660 --> 01:36:55,020
I'm kidding maybe you can do Stark we can we can we can revisit the thought of Starcraft 2

1014
01:36:55,420 --> 01:37:03,220
you mean Star Fox 2 Star Fox 2 we can we can revisit it because I think I would go by its

1015
01:37:03,220 --> 01:37:08,260
original inception like when it was actually finished why does this Starcraft by the way

1016
01:37:08,260 --> 01:37:14,660
Star Fox 2 it could it could end up there but people could have been playing it for longer

1017
01:37:14,660 --> 01:37:22,300
than 10 years but you're probably not gonna pick it we'll see never say never s2 and her Matt says

1018
01:37:22,300 --> 01:37:27,220
Star Fox 2 would happen sooner than a low to probably that is well none of the halo games are

1019
01:37:27,220 --> 01:37:31,980
gonna be in there so you may as well just forget it unless it's like a halo parody or knockoff like

1020
01:37:31,980 --> 01:37:39,700
the Atari halo yeah Atari halo maybe I'd do Atari halo you go but I wouldn't do like actual halo you

1021
01:37:39,700 --> 01:37:47,180
did and to be and people forget you did marathon at one point so close enough did I yeah you did

1022
01:37:47,180 --> 01:37:54,460
I'm almost positive you did on the Mac like years ago you know that the bungees first game oh yo

1023
01:37:54,460 --> 01:38:01,820
that sorry yeah I was like when did I marathon halo no no the game the game yeah I did marathon

1024
01:38:01,820 --> 01:38:07,940
because it was notable for spawning the garbage that is halo all right sorry it's not garbage

1025
01:38:07,940 --> 01:38:16,780
garbage actually serves a purpose Bobby Black Wolf says you have two more years halo 2600 was

1026
01:38:16,780 --> 01:38:21,840
released in 2009 we'll hold out hope that this show you know will be around that long no it

1027
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:25,780
should there's no reason why it shouldn't but you know no all right we are gonna take a break though

1028
01:38:25,780 --> 01:38:29,940
I know we're we've been around a long time tonight and we're gonna take a break but when we come back

1041
01:39:37,380 --> 01:39:42,700
tonight where I feel like we're not competing against anything on TV for a change it's all

1042
01:39:42,700 --> 01:39:47,500
the big TV shit is Sunday nights but I think we have a reprieve this week right Game of Thrones

1043
01:39:47,500 --> 01:39:53,860
is done is walking dead back I have that is that a thing I have no idea either so I don't think we

1044
01:39:53,860 --> 01:39:59,340
have anything we're competing against right now at least not until what two weeks from now when

1045
01:39:59,340 --> 01:40:03,140
I'm sure everybody's gonna be binging Stranger Things but that comes out on Friday so that's

1046
01:40:03,140 --> 01:40:07,580
so people should be done it's only like eight episodes right change it okay eight episodes

1047
01:40:07,580 --> 01:40:11,420
isn't a lot so you can you can binge that well no actually no it's more Nate episodes it was

1048
01:40:11,420 --> 01:40:15,140
quite a few last time it's like 12 or 13 no stranger things is only like six episodes the

1049
01:40:15,140 --> 01:40:19,500
first time it's more this time I think yeah so I don't know maybe maybe somebody in our chat knows

1050
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:27,940
over at live dot vog network comm where Rama says walking dead is next week oh there you go and

1051
01:40:27,940 --> 01:40:33,620
let's see come on no Gus says Major League Baseball is happening right now well we always have to do

1052
01:40:33,620 --> 01:40:38,420
compete against sports that's that's always if it's not baseball it's football or it's basketball

1053
01:40:38,780 --> 01:40:42,580
there's always something on hockey it you know something's always gonna be on on Sunday night

1054
01:40:42,580 --> 01:40:49,340
okay Kaijuto says it was eight the first the first season was eight okay maybe it is ten this time

1055
01:40:49,340 --> 01:40:56,300
then you're right it is more this time okay let's move on though less TV more games rapid-fire news

1056
01:40:56,300 --> 01:41:01,500
starting with Loki this is kind of a weird place to play games but apparently there is a Russian

1057
01:41:01,500 --> 01:41:08,140
made van and truck company it called I guess gazelle and their gazelle next vans and trucks

1058
01:41:08,140 --> 01:41:15,300
have a Easter egg hidden in them in fact apparently in this vans dash you can play Tetris but how you

1059
01:41:15,300 --> 01:41:21,860
unlock it it's quite complicated so they have actually some basic instructions so first you

1060
01:41:21,860 --> 01:41:28,200
would turn the ignition on start the car activate the right turn signal for three blinks then you

1061
01:41:28,200 --> 01:41:36,120
would do two clicks of the trip odometer reset twice and says and then push the clutch five

1062
01:41:36,120 --> 01:41:45,400
times and then rev the engine to 2,000 rpm while turning on the left turn indicator this sounds a

1063
01:41:45,400 --> 01:41:51,400
lot like that Rainbow Road Tesla thing that Bobby did a video for at the fog network YouTube plug

1064
01:41:51,400 --> 01:41:58,080
plug but I mean seriously there was that YouTube that he did which showed that except that wasn't

1065
01:41:58,200 --> 01:42:03,040
really a game he actually showed that to me when I was in Atlanta and he was taking me there yeah

1066
01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:08,040
you can actually play it well you can turn the dial or whatever to move the pieces back and forth

1067
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:13,160
and I think you click on the other dial to drop them so it's it's neat that you can do that why

1068
01:42:13,160 --> 01:42:18,960
you don't do that I don't know you must be incredibly bored you must really want to play

1069
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:23,480
Tetris Tetris on it's like just like there's people that really want to play NES golf on the

1070
01:42:23,480 --> 01:42:32,720
switch these hacks and things happening yeah so apparently I mean it's a thing but it's just okay

1071
01:42:32,720 --> 01:42:40,640
that's kind of a head scratcher kind of like Sony making a movie based on the settlers of Catan I

1072
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:47,640
can't imagine how that would be there really is no story in the settlers of Catan except for trading

1073
01:42:47,640 --> 01:42:53,800
and screwing people over by you know building the longest road and you know what they made a

1074
01:42:53,800 --> 01:42:59,920
movie off of clue it was one of the best things ever so why not then of course they made a movie

1075
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:05,520
out of battleship and it was terrible they also made a movie out of you know I feel like I've

1076
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:09,640
asked this before media and that was pretty terribly nice him in the movie right it was

1077
01:43:09,640 --> 01:43:18,320
did he get a chance to say you suck my battleship I don't cuz like oh if nobody in that movie

1078
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:23,880
screams you sunk my battleship then that movie ain't worth shit now to be fair apparently this

1079
01:43:23,880 --> 01:43:32,200
is being okay so this is being driven though they've got basically a few people on board

1080
01:43:32,200 --> 01:43:41,240
so Dan Lin Gale Katz and Jonathan Eric will produce the film and I guess blaze Hemingway

1081
01:43:41,240 --> 01:43:46,160
will write the screenplay now some of those names may not sound familiar cats I guess they said he's

1082
01:43:46,160 --> 01:43:53,200
done 20 or films over the last 20 years including the line of fire in Air Force One I guess Lin has

1083
01:43:53,200 --> 01:44:01,000
had several movies as well including the new it that you've produced a Sherlock Holmes the Lego

1084
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:10,800
movie the invention of lying also Terminator salvation gangsters go on death note so I don't

1085
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:16,040
know I didn't mean it's even here miss with some of these Sony movies but I honestly don't know

1086
01:44:16,040 --> 01:44:21,600
where they would go with this because the it's if there's no plot to the game there's no backstory

1087
01:44:21,600 --> 01:44:26,640
it's just kind of this game so I don't know what the hell they would do with this other than okay

1088
01:44:26,640 --> 01:44:35,960
it's a medieval movie about settling its people people settling in the role of Catan at least the

1089
01:44:35,960 --> 01:44:41,160
Oregon Trail had a story behind it yeah like that would be alright but you could just do a movie

1090
01:44:41,160 --> 01:44:46,840
based on the actual Oregon Trail you have to remember that game was based on actual events

1091
01:44:46,840 --> 01:44:53,400
it's a little different settlers of Catan isn't based on anything so alright anyhow hey maybe a

1092
01:44:53,400 --> 01:44:57,400
movie worry or excuse me movie a movie that actually has a series that could get a movie

1093
01:44:57,400 --> 01:45:03,720
someday civilization all right I feel big cities why I don't know if I would be comfortable with

1094
01:45:03,720 --> 01:45:11,200
seeing Gandhi as this evil overlord I'm down that's true anyway civilization 6 which was a

1095
01:45:11,200 --> 01:45:16,960
game I was playing not that long ago actually they're getting some tweaks coming up the latest

1096
01:45:16,960 --> 01:45:21,920
update for the game has been announced by Firaxis and it's going to be kind of really tinkering the

1097
01:45:21,960 --> 01:45:26,360
religion aspect of the game is going to be getting the biggest overhaul religion is a victory

1098
01:45:26,360 --> 01:45:29,800
condition in the game right now but apparently it's one of the ones that's a little bit broken

1099
01:45:29,800 --> 01:45:35,080
it doesn't work quite as well so so new beliefs and religious units will be coming out with the

1100
01:45:35,080 --> 01:45:40,440
game there's also going to be two new pantheons in that new founder follower enhancer and worship

1101
01:45:40,440 --> 01:45:45,520
beliefs some new buildings and a new combat unit called the warrior monk which sounds like it might

1102
01:45:45,520 --> 01:45:49,080
tie into religions it sounds like they're really kind of inflating that part of the game this is

1103
01:45:49,080 --> 01:45:54,560
not DLC it's actually a patch that's going to be happening which is pretty cool I would have

1104
01:45:54,560 --> 01:45:59,400
thought maybe this would be the year well I guess they just sieve six was last year's game so maybe

1105
01:45:59,400 --> 01:46:04,680
next year we're gonna see something kind of what did they call it beyond Earth those is the Alpha

1106
01:46:04,680 --> 01:46:08,800
Centauri but I think they did beyond Earth on Civ fives engine so to be interesting to see if we

1107
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:16,520
get the Civ 6 in space or maybe maybe something else Civ 4 got the colonization reimagining so

1108
01:46:16,520 --> 01:46:20,400
maybe they'll do something else with Civ 6's engine but that would probably be around next

1109
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:27,880
year but this year you get some balancing issues and that'll be good also in news with this the

1110
01:46:27,880 --> 01:46:33,400
news this week I was going to bring up this story from our pals of Bahmani style calm but their

1111
01:46:33,400 --> 01:46:37,920
website appears to be down right now I guess too many people are all story oh so hopefully somebody

1112
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:43,800
is also seen this but I know the article was about harmonics collecting the best rock band stories

1113
01:46:43,800 --> 01:46:50,160
out there for a 10-year celebration of rock band all in related news rock band is 10 years old

1114
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:57,480
that's a game of the week yeah I know right that makes me feel really old but that is that's where

1115
01:46:57,480 --> 01:47:02,240
we're at rock band is that old and so they're collecting some good stories and memories there

1116
01:47:02,240 --> 01:47:08,680
probably to do some sort of retrospective that they're working on there so I'm sure we have a

1117
01:47:08,760 --> 01:47:14,920
few I know that I always thought that um loud event that you know seg was on the show promoting

1118
01:47:14,920 --> 01:47:19,360
a couple times was pretty cool and I did I got to do the hosting thing for one year that was a

1119
01:47:19,360 --> 01:47:27,120
lot of fun so hopefully that would be something that will make it into the memories book so all

1120
01:47:27,120 --> 01:47:33,240
right dark Sakura what do you have for rapid-fire news oh just some stuff in fact the thing that I

1121
01:47:33,240 --> 01:47:42,400
actually would rather like to have only for one game the this thing called the super retrocade

1122
01:47:42,400 --> 01:47:48,080
is going to be launching this year and it has a lot of Capcom and Data East stuff on it the game

1123
01:47:48,080 --> 01:47:55,800
I am most interested in is being able to play three wonders at home on my TV that would be

1124
01:47:55,800 --> 01:48:05,080
great but it comes has wired controllers you can do save states SD card support HDMI AV out and 90

1125
01:48:05,080 --> 01:48:12,720
titles so that'll be cool if the emulation is good yeah 90s good well apparently their last console

1126
01:48:12,720 --> 01:48:18,040
emulation one so good so they got to work on that and then something else too and I've actually seen

1127
01:48:18,040 --> 01:48:25,280
some of this being played is a Jersey Jack is releasing a new Pirates of the Caribbean pinball

1128
01:48:25,280 --> 01:48:32,840
that blows the other one out of the water haha pirate joke are I get it but it has like this

1129
01:48:32,840 --> 01:48:39,480
like whirlpool and you can shoot cannons back and forth between two ships in this little triple

1130
01:48:39,480 --> 01:48:45,280
spinner in the middle that really makes for some unpredictable ball control it's it's really nice

1131
01:48:45,280 --> 01:48:55,480
it is really good and if you don't know Jersey Jack did the tables that they did did was the

1132
01:48:55,480 --> 01:49:03,520
Hobbit and Wizard of Oz and the third one I can't remember what it was but they did it so this is

1133
01:49:03,520 --> 01:49:09,440
their fourth table I know very cool all right yeah they're like a they're like a newer pinball

1134
01:49:09,440 --> 01:49:14,960
company right they have some stuff at the coin op here locally I feel like one or two of those

1135

01:54:29,620 --> 01:54:34,100
to get into though and then we'll open up our skype line at orange lounge radio on skype all

1186
01:54:34,100 --> 01:54:38,500
one word let's get to those stories first though starting with Loki yes this week they have the

1187
01:54:38,500 --> 01:54:43,780
oculus connect event so they made several announcements regarding the oculus platform

1188
01:54:43,780 --> 01:54:49,980
so along with that of course is that the price drop that they did back in the summer for the

1189
01:54:49,980 --> 01:54:57,420
oculus rift is now gonna be permanent so that'll be $3.99 now for the headset and two sensors and

1190
01:54:57,420 --> 01:55:02,860
the touch controllers and I guess a bunch of games so you can check that out also they announce that

1191
01:55:02,980 --> 01:55:09,180
their standalone headset that's gonna be its own platform that doesn't require any sort of phone

1192
01:55:09,180 --> 01:55:14,660
or anything is gonna be coming out pretty soon that is the oculus go it's gonna be coming up for

1193
01:55:14,660 --> 01:55:23,900
$199 and apparently you know it is gonna be its own standalone thing it's gonna have a single palm

1194
01:55:23,900 --> 01:55:30,540
controller kind of similar to what they have with the oc the gear VR so it's gonna be a little bit

1195
01:55:30,540 --> 01:55:35,740
different in that sense then they also announced there was yet another platform that they were

1196
01:55:35,740 --> 01:55:39,820
working on but that's not they're sending out dev kits for that right now so that's something

1197
01:55:39,820 --> 01:55:45,580
that's in the future but it's gonna be kind of think similar long lines of the oculus go but

1198
01:55:45,580 --> 01:55:51,860
more souped up it probably more expensive along with that they were showing off some new games

1199
01:55:51,860 --> 01:55:56,980
that are gonna be coming out for the rift one of which is being worked on by respawn entertainment

1200
01:55:56,980 --> 01:56:04,540
so they've you know got a game coming as well I'm not sure exactly what it's gonna be but they've

1201
01:56:04,540 --> 01:56:08,940
made some pretty cool games Bobby's in our chat room over at live dot vog network comm saying

1202
01:56:08,940 --> 01:56:14,060
that oculus go is the gear VR but without the phone requirements that's pretty much the level

1203
01:56:14,060 --> 01:56:19,580
of awesome you can expect out of that yeah I mean it's something it's something you know if you're

1204
01:56:19,580 --> 01:56:23,780
if you're an Apple person you know you know you don't really have access to gear VR so this is

1205
01:56:23,780 --> 01:56:29,460
some way you could do that so I mean Alan has the gear VR cuz he got his when he got his galaxy

1206
01:56:29,460 --> 01:56:35,780
yeah I I have one but mines for these six so it's pretty old and they've used it the first day and

1207
01:56:35,780 --> 01:56:45,380
we haven't used it since just saying I've used it a couple times I use the gear the oculus F kid to

1208
01:56:45,380 --> 01:56:49,620
more than I have the gear VR and honestly I don't like using it with my phone too much because my

1209
01:56:49,620 --> 01:56:55,900
phone screens kind of it's not as high resolution as it could possibly be and I don't know it's just

1210
01:56:55,900 --> 01:57:00,460
the stuff that you can get on the phone games it's not all that great they've got minecraft

1211
01:57:00,460 --> 01:57:03,940
which is kind of cool but I would be more interested in something now that I have a more

1212
01:57:03,940 --> 01:57:09,980
powerful PC that can actually do VR more interested in playing that in fact actually having bothered to

1213
01:57:09,980 --> 01:57:16,180
hook up my DK to to my PC but I'm kind of curious to see what that would be like now they can run

1214
01:57:16,180 --> 01:57:21,580
the frame rates for some of those games mm-hmm but I do want to get an actual oculus headset

1215
01:57:21,580 --> 01:57:25,620
at some point or vibe five is more expensive though but hopefully with them dropping the price

1216
01:57:25,620 --> 01:57:30,820
permanently that'll drive them to drop their price yeah there's a little VR refresh happening going

1217
01:57:30,820 --> 01:57:36,660
on right now cuz PlayStation VR just had their Japan just got right and then also there's still

1218
01:57:36,660 --> 01:57:42,080
all those other VR devices that are gonna be coming for like Windows for like Windows

1219
01:57:42,080 --> 01:57:48,560
holographic and stuff like that so you know where are those because those are supposed to be cheaper

1220
01:57:48,560 --> 01:57:54,920
in price as well so eventually it'll be just like buying a monitor mm-hmm yeah me interesting all

1221
01:57:54,920 --> 01:57:59,960
right well moving on maybe maybe a game that you can play in VR if they're making it for it I don't

1222
01:57:59,960 --> 01:58:05,600
know is riot games next game because it is funny that they're called riot games when they only

1223
01:58:05,600 --> 01:58:10,520
really have one game which of course is League of Legends if you weren't already aware now League

1224
01:58:10,520 --> 01:58:17,600
of Legends has been a game that's been around since what 11 years been a while at least riot

1225
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:22,040
games been around since 2006 I don't think League of Legends came out right away but it's been out a

1226
01:58:22,040 --> 01:58:27,320
little while but anyway the two founders of riot games did say this week they are handing off the

1227
01:58:27,320 --> 01:58:32,280
management of League of Legends to other folks so they can make a new game it will be the second

1228
01:58:32,280 --> 01:58:38,280
big video game released for riot games in their time that they have been operating so that's

1229
01:58:38,280 --> 01:58:43,400
pretty awesome so they are gonna be handing over those operations to the chief financial officer

1230
01:58:43,400 --> 01:58:48,080
so as the chief technical officer and the president of the company we don't know what that game is

1231
01:58:48,080 --> 01:58:55,320
gonna look like we may see some type of phone game who knows or maybe they would get into making who

1232
01:58:55,320 --> 01:59:01,440
knows an MMO they could do anything so we'll see what riot games decides to develop and to be fair

1233
01:59:01,440 --> 01:59:08,160
I guess they actually have done tabletop tabletop and small games so the s in riot games is

1234
01:59:08,160 --> 01:59:15,080
justified but as far as like you know games on video of sorts go this is really the only one

1235
01:59:15,080 --> 01:59:20,000
they've got so they'll have another one oh maybe in like seven years when they finally finish it

1236
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:23,400
right because video games take a little while to work on I don't know if you guys know video

1237
01:59:23,400 --> 01:59:28,360
games take a while to finish right low-key loot boxes are hard to develop yes right they have to

1238
01:59:28,360 --> 01:59:32,480
find that I've already had to work in all my monetization stuff you know that's that's why

1239
01:59:32,480 --> 01:59:36,880
I'm planning first because as I've been shown by the triple-a industry that is the most important

1240
01:59:36,880 --> 01:59:41,040
does League of Legends have loot boxes I don't think it does they have it's like the in-game

1241
01:59:41,040 --> 01:59:45,520
gold that you earn and then you use that in-game gold to buy the skins and stuff I thought we had

1242
01:59:45,520 --> 01:59:50,440
buy it skins because obviously it's a free-to-play game you gotta be making their money some earn in

1243
01:59:50,440 --> 01:59:55,640
game gold slowly or you put the money now it's like Heroes of the Storm used to be before Heroes

1244
01:59:55,640 --> 02:00:01,320
of the Storm put in loot boxes and now Heroes of the Storm runs on once again though both free

1245
02:00:01,320 --> 02:00:05,760
games I don't care that's I'm fine with that if it's a free game right it's just that double

1246
02:00:05,760 --> 02:00:12,040
dipping feeling that I don't like right all right but we won't rehash the conversation from earlier

1247
02:00:12,040 --> 02:00:18,120
so let's move on to what Dark Sakura has for us I got some stuff you want to see what I have sure

1248
02:00:18,120 --> 02:00:24,360
it has to do with Minecraft um never mind just kidding Minecraft still cool well you know how

1249
02:00:24,360 --> 02:00:30,800
people have built these like amazing recreations of like Helms Deep and all of this business well

1250
02:00:30,800 --> 02:00:41,080
there is a like a sculpture event that happens in Minecraft there's one that's called the perfect

1251
02:00:41,080 --> 02:00:49,680
marionette that won first place in the contest and I mean it is massive and it's a full-on

1252
02:00:49,800 --> 02:00:56,240
sculpture I mean if you look at it closer yeah you can see it's made up of little bricks but I mean

1253
02:00:56,240 --> 02:01:03,520
just from a distance it looks like a full-on like sculpture sculpture and there are like just some

1254
02:01:03,520 --> 02:01:10,920
crazy ones like one looks like a an explosion in mid explode and just all these other things it's

1255
02:01:10,920 --> 02:01:16,400
absolutely amazing and the fact that you know this game has quite literally turned into an art form

1256
02:01:16,400 --> 02:01:21,200
I was gonna say like some people paint with watercolor some people paint with oils some

1257
02:01:21,200 --> 02:01:26,640
people are using Minecraft it's crazy but like awesome but it still requires I think some of the

1258
02:01:26,640 --> 02:01:32,760
same skills that one would have in doing any type of sculpture or other kind of rendering absolutely

1259
02:01:32,760 --> 02:01:37,920
to do a proper sculpture you have to have your sense of movement you have to have your son well

1260
02:01:37,920 --> 02:01:44,520
I'd say dynamic movement you also have to have your color balance you have to have scale I mean

1261
02:01:44,840 --> 02:01:50,840
it's really some amazing work these people have done I knew a gal years ago and I mean years ago

1262
02:01:50,840 --> 02:01:55,560
like back when I first did Rocky Horror at the bird cage that's how long ago was right I knew

1263
02:01:55,560 --> 02:02:02,680
this gal and one hobby that she used to enjoy she made paintings but she did them in MS paint I kid

1264
02:02:02,680 --> 02:02:09,480
you not she did them pixel by pixel she would zoom in all this is she could do her little art pixel

1265
02:02:09,480 --> 02:02:14,200
by pixel and I I can't help but think you know I've lost touch with her over the years I have no

1266
02:02:14,200 --> 02:02:18,680
idea where she is today but if she's discovered minecraft like that would be perfect for her

1267
02:02:18,680 --> 02:02:23,960
because isn't that what minecraft is basically this it's sculpting pixel by pixel right sort

1268
02:02:23,960 --> 02:02:29,880
of it really is and yeah I've seen I've seen some amazing work done in MS paint so it's really the

1269
02:02:29,880 --> 02:02:34,240
equivalent oh yeah remember when they tried to get rid of it people lost their shit because they

1270
02:02:34,240 --> 02:02:40,480
were going to 3d paint or whatever yeah yeah so they're MS paint that's right but there's there's

1271
02:02:40,480 --> 02:02:46,280
some website now what was that site you could you could go on there and it's just like MS paint you

1272
02:02:46,280 --> 02:02:51,480
make your drawing but like it saves it on the web and you can like share your drawings other people

1273
02:02:51,480 --> 02:03:00,160
dang there's some art site and used to be like a game people would do I remember though it was it

1274
02:03:00,160 --> 02:03:05,600
was a networked art program and I can't remember what it was called but I used to use it all the

1275
02:03:05,680 --> 02:03:13,600
time where we just get like it was actually I was I was using it with Tiara and our friend Kim and

1276
02:03:13,600 --> 02:03:20,120
we would and a few other people but we would all get into like have a live server and play in this

1277
02:03:20,120 --> 02:03:26,200
graphics program dark Tetsuya says oh a cocky no I think I remember oh a cocky though I think that

1278
02:03:26,200 --> 02:03:31,080
was yeah I'm that's close to what I'm thinking of but that's not it I remember oh a cocky that

1279
02:03:31,080 --> 02:03:37,880
was like that's more like a type though that was that's like a 1998 thing yeah well really um but

1280
02:03:37,880 --> 02:03:44,280
now I can't remember what it was called but it was really fun I mean and now especially I'd say

1281
02:03:44,280 --> 02:03:48,480
that's even one of our earlier precursors to the you know now collaborative applications we have

1282
02:03:48,480 --> 02:03:56,640
but still I mean I love watching people turn the most unexpected thing into real art you know so

1283
02:03:56,640 --> 02:04:03,080
it's pretty cool yeah all right well you go artists in Minecraft meanwhile Loki all right

1284
02:04:03,080 --> 02:04:09,800
so kind of keeping on track with VR of course not to be out valve had some announcements regarding

1285
02:04:09,800 --> 02:04:17,600
additional components to developing VR systems for device manufacturers basically the new technology

1286
02:04:17,600 --> 02:04:24,960
is available with the free license that's available for valves room scale VR tracking technology and

1287
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:30,120
they say it includes an optical system manufacturing calibration tools and software

1288
02:04:30,120 --> 02:04:38,720
that aims to make a better user experience and says the new features now they're meant to allow

1289
02:04:38,720 --> 02:04:45,920
I guess better you know steam VR compatible head-mounted displays also increased sharpness

1290
02:04:45,920 --> 02:04:52,880
head tracking and that sort of thing so that's cool once again you know it's like we saw with

1291
02:04:52,880 --> 02:04:58,240
these other companies developing their own VR devices that are kind of giving you compatible

1292
02:04:58,240 --> 02:05:03,000
with one platform I think Val's taking a smart approach with it too because you know unlike

1293
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:07,960
oculus it's kind of like okay we've got our own storefront that's separate from everything valve

1294
02:05:07,960 --> 02:05:12,400
is like okay hey let's make as many devices as we can that support steam because everybody uses

1295
02:05:12,400 --> 02:05:19,400
team so why not I'm all for that especially that means I'm gonna get a cheaper headset later on

1296
02:05:19,400 --> 02:05:25,880
that's still pretty good the price of this technology is coming down and I think that's

1297
02:05:25,880 --> 02:05:31,240
how more and more people are gonna end up adopting it sooner or later yeah sooner or later and then

1298
02:05:31,240 --> 02:05:35,040
more and more applications are becoming available better applications because right now we're still

1299
02:05:35,040 --> 02:05:40,960
kind of in that whole Nintendo DS touchscreen thing where no one knows how to utilize the tech

1300
02:05:40,960 --> 02:05:48,280
they're just kind of like doing these gimmicky games it's gonna be more smartly used I guess so

1301
02:05:48,680 --> 02:05:54,600
check that out well and finally in the news tonight something that you've been waiting all

1302
02:05:54,600 --> 02:05:59,160
show for because Jason referenced it in tonight's introduction a big thanks to Jason by the way he

1303
02:05:59,160 --> 02:06:03,160
always does those intros to our show we appreciate it I'm gonna miss them next week as he'll be at

1304
02:06:03,160 --> 02:06:06,880
twitch con so you're stuck with me and looks like unless I can get a guest announcer maybe we'll try

1305
02:06:06,880 --> 02:06:15,760
to get a guest announcer next week but anyway this is a new playable character for WWE 2k 18

1306
02:06:15,800 --> 02:06:20,160
I don't know if you guys play those games at all but if you do you can look forward to a brand new

1307
02:06:20,160 --> 02:06:25,400
playable character in WWE and you might be wondering well which wrestler is this based off

1308
02:06:25,400 --> 02:06:31,480
of is it is it going to be my twin Sami Zayn well he might be in the game too but this particular

1309
02:06:31,480 --> 02:06:39,280
character I want to talk about is Colonel Sanders that's right Colonel Sanders KFC his character

1310
02:06:39,320 --> 02:06:47,480
now there is catch you have to assemble him in create a wrestler but you can actually do it

1311
02:06:47,480 --> 02:06:53,400
because I guess the guests are sponsored achievements and trophies in this too boy

1312
02:06:53,400 --> 02:06:58,520
you think loot boxes are bad here's a glimpse at the future on our last they already do that

1313
02:06:58,520 --> 02:07:03,760
they like in Madden they ever they had advertisements in Madden for like other

1314
02:07:03,760 --> 02:07:07,840
things not talking about like integrated into the arenas like you know you'd see

1315
02:07:07,840 --> 02:07:11,760
well they actually integrate into the loading screens like for cell phone service and stuff

1316
02:07:11,760 --> 02:07:20,280
like that so that's been a thing and sponsored stuff I mean it's silly but this kind of stuff

1317
02:07:20,280 --> 02:07:26,560
I like it's just dumb I mean who doesn't want to see Colonel Sanders beating down people the

1318
02:07:26,560 --> 02:07:34,200
question is why is it more you know we need more of this like I know I want Colonel Sanders to be

1319
02:07:34,200 --> 02:07:38,440
beating up the scary King thing from Burger King that I don't even thinks been the mascot for years

1320
02:07:38,440 --> 02:07:43,720
we still need our and Wendy because all those companies yeah have you seen Burger King and

1321
02:07:43,720 --> 02:07:49,960
Wendy on Twitter recently they are savage to each other they are not nice like this

1322
02:07:49,960 --> 02:07:57,200
2017 you guys when you when you can't wait to be dragged by a corporate brand on Twitter and then

1323
02:07:57,200 --> 02:08:02,200
we have Arby's being cool with their marketing yeah Arby's Arby's does Arby's the only thing

1324
02:08:02,320 --> 02:08:07,440
Arby's has going for it is they have a 50 50 50 shake that's like an orange cream shake that's

1325
02:08:07,440 --> 02:08:13,120
fucking awesome everything else at Arby's fucking terrible I would disagree with that I split a

1326
02:08:13,120 --> 02:08:18,920
sandwich with Dan and there was so much meat in it that it was two sandwiches worth it was pretty

1327
02:08:18,920 --> 02:08:25,240
good deal yeah but it's like now if I can get whoever does those ads to make like little you

1328
02:08:25,240 --> 02:08:30,920
know sculptures for me I would my favorite was a little peach on one they did for Rama it was so

1329
02:08:30,920 --> 02:08:38,720
cute mm-hmm like a meat sculpture I mean their ads are they take like the the their sandwich

1330
02:08:38,720 --> 02:08:45,680
boxes and make like anime figures and video game figures and scenes from like the other day they

1331
02:08:45,680 --> 02:08:51,000
did like an emu yasha one they're so cute oh see that must have been what happened was they

1332
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:55,360
converted their box into a sandwich and that's what I ate because it's certainly what it tasted

1333
02:08:55,360 --> 02:09:02,520
like all right well that is our last story that we have up for the night so that means it's time

1334
02:09:02,520 --> 02:09:08,480
for the Skype line and you can give us a call over at orange lounge radio all one word on Skype if

1343
02:09:49,680 --> 02:09:54,520
we're gonna be on this rig for a little while sadly until we can test some new things Loki is

1344
02:09:54,520 --> 02:10:00,520
gonna be bringing the laptop into this so we can test a conversion over and yeah I'm just paranoid

1345
02:10:00,520 --> 02:10:05,200
about some new things but Loki has a computer we can play with so that's exciting well I will

1346
02:10:05,200 --> 02:10:09,560
email you about that because that's how we do our Skype line for our show fabulous I'd like to know

1347
02:10:09,560 --> 02:10:14,620
more about it well what's on your mind tonight well I just want to say that the Twitter accounts

1348
02:10:14,620 --> 02:10:22,220
for Arby's Wendy's and Burger King gives me life it gets me through my day and Denny's which God

1349
02:10:22,220 --> 02:10:29,980
what what shit food no but it's more Wendy's because of lewd Wendy and everybody I know

1350
02:10:29,980 --> 02:10:37,020
cosplaying her it was yeah do people actually cosplay the Wendy's character and Ronald McDonald

1351
02:10:37,020 --> 02:10:40,980
of course they do why asking this question there's a reddit for people posting their

1352
02:10:40,980 --> 02:10:44,940
boobies next to Pokemon of course people can of course you know like with Saints Row freckle

1353
02:10:44,940 --> 02:10:51,740
bitches that's really a thing that's really a thing because for a while somebody in one Asian

1354
02:10:51,740 --> 02:10:58,980
countries I forget where actually did a gingka forms of all of the fast-food mascots and there

1355
02:10:58,980 --> 02:11:04,940
were short run doujins and people were cosplaying them unless you probably missed it when I was

1356
02:11:04,940 --> 02:11:09,980
posting them on Facebook but when I posted Colonel Sanders a third of women were like daddy

1357
02:11:10,460 --> 02:11:19,340
oh my god no I I did miss that there's the way he was drawn all the women were like hi I guess

1358
02:11:19,340 --> 02:11:26,340
I haven't they kind of like redone Colonel Sanders anyway he's not they de-aged him a few years maybe

1359
02:11:26,340 --> 02:11:38,660
not just a skosh but um it's a skosh what what's good here um I feel you on the YouTube strikes

1360
02:11:38,700 --> 02:11:47,420
because every time we go to a con and we upload interviews and masquerades I get strikes from Sony

1361
02:11:47,420 --> 02:11:54,660
Warner all of them because of the music and I'm like these are not monetary videos keep up here

1362
02:11:54,660 --> 02:11:59,860
for free leave me alone and yeah you're only using if you use a little clip you're not really

1363
02:11:59,860 --> 02:12:04,580
supposed to be able to I mean that's still like fair use or whatever so it's just okay you're

1364
02:12:04,580 --> 02:12:10,100
taking problem yeah the problem is the fact when people do their skits they're using commercial

1365
02:12:10,100 --> 02:12:15,860
music and it's like you can't tell no and I see nothing wrong with I'm not charging it's like

1366
02:12:15,860 --> 02:12:22,300
people just want to see what they miss because they couldn't go that weekend right yeah I guess

1367
02:12:22,300 --> 02:12:27,620
but what happens ultimately they put the claim on your video but they don't really get to do

1368
02:12:27,620 --> 02:12:31,780
anything right they run ads and then they get the revenue okay so they're running ads and they get

1369
02:12:31,780 --> 02:12:36,180
the revenue and also one or two things happen either they will be like okay you ain't got to

1370
02:12:36,180 --> 02:12:41,220
worry about it it's fine or you get an email saying your video has been muted in this country

1371
02:12:41,220 --> 02:12:47,340
this video is our bit this country and then you get work this video has been pulled so I have I

1372
02:12:47,340 --> 02:12:53,460
had it bookmarked somewhere this little text of paraphrase text of fear use they copy paste in

1373
02:12:53,460 --> 02:12:58,900
and I send it to that to YouTube and usually within about three days they like okay fine video

1374
02:12:59,060 --> 02:13:05,380
is good to go it's the whole the whole kid dancing to Prince thing right didn't that go all the way

1375
02:13:05,380 --> 02:13:11,620
to the Supreme Court and the they they sided with the the person it was like the little kid in the

1376
02:13:11,620 --> 02:13:17,300
video dancing to a prince song right what do we miss that so I don't know hmm I'm trying to

1377
02:13:17,300 --> 02:13:23,620
remember yeah yeah they ruled in the favor of the family not the music company or you can just

1378
02:13:23,620 --> 02:13:28,420
always do what Jim Sterling does which is the whole copyright deadlock so instead of instead

1379
02:13:28,420 --> 02:13:32,820
of using you know if you know that there's gonna be like a video flag like say you have

1380
02:13:32,820 --> 02:13:37,380
Nintendo content in there what you do is you throw in random content from other providers

1381
02:13:37,380 --> 02:13:42,900
that you know are gonna get flagged as well so he'll throw in like Activision stuff and Sony

1382
02:13:42,900 --> 02:13:48,500
music stuff and the problem is is everybody creates a copyright claim on the the chat on

1383
02:13:48,500 --> 02:13:56,420
the piece of video and since you know multiple people can't be the owner of that con copyright

1384
02:13:56,420 --> 02:14:02,100
content nothing happens to it either I get the money or no one gets exactly none of them get

1385
02:14:02,100 --> 02:14:07,140
the money I even got flagged by Nintendo okay yeah I've had a couple videos back flagged by

1386
02:14:07,140 --> 02:14:12,100
Nintendo but to be fair it was like my let's remember you know when I first was trying to

1387
02:14:12,100 --> 02:14:17,780
streamy stuff of Legend of Zelda which you know okay fine they had a they had a case to it I wish

1388
02:14:17,780 --> 02:14:23,780
there was just a way we could like split revenue instead of but well you can you can you can sign

1389
02:14:23,780 --> 02:14:31,620
up as one of their partners and you get a tiny pittance of their uh revenue hard pass yeah the

1390

1411
02:16:38,980 --> 02:16:44,180

02:16:48,340 --> 02:16:52,820
something we're looking at hopefully for next year Rob we'll do we'll have fabulous week again real

1414
02:16:52,820 --> 02:16:58,900
soon seriously sounds good I'm gonna hold you to that better all right take care of my friend

1415
02:16:58,900 --> 02:17:03,700
thanks for calling too bro take care all right bye all right we're gonna uh open up the skype

1416
02:17:03,700 --> 02:17:07,940
line again for anyone else who wants to call over at orange lounge radio all one word on skype if

1417
02:17:07,940 --> 02:17:11,380
you'd like to give us a call to talk about whatever's on your mind tonight regarding

1418
02:17:11,380 --> 02:17:16,420
video games hopefully but I don't know it's been a short part b compared to part a who knows all

1419
02:17:16,420 --> 02:17:20,260
right well at least the phones are lighting up tonight so the emails might have disappointed but

1420
02:17:20,260 --> 02:17:24,900
the phones so far at least are not so the only thing about using this little ipad thing is it

1421
02:17:24,900 --> 02:17:29,300
takes a little longer to connect and then sometimes the callers hang up anyway so uh

1422
02:17:29,300 --> 02:17:33,780
that just would happen there so we'll have to wait and see if that person calls back

1423
02:17:34,660 --> 02:17:38,500
uh loki did you have a last minute story while we try to wait for another call here at orange

1424
02:17:38,500 --> 02:17:46,500
andreo on skype no not really i mean um bethesda did another twitter like post for wolfenstein

1425
02:17:47,300 --> 02:17:53,940
um and of course you know it's the whole you know make not make america nazi free again type stuff

1426
02:17:53,940 --> 02:17:59,940
oh yes well they had one now that's basically kind of a new one on top of that that said

1427
02:17:59,940 --> 02:18:05,700
there's only one side to this and so if you're a nazi then like fuck off or something to that

1428
02:18:05,700 --> 02:18:09,060
fact all right well we have another caller on the line so let's get to it hi you're on orange

1429
02:18:09,060 --> 02:18:15,220
lounge radio who's this hey this is act deaf hey act deaf what's on your mind buddy well finally

1430
02:18:15,220 --> 02:18:23,140
my sns classic the story came to a good ending yay i heard i i saw this on twitter so you finally

1431
02:18:23,940 --> 02:18:30,420
got your sns classic right yeah i finally did after two weeks but yeah i finally did so what

1432
02:18:30,420 --> 02:18:35,460
happened did amazon try to make nice nice or was it just out of the blue suddenly they were like

1433
02:18:35,460 --> 02:18:44,260
oh we got it now yeah it was totally out of the blue uh on wednesday like wednesday morning uh

1434
02:18:44,260 --> 02:18:52,660
i got an email for one of my sns classic orders that said i was going to get it next wednesday

1435
02:18:52,740 --> 02:18:59,620
until the 18th and then i uh and i started searching on twitter if any uh any other person

1436
02:19:00,420 --> 02:19:06,580
and people uh started getting their emails and yeah it's um uh a lot of people started getting

1437
02:19:06,580 --> 02:19:15,460
emails and and yeah i i then got another email confirming about my other sns classic order

1438
02:19:15,460 --> 02:19:24,260
for a friend so it was great but i didn't expect it that amazon the next day sent me a notification

1439
02:19:24,260 --> 02:19:31,060
about oh you're getting this sns classic tomorrow delivered i'm like whoa really yeah maybe that

1440
02:19:31,060 --> 02:19:36,180
was their kind of like nice nice thing was that since they took so long instead of doing the two

1441
02:19:36,180 --> 02:19:41,300
day shipping they went ahead and bumped it up to the overnight shipping maybe that was their little

1442
02:19:41,300 --> 02:19:49,380
consolation whatever they could do yeah most probably but i'm happy that i got it and probably

1443
02:19:49,380 --> 02:19:54,980
earlier than i then i expected i would have loved it that they would have fulfilled the order

1444
02:19:55,700 --> 02:20:02,340
on time at all but it this is better than nothing at least so i don't have to finally have one i

1445
02:20:02,340 --> 02:20:07,860
bet uh question from our chat over at live.vognetwork.com ssj100 matt says so are you

1446
02:20:07,860 --> 02:20:11,860
going to keep amazon prime after all this because it seemed like an issue with nintendo

1447
02:20:11,860 --> 02:20:15,220
more than amazon then again they didn't look good with the treasure truck stuff

1448
02:20:16,820 --> 02:20:21,780
i'm gonna keep amazon not because of amazon itself because of twitch

1449
02:20:24,020 --> 02:20:30,980
okay yeah since since i do use the the free subscription thank you for that and

1450
02:20:32,340 --> 02:20:37,700
and yeah especially because of you uh but still the the promotions i get from twitch like the

1451
02:20:38,500 --> 02:20:45,940
twitch prime loot boxes and all that stuff it's really great so i i don't want to miss that

1452
02:20:46,820 --> 02:20:53,220
so instead of like just paying for twitch prime i'll pay for amazon too and keep the

1453
02:20:53,940 --> 02:21:00,980
all the other stuff too so but i'll probably think twice before or ordering something on amazon at

1454
02:21:00,980 --> 02:21:08,180
least uh nintendo stuff and and reservations so yeah very interesting and i bet you know to be

1455
02:21:08,180 --> 02:21:14,260
fair uh amazon probably loves that answer that you know there's more than just the shipping

1456
02:21:14,260 --> 02:21:18,740
that's the kind of the value in being amazon prime you know at least in you know in their minds you

1457
02:21:18,740 --> 02:21:23,940
know and again you would have what like the amazon tv because you know we sometimes forget that oh

1458
02:21:23,940 --> 02:21:28,020
yeah amazon has a tv service as well where you know they've got their shows like transparent

1459
02:21:28,020 --> 02:21:32,740
does very well and you know some of their other stuff um and then uh you know that what they got

1460
02:21:32,740 --> 02:21:36,900
a music thing now too and stuff so this is all going to be justification for them to keep upping

1461
02:21:36,900 --> 02:21:43,140
the price i'm sure um let's see uh bobby blackwolf in chat says i wish twitch allowed the amazon

1462
02:21:43,140 --> 02:21:47,620
family accounts to use the twitch prime stuff even if it was only one per account i wish i

1463
02:21:47,620 --> 02:21:52,260
didn't have to tie my fiance's amazon prime account to my twitch to get the prime benefits

1464
02:21:52,260 --> 02:21:59,220
so well there's maybe uh you actually can because that's what uh my brother and i do that oh so you

1465
02:21:59,220 --> 02:22:06,900
actually can uh don't know if it's something on on the accounts or something that you have to change

1466
02:22:06,900 --> 02:22:14,020
oh bobby says not in the us oh well maybe that's that's the thing but uh yeah my brother and i can

1467
02:22:14,020 --> 02:22:19,780
and it's and it's different account so well rub it in why don't you i'm just kidding all right

1468
02:22:19,780 --> 02:22:23,060
here's another serious question before we let you go now that you have the super nintendo

1469
02:22:23,060 --> 02:22:30,500
classic in your hand what do you think it's it's really great i i i'm loving it so far even though

1470
02:22:30,500 --> 02:22:37,700
i haven't played that much uh because i got it yesterday basically uh but i'm loving it it's

1471
02:22:37,700 --> 02:22:45,940
really practical because even like last night uh i had a a party with some friends uh a friend of

1472
02:22:45,940 --> 02:22:54,580
mine uh had a birthday a celebration so since we're all gamers i i pretty much thought well

1473
02:22:54,580 --> 02:23:00,420
everybody wants to see the esnes classic so i'll take it and we all everybody had a blast

1474
02:23:00,420 --> 02:23:06,740
everybody wanted to play uh we played street fighter uh kirby's dream course he had lots of

1475
02:23:06,740 --> 02:23:13,300
fun and me personally i have uh and i haven't played it much uh that much sorry but i'm loving

1476
02:23:13,300 --> 02:23:19,220
it because of just only because of the games because the 21 games that are there are really

1477
02:23:19,220 --> 02:23:27,220
great even despite the star fox not being that uh not aging that well but aside from that it's

1478
02:23:27,220 --> 02:23:32,580
a really great machine and i even love it more than than the next classic despite the next

1479
02:23:32,580 --> 02:23:38,500
classic like having three games and having all those games also really great but don't know that

1480
02:23:38,500 --> 02:23:44,180
the next classic seems like a better value even well in the next year we get to do this all over

1481
02:23:44,180 --> 02:23:51,300
again for the game boy classic so just hold on yeah and i was actually gonna ask something about

1482
02:23:51,300 --> 02:23:57,780
uh and the relevance of that yeah sure because uh well the the anniversary for uh the third

1483
02:23:57,780 --> 02:24:06,580
anniversary is gonna be until uh 2019 but i was thinking about uh if if nintendo goes uh and makes

1484
02:24:07,380 --> 02:24:16,580
a gameboy mini would would just would you have rather have uh like an app on your phone or would

1485
02:24:16,580 --> 02:24:24,020
you rather see something like the switch that you can have a portable gameboy mini gameboy classic

1486
02:24:24,020 --> 02:24:30,900
and also hook it up to your tv oh good question i would like to see a simple hdmi out cable i

1487
02:24:30,900 --> 02:24:34,660
think could fix a lot of that um but then maybe you'd have to be able to plug in a controller

1488
02:24:34,660 --> 02:24:41,140
that could get a little dicey um um with like a port they have like portable nes emulators i

1489
02:24:41,140 --> 02:24:46,900
think yeah so i mean yeah something's anything's possible with that but um i would like to more

1490
02:24:46,900 --> 02:24:50,980
see a link cable i think that would be hilarious if you can actually connect two game boys together

1491
02:24:50,980 --> 02:24:55,140
with a link cable no i think that's something they might do especially so people can relive

1492
02:24:55,140 --> 02:24:59,460
the pokemon stuff but if they are going to do a gameboy classic and they put pokemon on it

1493
02:24:59,540 --> 02:25:05,300
they're gonna have to figure out a way to get these things in the pokemon bank so your idea

1494
02:25:05,300 --> 02:25:13,220
about it being able to talk to the switch somehow maybe through infrared maybe not too far off so

1495
02:25:13,220 --> 02:25:19,860
maybe not necessarily like link it to the switch but like having the switch port the tv doc have

1496
02:25:19,860 --> 02:25:26,900
it like uh uh like an output for tv so you can play like oh you can play gameboy uh games like

1497
02:25:26,900 --> 02:25:31,300
in the super game boy back in the day that'd be awesome but then again with this being nintendo

1498
02:25:31,300 --> 02:25:36,020
i'm not gonna hold my breath either or how about we just release the fucking virtual console

1499
02:25:36,900 --> 02:25:42,180
how about that we just released the virtual console for the switch don't talk crazy now

1500
02:25:42,180 --> 02:25:47,860
come on i know it's just so weird that you know i would expect them to put something that's been on

1501
02:25:47,860 --> 02:25:54,740
the last few systems on their current system they want us to all forget that we bought an nes classic

1502
02:25:54,740 --> 02:25:59,060
so that way when they release balloon fight yet again we're ready to buy it again that's

1503
02:25:59,060 --> 02:26:03,780
that's what we're waiting on here so yeah early next year probably all right act after i'm gonna

1504
02:26:03,780 --> 02:26:07,700
let you go to try to see if anyone else wants to get through but thank you and i'm i'm very happy

1505
02:26:07,700 --> 02:26:12,340
that this amazon story had a happy ending and thank you i think it's good that we follow up

1506
02:26:12,340 --> 02:26:17,220
on happy endings as well as negative endings so i appreciate the call hey thanks for having me

1507
02:26:17,220 --> 02:26:22,020
all right take care my friend have a good night you do all right one eight seven seven game olr

1508
02:26:22,020 --> 02:26:25,700
if you want to do it the old-fashioned way but orange lounge radio on skype is an even better

1509
02:26:25,700 --> 02:26:29,220
way because for a limited time it's the only way you get to see video here in the studio

1510
02:26:30,660 --> 02:26:35,140
or just it's really just me it's the ipad pointed at me because we're using an old ipad i can't

1511
02:26:35,140 --> 02:26:42,260
believe this is now an old ipad but it is it's it's ipad three or the new ipad or whatever they

1512
02:26:42,260 --> 02:26:47,380
called it at that time that's what we're running skype off of right now orange lounge radio all

1513
02:26:47,380 --> 02:26:50,980
one word on skype we'll just give it a few minutes to see if anybody wants to get through

1514
02:26:50,980 --> 02:26:54,900
but if not then we'll probably go ahead and wrap things up i'll check in one more time with my

1515
02:26:54,900 --> 02:27:00,740
co-host to see if there's any last minute excuse me last minute stories yeah yeah with the latest

1516
02:27:00,740 --> 02:27:07,060
trend that we've been seeing uh with people coming to twitter and stuff to report sexual abuse and

1517
02:27:07,060 --> 02:27:13,140
scandals of course there's a few ties with the gaming industry um there was i think was the

1518
02:27:13,140 --> 02:27:17,220
gaming grumps or something like that there was a whole issue with that but now we've got someone

1519
02:27:17,460 --> 02:27:22,020
heard that yeah there was one i don't remember it was some group i think it was the game grumps it

1520
02:27:22,020 --> 02:27:26,580
may have been i could be wrong i heard only read the story once but it was like the head happens

1521
02:27:26,580 --> 02:27:32,660
that's the head thing to get wrong so right yeah so don't take my word for it um anyways so there

1522
02:27:32,660 --> 02:27:38,900
was a guy by the name of david ballard who was an environmental and multi or very mental and

1523
02:27:38,900 --> 02:27:45,060
multiplayer level artist for uncharted two through four and last of us apparently he uh with the

1524
02:27:45,060 --> 02:27:50,660
twitter talking about some sexual harassment that he received at from his workplace so he said in

1525
02:27:50,660 --> 02:27:55,780
late 2015 i was sexually harassed the naughty dog by a lead my work environment became extremely

1526
02:27:55,780 --> 02:28:01,300
toxic afterward in february 2016 i had a mental breakdown at work and suddenly playstation hr

1527
02:28:01,300 --> 02:28:05,620
became involved well i told him about the harassment the end of the call and fired me

1528
02:28:05,620 --> 02:28:09,860
the next day they decided the company was moving in a different direction and my job was no longer

1529
02:28:09,860 --> 02:28:13,380
needed they tried to silence me by offering me twenty thousand dollars if i signed a letter

1530
02:28:13,380 --> 02:28:17,940
agreeing to the termination as well as not to disclose it with anyone else i declined to sign

1531
02:28:17,940 --> 02:28:23,380
i've been unemployed for 17 months since this is when the interviewers um asked why i left

1532
02:28:23,380 --> 02:28:27,700
naughty dog i said i was burned out by the crunch ashamed to get to the root of the problem of being

1533
02:28:27,700 --> 02:28:32,740
sexually harassed i'm speaking out now because of the strength of i've seen others come forward

1534
02:28:32,740 --> 02:28:37,860
about their experiences in tv film industry it's the hardest thing i've ever had i've ever done in

1535
02:28:37,860 --> 02:28:43,460
laywin uh kill my drive or love for video game industry and my passion for life and then of

1536
02:28:43,460 --> 02:28:48,740
course they naughty dog released the statement as well as we've been recently uh we have recently

1537
02:28:48,740 --> 02:28:53,140
read on social media the next employee of naughty dog dave allard claims he was sexually harassed

1538
02:28:53,140 --> 02:28:58,020
when he worked at naughty dog we have not found any evidence of having received allegations from

1539
02:28:58,020 --> 02:29:02,580
mr ballard as he was harassed in any way of naughty dog or sony or active entertainment

1540
02:29:02,580 --> 02:29:06,900
harassment inappropriate conduct have no place at naughty dog or sony interactive entertainment

1541
02:29:06,900 --> 02:29:12,420
we have taken and always will report sexual harassment and other workplace grievances very

1542
02:29:12,420 --> 02:29:21,460
seriously and blah blah blah so so i don't i don't know where to go without getting too soapboxy with

1543
02:29:21,460 --> 02:29:26,580
this whole thing but it's very obvious that i think there's been a lot of dark shit that's

1544
02:29:26,580 --> 02:29:31,220
happened out there and finally people are putting their fucking foot down and saying we're not going

1545
02:29:31,220 --> 02:29:37,700
to fucking take this anymore and even the once thought impenetrable hollywood dark stories of

1546
02:29:37,700 --> 02:29:42,900
casting couches and things like that you know finally people are saying we are sick of this

1547
02:29:42,900 --> 02:29:47,380
shit period and it's just a sad reminder that everything you're seeing happening in hollywood

1548
02:29:47,380 --> 02:29:53,220
right now it's not unique to hollywood it happens pretty much in every industry and it needs to stop

1549
02:29:53,220 --> 02:29:59,380
and some shithole guy who was like a lawyer in the industry was going out saying well now we're

1550
02:29:59,380 --> 02:30:03,780
gonna hear nothing but this in the future like it's a bad thing that it's coming out to light

1551
02:30:03,780 --> 02:30:08,900
how long is have a lot of people probably repress this exactly well right now on facebook there

1552
02:30:08,900 --> 02:30:12,900
actually is the people posting me too it's happening on twitter it's happening everywhere

1553
02:30:12,900 --> 02:30:19,300
yeah people need to fucking see it it happens a lot more than you think it is and it needs to stop

1554
02:30:19,300 --> 02:30:26,580
and people that you'll never be a part of it and never judge anybody by what they wear no one is

1555
02:30:26,580 --> 02:30:34,900
ever fucking asking for it it's just disgusting i'm nothing is consent except consent exactly

1556
02:30:34,900 --> 02:30:43,460
and lack of an answer is not consent so anyway all right a good uh a good uh lesson to end the show

1557
02:30:43,460 --> 02:30:49,060
on tonight but uh you know we i know we say uh game industry needs to do better here's an example

1558
02:30:49,060 --> 02:30:53,780
and i realize it's a dicey situation there's you know his story a naughty dog story and so forth

1559
02:30:53,780 --> 02:31:00,900
but you know what um it's probably this is probably one unfortunately unfortunately of

1560
02:31:00,900 --> 02:31:06,660
many stories that are out there and um people need to do better and be better people and not

1561
02:31:06,660 --> 02:31:13,380
prey on um other people yeah i was unable to find out which site that was there was a pretty major

1562
02:31:13,380 --> 02:31:21,220
site i just don't remember i may be remembering who it was yeah correctly i saw it like i can't

1563
02:31:21,220 --> 02:31:27,940
i can't find it so we'll presume everyone to be innocent for now all right well since our

1564
02:31:27,940 --> 02:31:31,780
skype line is not lighting up with any more calls i'm going to assume that is it for the calls

1565
02:31:31,780 --> 02:31:36,500
tonight and i think it's about time we go ahead and we wrap things up here at orange launch radio

1587
02:33:30,100 --> 02:33:38,100
a guy named andy sigmar uh signor was the accused of it apparently um there's a woman by the name

1588

that came out and talked about it um saying that you know uh and apparently a lot more people i

1589
02:33:44,340 --> 02:33:49,780
think came out about it as well showing the new texts about how they were um he was sexually

1590
02:33:49,780 --> 02:33:57,620

1591
02:33:57,620 --> 02:34:04,820
they're looking at screen junkies and defy media they're looking into it but he's been um i think
