Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki!

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Tonight, on the eve of Super Mario Odyssey's release, Nintendo Switch gets new sharing features.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Soon, you can send videos of Mario and his new amiibo bridal gown to Twitter and Facebook.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
All this and much more tonight on the show where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight, episode number 705 of our show for this October the 22nd, 2017.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,000
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you here over the next few hours to talk about video games with my pals, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I don't know. I think I am equally in love with both Jason's and YYR's voices.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Yes.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Their voices are just so nice.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Yes. Big shout out to YYR who did some pinch hitting on the announce tonight. Jason's at TwitchCon.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Jason would be like Mr. Movie Phone or one of those movie announcers.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And then YYR would be like the guys I hear on NHK International who do like the bento show that I watch on NHK TV.

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So do some Japanese documentaries for us please.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Or maybe the two of them should start a podcast. Wink Nudge. Maybe. Maybe that's an idea.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Voices.

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Voices.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Voices of geeks.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Voices of geeks.

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I don't think that name's taken. Alright.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Say hello as well to another geek voice over there. Techmaster Loki.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Hello.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Hi Loki. How are you?

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Fine.

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yeah?

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You sound kind of nervous. You alright?

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I am perfectly fine.

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Okay. That's good. That's good. How was your week?

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It was alright. I don't know. It's uneventful. Lots of Legos. But uneventful.

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Good. Yeah. I was at the mall yesterday. I was at the Lego store and I thought of you.

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So, cause I was like oh it's Matt's favorite store.

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Yeah. I really should have never gone into that Lego store the first time. Like I knew.

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Stepping in there. God damn it. This is gonna be my life now.

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I was actually there this weekend too. Picking up some parts. Cause my kids are so wonderful.

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So they break and crack and lose pieces from my sets. And it's usually, it's not necessarily my sets.

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's the stuff I buy for them. And they're like oh it's missing. I'm like okay. I gotta go buy the replacement parts.

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So thankfully there's an independent store nearby that they sell used Legos.

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And so you just kind of sift through their bin to find what you're looking for.

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So it cost me like two cents to replace the stuff. I'm like okay. Can't beat that.

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Alright. Nice.

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
But they're doing birthday parties starting this week.

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Woohoo. Birthday parties. More Legos.

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And babysit kids and stuff. I'm like yes.

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Alright. I also have to introduce here our old friend of the show is joining us tonight.

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Sadly because of the mic issues we've had in studio recently I can't get him his own mic.

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So we won't really hear from him a lot more till later. Cause Jamie's gonna only be here for half the show tonight.

49
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Cause she has other things to tend to. But filling in a little later tonight and maybe a little bit at the top here too.

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Say hi to JD is back.

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Hey.

52
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And how are you doing? What's new with you? What kind of like. I'll ask your gaming week later on.

53
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
But in a nutshell like how's gaming been treating you?

54
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Pretty good. I've been enjoying my Switch a lot.

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Oh that's right. Cause for a while you kind of skipped like a whole generation of consoles right.

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
But now you're like back in it with the Switch right?

57
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Yeah I mean like I bought a Wii U in January and that was the first it had for like since I bought a Wii.

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
But yeah I got Switch at launch and I've just been really enjoying it.

59
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Nice. What are like your top two games on Switch right now?

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Right now. Splatoon and I guess I've been playing a lot of Konga Master Party.

61
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Oh yeah yeah yeah. We were. You made me play that a little while ago. It was fun.

62
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'll ask you more about that during your gaming weeks. But I am here in a minute.

63
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm going to get to. Actually we're going to talk to one of our pals. A friend of the show here at OLR.

64
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
We're going to talk to a user on Twitch named Fun John. Cause he's fun.

65
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
We're going to talk to him because he is at Twitch Con. Or was at Twitch Con cause Twitch Con is winding down.

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm going to call him here shortly. I do want to do one quick housekeeping thing though.

67
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I kind of just want to get this out of the way because it's kind of a downer slash negative.

68
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:34,000
But I have to get it off my chest because at the end of last week's show I referenced something about that Alan and I's cat wasn't doing so well.

69
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I just did want to let you guys know we did unfortunately have to make the difficult choice to have her put to sleep on Monday.

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Because she had a condition she was not going to recover from.

71
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And the vet let us know that it was really really best for her well-being you know because she was in pain.

72
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So after 17 and a half years with Sanrio we did have to make that difficult call this week.

73
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So I just want to let you guys know that and update you on that.

74
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And thank Jamie for being a part of Sanrio's life as well.

75
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Cause every time Alan and I were out of town you were a very reliable substitute female influence on her life.

76
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm a cat auntie.

77
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yes cat auntie.

78
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Well and she actually let me give her scritches for like half a second before she you know waddled out away.

79
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Yeah she usually hated people so I always said don't take it personally she just always runs and hides.

80
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It takes her a good year to get to know people.

81
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I found a video that I took one time when I was cat sitting that I think I forwarded to Alan.

82
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
But I have a couple of videos of her that I will make sure that you guys get.

83
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Okay. Alright so again not to be too much of a downer but I do want to let you guys know that.

84
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So let's go ahead and talk about video games. Get back into gaming.

85
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
And I know one thing exciting that happened this week was TwitchCon.

86
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So we're going to actually try to get a hold of our pal who is at the TwitchCon event.

87
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Cause sadly I didn't go to TwitchCon this year.

88
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I went to TwitchCon I think it was the first year they did it.

89
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I went to TwitchCon when it was in San Francisco.

90
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
But this year sadly I didn't get to go but I wanted to check in and see how the event is going.

91
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
So I believe on the line we have from Twitch our pal Fun John.

92
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
John you there?

93
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Hey how you doing?

94
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Hey I am great John. Thanks for coming on the show last minute.

95
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Yeah no worries.

96
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So you're down there at TwitchCon right? Or is it over?

97
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It officially wraps in about 45-50 minutes.

98
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm actually across the street from the convention center. They're doing the closing right now.

99
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Gotcha. Well sorry to pull you away from that.

100
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
No worries. I think I'm done with standing on my feet and standing in line this weekend.

101
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
So I think I'm going to find some place to sit down.

102
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Is it LineCon there? Is it lots and lots of standing in line like some cons are?

103
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Unfortunately this year the theme has definitely been hashtag LineCon 2017.

104
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's really unfortunate.

105
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Uh oh. Okay let me ask you actually quickly this question.

106
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Are you more a streamer on Twitch or are you more a viewer on Twitch?

107
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Like what was your motivation for going to TwitchCon?

108
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm a little bit of both. I'm a very occasional streamer.

109
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm trying to get more into it. I do a lot of watching people on Twitch.

110
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I watch you. I watch some of the friends that I'm with here.

111
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I watch some of the larger private streamers.

112
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:15,000
But I do stream occasionally. Mostly I try to stream to get some support for charity events like Extra Life and St. Jude and stuff like that.

113
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Nice. Those are very worthy causes and I think make the whole streaming thing a lot cooler.

114
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Did you find TwitchCon to be motivating?

115
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Because I know the first year I was...

116
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I probably am streaming on Twitch now because I went to TwitchCon that first year.

117
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Yeah I really enjoyed it this year and I did find it motivating.

118
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
There's a lot of networking opportunities. There's a lot of opportunities to see what new games are coming out.

119
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
What companies are interested in making the streaming experience better.

120
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
There's streaming software, hardware vendors. Intel had a big booth there.

121
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
They were giving stuff away and they're also lauding the newer chips aimed towards gaming and streaming.

122
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So I really think it was useful and it's definitely motivating.

123
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,000
They always have the charity corner where they have all the charities and the major organizations that are trying to raise money.

124
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
And they encourage people to use Twitch to help them do that.

125
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,000
And I personally enjoy going and talking to all of them and finding new opportunities where I can help out.

126
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
That is awesome. Since it is a gaming show and this is a gaming convention,

127
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
was there a lot of actual playable games there on the show floor?

128
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Or was it more, these are more tools?

129
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:34,000
There are. There was a very large, well first of all there was the entire H1Z1 arena.

130
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:42,000
The big arena ball part of the convention center was just for the amateur and professional H1Z1 competitions the entire weekend.

131
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:51,000
There was a 40 seat player unknown battleground competition arena set up with HP and Omen.

132
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
They were doing the Omen challenge and they would let you, if you got in early enough in the morning,

133
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
you could sign up to play one of the tournaments.

134
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
They were doing 40 person duo tournaments for prizes.

135
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,000
But then there's also the smaller game companies, even the indie developers.

136
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
And they had lots of booth space out in the expo floor where you could play their games,

137
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
you could see demos, you could get codes for finished versions.

138
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And it was even bigger than it was last year and I really like that too.

139
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Were you able to attend many of the panels?

140
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I know a lot of it was streaming out on the internet so we could all see it,

141
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
but did you go to any of the panels in person? What did you think?

142
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Sadly, I did not make as many of the panels as I had intended.

143
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
There were a couple that I was super interested in,

144
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
but the ones I was really interested in were the ones that were happening first in the day.

145
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
And unfortunately, the entrance line was the one that got us most of the time.

146
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Ah, I see. Oh, so it was slow just to get into the building?

147
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So there's the east side entrance and the west side entrance.

148
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Let's see, the west side entrance is where I am now and that was the short line,

149
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
but everybody was going to the east side entrance because that's where they picked up badges

150
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
and that's where everybody said, oh, go in on that side.

151
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Yesterday it took me 45 or 50 minutes to get into the building at about 12 o'clock when it opened.

152
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
There were people who got here to the convention center at 8 a.m.

153
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
so that they could try to get into the Player Unknowns tournament.

154
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
They had to get here that early so they could be at the front of the line

155
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
and then race across the building to sign up.

156
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I wonder if that's an issue that's going to need –

157
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
well, they seem to change venues every year,

158
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
so I wonder if that's going to be unique to that venue or if that's something you'll have to –

159
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Yeah, I think the reason they change venues is size.

160
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
And I was wondering this myself.

161
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
The first year that I didn't go to was in San Francisco

162
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
because I didn't find out about it until about a month after it happened.

163
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And last year I went down to San Diego and they had about half of the San Diego Convention Center.

164
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
This year they have the entire Long Beach Convention Center,

165
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
which is probably bigger than the one in San Diego.

166
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
So it has definitely grown in size.

167
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
If they stay here, they're definitely going to have to work through the resource management

168
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,000
and how fast they can get people in and out because the lines were just atrociously long.

169
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It's definitely – I know they're going to invite people to provide feedback

170
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
after they get home and have a few days to think on it and stuff,

171
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
and I've got a list of some of the feedback I want to provide.

172
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
The top of it is those super long lines were just chilling the fun.

173
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And not to say I had a lot of fun,

174
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
but it would have been a lot more fun if I hadn't had to stand in line so much.

175
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Sure.

176
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Now, those types of, like, methods of running a convention aside,

177
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
what would you like to most see at a TwitchCon 2018 that wasn't there this year?

178
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Sorry, I didn't read. What was that?

179
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Outside of those types of, like, the business of running things, sorts of things,

180
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
what would you most like to see at a TwitchCon 2018 that wasn't there this year?

181
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I would really like to see – well, I'm not sure how much bigger it could get,

182
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
but I would really love to have seen the charity plaza be even bigger.

183
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It was about the same size as it was last year.

184
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I would kind of like to see Twitch –

185
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I mean, you know, every year they add new features,

186
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
and a big part of TwitchCon is saying, okay, these are the features that are coming.

187
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
One of the things I would really like to see them do is double down on some of the charity and community efforts

188
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
and say, you know, not only are we adding these cool features for you,

189
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
but we're also doing these things to make it easier for people to raise money

190
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
or make it easier for people to host these kind of events that are, you know,

191
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
maybe not everybody – you know, obviously not everybody's on Twitch to raise money and do community work,

192
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
but there are those of us that feel very strongly about, you know, I want to raise money for Extra Life

193
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
because I personally benefited from a children's hospital when I was a kid,

194
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
and I want to pay that one forward.

195
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
You know, I'd really love to see Twitch do something, and obviously I don't know exactly what that would be,

196
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
but I'd love to see them do something, you know, make the impact bigger, you know,

197
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
make more space, find other ways to incentivize it.

198
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
You know, playable games is a really big thing here.

199
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I know a lot of people come out here for playable games, and there's a ton of that.

200
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
People come out here to collect t-shirts and giveaways, and there's a lot of that.

201
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
So, I mean, you know, making those bigger just needs a bigger space,

202
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
but honestly I think one of the things I personally would like to see is them incentivizing

203
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,000
some of the non-traditional uses of Twitch just to keep it growing and becoming fresh everywhere else.

204
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I think that is really good feedback. I hope Twitch actually listens to this.

205
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I do want to acknowledge the chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

206
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
because I haven't given them a shout out yet tonight,

207
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
and they're putting up with some of our live chatters.

208
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I don't know what's going on. We're having weird bandwidth issues tonight,

209
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
which I don't think is on our end because the Skype call is holding,

210
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
and Alan is in the back playing Overwatch, as he usually does during the show,

211
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
and those things are holding fine, but unfortunately we keep hiccuping on the live stream.

212
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
So thank you to the live listeners for putting up with that crap tonight.

213
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I don't know what's going on, but I do want to say over in our chat at live.vognetwork.com,

214
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Bobby is saying, I think it's interesting to have a convention like TwitchCon

215
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
where technically everyone is media, and Kaijuto follows that up with,

216
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
so does the media interview themselves at TwitchCon? That would be funny to watch.

217
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Well, let me ask you this, Jon.

218
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Are you meeting people there that you've only seen online,

219
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
and how is that experience of meeting people IRL?

220
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Are they what you expect, or are they different, or what?

221
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It totally is a lot of meeting people for the very first time.

222
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I've been hanging around with a group of four or five people, and of them,

223
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
only one I had met in person before, and that was last year at TwitchCon in San Diego.

224
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
And that comment about, is the media interviewing themselves, it totally is.

225
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
On average, you would see 50 to 60 people at a time walking around the expo floor

226
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
live streaming on selfie sticks.

227
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
And of course, there were bandwidth issues in the convention center,

228
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
but if you had bandwidth, there were people doing it the entire weekend.

229
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
There were people live streaming expo floor, merch floor, all around the building.

230
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Just even around town Thursday night before the convention even started,

231
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
we were at a bar hanging out with some friends, having dinner,

232
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
and three of the people there, three out of the 13 people there were live streaming.

233
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
They're followers.

234
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Hanging out with their, bringing their followers to Long Beach,

235
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
the ones that couldn't actually make it here, and I think that's really awesome.

236
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
That is so neat.

237
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
That's just so interesting, that kind of world that we live in,

238
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
where everybody is streaming the same thing from three different points of view,

239
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
because that's the kind of convention it is.

240
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
That's so hilarious.

241
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I do want to let you go here pretty soon so you can get back to the festivities,

242
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
but I want to end on a positive note, so let me ask this.

243
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
What was your favorite thing about TwitchCon this year?

244
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
You know, a lot of people have been asking me what brings you to TwitchCon,

245
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
and I've done a lot of thinking about that, and it really is a positive thing.

246
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
The positive thing is these people are my family.

247
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
They are part of my family.

248
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
You're part of my family because I've known you for several years,

249
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
and all the people that run in those circles, they're part of my family.

250
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
These people are my family too.

251
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
These are people that I hang out with when I'm working or I'm playing

252
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:01,000
and we're talking, and we share joys, we share griefs, we help each other out,

253
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
and I think the best part, honestly, the best part was that Friday was my birthday,

254
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
and coming to TwitchCon on my birthday was great,

255
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
and hanging out with all these different communities and people singing

256
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
and happy birthday to me and getting all the hugs.

257
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
All the lines of the world cannot destroy all the love and support I've gotten

258
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
from all these people that I call my friends and family this weekend,

259
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
and it's been overwhelming and amazing, and I'm going to be really sad

260
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
when I go home, and I can't wait until next year to do it again.

261
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Well, Jon, I think next year I'm really going to try to join you.

262
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Hopefully they have it in a place that's easy for me to get to,

263
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
but since I had to cut something from earlier in the year,

264
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
one of my conventions I can't go to next year because of time,

265
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
it looks more likely I'll be able to do TwitchCon next year,

266
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
so I'm really looking forward to it, and I think that is a fantastic note to end this on.

267
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Jon, thank you for taking time out during the convention to be here.

268
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
If you all want to follow Jon over on Twitch, keep tabs of his charity events

269
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
and some of the awesome people he follows, that's Fun Jon, F-U-N-J-O-N, am I correct?

270
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Yeah, that's correct.

271
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
All right, anything else you want to plug while you're here?

272
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Not really. I just thank you very much for the opportunity, and you have a great day.

273
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
You are welcome. Happy belated birthday from all of us here at OLR,

274
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
and send our love from OLR and VoG to all the peeps at TwitchCon.

275
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Thanks, will do.

276
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
All right, take care, buddy.

277
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Yep, bye-bye.

278
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Bye.

279
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Thanks again to Jon for taking time out of his TwitchCon to join us here.

280
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I love that whole there's 13 people at dinner and three of them are livestreaming it,

281
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
but that is something that's kind of probably unique,

282
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
and I see Bobby in chat over at live.vognetwork.com talking about,

283
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
to be fair, Rob and I both get interviewed by other podcasters at DragonCon.

284
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
That's true, so there is a little bit of that, but it's not always livestreamed.

285
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I guess the podcasting panels are livestreamed, but that's kind of different.

286
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
That's very different than dinner, but I'm totally not knocking it.

287
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I just think it's a very interesting part of our culture and the world that we do that,

288
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:01,000
and that, like Jon says, the people who wish they could be there but can't be

289
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
really get to be a part of that experience.

290
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
And it almost makes me wonder, I know bandwidth is awful there,

291
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
but should we try to be livestreaming more of DragonCon somehow?

292
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I don't know, but I know the cell phone networks all show up there.

293
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Bring the hotspots.

294
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
That's right, right, or whatever we can do to get on those networks.

295
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Anyway, thanks again, Jon, for taking the time out.

296
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I do want to mention some of the things that Twitch did announce

297
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
as part of TwitchCon that I thought was really cool.

298
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
They did announce that they would be launching some new features,

299
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
including a stream summary, so once you're done with a stream, you can see,

300
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
like, did you get clipped, how many people watched it, all that stuff.

301
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
They're doing this thing called Premieres,

302
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
where they want to have organized first viewing events

303
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
to generate anticipation around viewership of new videos.

304
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
And that's probably more for people who do videos than it can,

305
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
like maybe YouTubers.

306
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
It's probably to attract some of the YouTubers to debut stuff live

307
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
and kind of get that reaction.

308
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
At least that's kind of what I'm getting out of it.

309
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
But I know people like a buddy of mine who was on this show

310
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
probably a year or two ago talking about some of his projects,

311
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Matt Baum, who does a very popular podcast called Sewers of Paris.

312
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
And I know he's done some of these, like, he not only does Twitch,

313
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
but he does, like, the Dungeons and Drag Queens

314
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
and some of that stuff that he does.

315
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Like, when I hear this, I think of, like, Matt,

316
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
and this would be a great platform for someone like him

317
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
who kind of dabbles in both to get to do that.

318
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
He also does, like, story time where he, like, reads a book and stuff like that.

319
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
It's a lot of fun.

320
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Yeah, yeah. So, you know, people are using Twitch in very, very creative ways.

321
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Let's see. And also they're talking about doing raids.

322
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
So you can actually use a slash raid to raid another channel.

323
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
And actually this kind of happened to me a couple weeks ago.

324
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
So I was doing an OLR post stream, as I usually do.

325
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I did the Cuphead. It was that night.

326
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
So towards the end of my stream, I was like,

327
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
okay, this is the last time I'm going to run this level.

328
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Somebody did a host with 83 viewers on my stream.

329
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
And I don't usually get that many viewers on my stream

330
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
because I'm still, you know, I don't stream enough

331
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
to have a huge following on there.

332
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
But, like, that was like, wow, oh my.

333
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
And it actually kind of made me go, well, shit, I can't quit now.

334
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
So I, like, kind of pushed myself to go for at least 10 more minutes.

335
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
And then I think I was able to take, like, a good 30 or 40 whoever was left

336
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
and then I passed them to Flaco when I was done for the night.

337
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
So it was kind of, you know, a nice little share the viewers

338
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
and pass them off to your friends.

339
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
They are talking about doing rooms,

340
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
which is something about separate spaces within your chat.

341
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
That's probably going to be better for people that have a larger audience than I do.

342
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Rituals, which, like, is, like, say somebody is coming to your channel for the first time,

343
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
you can actually, like, if you signal that this person is new,

344
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
then there's, like, I don't know, like, a ritual where Twitch will break the ice in chat.

345
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I kind of want to hear more about what that all is.

346
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Something else I think is very interesting, achievements.

347
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
So they're going to actually put an achievement system within Twitch.

348
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
But unlike, you know, Xbox or PlayStation where, you know,

349
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
we add them up and the points don't matter type of thing,

350
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
these achievements are showing you have you unlocked affiliate status yet

351
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
or have you unlocked partner status.

352
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
That's kind of a neat way to do that, so kind of cute.

353
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
And then also gifting subscriptions because why not?

354
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
That means more money for said affiliates and partners, easier way to do that

355
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,000
and more ability to, you know, pass along a little coin to some of your favorite Twitch people.

356
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
So that's all the stuff they announced there.

357
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
And I know I'm focusing on Twitch and I'm not really saying as much about YouTube and Mixer

358
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
because, well, Twitch had the con, the other two didn't.

359
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
But where one company tends to go, others seem to follow.

360
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Let me open it up here in studio and just kind of ask, you know,

361
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
what do you guys think about Twitch and where it's going

362
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
and some of this stuff we're hearing, having heard from the con?

363
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Logie?

364
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I don't know. I mean, I don't know why I would go to this.

365
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I mean, other than I guess if I was really big fans of like some of the streamers or maybe.

366
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I mean, I'm not really sure what this is even.

367
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I think for me when I, you know, I was exactly like you that first year I went

368
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
when Jason was like, dude, I have an extra ticket and it's a two hour drive, you're coming.

369
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
And I was like, okay, yes, I'm going.

370
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
And when I went, I was like, oh, maybe if I thought of this more as a trade show,

371
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I probably would have got it because when I got there, it was like, oh,

372
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I'm actually seeing new streaming technology.

373
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
And oh, like here's a video card for sale that I actually bought at TwitchCon

374
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
that I actually use to stream on Twitch now.

375
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
And then, you know, I saw some new stuff that was going to go to Kickstarter,

376
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
but like ways to like, I think it was like a remote control,

377
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
like switch camera angles from like an iPad or something.

378
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I don't remember what it was, but like, you know, it was kind of like,

379
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
and like John said on the call, you meet different charities

380
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
because more and more charities are embracing streaming.

381
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I think we all know about Extra Life and Extra Life does a very good job

382
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
putting their name out there and so forth,

383
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
but other charities are seeing what Extra Life is doing and going,

384
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
hey, we want people to fundraise for us too, you know,

385
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
and people can kind of go find those causes that really speak to them.

386
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
So I think that's kind of what you also get out of it

387
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
is you get a lot of ideas for how to make your stream better.

388
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
And it's like-minded individuals who are doing the same thing.

389
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I guess.

390
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Yeah.

391
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Well, I think it's interesting.

392
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Let's see.

393
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
SSJ100Matt suggests that the ritual is Rocky Horror style hazing

394
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
in Twitch for first timers.

395
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I like that idea.

396
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Can I draw a V on someone in lipstick who comes into my chat

397
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
for the first time?

398
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
That'd be fantastic.

399
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I love it.

400
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Dark Soccer, are you going to have a ritual for your Twitch channel?

401
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
You must accept Garris as your savior.

402
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Be like, why aren't you bitches saying anything?

403
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I can't chat at you if you don't give me anything to chat with.

404
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Love it.

405
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
All right.

406
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
So thanks again, John, for coming on the show and talking about TwitchCon

407
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
and congrats on Twitch for a successful, what is this, third year, fourth year?

408
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I think I lost count.

409
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I think it's the third year at TwitchCon.

410
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
So, yeah.

411
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
All right.

412
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Awesome.

413
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Well, we're going to get into our gaming weeks.

414
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Actually, I will humor the chat with a question here

415
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
because we do tape live again at the Voice Geeks Network

416
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern,

417
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
right after The Bobby Black Wolf Show.

418
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,000
And you can ask us questions in chat just like William 2DS XL Face is asking,

419
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
saying, Rob, Jamie, and Loki,

420
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
what do you think of the recent acquisition of Humble by IGN?

421
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
So we got into this a little bit last week.

422
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I think Jamie brought the story.

423
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I saw there was a follow-up.

424
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I didn't put it on the list for tonight just because there was a bunch of other stories.

425
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
But let me check in.

426
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:35,000
How are you guys feeling one week later about the Humble and IGN acquisition?

427
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Indifferent?

428
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I mean, I don't know.

429
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I don't like IGN.

430
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I think they're dirty.

431
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,000
But I don't even know who they're owned by anymore because I don't know.

432
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
So really, I'm not worried about it until I need to be worried about it.

433
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Jamie, your thoughts?

434
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I don't have any reason to be worried yet.

435
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
So we just have to wait and see what happens.

436
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I mean, it's so soon we don't know what they're going to do.

437
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Right.

438
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I'm waiting.

439
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I'm cautiously optimistic to see what the changes are going to be.

440
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
And I'm cautiously optimistic maybe there will be no changes,

441
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
save for banner advertising for IGN at the top and bottom,

442
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
or maybe the links to the different games instead of going to YouTube.

443
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
There are going to be IGN videos about the games.

444
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Those types of things I expect.

445
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
And at the end of the day, if I can still get games,

446
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
great games for a great value and decide where my money goes

447
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,000
and know that the vast majority of that money will go to the charity

448
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
and the developers, which is usually how I tend to split my money,

449
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
then I'll be fine with it.

450
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,000
But as I don't want IGN to try to make money off of this site,

451
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
that would be where I would kind of draw the line.

452
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
But I do expect that IGN will integrate their own resources

453
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
where it's appropriate to do so.

454
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
And I think y'all need to be ready for that.

455
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:05,000
So like I said, instead of YouTube's or instead of these high-rated games,

456
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:12,000
it's going to be an click here on IGN to read our 7.6 too much water out of 10 review.

457
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:18,000
The only thing, and this is such a minor thing that I would be kind of wary on,

458
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,000
is Humble is technically a publisher of independent games.

459
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
So they do have some games, like A Hat in Time, that they actually do publish.

460
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
These games are going to be reviewed by IGN,

461
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
and it's kind of hard to see that as not biased in a way.

462
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I mean, that's the only thing, but that's such a minor thing.

463
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
It's like I don't even really think about it, but I don't know.

464
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I just don't like them.

465
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I mean, I'm sorry.

466
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
That's like saying if Fox News bought Humble Bundle or something like that,

467
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
it's like, eh, I just feel dirty.

468
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I mean, that's kind of how I feel with IGN.

469
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
IGN, it's not even I don't like them.

470
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I don't even think about them anymore.

471
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Honestly, I don't visit their site anymore.

472
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I used to visit it all the time.

473
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
You can't spell ignore without I-G-N-N.

474
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I just, I don't know.

475
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
It's just not...

476
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
We're ignorant.

477
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
There are sites, though, that we've hated on

478
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
and that eventually come back to being fine again, like Kotaku.

479
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Kotaku, sure.

480
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Perfect example.

481
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
So who knows?

482
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I mean, right now, like I said, until there's some major changes that...

483
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
The people at, I mean, not to get too shady,

484
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
but since y'all got me started, we're just amongst friends, right?

485
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Since Kotaku, all the people that were a problem there

486
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
went and started a new website.

487
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,000
So what was left was people that made a pretty decent website.

488
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
So like, right now, I don't have to worry about it.

489
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
And they're not the only site that sells bundles.

490
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
There's like at least a few sites that do that.

491
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
So I'm not really worried.

492
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
And honestly, a lot of the bundles that they have nowadays,

493
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I own most of the stuff in them.

494
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
So it's not something that I'm really looking at.

495
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I do hope that they do more console bundles because those I do like.

496
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Do you think maybe on that side,

497
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
and Jamie, I want to check on your thoughts, too,

498
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
but let me just do one question.

499
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Do you think maybe the flip side of IGN's weight or something

500
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
is that maybe they'll have more leverage to do more 3DS?

501
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
They probably have more experienced marketing teams

502
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
that can sell that idea to some of these publishers.

503
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
That makes sense to me.

504
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
What about your thoughts, Jamie?

505
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Honestly, I just agree with that.

506
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I mean, it's what I just said.

507
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
That sounds like what they're doing.

508
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Yeah.

509
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Fair enough.

510
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Like I said, until we have something to worry about,

511
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I'm not going to worry about it.

512
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
All right.

513
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
There you go.

514
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Answer your question live on chat over at live.vog.

515
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Que sera, sera.

516
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
That's right.

517
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Let's talk about our gaming weeks

518
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
and the types of video games that you have been playing this week.

519
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Ladies first, Dark Soccer.

520
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
How was your gaming week?

521
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
We were wrapping up the convention guide, which is funny.

522
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
I have another edit to do when I get home, but that's okay.

523
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
So really not a whole lot.

524
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I've been playing idle pouring.

525
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I haven't really touched RO because, like I said,

526
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
my time has been taken up by the con guide.

527
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
You know, Pokemon Go.

528
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I'm using that for my walking.

529
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Miitomo a little bit.

530
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Does that count as a game?

531
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Ish.

532
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Miitomo Drop is a game, I guess.

533
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Yeah, that's true.

534
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
So I've been fairly good at that.

535
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I actually like the costumes that they have out right now.

536
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
They have like the Nintendo Gakuen outfit.

537
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
So like cute little school uniforms.

538
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
So Miitomo is still being regularly updated.

539
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Yeah.

540
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Oh yeah.

541
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
To be fair, I'm not trying to be mean,

542
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
but I kind of forget Miitomo is a thing until you bring it up on the show.

543
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
That's my honest answer.

544
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I kind of forget it's a thing and then you bring it up.

545
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I'm like, oh yeah, I should like load that.

546
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I actually went back and started playing,

547
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
trying to get through R-Type again on my iPhone.

548
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
It's just really difficult on there.

549
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I mean, the version of R-Type is really good.

550
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
So I've been sort of digging around for other Irem games,

551
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,000
just to, I guess, kind of branch out from R-Type,

552
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
because really R-Type is the biggest Irem game I did much playing on.

553
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
So that's about it.

554
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
All right.

555
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Let me head over to Loki and check in.

556
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
How was your gaming week?

557
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Just more of the office space idle clicker game.

558
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I actually have been playing a little bit of Pokemon Go

559
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
because they have that new event that's going on.

560
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
So I need more Ghost-type Pokemon, so I figured I'd do that.

561
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Didn't play too much in the console games.

562
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Just too lazy to actually set up my PlayStation to do PlayStation VR.

563
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I did buy more PlayStation VR games,

564
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
so I have literally a plethora of games to play.

565
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
So one of them was, what was it called?

566
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
It's Megaton Rainfall, which is kind of like,

567
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
it's like an arcade shooter game.

568
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I'm not sure about the controls on it,

569
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
but maybe they'll patch the Move controller into it.

570
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:04,000
But it's basically, imagine like Superman crossed with Earth Defense Force.

571
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
So you're flying around at like really fast speed and stuff like that

572
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
in and out of the atmosphere and destroying aliens with like heat vision and stuff.

573
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
And you can blow up buildings and they just crumble down to the ground.

574
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
It's my type of game.

575
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
So I'm definitely wanting to check that out.

576
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
So I'll try this week to actually get to those games

577
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
because I've just been meaning to do that.

578
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
But the problem is my wife's been watching The Office on TV,

579
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
and so like any games that require me to stand up and use the Move controllers and stuff

580
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,000
might make it hard to watch TV because, you know, it's in the same room.

581
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Even though I don't need the TV because I have the headset, it's just, you know.

582
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
She just needs to read books.

583
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I got her books for a reason, to read them.

584
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
She does at the gym though.

585
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
But we're almost out of office.

586
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
We're almost out of office because we're on the final season again.

587
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
But she does this where she'll occasionally just jump into a random episode

588
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
and just finish the whole series.

589
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Which is fine because this show's hilarious.

590
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
It is funny.

591
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
All right, anything else?

592
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
That's it.

593
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
All right.

594
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,

595
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
use the passphrase, beam.

596
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
My gaming week. I'm not going to lie.

597
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I had a really rough week personally and I kind of told you a little bit about that earlier

598
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
and there's other stuff going on.

599
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I haven't really played a lot of video games.

600
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
In fact, even that Big Brother game I was talking to you guys about that I was playing,

601
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I ended up quitting it.

602
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
And that was not an easy thing to do.

603
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,000
But let me put it this way, even though most people are going to totally misunderstand this reference.

604
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
But Jamie will understand this reference.

605
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I know JD will understand this reference.

606
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
It was kind of like a door in All-Stars 2.

607
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I completely understand why a door left All-Stars 2 now

608
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
because it was a very similar thing that caused me to kind of...

609
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
the psychological intensity of that game,

610
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I could not handle it with everything else that was going on.

611
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
So they were very nice about it and they were like,

612
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
oh, you'll have an open invite to come back when we want,

613
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
which I thought was very, very nice and classy and all that.

614
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
And I was a little disappointed that I couldn't kind of stick with it.

615
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
But you guys, it has not been a good week.

616
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
So I just thought I'd give you that update.

617
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
As far as video games go, though, I did play some stuff.

618
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Just not a lot of new stuff.

619
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I played a lot of Pokemon Go, actually.

620
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I've been playing a lot of that.

621
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
The Halloween event's been a nice motivator,

622
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
but I've also just kind of gotten in this routine

623
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
where I will nuke lunch at my desk and kind of have that ready to go.

624
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
And then I go on a big 30-minute walk

625
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
and I use my little Pokemon Go clicker to catch Mons

626
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
and then I'm walking too.

627
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
So it's a nice little...

628
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,000
My route is 2K, so I can hatch a 2K egg easy.

629
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
It's just a little over 2K.

630
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
So I can hatch a 2K egg easy on my route.

631
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
So that's kind of one thing I've been doing.

632
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
And then I've also been playing a little bit of Heroes of the Storm this week

633
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,000
because I've been trying to do my daily quest to save some gold

634
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
so I can buy Junkrat, who has just released into the game.

635
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
So Heroes of the Storm has been kind of fun.

636
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I pretty much only play the AI stuff, though.

637
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:10,000
I don't know if I can handle some of the real people matches right now,

638
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
which I don't know.

639
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
I can handle it in Overwatch,

640
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
but people can get really nasty on their keyboards

641
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
in games like Heroes of the Storm.

642
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
But I'll probably try to dip my toe in

643
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
and play some more actual PvP in those games soon.

644
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
One other kind of random thing I'll mention that I played this week,

645
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
probably because I was playing so much Pokemon Go

646
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
and I've been collecting so much like Gen 1 and 2

647
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
and now even a little bit of 3 stuff,

648
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I was like, you know what?

649
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
I'm going to download Pokemon Silver because that's on Virtual Console

650
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,000
and I really never played a lot of that before.

651
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I think I might have played a little bit on an emulator years ago,

652
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
but I haven't really played that game.

653
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:58,000
I didn't know if I would respond well to playing an old Pokemon game,

654
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
but I downloaded it and I paid the 10 bucks or whatever it is on 3DS.

655
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I downloaded it and I've played an hour or two,

656
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
enough to where I'm about to take on the first gym,

657
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
so enough to dip my toe in, and I'm having enough fun with it.

658
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
The only weird thing is with there not being an XP share,

659
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
that's the really annoying part of the old Pokemon games.

660
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,000
You have to have a Pokemon go in, pull it out,

661
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
and then send the real one in so you can share the XP

662
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
and get a little bit on that first Pokemon.

663
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
That's how you level them up.

664
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Yes, and as William2DxSLface in our chat points out,

665
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:40,000
the Virtual Console Silver can transfer Pokemon one way to the Pokemon Bank.

666
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Yeah, and that was a big motivator too,

667
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
because if I do get Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon,

668
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:50,000
which I don't know if I will because I didn't really finish Pokemon Moon,

669
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
and I can't really explain the why in that.

670
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I think that's just my whole ADD.

671
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I think Pokemon always gets to a point for me where it's like,

672
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
there's too much.

673
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
There's like Pokemon Fashion Show,

674
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
there's Pokemon Berry Growing, there's Pokemon,

675
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
and my brain says you have to do it all,

676
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
even though you really don't have to do that,

677
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
and I think that's where I always struggle in Pokemon games.

678
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
So will my playthrough of Pokemon Silver be any different?

679
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000
I don't know. We'll see, but so far, so good.

680
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Anyway, that was my gaming week.

681
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
So how about you, JD? How was your gaming week?

682
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
What types of games have you played?

683
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
I've been playing a lot of Splatoon, especially after the Splatfest,

684
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
which I know was two weeks ago.

685
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I got up to the king rank in the Splatfest,

686
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
which is the top line,

687
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
and I've been playing ranked a lot more than Turf War,

688
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
and I finally made it to the league,

689
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
which you have to get to...

690
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Oh, I'm so sorry, JD. They can't hear you.

691
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
That's why I'm ripping it away.

692
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
You have to put the mic right up against your mouth.

693
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Okay.

694
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Other than Splatoon, which I've really been putting a lot of time in,

695
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Coming Out on Top, which is a gay dating game,

696
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
came out on Steam this week.

697
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
So even though it's four years old at this point,

698
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I played through it to get all the achievements,

699
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
and they also put new art in.

700
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
So that's been fun.

701
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
I've been playing Konga Master Party,

702
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
which is a...

703
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
It's not a rhythm game.

704
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
It's kind of a variation on Snake,

705
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
where you walk around a bunch of people,

706
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
and you try to convince them to join your Konga line,

707
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
and then things happen.

708
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
It's a lot of fun, and it has a cool multiplayer mode.

709
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
P-Cross on Switch has also been a good, relaxing game.

710
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
And I signed up for Twitch a little while ago

711
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
just to stream Cook, Serve, Delicious 2,

712
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
which also came out in the past month.

713
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
And that's been an interesting change,

714
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
and I haven't gotten very many viewers,

715
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
but it's a fun experience.

716
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Well, you should probably plug your channel so we can follow you.

717
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Yeah, my username is JD, which is J-A-I underscore D-I-T.

718
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I have a buddy on Twitch who streams a lot of that Cook, Serve, Delicious 2,

719
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
and it looks like it's kind of a fun game.

720
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
It looks like it's a little bit chaotic.

721
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
It looks almost like a typing tutor game, though,

722
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
because you're just typing so fast.

723
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
So my nickname for the game is Mavis Bacon Teaches Typing,

724
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
because it really is a typing game.

725
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
You can play with a controller or a mouse, but you shouldn't.

726
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
It's like clicking your skills in an MMO.

727
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
It makes the most sense to really do it with a keyboard,

728
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
because there are just so many different things,

729
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
and a lot of it just comes ultimately down to muscle memory.

730
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
There's a lot of different recipes,

731
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
and you have to prepare them on the fly.

732
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Somebody will say, well, I want nachos done with these toppings,

733
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
and then the next order might come in and it'll be completely different,

734
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,000
and you have to find the right keys on three different screens of it.

735
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
So having a keyboard really helps.

736
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
But yeah, it's a lot of just remembering how it works,

737
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,000
but typing is the gist of the gameplay.

738
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
For the record, I click on skills in Final Fantasy XIV.

739
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Some of them, some of them.

740
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I use my keyboard for some.

741
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Usually when I'm healing, I use my keyboard for the cures,

742
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
and I use the clicking for the stuff that's off cycle,

743
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
which I know is kind of weird, but that's just how I do it, okay?

744
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I mean, my guilty secret is that I do the same thing in Guild Wars 2.

745
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I'm really lazy about it,

746
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
because I also don't have a mouse with 19 buttons on it,

747
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
so I'm just using a regular keyboard for the most part.

748
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Dartetsuya in chat suggests that it sounds like an OLR dream game.

749
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Loki presents Mavis Bacon teaches typing,

750
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
so maybe that's something that can happen in the future.

751
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
I did see that the wonderful channel Epic Meal Time,

752
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,000
where they had a recipe for pizza bacon, which looks amazing.

753
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,000
It's basically bacon with cheese and pepperoni on it.

754
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Nice. All right.

755
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Well, thank you, JD, for sharing your gaming week with us.

756
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000
We're going to get to a little bit of housekeeping.

757
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.

758
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
We're also on Facebook at Orange Lounge Radio on Facebook,

759
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,000
and as a reminder, we will not be here November 12th.

760
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,000
It's Veterans Day weekend. I am taking a vacation.

761
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Why? Because I deserve it.

762
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
I'm taking a vacation, and I won't be here because I'll be in Seattle.

763
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
If you happen to live in that area,

764
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
because we went a couple years ago,

765
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
so we've done the Space Needle, we've done the EMP,

766
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
all that stuff is cool.

767
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
We've done Pike's Market, which we're going to do that again

768
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
because we love the market,

769
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
but if you have suggestions for what else we should do there

770
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
that's not all the uber touristy stuff, I'm open for ideas.

771
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Hit me up on Twitter at Skye, S-K-I-E, especially gamer stuff.

772
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I think it would be really cool.

773
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Like arcades I should be checking out

774
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
that isn't the one across the street from the convention center

775
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
because I've been there a million times.

776
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Places like that. That would be awesome.

777
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Anyway, let's now get into some gaming news.

778
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Loki's starting us off tonight.

779
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
All right. Well, there's lots to talk about Nintendo,

780
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:11,000
and of course all this has to do with the recent 4.0 firmware update.

781
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
So lots of features being added to it,

782
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,000
including things that really a lot of other systems have had for a while,

783
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
but it's nice to see them here.

784
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
So one thing that they added was video capture,

785
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
and it's kind of limited at the moment.

786
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
It only works on certain games.

787
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,000
So like, for example, Breath of the Wild, Mario Kart 8,

788
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Arms, and Splatoon 2.

789
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:38,000
And they haven't really said if it's going to be added with other games,

790
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
but so far those are the four.

791
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:48,000
And with that, of course, you can upload the clips to Facebook or Twitter,

792
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
and it captures the last 30 seconds.

793
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
So it's something, I guess.

794
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:58,000
And then, of course, you can also transfer your profiles and saves to another Switch.

795
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
So I guess if you run into an issue where your Switch dies

796
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,000
or if you just need to move it over or something like that, you can do that.

797
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
So that's kind of cool.

798
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:13,000
And then along with that, of course, they've added support as well for some USB headsets.

799
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Once again, though, it's not exactly everything.

800
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:22,000
So basically you can use USB headsets.

801
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,000
They need to be plugged into a dock where it's recognized by the Switch,

802
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:33,000
and I guess you can also do USB speakers that way as well.

803
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
And yeah, I don't know.

804
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
It sounds kind of limited there.

805
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:45,000
So based on that, you're not going to be able to use it for voice chat, though, apparently.

806
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Well, how convenient.

807
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Yeah.

808
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,000
But then along with that, though, despite all those limitations,

809
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
the Switch, of course, is still doing very well.

810
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:06,000
They've sold 2 million units in the US and worldwide 4.7 units.

811
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Total failure.

812
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Well, just kidding.

813
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
There's a lot of things that they really should have in there that they don't have in there,

814
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,000
like where the fuck is Virtual Console or whatever the fuck is going to replace it.

815
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Well, not everything can be the 3DO.

816
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Well, but based on what you just said, Loki, does it matter?

817
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
I mean, it's selling pretty well.

818
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,000
And even though most of us hardcore gamers are sitting here going,

819
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
but what about X?

820
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
And your voice chat is garbage.

821
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Like, does it matter?

822
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Because it's still selling.

823
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:45,000
So clearly Nintendo does literally whatever the fuck they want,

824
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,000
and they can do it because they're Nintendo.

825
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
And it doesn't matter.

826
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Nothing matters.

827
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Yeah.

828
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
I don't know.

829
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:03,000
It's funny seeing the Switch and how it operates with things

830
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
and then also looking at different emulators like the CMU

831
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:14,000
that basically can port out a better-looking version of Zelda Breath of the Wild

832
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,000
with all these enhanced features that the Switch can't possibly do.

833
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
And it's like, holy shit.

834
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Imagine if there's just more power in this, what you can do.

835
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
But then again, when we're talking about Nintendo,

836
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
and they'll just do things their way, and they're like,

837
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
well, we sold some, so obviously it's doing well,

838
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
and we're not going to change anything.

839
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,000
We're going to be, what was the word, brave?

840
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:43,000
What's Apple's term for, like, we're going to remove those headphone ports

841
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
because we're adventurous.

842
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
I believe it was brave.

843
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Courage.

844
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
I don't know what it was.

845
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
It was courage.

846
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
They took a lot of crap for that.

847
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
They're courageous, yes.

848
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
It's just Nintendo being courageous.

849
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
But to be fair in that whole thing,

850
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
didn't their most recent Android phone just make the same change?

851
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,000
And now people are like, oh, okay, whatever.

852
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
So I'm just saying, just saying.

853
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
All right, anyway.

854
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
That's called being a hypocrite.

855
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
But it made wood change?

856
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:21,000
They got rid, the Pixel 2 or whatever got rid of that headphone jack.

857
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
And it's the same thing now where you have to use a converter

858
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
to have a headphone jack.

859
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Oh, that's a Pixel. No one wants those.

860
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
All right.

861
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
See, that's one of those phones that they're like, hey, look it,

862
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
we're like Apple 2.

863
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Getting away from phones and back to Nintendo.

864
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
What do you think about the whole video recording thing, though?

865
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
I haven't used it yet.

866
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,000
It sounds all right, but it's like 30 seconds, really?

867
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
I mean, I guess that's all the system can handle,

868
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
but...

869
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Well, I believe actdeft in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com

870
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
said something to the effect of Nintendo said they were going to make it

871
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
so they can record more than 30 seconds in the future.

872
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
So it's 30 seconds now.

873
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Then why can't they do it now?

874
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Why is it only 30 seconds now?

875
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Because Nintendo's going to do whatever they want.

876
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
And they're like, we have to figure out how this Internet thing works.

877
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
It's Nintendo's world.

878
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
We're just living in it.

879
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
And it doesn't matter whatever Nintendo does.

880
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
They're never going to make you happy, Loki.

881
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
They are going to make me happy.

882
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
They would just be competent at what they're doing.

883
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
And don't get me wrong.

884
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,000
See, they suffer from what the thing that Apple suffers is,

885
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
that people are basically evangelists for these products

886
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
and they can release a pile of shit with Nintendo's name on it

887
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
and they will buy it.

888
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
I mean, call me crazy,

889
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
but is there maybe a reason why people get enthusiastic,

890
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,000
especially when we're talking about games like Breath of the Wild,

891
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Splatoon 2?

892
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
I mean, these games are pretty fucking rad.

893
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,000
And Mario Odyssey is going to be good.

894
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
It's just an accepted fact.

895
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
It's going to be a good game.

896
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
We know it's going to be a good game.

897
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Has Nintendo made a bad mainline Mario game?

898
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Some may say Mario Sunshine, to which I say have a seat.

899
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Mario Sunshine was great.

900
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
We did have Mario was missing.

901
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
But that wasn't a mainline Mario game.

902
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,000
That was a mistake of licensing Mario to some other developer

903
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
to make potty garbage.

904
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Although, the one thing that game proved to me

905
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:23,000
was that it could actually run on early Super Nintendo level graphics

906
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,000
because it had some of the same dungeon music and scenery.

907
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Well, that's right.

908
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
And it was even on the NES, wasn't it?

909
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
I thought the game was on the Super Nintendo.

910
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
It was on the NES.

911
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
It might have been one of those rare games that was on both, too.

912
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
So, anyway.

913
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
I mean, it's fine.

914
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I guess we don't need headset support for your games,

915
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
and we don't need three-court clips.

916
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Well, Loki, you don't right now.

917
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
What is everybody doing?

918
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Any Switch owner I know right now is like, Discord, Skype, whatever.

919
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
We work around it.

920
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,000
We don't need Nintendo to do it because we figured it out another way.

921
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Well, exactly.

922
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Why should they put the effort in if everyone's going to put the effort for them

923
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
and then praise them for it?

924
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
So, then are we all in agreement?

925
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Fuck it.

926
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Nintendo voice chat?

927
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Fuck it.

928
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
We've all just...

929
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
They're not going to do it.

930
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
They have not been able to rise.

931
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
We've all figured out a way around it now.

932
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Fuck it.

933
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Nintendo could just move those resources somewhere else.

934
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
This has gone on without Nintendo.

935
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Whatever you guys want to do.

936
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
As long as you're happy.

937
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
As long as you're happy with them.

938
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Fucking just sitting there going...

939
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Whatever sinks your battleship.

940
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Well, you know what?

941
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
We could develop this feature, but fuck it.

942
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
We'll just let them go ahead and just do it for us,

943
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
and then we're just going to sit back and relax.

944
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Loki just sounds like that whole group sitting around going,

945
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
where do you want to go to dinner?

946
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
I don't know.

947
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Where do you want to go to dinner?

948
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
I don't know where you want to go to dinner.

949
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Well, somebody just made a goddamn decision.

950
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
All right, we're going to go to Applebee's.

951
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
That would be more the equivalent.

952
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Okay, we'll just make dinner.

953
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
And Loki, whatever you want to do.

954
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Applebee's, really?

955
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
All right, fine.

956
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Whatever you want to do.

957
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
I'm over it.

958
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Fine.

959
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Sometimes it's just easier to agree

960
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,000
and let the argument end, to try to even bother.

961
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Because at this point, you're just having an ill...

962
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,000
You're trying to argue logic with Nintendo,

963
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
and there just isn't any.

964
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,000
But they sold two million Switches, so...

965
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I know. I know.

966
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,000
It's not that I disagree completely, Loki,

967
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
but it's one of those things...

968
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
I, too, really wish,

969
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
I think a lot of Nintendo fans really wish

970
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,000
we could figure out what the fuck is going on with Virtual Console,

971
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
and will I be able to take NES games on the go?

972
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Or is Virtual Console going to be for GameCube games?

973
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Or what the hell is Nintendo doing?

974
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Because Nintendo does have a large back catalogue

975
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
I would like to be playing.

976
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
I think a lot of Nintendo fans are in that same boat.

977
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
So there are things I think even the most hardcore

978
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Nintendo fans would agree with you on,

979
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
and those types of things.

980
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
They're just leaving money on the table.

981
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
That's what it is.

982
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Yeah.

983
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
But at the same time,

984
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Nintendo can just kind of do what they want,

985
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
and they sell two million, and it works.

986
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
So why not?

987
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Well, I hope nothing else big comes out.

988
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
All right. Moving on.

989
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Let's move on to talk about Gran Turismo Sport.

990
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Hey, you want to talk about online mode being challenging?

991
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Let's see what's happening on the PlayStation 4,

992
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
because here's the alternative, Loki.

993
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Oh, I didn't even think what a great fucking follow-up

994
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,000
this was going to be, but here we go.

995
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:29,000
So Gran Turismo Sport came out this past week on Tuesday,

996
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
and guess what?

997
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Because Gran Turismo Sport had the servers down

998
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
for a couple days,

999
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
you couldn't connect to the servers for a little bit.

1000
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
I guess that was during the review cycle,

1001
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,000
not after the game once came out, just to be fair.

1002
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
But something that people were realizing is that

1003
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,000
if you could not connect to the servers,

1004
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:53,000
you couldn't play the game hardly at all.

1005
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Technically, you can play the game. Technically.

1006
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
But you can't save your file.

1007
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Yes.

1008
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
That's right. To save your fucking game,

1009
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:07,000
you had to be online in order to save your game in arcade mode.

1010
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Yes, and I'm sure that plan will work out swingly.

1011
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,000
I'm sure that that's not a terrible idea at all.

1012
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Why are they doing this?

1013
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Because it has to be.

1014
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Because they're assholes.

1015
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Well, they're not going to.

1016
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
The official press release doesn't say,

1017
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
we're doing this because we're assholes.

1018
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
That's not how game companies spin.

1019
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Because they're courageous. We're so courageous.

1020
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
The real reason is the link up between

1021
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Gran Turismo and the FIA,

1022
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,000
which is an organization that runs motorsport around the world.

1023
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,000
FIA Esports is an integral part of what they're trying to do

1024
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
with Gran Theft Auto.

1025
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Gran Theft Turismo.

1026
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Gran Theft is a Gran Turismo sport.

1027
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,000
So, saves being in the cloud,

1028
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
that is meant to keep people from cheating,

1029
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,000
so that they are not cheating within the game,

1030
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
and all of that.

1031
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:59,000
So, you can, I guess, thank cheaters for this being all online.

1032
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
That is a load of horseshit.

1033
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,000
It's like, if only we had the ability to create

1034
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,000
a separate save profile for online and offline.

1035
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
If only that were such a thing we could program,

1036
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
but we just can't program it.

1037
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Now, so, Loki, keeping in mind that we just followed up

1038
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,000
a story about Nintendo being a little bit behind.

1039
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Here we are, over on Sony's side,

1040
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
and that's what this future looks like,

1041
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
and it's kind of poopy caca.

1042
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Because at least to Nintendo's credit,

1043
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,000
they've designed a system out of

1044
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,000
pick up your game and take it out the building

1045
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
where there's no Wi-Fi and you're good.

1046
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Like, you can play Skyrim wherever the fuck you want.

1047
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
You don't need internet.

1048
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Single player? Not a problem.

1049
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
It's online where we're challenged.

1050
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Exactly, you kind of have to have online

1051
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
or they'll be able to have this online crap,

1052
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
and they don't have online.

1053
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:57,000
They have a tin can phone of online right now.

1054
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,000
I mean, so, that's...

1055
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
They have AOL dial-up.

1056
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
And you know what?

1057
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
If they grow as big as far as online goes,

1058
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
you can bet that they're just dabbing

1059
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
in this kind of bullshit, okay?

1060
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Don't get me...

1061
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
We've got Animal Crossing still coming out.

1062
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Can't wait to see how that goes on mobile.

1063
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:19,000
I mean, you know, just because

1064
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,000
any company that does this sort of shit is dickish.

1065
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
I mean, EA has done this.

1066
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Blizzard has done this kind of crap.

1067
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
You know, with Diablo 3.

1068
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Yeah, I was gonna say, to be fair to, you know,

1069
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Sony and all that stuff,

1070
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
it's not like games haven't had an

1071
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
always online requirement before.

1072
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Any MMO is gonna require you to be online.

1073
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Any of them.

1074
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Like you said, Diablo 3.

1075
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
And everybody thought,

1076
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
oh, this is the end for Diablo.

1077
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Turns out it wasn't the always online part

1078
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
that killed Diablo.

1079
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
It was that auction house,

1080
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
which is why it was always online.

1081
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
But now the auction house is gone.

1082
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Diablo's kind of rad.

1083
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
It's just, it's...

1084
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
This excuse is dumb.

1085
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Because this reminds me exactly of SimCity with EA.

1086
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Because they said,

1087
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:04,000
oh, I have to do all this online processing stuff in the cloud

1088
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
because it's just not possible to push out these fucking

1089
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,000
amazing physics and graphics.

1090
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
That's a load of horseshit.

1091
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
It was a load of horseshit.

1092
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
And same reason for this.

1093
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Oh, we have to tie in this esports network.

1094
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
What if I want to play offline

1095
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:20,000
and I don't give a flying fuck about esports?

1096
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
All right.

1097
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Quickly, before I go to your next story, Jamie,

1098
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
anything you want to chime in on?

1099
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
No, I want to do my story.

1100
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
All right, fine.

1101
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Go ahead.

1102
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:33,000
So they've put out the information on the amiibo

1103
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,000
that will be coming out for Super Mario Odyssey.

1104
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Lots of interesting compatibility.

1105
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,000
And one of the questions was about Peach's wedding dress.

1106
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Well, it works on Mario.

1107
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,000
So I reckon if Link can run around in a Gerudo outfit,

1108
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,000
then Mario can run around in a beautiful wedding dress.

1109
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Because you know what?

1110
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,000
It's a good day for a white wedding.

1111
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,000
But the image of Mario in a wedding dress is rad.

1112
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
I love it.

1113
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
And my favorite thing I saw on the entire internet

1114
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:07,000
was a tweet that had that picture next to a still from Paris is Burning

1115
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,000
that said Butch Queen first time at a ball.

1116
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,000
I died.

1117
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
So did they get the costumes from other people?

1118
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
So could we do zero suit Samus with...

1119
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:23,000
It would be cool, but I don't think this sleeveless is the right look for...

1120
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Sorry, strapless is the right look for Mario.

1121
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
He's a little down on his hair grooming.

1122
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
He's a little too bare for us.

1123
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,000
It's real season two wedding realness.

1124
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Yeah, it is.

1125
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
No, it's the...

1126
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Which season was it?

1127
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
No, yeah, it was...

1128
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,000
No, I'm talking about where the queens were dressing up,

1129
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
the women's husbands or fiancés.

1130
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
I think that was season six.

1131
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
That was because it was Bianca.

1132
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
That's what this is.

1133
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:57,000
It's dressing up very, very, very hairy straight men.

1134
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
No, I don't think it's the same as the half and half.

1135
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
There was at least some waxing done.

1136
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Anyway, away from Drag Race talk for a minute here.

1137
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Well, I think it's cute.

1138
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,000
It's not that serious.

1139
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,000
A Mario game is not that serious,

1140
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,000
and it's just one of those things where it's humorous.

1141
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:24,000
You know there's going to be some bro dude who gets his mantis in a bunch.

1142
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
And don't buy the amoeba.

1143
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Can he do peaches like float with this thing?

1144
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
It'd be cool.

1145
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
We don't know. That would be cool, though, if he could.

1146
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:39,000
If a bro is that worried that Mario wearing a wedding dress in the game

1147
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:44,000
is going to somehow impact this bro's sexuality or something,

1148
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
then let me tell you, that bro has a lot of other problems

1149
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
that have nothing to do with video games.

1150
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:55,000
If something external is making you that uncomfortable with your own sexuality,

1151
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,000
then maybe you were uncomfortable with it to begin with.

1152
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
I have some confused feelings about Mario now.

1153
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
It's such an awkward boner about it.

1154
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Anyway, there you go.

1155
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
I'm excited for this game.

1156
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Not just that. I mean, I was already excited for Mario Odyssey.

1157
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,000
But I think what kind of made me giggle about this

1158
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:22,000
was that remember all the controversy about the sombrero wearing Mario

1159
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:27,000
and people were like, how could you appropriate Mexican culture like that?

1160
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Whereas Act Deaf, who's here and lives in Mexico,

1161
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
is like, actually, I think it's kind of funny.

1162
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,000
And most people are not funny, but I think it's kind of rad.

1163
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
And most people here think it's kind of adorable

1164
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,000
and love to see ourselves represented like that and so forth.

1165
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
I think this is just kind of one of those things

1166
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
where it kind of just takes it a step further.

1167
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:49,000
It's just like they're just silly costumes for fun that Mario...

1168
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:55,000
It's like Halloween. People dress up as fun things.

1169
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
It's not that serious.

1170
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Anyway.

1171
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Oh, I didn't realize Mariochi had a name.

1172
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Thank you, Act Deaf. That's a great name.

1173
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Mariochi.

1174
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
All right.

1175
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Let's move on with another news story.

1176
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Loki.

1177
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
All right.

1178
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
So speaking of evil companies earlier,

1179
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Activision has decided...

1180
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Now, they've patented a technique that allows matchmaking

1181
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:25,000
to influence players into buying microtransactions.

1182
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
So how does this work?

1183
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Basically, in the matchmaking system,

1184
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
you normally think that it would team you up with people

1185
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,000
that are of equal skill level.

1186
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,000
This actually would kind of fuck that whole system up

1187
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,000
by teaming up against people that are slightly better than you,

1188
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,000
and they would have certain unlockable gear

1189
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
that you would want to buy.

1190
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:51,000
And so with that, they kind of figure out which DLC

1191
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,000
or loot boxes or whatever that you're interested in purchasing

1192
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
and keep kind of taunting you with these players

1193
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
that are better than you

1194
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,000
and kind of trying to drive you into purchasing that stuff.

1195
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,000
So basically, they've patented a way to break

1196
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,000
the fucking matchmaking system at their own benefit.

1197
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,000
But don't worry.

1198
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,000
They haven't implemented any of their games yet.

1199
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,000
They would fucking admit to that if that was a thing.

1200
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
So I don't know.

1201
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
But some of the examples they set in there...

1202
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
For example, if a player purchased a particular weapon,

1203
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,000
the microtransaction engine might match the player

1204
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,000
in a gameplay session in which the particular weapon

1205
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
is highly effective.

1206
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Yeah, right.

1207
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
That's one of the ways that they're saying.

1208
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Or this might encourage players to make future purchases

1209
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
to achieve similar gameplay results.

1210
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,000
The matchmaking system would analyze player trends

1211
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
such as latency and weapon preference

1212
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
in order to place them in scenarios

1213
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,000
that might lead them to buy certain items.

1214
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
That's just sick.

1215
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
It's sick.

1216
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:53,000
And especially seeing how games like even Destiny

1217
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,000
and just a lot of these games,

1218
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
especially like this end of the year,

1219
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,000
come out with like...

1220
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Didn't Bungie come out and say, though,

1221
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,000
not in our game.

1222
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
This is not here.

1223
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Stop. Get your tinfoil hats off.

1224
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,000
They can say whatever the fuck they want.

1225
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Doesn't mean...

1226
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:13,000
How are we going to prove if that's not the case?

1227
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,000
How would we even prove that?

1228
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,000
We can't prove that.

1229
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
So they can say whatever the fuck they want.

1230
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
I don't trust Activision.

1231
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
I don't trust them.

1232
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Because this is a company that's taken stuff

1233
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,000
that was a feature in a game,

1234
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
the previous game, like Destiny,

1235
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:32,000
like especially with the different shaders.

1236
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,000
They've taken it and they've handicapped it now

1237
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
and locked it behind loot boxes.

1238
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
So I'm sorry.

1239
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,000
It's like they keep grabbing for money

1240
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
and EA's doing this shit now with loot boxes.

1241
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Everybody's doing loot boxes.

1242
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Not in the way that Overwatch is doing it.

1243
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
And so what makes me...

1244
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
If I see companies acting greedy,

1245
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,000
what makes me think that I can trust them?

1246
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Why patent something like this

1247
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,000
if you're not going to fucking use it?

1248
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
You don't just come up with an idea like,

1249
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
well, we'll just patent it for funsies.

1250
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
I mean, no, they're going to do this

1251
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
so that no one else can do it.

1252
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
So Bobby Black Wolf,

1253
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
who does the show before us here at VOG,

1254
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,000
is needling your argument a little bit in chat,

1255
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,000
getting you to think a little different here.

1256
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
He says they could not do something

1257
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
and I'd still hate them for it.

1258
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Kind of like hating Microsoft

1259
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
because they thought about making the Xbox One

1260
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
require an online connection

1261
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,000
only to reverse course before the console comes out.

1262
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Exactly.

1263
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
So you agree?

1264
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
No, I agree.

1265
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,000
You are agreeing with his point

1266
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
that they could not do something

1267
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
and you're going to hate them for it.

1268
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Right, because just the fact that they thought...

1269
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
No, no, seriously though.

1270
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
The fact that they went this far with an idea

1271
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
and based on what we've seen so far.

1272
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
So I'm basing off their past actions

1273
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
like Call of Duty 4,

1274
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
adding microtransactions to a game

1275
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
that was good on its own.

1276
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
They didn't need to put that in there.

1277
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Okay, because I'm sure Bobby's sitting there going,

1278
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
well, that wasn't the response I expected.

1279
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
What you're really trying to say is that

1280
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
your issue is that

1281
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:06,000
somebody in a boardroom at Activision

1282
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:10,000
came up with this idea for a purpose

1283
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,000
and based on Activision's track record,

1284
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
which you don't think is so great

1285
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
based on some of the other things they've done

1286
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,000
in bringing Skylanders out, for example.

1287
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
My kids try to watch that show.

1288
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Fuck, that's awful.

1289
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
But yeah, it's...

1290
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
So you are concerned that even though

1291
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Bungie is saying not in our game,

1292
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,000
you go, because Activision bothered to take the time

1293
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
to come up with it,

1294
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,000
I'm still mad at them because this just shows

1295
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,000
an assembly line of evil.

1296
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
It's basically, it's kind of showing

1297
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
where their mindset is.

1298
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:49,000
And you see that with not only this patent,

1299
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
but you see it with their past actions.

1300
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,000
So with adding unnecessary loot boxes

1301
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
and DLC systems into games

1302
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
that didn't require them before.

1303
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Or for example, milking games,

1304
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:04,000
milking franchises until they burn them into the ground,

1305
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
a la Guitar Hero,

1306
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,000
or even Skylanders if you want to go that far.

1307
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:14,000
It's just, it's another example of the stuff

1308
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
that we've seen them already doing.

1309
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
And this is just taking it one step further.

1310
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:22,000
And it's like, I wouldn't put it past them to do that.

1311
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Do I think that Destiny 2 has it in there?

1312
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:27,000
I don't know, but I wouldn't put it past them to do that.

1313
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
And just because it's not in there now,

1314
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,000
who's to say that they couldn't do that on the back end

1315
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,000
and you would be none the wiser?

1316
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
I kind of feel like, Loki,

1317
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:38,000
I actually kind of get where you're coming from.

1318
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Even looking at Bobby's counterpoint,

1319
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
I understand the whole idea of,

1320
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,000
I have trust issues with gaming companies

1321
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
based on some of the shit I've seen in the past.

1322
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
That part of it, I get.

1323
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
But here's my thought, Loki,

1324
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
is that you say, we can't prove it,

1325
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
it could be in there and we don't know,

1326
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,000
or anything like that.

1327
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Wouldn't Twitter figure that shit out in a heartbeat?

1328
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Like, hackers gonna hack, right?

1329
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Like, if something nefarious were to be happening in games,

1330
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
people fucking are very observant

1331
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:11,000
when it comes to things like patterns and changes.

1332
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Like, every time Pokemon Go does an update,

1333
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
within five hours, somebody's gone in there

1334
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,000
and hacked the update to tell you,

1335
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,000
here's everything under the hood that's really changed.

1336
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Isn't that still gonna happen?

1337
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Isn't that gonna keep game companies accountable?

1338
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,000
That's the part where I kind of disagree with you,

1339
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,000
is I think if they change it, people are gonna find out.

1340
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
They wouldn't know, because you're talking about,

1341
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,000
you can hack the client all you want

1342
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
and figure out what's in the client.

1343
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
We're talking about matchmaking servers.

1344
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,000
It's server software that's gonna be making these decisions.

1345
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
And so whether, however, the client,

1346
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
the client can just send over information

1347
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,000
of what DLC you own, or like, the different stats,

1348
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
or whatever, that they can probably sniff out,

1349
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
if that's still a thing.

1350
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
But I don't know how their algorithm's

1351
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
working with something like this,

1352
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
but to actually see the process of how they're matchmaking,

1353
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
that's all on the server side.

1354
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
You're not gonna actually get to see that.

1355
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Well, Dungeon Buster, with a fair kind of counterpoint,

1356
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
without saying, people are still guesstimating RNG

1357
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
in a wide range of MMOs.

1358
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,000
So I mean, the scientific method, if you will,

1359
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
could still be applied.

1360
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Well, and even with RNG stuff,

1361
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
I mean, what's it say?

1362
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Because I've been in different games,

1363
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
and it hasn't perfectly matched me with people.

1364
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Is that because of something like this,

1365
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:32,000
or is that because it's just a shitty matchmaking process,

1366
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
or based on the players that were available,

1367
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
that was the closest they could match?

1368
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,000
How are you gonna know?

1369
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,000
There's so many factors.

1370
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,000
But it's just the mindset that they would come up

1371
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
with an idea like this that's evil.

1372
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
That is what's evil.

1373
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:49,000
I wanna do something a little unusual here on OLR,

1374
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
but I really feel like there's another important

1375
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
follow-up point that needs to be made.

1376
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Loki, can you get into your next story you have on show rule?

1377
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
I wanna do things out of order here.

1378
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Sorry, Jamie.

1379
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
But there's a reason.

1380
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:05,000
So EA, they have shut down Visceral Games.

1381
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:08,000
So Visceral Games was, of course,

1382
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
they had produced different games,

1383
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
like Battlefield Hardline,

1384
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
of course the Dead Space series,

1385
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,000
and they were working on a new Star Wars game.

1386
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Apparently they're saying now that Visceral Studios

1387
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
has been developing an action-adventure title

1388
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,000
set in the Star Wars universe,

1389
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
which I think I've heard people describe it

1390
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
as kind of like an uncharted type of game,

1391
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
more of a single-player experience.

1392
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
They're saying in its current form,

1393
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:34,000
it was shaping up to be a story-based linear adventure game.

1394
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Throughout the development process,

1395
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
we've been testing the game concepts with players,

1396
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:41,000
listening to feedback about what and how they want to play,

1397
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:44,000
and closely tracking fundamental shifts in the marketplace.

1398
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,000
It has become clear the delivered experience of players

1399
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,000
will want to come back to and enjoy for a long time to come.

1400
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
We need to pivot the design.

1401
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:57,000
So they're going to be ramping down and closing,

1402
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:03,000
and I guess they're saying that a development team

1403
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
from across worldwide studios

1404
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
will take over developing Ragtag,

1405
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
which was the game that they were,

1406
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
the code name for the Star Wars game,

1407
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
led by EA Vancouver,

1408
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
a team that has already been working on the project.

1409
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Steve Anthony will lead this team,

1410
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
and we will use much of the work

1411
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
that has been done to date by Visceral

1412
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
and the assets of Ragtag have already been built

1413
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
will be the foundation of this new game.

1414
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
So to make a long story short...

1415
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,000
I'm sorry.

1416
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
And then, of course, the assumption is

1417
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,000
it's safe to presume that the new incarnation of the Star Wars game

1418
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
will evolve to a Games as a Service element.

1419
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Right.

1420
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
So to make a long story short, essentially,

1421
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,000
it sounds like a single-player Star Wars...

1422
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:45,000
We'll say Star Wars Uncharted, for lack of a better word.

1423
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Or Tomb Raider.

1424
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Or Tomb Raider was canceled in favor of a Star Wars Destiny.

1425
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Granted, I am oversimplifying this scenario,

1426
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,000
but, you know, since most things are broken down

1427
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:58,000
into a 140-character tweet these days anyway,

1428
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
that is the Twitter version of what's going on here.

1429
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,000
And you can see why I'm having you bring this up now

1430
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
as a follow-up to what you just talked about,

1431
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:09,000
because this has caused a huge conversation on the internet

1432
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
and everywhere this week about

1433
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,000
are single-player experiences done for?

1434
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Are we at a point where everything has to be fucking multiplayer

1435
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,000
because game companies like EA, like Activision,

1436
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:25,000
see it as the only way to recoup these large budgets...

1437
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,000
No, no, no, no.

1438
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
It's not the only way to recoup.

1439
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
There's just a lot of money in online games

1440
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
because you're basically...

1441
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
You're constantly having stuff for sale.

1442
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Whereas a single-player game,

1443
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
you're gonna have limited expansions and stuff like that.

1444
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:40,000
They found out they can go the mobile route

1445
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
and they can constantly have things for sale,

1446
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,000
consumables for sale,

1447
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,000
and then that'll tempt people into buying that stuff

1448
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
and they can keep going that route,

1449
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
like Grand Theft Auto Online has done with shark cards

1450
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,000
and stuff like that,

1451
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:55,000
trying to tempt you to get in that type of behavior pattern.

1452
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,000
It's not...

1453
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
They can say that all they want.

1454
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:02,000
The AAA industry is not entirely 100% accurate on this stuff,

1455
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,000
and that's fine.

1456
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
They can go that route because, guess what?

1457
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,000
There's a healthy, thriving indie marketplace,

1458
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,000
and if they don't make the games that people want,

1459
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
they will come in and make the games for you.

1460
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:16,000
So they'll come out and make single-player experiences that you'll like,

1461
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:21,000
but to think that that's the only way that they can recoup their money,

1462
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,000
I'm sorry.

1463
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Maybe don't make games that fucking big.

1464
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,000
If you have such a problem recouping your money

1465
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
on these multi-million dollar games,

1466
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
maybe lower the scope a bit so that you're not...

1467
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,000
There's no reason you need to make these big,

1468
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,000
blockbuster, graphically intense, licensed games.

1469
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Just make good games.

1470
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
And I don't buy the bullshit for one second

1471
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:46,000
that they need to have these microtransactions.

1472
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Yeah, they would like to tow that line,

1473
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
and they would like to have people defend that,

1474
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
because, oh, they gotta run those servers and shit.

1475
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Yes, I get it.

1476
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,000
They have to pay for that stuff.

1477
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,000
But you know what?

1478
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
They've managed just fine before all this stuff happened.

1479
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,000
It's now they got a taste of the money they can make from it,

1480
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
and so that's why you're gonna see games come, you know,

1481
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
with more and more of these types of things.

1482
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,000
And that's fine.

1483
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
If you're fine with that and you wanna tow that line,

1484
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
that's the defense that they wanna take,

1485
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,000
then go ahead and partake in those games.

1486
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:12,000
I personally am not going to partake in those games,

1487
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,000
because it's bullshit.

1488
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
So at the end of the day, vote with your wallet.

1489
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
That's gonna say the loudest thing at all.

1490
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Yeah.

1491
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Well, and you know, I know again earlier

1492
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
you were picking on Nintendo a little bit

1493
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
for some of their choices, but I can't help but think,

1494
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
well, gosh, probably what's going to be

1495
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,000
the best single-player experience of this year.

1496
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
I mean, it's up for debate.

1497
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
But certainly Zelda Breath of the Wild

1498
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:36,000
is gonna be in everybody's top three or top five somewhere, right?

1499
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:40,000
So, and then I'm sure, you know, the game's not out yet,

1500
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
so we can't tell, but I have a pretty good feeling

1501
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Mario Odyssey is also going to deliver

1502
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
a strong single-player experience.

1503
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
So it is kind of interesting to me that

1504
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Nintendo now is seeming to rise up as that,

1505
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:55,000
which is weird because Nintendo is also that party company, right?

1506
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Especially when it was the Wii.

1507
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
It was like party games, party games, party games.

1508
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:02,000
But like, I do feel like it's very hard to argue

1509
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,000
that Zelda and likely Mario are going to be

1510
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:08,000
probably two of the strongest single-player experiences.

1511
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,000
So it's, Loki, I guess the reason why I'm bringing this up

1512
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:15,000
is it's like, doesn't that kind of leave you with

1513
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Nintendo as like the choice to kind of go to with your wallet

1514
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,000
because they're making those experiences?

1515
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:23,000
No, it doesn't. They make good single-player games.

1516
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Sony makes good single-player games as well.

1517
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:28,000
So I don't understand the argument that they think that it has to go all online

1518
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
because there's a lot of games that they have

1519
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
that are great single-player experiences that don't need online.

1520
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Uncharted, for example, has a great single-player experience.

1521
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Yeah, they kind of shoehorned some online in there.

1522
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Honestly, I don't think it's that great.

1523
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:44,000
But they have, you know, lots of great single-player experience games.

1524
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Even with, Microsoft has some pretty good single-player games out there.

1525
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:52,000
But I don't think it's going away forever.

1526
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
I mean, especially when you're talking about games,

1527
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:57,000
especially when they start shutting down these servers and stuff,

1528
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:00,000
people don't want to invest in a single-player game because,

1529
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
or in a multiplayer game like that,

1530
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
that they know that eventually might get shut down

1531
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
and their copy's completely useless.

1532
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Like, imagine when the servers get shut down for Gran Turismo Sport.

1533
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,000
That's kind of crap.

1534
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
All right, let me get to our chat because there's,

1535
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,000
I just turned to look at chat and it's lighting up over there.

1536
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,000
So let's get some voices from our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

1537
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Come on, Noel Gus, talks about Nintendo saying single-player

1538
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,000
but amiibos are their loot boxes.

1539
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Mega Man X400 in chat says single-player games have large budgets

1540
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:32,000
and when they don't sell five million copies, it's deemed a failure.

1541
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Square Enix deemed Tomb Raider a failure

1542
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:38,000
until it sold over seven million copies.

1543
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:43,000
SG100Matt says EA Sports makes more money with their in-game transaction services

1544
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
than actual sales of the games.

1545
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Bobby says in a series here,

1546
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Random Joe Gamer doesn't want pixelated shit from indies.

1547
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:54,000
They want big-budget, graphically impressive games.

1548
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
That's what the wallets say.

1549
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
I get where you're going with that

1550
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,000
but then once in a while,

1551
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:06,000
we have these like runaway fucking successes of the indie scene

1552
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,000
like Minecraft, like Stardew Valley.

1553
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:12,000
But to be fair, Minecraft is a game that is also online.

1554
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
This cup had come out recently and that sold really well.

1555
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Okay, fair enough.

1556
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,000
It's recent but people have been hyping that thing up forever.

1557
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:22,000
And once again, here's the thing about it.

1558
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Let me quickly finish Bobby's point, sorry.

1559
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Andy is saying that's what the wallets are saying.

1560
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Wallets are voting for Games as a Service plus loot boxes.

1561
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:33,000
And to be fair, and this is a point that is hard to dispute,

1562
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:38,000
the top games played on Steam were PUBG, as I call it,

1563
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
or Player Unknown Battleground, and Dota.

1564
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:44,000
We did vote with our wallets. We voted for this.

1565
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Sorry, Loki. You want to finish your thought?

1566
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,000
I definitely want to ask Jamie a different spin on this question.

1567
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Yeah, but they haven't always had loot boxes in PUBG to begin with.

1568
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Dota, that's a free-to-play game.

1569
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:58,000
So, I mean, once again, free-to-play.

1570
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:01,000
I don't really have a problem if you have loot boxes in a free-to-play game

1571
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
because I didn't pay for the game.

1572
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
So if I put money down for that, it's not a big deal

1573
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
because it's like making a purchase for the game.

1574
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,000
I have a problem when I drop $60 or something

1575
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
and then they want more money on top of it

1576
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
to get the full game and to get all this other crap.

1577
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:18,000
So that's my problem because that's the double dipping that you see there.

1578
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,000
And as far as indie games not selling as much, they don't have to

1579
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
because, once again, they're an indie studio.

1580
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,000
They don't need to make as much money

1581
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,000
because they didn't put as much of a budget into it.

1582
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,000
That's what I'm saying.

1583
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
You don't need to recoup as much money

1584
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
if you don't put as much money into it.

1585
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
And you can still come up with a quality game.

1586
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,000
There's a lot of really high-quality looking indie games

1587
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:42,000
and they don't have to sell 7 million copies to make their money back.

1588
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Jamie, I want to ask you this question

1589
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,000
because I know when it comes to a lot of the newer stuff

1590
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:50,000
that's not really your bread and butter.

1591
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
You really enjoy the classic games.

1592
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:55,000
There are newer things that I know you enjoy like Danganronpa and things,

1593
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
but those aren't necessarily the AAA titles either.

1594
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:00,000
So let me ask you... Well, not here.

1595
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,000
So let me ask you this because you're obviously listening to a lot of this

1596
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:08,000
and this whole thing and although I know you don't really care about Destiny so much

1597
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,000
and some of these things, let me ask you this question.

1598
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:14,000
When you think about the future of the gaming industry

1599
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
and hearing a lot of this that's going on

1600
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:19,000
and knowing about what's going on, the loot bosses and stuff,

1601
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
when you think about the future of the gaming industry,

1602
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:25,000
are you hopeful or are you scared?

1603
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:30,000
I wouldn't say I was scared. I'm a bit apprehensive.

1604
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:36,000
More or less that it's just more and more how the big title games

1605
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
are not going to be what draws my attention.

1606
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:42,000
The more hype something is, the more suspect I am of it.

1607
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:48,000
So I think though that as long as the indie development scene stays strong

1608
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:51,000
and that most of these people can actually stay independent

1609
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
and do things for the passion of the games,

1610
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:56,000
then I feel good about that part of it.

1611
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:59,000
But the big title stuff, I'll be honest,

1612
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:02,000
I'm not interested in being a part of that machine.

1613
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Mass Effect aside.

1614
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
And Dragon Ball.

1615
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Well, even with Mass Effect, because the chat room is obviously very tongue-in-cheek

1616
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
saying, but Mass Effect and so forth,

1617
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
okay, well, there's always exceptions to every rule, right?

1618
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
So Dark Saga has Mass Effect.

1619
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Even with Mass Effect, fans are really hurt by what the machine did to Andromeda.

1620
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:25,000
Yeah, I'm not going to buy Anthem. It's not getting my money.

1621
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:29,000
I refuse because of how Mass Effect was treated.

1622
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:33,000
And some people would say that's apples and oranges type of thing.

1623
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:37,000
But in a way, it's kind of interesting because you saying that

1624
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:44,000
is similar to how he says, I don't trust Activision to not implement this.

1625
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Just like this would be why I'd be worrying about BioWare

1626
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
because I don't trust EA.

1627
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Look at Visceral. Look at all the other companies they've shut down

1628
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
because of this kind of bullshit.

1629
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:57,000
BioWare, their clock is ticking, sadly.

1630
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:01,000
I do want to transition to another news story here and move on with our show.

1631
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:04,000
But let me try to end, because the chat is very debating right now,

1632
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
and it's great. I think these healthy debates are good.

1633
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,000
But let me try to end on a positive note here.

1634
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
What can EA Activision,

1635
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:16,000
what can these larger third-party developers do to make you happy?

1636
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
I guess for lack of a better term.

1637
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Keep their fucking fingers out of the franchises we love.

1638
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
Stop trying to double dip on this shit.

1639
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Remember, they fucking pulled this stupid online pass bullshit not too long ago.

1640
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Remember, this is the same companies that did this kind of crap

1641
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
because they needed this extra money, they claim.

1642
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Or it was a way to pirate used game sales.

1643
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:41,000
All these excuses that they say that their games are not successful.

1644
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Their games are successful. They're making billions of fucking dollars a year.

1645
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:49,000
So don't give me this bullshit that you're not making enough money.

1646
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
They're making enough money. They just want more of it.

1647
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:54,000
Because why? Why not? You always want more money.

1648
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:58,000
But at what expense? You're going to basically sell out your user base.

1649
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:02,000
And granted, there's people like, for example, Madden or FIFA

1650
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:05,000
that buy the game each year because they're fans of that franchise.

1651
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:09,000
They love the franchise and they'll keep buying it because they support that franchise.

1652
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:15,000
But they're using that dedication to this franchise to shove this stuff in

1653
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:18,000
because they're doing it a little bit at a time.

1654
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:22,000
So that, you know, it's, oh, this is kind of a minor irritation.

1655
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
But I love the game, I'm going to keep playing.

1656
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Oh, but they're adding something else this year.

1657
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:30,000
Oh, okay, well, they're going to keep slowly integrating that stuff in there

1658
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:34,000
until it finally becomes this mobile market almost.

1659
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:38,000
And that's not good. And the problem is people being dedicated to this

1660
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,000
are not really taking a stand to, you know, fight off the stuff.

1661
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Because they're like, well, remember the whole Call of Duty thing?

1662
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Like the non-dedicated servers and stuff like that.

1663
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Oh, man, I'm not buying Call of Duty this year. I'm boycotting it.

1664
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
We're going to create this Steam group to boycott it.

1665
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
And then everybody bought it.

1666
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:57,000
It's just if you're going to actually put your foot down and not buy something,

1667
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
you have to follow through with that.

1668
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:02,000
And the problem is it's going to take a lot of people to do that.

1669
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:05,000
And we've seen this already with some of the stuff where they have kind of

1670
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:09,000
backed off of things because of, you know, the backlash from it.

1671
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:12,000
I want to say Star Wars did that for a little bit.

1672
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:15,000
The Battlefront II stuff, they've kind of backed off a little bit on that,

1673
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
but not entirely.

1674
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:23,000
So it's just going to be, I don't know, it's just going to be seen.

1675
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
They're going to emulate what's going to sell well.

1676
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:28,000
So if single player games are selling well, they're going to put out single player games.

1677
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:32,000
If MMOs and Destiny, or if Overwatch is selling well, which it is,

1678
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
they're going to make games like Overwatch.

1679
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
They're just monkey see, monkey do.

1680
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Here's my hot take. Take it or leave it.

1681
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:45,000
My suggestion to these companies would be what can you do for less money?

1682
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:49,000
And I know that seems like a loaded question, but hear me out here.

1683
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Because instead of, and I don't mean to get games that are made on a cheaper budget,

1684
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,000
I don't mean acquiring indies and things like that.

1685
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:02,000
I mean using your talent and your resources that you already have.

1686
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:06,000
What can you do for less money once in a while?

1687
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
You don't necessarily have to do every game for less money.

1688
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,000
Let me use Hollywood as an example.

1689
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:17,000
I mean, after all, many of us kind of view the similarities in games and movies all the time.

1690
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:24,000
So for example, I guess what I'm saying is not every video game has to be Titanic.

1691
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Obviously, Titanic was one of the biggest movies of all time.

1692
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:29,000
At the time it was released, the biggest movie of all time,

1693
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:33,000
but it also had a very big budget to go with it, right?

1694
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:37,000
But I believe it was the same year or the year after Titanic came out,

1695
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:42,000
there was another movie that actually, for its return on investment,

1696
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:50,000
made more money based off of its budget than Titanic, basically,

1697
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
when you break it down to percentages.

1698
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
And it was a little comedy called There's Something About Mary.

1699
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
You all remember that movie? Right?

1700
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,000
So that movie...

1701
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
That movie was fucking stupid.

1702
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:03,000
It was stupid, but many people saw it because it made them laugh.

1703
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:07,000
Or another example around the same time frame would be the Blair Witch Project,

1704
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:11,000
which also kind of had its issues, but was made dirt cheap,

1705
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
and then made a lot, a lot of money.

1706
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:16,000
But that was a little more about an indie or so on.

1707
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:21,000
So there's something about Mary example there is that that was still a big Hollywood studio,

1708
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:25,000
and they used some of their higher talent, Cameron Diaz, Ben Stiller,

1709
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:29,000
but they made a movie that was a little cheaper to make,

1710
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:32,000
and they made a great investment off of that game

1711
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:35,000
using resources that were within Hollywood and so forth.

1712
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:39,000
So I guess my point is, I understand that gamers want the big graphics,

1713
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:42,000
they want the big explosions, they want all of that,

1714
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
and that's cool to do one or two of those games a year,

1715
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:48,000
but does every game have to be that, or isn't there room for Mary?

1716
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Well, perfect example, they go back to the whole gaming industry about it too,

1717
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:55,000
and this is going to be another one, look at PUBG.

1718
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:59,000
PUBG doesn't have the greatest graphics in the world,

1719
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:02,000
it's all about the gameplay, that's what gamers care about.

1720
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Or fucking Minecraft.

1721
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Or does the game play well, that's what it matters.

1722
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:09,000
Like you could have a game like Battlefront, like Star Wars Battlefront,

1723
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
it looked fucking gorgeous.

1724
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Was the gameplay there? Not exactly.

1725
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
And the content was very limited as well,

1726
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:19,000
because they spent all this time making the game look so nice that

1727
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
they didn't put out any maps.

1728
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:24,000
So that's the problem, it's like you have a game like PUBG

1729
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:29,000
that's fucking running away, it's insane with the whole popularity and everything,

1730
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:32,000
the graphics aren't like the top notch, but you know what, it's cheap,

1731
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:35,000
it's functional, it works, it looks nice,

1732
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:39,000
it doesn't have to be like fucking cinematic or anything,

1733
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:42,000
but it's fun, and that's what's got people engaged, it's like gameplay.

1734
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,000
You can make the game look so fucking amazing, beautiful and everything,

1735
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:48,000
but it could play like absolute shit.

1736
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Like, I don't know, Mass Effect, the gameplay in the new Mass Effect,

1737
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:56,000
I mean the game looks nice, but maybe the gameplay wasn't all there.

1738
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
Actually the gameplay was pretty good.

1739
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Yeah, the gameplay was fine.

1740
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Fine, whatever, I don't play the game, so whatever.

1741
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
It suffered for other reasons, it's fine.

1742
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:08,000
My point is, there are games that they focus a lot on the graphics of the game

1743
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,000
and everything, when they really should be focusing on the gameplay,

1744
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
because that's what's really doing it.

1745
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:17,000
And much to the fact that you're talking about the Blair Witch project and stuff,

1746
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:21,000
studios saw that they can make a ton of money from these found footage.

1747
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:25,000
And that's what they're doing, because it's a technique that they found

1748
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:29,000
they can make a ton of bank on, and that's why they're doing microtransactions.

1749
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:33,000
But at the same time, that's also why everybody's doing Battle Royale.

1750
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
That's why, yes, exactly.

1751
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:40,000
And the industry will follow what's popular, regardless of how much money they dump into it,

1752
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:44,000
because I can tell you right now, they didn't dump that much money into PUBG,

1753
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,000
where they needed to sell 7 million copies to recoup their money.

1754
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
So that's the thing.

1755
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:53,000
You're going to see more games like that, because they need to emulate it,

1756
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:56,000
because they want to ride the coattails of that to make some money,

1757
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:59,000
because they think that's where people want to go.

1758
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
That's the type of games they want to play.

1759
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
It ends up being a fun game.

1760
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
You can make other fun games that are different concepts.

1761
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
You don't have to copy everything.

1762
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Really good discussion, you guys, for time.

1763
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
I'm going to move on, though.

1764
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
But if you want to elaborate, you have more thoughts on this,

1765
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
feel free to drop us a line at some point.

1766
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com,

1767
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:21,000
or maybe a little later in the show we'll have some time to take some calls.

1768
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:25,000
So let's move on for now, though, and talk a little bit about

1769
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:28,000
an interesting publishing move, I suppose,

1770
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:32,000
and an interesting headline that really will grab your attention.

1771
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Is Sony about to make Nintendo Switch games?

1772
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
Kind of, is the answer there.

1773
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:42,000
So here's what's going on, is that Sony, in a Japanese press release,

1774
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:46,000
announced a publishing label named Unties,

1775
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:50,000
which is trying to, I guess, find indie games,

1776
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:54,000
such as, I think, Tiny Metal is the first game they've teamed up with.

1777
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:57,000
They are going to release this game on PlayStation 4,

1778
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Nintendo Switch, and PC.

1779
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:04,000
You'll notice there's a company that's very absent from that,

1780
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:09,000
but to be fair, this is Japanese based and Microsoft is not a factor in Japan.

1781
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
That could be playing into it too.

1782
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Don't they have a portable console too?

1783
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:17,000
Not anymore.

1784
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:20,000
Are we talking about Vita, what?

1785
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:24,000
Good point. Anyway, the game is coming out on November 21st,

1786
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:28,000
and some other games that will be published by this company.

1787
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:33,000
Last Standard, and a tank game called Merkava Avalanche,

1788
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:36,000
which is only for PC right now.

1789
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
There's also a game called Demo Reborn

1790
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:42,000
that's headed for PlayStation VR as well as PC as well.

1791
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:47,000
So, anyway, it's interesting that this Sony arm is looking at publishing,

1792
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
not just on Sony platforms.

1793
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:52,000
I mean, I could go really old school and say,

1794
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:55,000
well, it's not the first time that Sony's worked with Nintendo

1795
01:25:55,000 --> 01:26:00,000
because one of my favorite games they ever did release on Super Nintendo

1796
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
was Equinox.

1797
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:05,000
And that was a Super Nintendo game that, when you boot it up,

1798
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:08,000
has Sony ImageSoft's logo in the beginning of it.

1799
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
And, of course, they originally collaborated with them to make the PlayStation.

1800
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Sure, sure, which, you know, we never have that.

1801
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,000
But anyway, obviously, that's old news at this point.

1802
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
You know, we're digging up shit from 20, 30 years ago.

1803
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:21,000
But it is interesting to see that Sony is kind of going,

1804
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:24,000
okay, well, if there's money to be made by doing this,

1805
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
then we're going to do it.

1806
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:29,000
But it's also, it's not really Sony's name.

1807
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:32,000
It's Sony owns this publishing arm,

1808
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:35,000
but it sounds like they can kind of work independently

1809
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:40,000
and maybe don't have to do everything 100% Sony.

1810
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
So, kind of interesting.

1811
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:47,000
Dark Tetsuya in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

1812
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:50,000
I think they also published the hook movie game.

1813
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:53,000
And actf says, Mickey Mania was published by Sony too.

1814
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
Yeah, I mean, back in the day, in the 8-bit and 16-bit,

1815
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:58,000
you know, before Sony, you know, like we said,

1816
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:01,000
attempted the PlayStation, and then they separated

1817
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
and went their own direction with it.

1818
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
And look where we are now.

1819
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
You know, before then, Sony was publishing games.

1820
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:10,000
But to be fair, it's a little apples and oranges

1821
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
versus what was happening in the 90s

1822
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
and what's happening today, especially now

1823
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
that we're throwing PC into the mix as well,

1824
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
which is, you know, a very wide open type of platform.

1825
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:22,000
So, anyway, it'd be interesting to see what develops from that.

1826
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:25,000
But at this time, you know, when you see a headline like that,

1827
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:29,000
don't fucking assume that, oh, Uncharted is going to come out

1828
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:32,000
on Nintendo Switch. No, no, no, no.

1829
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
It's not going to happen like that.

1830
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:37,000
Not for a good long time for some serious things

1831
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
to change in the industry first.

1832
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:42,000
Meanwhile, back to what's happening today.

1833
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Dark Sakura, you have something for us.

1834
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
Yeah, I'll keep it quick.

1835
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Pokemon Go, with their newest update,

1836
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:54,000
they put in something that detects apps that can be used for spoofing.

1837
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:58,000
Big anti-cheat protection that actually pops up a little window

1838
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:01,000
saying that, yeah, we detect this stuff, knock it off.

1839
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:06,000
But 20 minutes later, they already figured it out.

1840
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:10,000
So, they actually, as far as I can tell, took out that little pop-up now,

1841
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:15,000
I guess, until they can find another way to keep it from being circumvented.

1842
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:22,000
But, yeah, you know, they're trying, I think, to go the route of warning

1843
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
before going the full perma-ban.

1844
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:28,000
So, I don't know. I don't do that.

1845
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:31,000
I don't think it ruins the game because, honestly enough,

1846
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
it doesn't affect how I play it.

1847
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:36,000
So, I don't care what these other people do.

1848
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:39,000
I don't like the spoofing of the gems and all that.

1849
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
That kind of ruins it.

1850
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:42,000
I don't do gems, though.

1851
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
Really? Well, I do. So, I don't like it.

1852
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:47,000
And the spoofing really fucks up Ingress,

1853
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:50,000
and Ingress had its whole other set of drama this week,

1854
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:54,000
which, you know, not to get too far into that, Loki, you saw that one, right?

1855
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:58,000
Finally, the fucking receipts came out on why your Guardians went down on day 89.

1856
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
But, anyway, that's a whole other story.

1857
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,000
That wasn't spoofing, per se, but that was a whole other...

1858
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:04,000
It was.

1859
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
Yeah, it can be. Sometimes it is.

1860
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:11,000
It was in this case because it's closed unless they were doing some major trespassing.

1861
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,000
True, true.

1862
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Anyway, spoofing in GPS games is bad.

1863
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:21,000
But usually we're into, to Jamie's credit, where Pokémon kind of escapes this,

1864
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
is that for a lot of people, catching them all,

1865
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
it doesn't matter how other people catch them all.

1866
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:28,000
And if you do avoid the gym game, then the spoofing thing doesn't matter.

1867
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:32,000
But I think for the integrity of the game, it's probably for the best.

1868
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:36,000
Because if Niantic's going to continue to do these region exclusives

1869
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:40,000
for Pokémon like Farfetch'd, let's say,

1870
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:43,000
if it was open wide for people to be spoofing and stuff,

1871
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:46,000
then when they open up trading eventually,

1872
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:50,000
those regional exclusives are going to lose a lot of value, if that makes sense.

1873
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,000
Yeah.

1874
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:54,000
I appreciate them trying to do something.

1875
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:57,000
So all they're doing is just checking what the app name is,

1876
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
because that's kind of lame, because you can just rename your apps anyways,

1877
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:04,000
especially if you're running a system that's rooted to be able to spoof that stuff.

1878
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:08,000
I don't know if we necessarily know 100% of what they're doing,

1879
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,000
because some of it's kind of behind the scenes.

1880
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:12,000
I thought that they had better detection of that stuff on Ingress,

1881
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:15,000
but it seems like there's spoofers all over the place,

1882
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
so I don't understand why this is still such a problem.

1883
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:20,000
It's been getting better, and they're getting banned faster,

1884
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
but it's not fixed.

1885
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:25,000
Sounds like it's probably manual with them then.

1886
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Perhaps.

1887
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Manually detecting stuff.

1888
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,000
Perhaps.

1889
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:32,000
All right, well, one more story before we get to our classic game of the week,

1890
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:36,000
and it has to do with checking in on Microsoft and the Xbox

1891
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:39,000
and the original Xbox compatibility.

1892
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
Yes, it is still coming for 2017,

1893
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:45,000
and that's according to Phil Spencer over at Xbox.

1894
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:49,000
He says that people are going to talk about specifically

1895
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:52,000
how compatibility is going to work on Xbox One X,

1896
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:55,000
and I think people will find it pretty interesting.

1897
01:30:55,000 --> 01:31:00,000
But apparently there is a leak or something that made its way onto Reddit

1898
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:04,000
that there was some games that were actually listed for original Xbox titles,

1899
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:09,000
so people are anticipating that these games would actually make their way

1900
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
to the Xbox compatibility.

1901
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:14,000
We know about Crimson Skies, but also Fusion Frenzy,

1902
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Red Faction 2, Dead to Rights, and King of Fighters Neo Wave

1903
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:23,000
are all anticipated to be in that first Neo Wave,

1904
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
if you will, of Xbox compatible games.

1905
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:26,000
So that would be pretty cool.

1906
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:30,000
And I'm curious what he talks about with the Xbox One X doing it uniquely.

1907
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
I'm curious to see what that's going to entail.

1908
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Unfortunately, I don't own a lot of original Xbox games,

1909
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
and none of them were on that list,

1910
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
but I'll be curious to see what happens.

1911
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
All right.

1912
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
Well, let's take a trip down memory lane

1913
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:48,000
and visit some other classic games that you could play today

1914
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
if you just take a little damn effort.

1915
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Dark Soccer is going to step into the gaming vault

1916
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,000
and find a game that she thinks,

1917
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:58,000
hey, you brats should be checking out this game.

1918
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:03,000
Stop spoofing in Pokémon Go and stop opening loot boxes

1919
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:04,000
and play this instead.

1920
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
Dark Soccer, what's the classic in the league?

1921
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:10,000
Well, while I've been on my Irem kick lately,

1922
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
I decided to pick another Irem game,

1923
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:16,000
a different type of shooter that they did called Image Fight.

1924
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
Y'all remember that one?

1925
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
No, I never played it, to be honest.

1926
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:26,000
Image Fight came out in 1988, and it came out in arcade.

1927
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:30,000
It was also out on the NES, the PC Engine in Japan,

1928
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:34,000
the Sharp X68000, and the FM Towns,

1929
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:40,000
which I have covered the FM Towns for a previous system of the month.

1930
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:45,000
So basically, it is a horizontal shooter,

1931
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
although it's supposed to have, well,

1932
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:51,000
it does have actually a number of similarities with R-Type.

1933
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:56,000
You play a ship that actually ended up in R-Type Final

1934
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:59,000
called the OF-1 Daedalus,

1935
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:04,000
and then you basically just go around shooting shit.

1936
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:09,000
You get this thing called a pod,

1937
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:13,000
which is a small colored sphere that has gun barrels on it,

1938
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:17,000
kind of like an option in some of the Gradius games.

1939
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
But the pod will float beside you.

1940
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:23,000
You get a red pod that changes direction based on how you move the ship,

1941
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
so it can be aimed at other enemies,

1942
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:29,000
and then the blue pod, which will always point forward,

1943
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:33,000
but it's more powerful, just a little bit less versatile.

1944
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
You also get the pod shot,

1945
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:39,000
where your side pods can be launched at high speed,

1946
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:43,000
kind of like how you shoot the front shield in R-Type,

1947
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:47,000
and then it will circle back and come back to the ship.

1948
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:50,000
So you can use them like they're projectiles as well.

1949
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:53,000
So, like I said, it has quite a few things in common with R-Type.

1950
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:56,000
You also have different speed controls

1951
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:59,000
so that you can be a little bit more precise,

1952
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:04,000
and you have little transformations that will happen with the main ship,

1953
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:09,000
like the wings angling back down if you're going at higher speeds,

1954
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:13,000
and the thruster color of the ship changes.

1955
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:18,000
And you can use, basically when you make the change,

1956
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:21,000
the thrusters will shoot out a blue flame

1957
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:25,000
that you can use as a weapon to damage other enemies too.

1958
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
And then you get these things called forces.

1959
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:30,000
They're these little kind of butterfly-like things

1960
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
that attach to the front of the ship.

1961
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:36,000
They're very much like the force in R-Type,

1962
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:41,000
and they'll turn your blaster into a stronger laser.

1963
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:44,000
They're also a shield of sorts as well,

1964
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:47,000
but these can't be ejected,

1965
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:52,000
so you only can eject your pods like you could the force in R-Type.

1966
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:59,000
Once you have it attached, you can't pick up a new one,

1967
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
but you can get different ones,

1968
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:05,000
and the names of the various weapons actually come from R-Type finals,

1969
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:08,000
so it really has a lot.

1970
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
It's supposed to be a different universe,

1971
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
so it really does have a lot in common with R-Type.

1972
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
So as for those versions that came out,

1973
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:18,000
we had, of course, the NES version,

1974
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:21,000
and in Japan there was the PC Engine,

1975
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:25,000
Sharp X68000, and the FM Towns, which came out in 1990.

1976
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:30,000
The PC Engine version came out in Japan on Virtual Console,

1977
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:35,000
and then Image Fight was also released in Japan

1978
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:42,000
for PlayStation and Saturn with another game called X-Multiply,

1979
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:45,000
so it was released in a compilation there.

1980
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:50,000
There was a sequel called Image Fight 2 Operation Deep Striker,

1981
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:53,000
which just makes me laugh.

1982
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:56,000
It came out on PC Engine Super CD-ROM,

1983
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
which I kind of would like it,

1984
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:02,000
because I really only have two other arcade card games,

1985
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:05,000
although if somebody can get me a Duo RX,

1986
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:08,000
please let me know, because I want to use arcade card games.

1987
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:13,000
But it was also re-released for Virtual Console in Japan.

1988
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:17,000
And like I said, the ship from this game, the Daedalus,

1989
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:22,000
was part of the ship, so you could choose from an R-Type final,

1990
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:27,000
and it was called the OF Series.

1991
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
So there you go.

1992
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:36,000
And also, now this was referenced by the creator of Radiant Silver Gun,

1993
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:43,000
Iuchi Hiroshi, who said that Image Fight was the inspiration for Radiant Silver Gun.

1994
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:46,000
And Itagaki, you know, dead or alive guy,

1995
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:50,000
basically said that Image Fight is one of his favorite games.

1996
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
That's some big endorsements.

1997
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,000
Yeah.

1998
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:58,000
I hadn't played Image Fight since I was a kid,

1999
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
at least an early teenager.

2000
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:04,000
So remembering that this was another Irem game actually was kind of fun.

2001
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:08,000
So Image Fight's the classic game.

2002
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:12,000
All right. There it is, your classic game of the week, Image Fight.

2003
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,000
Check it out.

2004
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:14,000
And I have to admit, this is one.

2005
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
I didn't play a lot, a lot of shooter games, though,

2006
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:20,000
so I'm not surprised I missed this one, but this is one I've been learning about tonight.

2007
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
But some of our chatters were familiar with this.

2008
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
Dark Tetsuya saying, I played Image Fight, too.

2009
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:25,000
It's pretty great.

2010
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
It was emulated, but it was still pretty fun.

2011
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
Well, sometimes emulators are all you got,

2012
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
but do try to find the originals if you can.

2013
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:35,000
But seriously, if someone can get me a Duo RX on the cheap,

2014
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
I'm actually very serious about that.

2015
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:38,000
I know.

2016
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:41,000
You know, like maybe 100 instead of, you know, 250.

2017
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:42,000
Like, I found them.

2018
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
Jamie wants a Duo RX.

2019
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
It needs to be in the vault.

2020
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,000
All right.

2021
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Before we let you go, because I know, Jamie,

2022
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
you're not going to be able to join us for the second half tonight

2023
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:52,000
because you have other things to tend to,

2024
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:56,000
but did you want to quickly throw out your rapid fire stories before you go?

2025
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:57,000
Sure.

2026
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:58,000
I'll throw them up for you.

2027
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:59,000
Bah.

2028
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:00,000
Bleh.

2029
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:04,000
Anyway, Destiny 2 was going to have trials,

2030
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:08,000
and they've actually been pulled off.

2031
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:11,000
They've delayed them for two weeks because of a glitch

2032
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:18,000
that would put players out of bounds to hide using their emotes.

2033
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:21,000
So, yeah, that's been put aside.

2034
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:25,000
But the emote that they got you out of bounds of was the funniest part of that.

2035
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:27,000
Hmm.

2036
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:28,000
Which one was it?

2037
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:29,000
The silly walk.

2038
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:30,000
Oh, yeah.

2039
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,000
I'm looking at it now.

2040
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:35,000
Oh, it's totally Monty Python as well.

2041
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:36,000
That's great.

2042
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:40,000
And then two more characters released, well, sorry,

2043
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
announced for Dragon Ball FighterZ,

2044
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:45,000
which honestly enough kind of surprises me

2045
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:48,000
because I don't think they've been in any of the home fighting games

2046
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:52,000
or at least super playable,

2047
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:55,000
but it's Captain Ginyu, which would be fun.

2048
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:58,000
I mean, I wonder if he'll have the whole body swap thing.

2049
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
That would be really, really crazy if he did.

2050
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:04,000
And Napa, so there you go.

2051
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:05,000
New characters.

2052
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Yeah, but I have certain other characters that I'd like to see in it that are playable.

2053
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:13,000
Well, it's not over yet, so maybe you'll get that in a future week.

2054
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:18,000
I want them to put in some of the new characters from Dragon Ball Super.

2055
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:21,000
Like, I'd like to see Ribrianne in it

2056
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
because she's just absolutely hilarious.

2057
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:26,000
Total spoof character on the magical girl genre.

2058
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:31,000
And I want Caulifla, the other lady Saya Jean

2059
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
because she's kind of badass.

2060
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
Well, crossing my fingers and toes, you get what you want.

2061
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:38,000
I want to get what I want.

2062
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,000
Whatever, I do what I want.

2063
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:43,000
All right, Jamie, before you leave us tonight, your final thought, please.

2064
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:46,000
It doesn't matter how old you are, Halloween is for everybody.

2065
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
You can go trick-or-treating as an adult.

2066
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
Have a good costume.

2067
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
Yeah, you have to have a good costume.

2068
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:56,000
And donate your candy to children who are needy.

2069
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,000
All right.

2070
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
But save the good ones for yourself.

2071
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:03,000
All right, that's going to do it for the first part of our show,

2072
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:06,000
but we still have more to come, including your calls at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype,

2073
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
and we're going to get to your emails.

2074
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:09,000
We do have a couple of those tonight.

2075
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

2076
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
See, Jamie leaves early, so she makes me read them instead.

2077
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:14,000
No, I'm just kidding.

2078
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:17,000
But I'm looking forward to all that when we come back after a quick break

2079
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:20,000
with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

2080
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:30,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

2081
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:35,000
Live tonight with episode 705 of our show already in progress

2082
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:39,000
for this October 22nd, 2017.

2083
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
I can't believe it's almost Halloween.

2084
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
Man, how time flies.

2085
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:46,000
Jamie has left the building, but JD has his own mic now,

2086
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
so maybe you can hear from him a little more this segment.

2087
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,000
Let's hope.

2088
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:50,000
Let's hope.

2089
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
How are you doing over there, JD? Enjoying the show so far tonight?

2090
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:53,000
Yeah, it's been good.

2091
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:54,000
Good.

2092
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
So, hey, I thought the listeners would get a kick out of this

2093
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
because we went to the mall yesterday, and there's this new store there

2094
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:02,000
that I'd never seen before, and it was nothing but import candy.

2095
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:05,000
We haven't had a good OLR foodio segment tonight,

2096
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:10,000
so what kind of import candy did we get and eat?

2097
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:14,000
Because we're fat, but that's all right. I'm fat, not you.

2098
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:18,000
I mean, I am trying to lose weight, but...

2099
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
Well, that ain't gonna help.

2100
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:23,000
Yeah, we got matcha Kit Kats, the green tea flavor.

2101
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:24,000
Yeah.

2102
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:29,000
We got the, there was like a Mozart piano bar of chocolate.

2103
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
What does that even taste like? Did you eat it yet?

2104
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:34,000
I haven't opened it yet. I think it's marzipan, but I'll have to check.

2105
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:35,000
Yeah.

2106
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:36,000
Marzipan's good.

2107
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:41,000
Various Kit Kats that were Oreo or cookies and cream or peanut butter or something.

2108
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:45,000
Yeah, Kit Kats from, because this place not just had Japanese import candy,

2109
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
but it had from Great Britain.

2110
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:48,000
Yeah, it had European.

2111
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
Where Cadbury's really good.

2112
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:53,000
Right, so we checked the labels, and it wasn't Cadbury in the US,

2113
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
because that's owned by Hershey's or somebody.

2114
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:58,000
It was Cadbury UK, which is definitely better.

2115
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,000
Yeah.

2116
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
They had arrows. We didn't get any of them.

2117
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:04,000
No, because they didn't have the mint arrows, which is my favorite flavor.

2118
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
They didn't have the, like, regular generic chocolate ones.

2119
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
They even had pretty big Toblerones.

2120
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:09,000
Yeah.

2121
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:10,000
I don't know if it was a giant Toblerone, but...

2122
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
Whereas, it's funny, because I can just imagine,

2123
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
like, we have some overseas listeners in the UK right now going,

2124
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
really? You guys, like, freak out about that?

2125
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
But we don't, we never see it here.

2126
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:22,000
It would be like if I sent you pumpkin pie pop tarts,

2127
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:25,000
which is like, it's what they have at Target right now.

2128
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:26,000
You can get that anyway.

2129
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:29,000
Or what's the candy they don't get overseas?

2130
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:32,000
The Wonka candy, like, Laffy Taffy.

2131
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:33,000
Is that Wonka?

2132
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:36,000
Yeah, I think so. I think it's one of the earlier ones.

2133
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:40,000
The Gobstoppers, which are okay. I think they're nerds.

2134
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:41,000
Nerds are also, yeah.

2135
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
That's the big nerds. You don't get that overseas.

2136
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
They also had UK Smarties.

2137
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:48,000
Yeah. Which here, Smarties are, like, different.

2138
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
Little tiny chalky things, yeah.

2139
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:53,000
They're like chalky, tangy things, whereas it's like M&Ms.

2140
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
I think they're like our sweet tarts.

2141
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:56,000
Yeah.

2142
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:00,000
Oh, good question. William 2DS XL Face asks,

2143
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
did they have Stroopwafel?

2144
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
I didn't look for that, but Stroopwafel, like,

2145
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:07,000
Starbucks sells a knockoff Stroopwafel thing now.

2146
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
Like, those things are showing up everywhere.

2147
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:10,000
I don't think it's a grocery store now.

2148
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:11,000
I don't think it's a knockoff,

2149
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
because it's not like a trademark brand.

2150
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:14,000
Yeah.

2151
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
But yeah, we saw when we went to Starbucks yesterday.

2152
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:17,000
Waffle cookies.

2153
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
Somebody was eating a Stroopwafel, so.

2154
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:22,000
And then William also asks, what about Kinder eggs?

2155
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
I didn't even think to look for those, but I think-

2156
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
I thought they don't sell those anymore.

2157
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:27,000
Yeah, I think it's still-

2158
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:28,000
I think they're still illegal.

2159
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
It's still illegal to sell those here, I think,

2160
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:33,000
because it is still a store in the U.S.,

2161
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
so I don't think you can technically sell those.

2162
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:36,000
Right.

2163
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:37,000
Yeah, so I didn't see those.

2164
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:40,000
I heard they were supposed to release Kinder eggs in the U.S.,

2165
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
but they were gonna be different where, like,

2166
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:45,000
the shell was wrapped, and you had to open that,

2167
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
and then, I don't know how-

2168
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:48,000
Yeah.

2169
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:49,000
It was gonna- Italian wasn't even the same thing.

2170
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:52,000
They were gonna, like, make it idiot-proof or something.

2171
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:53,000
Yeah.

2172
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:56,000
Yeah, basically, like, you tear apart the two halves of the shell,

2173
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
and it's two individually wrapped pieces of candy.

2174
01:43:58,000 --> 01:43:59,000
Which is not the same thing.

2175
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
Yeah, it's not the same thing. It's really not.

2176
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:04,000
Anyway, there you go, your little candy break here at OLR.

2177
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
Now that I've given you all a sweet tooth,

2178
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:09,000
let's get into some rapid-fire news, Loki.

2179
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:12,000
So, this is very exciting, but one of the-

2180
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
one of my favorite games to play in the arcade

2181
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:18,000
used to be the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle 4-player arcade cabinet, and-

2182
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:19,000
Who didn't like that game?

2183
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:20,000
Yeah, exactly.

2184
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:21,000
Who didn't like that game?

2185
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:22,000
Who doesn't like that?

2186
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:23,000
Except for the fact that it would, like,

2187
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
go through your entire roll of quarters.

2188
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:28,000
Right. Well, that opportunity may present itself again,

2189
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:29,000
because guess what?

2190
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:34,000
Raw Thrills is making a brand new TMNT 4-player arcade cabinet

2191
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:37,000
based off of the new- of the Nickelodeon show.

2192
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:42,000
So, it's gonna be four players with a giant 55-inch HD screen.

2193
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:46,000
Doesn't Raw Thrills do all those ticket spinner games, though?

2194
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:49,000
And there are redemption options, so you can spit-

2195
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
well, you can spit tickets, but it's an option.

2196
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:52,000
You don't need to do that.

2197
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
Isn't that weird, though?

2198
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:55,000
I mean, it's not weird.

2199
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:58,000
It's, like, one of those kind of obvious but sad things now,

2200
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
where it's like, in order to have an arcade game,

2201
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
it has to have a ticket option now,

2202
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
because that's what arcades are.

2203
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:05,000
Yeah.

2204
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
It was like, JD and I went to the casino here locally,

2205
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
because JD had never been to a casino-

2206
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
well, since you were 21 and not been to a casino.

2207
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:12,000
Yeah.

2208
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:13,000
So, I was like, let's go gamble.

2209
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:16,000
So, we went to one of the local casinos here,

2210
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:19,000
which, you know, they have on Native American land,

2211
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:20,000
they are allowed to build casinos.

2212
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:23,000
That's why we have some casinos in California, but not a lot.

2213
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:26,000
So, we went to a local place of the freeway here, Red Hawk,

2214
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:29,000
which we picked because it's closest,

2215
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:30,000
but you asked, you were like,

2216
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
oh, should we go to the arcade?

2217
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:33,000
And you're probably thinking, like,

2218
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
oh, they probably got DDR and all that stuff there.

2219
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:38,000
And I'm like, it's going to be a bunch of nothing but ticket spitters.

2220
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
Like, it is not- if you want to go play DDR,

2221
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
you got to go to round one or something, you know?

2222
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:43,000
I was going to say, like-

2223
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:44,000
Or Dave & Buster's, at least.

2224
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
I'd heard decent things about casino arcades in Reno,

2225
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:49,000
but, like, Reno is more of a big gambling thing than-

2226
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:52,000
I used to go to the Circus Circus arcade all the time in Reno.

2227
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
I think they closed, didn't they?

2228
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:55,000
No, I don't know.

2229
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:56,000
Circus Circus is still going in Reno.

2230
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
You know, I was thinking the Sahara.

2231
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
Yeah, oh, no, the Sahara's in Vegas.

2232
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:03,000
Right, right.

2233
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:04,000
Yes, it closed.

2234
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
But the Sahara's going to reopen with a new name,

2235
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
and I think they probably renovated the building.

2236
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:09,000
That's all Vegas.

2237
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:10,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2238
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:11,000
But Vegas, you have other options.

2239
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
Like, you can go to the Pinball Museum in Vegas.

2240
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
Of course, there's a Pinball Museum in the Bay Area, too, if I remember right.

2241
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:16,000
It's in Alameda.

2242
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:17,000
Yeah.

2243
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
So, and I talked a couple weeks ago.

2244
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
We went on that random jaunt over to Oakland

2245
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:24,000
and went to that- I can't remember the name of it now.

2246
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:25,000
It wasn't a museum, but it was a-

2247
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
The Video Game History Museum.

2248
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:28,000
Oh, it was a museum.

2249
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:29,000
Okay, Video Game History Museum.

2250
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:30,000
So, it was fun.

2251
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:35,000
Anyway, sorry we talked about museums as a tangent from your Ninja Turtles game,

2252
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:39,000
but maybe the old Ninja Turtles game will turn up in a museum someday.

2253
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:40,000
It belongs in a museum.

2254
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:41,000
It does.

2255
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:42,000
It's my childhood right there.

2256
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:45,000
Just put a full round table pizza with that in a museum.

2257
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
Well, anyways, they're showing this off.

2258
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:50,000
It's going to be at the IAPA.

2259
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:54,000
So, looks neat.

2260
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:58,000
I mean, just trying to kind of peek at the screenshot there.

2261
01:46:58,000 --> 01:46:59,000
I mean, it looks pretty.

2262
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
I hope a game like that does end up coming to consoles,

2263
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:06,000
because, shit, modern arcades aren't really running on proprietary hardware anymore.

2264
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:07,000
It's pretty much all PCs.

2265
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:08,000
Right.

2266
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:09,000
Right.

2267
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:10,000
I don't know.

2268
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:11,000
I want to see that.

2269
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:12,000
I definitely will check it out and play it.

2270
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
If I ever get around to an arcade, it has it.

2271
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:15,000
So, pretty awesome.

2272
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:21,000
And then, speaking of cool games, they've got some mini games

2273
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:24,000
that are within the new Resident Evil Revelation games

2274
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
that are being ported over the Switch.

2275
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:29,000
So, the Switch versions of Resident Evil Revelations 1 and 2

2276
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:32,000
will have a new raid mode in it,

2277
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:36,000
and each of those are going to have kind of a special mini game.

2278
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:39,000
So, the first one in Revelations 1 is going to be Ghost Ship Panic,

2279
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
and it's like a vertical shooter.

2280
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:46,000
And then, they also have, in the second one,

2281
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:49,000
they're going to have Ghouls and Homunculi,

2282
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:54,000
which is kind of a spoof of Ghosts and Goblins.

2283
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
So, that's pretty awesome.

2284
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:57,000
Oh, I see.

2285
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:58,000
So, they're, like, spoofing their own games.

2286
01:47:58,000 --> 01:47:59,000
Yeah, because it's Capcom.

2287
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:00,000
Cute.

2288
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:01,000
They can do that.

2289
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:02,000
Of course.

2290
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:03,000
If you're interested in checking those out,

2291
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
they'll be coming out on the Switch on November 28th.

2292
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:06,000
Dartusuya says,

2293
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
I saw some video of those modes.

2294
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:09,000
The Ghost Ship one looked okay,

2295
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:12,000
but the Ghost and Goblins knockoff sounded neat.

2296
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:13,000
So, yeah.

2297
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:14,000
All right.

2298
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:19,000
Moving over to a possible new release on the Nintendo Switch from Ubisoft.

2299
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:23,000
Uno is a game that they're looking at releasing on the Nintendo Switch.

2300
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:26,000
Apparently, this is through a recent PEGI rating,

2301
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:29,000
which is, you know, one of the ratings boards overseas.

2302
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:33,000
That is something that looks like it's been rated recently.

2303
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
However, there's been no official announcement,

2304
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
but it does make a lot of sense

2305
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:40,000
that a game like Uno would come out for the Nintendo Switch.

2306
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
I can't help but think back to the days

2307
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:48,000
of when Uno was, like, the reason to own an Xbox camera

2308
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:49,000
and you could play online.

2309
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:50,000
Remember?

2310
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:51,000
Yeah.

2311
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
Some of our old in-jokes, like, draw four, bitch,

2312
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
from Uno and the webcam.

2313
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:59,000
Who knew that that is how gaming would just turn into for everything?

2314
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:00,000
Mm-hmm.

2315
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:04,000
Anyhow, enjoy Uno,

2316
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
but try to turn it down a little bit.

2317
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
Well, actually, you won't be able to yell and scream at video

2318
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:11,000
and show nudes on video chat because it's the Nintendo Switch.

2319
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
And as we talked about earlier, Nintendo doesn't know how to handle it.

2320
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:14,000
No fun allowed.

2321
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:15,000
No fun allowed?

2322
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:16,000
Come on.

2323
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:17,000
All right.

2324
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
But will the Switch app be enabled for it?

2325
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
Because that's how you have to do the headset thing for Splatoon.

2326
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:22,000
Yeah, but, you know...

2327
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
It's only if they turn it on.

2328
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
If a tree falls in the woods, does anybody hear it?

2329
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:27,000
Like, you know, they could enable it.

2330
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:28,000
Nobody's going to use it.

2331
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
Do people use it on Splatoon?

2332
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
I have never used that app for anything.

2333
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
Ryan and I tried to last night, but it was just...

2334
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
We found out that you have to actually create a private room.

2335
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
You can't just do the join a friend thing.

2336
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:41,000
So you have to, like, do a lot of preparation in order to actually use the voice chat.

2337
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:42,000
I'm...

2338
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:43,000
I can see my brain.

2339
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
I just rolled my eyes so fucking hard.

2340
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:46,000
Like...

2341
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
Just delete it.

2342
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:52,000
No, don't delete it because you can still get equipment using the Splatoon app.

2343
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
But you just don't use it for chat.

2344
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
Delete your account.

2345
01:49:58,000 --> 01:49:59,000
All right.

2346
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:00,000
Moving on.

2347
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:03,000
Pokemon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon.

2348
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:07,000
Ultra Moon are games I'm sure you're looking forward to, all you Pokey people out there.

2349
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
Which is a lot of you because these games are huge.

2350
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:18,000
It has been confirmed this week that Pokemon Ultra Sun and Moon are the last core title games for the 3DS.

2351
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:21,000
Of course, we know that Pokemon will be coming out on the Switch.

2352
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:25,000
They made that announcement that there will be a core game in the Pokemon universe on the Switch.

2353
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:31,000
I'm assuming next year, but that is still an assumption until Nintendo and the Pokemon company confirm that.

2354
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:39,000
But Ultra Sun and Moon will be the last core title for the 3DS because it is pushing the, quote, absolute limits of the system.

2355
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:43,000
That's coming from Game Freak director Shigeru Omori.

2356
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:49,000
That, I guess, the 3DS system was completely redesigned when Sun and Moon was being developed.

2357
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:53,000
And they pushed that new system even further to what we thought was the most we could draw from it.

2358
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:59,000
With Ultra Sun and Moon, we've tried to take that out more and really, really push the system to its absolute limits.

2359
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:03,000
We're now feeling that perhaps this is the maximum of what we can get out.

2360
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:07,000
So maybe, now Nintendo will let the 3DS fucking die.

2361
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:11,000
Are Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon new 3DS exclusives, or do they still work on the old one?

2362
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:14,000
As far as I know, they still work on the old one.

2363
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:18,000
Because Nintendo could still get a lot of mileage out of making new 3DS exclusive titles.

2364
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:23,000
Like, the backwards compatibility is a problem, but the hardware issue...

2365
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:28,000
I don't think that would be a wise move when the Switch is also out there trying to sell stuff.

2366
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:33,000
I think they need to make a game for what people have and try to sell Switches for next year's game.

2367
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:36,000
Sure, but we also thought the 3DS would stop getting new games when the Switch came out.

2368
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:41,000
Fair point, fair point. And now here we go with this Pokémon game this year and Metroid.

2369
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:47,000
But like I said, now if Pokémon is officially done on the 3DS, now maybe the 3DS can finally fucking die.

2370
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:50,000
I just don't understand why they couldn't put them out on both platforms.

2371
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:53,000
Why can't they put the Metroid game out on the Switch?

2372
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:57,000
That's a great question. Maybe it will later, who knows?

2373
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
On Virtual Console.

2374
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:06,000
Alright, there you go. So that is it for Rapid Fire News.

2375
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:09,000
Let's travel around and check out what's in stores this week.

2376
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Loki, let's start with the US.

2377
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:14,000
Quite a bit. So we've got Destiny 2 coming out on PC.

2378
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:17,000
Hidden Agenda on PlayStation 4.

2379
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:26,000
Just Dance 2018 on PC, the Switch, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, the Wii, and the Wii U.

2380
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:30,000
They're still making Wii games. The original Wii.

2381
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:33,000
Wait, Just Dance is coming out on the original Wii?

2382
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:34,000
The original Wii.

2383
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:41,000
Well, there's probably houses like yours that only had a Wii for the longest time and still never upgraded.

2384
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:45,000
It just better not have any DLC because in a couple months you can't even do it.

2385
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:49,000
I think everything is app-based now or something like that, isn't it?

2386
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:53,000
Yeah, but what they did with the Wii previously is any indication.

2387
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:58,000
They're just going to kill all the internet usage for it because a lot of the Wii channels don't work anymore.

2388
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
Rest in peace. Rest in Wii.

2389
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:04,000
Alright, traveling over to...

2390
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:05,000
Oh, hold on.

2391
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:06,000
Oh, I thought we were done.

2392
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
No. Oh, we have a ton. I'm sorry.

2393
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:14,000
Knights of Azure 2, Bride of the New Moon on PC, the Switch, and PlayStation 4.

2394
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:17,000
This is the police for the Switch.

2395
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:19,000
Okay.

2396
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:24,000
Yomawari Midnight Shadows on PC, PlayStation 4, and the Vita.

2397
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:29,000
Coloons Gate VR Suzaku on PlayStation VR.

2398
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:34,000
We have Taiko Drum Master Drum Sessions on PlayStation 4.

2399
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:39,000
Assassin's Creed Origins on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

2400
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
Super Mario Odyssey on the Switch.

2401
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:48,000
Wolfenstein 2 The New Colossus on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

2402
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:50,000
That's it.

2403
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:51,000
Are you sure? You're done?

2404
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:52,000
I'm done.

2405
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:53,000
You're done. Alright.

2406
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
Traveling over to Japan. It's a busy week over there as well.

2407
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:58,000
Taiko no Tatsujin gets its release over there as well.

2408
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:03,000
It's Taiko-ton Tatsujin Session de Dodon Gagdon comes out this week.

2409
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:10,000
There's a regular edition of that and you can get some different versions with titles and I think a controller for that as well.

2410
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
You can also check out in Japan this week.

2411
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:15,000
Ark Survival Evolved gets its Japanese release this week.

2412
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:24,000
Amikata wa Kanojo Narimi comes out this week, which I am not sure what this game is.

2413
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:29,000
It looks like it's another one of those sim games featuring anime babes.

2414
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
That's what it just kind of looks like for the screenshots I'm looking at.

2415
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:34,000
It's probably a... what do they call those? I don't know.

2416
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:40,000
Then we also have a game called Sengo Muramasa DX Guren no Ketu comes out this week as well.

2417
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:48,000
And this is a game that looks like it's probably a little more strategy based because I can see the battlefield here with the hexagon shapes and so forth.

2418
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:51,000
But with anime cutscenes. So there's that as well.

2419
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:58,000
And then if you are so inclined you can also get a new gaming monitor of sorts that's coming off the Playstation 4.

2420
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:01,000
But that's a HORI release. That's not an official Sony release.

2421
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:05,000
Otherwise, one more set here.

2422
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:15,000
Yahari Game Ore no Seishun Love Kome wa Mashigateru and Zoku Omitome set.

2423
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:20,000
I think that is some type of like learn to speak type of thing is coming out there.

2424
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
So that is also available in Japan.

2425
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
Let's see, checking other systems here.

2426
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:29,000
Including the Vita, which yes, still gets releases.

2427
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:33,000
Including price reductions on games like Sword Art Online and Shin Gundamusou.

2428
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:38,000
Also we have Steam Prison Nanatsu no Bitoku coming out this week.

2429
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:43,000
And that Sengo Muramasa DX game is out on the Vita as well.

2430
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:48,000
And I just closed my site so I missed if there was anything on the Nintendo Switch.

2431
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:52,000
But I'm going to look right now and I want to look at the 3DS as well.

2432
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:56,000
On the Nintendo Switch this week in Japan we also have Super Mario Odyssey of course.

2433
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:57,000
They've got to get that game as well.

2434
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:00,000
And that is the big release on the Switch this week.

2435
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
Probably meaning there's nothing on the 3DS this week.

2436
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
Oh no I lied, there is an idle game.

2437
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:08,000
Idle Time Priipada Yume All-Star is out this week.

2438
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:13,000
As is Rune Factory 4 Platinum Collection is out on the 3DS this week.

2439
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:14,000
Busy week!

2440
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:17,000
Was anybody able to pull UK releases?

2441
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:18,000
I know you were trying to hunt around for them JD.

2442
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:21,000
But did you, Loki you have them by chance?

2443
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:22,000
Yeah I can do it real quick.

2444
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:23,000
Awesome.

2445
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
We don't want to neglect our friends over there just because Jamie's gone.

2446
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:27,000
Okay I guess we can.

2447
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:35,000
So starting off this week we've got, let's see, Bury My Love on iOS.

2448
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:39,000
Just Dance 2018 on everything as before.

2449
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:42,000
Knights of Azure 2, Bride of the New Moon.

2450
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:47,000
And Sword Art Online, Hollow Realization Deluxe.

2451
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:53,000
Wolfenstein 2 the New Colossus on Playstation 4 and PC and Xbox One.

2452
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:59,000
And that's just it.

2453
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:03,000
It looks like, I don't know why they have Just Dance 2017 listed on here as well.

2454
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:04,000
That is not correct.

2455
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
That came out last year.

2456
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
Maybe he gets a big price reduction, who knows.

2457
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:11,000
Yeah so I'm not gonna, I'm gonna ignore all these other ones here.

2458
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:12,000
Fair enough.

2459
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:13,000
Alright let's go to the mailbag.

2460
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:22,000
You send us emails.

2461
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:23,000
Oh I'm sorry there's one more.

2462
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
God damn it Loki.

2463
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
SingStar Celebration on Playstation 4.

2464
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:28,000
It's important.

2465
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:29,000
Wait there's a new SingStar game?

2466
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:30,000
Apparently.

2467
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:31,000
Ooh.

2468
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:32,000
That's weird.

2469
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:33,000
Alright well.

2470
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
They stopped doing them in the US, they do them in Europe because that's where their

2471
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:36,000
audience is.

2472
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:37,000
I know that's where people actually buy them.

2473
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:38,000
Yeah.

2474
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:39,000
I like SingStar.

2475
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:44,000
One of my friends still does every year for Halloween, pumpkin carving and SingStar.

2476
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:49,000
But since they've basically killed off SingStar support in the US it's gotten more and more

2477
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:50,000
sad.

2478
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:51,000
Oh can you not even download SingStar stuff anymore?

2479
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:57,000
He can but well for one he has a PS3 and not a PS4 and there's some differences in licensing

2480
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:58,000
and it's really weird.

2481
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:02,000
But it's also like the, they've removed a lot of the licenses in the past year.

2482
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:06,000
I guess the contract expired because you know how songs are in music games.

2483
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:09,000
And they are really really slow at releasing new stuff.

2484
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:12,000
And a lot of stuff was only available in Europe anyway.

2485
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:17,000
Like there was like an erasure song, like the robot unicorn attack song.

2486
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:18,000
Always.

2487
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
It was only available in Europe anyway.

2488
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:21,000
So it's very sad.

2489
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:26,000
I'll have my, I'll have my SingStar ABBA and you can take that from my cold dead hands.

2490
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
Well it's on a disc so it's gonna work forever.

2491
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:29,000
Work forever.

2492
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:30,000
You're damn right.

2493
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:31,000
We'll put that on the TV somewhere.

2494
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
Alright let's get to the emails.

2495
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:36,000
Participate at orangelandrater.com is the place to send us an email.

2496
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:41,000
If you would like us to read your email just like I'm going to tonight for three emails.

2497
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:42,000
It's a busy week.

2498
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:43,000
Three emails.

2499
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:48,000
First one tonight from Martin the Belgian who emails us tonight and says hello OLR.

2500
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:51,000
I wanted to chime in on your discussion regarding loot boxes.

2501
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:58,000
The root of the discussion is really that game publishers want more money out of you than the $60 you paid for a full game.

2502
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
Take EA and Battlefront.

2503
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:06,000
Battlefront 1 had only five maps and the rest was behind a season pass paywall that was another $50.

2504
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
There were no paid loot boxes.

2505
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:11,000
The community was outraged because of the lack of maps in a full price game.

2506
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:16,000
EA was proud to announce that Battlefront 2 has more maps and no season pass.

2507
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:22,000
Now however they've put some in game progression and boost items inside of loot boxes you can buy with real money.

2508
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:26,000
You can earn them in game but this takes so long that you'll eventually want to buy them.

2509
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:27,000
It's now a pay to win game.

2510
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:31,000
In both cases they just want more money out of the average player than $60.

2511
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
Is this justified?

2512
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:34,000
Let us be honest.

2513
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:38,000
The price of game development has gone up but the price of games has hardly gone up in decades.

2514
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:41,000
I already paid $50 for games in the late 90s.

2515
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:46,000
Personally I'd rather pay $80 for a full game without season pass and without loot boxes.

2516
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:49,000
I just hate getting half a game for $60.

2517
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:50,000
What do you guys think?

2518
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:53,000
Should the price of games just go up?

2519
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,000
Controversy.

2520
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:56,000
Good question.

2521
01:59:56,000 --> 02:00:00,000
I mean we've obviously talked a little bit about this already tonight.

2522
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:03,000
But I think Martin asks a very simple question.

2523
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:07,000
Would you be willing to just pay more money for a game if it means no more of this bullshit?

2524
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:10,000
No because they're still going to do this bullshit.

2525
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:15,000
You may think that doing a certain thing is going to cause them to not do something.

2526
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:16,000
That's not the case at all.

2527
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
It never works that way.

2528
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:19,000
Never.

2529
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:22,000
You allow them to do something like raise the price of a game.

2530
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
Everybody's going to do that now.

2531
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:27,000
And they're still going to have this bullshit because it's never going to be enough.

2532
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
I'm a little torn.

2533
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:36,000
I'm open to the idea but I don't want $80 to be the fucking standard.

2534
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:43,000
$80 needs to be for a gold, no a fucking platinum fucking video game.

2535
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:44,000
But that's the problem though.

2536
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:53,000
These platinum quote unquote video games have like pre-order DLC that was supposed to be in the game in the first place.

2537
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
And so they're already doing that.

2538
02:00:55,000 --> 02:01:01,000
They're already piecing out a full game for $80 so you get the full experience because you want the full experience.

2539
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:04,000
So am I correct in hearing you say it doesn't matter they're already $80?

2540
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:05,000
They are already doing it.

2541
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:09,000
They're just doing it with clever marketing like the gold edition or stuff like that where you can buy a season.

2542
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:10,000
I mean look at this.

2543
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
That's season pass.

2544
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:13,000
Think of how ridiculous it is.

2545
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:17,000
You're pre-ordering DLC that's coming out.

2546
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:21,000
You're giving them money before the download content is available.

2547
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:31,000
I gave, you may not like this, I gave Activision $60 this week because I pre-purchased Destiny 2.

2548
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:34,000
So I have it installed and on my machine ready to go on Tuesday.

2549
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:35,000
Well that's fine though.

2550
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
The game is already developed.

2551
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:41,000
I'm talking about like pre-ordering content that they haven't even made yet.

2552
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,000
Like the Zelda season pass?

2553
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,000
Yes any season pass.

2554
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:52,000
Well I mean so to be fair if you activate the season pass in Breath of the Wild it actually does give you a couple of small things but it's just like a t-shirt.

2555
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:58,000
That's nice but like I think any season pass you know it's kind of lame because just purchase it when it comes out.

2556
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:02,000
Here's the thing too I think that's something serious to consider.

2557
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:06,000
You know Martin talking about should we just make the sticker price 80 bucks.

2558
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:12,000
It's going to get harder and harder to do shit like that when you have a game like Stardew Valley that's 15 bucks.

2559
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:18,000
And there's some really big experiences that are awesome gaming experiences that you can get for 20 bucks.

2560
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:26,000
Now granted I realize that a game like Stardew Valley especially the development is very very different than a game like I don't know Battlefront 2 or whatever.

2561
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:32,000
But that's you know again where I go back and I said earlier make more something about like PUBG.

2562
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:35,000
You know perfect example that's a 40 dollar game.

2563
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:38,000
You know granted they have loot boxes in there.

2564
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:42,000
I don't like it but it seems like it's more accessories and stuff like that.

2565
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:51,000
You know it's only costume DLC type stuff which a lot of people try to like put that out there is like okay that's all it is it's just you know cosmetic.

2566
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:54,000
But then they kind of it starts getting into other things.

2567
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:57,000
But right now it's only cosmetic as far as I'm aware.

2568
02:02:57,000 --> 02:03:05,000
So that's a game that's offering experience that people want for less than 60 dollars.

2569
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:06,000
So it can be done.

2570
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:12,000
It's just that they don't want to they want to push the graphics because it's the most gorgeous looking game ever.

2571
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:17,000
But would you rather have a really gorgeous looking game or game that's really good to play.

2572
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:28,000
Wasn't the whole objection people had to loot boxes is that it was basically gambling and people would spend a lot more than they would if they just you know like that's the whole thing it's hidden costs.

2573
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:36,000
So I mean it seems like a fair thing to say okay well we'll just bundle all of this in at a higher price like the game publisher is going to take a hit because they're not getting the gambling income.

2574
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:40,000
But like players can be like well I'm just going to plunk it all down at once.

2575
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:45,000
Yeah I mean I like knowing what I'm going to get better than fucking gambling.

2576
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:52,000
Basically I'd rather have DLC microtransactions where I know what I'm getting versus you know this loot box crap.

2577
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:56,000
And then on top of the loot box stuff they do all this like alternate currency stuff.

2578
02:03:56,000 --> 02:04:09,000
So oh I want that loot box but it's you know 800 of the micro credits or whatever but I can only purchase a pack of 750 or you know a one that's you know 15 dollars or something like that for something like that.

2579
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:15,000
It's like they do that shit on purpose because they want you to buy it and oh crap I have this stuff left over.

2580
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:23,000
Well I guess I better buy some more. It's all fucking manipulative bullshit and it's all done on purpose.

2581
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:35,000
Mega Man X400 in our chat says the loot boxes in Pugbee as I say I know it's PUBG but I like Pugbee are cosmetic but some of the cosmetic items are advantageous like camouflage clothing.

2582
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:41,000
So that's kind of where that game is at just if you were curious. Anyway Martin closes the email with this.

2583
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:49,000
Finally I don't mind purely cosmetic loot boxes and I don't mind season passes as long as the base game has plenty of content.

2584
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:54,000
Thanks as always and keep up the great show Martin the Belgian. Thanks for email Martin.

2585
02:04:54,000 --> 02:05:01,000
Like I think loot boxes are fine in the sense of like you know like an Overwatch or something like that where you kind of get it as a reward for playing the game.

2586
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:08,000
I like Heroes of the Storm a lot too and Heroes of the Storm there's a lot you can buy but Heroes of the Storm is fucking free. It's also a free game.

2587
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:17,000
So I mean you expect to get the more nickel and diming stuff and the whole the hot dogs of the price of the currency don't match the buns that cost loot boxes.

2588
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:18,000
Yeah no it does.

2589
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:28,000
But in a free game there's a lot more leeway for that because I have yet to spend a dollar on Heroes of the Storm and I've had a pretty decent experience so far.

2590
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:35,000
And I'm tempted to drop money in it just so I can unlock Ana and Junkrat some of the heroes I want to play and well kind of support it too.

2591
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:41,000
I mean I haven't really spent any money on heroes and I've played that's fine because that game didn't require you to pay $60.

2592
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:42,000
No it didn't.

2593
02:05:42,000 --> 02:06:00,000
As you know your ticket to get in so I'm fine with that it's just one year you're requesting me to put down $60 and another $30 for the gold edition and then you want me to buy the Seize the Path for $50 and then oh then you want some microtransactions and loot boxes in game.

2594
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:03,000
Come on that's ridiculous.

2595
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:12,000
Alright let's get to our next email from Ryan who emails us saying hey OLR love the show keep it up we will thank you.

2596
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:18,000
Just wondering what website do you guys use for the upcoming US releases thanks and stay awesome.

2597
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:27,000
You know it's a funny story because back when the show first started Loki was working in the distribution industry and so he would just use the fucking source.

2598
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,000
I would just be off memory.

2599
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:30,000
Yeah right.

2600
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:34,000
But what do you use now you're using wiki Wikipedia and that's not all that great.

2601
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:38,000
I used to use GameStop because they used to have a nice where you could sort by release date.

2602
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:41,000
They don't have that anymore because their site's fucking shit.

2603
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:44,000
So you use like wiki's 20s gaming.

2604
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:47,000
I use Wikipedia but it works entirely accurate.

2605
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:55,000
I've seen you kind of throw other stuff into like you're using Wikipedia but you read over here something else you kind of throw that into.

2606
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:59,000
Yeah they don't have everything because it's you know it's updated by individuals.

2607
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
They don't have all the indie stuff always right.

2608
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:03,000
You're never going to catch everything.

2609
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,000
Fuck who's going to keep track of all the indies are coming out.

2610
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:08,000
I mean it's dark to see you suggesting game facts.

2611
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
I thought game facts had a section for release date.

2612
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
Maybe I haven't checked it in a while.

2613
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:17,000
Maybe one more email from Ziba who emails us tonight.

2614
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:22,000
Hey guys sorry for the long email but I have a couple of things I wanted to talk about.

2615
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:23,000
Hey no problem.

2616
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:28,000
Last week when you guys announced that the classic game of the week was Terranigma it really wanted me.

2617
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:33,000
It really made me want to tell you a little story about how I first heard about the game.

2618
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:41,000
One day back in the early 2000s I was searching for information about emulating games and I came across a website called fantasyanime.com.

2619
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:45,000
This site is still around today but back then it was a very small yet informative.

2620
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:49,000
It showed information about a handful of the popular animes and RPGs.

2621
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:52,000
One of the RPGs was obviously Terranigma.

2622
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:57,000
As I read up on the game I quickly got interested in and wanted to try it out.

2623
02:07:57,000 --> 02:08:00,000
Now emulation wasn't that great back then.

2624
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:06,000
One emulator took up a lot of RAM while another one ran fine but couldn't emulate all of the effects and lighting.

2625
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:09,000
I became very frustrated that I couldn't fully experience the game.

2626
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:14,000
Since I knew Terranigma never came out in the US I was determined to find another way to play it.

2627
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:20,000
Upon researching more I found a site that showed how to mod American Super Nintendo consoles to play PAL European games.

2628
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:25,000
The vast diagrams and information was very hard for me to understand and I knew I couldn't do it myself.

2629
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:30,000
I found out that the owner of the website took orders to actually mod consoles.

2630
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:36,000
So after I got permission from my mom I contacted the owner and sent out my Super Nintendo.

2631
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:40,000
When my Super Nintendo came back it had two large metal switches on the side.

2632
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:44,000
One switched from NTSC to PAL and the other switch disabled the region check.

2633
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:49,000
I was very lucky to then purchase a boxed European Terranigma game with a manual on eBay.

2634
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:54,000
The game played perfectly. I was so happy to finally experience the game with all the effects and lighting.

2635
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:57,000
I played a lot of it but sadly never finished the game.

2636
02:08:57,000 --> 02:09:04,000
You would think since I went through all the trouble I would finish the game but I had and still have very bad gamer ADD.

2637
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:08,000
I still have my own modded Super Nintendo and Terranigma game cartridge.

2638
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:12,000
It still works and I plan to play the full game hopefully soon.

2639
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:17,000
I like that story though. You set your eyes on something and you said I am doing this.

2640
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:25,000
So you know what, it's okay that you didn't finish but I also have the exact same problem you do where I drop a ton of money on games and then I don't always finish them.

2641
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:29,000
Another thing you guys mentioned last week was Jersey Jack.

2642
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,000
This pinball company is very local to me.

2643
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:36,000
During this past summer I was able to play all three of their machines at a local pinball arcade.

2644
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:40,000
The Wizard of Oz, The Hobbit, and the one that Jamie couldn't remember, Dialed In.

2645
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:47,000
Dialed In was very interesting. It brings a lot of modern technology in its gameplay which you do not normally see in the other pinball machines.

2646
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:52,000
One of the cool features is that you can connect to the machine using Bluetooth using your phone.

2647
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:55,000
This wasn't working at the time but I talked to the owner about it.

2648
02:09:55,000 --> 02:10:00,000
He said that once you connect you can control the flippers of the machine to mess with the player. What?

2649
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:05,000
It sounds very interesting. Another nice feature is that it has volume control on the side.

2650
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:07,000
You can actually turn up the volume to hear it better.

2651
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:11,000
I think all pinball and arcade machines should have this option because arcades are loud.

2652
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:17,000
Also during gameplay the machine vibrates like how video game controls do giving an extra feel to the play.

2653
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:20,000
Their Hobbit machine also has this feature.

2654
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:25,000
Lastly the game gives you a QR code at the end if you play it so that you can tweet your score.

2655
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
I hope to go back soon to play it again.

2656
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:30,000
I'm sad that I won't see you guys at MAGFest in January.

2657
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:36,000
Even though a lot of people had trouble getting a hotel room, my boyfriend was lucky to grab one at the convention center.

2658
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:39,000
I'm really looking forward to this one. It will be my third year.

2659
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:42,000
My goals for this one is to see more bands perform.

2660
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:45,000
Anyway, till next time, stay black, Ziba.

2661
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:48,000
Thank you for the email Ziba. I really appreciate that.

2662
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:51,000
Some good stories in there. That's cool about that dialed in.

2663
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:54,000
I have not seen that machine and I will pass that along to Jamie.

2664
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:58,000
I know she left early tonight but I'll make sure she reads about that because I think she'd get a kick out of that too.

2665
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:02,000
Apparently GameFAQs does have a pretty nice release listing available to use that.

2666
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:06,000
Well there you go. That email may have changed the course of the show.

2667
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:09,000
Anyway, but I do want to say quickly about MAGFest.

2668
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:12,000
I did hear about the hotel room drama this week.

2669
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:17,000
And to be honest, I'm not trying to be shady because I really, really enjoyed MAGFest the years I went.

2670
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,000
I really did. I do want to go again.

2671
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:23,000
Obviously with everything I went through over the summer, it wasn't in the cards to happen.

2672
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:27,000
And to be fair, with all the other stress I had this week,

2673
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:32,000
if I had walked out of that not getting a hotel room for MAGFest on top of that,

2674
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
that would have just fucking broke me.

2675
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:38,000
So like, I'm really happy I sat this year out.

2676
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:44,000
Although I will sorely miss all of the fine folks that I see at that convention every year.

2677
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:47,000
It's okay Rob. You'll just have to make sure you go to MAG West too whenever they announce it.

2678
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,000
Well you know, I'm open to that.

2679
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:52,000
I know I sat out the first year because...

2680
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:53,000
Why did I sit out?

2681
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:56,000
Because it was the summer and it was a problem time.

2682
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
Oh god, yeah, because that was after. Oh yeah.

2683
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
That was like the week after or something.

2684
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
Yeah, because at first I was like, well maybe...

2685
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:05,000
Because I didn't really have a lot of time off already and I was like,

2686
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:09,000
I knew that DragonCon was the next week and that was the other problem.

2687
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:14,000
So I was like, well maybe I'll drive in for the Saturday and I'll go for a day.

2688
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:18,000
And then the other stuff happened and it was like, nope, I'm not going at all.

2689
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:19,000
So yeah.

2690
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:20,000
It was a good time though.

2691
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:23,000
And it's a lot closer than DC.

2692
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:26,000
It is, but it's not the same people. No offense.

2693
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:27,000
I mean, I love my West Coast people.

2694
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:29,000
Well, we need to get them to go too.

2695
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:31,000
See, they need to come out here for this one, yeah.

2696
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:36,000
I do think though, MAG Fest has probably outgrown National Harbor.

2697
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:40,000
And I know they keep saying, we're not moving it. We're under a contract.

2698
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:45,000
I think, guys, you need to listen to the feedback you're getting.

2699
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:49,000
And a lot of people are telling you, you need to move MAG Fest.

2700
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:51,000
Are there bigger venues?

2701
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:52,000
What's that?

2702
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:53,000
Are there bigger venues in the area?

2703
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:55,000
Sure, it's Washington, D.C. for fuck's sake.

2704
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:57,000
I don't know a lot about the convention space.

2705
02:12:57,000 --> 02:13:01,000
Well, if they can do government conventions out there, they can do a gaming convention.

2706
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:04,000
I'm sure there's a lot of concerns about 24-hour availability.

2707
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:05,000
I know that's the big one.

2708
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:08,000
When you do things at hotels, like DragonCon and stuff,

2709
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:13,000
you can do things around the clock a lot more easily than an official convention center is not going to let you do that.

2710
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:18,000
I hope they can find a happy medium somewhere because National...

2711
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:22,000
Well, I mean, the thing with National Harbor, too, is that it's super isolated.

2712
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:26,000
Maybe they could find a hotel cluster in downtown D.C. that isn't so isolated.

2713
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:30,000
So it's like the Santa Clara Convention Center where there's literally nothing in walking distance.

2714
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:37,000
Kind of, but it's just different because on the East Coast with the Potomac's running through there, right?

2715
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:43,000
So imagine National Harbor is kind of like, I want to say an island, but it dips out into the Potomac.

2716
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:47,000
And so it's like a little, like it's a peninsula of sorts.

2717
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:50,000
So there's kind of only a couple of ways in and out.

2718
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
Is it cut off by a freeway or something?

2719
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:55,000
Yeah, there's a freeway and there's a lot of residential stuff around it.

2720
02:13:55,000 --> 02:14:00,000
I mean, Alexandria isn't that far, but it's like there's, you know, when you're going to a 24-hour game convention,

2721
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:04,000
you don't want to like at 4 a.m. be like, oh, I got to take my 20-minute ride back to Alexandria.

2722
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
So they have a lot of stuff they need to consider.

2723
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:11,000
I know there's a lot of people that are like, but the joy of MAGFest or the vibes are going to be gone.

2724
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:17,000
Well, my understanding is this is why MAGFest has MagLabs and all this other stuff that they do,

2725
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:23,000
is to capture that spirit or whatever they said of the original MAGFest, whatever they want to call it.

2726
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:32,000
So let's see. Yeah, Bobby Blackwolf says the hotel they're at is where they do government conventions.

2727
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:37,000
I mean, CPAC is there. Yeah, I do remember like the week after MAGFest.

2728
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:40,000
It's really depressing to think of CPAC as government.

2729
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:44,000
Yeah, I know. But it's, you know, something you would see in DC.

2730
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:45,000
Yeah.

2731
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,000
Things you find in DC for $500, Alex.

2732
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,000
So not for that much.

2733
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:58,000
All right. Anyway, moving on, that was it for the email.

2734
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:03,000
So thank you, Ziba. I really appreciate that. And yes, I thought so.

2735
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:05,000
There was one more that came in here late.

2736
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:10,000
So I'm being nice because I like this person an awful lot that's emailing us.

2737
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:18,000
So I want to read this email here one more from MegamanX400, my co-host over on the Reading is Fundamental podcast,

2738
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:23,000
which will be back because we had a new episode on Monday on Friday episode.

2739
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:29,000
I don't know when we're recording it, but we've got a good like two or three months before All Stars is really on.

2740
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:33,000
So we got time. Anyway, let's read this.

2741
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:40,000
Hey, OLR crew. Tonight, there was some good discussion and debate regarding publishers, EA and Activision,

2742
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:45,000
and the high cost of game budgets and whether or not single-player linear games are profitable.

2743
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:52,000
I definitely think that the approach in which companies like EA, Activision, Square Enix go about making these large-scale one-player games

2744
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:56,000
doesn't yield them as high of a return as these online multiplayer games do.

2745
02:15:56,000 --> 02:16:02,000
Destiny, Overwatch, Grand Theft Auto V are games that allow you to keep playing and have no endgame

2746
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:05,000
and allow the publisher to milk more money out of gamers.

2747
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:10,000
Single-player games don't present as many options in a world of loot boxes to make more money.

2748
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:16,000
That being said, the development costs on open-ended games versus linear single-player games are probably comparable

2749
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:19,000
due to the amount of time developing the graphics and so forth.

2750
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:26,000
My point in all this is developers need to look into other viable methods to create those single-player stories

2751
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:29,000
that don't run the millions of dollars in development.

2752
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:34,000
In the current state of the gaming market, this is where I feel the Switch has a bit of an advantage right now

2753
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:37,000
and is drawing some third parties and indie developers.

2754
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:41,000
I know it's been stated before by many, why can't Switch have more power?

2755
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:44,000
But it might work in its favor right now.

2756
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:47,000
Developers can spend less of a development budget on a Switch game,

2757
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:50,000
and even though it may sell less than your blockbuster AAA titles,

2758
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:54,000
the profit margin is potential to be higher than those AAA titles.

2759
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:57,000
Just wanted to share my thoughts on this discussion that took place tonight.

2760
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:59,000
Take care, Mega Man X 400.

2761
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:06,000
Well, Square Enix getting on board with the Switch with this project Octopath Traveler, right?

2762
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:11,000
And that game definitely doesn't look like it has the graphics of a Final Fantasy XV,

2763
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:14,000
but I think has a lot of people excited nonetheless.

2764
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:19,000
So I think some devs may be going that direction, actually.

2765
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:21,000
Is that a Switch exclusive?

2766
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,000
As far as I know, I believe it is.

2767
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:26,000
I do not believe they've announced it for any other platforms.

2768
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
It's only going to be on Switch.

2769
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:31,000
So, interesting.

2770
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:36,000
What do you think about that email and this whole, you know,

2771
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:40,000
make more games for the Switch, I guess, as one way out of it?

2772
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:45,000
Do you think maybe, you know, Loki, I know you're usually very tongue-in-cheek when it comes to Nintendo,

2773
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:50,000
do you think maybe our emailer has a point that maybe the Switch has a small advantage here

2774
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:53,000
because they're selling two million of them and still going,

2775
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:57,000
and they're probably cheaper to make games for than the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One?

2776
02:17:57,000 --> 02:17:59,000
I don't know if they're cheaper to make games for

2777
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:02,000
because those cartridges are more expensive to, you know,

2778
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:06,000
press the game onto versus, you know, a CD or DVD.

2779
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:11,000
But in the scope of a multi-million dollar budget in creating the game.

2780
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:15,000
Well, right, there's no point in creating, you know, these really impressive graphics

2781
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:17,000
if you can't display it on the device,

2782
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:23,000
like I said before, they don't really have to push the boundaries for graphics in these games.

2783
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:27,000
I mean, they feel like that they do sometimes, but I don't think I've ever said,

2784
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:30,000
yeah, I'm not gonna buy that game because the graphics aren't good.

2785
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:33,000
It's usually, I'm not gonna buy that game because it doesn't look fun.

2786
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:37,000
I've never just, well, the added more lens flares and those explosions look better,

2787
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,000
I would probably buy that game.

2788
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:41,000
I'd buy Earth Defense Force, for fuck's sake.

2789
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:45,000
Look at that game, that's purely gameplay because the graphics and the physics suck.

2790
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:47,000
The graphics suck.

2791
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:51,000
On the other hand, have you ever been more motivated to buy a game because the graphics were so good?

2792
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:57,000
I mean, and I'll admit, part of the reason I've waited on Destiny 2 for PC

2793
02:18:57,000 --> 02:19:00,000
is for the, you know, better graphics.

2794
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:03,000
The only one that I can think of that, like, I was like,

2795
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:07,000
oh man, the graphics look really good are like Rockstar games

2796
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:09,000
and I buy those anyways because of the gameplay.

2797
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:11,000
But yeah, the graphics look nice too.

2798
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:15,000
But I'll buy something specifically for the graphics.

2799
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:19,000
So I thought the point he was making was that they don't have to spend as much on labor

2800
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:26,000
to develop really complicated graphics if they know they're working with lower capacity, you know, systems.

2801
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:27,000
Right.

2802
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:30,000
Do you think that, like, the cartridge cost offsets all of that?

2803
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:33,000
Because I thought labor was a lot more expensive than the physical production.

2804
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:37,000
Well, in the end it's gonna depend on how many copies they can sell

2805
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:41,000
and they're gonna look at, you know, how many units are out there of that system

2806
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:44,000
versus how many units are out for the other systems and they're gonna develop accordingly.

2807
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:49,000
And honestly, more and more is going digital, which is a whole other debate for another day, but that's the reality.

2808
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:52,000
On top of that though, you have to also look at companies like EA.

2809
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:55,000
It is gonna be more expensive to develop on that platform

2810
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:58,000
because they have this stupid Frostbite engine that they want to use for everything

2811
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
and Frostbite doesn't run on that system.

2812
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:06,000
So they have to develop a new engine for the lower end hardware that's gonna do something that they want to do.

2813
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:10,000
I mean, I guess they could try to recycle something they haven't in the past, but probably not gonna be the case.

2814
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:13,000
So you have to look at that as well

2815
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:18,000
because it can be an additional cost if they're developing using this one engine on all these other platforms,

2816
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:22,000
but this one-off platform requires a completely different engine.

2817
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
That's why they didn't develop a lot against the Wii.

2818
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
Fabulous, fabulous emails tonight.

2819
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:27,000
Thank you all so much.

2820
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:33,000
Participate at orangelandtrady.com if you would like to have your email considered for our next episode.

2821
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:35,000
For the meantime, we gotta move on with just a few.

2822
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:41,000
We just have a handful of stories here, and then we're gonna get to our Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

2823
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:43,000
But first, Loki.

2824
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:48,000
Yes, so celebrating Valve's Orange Box, the 10-year anniversary of that,

2825
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:56,000
they released a brand new update for Team Fortress 2 called the Jungle Inferno update,

2826
02:20:56,000 --> 02:21:05,000
along with that, a wonderful new Valve movie of Saxon Hale that was hilarious.

2827
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:11,000
Wait, is this an update on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 even, or just the PC version of Orange Box?

2828
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:14,000
I think it's just the PC version. I don't know if they're updating those anymore.

2829
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:18,000
I was gonna say, that would be pretty impressive if they went back and updated the old, old title.

2830
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:23,000
It would be nice if then it would release a new 10th anniversary edition of Orange Box.

2831
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:25,000
Act F confirms just PC.

2832
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:29,000
Along with that, of course, they had some new maps.

2833
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:36,000
They've got Banana Bay and Brazil, which I guess some of those were made by Valve and some actually by the community.

2834
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
New gear as well.

2835
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:44,000
The biggest update, though, comes with Pyro, who gets a jetpack now.

2836
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:50,000
They also have a new single-shot flamethrower that looks pretty awesome.

2837
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:54,000
So that's kind of a big change, because now the Pyro can actually get across the map pretty fast.

2838
02:21:54,000 --> 02:22:00,000
Well, that's pretty cool that they're doing some changes to kind of maybe bring some eyes back to the game.

2839
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:07,000
I mean, I'm sure, you know, obviously a game like Team Fortress 2 is always gonna have an audience that's out there playing it.

2840
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:12,000
But certainly there's a lot of people that are like, ooh, I got a new girl and her name's Overwatch.

2841
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
I'm gonna go play that for a little while, right?

2842
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:15,000
Splatoon.

2843
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:18,000
Well, and it's a free-to-play game, so you can jump in and check it out anytime.

2844
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:19,000
That's true.

2845
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:20,000
That's true.

2846
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:23,000
And maybe this is a way to kind of bring some of those eyes back.

2847
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:27,000
Hey, don't forget about us. We're where it started, yo, ten years ago.

2848
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:32,000
Yeah, you can't argue that a lot of inspiration for Overwatch came from Team Fortress 2.

2849
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:33,000
Absolutely.

2850
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:34,000
All right.

2851
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:41,000
And actdeft in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, which, by the way, I forgot to say this earlier because I didn't realize it until somebody messaged me.

2852
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:47,000
But I guess the actual web client chat isn't working right tonight.

2853
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:51,000
You have to go in through regular IRC, so that's why we have a lot less chatters than we usually do.

2854
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:52,000
Is Mibbit down?

2855
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:59,000
Yeah, I think something about that whole, or it's connecting to the wrong server or something weird's going on there, so it's just an error for tonight.

2856
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:00,000
So sorry, guys.

2857
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:05,000
Just so you know, everything does run on the old-ass internet backbone of IRC.

2858
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:08,000
Yes, the Internet Relay Chat channel.

2859
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:09,000
IRC.

2860
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:11,000
Everything runs on the old-ass fucking backbone of IRC.

2861
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:21,000
So if you have, like, M-I-R-C or one of those clients, you just go to the Gamesurge Network, which is IRC.gamesurge.net, and we are in channel vog, pound vog.

2862
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:27,000
And see, a lot of people today, like, because everything got so integrated with the web and things like Discord, they probably have no idea what I'm talking about.

2863
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:32,000
Like, IRC was, like, all we fucking had, like, ten years ago and even further back.

2864
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:37,000
So I remember when I was in college, I used to chat on M-I-R-C all the time.

2865
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:38,000
Yeah.

2866
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:39,000
That was it.

2867
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:40,000
We didn't have Discord or Slack.

2868
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:41,000
Back in my day!

2869
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:44,000
I was in middle school when I first got on IRC.

2870
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:51,000
But to be fair, our old asses at vog are finally evolving a little bit, and we do have a Discord as well.

2871
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:54,000
Discord's not replacing chat, but it's...

2872
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:59,000
I find it's a nice way to keep in touch throughout the week, and it's working a little more effectively than our forums were.

2873
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:05,000
Actually, I would say Discord has been way more successful than the forums were, because I think forums are a dying art.

2874
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:07,000
Which we'll get into later, by the way.

2875
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:09,000
But I'll leave that as a tease.

2876
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:10,000
Oh boy.

2877
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:13,000
Yeah, I decided.

2878
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:16,000
Let's just open that door and see where we go.

2879
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:20,000
But anyway, I do want to mention vognetwork.com slash Discord.

2880
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:23,000
If you want to hang with us throughout the week, it's a great place to go.

2881
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:31,000
And Rama points out you can also go to irc.gamesurge.net slash vog.

2882
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:33,000
Rama says, oh, there's an IRC link here.

2883
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:37,000
Well, you can't put a link to IRC in IRC, Rama.

2884
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:39,000
That's not going to help.

2885
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:44,000
But I will consider doing a tweet later or something, just so people know they have a plan B.

2886
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:50,000
All right, meanwhile, let's talk about a mini cabinet.

2887
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:56,000
Have you ever wanted to own your own arcade cabinet, but thought, boy, these fuckers are expensive.

2888
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
Well, maybe this is something for you.

2889
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:02,000
It is what they called, I guess it's Replicade is the name of this.

2890
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
Replicade Cross Centipede.

2891
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:09,000
It is a one-sixth scale cabinet replica, and you can play centipede.

2892
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:12,000
It is one-sixth of size.

2893
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:18,000
So that means it has a three and a half inch LCD monitor that's built into it.

2894
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:22,000
And yes, a tiny little trackball that you can use to actually play the game.

2895
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:26,000
The cabinet runs on a lithium-ion battery to actually power the whole thing.

2896
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:32,000
And they're saying it is lag-free performance through to chipset, which the company New Wave is making.

2897
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
They are going crowdfunding for this.

2898
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:39,000
You can back it and pledge $90 if you want one of these in April of 2018.

2899
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:43,000
But they are expecting that these cabinets are going to be $160 at retail.

2900
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:47,000
So if you want this to be a little cheaper, you want to pay $90 for it today.

2901
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:49,000
So again, if you want to check that out.

2902
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:51,000
Can you build a bar top for cheaper than that?

2903
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:54,000
There's a little Kickstarter if you want to check out that.

2904
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,000
I think it's a cute idea.

2905
02:25:56,000 --> 02:26:02,000
You know what's funny? I have those tiny, tiny cabinets that Jamie found at Walmart.

2906
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:05,000
And ironically, one of them is centipede.

2907
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:07,000
And the other one is Qbert.

2908
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:09,000
And that is in this arcade classics thing.

2909
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:10,000
And they are tiny.

2910
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
They're probably tinier than this thing is.

2911
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:17,000
Because those screens are no bigger than like an inch and a half.

2912
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:19,000
Like those screens are tiny.

2913
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:20,000
But they're cute.

2914
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,000
I like them because I like old arcade.

2915
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:23,000
And those are only $20.

2916
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:25,000
So they're cute little collectibles.

2917
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:28,000
But obviously you'll notice they're still in the box.

2918
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,000
So it's not like I play them all day.

2919
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,000
You can still play them through the box.

2920
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:35,000
Like when it's in the store, there's little cutouts in the plastic.

2921
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:36,000
So you can play them in the store.

2922
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:37,000
And run down the battery.

2923
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:39,000
Yeah, and run down the battery. Exactly.

2924
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:42,000
So that's why I haven't taken them out of the box.

2925
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
Because you can still kind of check them out.

2926
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:47,000
Replicade again is the name if you want to look for that.

2927
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:52,000
I feel like Replicade sounds like a sci-fi series like Androids or somebody.

2928
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,000
Maybe that's Replicant.

2929
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,000
Maybe. Maybe.

2930
02:26:57,000 --> 02:27:01,000
Also, Rama says a good link to get on IRC.

2931
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:02,000
You can actually go to his show.

2932
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:07,000
AnimeJamSession.com slash VOG Network has all the IRC details.

2933
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:11,000
To be fair, I think live.vognetwork.com does have the IRC details.

2934
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:13,000
But it's in really tiny text.

2935
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:19,000
Because Bobby realizes most people that are going to use IRC already kind of know how to get there.

2936
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:25,000
And the web client works for other people that don't really know IRC or don't use it a lot.

2937
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:29,000
Which is fine. Again, it's kind of an old art form at this point.

2938
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:31,000
So you have to look for the really tiny text.

2939
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:34,000
But it will help you get on IRC the old-fashioned way if you need it.

2940
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:39,000
As soon as I figured out you guys were using Nivot to do IRC chat, I just googled Game Surge IRC.

2941
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:41,000
When I started doing chat.

2942
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:46,000
Which, honestly, I don't even know who runs Game Surge or what the Game Surge is.

2943
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:49,000
Game Surge dates back to when we were on all games.

2944
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:51,000
All games ran through the Game Surge Network.

2945
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:55,000
So we were like, well, we don't want people to have to go to another server.

2946
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:56,000
We might as well just stay here.

2947
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:59,000
And running your own IRC server is a pain in the ass.

2948
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:01,000
Oh, yeah. No, I wouldn't run our own.

2949
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:04,000
Why would we run our own IRC server when we can use Discord now?

2950
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:07,000
Yeah. I have a friend who does that.

2951
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:10,000
For some old LiveJournal people.

2952
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:15,000
So, speaking of old, outdated relics that people still use.

2953
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:17,000
I used to visit this forum every day.

2954
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:20,000
No, I know. I can't resist throwing a little shade.

2955
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:23,000
Although, this is nothing to be shady about.

2956
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:25,000
This is some serious shit that's going down right now.

2957
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:27,000
Yes, as with the last few weeks.

2958
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:32,000
With everybody coming out about their experience with sexual harassment and everything.

2959
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:35,000
Of course, some of it's already hit the game industry.

2960
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:38,000
We talked about it last week.

2961
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:40,000
There was a site that was responsible.

2962
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:45,000
They had some of the owners of that that were caught in some bad situation.

2963
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:51,000
Well, now NeoGaf is also receiving some of that.

2964
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:58,000
Because apparently the founder of NeoGaf, Tyler Evilore, Malka.

2965
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:03,000
Had some sexual harassment claims made against him.

2966
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:10,000
Regarding, I guess, an experience he had with some female acquaintance or whatever.

2967
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:13,000
In a hotel room at some event or something like that.

2968
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:18,000
Once she came out about it, then there was more stories coming out about all the stuff that's happened.

2969
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:21,000
So with that, all the mods left.

2970
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:24,000
And then finally, he shut the site down.

2971
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:28,000
In waiting a statement or something like that.

2972
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:31,000
As of right now, it's gone.

2973
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:33,000
So that is interesting.

2974
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:37,000
Considering the fact that also that their site was trying to push this whole, you know,

2975
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:43,000
we're going to try to have the backs of women and try to stop this type of harassment going on in here.

2976
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:47,000
That there was this whole kind of dark side the whole time about it.

2977
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:59,000
You know, it's been tough this week to hear how many people I know that have been personally affected by things like this.

2978
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:04,000
And it's just like one of those like, what a fucking awful world we live in.

2979
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:09,000
But at the same time, I'm really happy people are empowered to speak up.

2980
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:13,000
So that maybe change will fucking happen this time.

2981
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:21,000
And maybe people will take the hint that, I don't know, maybe possibly they could stop raping people.

2982
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:28,000
That would be fantastic if everybody could just learn that as like a basic human instinct.

2983
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:33,000
As like most people, I think we all kind of know, don't murder somebody.

2984
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:35,000
Just don't do it.

2985
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:38,000
It's really not a good idea to murder somebody.

2986
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:47,000
It would be great if people were wired that same way when it came to things like sexual assault, rape and all those, you know, hideous things.

2987
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:53,000
Like you just, you don't do it.

2988
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:55,000
I don't know what else to say on it.

2989
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:59,000
Like it obviously is an issue that goes way deeper than video games.

2990
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:01,000
Our little podcast.

2991
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:02,000
Terrible people are everywhere.

2992
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:03,000
Yeah, yeah.

2993
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:04,000
Well, I guess that's what it boils down to.

2994
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,000
Terrible people are everywhere.

2995
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:16,000
And we have to all put our foot down, all of us, with the women, with all of us need to sit down.

2996
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:20,000
All minorities, majorities, everybody has to put their foot down and say, no more.

2997
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:23,000
This will not represent our culture anymore.

2998
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:26,000
Stop.

2999
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:28,000
I don't know what else to say.

3000
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:33,000
You know, I think it speaks to the credit of the admins of that site for all stepping down in protest.

3001
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:39,000
Like all of the forum administrators in response, like when this came out, like resigned the same day.

3002
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:44,000
And that's not always the response that you see this happening when these kinds of things come out.

3003
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:48,000
Like, so that, I mean, I think that's at least something.

3004
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:49,000
Yeah.

3005
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:52,000
You know, instead of just going on as business as usual and we're going to ignore it.

3006
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:57,000
Yeah. Or, you know, or turning the victim into she's lying.

3007
02:31:57,000 --> 02:32:04,000
She's that, you know, and all that, which I'm sure there are people out there that are saying that who need to just, just, just disappear.

3008
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
Just, just disappear.

3009
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:09,000
Your services are not needed at this time.

3010
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:11,000
Well, they're going to the bad place.

3011
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:14,000
Yes, they are going to the bad place.

3012
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:15,000
That's a very good way to look.

3013
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:21,000
I, everything I do in my life now, I'm going to look in terms of, will this put me in the good place or the bad place?

3014
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:23,000
Will Janet be there or not?

3015
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:25,000
It'll put you in the medium place.

3016
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:32,000
At least that woman gets to masturbate in solitude constantly.

3017
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:35,000
Yeah, but her train full of cocaine never arrives.

3018
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:37,000
Okay. I'm sorry.

3019
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:39,000
Do not turn something like this into something funny.

3020
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:40,000
All right.

3021
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:42,000
Moving on. Was there more with this?

3022
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:55,000
Yes, there is also a story regarding a former employee of Naughty Dog at David Ballard who said that he had been sexually harassed by a superior at that company.

3023
02:32:55,000 --> 02:33:01,000
Basically saying, in late 2015, I was sexually harassed by, at Naughty Dog by a lead.

3024
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:04,000
My work environment became extremely toxic.

3025
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:08,000
Afterward, in February 2016, I had a mental breakdown at work.

3026
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:12,000
Sony PlayStation HR became involved when I told them about the harassment.

3027
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:15,000
They ended the call and fired me the next day.

3028
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:20,000
They cited that the company was moving in a different direction and my job was no longer needed.

3029
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:28,000
They tried to silence me by offering me $20,000 if I signed a letter agreeing to the termination as well as not to discuss it with anyone.

3030
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:32,000
I declined to sign and I've been unemployed for 17 months since.

3031
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:44,000
And, of course, Naughty Dog came out and basically said that we've recently read on social media that an ex-employee of Naughty Dog, Dave Ballard, claims he was sexually harassed when he worked at Naughty Dog.

3032
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:54,000
We have not found any evidence of having received allegations from Mr. Ballard that he was harassed anyway at Naughty Dog or Sony Interactive Entertainment.

3033
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:59,000
Harassment and inappropriate conduct have no place at Naughty Dog or Sony Interactive Entertainment.

3034
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:06,000
We have taken and always will take reports of sexual harassment and other workplace grievances very seriously.

3035
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:10,000
We value every single person who works at Naughty Dog and Sony Interactive Entertainment.

3036
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:19,000
It is of the utmost importance that we maintain safe, productive workplace environments that allow us to channel and share our passion of making games.

3037
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:26,000
That was a very vanilla, sterile response to that whole situation.

3038
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:27,000
Yeah, so I don't know.

3039
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:30,000
It's expected. It's an expected response, unfortunately.

3040
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:33,000
Look, it's hard to say, you know, it's he...

3041
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:35,000
Didn't he say he went to Sony?

3042
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:36,000
Yes.

3043
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:38,000
So why does Naughty Dog say we don't have it on our record?

3044
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:41,000
Well, I think it was Sony making that comment that they didn't have...

3045
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:43,000
See how it's weird?

3046
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:47,000
This one sounds really complicated. I read a little about it, but it's hard to make sense of.

3047
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:57,000
Here's the bottom line, because, you know, we don't... I mean, this poor guy, whatever happened to him, now everybody's talking about it and people are tweeting him with their own opinions.

3048
02:34:57,000 --> 02:35:00,000
And again, your services are not needed. Shut up.

3049
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:04,000
Like, you know, and I don't want to contribute to that noise.

3050
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:14,000
But what I will say is, well, we found out in a big way in these past couple weeks that sexism exists in the movie industry. Is anybody shocked?

3051
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:18,000
Well, in the fact that it seems like a lot of them knew about it and just did nothing about it.

3052
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:22,000
So is anybody shocked to hear it probably is happening in the game industry, too?

3053
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:23,000
Probably.

3054
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:26,000
No, I say probably. It is happening in the game industry, too.

3055
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:27,000
And other industries.

3056
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:33,000
Yeah, and probably, no, definitely, this is happening in every industry.

3057
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:34,000
So...

3058
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:41,000
It's just because these shitty people are everywhere and they have all these different jobs and that's why you go on the internet and you're gonna run into shitty people.

3059
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:49,000
And I'm not saying that makes it okay, but at least something as visible as the movie industry or as visible as the game industry,

3060
02:35:49,000 --> 02:36:00,000
maybe now, hopefully, change is coming from that level that will roll down into every industry where this shit stops and people are wired to know,

3061
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:08,000
gee, I shouldn't sexually harass somebody today. That would not be a good idea and will get me sent to the bad place.

3062
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:14,000
Perhaps I should not invite my potential actresses up to my hotel room and ask them to watch me shower.

3063
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:22,000
Yeah, that would be a bad idea. Yes, it would. And it would be great if people had the instinct to know that.

3064
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:32,000
Well, from what I heard, the inviting up to hotel rooms is a standard thing in the movie industry because they set up their rooms as meeting space.

3065
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:38,000
So the, oh, let's go to my hotel room is not the suspicious part. It's the what happens when you get there.

3066
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:48,000
And that's a really hard problem to untangle because you don't know that it's gonna be bad until you're already in that situation, which makes it so much worse.

3067
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:59,000
I think the thing that really just makes you shake your head and go, ugh, is when that video surfaced of Courtney Love in 2005 saying,

3068
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:07,000
and she says, didn't they ask her, they asked her, and I'm paraphrasing here, they asked her something like, do you have any advice for other women in the industry?

3069
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:17,000
And she goes, and she said it in a very Courtney Love, I don't give a fuck kind of way. She says, if you ever get invited by Harvey Weinstein to a party at the four rooms, say no.

3070
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:26,000
And so now that's coming back in full force now, right? But it goes, the reason why is that this has been around a very long time.

3071
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:32,000
If that goes back to 2005, I would bet you there's many actresses that go back to the fucking 1950s, it was probably worse in the 1950s and 40s.

3072
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:52,000
And when things were, you know, even a long time ago, like, yeah, well, I mean, they, the only, the only sliver of a good thing maybe we can take from this is that this will be the generation that changes this.

3073
02:37:52,000 --> 02:38:02,000
Hopefully. Well, I mean, people are feeling empowered to speak up. So we stop making jokes about millennials liking avocado toast and this bullshit, and maybe this will be the generation that changes it.

3074
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:20,000
Anyway, let's move on to something else. Shall we? I would say, let's move on to Legos. Legos is a happy subject, right? Something fun, right?

3075
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:27,000
I love Legos. Unfortunately, I wish I had better news, but Lego dimensions is not coming back. It's pretty much a sure thing at this point.

3076
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:39,000
That's too bad. I mean, cause I thought out of all the like, you know, toys, life things that that did, you know, was the most well done game. The problem with that game though is it's so fucking expensive.

3077
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:51,000
It was just because not, not only is it the toys to games tax, but then it's the Lego tax. It's the Lego tax. It's like, Oh, Hey, you want one of those expansions? That's 40 fucking dollars. No, I don't have that kind of money.

3078
02:38:51,000 --> 02:39:03,000
We were just browsing in like target yesterday. And like, I still wanted that midway arcade set. They still had, it was a 30 bucks. And it was like ridiculous. I'm like, well, no wonder it's shutting down.

3079
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:17,000
You know, here's a, here's a quick tip, uh, check some of those Facebook groups, like the marketplace and stuff. People selling their old Lego dimension sets. I found one that was like, it was an Xbox one version, but they had like 30 different expansions for like a hundred dollars.

3080
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:31,000
My friend saw a shit ton of the expansion sets at the fucking 99 cent store. Yeah. I wanted to go there and get some cause I like still building them and stuff. Um, and I want the mini fix from them just because some of them are pretty cool. Um, like I'd like to have the portal and that'd be pretty cool.

3081
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:38,000
What worries me about buying used Legos is do they actually find all the bricks? Cause I'm like, there's so many little tiny things. It's easy to lose some of them.

3082
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:57,000
Usually like, it depends. Like you can go on there's websites like brick link or whatever. You can actually go buy you sets from people and they're in different, um, types of, um, you know, conditions and stuff. And usually they'll state if there's anything missing or if it's complete and you can tell because they have an inventory on in the manual, it shows what it is.

3083
02:39:57,000 --> 02:40:20,000
Sure. Um, and then the best part about it is if you are missing something, you can order it. And I mean, it's cheap. It's like a few cents. Here's the other thing about Lego dimensions. You don't really need to build a goddamn thing. You don't, you don't have to even open up the bricks. If you don't want to, the only thing you need is that little disc with the chip on it that you build the Lego on top of, because that's where the data really is, is on that.

3084
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:32,000
Now, of course, I don't, why, why would you buy a Lego game and not play with the Legos? But to be fair, you technically don't have to even do it. Like you just need that little disc that reads the information. That's all you really need.

3085
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:37,000
I'm just imagining Facebook marketplace quality being the same as like random people selling things on Craigslist.

3086
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:38,000
It is.

3087
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:39,000
You have like, you know, as is.

3088
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:41,000
But a lot of the ones I've seen though aren't open.

3089
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:42,000
That's good.

3090
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:46,000
Like they bought like all this stuff. They go gung ho into it and then they just never played it.

3091
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:47,000
Hmm.

3092
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:48,000
Like I understand that.

3093
02:40:48,000 --> 02:41:00,000
Anyhow, we didn't really get around to it, but why is this going around this week? It's because Traveler's Tales, who makes the game, there's a game studio manager, Dave Dootson, I guess wrote something to all the employees that made his way onto the net.

3094
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:13,000
And it said, thanks so much to everyone for making Dimensions possible. As difficult as it has been, it is worth celebrating the incredible achievement it represents in the quality of the game, the amazing blend of IPs and the challenging technical demands it presented.

3095
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:20,000
It stands as a real testament to the talent within TT. So, I mean, it reads like an obituary, basically.

3096
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:26,000
It's too bad. And I really do want to collect some of the other games, but like that stuff has not come down in price frame. Some of them.

3097
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:32,000
Like I always, like you were mentioning Target, I've been going to their clearance section and they have had some of the Dimensions stuff in there.

3098
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:36,000
But it's the Dimensions stuff I like, I don't want. Like it's like, you know, weird.

3099
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:38,000
Yeah, I think we saw something in there.

3100
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:39,000
Yeah.

3101
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:40,000
Oh, Ninjago was in there, I think.

3102
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:41,000
Yeah.

3103
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:47,000
Yeah, we looked at the clearance and they had some stuff. Is Traveler's Tale still around? Like, are they closing as a part of that, too?

3104
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:48,000
I don't think so.

3105
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:54,000
No, they're still around. They're making lots of LEGO games. Like, they've got the LEGO Marvel universe. Or, LEGO Marvel.

3106
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:55,000
So they're just ending Super Heroes.

3107
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:56,000
Those are one thing.

3108
02:41:56,000 --> 02:42:01,000
Yeah, those LEGO games still make a lot of money. It's just the toys to life part of it is sunsetting.

3109
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:09,000
Yeah, it's just a lot of shelf space and it really was the LEGO part of that. It was just so expensive for those sets.

3110
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:14,000
Like, $40 for what amounts to basically a piece of DLC.

3111
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:17,000
I'm going to just jump in here real quick and say our Skype line is open.

3112
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:20,000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, if you want to give us a call.

3113
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:24,000
We'll try to squeeze in a couple calls. We're about to 9 o'clock tonight, but we'll try to squeeze in a couple calls.

3114
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:28,000
I'm actually not going to be streaming after the show tonight, either, since I have company in from out of town.

3115
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:37,000
After the week I had, I know I haven't been streaming a lot lately, but I kind of want to hit the reset button, so to speak, and try to come back maybe a little later next week.

3116
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:40,000
So I'm not going to be streaming tonight, but we are going to open up Skype line right now for some calls.

3117
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:42,000
Finish your thought here real quick, Loki, and then we'll get to the calls.

3118
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:48,000
Yeah, it was just expensive. I wanted to get some of that stuff, but anything LEGO is just really ridiculously expensive.

3119
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:52,000
Yeah, it really is. It's paying that extra tax on top of everything else.

3120
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:58,000
All right, but we are going to try to go to the phones here and take a call. I think we do have something coming in right now.

3121
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:02,000
Let's get to it. Whoa, it's still, it hung up. It missed.

3122
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:08,000
It's the one thing I don't like about using this iPad right now is that, like, I'll try to bring the, I'll try to remember next week.

3123
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:21,000
I still have to wipe that thing. No, well, it's fine because I don't, Loki is going to be bringing a laptop to the show, but we don't know if it's actually going to work or what the deal is going to be on this as of yet.

3124
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:33,000
So we'll see. He's bringing it as, like, a test to see if we can do it. But right now, man, I hit the button to answer the call, and the iPad is still thinking, still thinking, and hopefully it's picking up.

3125
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:44,000
Or this is just a feature, if you will, of our internet right now. Okay, I tried to take that call and it didn't go through. Let me try one more time and see if it'll connect.

3126
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:46,000
It just works.

3127
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:56,000
I know, right? Maybe this is tied to the reason our thing keeps, uh, no, it keeps ending. As soon as I pick it up, it's, like, immediately the call ends.

3128
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:58,000
Is something popping up on the monitor?

3129
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:06,000
It is. Okay, so, wait, are the calls coming, oh my god, are the calls coming in on the PC finally?

3130
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:12,000
This may actually not be the end of the world. Let's see what happens.

3131
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:20,000
Okay, let's try it. Live radio and the joys of it, boys and girls. Let's try going to the phones. Hi, you're on Orange House Radio, who's this?

3132
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:23,000
This is just proof that the concept actually works.

3133
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:34,000
Okay, so, I want you all to hear a fun story. So, Skype, been broken on the PC for the last, how many weeks, three, four weeks, right?

3134
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:41,000
So I've been using my iPad to work around it, right? So here I am on my iPad, JD points out tonight, what's that popping up on your monitor?

3135
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:49,000
So, Skype works tonight, on the computer, like it did a month ago, just out of the blue.

3136
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:50,000
Look.

3137
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:53,000
You know what I changed, Rama? Not a goddamn thing.

3138
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:55,000
Rama.

3139
02:44:55,000 --> 02:45:00,000
Sunspots. It's sunspots, yes. Is it a full moon?

3140
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:02,000
Something.

3141
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:08,000
So, DJ, Rama, what would you like to call, what would you like to talk to us about tonight on your call?

3142
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:13,000
A few things, I'll get, I'll make these as brief as possible so that other people can call in.

3143
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:16,000
But as for the issue with Skype, yeah, we've had our own issues.

3144
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:23,000
Marco has had to reboot a couple of times just to get into the, into the Skype call with us.

3145
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:28,000
So, we're like, okay, if this, if this shit keeps up, we're going to go to Discord.

3146
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:32,000
I'm the jury rig, Skype and Discord make this shit work, one way or another.

3147
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:37,000
Because evidently, Skype works for me, but for her, it's like, no.

3148
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:42,000
Yeah, more and more people are starting to podcast through Discord, I'm finding, which is interesting.

3149
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:47,000
But I tell you what, Discord is great for audio. Video, not so much.

3150
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:53,000
I have my little tablet, I'm with a friend, we go into Discord video, it crashed my little tablet.

3151
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:58,000
Meanwhile, I can do Skype video on my tablet. Works great. No problems.

3152
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:01,000
Yeah, video is still new for Discord, so I'll give him that.

3153
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:05,000
And Discord, like, does a lot for free, so I'll give him a pass.

3154
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:09,000
But yeah, maybe not the number one option for video right now.

3155
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:11,000
Yeah, definitely.

3156
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:17,000
But, yeah, I'm seeing Facebook last week, everybody's coming out about the harassment issues.

3157
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:22,000
And let me tell you, one person in the community around here said,

3158
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:29,000
I believe you got dragged harder than anybody I have ever seen because this person is known for some stuff.

3159
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:31,000
And I'm just going to leave it at that.

3160
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:38,000
And I just hope that this person realizes, after what he said, and the backlash he got for it,

3161
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:42,000
he realizes how much in the wrong he is, and he does make amends to be a better person.

3162
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:51,000
Well, let's just all hope everyone decides to be better people, but change needs to happen. I think that's evident.

3163
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:55,000
Because even I made posts about my transgressions and how I'm going to be a better person.

3164
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:57,000
Good for you, man.

3165
02:46:57,000 --> 02:47:05,000
And the last thing is, this whole Magfest, Inner Harbor, DC bullshit.

3166
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:13,000
Man, listen, I had a conversation with one of the staffers about Magfest at Comic Con during dinner with a friend.

3167
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:17,000
I almost jumped across the table with his bullshit excuses.

3168
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:21,000
We can chat later about that, but I will say this.

3169
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:25,000
It takes me about four hours to get to DC.

3170
02:47:25,000 --> 02:47:38,000
I've got to spend an extra half hour either through a bus that runs every hour from Metro Station to whatever the hotel is,

3171
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:42,000
or wait around and try to get an Uber or a Lyft over there.

3172
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:49,000
And yes, to be perfectly honest, with the numbers that Magfest is getting, it doesn't seem to be that crowded.

3173
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:55,000
But I will say this, if they ever have to move, they can just move to the Reagan Convention Center right there in DC,

3174
02:47:55,000 --> 02:48:03,000
because there is a hotel right across the street with an underground walkway path, and there's like five hotels within a two-block radius.

3175
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:11,000
But the big problem with moving to an established convention center like that, it's very hard to run a 24-hour con in those places sometimes.

3176
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:12,000
True.

3177
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:15,000
And I think a lot of people would be very upset if Magfest wasn't 24 hours.

3178
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:22,000
Yeah, and I get that. It kind of goes back to the first time I went to Fandame and me and Drunami.

3179
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:32,000
We got up at like 3.45 in the morning. No, actually, I think I got up at like 3 o'clock in the morning and dragged him along to go see a viewing of true Naruto style of the movie.

3180
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:37,000
And I was more hyped about the fact that this is a convention center that's open 24 hours.

3181
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:41,000
Where have you been my entire life? And stuff like that does not exist here.

3182
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:44,000
Once it hits 2 a.m., get out.

3183
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:50,000
Yeah, San Jose Convention Center is a little unique in that, and I think it's because the hotel practically is like inside.

3184
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:54,000
The hotel is so connected to the convention center, I think it lets him get away with a little more.

3185
02:48:54,000 --> 02:49:00,000
Because not the entire convention center is open 24 hours, just kind of that wing near the hotels.

3186
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:04,000
Okay, see, that's cool. If they could do something like that, that would work.

3187
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:13,000
And besides, as big as I think the Marriott is right next to the Reagan Convention Center, they could put a few arcade machines in and do some 24-hour stuff. It's plausible.

3188
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:20,000
Maybe there's other ways to think about it, because the concert hall doesn't need to be 24 hours. They don't run concerts 24 hours.

3189
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:28,000
So maybe that's something that's in the convention center, and maybe some of the things that are more on a time, like panels and things would be over there too.

3190
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:32,000
And then, yeah, the arcades try to fit it in the hotel somewhere.

3191
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:44,000
I kind of feel like MAGFest isn't really listening to that they need to figure out how to solve this problem, and that could mean they need to change location.

3192
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:52,000
I mean, they might be locked into the Gaylord for a couple more years. I think that's really what it boils down to, is that they're under contract to do this there a few more years.

3193
02:49:53,000 --> 02:49:59,000
It's that too, but I will say this. This will probably explain a lot of stuff.

3194
02:49:59,000 --> 02:50:07,000
Despite all the issues with MAGFest, according to the contract, he doesn't really give a damn.

3195
02:50:07,000 --> 02:50:15,000
Because he knows for a fact, as popular as this con is, people will still show up so they don't really care.

3196
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:18,000
Until they don't anymore.

3197
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:30,000
Which is true, but right now I can't think of anything else, and within my squad of people, we're like, well, you got MAGFest, and you got PAX, and we're like, why God, why?

3198
02:50:32,000 --> 02:50:37,000
Alright, well, we'll see what happens after this year and the feedback they're gonna get.

3199
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:41,000
Yeah, because after this year, come 2019, I'm going to CES.

3200
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:43,000
Ooh, that'd be a fun show.

3201
02:50:43,000 --> 02:50:49,000
Oh, yes indeed. I said no, after the bullshit with the badges and the bullshit with the whole, no.

3202
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:56,000
No, no, I went through this shit once with PAX East. I am not going through this shit again.

3203
02:50:56,000 --> 02:51:06,000
I'd rather take time off, go to Vegas, meet up with some friends, have a good time, and enjoy myself, instead of having to deal with this type of stress. Nope, not happening.

3204
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:08,000
Yeah, I hear you on that.

3205
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:11,000
Alright, Rama, I'm gonna let you go try squeezing some more calls, but thanks for your call.

3206
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:13,000
Got it, man. Oh, yeah, by the way, Rob?

3207
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:14,000
Yes.

3208
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:15,000
Stay black, man.

3209
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:17,000
I will do my very best.

3210
02:51:17,000 --> 02:51:18,000
Awesome.

3211
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:19,000
Alright, bye.

3212
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:20,000
Bye.

3213
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:30,000
Orange Launch Radio, all one word on Skype. Let's see if we can get to another call. Hopefully, it's gonna connect magically on the PC. Once again, hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

3214
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:33,000
Yeah, this is Raginator.

3215
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:35,000
Hey, Raginator. What's on your mind tonight? How you doing?

3216
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:46,000
Well, I would rather not get into that. It's not show worthy, but anyway, just got two quick topics real quick.

3217
02:51:46,000 --> 02:51:47,000
Sure.

3218
02:51:48,000 --> 02:52:10,000
Anyway, I know it's not something you normally cover on the show per se, but it is game related. For those that are into pen and paper RPGs, there is actually a book bundle on Humble Bundle right now.

3219
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:30,000
I think it's due to expire in like two days, but I think it's, if I'm looking at this right, there's some kind of series called Pathfinder. I'm not really familiar with that, but for those that are familiar with the series or maybe interested, it might be worth it. I don't know.

3220
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:53,000
Yeah, I think that's what Ian Rama just lit up in chat. Ooh, Pathfinder. I think that's a pretty clever thing to give away in the book bundle is books about role playing games. Heck, I remember, you know, I didn't get super into D&D, but I certainly had those trips to Barnes and Noble back in the day where like some of my friends wanted to buy like a Dungeon Master Guide or a expansion book or whatever it is. I think it's a pretty clever thing to give away. Heck yeah.

3221
02:52:53,000 --> 02:53:07,000
Those books can be expensive, so that's a really good idea. Plus it's like the biggest obstacle to getting into role playing is not having the books. And a lot of people's solution is just, oh, go pirate it because they're easy and they're online. But like having them like legit available is really good.

3222
02:53:07,000 --> 02:53:09,000
Yeah, for sure.

3223
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:23,000
Secondly, before I let you go and again take more calls, I just want to chime in about the whole microtransaction thing that's been going on.

3224
02:53:23,000 --> 02:53:37,000
You know, I can see microtransactions in the free to play games, be it Dota 2 or whatever. Those games are free. The developers need to make money somehow.

3225
02:53:37,000 --> 02:53:53,000
And, you know, I know there's a lot of people that don't see a single penny to those games, but there are those people that, you know, tend to spend a lot of money on the game over time.

3226
02:53:53,000 --> 02:54:05,000
You know, they kind of use the mentality, you know, oh, it's just a dollar here, just a dollar there. Over time, you're probably going to spend more than 60 bucks on that kind of game, you know.

3227
02:54:05,000 --> 02:54:17,000
But in terms of games that you're already actually paying $60 plus upfront, I think it's a little overkill. What do you think?

3228
02:54:18,000 --> 02:54:29,000
Well, I mean, I think you've probably heard Logie's opinion pretty loud and strong is that I think it's a very similar kind of concept is that, well, if the game's free to play, then of course they're paying for it somehow.

3229
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:41,000
Loot boxes are expected, but it's a little crappy. It's a lot of crappy. When you're paying 60 bucks for what? What am I paying 60 bucks for if then all this other stuff ends up being behind the gate?

3230
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:52,000
Is the value of a $60 game getting diminished because you're not really, you're getting what, five maps in Battlefront with your 60 bucks, just have all this other stuff, you know, gated, even though I know that's not loot boxes.

3231
02:54:52,000 --> 02:55:00,000
But still, I think that's kind of what the point boils down to really at the end of the day is that the value of what a $60 game is is diminishing with a lot of this stuff.

3232
02:55:00,000 --> 02:55:06,000
Now, granted, that's where we had the email earlier tonight from Martin going, well, then why not charge $80 for a game?

3233
02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:12,000
And, you know, since, you know, clearly that's what they want is they want more money from the game, but it is a slippery slope.

3234
02:55:12,000 --> 02:55:25,000
And then indie developers are able to make bang up games for 20 bucks. Hell, sometimes five bucks, depending on, you know, where you're going for the experience and what it is you're looking for.

3235
02:55:25,000 --> 02:55:36,000
Um, it's, it's just, it's, it's a very interesting kind of crossroads in this industry, but I have a feeling, RageNator, at the end of the day, you know, we always say vote with your wallet.

3236
02:55:36,000 --> 02:55:48,000
And I think more and more of these single player games with this stuff locked behind it are going to get outed on places like Twitter, and it's going to impact the bottom line of a game.

3237
02:55:48,000 --> 02:55:56,000
It's different when it's like the cosmetic stuff and the stuff we've kind of seen so far, like what Overwatch does and all of that, because we've kind of all accepted it.

3238
02:55:56,000 --> 02:56:04,000
And the people that are crazy about Overwatch still pay money for the loot boxes and all right, cool, that's where they're making the money.

3239
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:27,000
But I think if people really start to push back against the whole, like, content behind this, I think you're going to see developers probably implement it less because developers don't want to spend 60 million dollars developing their game just to have the internet take a giant shit on it. Ask fans of Mass Effect about that one.

3240
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:42,000
Yeah, and on a related note, you know, you brought up, you know, I figured whether it was you or Loki, but, you know, you brought up the fun factor versus graphics, and I totally agree.

3241
02:56:42,000 --> 02:57:06,000
I mean, you know, if you're talking about, like, you know, the 80s and 90s, then, you know, back then, you know, when you saw leaps and bounds in graphics, you know, like from the Atari to the NES or NES to the Super Nintendo, then, yeah, you can, you know, make arguments about the whole wow factor.

3242
02:57:06,000 --> 02:57:22,000
You know, hell, you know, when I first saw a video of, you know, Super Castlevania IV, you know, I was wowed by that, but at the same time, you know, nowadays, we're getting to the whole diminishing returns things.

3243
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:47,000
Are we, though? Because, you know, now games are going to 4K, and even, you know, I don't know if I see, like, a huge, huge difference in 4K, but, like, I know the refresh rate is one that's really wowed me, is that now that, you know, you have more TVs with a 60 hertz refresh rate, and, you know, you're seeing that in more games, like, that higher frame rate is, like, really impressive, and it makes things almost look even more like real life.

3244
02:57:47,000 --> 02:57:59,000
And, yeah, I can really see the difference between something that was on PlayStation 3 and, you know, now PlayStation 4, and especially Xbox One X at this point, and those Forza trailers and things like that.

3245
02:57:59,000 --> 02:58:08,000
So just when you wonder, and you know what we say here on OLR, just when you wonder how they're going to push it one step further, everything's one step closer to the holodeck.

3246
02:58:08,000 --> 02:58:13,000
Gaming doesn't end until we have the holodeck.

3247
02:58:13,000 --> 02:58:14,000
Yeah, good point.

3248
02:58:14,000 --> 02:58:15,000
All right.

3249
02:58:15,000 --> 02:58:19,000
Well, I'm going to let you go so you can take more calls, but thanks for taking my call.

3250
02:58:19,000 --> 02:58:20,000
You're welcome.

3251
02:58:20,000 --> 02:58:21,000
Have a good one.

3252
02:58:21,000 --> 02:58:22,000
Have a good one.

3253
02:58:22,000 --> 02:58:23,000
Take care of yourself.

3254
02:58:23,000 --> 02:58:24,000
Bye-bye.

3255
02:58:25,000 --> 02:58:26,000
All right.

3256
02:58:26,000 --> 02:58:29,000
But I was going to mention, since you mentioned, you know, everything's going towards the holodeck.

3257
02:58:29,000 --> 02:58:30,000
Yeah.

3258
02:58:30,000 --> 02:58:34,000
What's the holodeck adding to gaming versus what we have now?

3259
02:58:34,000 --> 02:58:37,000
Better experience, better gameplay.

3260
02:58:37,000 --> 02:58:41,000
Once again, that is the most important thing when it comes to a game.

3261
02:58:41,000 --> 02:58:44,000
Completely immersive pornography.

3262
02:58:44,000 --> 02:58:45,000
Well, yes.

3263
02:58:45,000 --> 02:58:48,000
That is also the end game, yes.

3264
02:58:48,000 --> 02:58:50,000
And completely assertive pornography.

3265
02:58:50,000 --> 02:58:51,000
Yeah.

3266
02:58:51,000 --> 02:59:01,000
Just think what the holodeck is going to do to the prostitution and rent boy industry when that comes out, and it's that immersive.

3267
02:59:01,000 --> 02:59:02,000
Hey, look, a call.

3268
02:59:02,000 --> 02:59:03,000
Just think about that.

3269
02:59:03,000 --> 02:59:04,000
I know.

3270
02:59:04,000 --> 02:59:05,000
Hey, look, a call.

3271
02:59:05,000 --> 02:59:06,000
It's saving us from porn discussion.

3272
02:59:06,000 --> 02:59:08,000
And this will probably be it for the night.

3273
02:59:08,000 --> 02:59:09,000
So, hi, you're on Orange on Trady.

3274
02:59:09,000 --> 02:59:10,000
Who's this?

3275
02:59:10,000 --> 02:59:11,000
Hey, what's up?

3276
02:59:11,000 --> 02:59:12,000
This is Kaijuto.

3277
02:59:12,000 --> 02:59:13,000
Hey, Kaijuto.

3278
02:59:13,000 --> 02:59:14,000
What's on your mind, my friend?

3279
02:59:14,000 --> 02:59:15,000
Actually, I'm going to answer the porn conversation.

3280
02:59:15,000 --> 02:59:19,000
You know that PlayStation VR, you can check out porn now.

3281
02:59:19,000 --> 02:59:20,000
It's pretty...

3282
02:59:20,000 --> 02:59:22,000
That's all I'm going to say.

3283
02:59:22,000 --> 02:59:23,000
I enjoyed it.

3284
02:59:23,000 --> 02:59:24,000
But...

3285
02:59:24,000 --> 02:59:25,000
Fair enough.

3286
02:59:25,000 --> 02:59:26,000
Yeah, but noted.

3287
02:59:26,000 --> 02:59:27,000
The porn selection is important.

3288
02:59:27,000 --> 02:59:28,000
Yeah, stay in the...

3289
02:59:28,000 --> 02:59:29,000
Noted.

3290
02:59:29,000 --> 02:59:30,000
Dark Tetsuya, put that on the wiki.

3291
02:59:30,000 --> 02:59:32,000
Kaijuto called to talk in about porn.

3292
02:59:32,000 --> 02:59:33,000
Thank you.

3293
02:59:33,000 --> 02:59:34,000
All right.

3294
02:59:35,000 --> 02:59:42,200
But really, to be honest with you, we've all been watching porn since we were kids.

3295
02:59:42,200 --> 02:59:50,000
And when I watched porn in VR, it was like watching porn for the first time again, man.

3296
02:59:50,000 --> 02:59:51,000
Amazing.

3297
02:59:51,000 --> 02:59:52,000
I just...

3298
02:59:52,000 --> 02:59:53,000
Anyway...

3299
02:59:53,000 --> 02:59:54,000
We've been watching porn since we were kids.

3300
02:59:54,000 --> 02:59:55,000
I was 18.

3301
02:59:55,000 --> 02:59:56,000
Thank you very much.

3302
02:59:56,000 --> 02:59:58,000
Am I the only one that caught that?

3303
02:59:58,000 --> 02:59:59,000
No.

3304
02:59:59,000 --> 03:00:00,000
All right.

3305
03:00:00,000 --> 03:00:03,000
Maybe not all of us, but I was.

3306
03:00:03,000 --> 03:00:04,000
But...

3307
03:00:04,000 --> 03:00:05,000
What was I calling about?

3308
03:00:05,000 --> 03:00:06,000
Oh, yeah.

3309
03:00:06,000 --> 03:00:07,000
So...

3310
03:00:07,000 --> 03:00:08,000
VR porn.

3311
03:00:08,000 --> 03:00:12,000
What were you originally calling about before this show literally went to hell?

3312
03:00:12,000 --> 03:00:15,000
No, I was actually calling about VR.

3313
03:00:15,000 --> 03:00:18,000
I wanted to recommend two games to Loki.

3314
03:00:18,000 --> 03:00:24,000
If you haven't heard me on Black Wolf, you got to try Smashbox Battle Arena and Spark.

3315
03:00:24,000 --> 03:00:27,000
Those are two of the best VR games ever played.

3316
03:00:27,000 --> 03:00:29,000
Like multiplayer VR games.

3317
03:00:29,000 --> 03:00:30,000
Amazing, man.

3318
03:00:30,000 --> 03:00:31,000
So much fun.

3319
03:00:31,000 --> 03:00:32,000
I'm gonna say...

3320
03:00:32,000 --> 03:00:33,000
Why?

3321
03:00:33,000 --> 03:00:35,000
Oh, because it's crazy fun, man.

3322
03:00:35,000 --> 03:00:39,000
It's like you feel like you're actually out with a group of people and enjoy...

3323
03:00:39,000 --> 03:00:44,000
Remember when you were a kid and you would play dodgeball or you would go to the rec center?

3324
03:00:44,000 --> 03:00:46,000
You feel like you're doing all that stuff in VR.

3325
03:00:46,000 --> 03:00:47,000
No lie.

3326
03:00:47,000 --> 03:00:52,000
I mean, you legit feel like you're out in a community of people and you're interacting

3327
03:00:52,000 --> 03:00:54,000
and you're doing stuff and you're playing these sports games.

3328
03:00:54,000 --> 03:00:55,000
Oh, hooray.

3329
03:00:55,000 --> 03:00:56,000
It's just a lot of fun.

3330
03:00:56,000 --> 03:00:58,000
Can I get picked last in this too?

3331
03:00:58,000 --> 03:01:02,000
Actually, in Smashbox Arena, it is something like that.

3332
03:01:02,000 --> 03:01:03,000
I remember watching a review.

3333
03:01:03,000 --> 03:01:07,000
Somebody reviewed Smashbox Arena and they said that they felt like they were a kid in

3334
03:01:07,000 --> 03:01:11,000
the playground again being picked because they actually do have a picking system.

3335
03:01:11,000 --> 03:01:14,000
It's three versus three in Smashbox Arena.

3336
03:01:14,000 --> 03:01:17,000
So if you want to be on the blue team, there's only two teams, blue and orange.

3337
03:01:17,000 --> 03:01:20,000
If you want to be on the orange team, you have to stand in the orange box.

3338
03:01:20,000 --> 03:01:24,000
And if somebody doesn't want to be on your team, they'll jump over to the blue box and

3339
03:01:24,000 --> 03:01:27,000
you just get that feeling of, oh, they think I suck.

3340
03:01:27,000 --> 03:01:28,000
Yeah.

3341
03:01:28,000 --> 03:01:31,000
Bobby Blackwater says, this is not selling me on this game.

3342
03:01:31,000 --> 03:01:32,000
Yeah.

3343
03:01:32,000 --> 03:01:37,000
Well, let's focus less on getting picked last and let's talk about the fun factor.

3344
03:01:37,000 --> 03:01:41,000
If you have an option that if you don't stand in the box, it'll auto sign you to a team.

3345
03:01:41,000 --> 03:01:44,000
So you don't have to go through that humiliation if you don't want to.

3346
03:01:44,000 --> 03:01:45,000
Okay.

3347
03:01:45,000 --> 03:01:46,000
Fair enough.

3348
03:01:46,000 --> 03:01:47,000
Some of us like that.

3349
03:01:47,000 --> 03:01:48,000
It's fun.

3350
03:01:48,000 --> 03:01:49,000
Okay.

3351
03:01:49,000 --> 03:01:50,000
You ended that well.

3352
03:01:50,000 --> 03:01:51,000
Good.

3353
03:01:51,000 --> 03:01:52,000
All right.

3354
03:01:52,000 --> 03:01:58,000
Are the games pre-constructed or is it more like you just have a big sandbox where you

3355
03:01:58,000 --> 03:01:59,000
can do anything?

3356
03:01:59,000 --> 03:02:02,000
It's kind of like a combination of both.

3357
03:02:02,000 --> 03:02:04,000
With Smashbox Arena, they put you...

3358
03:02:04,000 --> 03:02:06,000
I can't remember how many arenas they are.

3359
03:02:06,000 --> 03:02:08,000
They might be over maybe five right now.

3360
03:02:08,000 --> 03:02:10,000
I think they said they're going to add more to it.

3361
03:02:10,000 --> 03:02:15,000
But they put you in this little box arena and each box has a theme.

3362
03:02:15,000 --> 03:02:17,000
One, you're at a construction site.

3363
03:02:17,000 --> 03:02:20,000
Another one, you're at a space station.

3364
03:02:20,000 --> 03:02:23,000
There's one that looks like you're out in Arizona somewhere.

3365
03:02:23,000 --> 03:02:28,000
And what happens is you hear an announcer and they say, they count down and then they

3366
03:02:28,000 --> 03:02:29,000
say, ready, go.

3367
03:02:29,000 --> 03:02:32,000
And then when they say go, they drop all these balls out of the sky.

3368
03:02:32,000 --> 03:02:35,000
So basically, that's how you get your ammunition for your gun.

3369
03:02:35,000 --> 03:02:37,000
You have to run and collect the ball.

3370
03:02:37,000 --> 03:02:39,000
You can only collect two at a time.

3371
03:02:39,000 --> 03:02:44,000
You have to collect this ball and then teleport around and dodge balls that other people are

3372
03:02:44,000 --> 03:02:46,000
shooting at you, try to shoot another person with your ball.

3373
03:02:46,000 --> 03:02:51,000
They also have these special balls, like one special wall.

3374
03:02:51,000 --> 03:02:58,000
They have a sniper gun.

3375
03:02:58,000 --> 03:03:00,000
They have the usual stuff you'll find in a first-person shooter, like a sniper gun.

3376
03:03:00,000 --> 03:03:05,000
They have this other thing that shoots this big Indiana Jones boulder-looking thing at

3377
03:03:05,000 --> 03:03:06,000
your opponents, which is really funny.

3378
03:03:06,000 --> 03:03:08,000
It's fun to get caught by that.

3379
03:03:08,000 --> 03:03:13,000
You're just out there and out of nowhere, this big giant ball comes rolling you over.

3380
03:03:13,000 --> 03:03:14,000
It's just a lot of fun.

3381
03:03:14,000 --> 03:03:18,000
And then there's teleportation in the game, which also, I don't know, it kind of adds

3382
03:03:18,000 --> 03:03:20,000
to the charm of the game.

3383
03:03:20,000 --> 03:03:23,000
The game looks like crap, by the way, just if you go to look it up.

3384
03:03:23,000 --> 03:03:27,000
It looks terrible, but I don't know, there's a charm about it that I really like.

3385
03:03:27,000 --> 03:03:32,000
I'll not explain it, but when you spawn, you throw this little spinning top thing.

3386
03:03:32,000 --> 03:03:34,000
And that's how you know where you're going to land.

3387
03:03:34,000 --> 03:03:38,000
That's how you point in what direction you want to go to, and a little spinning thing

3388
03:03:38,000 --> 03:03:41,000
pops out, and then you spawn in that direction.

3389
03:03:41,000 --> 03:03:43,000
You have to move around with the move controllers.

3390
03:03:43,000 --> 03:03:47,000
I don't know, it sounds crazy, but it's a fun game.

3391
03:03:47,000 --> 03:03:50,000
I never had that much fun in VR.

3392
03:03:50,000 --> 03:03:51,000
It sounds interesting.

3393
03:03:51,000 --> 03:03:54,000
The only thing that might be souring me a little bit on it is that you said there's

3394
03:03:54,000 --> 03:03:56,000
a stage that's Arizona.

3395
03:03:56,000 --> 03:03:59,000
Why would I go into VR just to go to Arizona?

3396
03:03:59,000 --> 03:04:01,000
Well, it looks like that to me.

3397
03:04:01,000 --> 03:04:06,000
Any time I see orange mountains and that type of thing, I always think of Arizona for some

3398
03:04:06,000 --> 03:04:07,000
reason.

3399
03:04:07,000 --> 03:04:10,000
But to someone else, it could be Stonehenge, it could be whatever, because they do have

3400
03:04:10,000 --> 03:04:11,000
grass in there.

3401
03:04:11,000 --> 03:04:15,000
It's so you can see how pretty Arizona can be without having to deal with triple digit

3402
03:04:15,000 --> 03:04:16,000
heat.

3403
03:04:16,000 --> 03:04:17,000
I guess that's fair.

3404
03:04:17,000 --> 03:04:18,000
All right.

3405
03:04:18,000 --> 03:04:19,000
Can I shoot him, my friend?

3406
03:04:19,000 --> 03:04:22,000
I'm going to let you go so we wrap up the show, but thank you for your discussion on

3407
03:04:22,000 --> 03:04:24,000
raining balls and porn.

3408
03:04:24,000 --> 03:04:27,000
Yes, Smashbox Arena and Spark.

3409
03:04:27,000 --> 03:04:29,000
Two games you can't go wrong with, trust me.

3410
03:04:29,000 --> 03:04:30,000
PSVR, get them.

3411
03:04:30,000 --> 03:04:32,000
All right, take care, my friend.

3412
03:04:32,000 --> 03:04:33,000
All right.

3413
03:04:33,000 --> 03:04:35,000
That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

3414
03:04:35,000 --> 03:04:39,000
If you didn't get through and you want to in the future, you can call us next week,

3415
03:04:39,000 --> 03:04:41,000
because apparently Skype works again magically.

3416
03:04:41,000 --> 03:04:43,000
Or you can always send us an email.

3417
03:04:43,000 --> 03:04:47,000
Participate at OrangeLawnTrader.com is the best place to send your emails.

3418
03:04:47,000 --> 03:04:49,000
We'll read some more of those next week.

3419
03:04:49,000 --> 03:04:53,000
In the meantime, we do have to wrap up the show for the night, but I got to go around

3420
03:04:53,000 --> 03:04:54,000
and get everybody's final thoughts first.

3421
03:04:54,000 --> 03:04:57,000
First, I'm going to say thank you as always for listening to the show.

3422
03:04:57,000 --> 03:05:01,000
Thank you for downloading the show, and we really appreciate you taking the time to check

3423
03:05:01,000 --> 03:05:02,000
out OLR.

3424
03:05:02,000 --> 03:05:05,000
If you enjoyed what you heard here at OLR, please tell a friend or five about the show.

3425
03:05:05,000 --> 03:05:08,000
Help us spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

3426
03:05:08,000 --> 03:05:12,000
Every gamer has a voice when, you know, the voices are here to air.

3427
03:05:12,000 --> 03:05:14,000
Yeah, five-star reviews on places like iTunes.

3428
03:05:14,000 --> 03:05:16,000
Those go a long way as well.

3429
03:05:16,000 --> 03:05:19,000
So definitely can always use those.

3430
03:05:19,000 --> 03:05:22,000
We'll be back, of course, to do this all again next week in seven days.

3431
03:05:22,000 --> 03:05:26,000
Although our pal Bobby will not be here next week, we will be here next week.

3432
03:05:26,000 --> 03:05:30,000
And I'm likely to have a hoarse voice as I'm hosting Rocky Horror next Saturday.

3433
03:05:30,000 --> 03:05:32,000
And you always know when I come in the day after that, I'm like,

3434
03:05:32,000 --> 03:05:35,000
I've got an orange lantern right here.

3435
03:05:35,000 --> 03:05:36,000
So that'll be fun.

3436
03:05:36,000 --> 03:05:38,000
Anyway, final thoughts for now.

3437
03:05:38,000 --> 03:05:39,000
JD, thank you for being here.

3438
03:05:39,000 --> 03:05:41,000
I'm sorry because of the mic situation.

3439
03:05:41,000 --> 03:05:43,000
We didn't get to hear from you a lot at the beginning of the show, but at least we got

3440
03:05:43,000 --> 03:05:46,000
you to fill in here a little bit at the back half, but always good to have you here.

3441
03:05:46,000 --> 03:05:47,000
Yeah, it was fun.

3442
03:05:47,000 --> 03:05:48,000
Thank you.

3443
03:05:48,000 --> 03:05:50,000
Anything you want to plug while you're here?

3444
03:05:50,000 --> 03:05:52,000
Do you have a book you're writing?

3445
03:05:52,000 --> 03:05:54,000
Do you have a Twitch channel?

3446
03:05:54,000 --> 03:05:56,000
My ADHD is way too bad to write a book.

3447
03:05:56,000 --> 03:06:02,000
I do have a Twitch channel that has one saved stream on it, because I'm very new at this.

3448
03:06:03,000 --> 03:06:08,000
I think it's twitch.com slash J-A-I underscore D-I-T.

3449
03:06:08,000 --> 03:06:20,000
And I'm probably only going to do Cook, Serve, Delicious too, unless someone has requests or something.

3450
03:06:20,000 --> 03:06:25,000
I'm probably not going to stream coming out on top or anything, because that probably breaks the Twitch rules.

3451
03:06:25,000 --> 03:06:33,000
But yeah, I also have a Twitter with the same username, and I try to be funny.

3452
03:06:33,000 --> 03:06:34,000
Fantastic.

3453
03:06:34,000 --> 03:06:37,000
All right, let's see.

3454
03:06:37,000 --> 03:06:40,000
Let's go over to Loki and your final thought tonight.

3455
03:06:40,000 --> 03:06:43,000
My final thought is I did have one last minute story.

3456
03:06:43,000 --> 03:06:44,000
Oh, oops.

3457
03:06:44,000 --> 03:06:45,000
I forgot to look for those.

3458
03:06:45,000 --> 03:06:46,000
Sorry.

3459
03:06:46,000 --> 03:06:52,000
So real quick, the Steam holiday sale dates have been leaked, so you can expect the Steam

3460
03:06:52,000 --> 03:06:59,000
Halloween sale to run from October 26th to November 1st, the Black Friday sale from November 22nd to November 28th,

3461
03:06:59,000 --> 03:07:04,000
and finally the winter sale from December 21st to January 4th.

3462
03:07:04,000 --> 03:07:08,000
And then my final thought is Stranger Things is coming out on Friday.

3463
03:07:08,000 --> 03:07:09,000
Oh, yeah.

3464
03:07:09,000 --> 03:07:11,000
That's another thing to look forward to this week, huh?

3465
03:07:11,000 --> 03:07:12,000
Yes.

3466
03:07:12,000 --> 03:07:13,000
So I'm looking forward to that.

3467
03:07:13,000 --> 03:07:14,000
All right.

3468
03:07:14,000 --> 03:07:20,000
And my final thought tonight is I don't know.

3469
03:07:20,000 --> 03:07:24,000
I'm going to play more Pokémon, maybe, until I get distracted with Destiny.

3470
03:07:24,000 --> 03:07:25,000
That's for sure.

3471
03:07:25,000 --> 03:07:27,000
Are you finally going to finish a Pokémon game?

3472
03:07:27,000 --> 03:07:29,000
Let's not talk crazy now.

3473
03:07:29,000 --> 03:07:32,000
Because come Tuesday, it'll be, ooh, shiny, Destiny.

3474
03:07:32,000 --> 03:07:35,000
And then Friday, ooh, shinier, Mario Odyssey.

3475
03:07:35,000 --> 03:07:36,000
But this is Gen 2.

3476
03:07:36,000 --> 03:07:38,000
It's ooh, shiny, like, possibly.

3477
03:07:38,000 --> 03:07:39,000
I see what you did there.

3478
03:07:39,000 --> 03:07:40,000
I see what you did there.

3479
03:07:40,000 --> 03:07:43,000
All right, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

3480
03:07:43,000 --> 03:07:44,000
We will see you next week.

3481
03:07:44,000 --> 03:07:45,000
Bye bye.

3482
03:07:45,000 --> 03:07:49,000
