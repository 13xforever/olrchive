27000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	37000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37000	46000	It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight, episode number 705 of our show for this October the 22nd, 2017.
46000	54000	My name is Rob Roberts, joining you here over the next few hours to talk about video games with my pals, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
54000	60000	I don't know. I think I am equally in love with both Jason's and YYR's voices.
60000	61000	Yes.
61000	63000	Their voices are just so nice.
63000	68000	Yes. Big shout out to YYR who did some pinch hitting on the announce tonight. Jason's at TwitchCon.
68000	73000	Jason would be like Mr. Movie Phone or one of those movie announcers.
73000	85000	And then YYR would be like the guys I hear on NHK International who do like the bento show that I watch on NHK TV.
85000	88000	So do some Japanese documentaries for us please.
88000	94000	Or maybe the two of them should start a podcast. Wink Nudge. Maybe. Maybe that's an idea.
94000	95000	Voices.
95000	96000	Voices.
96000	97000	Voices of geeks.
97000	98000	Voices of geeks.
98000	100000	I don't think that name's taken. Alright.
100000	104000	Say hello as well to another geek voice over there. Techmaster Loki.
104000	105000	Hello.
105000	106000	Hi Loki. How are you?
106000	107000	Fine.
107000	108000	Yeah?
108000	110000	You sound kind of nervous. You alright?
110000	111000	I am perfectly fine.
111000	114000	Okay. That's good. That's good. How was your week?
114000	121000	It was alright. I don't know. It's uneventful. Lots of Legos. But uneventful.
121000	124000	Good. Yeah. I was at the mall yesterday. I was at the Lego store and I thought of you.
124000	127000	So, cause I was like oh it's Matt's favorite store.
127000	133000	Yeah. I really should have never gone into that Lego store the first time. Like I knew.
133000	137000	Stepping in there. God damn it. This is gonna be my life now.
137000	144000	I was actually there this weekend too. Picking up some parts. Cause my kids are so wonderful.
144000	151000	So they break and crack and lose pieces from my sets. And it's usually, it's not necessarily my sets.
151000	156000	It's the stuff I buy for them. And they're like oh it's missing. I'm like okay. I gotta go buy the replacement parts.
156000	160000	So thankfully there's an independent store nearby that they sell used Legos.
160000	163000	And so you just kind of sift through their bin to find what you're looking for.
163000	168000	So it cost me like two cents to replace the stuff. I'm like okay. Can't beat that.
168000	169000	Alright. Nice.
169000	172000	But they're doing birthday parties starting this week.
172000	174000	Woohoo. Birthday parties. More Legos.
174000	176000	And babysit kids and stuff. I'm like yes.
176000	180000	Alright. I also have to introduce here our old friend of the show is joining us tonight.
180000	184000	Sadly because of the mic issues we've had in studio recently I can't get him his own mic.
184000	188000	So we won't really hear from him a lot more till later. Cause Jamie's gonna only be here for half the show tonight.
188000	194000	Cause she has other things to tend to. But filling in a little later tonight and maybe a little bit at the top here too.
194000	196000	Say hi to JD is back.
196000	197000	Hey.
197000	202000	And how are you doing? What's new with you? What kind of like. I'll ask your gaming week later on.
202000	204000	But in a nutshell like how's gaming been treating you?
204000	207000	Pretty good. I've been enjoying my Switch a lot.
207000	212000	Oh that's right. Cause for a while you kind of skipped like a whole generation of consoles right.
212000	214000	But now you're like back in it with the Switch right?
214000	220000	Yeah I mean like I bought a Wii U in January and that was the first it had for like since I bought a Wii.
220000	223000	But yeah I got Switch at launch and I've just been really enjoying it.
223000	226000	Nice. What are like your top two games on Switch right now?
226000	235000	Right now. Splatoon and I guess I've been playing a lot of Konga Master Party.
236000	240000	Oh yeah yeah yeah. We were. You made me play that a little while ago. It was fun.
240000	245000	I'll ask you more about that during your gaming weeks. But I am here in a minute.
245000	251000	I'm going to get to. Actually we're going to talk to one of our pals. A friend of the show here at OLR.
251000	255000	We're going to talk to a user on Twitch named Fun John. Cause he's fun.
255000	260000	We're going to talk to him because he is at Twitch Con. Or was at Twitch Con cause Twitch Con is winding down.
260000	263000	I'm going to call him here shortly. I do want to do one quick housekeeping thing though.
263000	267000	I kind of just want to get this out of the way because it's kind of a downer slash negative.
267000	274000	But I have to get it off my chest because at the end of last week's show I referenced something about that Alan and I's cat wasn't doing so well.
274000	280000	I just did want to let you guys know we did unfortunately have to make the difficult choice to have her put to sleep on Monday.
280000	283000	Because she had a condition she was not going to recover from.
283000	288000	And the vet let us know that it was really really best for her well-being you know because she was in pain.
288000	295000	So after 17 and a half years with Sanrio we did have to make that difficult call this week.
295000	297000	So I just want to let you guys know that and update you on that.
297000	300000	And thank Jamie for being a part of Sanrio's life as well.
300000	308000	Cause every time Alan and I were out of town you were a very reliable substitute female influence on her life.
308000	309000	I'm a cat auntie.
309000	310000	Yes cat auntie.
311000	318000	Well and she actually let me give her scritches for like half a second before she you know waddled out away.
318000	322000	Yeah she usually hated people so I always said don't take it personally she just always runs and hides.
322000	324000	It takes her a good year to get to know people.
324000	331000	I found a video that I took one time when I was cat sitting that I think I forwarded to Alan.
331000	336000	But I have a couple of videos of her that I will make sure that you guys get.
336000	341000	Okay. Alright so again not to be too much of a downer but I do want to let you guys know that.
341000	344000	So let's go ahead and talk about video games. Get back into gaming.
344000	347000	And I know one thing exciting that happened this week was TwitchCon.
347000	351000	So we're going to actually try to get a hold of our pal who is at the TwitchCon event.
351000	353000	Cause sadly I didn't go to TwitchCon this year.
353000	356000	I went to TwitchCon I think it was the first year they did it.
356000	359000	I went to TwitchCon when it was in San Francisco.
359000	364000	But this year sadly I didn't get to go but I wanted to check in and see how the event is going.
364000	368000	So I believe on the line we have from Twitch our pal Fun John.
368000	370000	John you there?
370000	371000	Hey how you doing?
371000	374000	Hey I am great John. Thanks for coming on the show last minute.
374000	375000	Yeah no worries.
375000	378000	So you're down there at TwitchCon right? Or is it over?
378000	382000	It officially wraps in about 45-50 minutes.
382000	385000	I'm actually across the street from the convention center. They're doing the closing right now.
385000	388000	Gotcha. Well sorry to pull you away from that.
388000	393000	No worries. I think I'm done with standing on my feet and standing in line this weekend.
393000	395000	So I think I'm going to find some place to sit down.
395000	400000	Is it LineCon there? Is it lots and lots of standing in line like some cons are?
400000	405000	Unfortunately this year the theme has definitely been hashtag LineCon 2017.
405000	407000	It's really unfortunate.
407000	410000	Uh oh. Okay let me ask you actually quickly this question.
410000	413000	Are you more a streamer on Twitch or are you more a viewer on Twitch?
413000	416000	Like what was your motivation for going to TwitchCon?
416000	419000	I'm a little bit of both. I'm a very occasional streamer.
419000	422000	I'm trying to get more into it. I do a lot of watching people on Twitch.
422000	425000	I watch you. I watch some of the friends that I'm with here.
425000	428000	I watch some of the larger private streamers.
428000	435000	But I do stream occasionally. Mostly I try to stream to get some support for charity events like Extra Life and St. Jude and stuff like that.
435000	439000	Nice. Those are very worthy causes and I think make the whole streaming thing a lot cooler.
439000	443000	Did you find TwitchCon to be motivating?
443000	445000	Because I know the first year I was...
445000	450000	I probably am streaming on Twitch now because I went to TwitchCon that first year.
451000	455000	Yeah I really enjoyed it this year and I did find it motivating.
455000	460000	There's a lot of networking opportunities. There's a lot of opportunities to see what new games are coming out.
460000	465000	What companies are interested in making the streaming experience better.
465000	469000	There's streaming software, hardware vendors. Intel had a big booth there.
469000	475000	They were giving stuff away and they're also lauding the newer chips aimed towards gaming and streaming.
475000	479000	So I really think it was useful and it's definitely motivating.
479000	485000	They always have the charity corner where they have all the charities and the major organizations that are trying to raise money.
485000	489000	And they encourage people to use Twitch to help them do that.
489000	495000	And I personally enjoy going and talking to all of them and finding new opportunities where I can help out.
495000	501000	That is awesome. Since it is a gaming show and this is a gaming convention,
501000	505000	was there a lot of actual playable games there on the show floor?
505000	507000	Or was it more, these are more tools?
507000	514000	There are. There was a very large, well first of all there was the entire H1Z1 arena.
514000	522000	The big arena ball part of the convention center was just for the amateur and professional H1Z1 competitions the entire weekend.
522000	531000	There was a 40 seat player unknown battleground competition arena set up with HP and Omen.
531000	535000	They were doing the Omen challenge and they would let you, if you got in early enough in the morning,
535000	538000	you could sign up to play one of the tournaments.
538000	542000	They were doing 40 person duo tournaments for prizes.
542000	548000	But then there's also the smaller game companies, even the indie developers.
548000	552000	And they had lots of booth space out in the expo floor where you could play their games,
552000	556000	you could see demos, you could get codes for finished versions.
556000	560000	And it was even bigger than it was last year and I really like that too.
560000	562000	Were you able to attend many of the panels?
562000	565000	I know a lot of it was streaming out on the internet so we could all see it,
565000	569000	but did you go to any of the panels in person? What did you think?
569000	572000	Sadly, I did not make as many of the panels as I had intended.
572000	576000	There were a couple that I was super interested in,
576000	579000	but the ones I was really interested in were the ones that were happening first in the day.
579000	583000	And unfortunately, the entrance line was the one that got us most of the time.
583000	588000	Ah, I see. Oh, so it was slow just to get into the building?
588000	592000	So there's the east side entrance and the west side entrance.
592000	596000	Let's see, the west side entrance is where I am now and that was the short line,
596000	600000	but everybody was going to the east side entrance because that's where they picked up badges
600000	603000	and that's where everybody said, oh, go in on that side.
603000	610000	Yesterday it took me 45 or 50 minutes to get into the building at about 12 o'clock when it opened.
610000	614000	There were people who got here to the convention center at 8 a.m.
614000	617000	so that they could try to get into the Player Unknowns tournament.
617000	620000	They had to get here that early so they could be at the front of the line
620000	623000	and then race across the building to sign up.
623000	625000	I wonder if that's an issue that's going to need –
625000	627000	well, they seem to change venues every year,
627000	631000	so I wonder if that's going to be unique to that venue or if that's something you'll have to –
631000	634000	Yeah, I think the reason they change venues is size.
634000	636000	And I was wondering this myself.
636000	638000	The first year that I didn't go to was in San Francisco
638000	640000	because I didn't find out about it until about a month after it happened.
640000	645000	And last year I went down to San Diego and they had about half of the San Diego Convention Center.
645000	647000	This year they have the entire Long Beach Convention Center,
647000	650000	which is probably bigger than the one in San Diego.
650000	652000	So it has definitely grown in size.
652000	657000	If they stay here, they're definitely going to have to work through the resource management
657000	663000	and how fast they can get people in and out because the lines were just atrociously long.
663000	669000	It's definitely – I know they're going to invite people to provide feedback
669000	672000	after they get home and have a few days to think on it and stuff,
672000	675000	and I've got a list of some of the feedback I want to provide.
675000	679000	The top of it is those super long lines were just chilling the fun.
679000	681000	And not to say I had a lot of fun,
681000	684000	but it would have been a lot more fun if I hadn't had to stand in line so much.
684000	685000	Sure.
685000	691000	Now, those types of, like, methods of running a convention aside,
691000	696000	what would you like to most see at a TwitchCon 2018 that wasn't there this year?
697000	699000	Sorry, I didn't read. What was that?
699000	705000	Outside of those types of, like, the business of running things, sorts of things,
705000	709000	what would you most like to see at a TwitchCon 2018 that wasn't there this year?
712000	716000	I would really like to see – well, I'm not sure how much bigger it could get,
716000	719000	but I would really love to have seen the charity plaza be even bigger.
719000	721000	It was about the same size as it was last year.
721000	723000	I would kind of like to see Twitch –
724000	726000	I mean, you know, every year they add new features,
726000	729000	and a big part of TwitchCon is saying, okay, these are the features that are coming.
729000	734000	One of the things I would really like to see them do is double down on some of the charity and community efforts
734000	737000	and say, you know, not only are we adding these cool features for you,
737000	740000	but we're also doing these things to make it easier for people to raise money
740000	745000	or make it easier for people to host these kind of events that are, you know,
745000	750000	maybe not everybody – you know, obviously not everybody's on Twitch to raise money and do community work,
750000	755000	but there are those of us that feel very strongly about, you know, I want to raise money for Extra Life
755000	758000	because I personally benefited from a children's hospital when I was a kid,
758000	760000	and I want to pay that one forward.
760000	765000	You know, I'd really love to see Twitch do something, and obviously I don't know exactly what that would be,
765000	770000	but I'd love to see them do something, you know, make the impact bigger, you know,
770000	774000	make more space, find other ways to incentivize it.
775000	777000	You know, playable games is a really big thing here.
777000	780000	I know a lot of people come out here for playable games, and there's a ton of that.
780000	784000	People come out here to collect t-shirts and giveaways, and there's a lot of that.
784000	787000	So, I mean, you know, making those bigger just needs a bigger space,
787000	791000	but honestly I think one of the things I personally would like to see is them incentivizing
791000	797000	some of the non-traditional uses of Twitch just to keep it growing and becoming fresh everywhere else.
797000	801000	I think that is really good feedback. I hope Twitch actually listens to this.
801000	805000	I do want to acknowledge the chat room over at live.vognetwork.com
805000	807000	because I haven't given them a shout out yet tonight,
807000	809000	and they're putting up with some of our live chatters.
809000	812000	I don't know what's going on. We're having weird bandwidth issues tonight,
812000	815000	which I don't think is on our end because the Skype call is holding,
815000	818000	and Alan is in the back playing Overwatch, as he usually does during the show,
818000	821000	and those things are holding fine, but unfortunately we keep hiccuping on the live stream.
821000	824000	So thank you to the live listeners for putting up with that crap tonight.
824000	828000	I don't know what's going on, but I do want to say over in our chat at live.vognetwork.com,
828000	832000	Bobby is saying, I think it's interesting to have a convention like TwitchCon
832000	836000	where technically everyone is media, and Kaijuto follows that up with,
836000	840000	so does the media interview themselves at TwitchCon? That would be funny to watch.
840000	842000	Well, let me ask you this, Jon.
842000	848000	Are you meeting people there that you've only seen online,
848000	851000	and how is that experience of meeting people IRL?
851000	854000	Are they what you expect, or are they different, or what?
856000	859000	It totally is a lot of meeting people for the very first time.
859000	862000	I've been hanging around with a group of four or five people, and of them,
862000	866000	only one I had met in person before, and that was last year at TwitchCon in San Diego.
866000	871000	And that comment about, is the media interviewing themselves, it totally is.
871000	876000	On average, you would see 50 to 60 people at a time walking around the expo floor
876000	878000	live streaming on selfie sticks.
878000	881000	And of course, there were bandwidth issues in the convention center,
881000	884000	but if you had bandwidth, there were people doing it the entire weekend.
884000	889000	There were people live streaming expo floor, merch floor, all around the building.
889000	892000	Just even around town Thursday night before the convention even started,
892000	895000	we were at a bar hanging out with some friends, having dinner,
895000	899000	and three of the people there, three out of the 13 people there were live streaming.
899000	901000	They're followers.
901000	905000	Hanging out with their, bringing their followers to Long Beach,
905000	909000	the ones that couldn't actually make it here, and I think that's really awesome.
909000	911000	That is so neat.
911000	914000	That's just so interesting, that kind of world that we live in,
914000	917000	where everybody is streaming the same thing from three different points of view,
917000	919000	because that's the kind of convention it is.
919000	921000	That's so hilarious.
921000	924000	I do want to let you go here pretty soon so you can get back to the festivities,
924000	927000	but I want to end on a positive note, so let me ask this.
927000	931000	What was your favorite thing about TwitchCon this year?
931000	935000	You know, a lot of people have been asking me what brings you to TwitchCon,
935000	939000	and I've done a lot of thinking about that, and it really is a positive thing.
939000	941000	The positive thing is these people are my family.
941000	942000	They are part of my family.
942000	945000	You're part of my family because I've known you for several years,
945000	948000	and all the people that run in those circles, they're part of my family.
948000	950000	These people are my family too.
950000	953000	These are people that I hang out with when I'm working or I'm playing
953000	961000	and we're talking, and we share joys, we share griefs, we help each other out,
961000	965000	and I think the best part, honestly, the best part was that Friday was my birthday,
965000	968000	and coming to TwitchCon on my birthday was great,
968000	971000	and hanging out with all these different communities and people singing
971000	975000	and happy birthday to me and getting all the hugs.
975000	979000	All the lines of the world cannot destroy all the love and support I've gotten
979000	982000	from all these people that I call my friends and family this weekend,
982000	986000	and it's been overwhelming and amazing, and I'm going to be really sad
986000	989000	when I go home, and I can't wait until next year to do it again.
989000	991000	Well, Jon, I think next year I'm really going to try to join you.
991000	994000	Hopefully they have it in a place that's easy for me to get to,
994000	997000	but since I had to cut something from earlier in the year,
997000	1000000	one of my conventions I can't go to next year because of time,
1000000	1002000	it looks more likely I'll be able to do TwitchCon next year,
1002000	1006000	so I'm really looking forward to it, and I think that is a fantastic note to end this on.
1006000	1009000	Jon, thank you for taking time out during the convention to be here.
1009000	1013000	If you all want to follow Jon over on Twitch, keep tabs of his charity events
1013000	1018000	and some of the awesome people he follows, that's Fun Jon, F-U-N-J-O-N, am I correct?
1018000	1020000	Yeah, that's correct.
1020000	1022000	All right, anything else you want to plug while you're here?
1022000	1026000	Not really. I just thank you very much for the opportunity, and you have a great day.
1026000	1029000	You are welcome. Happy belated birthday from all of us here at OLR,
1029000	1033000	and send our love from OLR and VoG to all the peeps at TwitchCon.
1033000	1034000	Thanks, will do.
1034000	1035000	All right, take care, buddy.
1035000	1036000	Yep, bye-bye.
1036000	1037000	Bye.
1037000	1041000	Thanks again to Jon for taking time out of his TwitchCon to join us here.
1041000	1046000	I love that whole there's 13 people at dinner and three of them are livestreaming it,
1046000	1049000	but that is something that's kind of probably unique,
1049000	1052000	and I see Bobby in chat over at live.vognetwork.com talking about,
1053000	1058000	to be fair, Rob and I both get interviewed by other podcasters at DragonCon.
1058000	1062000	That's true, so there is a little bit of that, but it's not always livestreamed.
1062000	1066000	I guess the podcasting panels are livestreamed, but that's kind of different.
1066000	1070000	That's very different than dinner, but I'm totally not knocking it.
1070000	1075000	I just think it's a very interesting part of our culture and the world that we do that,
1075000	1081000	and that, like Jon says, the people who wish they could be there but can't be
1081000	1083000	really get to be a part of that experience.
1083000	1087000	And it almost makes me wonder, I know bandwidth is awful there,
1087000	1091000	but should we try to be livestreaming more of DragonCon somehow?
1091000	1094000	I don't know, but I know the cell phone networks all show up there.
1094000	1095000	Bring the hotspots.
1095000	1098000	That's right, right, or whatever we can do to get on those networks.
1098000	1100000	Anyway, thanks again, Jon, for taking the time out.
1100000	1103000	I do want to mention some of the things that Twitch did announce
1103000	1106000	as part of TwitchCon that I thought was really cool.
1106000	1109000	They did announce that they would be launching some new features,
1109000	1113000	including a stream summary, so once you're done with a stream, you can see,
1113000	1116000	like, did you get clipped, how many people watched it, all that stuff.
1116000	1118000	They're doing this thing called Premieres,
1118000	1121000	where they want to have organized first viewing events
1121000	1125000	to generate anticipation around viewership of new videos.
1125000	1128000	And that's probably more for people who do videos than it can,
1128000	1129000	like maybe YouTubers.
1129000	1133000	It's probably to attract some of the YouTubers to debut stuff live
1133000	1134000	and kind of get that reaction.
1134000	1136000	At least that's kind of what I'm getting out of it.
1136000	1140000	But I know people like a buddy of mine who was on this show
1140000	1142000	probably a year or two ago talking about some of his projects,
1142000	1147000	Matt Baum, who does a very popular podcast called Sewers of Paris.
1147000	1150000	And I know he's done some of these, like, he not only does Twitch,
1150000	1153000	but he does, like, the Dungeons and Drag Queens
1153000	1154000	and some of that stuff that he does.
1154000	1156000	Like, when I hear this, I think of, like, Matt,
1156000	1158000	and this would be a great platform for someone like him
1158000	1160000	who kind of dabbles in both to get to do that.
1160000	1164000	He also does, like, story time where he, like, reads a book and stuff like that.
1164000	1165000	It's a lot of fun.
1165000	1169000	Yeah, yeah. So, you know, people are using Twitch in very, very creative ways.
1169000	1172000	Let's see. And also they're talking about doing raids.
1172000	1177000	So you can actually use a slash raid to raid another channel.
1177000	1180000	And actually this kind of happened to me a couple weeks ago.
1180000	1183000	So I was doing an OLR post stream, as I usually do.
1183000	1185000	I did the Cuphead. It was that night.
1185000	1187000	So towards the end of my stream, I was like,
1187000	1189000	okay, this is the last time I'm going to run this level.
1189000	1193000	Somebody did a host with 83 viewers on my stream.
1193000	1195000	And I don't usually get that many viewers on my stream
1195000	1197000	because I'm still, you know, I don't stream enough
1197000	1199000	to have a huge following on there.
1199000	1201000	But, like, that was like, wow, oh my.
1201000	1204000	And it actually kind of made me go, well, shit, I can't quit now.
1204000	1207000	So I, like, kind of pushed myself to go for at least 10 more minutes.
1207000	1211000	And then I think I was able to take, like, a good 30 or 40 whoever was left
1211000	1213000	and then I passed them to Flaco when I was done for the night.
1213000	1216000	So it was kind of, you know, a nice little share the viewers
1216000	1218000	and pass them off to your friends.
1218000	1221000	They are talking about doing rooms,
1221000	1224000	which is something about separate spaces within your chat.
1224000	1227000	That's probably going to be better for people that have a larger audience than I do.
1227000	1234000	Rituals, which, like, is, like, say somebody is coming to your channel for the first time,
1234000	1237000	you can actually, like, if you signal that this person is new,
1237000	1241000	then there's, like, I don't know, like, a ritual where Twitch will break the ice in chat.
1241000	1244000	I kind of want to hear more about what that all is.
1244000	1247000	Something else I think is very interesting, achievements.
1247000	1250000	So they're going to actually put an achievement system within Twitch.
1250000	1254000	But unlike, you know, Xbox or PlayStation where, you know,
1254000	1256000	we add them up and the points don't matter type of thing,
1256000	1260000	these achievements are showing you have you unlocked affiliate status yet
1260000	1262000	or have you unlocked partner status.
1262000	1266000	That's kind of a neat way to do that, so kind of cute.
1266000	1270000	And then also gifting subscriptions because why not?
1270000	1274000	That means more money for said affiliates and partners, easier way to do that
1274000	1279000	and more ability to, you know, pass along a little coin to some of your favorite Twitch people.
1279000	1281000	So that's all the stuff they announced there.
1281000	1285000	And I know I'm focusing on Twitch and I'm not really saying as much about YouTube and Mixer
1285000	1289000	because, well, Twitch had the con, the other two didn't.
1289000	1294000	But where one company tends to go, others seem to follow.
1294000	1297000	Let me open it up here in studio and just kind of ask, you know,
1297000	1299000	what do you guys think about Twitch and where it's going
1299000	1303000	and some of this stuff we're hearing, having heard from the con?
1303000	1304000	Logie?
1304000	1308000	I don't know. I mean, I don't know why I would go to this.
1308000	1313000	I mean, other than I guess if I was really big fans of like some of the streamers or maybe.
1313000	1316000	I mean, I'm not really sure what this is even.
1316000	1321000	I think for me when I, you know, I was exactly like you that first year I went
1321000	1325000	when Jason was like, dude, I have an extra ticket and it's a two hour drive, you're coming.
1325000	1327000	And I was like, okay, yes, I'm going.
1327000	1331000	And when I went, I was like, oh, maybe if I thought of this more as a trade show,
1331000	1334000	I probably would have got it because when I got there, it was like, oh,
1334000	1336000	I'm actually seeing new streaming technology.
1336000	1340000	And oh, like here's a video card for sale that I actually bought at TwitchCon
1340000	1342000	that I actually use to stream on Twitch now.
1342000	1346000	And then, you know, I saw some new stuff that was going to go to Kickstarter,
1346000	1349000	but like ways to like, I think it was like a remote control,
1349000	1351000	like switch camera angles from like an iPad or something.
1351000	1354000	I don't remember what it was, but like, you know, it was kind of like,
1354000	1357000	and like John said on the call, you meet different charities
1357000	1359000	because more and more charities are embracing streaming.
1359000	1362000	I think we all know about Extra Life and Extra Life does a very good job
1362000	1364000	putting their name out there and so forth,
1364000	1368000	but other charities are seeing what Extra Life is doing and going,
1368000	1371000	hey, we want people to fundraise for us too, you know,
1371000	1374000	and people can kind of go find those causes that really speak to them.
1374000	1377000	So I think that's kind of what you also get out of it
1377000	1381000	is you get a lot of ideas for how to make your stream better.
1381000	1384000	And it's like-minded individuals who are doing the same thing.
1384000	1385000	I guess.
1385000	1386000	Yeah.
1386000	1388000	Well, I think it's interesting.
1389000	1390000	Let's see.
1390000	1395000	SSJ100Matt suggests that the ritual is Rocky Horror style hazing
1395000	1397000	in Twitch for first timers.
1397000	1398000	I like that idea.
1398000	1402000	Can I draw a V on someone in lipstick who comes into my chat
1402000	1403000	for the first time?
1403000	1404000	That'd be fantastic.
1404000	1405000	I love it.
1405000	1409000	Dark Soccer, are you going to have a ritual for your Twitch channel?
1410000	1412000	You must accept Garris as your savior.
1413000	1416000	Be like, why aren't you bitches saying anything?
1416000	1419000	I can't chat at you if you don't give me anything to chat with.
1420000	1421000	Love it.
1421000	1422000	All right.
1422000	1425000	So thanks again, John, for coming on the show and talking about TwitchCon
1425000	1429000	and congrats on Twitch for a successful, what is this, third year, fourth year?
1429000	1430000	I think I lost count.
1430000	1431000	I think it's the third year at TwitchCon.
1431000	1432000	So, yeah.
1432000	1433000	All right.
1433000	1434000	Awesome.
1434000	1436000	Well, we're going to get into our gaming weeks.
1436000	1439000	Actually, I will humor the chat with a question here
1439000	1442000	because we do tape live again at the Voice Geeks Network
1442000	1444000	every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern,
1444000	1447000	right after The Bobby Black Wolf Show.
1447000	1452000	And you can ask us questions in chat just like William 2DS XL Face is asking,
1452000	1454000	saying, Rob, Jamie, and Loki,
1454000	1458000	what do you think of the recent acquisition of Humble by IGN?
1458000	1461000	So we got into this a little bit last week.
1461000	1463000	I think Jamie brought the story.
1463000	1464000	I saw there was a follow-up.
1464000	1468000	I didn't put it on the list for tonight just because there was a bunch of other stories.
1468000	1469000	But let me check in.
1469000	1475000	How are you guys feeling one week later about the Humble and IGN acquisition?
1475000	1476000	Indifferent?
1476000	1477000	I mean, I don't know.
1477000	1479000	I don't like IGN.
1479000	1481000	I think they're dirty.
1481000	1486000	But I don't even know who they're owned by anymore because I don't know.
1486000	1490000	So really, I'm not worried about it until I need to be worried about it.
1490000	1492000	Jamie, your thoughts?
1492000	1496000	I don't have any reason to be worried yet.
1496000	1498000	So we just have to wait and see what happens.
1498000	1501000	I mean, it's so soon we don't know what they're going to do.
1501000	1502000	Right.
1502000	1503000	I'm waiting.
1503000	1507000	I'm cautiously optimistic to see what the changes are going to be.
1507000	1511000	And I'm cautiously optimistic maybe there will be no changes,
1511000	1516000	save for banner advertising for IGN at the top and bottom,
1516000	1520000	or maybe the links to the different games instead of going to YouTube.
1520000	1523000	There are going to be IGN videos about the games.
1523000	1525000	Those types of things I expect.
1525000	1530000	And at the end of the day, if I can still get games,
1530000	1534000	great games for a great value and decide where my money goes
1534000	1539000	and know that the vast majority of that money will go to the charity
1539000	1542000	and the developers, which is usually how I tend to split my money,
1542000	1543000	then I'll be fine with it.
1543000	1548000	But as I don't want IGN to try to make money off of this site,
1548000	1551000	that would be where I would kind of draw the line.
1551000	1555000	But I do expect that IGN will integrate their own resources
1555000	1557000	where it's appropriate to do so.
1557000	1559000	And I think y'all need to be ready for that.
1559000	1565000	So like I said, instead of YouTube's or instead of these high-rated games,
1565000	1572000	it's going to be an click here on IGN to read our 7.6 too much water out of 10 review.
1572000	1578000	The only thing, and this is such a minor thing that I would be kind of wary on,
1578000	1584000	is Humble is technically a publisher of independent games.
1584000	1588000	So they do have some games, like A Hat in Time, that they actually do publish.
1588000	1590000	These games are going to be reviewed by IGN,
1590000	1594000	and it's kind of hard to see that as not biased in a way.
1594000	1598000	I mean, that's the only thing, but that's such a minor thing.
1598000	1601000	It's like I don't even really think about it, but I don't know.
1601000	1603000	I just don't like them.
1603000	1604000	I mean, I'm sorry.
1604000	1608000	That's like saying if Fox News bought Humble Bundle or something like that,
1608000	1611000	it's like, eh, I just feel dirty.
1611000	1614000	I mean, that's kind of how I feel with IGN.
1614000	1617000	IGN, it's not even I don't like them.
1617000	1619000	I don't even think about them anymore.
1619000	1620000	Honestly, I don't visit their site anymore.
1620000	1622000	I used to visit it all the time.
1622000	1625000	You can't spell ignore without I-G-N-N.
1625000	1627000	I just, I don't know.
1627000	1629000	It's just not...
1629000	1632000	We're ignorant.
1632000	1635000	There are sites, though, that we've hated on
1635000	1639000	and that eventually come back to being fine again, like Kotaku.
1639000	1640000	Kotaku, sure.
1640000	1641000	Perfect example.
1641000	1642000	So who knows?
1642000	1645000	I mean, right now, like I said, until there's some major changes that...
1645000	1648000	The people at, I mean, not to get too shady,
1648000	1651000	but since y'all got me started, we're just amongst friends, right?
1651000	1654000	Since Kotaku, all the people that were a problem there
1654000	1656000	went and started a new website.
1656000	1661000	So what was left was people that made a pretty decent website.
1662000	1666000	So like, right now, I don't have to worry about it.
1666000	1668000	And they're not the only site that sells bundles.
1668000	1671000	There's like at least a few sites that do that.
1671000	1673000	So I'm not really worried.
1673000	1675000	And honestly, a lot of the bundles that they have nowadays,
1675000	1676000	I own most of the stuff in them.
1676000	1678000	So it's not something that I'm really looking at.
1678000	1682000	I do hope that they do more console bundles because those I do like.
1682000	1685000	Do you think maybe on that side,
1685000	1687000	and Jamie, I want to check on your thoughts, too,
1687000	1688000	but let me just do one question.
1689000	1691000	Do you think maybe the flip side of IGN's weight or something
1691000	1694000	is that maybe they'll have more leverage to do more 3DS?
1694000	1696000	They probably have more experienced marketing teams
1696000	1700000	that can sell that idea to some of these publishers.
1700000	1702000	That makes sense to me.
1702000	1703000	What about your thoughts, Jamie?
1706000	1707000	Honestly, I just agree with that.
1707000	1708000	I mean, it's what I just said.
1708000	1710000	That sounds like what they're doing.
1710000	1711000	Yeah.
1711000	1712000	Fair enough.
1712000	1714000	Like I said, until we have something to worry about,
1714000	1715000	I'm not going to worry about it.
1715000	1716000	All right.
1716000	1717000	There you go.
1717000	1720000	Answer your question live on chat over at live.vog.
1720000	1721000	Que sera, sera.
1721000	1722000	That's right.
1722000	1723000	Let's talk about our gaming weeks
1723000	1726000	and the types of video games that you have been playing this week.
1726000	1727000	Ladies first, Dark Soccer.
1727000	1728000	How was your gaming week?
1730000	1734000	We were wrapping up the convention guide, which is funny.
1734000	1737000	I have another edit to do when I get home, but that's okay.
1737000	1739000	So really not a whole lot.
1739000	1741000	I've been playing idle pouring.
1741000	1744000	I haven't really touched RO because, like I said,
1744000	1746000	my time has been taken up by the con guide.
1748000	1749000	You know, Pokemon Go.
1749000	1751000	I'm using that for my walking.
1754000	1755000	Miitomo a little bit.
1755000	1756000	Does that count as a game?
1758000	1759000	Ish.
1759000	1761000	Miitomo Drop is a game, I guess.
1761000	1762000	Yeah, that's true.
1762000	1765000	So I've been fairly good at that.
1765000	1767000	I actually like the costumes that they have out right now.
1767000	1770000	They have like the Nintendo Gakuen outfit.
1770000	1773000	So like cute little school uniforms.
1774000	1776000	So Miitomo is still being regularly updated.
1776000	1777000	Yeah.
1777000	1778000	Oh yeah.
1778000	1780000	To be fair, I'm not trying to be mean,
1780000	1784000	but I kind of forget Miitomo is a thing until you bring it up on the show.
1784000	1785000	That's my honest answer.
1785000	1787000	I kind of forget it's a thing and then you bring it up.
1787000	1789000	I'm like, oh yeah, I should like load that.
1792000	1794000	I actually went back and started playing,
1794000	1797000	trying to get through R-Type again on my iPhone.
1797000	1799000	It's just really difficult on there.
1799000	1801000	I mean, the version of R-Type is really good.
1801000	1805000	So I've been sort of digging around for other Irem games,
1805000	1810000	just to, I guess, kind of branch out from R-Type,
1810000	1813000	because really R-Type is the biggest Irem game I did much playing on.
1813000	1816000	So that's about it.
1816000	1817000	All right.
1817000	1819000	Let me head over to Loki and check in.
1819000	1820000	How was your gaming week?
1820000	1823000	Just more of the office space idle clicker game.
1823000	1826000	I actually have been playing a little bit of Pokemon Go
1826000	1829000	because they have that new event that's going on.
1829000	1833000	So I need more Ghost-type Pokemon, so I figured I'd do that.
1835000	1837000	Didn't play too much in the console games.
1837000	1840000	Just too lazy to actually set up my PlayStation to do PlayStation VR.
1840000	1842000	I did buy more PlayStation VR games,
1842000	1845000	so I have literally a plethora of games to play.
1845000	1848000	So one of them was, what was it called?
1848000	1851000	It's Megaton Rainfall, which is kind of like,
1851000	1854000	it's like an arcade shooter game.
1854000	1856000	I'm not sure about the controls on it,
1856000	1858000	but maybe they'll patch the Move controller into it.
1858000	1864000	But it's basically, imagine like Superman crossed with Earth Defense Force.
1864000	1868000	So you're flying around at like really fast speed and stuff like that
1868000	1872000	in and out of the atmosphere and destroying aliens with like heat vision and stuff.
1872000	1875000	And you can blow up buildings and they just crumble down to the ground.
1875000	1877000	It's my type of game.
1877000	1880000	So I'm definitely wanting to check that out.
1880000	1884000	So I'll try this week to actually get to those games
1884000	1886000	because I've just been meaning to do that.
1886000	1889000	But the problem is my wife's been watching The Office on TV,
1889000	1893000	and so like any games that require me to stand up and use the Move controllers and stuff
1893000	1898000	might make it hard to watch TV because, you know, it's in the same room.
1898000	1902000	Even though I don't need the TV because I have the headset, it's just, you know.
1903000	1905000	She just needs to read books.
1905000	1908000	I got her books for a reason, to read them.
1908000	1910000	She does at the gym though.
1910000	1912000	But we're almost out of office.
1912000	1914000	We're almost out of office because we're on the final season again.
1914000	1917000	But she does this where she'll occasionally just jump into a random episode
1917000	1919000	and just finish the whole series.
1920000	1922000	Which is fine because this show's hilarious.
1922000	1923000	It is funny.
1923000	1924000	All right, anything else?
1924000	1925000	That's it.
1925000	1926000	All right.
1927000	1932000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,
1932000	1934000	use the passphrase, beam.
1934000	1936000	My gaming week. I'm not going to lie.
1936000	1940000	I had a really rough week personally and I kind of told you a little bit about that earlier
1940000	1942000	and there's other stuff going on.
1942000	1944000	I haven't really played a lot of video games.
1944000	1948000	In fact, even that Big Brother game I was talking to you guys about that I was playing,
1948000	1950000	I ended up quitting it.
1950000	1952000	And that was not an easy thing to do.
1952000	1957000	But let me put it this way, even though most people are going to totally misunderstand this reference.
1957000	1959000	But Jamie will understand this reference.
1959000	1961000	I know JD will understand this reference.
1961000	1964000	It was kind of like a door in All-Stars 2.
1964000	1967000	I completely understand why a door left All-Stars 2 now
1967000	1969000	because it was a very similar thing that caused me to kind of...
1969000	1972000	the psychological intensity of that game,
1972000	1975000	I could not handle it with everything else that was going on.
1975000	1978000	So they were very nice about it and they were like,
1978000	1980000	oh, you'll have an open invite to come back when we want,
1980000	1982000	which I thought was very, very nice and classy and all that.
1982000	1985000	And I was a little disappointed that I couldn't kind of stick with it.
1985000	1988000	But you guys, it has not been a good week.
1988000	1991000	So I just thought I'd give you that update.
1991000	1994000	As far as video games go, though, I did play some stuff.
1994000	1996000	Just not a lot of new stuff.
1997000	2000000	I played a lot of Pokemon Go, actually.
2000000	2002000	I've been playing a lot of that.
2002000	2004000	The Halloween event's been a nice motivator,
2004000	2006000	but I've also just kind of gotten in this routine
2006000	2010000	where I will nuke lunch at my desk and kind of have that ready to go.
2010000	2013000	And then I go on a big 30-minute walk
2013000	2016000	and I use my little Pokemon Go clicker to catch Mons
2016000	2018000	and then I'm walking too.
2018000	2019000	So it's a nice little...
2019000	2024000	My route is 2K, so I can hatch a 2K egg easy.
2024000	2025000	It's just a little over 2K.
2025000	2027000	So I can hatch a 2K egg easy on my route.
2027000	2030000	So that's kind of one thing I've been doing.
2030000	2033000	And then I've also been playing a little bit of Heroes of the Storm this week
2033000	2037000	because I've been trying to do my daily quest to save some gold
2037000	2040000	so I can buy Junkrat, who has just released into the game.
2040000	2042000	So Heroes of the Storm has been kind of fun.
2042000	2044000	I pretty much only play the AI stuff, though.
2044000	2050000	I don't know if I can handle some of the real people matches right now,
2050000	2051000	which I don't know.
2051000	2052000	I can handle it in Overwatch,
2052000	2054000	but people can get really nasty on their keyboards
2054000	2056000	in games like Heroes of the Storm.
2056000	2058000	But I'll probably try to dip my toe in
2058000	2061000	and play some more actual PvP in those games soon.
2061000	2064000	One other kind of random thing I'll mention that I played this week,
2064000	2067000	probably because I was playing so much Pokemon Go
2067000	2070000	and I've been collecting so much like Gen 1 and 2
2070000	2073000	and now even a little bit of 3 stuff,
2073000	2075000	I was like, you know what?
2075000	2079000	I'm going to download Pokemon Silver because that's on Virtual Console
2079000	2084000	and I really never played a lot of that before.
2084000	2090000	I think I might have played a little bit on an emulator years ago,
2090000	2093000	but I haven't really played that game.
2093000	2098000	I didn't know if I would respond well to playing an old Pokemon game,
2098000	2102000	but I downloaded it and I paid the 10 bucks or whatever it is on 3DS.
2102000	2106000	I downloaded it and I've played an hour or two,
2106000	2109000	enough to where I'm about to take on the first gym,
2109000	2113000	so enough to dip my toe in, and I'm having enough fun with it.
2113000	2116000	The only weird thing is with there not being an XP share,
2116000	2119000	that's the really annoying part of the old Pokemon games.
2119000	2123000	You have to have a Pokemon go in, pull it out,
2123000	2126000	and then send the real one in so you can share the XP
2126000	2128000	and get a little bit on that first Pokemon.
2128000	2130000	That's how you level them up.
2130000	2134000	Yes, and as William2DxSLface in our chat points out,
2134000	2140000	the Virtual Console Silver can transfer Pokemon one way to the Pokemon Bank.
2140000	2142000	Yeah, and that was a big motivator too,
2142000	2145000	because if I do get Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon,
2145000	2150000	which I don't know if I will because I didn't really finish Pokemon Moon,
2150000	2153000	and I can't really explain the why in that.
2153000	2155000	I think that's just my whole ADD.
2155000	2158000	I think Pokemon always gets to a point for me where it's like,
2158000	2160000	there's too much.
2160000	2162000	There's like Pokemon Fashion Show,
2162000	2165000	there's Pokemon Berry Growing, there's Pokemon,
2165000	2168000	and my brain says you have to do it all,
2168000	2170000	even though you really don't have to do that,
2170000	2172000	and I think that's where I always struggle in Pokemon games.
2172000	2175000	So will my playthrough of Pokemon Silver be any different?
2175000	2179000	I don't know. We'll see, but so far, so good.
2179000	2181000	Anyway, that was my gaming week.
2181000	2183000	So how about you, JD? How was your gaming week?
2183000	2185000	What types of games have you played?
2185000	2188000	I've been playing a lot of Splatoon, especially after the Splatfest,
2188000	2190000	which I know was two weeks ago.
2190000	2193000	I got up to the king rank in the Splatfest,
2193000	2195000	which is the top line,
2195000	2197000	and I've been playing ranked a lot more than Turf War,
2197000	2199000	and I finally made it to the league,
2199000	2201000	which you have to get to...
2201000	2203000	Oh, I'm so sorry, JD. They can't hear you.
2203000	2205000	That's why I'm ripping it away.
2205000	2207000	You have to put the mic right up against your mouth.
2207000	2209000	Okay.
2209000	2212000	Other than Splatoon, which I've really been putting a lot of time in,
2212000	2214000	Coming Out on Top, which is a gay dating game,
2214000	2216000	came out on Steam this week.
2216000	2220000	So even though it's four years old at this point,
2220000	2223000	I played through it to get all the achievements,
2223000	2225000	and they also put new art in.
2225000	2227000	So that's been fun.
2227000	2229000	I've been playing Konga Master Party,
2229000	2231000	which is a...
2231000	2234000	It's not a rhythm game.
2234000	2236000	It's kind of a variation on Snake,
2236000	2239000	where you walk around a bunch of people,
2239000	2242000	and you try to convince them to join your Konga line,
2242000	2244000	and then things happen.
2244000	2247000	It's a lot of fun, and it has a cool multiplayer mode.
2247000	2251000	P-Cross on Switch has also been a good, relaxing game.
2251000	2254000	And I signed up for Twitch a little while ago
2254000	2257000	just to stream Cook, Serve, Delicious 2,
2257000	2259000	which also came out in the past month.
2259000	2262000	And that's been an interesting change,
2262000	2264000	and I haven't gotten very many viewers,
2264000	2266000	but it's a fun experience.
2268000	2271000	Well, you should probably plug your channel so we can follow you.
2271000	2277000	Yeah, my username is JD, which is J-A-I underscore D-I-T.
2278000	2282000	I have a buddy on Twitch who streams a lot of that Cook, Serve, Delicious 2,
2282000	2284000	and it looks like it's kind of a fun game.
2284000	2286000	It looks like it's a little bit chaotic.
2286000	2288000	It looks almost like a typing tutor game, though,
2288000	2290000	because you're just typing so fast.
2290000	2294000	So my nickname for the game is Mavis Bacon Teaches Typing,
2294000	2296000	because it really is a typing game.
2296000	2300000	You can play with a controller or a mouse, but you shouldn't.
2300000	2302000	It's like clicking your skills in an MMO.
2302000	2305000	It makes the most sense to really do it with a keyboard,
2305000	2307000	because there are just so many different things,
2307000	2310000	and a lot of it just comes ultimately down to muscle memory.
2310000	2312000	There's a lot of different recipes,
2312000	2314000	and you have to prepare them on the fly.
2314000	2318000	Somebody will say, well, I want nachos done with these toppings,
2318000	2321000	and then the next order might come in and it'll be completely different,
2321000	2325000	and you have to find the right keys on three different screens of it.
2325000	2327000	So having a keyboard really helps.
2328000	2331000	But yeah, it's a lot of just remembering how it works,
2331000	2335000	but typing is the gist of the gameplay.
2337000	2339000	For the record, I click on skills in Final Fantasy XIV.
2339000	2341000	Some of them, some of them.
2341000	2343000	I use my keyboard for some.
2343000	2347000	Usually when I'm healing, I use my keyboard for the cures,
2347000	2350000	and I use the clicking for the stuff that's off cycle,
2350000	2353000	which I know is kind of weird, but that's just how I do it, okay?
2354000	2357000	I mean, my guilty secret is that I do the same thing in Guild Wars 2.
2357000	2359000	I'm really lazy about it,
2359000	2362000	because I also don't have a mouse with 19 buttons on it,
2362000	2365000	so I'm just using a regular keyboard for the most part.
2366000	2370000	Dartetsuya in chat suggests that it sounds like an OLR dream game.
2370000	2373000	Loki presents Mavis Bacon teaches typing,
2373000	2376000	so maybe that's something that can happen in the future.
2376000	2380000	I did see that the wonderful channel Epic Meal Time,
2380000	2385000	where they had a recipe for pizza bacon, which looks amazing.
2385000	2390000	It's basically bacon with cheese and pepperoni on it.
2390000	2392000	Nice. All right.
2392000	2395000	Well, thank you, JD, for sharing your gaming week with us.
2395000	2399000	We're going to get to a little bit of housekeeping.
2399000	2402000	Follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.
2402000	2405000	We're also on Facebook at Orange Lounge Radio on Facebook,
2405000	2409000	and as a reminder, we will not be here November 12th.
2409000	2413000	It's Veterans Day weekend. I am taking a vacation.
2413000	2415000	Why? Because I deserve it.
2415000	2419000	I'm taking a vacation, and I won't be here because I'll be in Seattle.
2419000	2422000	If you happen to live in that area,
2422000	2426000	because we went a couple years ago,
2426000	2430000	so we've done the Space Needle, we've done the EMP,
2430000	2431000	all that stuff is cool.
2431000	2434000	We've done Pike's Market, which we're going to do that again
2434000	2435000	because we love the market,
2435000	2438000	but if you have suggestions for what else we should do there
2438000	2442000	that's not all the uber touristy stuff, I'm open for ideas.
2442000	2446000	Hit me up on Twitter at Skye, S-K-I-E, especially gamer stuff.
2446000	2447000	I think it would be really cool.
2447000	2450000	Like arcades I should be checking out
2450000	2453000	that isn't the one across the street from the convention center
2453000	2455000	because I've been there a million times.
2455000	2457000	Places like that. That would be awesome.
2457000	2461000	Anyway, let's now get into some gaming news.
2461000	2463000	Loki's starting us off tonight.
2463000	2466000	All right. Well, there's lots to talk about Nintendo,
2466000	2471000	and of course all this has to do with the recent 4.0 firmware update.
2471000	2473000	So lots of features being added to it,
2473000	2477000	including things that really a lot of other systems have had for a while,
2477000	2478000	but it's nice to see them here.
2478000	2481000	So one thing that they added was video capture,
2481000	2484000	and it's kind of limited at the moment.
2484000	2486000	It only works on certain games.
2486000	2490000	So like, for example, Breath of the Wild, Mario Kart 8,
2490000	2492000	Arms, and Splatoon 2.
2492000	2498000	And they haven't really said if it's going to be added with other games,
2498000	2501000	but so far those are the four.
2501000	2508000	And with that, of course, you can upload the clips to Facebook or Twitter,
2508000	2511000	and it captures the last 30 seconds.
2511000	2513000	So it's something, I guess.
2513000	2518000	And then, of course, you can also transfer your profiles and saves to another Switch.
2518000	2521000	So I guess if you run into an issue where your Switch dies
2521000	2525000	or if you just need to move it over or something like that, you can do that.
2525000	2527000	So that's kind of cool.
2527000	2533000	And then along with that, of course, they've added support as well for some USB headsets.
2533000	2537000	Once again, though, it's not exactly everything.
2537000	2542000	So basically you can use USB headsets.
2542000	2546000	They need to be plugged into a dock where it's recognized by the Switch,
2546000	2553000	and I guess you can also do USB speakers that way as well.
2553000	2556000	And yeah, I don't know.
2556000	2558000	It sounds kind of limited there.
2558000	2565000	So based on that, you're not going to be able to use it for voice chat, though, apparently.
2567000	2570000	Well, how convenient.
2570000	2572000	Yeah.
2573000	2577000	But then along with that, though, despite all those limitations,
2577000	2579000	the Switch, of course, is still doing very well.
2579000	2586000	They've sold 2 million units in the US and worldwide 4.7 units.
2586000	2588000	Total failure.
2588000	2590000	Well, just kidding.
2590000	2594000	There's a lot of things that they really should have in there that they don't have in there,
2594000	2598000	like where the fuck is Virtual Console or whatever the fuck is going to replace it.
2598000	2600000	Well, not everything can be the 3DO.
2600000	2605000	Well, but based on what you just said, Loki, does it matter?
2605000	2608000	I mean, it's selling pretty well.
2608000	2612000	And even though most of us hardcore gamers are sitting here going,
2612000	2614000	but what about X?
2614000	2616000	And your voice chat is garbage.
2616000	2618000	Like, does it matter?
2618000	2620000	Because it's still selling.
2620000	2625000	So clearly Nintendo does literally whatever the fuck they want,
2625000	2629000	and they can do it because they're Nintendo.
2629000	2631000	And it doesn't matter.
2631000	2633000	Nothing matters.
2634000	2636000	Yeah.
2636000	2638000	I don't know.
2638000	2643000	It's funny seeing the Switch and how it operates with things
2643000	2646000	and then also looking at different emulators like the CMU
2646000	2654000	that basically can port out a better-looking version of Zelda Breath of the Wild
2654000	2658000	with all these enhanced features that the Switch can't possibly do.
2658000	2660000	And it's like, holy shit.
2660000	2663000	Imagine if there's just more power in this, what you can do.
2663000	2666000	But then again, when we're talking about Nintendo,
2666000	2668000	and they'll just do things their way, and they're like,
2668000	2671000	well, we sold some, so obviously it's doing well,
2671000	2673000	and we're not going to change anything.
2673000	2677000	We're going to be, what was the word, brave?
2677000	2683000	What's Apple's term for, like, we're going to remove those headphone ports
2683000	2685000	because we're adventurous.
2685000	2686000	I believe it was brave.
2686000	2687000	Courage.
2688000	2690000	I don't know what it was.
2690000	2692000	It was courage.
2692000	2693000	They took a lot of crap for that.
2693000	2695000	They're courageous, yes.
2695000	2697000	It's just Nintendo being courageous.
2697000	2700000	But to be fair in that whole thing,
2700000	2704000	didn't their most recent Android phone just make the same change?
2704000	2708000	And now people are like, oh, okay, whatever.
2708000	2711000	So I'm just saying, just saying.
2711000	2712000	All right, anyway.
2712000	2714000	That's called being a hypocrite.
2714000	2716000	But it made wood change?
2716000	2721000	They got rid, the Pixel 2 or whatever got rid of that headphone jack.
2721000	2723000	And it's the same thing now where you have to use a converter
2723000	2724000	to have a headphone jack.
2724000	2726000	Oh, that's a Pixel. No one wants those.
2726000	2728000	All right.
2728000	2731000	See, that's one of those phones that they're like, hey, look it,
2731000	2733000	we're like Apple 2.
2733000	2735000	Getting away from phones and back to Nintendo.
2735000	2738000	What do you think about the whole video recording thing, though?
2738000	2739000	I haven't used it yet.
2739000	2743000	It sounds all right, but it's like 30 seconds, really?
2743000	2745000	I mean, I guess that's all the system can handle,
2745000	2746000	but...
2746000	2750000	Well, I believe actdeft in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com
2750000	2753000	said something to the effect of Nintendo said they were going to make it
2753000	2756000	so they can record more than 30 seconds in the future.
2756000	2757000	So it's 30 seconds now.
2757000	2758000	Then why can't they do it now?
2758000	2760000	Why is it only 30 seconds now?
2760000	2763000	Because Nintendo's going to do whatever they want.
2763000	2766000	And they're like, we have to figure out how this Internet thing works.
2766000	2768000	It's Nintendo's world.
2768000	2769000	We're just living in it.
2769000	2771000	And it doesn't matter whatever Nintendo does.
2771000	2773000	They're never going to make you happy, Loki.
2773000	2775000	They are going to make me happy.
2775000	2778000	They would just be competent at what they're doing.
2778000	2780000	And don't get me wrong.
2780000	2784000	See, they suffer from what the thing that Apple suffers is,
2784000	2787000	that people are basically evangelists for these products
2787000	2790000	and they can release a pile of shit with Nintendo's name on it
2790000	2791000	and they will buy it.
2791000	2794000	I mean, call me crazy,
2794000	2797000	but is there maybe a reason why people get enthusiastic,
2797000	2801000	especially when we're talking about games like Breath of the Wild,
2801000	2803000	Splatoon 2?
2803000	2806000	I mean, these games are pretty fucking rad.
2806000	2811000	And Mario Odyssey is going to be good.
2811000	2813000	It's just an accepted fact.
2813000	2814000	It's going to be a good game.
2814000	2815000	We know it's going to be a good game.
2815000	2820000	Has Nintendo made a bad mainline Mario game?
2820000	2824000	Some may say Mario Sunshine, to which I say have a seat.
2824000	2826000	Mario Sunshine was great.
2826000	2828000	We did have Mario was missing.
2828000	2830000	But that wasn't a mainline Mario game.
2830000	2834000	That was a mistake of licensing Mario to some other developer
2834000	2836000	to make potty garbage.
2836000	2838000	Although, the one thing that game proved to me
2838000	2843000	was that it could actually run on early Super Nintendo level graphics
2843000	2847000	because it had some of the same dungeon music and scenery.
2847000	2848000	Well, that's right.
2848000	2849000	And it was even on the NES, wasn't it?
2849000	2850000	I thought the game was on the Super Nintendo.
2850000	2851000	It was on the NES.
2851000	2854000	It might have been one of those rare games that was on both, too.
2854000	2855000	So, anyway.
2855000	2857000	I mean, it's fine.
2857000	2862000	I guess we don't need headset support for your games,
2862000	2864000	and we don't need three-court clips.
2864000	2867000	Well, Loki, you don't right now.
2867000	2868000	What is everybody doing?
2868000	2872000	Any Switch owner I know right now is like, Discord, Skype, whatever.
2872000	2874000	We work around it.
2874000	2877000	We don't need Nintendo to do it because we figured it out another way.
2877000	2878000	Well, exactly.
2878000	2880000	Why should they put the effort in if everyone's going to put the effort for them
2880000	2882000	and then praise them for it?
2882000	2884000	So, then are we all in agreement?
2884000	2885000	Fuck it.
2885000	2886000	Nintendo voice chat?
2886000	2887000	Fuck it.
2887000	2888000	We've all just...
2888000	2889000	They're not going to do it.
2889000	2891000	They have not been able to rise.
2891000	2893000	We've all figured out a way around it now.
2893000	2894000	Fuck it.
2894000	2896000	Nintendo could just move those resources somewhere else.
2896000	2899000	This has gone on without Nintendo.
2899000	2901000	Whatever you guys want to do.
2901000	2903000	As long as you're happy.
2903000	2906000	As long as you're happy with them.
2906000	2907000	Fucking just sitting there going...
2907000	2908000	Whatever sinks your battleship.
2908000	2909000	Well, you know what?
2909000	2911000	We could develop this feature, but fuck it.
2911000	2914000	We'll just let them go ahead and just do it for us,
2914000	2916000	and then we're just going to sit back and relax.
2916000	2920000	Loki just sounds like that whole group sitting around going,
2920000	2921000	where do you want to go to dinner?
2921000	2922000	I don't know.
2922000	2923000	Where do you want to go to dinner?
2923000	2924000	I don't know where you want to go to dinner.
2924000	2926000	Well, somebody just made a goddamn decision.
2926000	2928000	All right, we're going to go to Applebee's.
2928000	2930000	That would be more the equivalent.
2930000	2932000	Okay, we'll just make dinner.
2932000	2934000	And Loki, whatever you want to do.
2934000	2936000	Applebee's, really?
2936000	2938000	All right, fine.
2938000	2940000	Whatever you want to do.
2940000	2941000	I'm over it.
2941000	2942000	Fine.
2943000	2945000	Sometimes it's just easier to agree
2945000	2948000	and let the argument end, to try to even bother.
2948000	2950000	Because at this point, you're just having an ill...
2950000	2953000	You're trying to argue logic with Nintendo,
2953000	2954000	and there just isn't any.
2954000	2958000	But they sold two million Switches, so...
2960000	2962000	I know. I know.
2962000	2966000	It's not that I disagree completely, Loki,
2966000	2968000	but it's one of those things...
2968000	2970000	I, too, really wish,
2970000	2972000	I think a lot of Nintendo fans really wish
2972000	2975000	we could figure out what the fuck is going on with Virtual Console,
2975000	2978000	and will I be able to take NES games on the go?
2978000	2981000	Or is Virtual Console going to be for GameCube games?
2981000	2983000	Or what the hell is Nintendo doing?
2983000	2985000	Because Nintendo does have a large back catalogue
2985000	2986000	I would like to be playing.
2986000	2988000	I think a lot of Nintendo fans are in that same boat.
2988000	2991000	So there are things I think even the most hardcore
2991000	2992000	Nintendo fans would agree with you on,
2992000	2993000	and those types of things.
2993000	2994000	They're just leaving money on the table.
2994000	2995000	That's what it is.
2995000	2996000	Yeah.
2996000	2998000	But at the same time,
2998000	3001000	Nintendo can just kind of do what they want,
3001000	3003000	and they sell two million, and it works.
3003000	3004000	So why not?
3004000	3006000	Well, I hope nothing else big comes out.
3006000	3008000	All right. Moving on.
3008000	3011000	Let's move on to talk about Gran Turismo Sport.
3011000	3014000	Hey, you want to talk about online mode being challenging?
3014000	3016000	Let's see what's happening on the PlayStation 4,
3016000	3018000	because here's the alternative, Loki.
3018000	3021000	Oh, I didn't even think what a great fucking follow-up
3021000	3024000	this was going to be, but here we go.
3024000	3029000	So Gran Turismo Sport came out this past week on Tuesday,
3029000	3031000	and guess what?
3031000	3034000	Because Gran Turismo Sport had the servers down
3034000	3036000	for a couple days,
3036000	3038000	you couldn't connect to the servers for a little bit.
3038000	3040000	I guess that was during the review cycle,
3040000	3043000	not after the game once came out, just to be fair.
3043000	3046000	But something that people were realizing is that
3046000	3049000	if you could not connect to the servers,
3049000	3053000	you couldn't play the game hardly at all.
3053000	3057000	Technically, you can play the game. Technically.
3057000	3059000	But you can't save your file.
3059000	3060000	Yes.
3060000	3062000	That's right. To save your fucking game,
3062000	3067000	you had to be online in order to save your game in arcade mode.
3067000	3070000	Yes, and I'm sure that plan will work out swingly.
3070000	3073000	I'm sure that that's not a terrible idea at all.
3073000	3075000	Why are they doing this?
3075000	3076000	Because it has to be.
3076000	3077000	Because they're assholes.
3077000	3079000	Well, they're not going to.
3079000	3081000	The official press release doesn't say,
3081000	3083000	we're doing this because we're assholes.
3083000	3085000	That's not how game companies spin.
3085000	3088000	Because they're courageous. We're so courageous.
3088000	3091000	The real reason is the link up between
3091000	3093000	Gran Turismo and the FIA,
3093000	3096000	which is an organization that runs motorsport around the world.
3096000	3100000	FIA Esports is an integral part of what they're trying to do
3100000	3102000	with Gran Theft Auto.
3102000	3103000	Gran Theft Turismo.
3103000	3105000	Gran Theft is a Gran Turismo sport.
3105000	3108000	So, saves being in the cloud,
3108000	3110000	that is meant to keep people from cheating,
3110000	3113000	so that they are not cheating within the game,
3113000	3114000	and all of that.
3114000	3119000	So, you can, I guess, thank cheaters for this being all online.
3120000	3122000	That is a load of horseshit.
3122000	3126000	It's like, if only we had the ability to create
3126000	3130000	a separate save profile for online and offline.
3130000	3132000	If only that were such a thing we could program,
3132000	3133000	but we just can't program it.
3133000	3138000	Now, so, Loki, keeping in mind that we just followed up
3138000	3141000	a story about Nintendo being a little bit behind.
3141000	3143000	Here we are, over on Sony's side,
3143000	3145000	and that's what this future looks like,
3145000	3147000	and it's kind of poopy caca.
3147000	3149000	Because at least to Nintendo's credit,
3149000	3152000	they've designed a system out of
3152000	3155000	pick up your game and take it out the building
3155000	3157000	where there's no Wi-Fi and you're good.
3157000	3160000	Like, you can play Skyrim wherever the fuck you want.
3160000	3161000	You don't need internet.
3161000	3163000	Single player? Not a problem.
3163000	3165000	It's online where we're challenged.
3166000	3168000	Exactly, you kind of have to have online
3168000	3170000	or they'll be able to have this online crap,
3170000	3172000	and they don't have online.
3172000	3177000	They have a tin can phone of online right now.
3177000	3180000	I mean, so, that's...
3180000	3181000	They have AOL dial-up.
3181000	3183000	And you know what?
3183000	3185000	If they grow as big as far as online goes,
3185000	3187000	you can bet that they're just dabbing
3187000	3189000	in this kind of bullshit, okay?
3189000	3190000	Don't get me...
3190000	3193000	We've got Animal Crossing still coming out.
3193000	3195000	Can't wait to see how that goes on mobile.
3195000	3199000	I mean, you know, just because
3199000	3202000	any company that does this sort of shit is dickish.
3202000	3203000	I mean, EA has done this.
3203000	3205000	Blizzard has done this kind of crap.
3205000	3207000	You know, with Diablo 3.
3207000	3210000	Yeah, I was gonna say, to be fair to, you know,
3210000	3212000	Sony and all that stuff,
3212000	3214000	it's not like games haven't had an
3214000	3215000	always online requirement before.
3215000	3217000	Any MMO is gonna require you to be online.
3217000	3218000	Any of them.
3218000	3220000	Like you said, Diablo 3.
3220000	3221000	And everybody thought,
3221000	3223000	oh, this is the end for Diablo.
3223000	3225000	Turns out it wasn't the always online part
3225000	3226000	that killed Diablo.
3226000	3228000	It was that auction house,
3228000	3230000	which is why it was always online.
3230000	3231000	But now the auction house is gone.
3231000	3232000	Diablo's kind of rad.
3232000	3233000	It's just, it's...
3233000	3235000	This excuse is dumb.
3235000	3238000	Because this reminds me exactly of SimCity with EA.
3238000	3239000	Because they said,
3239000	3244000	oh, I have to do all this online processing stuff in the cloud
3244000	3246000	because it's just not possible to push out these fucking
3246000	3249000	amazing physics and graphics.
3249000	3250000	That's a load of horseshit.
3250000	3251000	It was a load of horseshit.
3251000	3253000	And same reason for this.
3253000	3255000	Oh, we have to tie in this esports network.
3255000	3256000	What if I want to play offline
3256000	3260000	and I don't give a flying fuck about esports?
3260000	3261000	All right.
3261000	3263000	Quickly, before I go to your next story, Jamie,
3263000	3265000	anything you want to chime in on?
3265000	3267000	No, I want to do my story.
3267000	3268000	All right, fine.
3268000	3269000	Go ahead.
3269000	3273000	So they've put out the information on the amiibo
3273000	3276000	that will be coming out for Super Mario Odyssey.
3276000	3278000	Lots of interesting compatibility.
3278000	3281000	And one of the questions was about Peach's wedding dress.
3281000	3285000	Well, it works on Mario.
3285000	3288000	So I reckon if Link can run around in a Gerudo outfit,
3288000	3292000	then Mario can run around in a beautiful wedding dress.
3292000	3293000	Because you know what?
3293000	3296000	It's a good day for a white wedding.
3296000	3299000	But the image of Mario in a wedding dress is rad.
3299000	3300000	I love it.
3300000	3302000	And my favorite thing I saw on the entire internet
3302000	3307000	was a tweet that had that picture next to a still from Paris is Burning
3307000	3310000	that said Butch Queen first time at a ball.
3310000	3313000	I died.
3313000	3315000	So did they get the costumes from other people?
3315000	3317000	So could we do zero suit Samus with...
3317000	3323000	It would be cool, but I don't think this sleeveless is the right look for...
3323000	3326000	Sorry, strapless is the right look for Mario.
3326000	3328000	He's a little down on his hair grooming.
3328000	3330000	He's a little too bare for us.
3330000	3333000	It's real season two wedding realness.
3333000	3334000	Yeah, it is.
3335000	3337000	No, it's the...
3337000	3339000	Which season was it?
3339000	3341000	No, yeah, it was...
3341000	3344000	No, I'm talking about where the queens were dressing up,
3344000	3346000	the women's husbands or fiancés.
3346000	3348000	I think that was season six.
3348000	3350000	That was because it was Bianca.
3350000	3352000	That's what this is.
3352000	3357000	It's dressing up very, very, very hairy straight men.
3359000	3361000	No, I don't think it's the same as the half and half.
3361000	3363000	There was at least some waxing done.
3363000	3366000	Anyway, away from Drag Race talk for a minute here.
3366000	3370000	Well, I think it's cute.
3370000	3373000	It's not that serious.
3373000	3376000	A Mario game is not that serious,
3376000	3380000	and it's just one of those things where it's humorous.
3380000	3384000	You know there's going to be some bro dude who gets his mantis in a bunch.
3384000	3386000	And don't buy the amoeba.
3386000	3389000	Can he do peaches like float with this thing?
3389000	3390000	It'd be cool.
3390000	3392000	We don't know. That would be cool, though, if he could.
3393000	3399000	If a bro is that worried that Mario wearing a wedding dress in the game
3399000	3404000	is going to somehow impact this bro's sexuality or something,
3404000	3406000	then let me tell you, that bro has a lot of other problems
3406000	3408000	that have nothing to do with video games.
3408000	3415000	If something external is making you that uncomfortable with your own sexuality,
3415000	3418000	then maybe you were uncomfortable with it to begin with.
3418000	3420000	I have some confused feelings about Mario now.
3420000	3422000	It's such an awkward boner about it.
3425000	3428000	Anyway, there you go.
3428000	3430000	I'm excited for this game.
3430000	3433000	Not just that. I mean, I was already excited for Mario Odyssey.
3433000	3436000	But I think what kind of made me giggle about this
3436000	3442000	was that remember all the controversy about the sombrero wearing Mario
3442000	3447000	and people were like, how could you appropriate Mexican culture like that?
3447000	3450000	Whereas Act Deaf, who's here and lives in Mexico,
3450000	3452000	is like, actually, I think it's kind of funny.
3452000	3455000	And most people are not funny, but I think it's kind of rad.
3455000	3457000	And most people here think it's kind of adorable
3457000	3460000	and love to see ourselves represented like that and so forth.
3460000	3462000	I think this is just kind of one of those things
3462000	3464000	where it kind of just takes it a step further.
3464000	3469000	It's just like they're just silly costumes for fun that Mario...
3469000	3475000	It's like Halloween. People dress up as fun things.
3475000	3476000	It's not that serious.
3476000	3478000	Anyway.
3478000	3480000	Oh, I didn't realize Mariochi had a name.
3480000	3483000	Thank you, Act Deaf. That's a great name.
3483000	3484000	Mariochi.
3484000	3486000	All right.
3486000	3488000	Let's move on with another news story.
3488000	3489000	Loki.
3489000	3490000	All right.
3490000	3493000	So speaking of evil companies earlier,
3493000	3495000	Activision has decided...
3495000	3501000	Now, they've patented a technique that allows matchmaking
3501000	3505000	to influence players into buying microtransactions.
3505000	3507000	So how does this work?
3507000	3510000	Basically, in the matchmaking system,
3510000	3512000	you normally think that it would team you up with people
3512000	3515000	that are of equal skill level.
3515000	3518000	This actually would kind of fuck that whole system up
3518000	3521000	by teaming up against people that are slightly better than you,
3521000	3524000	and they would have certain unlockable gear
3524000	3526000	that you would want to buy.
3526000	3531000	And so with that, they kind of figure out which DLC
3531000	3534000	or loot boxes or whatever that you're interested in purchasing
3534000	3536000	and keep kind of taunting you with these players
3536000	3537000	that are better than you
3537000	3541000	and kind of trying to drive you into purchasing that stuff.
3541000	3544000	So basically, they've patented a way to break
3544000	3547000	the fucking matchmaking system at their own benefit.
3547000	3548000	But don't worry.
3548000	3551000	They haven't implemented any of their games yet.
3551000	3554000	They would fucking admit to that if that was a thing.
3554000	3556000	So I don't know.
3556000	3558000	But some of the examples they set in there...
3558000	3560000	For example, if a player purchased a particular weapon,
3560000	3563000	the microtransaction engine might match the player
3563000	3566000	in a gameplay session in which the particular weapon
3566000	3567000	is highly effective.
3567000	3568000	Yeah, right.
3568000	3570000	That's one of the ways that they're saying.
3570000	3573000	Or this might encourage players to make future purchases
3573000	3575000	to achieve similar gameplay results.
3575000	3578000	The matchmaking system would analyze player trends
3578000	3580000	such as latency and weapon preference
3580000	3582000	in order to place them in scenarios
3582000	3585000	that might lead them to buy certain items.
3585000	3587000	That's just sick.
3587000	3588000	It's sick.
3588000	3593000	And especially seeing how games like even Destiny
3593000	3596000	and just a lot of these games,
3596000	3598000	especially like this end of the year,
3598000	3599000	come out with like...
3599000	3601000	Didn't Bungie come out and say, though,
3601000	3602000	not in our game.
3602000	3603000	This is not here.
3603000	3605000	Stop. Get your tinfoil hats off.
3605000	3608000	They can say whatever the fuck they want.
3608000	3609000	Doesn't mean...
3609000	3613000	How are we going to prove if that's not the case?
3613000	3614000	How would we even prove that?
3614000	3615000	We can't prove that.
3615000	3617000	So they can say whatever the fuck they want.
3617000	3619000	I don't trust Activision.
3619000	3620000	I don't trust them.
3620000	3623000	Because this is a company that's taken stuff
3623000	3626000	that was a feature in a game,
3626000	3628000	the previous game, like Destiny,
3628000	3632000	like especially with the different shaders.
3632000	3635000	They've taken it and they've handicapped it now
3635000	3637000	and locked it behind loot boxes.
3637000	3639000	So I'm sorry.
3639000	3642000	It's like they keep grabbing for money
3642000	3644000	and EA's doing this shit now with loot boxes.
3644000	3646000	Everybody's doing loot boxes.
3646000	3649000	Not in the way that Overwatch is doing it.
3649000	3651000	And so what makes me...
3651000	3653000	If I see companies acting greedy,
3653000	3656000	what makes me think that I can trust them?
3656000	3658000	Why patent something like this
3658000	3659000	if you're not going to fucking use it?
3659000	3661000	You don't just come up with an idea like,
3661000	3663000	well, we'll just patent it for funsies.
3663000	3664000	I mean, no, they're going to do this
3664000	3666000	so that no one else can do it.
3666000	3668000	So Bobby Black Wolf,
3668000	3670000	who does the show before us here at VOG,
3670000	3673000	is needling your argument a little bit in chat,
3673000	3674000	getting you to think a little different here.
3674000	3676000	He says they could not do something
3676000	3678000	and I'd still hate them for it.
3678000	3680000	Kind of like hating Microsoft
3680000	3682000	because they thought about making the Xbox One
3682000	3684000	require an online connection
3684000	3687000	only to reverse course before the console comes out.
3687000	3688000	Exactly.
3688000	3689000	So you agree?
3689000	3690000	No, I agree.
3690000	3693000	You are agreeing with his point
3693000	3695000	that they could not do something
3695000	3697000	and you're going to hate them for it.
3697000	3699000	Right, because just the fact that they thought...
3699000	3701000	No, no, seriously though.
3701000	3703000	The fact that they went this far with an idea
3704000	3706000	and based on what we've seen so far.
3706000	3708000	So I'm basing off their past actions
3708000	3709000	like Call of Duty 4,
3709000	3711000	adding microtransactions to a game
3711000	3713000	that was good on its own.
3713000	3714000	They didn't need to put that in there.
3714000	3717000	Okay, because I'm sure Bobby's sitting there going,
3717000	3719000	well, that wasn't the response I expected.
3719000	3721000	What you're really trying to say is that
3721000	3723000	your issue is that
3723000	3726000	somebody in a boardroom at Activision
3726000	3730000	came up with this idea for a purpose
3730000	3733000	and based on Activision's track record,
3733000	3735000	which you don't think is so great
3735000	3737000	based on some of the other things they've done
3737000	3740000	in bringing Skylanders out, for example.
3740000	3742000	My kids try to watch that show.
3742000	3744000	Fuck, that's awful.
3744000	3746000	But yeah, it's...
3746000	3748000	So you are concerned that even though
3748000	3750000	Bungie is saying not in our game,
3750000	3754000	you go, because Activision bothered to take the time
3754000	3755000	to come up with it,
3755000	3758000	I'm still mad at them because this just shows
3758000	3762000	an assembly line of evil.
3762000	3764000	It's basically, it's kind of showing
3764000	3765000	where their mindset is.
3765000	3769000	And you see that with not only this patent,
3769000	3771000	but you see it with their past actions.
3771000	3774000	So with adding unnecessary loot boxes
3774000	3776000	and DLC systems into games
3776000	3778000	that didn't require them before.
3778000	3781000	Or for example, milking games,
3781000	3784000	milking franchises until they burn them into the ground,
3784000	3786000	a la Guitar Hero,
3786000	3789000	or even Skylanders if you want to go that far.
3789000	3794000	It's just, it's another example of the stuff
3794000	3796000	that we've seen them already doing.
3796000	3798000	And this is just taking it one step further.
3798000	3802000	And it's like, I wouldn't put it past them to do that.
3802000	3804000	Do I think that Destiny 2 has it in there?
3804000	3807000	I don't know, but I wouldn't put it past them to do that.
3807000	3809000	And just because it's not in there now,
3809000	3812000	who's to say that they couldn't do that on the back end
3812000	3813000	and you would be none the wiser?
3813000	3815000	I kind of feel like, Loki,
3815000	3818000	I actually kind of get where you're coming from.
3818000	3820000	Even looking at Bobby's counterpoint,
3820000	3822000	I understand the whole idea of,
3822000	3826000	I have trust issues with gaming companies
3826000	3828000	based on some of the shit I've seen in the past.
3828000	3830000	That part of it, I get.
3830000	3832000	But here's my thought, Loki,
3832000	3834000	is that you say, we can't prove it,
3834000	3836000	it could be in there and we don't know,
3836000	3837000	or anything like that.
3837000	3840000	Wouldn't Twitter figure that shit out in a heartbeat?
3840000	3842000	Like, hackers gonna hack, right?
3842000	3845000	Like, if something nefarious were to be happening in games,
3845000	3847000	people fucking are very observant
3847000	3851000	when it comes to things like patterns and changes.
3851000	3855000	Like, every time Pokemon Go does an update,
3855000	3857000	within five hours, somebody's gone in there
3857000	3858000	and hacked the update to tell you,
3858000	3861000	here's everything under the hood that's really changed.
3861000	3863000	Isn't that still gonna happen?
3863000	3865000	Isn't that gonna keep game companies accountable?
3865000	3868000	That's the part where I kind of disagree with you,
3868000	3871000	is I think if they change it, people are gonna find out.
3871000	3873000	They wouldn't know, because you're talking about,
3873000	3876000	you can hack the client all you want
3876000	3878000	and figure out what's in the client.
3878000	3880000	We're talking about matchmaking servers.
3880000	3883000	It's server software that's gonna be making these decisions.
3883000	3885000	And so whether, however, the client,
3885000	3887000	the client can just send over information
3887000	3890000	of what DLC you own, or like, the different stats,
3890000	3892000	or whatever, that they can probably sniff out,
3892000	3894000	if that's still a thing.
3894000	3896000	But I don't know how their algorithm's
3896000	3898000	working with something like this,
3898000	3900000	but to actually see the process of how they're matchmaking,
3900000	3901000	that's all on the server side.
3901000	3903000	You're not gonna actually get to see that.
3903000	3906000	Well, Dungeon Buster, with a fair kind of counterpoint,
3906000	3908000	without saying, people are still guesstimating RNG
3908000	3910000	in a wide range of MMOs.
3910000	3913000	So I mean, the scientific method, if you will,
3913000	3915000	could still be applied.
3915000	3918000	Well, and even with RNG stuff,
3918000	3920000	I mean, what's it say?
3920000	3924000	Because I've been in different games,
3924000	3926000	and it hasn't perfectly matched me with people.
3926000	3928000	Is that because of something like this,
3928000	3932000	or is that because it's just a shitty matchmaking process,
3932000	3934000	or based on the players that were available,
3934000	3936000	that was the closest they could match?
3936000	3937000	How are you gonna know?
3937000	3938000	There's so many factors.
3938000	3941000	But it's just the mindset that they would come up
3941000	3943000	with an idea like this that's evil.
3943000	3945000	That is what's evil.
3945000	3949000	I wanna do something a little unusual here on OLR,
3949000	3951000	but I really feel like there's another important
3951000	3953000	follow-up point that needs to be made.
3953000	3956000	Loki, can you get into your next story you have on show rule?
3956000	3958000	I wanna do things out of order here.
3958000	3959000	Sorry, Jamie.
3959000	3961000	But there's a reason.
3961000	3965000	So EA, they have shut down Visceral Games.
3965000	3968000	So Visceral Games was, of course,
3968000	3970000	they had produced different games,
3970000	3972000	like Battlefield Hardline,
3972000	3974000	of course the Dead Space series,
3974000	3977000	and they were working on a new Star Wars game.
3977000	3980000	Apparently they're saying now that Visceral Studios
3980000	3982000	has been developing an action-adventure title
3982000	3983000	set in the Star Wars universe,
3983000	3985000	which I think I've heard people describe it
3985000	3987000	as kind of like an uncharted type of game,
3987000	3989000	more of a single-player experience.
3989000	3991000	They're saying in its current form,
3991000	3994000	it was shaping up to be a story-based linear adventure game.
3994000	3995000	Throughout the development process,
3995000	3997000	we've been testing the game concepts with players,
3997000	4001000	listening to feedback about what and how they want to play,
4001000	4004000	and closely tracking fundamental shifts in the marketplace.
4004000	4007000	It has become clear the delivered experience of players
4007000	4010000	will want to come back to and enjoy for a long time to come.
4010000	4012000	We need to pivot the design.
4012000	4017000	So they're going to be ramping down and closing,
4017000	4023000	and I guess they're saying that a development team
4023000	4025000	from across worldwide studios
4025000	4027000	will take over developing Ragtag,
4027000	4029000	which was the game that they were,
4029000	4031000	the code name for the Star Wars game,
4031000	4033000	led by EA Vancouver,
4033000	4035000	a team that has already been working on the project.
4035000	4037000	Steve Anthony will lead this team,
4037000	4039000	and we will use much of the work
4039000	4041000	that has been done to date by Visceral
4041000	4043000	and the assets of Ragtag have already been built
4043000	4045000	will be the foundation of this new game.
4045000	4047000	So to make a long story short...
4047000	4048000	I'm sorry.
4048000	4050000	And then, of course, the assumption is
4050000	4053000	it's safe to presume that the new incarnation of the Star Wars game
4053000	4055000	will evolve to a Games as a Service element.
4055000	4056000	Right.
4056000	4058000	So to make a long story short, essentially,
4058000	4061000	it sounds like a single-player Star Wars...
4061000	4065000	We'll say Star Wars Uncharted, for lack of a better word.
4065000	4066000	Or Tomb Raider.
4066000	4069000	Or Tomb Raider was canceled in favor of a Star Wars Destiny.
4069000	4072000	Granted, I am oversimplifying this scenario,
4072000	4075000	but, you know, since most things are broken down
4075000	4078000	into a 140-character tweet these days anyway,
4078000	4080000	that is the Twitter version of what's going on here.
4080000	4083000	And you can see why I'm having you bring this up now
4083000	4085000	as a follow-up to what you just talked about,
4085000	4089000	because this has caused a huge conversation on the internet
4089000	4091000	and everywhere this week about
4091000	4094000	are single-player experiences done for?
4094000	4098000	Are we at a point where everything has to be fucking multiplayer
4098000	4101000	because game companies like EA, like Activision,
4101000	4105000	see it as the only way to recoup these large budgets...
4105000	4106000	No, no, no, no.
4106000	4108000	It's not the only way to recoup.
4108000	4110000	There's just a lot of money in online games
4110000	4112000	because you're basically...
4112000	4114000	You're constantly having stuff for sale.
4114000	4115000	Whereas a single-player game,
4115000	4117000	you're gonna have limited expansions and stuff like that.
4117000	4120000	They found out they can go the mobile route
4120000	4122000	and they can constantly have things for sale,
4122000	4123000	consumables for sale,
4123000	4126000	and then that'll tempt people into buying that stuff
4126000	4128000	and they can keep going that route,
4128000	4130000	like Grand Theft Auto Online has done with shark cards
4130000	4131000	and stuff like that,
4131000	4135000	trying to tempt you to get in that type of behavior pattern.
4135000	4136000	It's not...
4136000	4138000	They can say that all they want.
4138000	4142000	The AAA industry is not entirely 100% accurate on this stuff,
4142000	4143000	and that's fine.
4143000	4145000	They can go that route because, guess what?
4145000	4148000	There's a healthy, thriving indie marketplace,
4148000	4151000	and if they don't make the games that people want,
4151000	4153000	they will come in and make the games for you.
4153000	4156000	So they'll come out and make single-player experiences that you'll like,
4156000	4161000	but to think that that's the only way that they can recoup their money,
4161000	4162000	I'm sorry.
4162000	4164000	Maybe don't make games that fucking big.
4164000	4167000	If you have such a problem recouping your money
4167000	4169000	on these multi-million dollar games,
4169000	4171000	maybe lower the scope a bit so that you're not...
4171000	4174000	There's no reason you need to make these big,
4174000	4177000	blockbuster, graphically intense, licensed games.
4177000	4180000	Just make good games.
4181000	4183000	And I don't buy the bullshit for one second
4183000	4186000	that they need to have these microtransactions.
4186000	4187000	Yeah, they would like to tow that line,
4187000	4189000	and they would like to have people defend that,
4189000	4191000	because, oh, they gotta run those servers and shit.
4191000	4192000	Yes, I get it.
4192000	4193000	They have to pay for that stuff.
4193000	4194000	But you know what?
4194000	4196000	They've managed just fine before all this stuff happened.
4196000	4199000	It's now they got a taste of the money they can make from it,
4199000	4201000	and so that's why you're gonna see games come, you know,
4201000	4203000	with more and more of these types of things.
4203000	4204000	And that's fine.
4204000	4206000	If you're fine with that and you wanna tow that line,
4206000	4208000	that's the defense that they wanna take,
4208000	4209000	then go ahead and partake in those games.
4209000	4212000	I personally am not going to partake in those games,
4212000	4213000	because it's bullshit.
4213000	4215000	So at the end of the day, vote with your wallet.
4215000	4217000	That's gonna say the loudest thing at all.
4217000	4218000	Yeah.
4218000	4220000	Well, and you know, I know again earlier
4220000	4222000	you were picking on Nintendo a little bit
4222000	4224000	for some of their choices, but I can't help but think,
4224000	4226000	well, gosh, probably what's going to be
4226000	4229000	the best single-player experience of this year.
4229000	4231000	I mean, it's up for debate.
4231000	4233000	But certainly Zelda Breath of the Wild
4233000	4236000	is gonna be in everybody's top three or top five somewhere, right?
4237000	4240000	So, and then I'm sure, you know, the game's not out yet,
4240000	4242000	so we can't tell, but I have a pretty good feeling
4242000	4244000	Mario Odyssey is also going to deliver
4244000	4246000	a strong single-player experience.
4246000	4248000	So it is kind of interesting to me that
4248000	4251000	Nintendo now is seeming to rise up as that,
4251000	4255000	which is weird because Nintendo is also that party company, right?
4255000	4257000	Especially when it was the Wii.
4257000	4259000	It was like party games, party games, party games.
4259000	4262000	But like, I do feel like it's very hard to argue
4262000	4265000	that Zelda and likely Mario are going to be
4265000	4268000	probably two of the strongest single-player experiences.
4268000	4271000	So it's, Loki, I guess the reason why I'm bringing this up
4271000	4275000	is it's like, doesn't that kind of leave you with
4275000	4279000	Nintendo as like the choice to kind of go to with your wallet
4279000	4280000	because they're making those experiences?
4280000	4283000	No, it doesn't. They make good single-player games.
4283000	4285000	Sony makes good single-player games as well.
4285000	4288000	So I don't understand the argument that they think that it has to go all online
4288000	4290000	because there's a lot of games that they have
4290000	4292000	that are great single-player experiences that don't need online.
4292000	4295000	Uncharted, for example, has a great single-player experience.
4295000	4297000	Yeah, they kind of shoehorned some online in there.
4297000	4299000	Honestly, I don't think it's that great.
4299000	4304000	But they have, you know, lots of great single-player experience games.
4304000	4309000	Even with, Microsoft has some pretty good single-player games out there.
4309000	4312000	But I don't think it's going away forever.
4312000	4314000	I mean, especially when you're talking about games,
4314000	4317000	especially when they start shutting down these servers and stuff,
4317000	4320000	people don't want to invest in a single-player game because,
4320000	4322000	or in a multiplayer game like that,
4322000	4324000	that they know that eventually might get shut down
4324000	4326000	and their copy's completely useless.
4326000	4329000	Like, imagine when the servers get shut down for Gran Turismo Sport.
4329000	4330000	That's kind of crap.
4330000	4332000	All right, let me get to our chat because there's,
4332000	4335000	I just turned to look at chat and it's lighting up over there.
4335000	4338000	So let's get some voices from our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
4338000	4341000	Come on, Noel Gus, talks about Nintendo saying single-player
4341000	4344000	but amiibos are their loot boxes.
4344000	4349000	Mega Man X400 in chat says single-player games have large budgets
4349000	4352000	and when they don't sell five million copies, it's deemed a failure.
4352000	4355000	Square Enix deemed Tomb Raider a failure
4355000	4358000	until it sold over seven million copies.
4358000	4363000	SG100Matt says EA Sports makes more money with their in-game transaction services
4363000	4365000	than actual sales of the games.
4365000	4367000	Bobby says in a series here,
4367000	4371000	Random Joe Gamer doesn't want pixelated shit from indies.
4371000	4374000	They want big-budget, graphically impressive games.
4374000	4376000	That's what the wallets say.
4377000	4379000	I get where you're going with that
4379000	4382000	but then once in a while,
4382000	4386000	we have these like runaway fucking successes of the indie scene
4386000	4389000	like Minecraft, like Stardew Valley.
4389000	4392000	But to be fair, Minecraft is a game that is also online.
4392000	4394000	This cup had come out recently and that sold really well.
4394000	4396000	Okay, fair enough.
4396000	4399000	It's recent but people have been hyping that thing up forever.
4399000	4402000	And once again, here's the thing about it.
4402000	4404000	Let me quickly finish Bobby's point, sorry.
4404000	4406000	Andy is saying that's what the wallets are saying.
4406000	4409000	Wallets are voting for Games as a Service plus loot boxes.
4409000	4413000	And to be fair, and this is a point that is hard to dispute,
4413000	4418000	the top games played on Steam were PUBG, as I call it,
4418000	4420000	or Player Unknown Battleground, and Dota.
4420000	4424000	We did vote with our wallets. We voted for this.
4424000	4426000	Sorry, Loki. You want to finish your thought?
4426000	4429000	I definitely want to ask Jamie a different spin on this question.
4429000	4432000	Yeah, but they haven't always had loot boxes in PUBG to begin with.
4432000	4435000	Dota, that's a free-to-play game.
4435000	4438000	So, I mean, once again, free-to-play.
4438000	4441000	I don't really have a problem if you have loot boxes in a free-to-play game
4441000	4443000	because I didn't pay for the game.
4443000	4445000	So if I put money down for that, it's not a big deal
4445000	4447000	because it's like making a purchase for the game.
4447000	4450000	I have a problem when I drop $60 or something
4450000	4452000	and then they want more money on top of it
4452000	4454000	to get the full game and to get all this other crap.
4454000	4458000	So that's my problem because that's the double dipping that you see there.
4458000	4461000	And as far as indie games not selling as much, they don't have to
4461000	4463000	because, once again, they're an indie studio.
4463000	4464000	They don't need to make as much money
4464000	4467000	because they didn't put as much of a budget into it.
4467000	4468000	That's what I'm saying.
4468000	4470000	You don't need to recoup as much money
4470000	4472000	if you don't put as much money into it.
4472000	4474000	And you can still come up with a quality game.
4474000	4477000	There's a lot of really high-quality looking indie games
4477000	4482000	and they don't have to sell 7 million copies to make their money back.
4482000	4484000	Jamie, I want to ask you this question
4484000	4487000	because I know when it comes to a lot of the newer stuff
4487000	4490000	that's not really your bread and butter.
4490000	4492000	You really enjoy the classic games.
4492000	4495000	There are newer things that I know you enjoy like Danganronpa and things,
4495000	4497000	but those aren't necessarily the AAA titles either.
4497000	4500000	So let me ask you... Well, not here.
4500000	4504000	So let me ask you this because you're obviously listening to a lot of this
4504000	4508000	and this whole thing and although I know you don't really care about Destiny so much
4508000	4511000	and some of these things, let me ask you this question.
4511000	4514000	When you think about the future of the gaming industry
4514000	4516000	and hearing a lot of this that's going on
4516000	4519000	and knowing about what's going on, the loot bosses and stuff,
4519000	4521000	when you think about the future of the gaming industry,
4521000	4525000	are you hopeful or are you scared?
4525000	4530000	I wouldn't say I was scared. I'm a bit apprehensive.
4530000	4536000	More or less that it's just more and more how the big title games
4536000	4538000	are not going to be what draws my attention.
4538000	4542000	The more hype something is, the more suspect I am of it.
4542000	4548000	So I think though that as long as the indie development scene stays strong
4548000	4551000	and that most of these people can actually stay independent
4551000	4553000	and do things for the passion of the games,
4553000	4556000	then I feel good about that part of it.
4556000	4559000	But the big title stuff, I'll be honest,
4559000	4562000	I'm not interested in being a part of that machine.
4562000	4564000	Mass Effect aside.
4564000	4566000	And Dragon Ball.
4566000	4569000	Well, even with Mass Effect, because the chat room is obviously very tongue-in-cheek
4569000	4571000	saying, but Mass Effect and so forth,
4571000	4573000	okay, well, there's always exceptions to every rule, right?
4573000	4575000	So Dark Saga has Mass Effect.
4575000	4581000	Even with Mass Effect, fans are really hurt by what the machine did to Andromeda.
4581000	4585000	Yeah, I'm not going to buy Anthem. It's not getting my money.
4585000	4589000	I refuse because of how Mass Effect was treated.
4589000	4593000	And some people would say that's apples and oranges type of thing.
4593000	4597000	But in a way, it's kind of interesting because you saying that
4597000	4604000	is similar to how he says, I don't trust Activision to not implement this.
4604000	4606000	Just like this would be why I'd be worrying about BioWare
4606000	4608000	because I don't trust EA.
4608000	4611000	Look at Visceral. Look at all the other companies they've shut down
4611000	4613000	because of this kind of bullshit.
4613000	4617000	BioWare, their clock is ticking, sadly.
4617000	4621000	I do want to transition to another news story here and move on with our show.
4621000	4624000	But let me try to end, because the chat is very debating right now,
4624000	4626000	and it's great. I think these healthy debates are good.
4626000	4629000	But let me try to end on a positive note here.
4629000	4631000	What can EA Activision,
4631000	4636000	what can these larger third-party developers do to make you happy?
4636000	4638000	I guess for lack of a better term.
4638000	4641000	Keep their fucking fingers out of the franchises we love.
4641000	4643000	Stop trying to double dip on this shit.
4643000	4648000	Remember, they fucking pulled this stupid online pass bullshit not too long ago.
4648000	4651000	Remember, this is the same companies that did this kind of crap
4651000	4653000	because they needed this extra money, they claim.
4653000	4656000	Or it was a way to pirate used game sales.
4657000	4661000	All these excuses that they say that their games are not successful.
4661000	4665000	Their games are successful. They're making billions of fucking dollars a year.
4665000	4669000	So don't give me this bullshit that you're not making enough money.
4669000	4671000	They're making enough money. They just want more of it.
4671000	4674000	Because why? Why not? You always want more money.
4674000	4678000	But at what expense? You're going to basically sell out your user base.
4678000	4682000	And granted, there's people like, for example, Madden or FIFA
4682000	4685000	that buy the game each year because they're fans of that franchise.
4685000	4689000	They love the franchise and they'll keep buying it because they support that franchise.
4689000	4695000	But they're using that dedication to this franchise to shove this stuff in
4695000	4698000	because they're doing it a little bit at a time.
4698000	4702000	So that, you know, it's, oh, this is kind of a minor irritation.
4702000	4704000	But I love the game, I'm going to keep playing.
4704000	4706000	Oh, but they're adding something else this year.
4706000	4710000	Oh, okay, well, they're going to keep slowly integrating that stuff in there
4710000	4714000	until it finally becomes this mobile market almost.
4714000	4718000	And that's not good. And the problem is people being dedicated to this
4718000	4721000	are not really taking a stand to, you know, fight off the stuff.
4721000	4724000	Because they're like, well, remember the whole Call of Duty thing?
4724000	4726000	Like the non-dedicated servers and stuff like that.
4726000	4729000	Oh, man, I'm not buying Call of Duty this year. I'm boycotting it.
4729000	4731000	We're going to create this Steam group to boycott it.
4731000	4733000	And then everybody bought it.
4733000	4737000	It's just if you're going to actually put your foot down and not buy something,
4737000	4739000	you have to follow through with that.
4739000	4742000	And the problem is it's going to take a lot of people to do that.
4742000	4745000	And we've seen this already with some of the stuff where they have kind of
4745000	4749000	backed off of things because of, you know, the backlash from it.
4749000	4752000	I want to say Star Wars did that for a little bit.
4752000	4755000	The Battlefront II stuff, they've kind of backed off a little bit on that,
4755000	4757000	but not entirely.
4757000	4763000	So it's just going to be, I don't know, it's just going to be seen.
4763000	4765000	They're going to emulate what's going to sell well.
4765000	4768000	So if single player games are selling well, they're going to put out single player games.
4768000	4772000	If MMOs and Destiny, or if Overwatch is selling well, which it is,
4772000	4774000	they're going to make games like Overwatch.
4774000	4776000	They're just monkey see, monkey do.
4776000	4779000	Here's my hot take. Take it or leave it.
4779000	4785000	My suggestion to these companies would be what can you do for less money?
4785000	4789000	And I know that seems like a loaded question, but hear me out here.
4789000	4794000	Because instead of, and I don't mean to get games that are made on a cheaper budget,
4794000	4797000	I don't mean acquiring indies and things like that.
4797000	4802000	I mean using your talent and your resources that you already have.
4802000	4806000	What can you do for less money once in a while?
4806000	4808000	You don't necessarily have to do every game for less money.
4808000	4811000	Let me use Hollywood as an example.
4811000	4817000	I mean, after all, many of us kind of view the similarities in games and movies all the time.
4817000	4824000	So for example, I guess what I'm saying is not every video game has to be Titanic.
4824000	4826000	Obviously, Titanic was one of the biggest movies of all time.
4826000	4829000	At the time it was released, the biggest movie of all time,
4829000	4833000	but it also had a very big budget to go with it, right?
4833000	4837000	But I believe it was the same year or the year after Titanic came out,
4837000	4842000	there was another movie that actually, for its return on investment,
4842000	4850000	made more money based off of its budget than Titanic, basically,
4850000	4852000	when you break it down to percentages.
4852000	4854000	And it was a little comedy called There's Something About Mary.
4854000	4856000	You all remember that movie? Right?
4856000	4857000	So that movie...
4857000	4859000	That movie was fucking stupid.
4859000	4863000	It was stupid, but many people saw it because it made them laugh.
4863000	4867000	Or another example around the same time frame would be the Blair Witch Project,
4867000	4871000	which also kind of had its issues, but was made dirt cheap,
4871000	4873000	and then made a lot, a lot of money.
4873000	4876000	But that was a little more about an indie or so on.
4876000	4881000	So there's something about Mary example there is that that was still a big Hollywood studio,
4881000	4885000	and they used some of their higher talent, Cameron Diaz, Ben Stiller,
4885000	4889000	but they made a movie that was a little cheaper to make,
4889000	4892000	and they made a great investment off of that game
4892000	4895000	using resources that were within Hollywood and so forth.
4895000	4899000	So I guess my point is, I understand that gamers want the big graphics,
4899000	4902000	they want the big explosions, they want all of that,
4902000	4904000	and that's cool to do one or two of those games a year,
4904000	4908000	but does every game have to be that, or isn't there room for Mary?
4908000	4912000	Well, perfect example, they go back to the whole gaming industry about it too,
4912000	4915000	and this is going to be another one, look at PUBG.
4915000	4919000	PUBG doesn't have the greatest graphics in the world,
4919000	4922000	it's all about the gameplay, that's what gamers care about.
4922000	4923000	Or fucking Minecraft.
4923000	4925000	Or does the game play well, that's what it matters.
4925000	4929000	Like you could have a game like Battlefront, like Star Wars Battlefront,
4929000	4931000	it looked fucking gorgeous.
4931000	4934000	Was the gameplay there? Not exactly.
4934000	4936000	And the content was very limited as well,
4936000	4939000	because they spent all this time making the game look so nice that
4939000	4941000	they didn't put out any maps.
4941000	4944000	So that's the problem, it's like you have a game like PUBG
4944000	4949000	that's fucking running away, it's insane with the whole popularity and everything,
4949000	4952000	the graphics aren't like the top notch, but you know what, it's cheap,
4952000	4955000	it's functional, it works, it looks nice,
4955000	4959000	it doesn't have to be like fucking cinematic or anything,
4959000	4962000	but it's fun, and that's what's got people engaged, it's like gameplay.
4962000	4965000	You can make the game look so fucking amazing, beautiful and everything,
4965000	4968000	but it could play like absolute shit.
4968000	4973000	Like, I don't know, Mass Effect, the gameplay in the new Mass Effect,
4973000	4976000	I mean the game looks nice, but maybe the gameplay wasn't all there.
4976000	4978000	Actually the gameplay was pretty good.
4978000	4980000	Yeah, the gameplay was fine.
4980000	4982000	Fine, whatever, I don't play the game, so whatever.
4982000	4984000	It suffered for other reasons, it's fine.
4984000	4988000	My point is, there are games that they focus a lot on the graphics of the game
4988000	4991000	and everything, when they really should be focusing on the gameplay,
4991000	4993000	because that's what's really doing it.
4993000	4997000	And much to the fact that you're talking about the Blair Witch project and stuff,
4997000	5001000	studios saw that they can make a ton of money from these found footage.
5001000	5005000	And that's what they're doing, because it's a technique that they found
5005000	5009000	they can make a ton of bank on, and that's why they're doing microtransactions.
5009000	5013000	But at the same time, that's also why everybody's doing Battle Royale.
5014000	5016000	That's why, yes, exactly.
5016000	5020000	And the industry will follow what's popular, regardless of how much money they dump into it,
5020000	5024000	because I can tell you right now, they didn't dump that much money into PUBG,
5024000	5027000	where they needed to sell 7 million copies to recoup their money.
5027000	5029000	So that's the thing.
5029000	5033000	You're going to see more games like that, because they need to emulate it,
5033000	5036000	because they want to ride the coattails of that to make some money,
5036000	5039000	because they think that's where people want to go.
5039000	5041000	That's the type of games they want to play.
5041000	5043000	It ends up being a fun game.
5043000	5045000	You can make other fun games that are different concepts.
5045000	5047000	You don't have to copy everything.
5047000	5049000	Really good discussion, you guys, for time.
5049000	5051000	I'm going to move on, though.
5051000	5053000	But if you want to elaborate, you have more thoughts on this,
5053000	5055000	feel free to drop us a line at some point.
5055000	5058000	Participate at orangeloungeradio.com,
5058000	5061000	or maybe a little later in the show we'll have some time to take some calls.
5061000	5065000	So let's move on for now, though, and talk a little bit about
5065000	5068000	an interesting publishing move, I suppose,
5068000	5072000	and an interesting headline that really will grab your attention.
5072000	5075000	Is Sony about to make Nintendo Switch games?
5075000	5077000	Kind of, is the answer there.
5077000	5082000	So here's what's going on, is that Sony, in a Japanese press release,
5082000	5086000	announced a publishing label named Unties,
5086000	5090000	which is trying to, I guess, find indie games,
5090000	5094000	such as, I think, Tiny Metal is the first game they've teamed up with.
5094000	5097000	They are going to release this game on PlayStation 4,
5097000	5101000	Nintendo Switch, and PC.
5101000	5104000	You'll notice there's a company that's very absent from that,
5104000	5109000	but to be fair, this is Japanese based and Microsoft is not a factor in Japan.
5109000	5111000	That could be playing into it too.
5111000	5114000	Don't they have a portable console too?
5114000	5117000	Not anymore.
5117000	5120000	Are we talking about Vita, what?
5120000	5124000	Good point. Anyway, the game is coming out on November 21st,
5124000	5128000	and some other games that will be published by this company.
5128000	5133000	Last Standard, and a tank game called Merkava Avalanche,
5133000	5136000	which is only for PC right now.
5136000	5138000	There's also a game called Demo Reborn
5138000	5142000	that's headed for PlayStation VR as well as PC as well.
5142000	5147000	So, anyway, it's interesting that this Sony arm is looking at publishing,
5147000	5149000	not just on Sony platforms.
5149000	5152000	I mean, I could go really old school and say,
5152000	5155000	well, it's not the first time that Sony's worked with Nintendo
5155000	5160000	because one of my favorite games they ever did release on Super Nintendo
5160000	5162000	was Equinox.
5162000	5165000	And that was a Super Nintendo game that, when you boot it up,
5165000	5168000	has Sony ImageSoft's logo in the beginning of it.
5168000	5170000	And, of course, they originally collaborated with them to make the PlayStation.
5170000	5172000	Sure, sure, which, you know, we never have that.
5172000	5175000	But anyway, obviously, that's old news at this point.
5175000	5177000	You know, we're digging up shit from 20, 30 years ago.
5177000	5181000	But it is interesting to see that Sony is kind of going,
5181000	5184000	okay, well, if there's money to be made by doing this,
5184000	5186000	then we're going to do it.
5186000	5189000	But it's also, it's not really Sony's name.
5189000	5192000	It's Sony owns this publishing arm,
5192000	5195000	but it sounds like they can kind of work independently
5195000	5200000	and maybe don't have to do everything 100% Sony.
5200000	5202000	So, kind of interesting.
5204000	5207000	Dark Tetsuya in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,
5207000	5210000	I think they also published the hook movie game.
5210000	5213000	And actf says, Mickey Mania was published by Sony too.
5213000	5215000	Yeah, I mean, back in the day, in the 8-bit and 16-bit,
5215000	5218000	you know, before Sony, you know, like we said,
5218000	5221000	attempted the PlayStation, and then they separated
5221000	5223000	and went their own direction with it.
5223000	5225000	And look where we are now.
5225000	5227000	You know, before then, Sony was publishing games.
5227000	5230000	But to be fair, it's a little apples and oranges
5230000	5232000	versus what was happening in the 90s
5232000	5234000	and what's happening today, especially now
5234000	5236000	that we're throwing PC into the mix as well,
5236000	5238000	which is, you know, a very wide open type of platform.
5238000	5242000	So, anyway, it'd be interesting to see what develops from that.
5242000	5245000	But at this time, you know, when you see a headline like that,
5245000	5249000	don't fucking assume that, oh, Uncharted is going to come out
5249000	5252000	on Nintendo Switch. No, no, no, no.
5252000	5254000	It's not going to happen like that.
5254000	5257000	Not for a good long time for some serious things
5257000	5259000	to change in the industry first.
5259000	5262000	Meanwhile, back to what's happening today.
5262000	5264000	Dark Sakura, you have something for us.
5264000	5266000	Yeah, I'll keep it quick.
5266000	5269000	Pokemon Go, with their newest update,
5269000	5274000	they put in something that detects apps that can be used for spoofing.
5274000	5278000	Big anti-cheat protection that actually pops up a little window
5278000	5281000	saying that, yeah, we detect this stuff, knock it off.
5281000	5286000	But 20 minutes later, they already figured it out.
5286000	5290000	So, they actually, as far as I can tell, took out that little pop-up now,
5290000	5295000	I guess, until they can find another way to keep it from being circumvented.
5295000	5302000	But, yeah, you know, they're trying, I think, to go the route of warning
5302000	5304000	before going the full perma-ban.
5304000	5308000	So, I don't know. I don't do that.
5308000	5311000	I don't think it ruins the game because, honestly enough,
5311000	5313000	it doesn't affect how I play it.
5313000	5316000	So, I don't care what these other people do.
5316000	5319000	I don't like the spoofing of the gems and all that.
5319000	5321000	That kind of ruins it.
5321000	5322000	I don't do gems, though.
5322000	5324000	Really? Well, I do. So, I don't like it.
5324000	5327000	And the spoofing really fucks up Ingress,
5327000	5330000	and Ingress had its whole other set of drama this week,
5330000	5334000	which, you know, not to get too far into that, Loki, you saw that one, right?
5334000	5338000	Finally, the fucking receipts came out on why your Guardians went down on day 89.
5338000	5340000	But, anyway, that's a whole other story.
5340000	5343000	That wasn't spoofing, per se, but that was a whole other...
5343000	5344000	It was.
5344000	5346000	Yeah, it can be. Sometimes it is.
5346000	5351000	It was in this case because it's closed unless they were doing some major trespassing.
5351000	5352000	True, true.
5352000	5357000	Anyway, spoofing in GPS games is bad.
5357000	5361000	But usually we're into, to Jamie's credit, where Pokémon kind of escapes this,
5361000	5363000	is that for a lot of people, catching them all,
5363000	5365000	it doesn't matter how other people catch them all.
5365000	5368000	And if you do avoid the gym game, then the spoofing thing doesn't matter.
5368000	5372000	But I think for the integrity of the game, it's probably for the best.
5372000	5376000	Because if Niantic's going to continue to do these region exclusives
5376000	5380000	for Pokémon like Farfetch'd, let's say,
5380000	5383000	if it was open wide for people to be spoofing and stuff,
5383000	5386000	then when they open up trading eventually,
5386000	5390000	those regional exclusives are going to lose a lot of value, if that makes sense.
5390000	5391000	Yeah.
5391000	5394000	I appreciate them trying to do something.
5394000	5397000	So all they're doing is just checking what the app name is,
5397000	5399000	because that's kind of lame, because you can just rename your apps anyways,
5399000	5404000	especially if you're running a system that's rooted to be able to spoof that stuff.
5404000	5408000	I don't know if we necessarily know 100% of what they're doing,
5408000	5409000	because some of it's kind of behind the scenes.
5409000	5412000	I thought that they had better detection of that stuff on Ingress,
5412000	5415000	but it seems like there's spoofers all over the place,
5415000	5417000	so I don't understand why this is still such a problem.
5417000	5420000	It's been getting better, and they're getting banned faster,
5420000	5422000	but it's not fixed.
5422000	5425000	Sounds like it's probably manual with them then.
5425000	5426000	Perhaps.
5426000	5427000	Manually detecting stuff.
5427000	5428000	Perhaps.
5428000	5432000	All right, well, one more story before we get to our classic game of the week,
5432000	5436000	and it has to do with checking in on Microsoft and the Xbox
5436000	5439000	and the original Xbox compatibility.
5439000	5441000	Yes, it is still coming for 2017,
5441000	5445000	and that's according to Phil Spencer over at Xbox.
5445000	5449000	He says that people are going to talk about specifically
5449000	5452000	how compatibility is going to work on Xbox One X,
5452000	5455000	and I think people will find it pretty interesting.
5455000	5460000	But apparently there is a leak or something that made its way onto Reddit
5460000	5464000	that there was some games that were actually listed for original Xbox titles,
5464000	5469000	so people are anticipating that these games would actually make their way
5469000	5471000	to the Xbox compatibility.
5471000	5474000	We know about Crimson Skies, but also Fusion Frenzy,
5474000	5479000	Red Faction 2, Dead to Rights, and King of Fighters Neo Wave
5479000	5483000	are all anticipated to be in that first Neo Wave,
5483000	5485000	if you will, of Xbox compatible games.
5485000	5486000	So that would be pretty cool.
5486000	5490000	And I'm curious what he talks about with the Xbox One X doing it uniquely.
5490000	5492000	I'm curious to see what that's going to entail.
5492000	5496000	Unfortunately, I don't own a lot of original Xbox games,
5496000	5498000	and none of them were on that list,
5498000	5500000	but I'll be curious to see what happens.
5500000	5502000	All right.
5502000	5504000	Well, let's take a trip down memory lane
5504000	5508000	and visit some other classic games that you could play today
5508000	5510000	if you just take a little damn effort.
5510000	5514000	Dark Soccer is going to step into the gaming vault
5514000	5515000	and find a game that she thinks,
5515000	5518000	hey, you brats should be checking out this game.
5518000	5523000	Stop spoofing in Pokémon Go and stop opening loot boxes
5523000	5524000	and play this instead.
5524000	5526000	Dark Soccer, what's the classic in the league?
5526000	5530000	Well, while I've been on my Irem kick lately,
5530000	5532000	I decided to pick another Irem game,
5532000	5536000	a different type of shooter that they did called Image Fight.
5536000	5538000	Y'all remember that one?
5538000	5540000	No, I never played it, to be honest.
5540000	5546000	Image Fight came out in 1988, and it came out in arcade.
5546000	5550000	It was also out on the NES, the PC Engine in Japan,
5550000	5554000	the Sharp X68000, and the FM Towns,
5554000	5560000	which I have covered the FM Towns for a previous system of the month.
5560000	5565000	So basically, it is a horizontal shooter,
5565000	5567000	although it's supposed to have, well,
5567000	5571000	it does have actually a number of similarities with R-Type.
5571000	5576000	You play a ship that actually ended up in R-Type Final
5576000	5579000	called the OF-1 Daedalus,
5579000	5584000	and then you basically just go around shooting shit.
5584000	5589000	You get this thing called a pod,
5589000	5593000	which is a small colored sphere that has gun barrels on it,
5593000	5597000	kind of like an option in some of the Gradius games.
5597000	5599000	But the pod will float beside you.
5599000	5603000	You get a red pod that changes direction based on how you move the ship,
5603000	5605000	so it can be aimed at other enemies,
5605000	5609000	and then the blue pod, which will always point forward,
5609000	5613000	but it's more powerful, just a little bit less versatile.
5613000	5615000	You also get the pod shot,
5615000	5619000	where your side pods can be launched at high speed,
5619000	5623000	kind of like how you shoot the front shield in R-Type,
5623000	5627000	and then it will circle back and come back to the ship.
5627000	5630000	So you can use them like they're projectiles as well.
5630000	5633000	So, like I said, it has quite a few things in common with R-Type.
5633000	5636000	You also have different speed controls
5636000	5639000	so that you can be a little bit more precise,
5639000	5644000	and you have little transformations that will happen with the main ship,
5644000	5649000	like the wings angling back down if you're going at higher speeds,
5649000	5653000	and the thruster color of the ship changes.
5653000	5658000	And you can use, basically when you make the change,
5658000	5661000	the thrusters will shoot out a blue flame
5661000	5665000	that you can use as a weapon to damage other enemies too.
5665000	5667000	And then you get these things called forces.
5667000	5670000	They're these little kind of butterfly-like things
5670000	5672000	that attach to the front of the ship.
5672000	5676000	They're very much like the force in R-Type,
5676000	5681000	and they'll turn your blaster into a stronger laser.
5681000	5684000	They're also a shield of sorts as well,
5684000	5687000	but these can't be ejected,
5687000	5692000	so you only can eject your pods like you could the force in R-Type.
5692000	5699000	Once you have it attached, you can't pick up a new one,
5699000	5701000	but you can get different ones,
5701000	5705000	and the names of the various weapons actually come from R-Type finals,
5705000	5708000	so it really has a lot.
5708000	5710000	It's supposed to be a different universe,
5710000	5712000	so it really does have a lot in common with R-Type.
5712000	5714000	So as for those versions that came out,
5714000	5718000	we had, of course, the NES version,
5718000	5721000	and in Japan there was the PC Engine,
5721000	5725000	Sharp X68000, and the FM Towns, which came out in 1990.
5725000	5730000	The PC Engine version came out in Japan on Virtual Console,
5730000	5735000	and then Image Fight was also released in Japan
5735000	5742000	for PlayStation and Saturn with another game called X-Multiply,
5742000	5745000	so it was released in a compilation there.
5745000	5750000	There was a sequel called Image Fight 2 Operation Deep Striker,
5750000	5753000	which just makes me laugh.
5753000	5756000	It came out on PC Engine Super CD-ROM,
5756000	5758000	which I kind of would like it,
5758000	5762000	because I really only have two other arcade card games,
5762000	5765000	although if somebody can get me a Duo RX,
5765000	5768000	please let me know, because I want to use arcade card games.
5768000	5773000	But it was also re-released for Virtual Console in Japan.
5773000	5777000	And like I said, the ship from this game, the Daedalus,
5777000	5782000	was part of the ship, so you could choose from an R-Type final,
5782000	5787000	and it was called the OF Series.
5787000	5789000	So there you go.
5789000	5796000	And also, now this was referenced by the creator of Radiant Silver Gun,
5796000	5803000	Iuchi Hiroshi, who said that Image Fight was the inspiration for Radiant Silver Gun.
5803000	5806000	And Itagaki, you know, dead or alive guy,
5806000	5810000	basically said that Image Fight is one of his favorite games.
5810000	5812000	That's some big endorsements.
5812000	5813000	Yeah.
5813000	5818000	I hadn't played Image Fight since I was a kid,
5818000	5820000	at least an early teenager.
5820000	5824000	So remembering that this was another Irem game actually was kind of fun.
5824000	5828000	So Image Fight's the classic game.
5828000	5832000	All right. There it is, your classic game of the week, Image Fight.
5832000	5833000	Check it out.
5833000	5834000	And I have to admit, this is one.
5834000	5836000	I didn't play a lot, a lot of shooter games, though,
5836000	5840000	so I'm not surprised I missed this one, but this is one I've been learning about tonight.
5840000	5842000	But some of our chatters were familiar with this.
5842000	5844000	Dark Tetsuya saying, I played Image Fight, too.
5844000	5845000	It's pretty great.
5845000	5847000	It was emulated, but it was still pretty fun.
5847000	5849000	Well, sometimes emulators are all you got,
5849000	5851000	but do try to find the originals if you can.
5851000	5855000	But seriously, if someone can get me a Duo RX on the cheap,
5855000	5857000	I'm actually very serious about that.
5857000	5858000	I know.
5858000	5861000	You know, like maybe 100 instead of, you know, 250.
5861000	5862000	Like, I found them.
5862000	5864000	Jamie wants a Duo RX.
5864000	5866000	It needs to be in the vault.
5866000	5867000	All right.
5867000	5869000	Before we let you go, because I know, Jamie,
5869000	5871000	you're not going to be able to join us for the second half tonight
5871000	5872000	because you have other things to tend to,
5872000	5876000	but did you want to quickly throw out your rapid fire stories before you go?
5876000	5877000	Sure.
5877000	5878000	I'll throw them up for you.
5878000	5879000	Bah.
5879000	5880000	Bleh.
5880000	5884000	Anyway, Destiny 2 was going to have trials,
5884000	5888000	and they've actually been pulled off.
5888000	5891000	They've delayed them for two weeks because of a glitch
5891000	5898000	that would put players out of bounds to hide using their emotes.
5898000	5901000	So, yeah, that's been put aside.
5901000	5905000	But the emote that they got you out of bounds of was the funniest part of that.
5906000	5907000	Hmm.
5907000	5908000	Which one was it?
5908000	5909000	The silly walk.
5909000	5910000	Oh, yeah.
5910000	5911000	I'm looking at it now.
5911000	5915000	Oh, it's totally Monty Python as well.
5915000	5916000	That's great.
5916000	5920000	And then two more characters released, well, sorry,
5920000	5922000	announced for Dragon Ball FighterZ,
5922000	5925000	which honestly enough kind of surprises me
5925000	5928000	because I don't think they've been in any of the home fighting games
5928000	5932000	or at least super playable,
5932000	5935000	but it's Captain Ginyu, which would be fun.
5935000	5938000	I mean, I wonder if he'll have the whole body swap thing.
5938000	5940000	That would be really, really crazy if he did.
5940000	5944000	And Napa, so there you go.
5944000	5945000	New characters.
5945000	5950000	Yeah, but I have certain other characters that I'd like to see in it that are playable.
5950000	5953000	Well, it's not over yet, so maybe you'll get that in a future week.
5953000	5958000	I want them to put in some of the new characters from Dragon Ball Super.
5958000	5961000	Like, I'd like to see Ribrianne in it
5961000	5963000	because she's just absolutely hilarious.
5963000	5966000	Total spoof character on the magical girl genre.
5966000	5971000	And I want Caulifla, the other lady Saya Jean
5971000	5973000	because she's kind of badass.
5973000	5975000	Well, crossing my fingers and toes, you get what you want.
5975000	5978000	I want to get what I want.
5978000	5979000	Whatever, I do what I want.
5979000	5983000	All right, Jamie, before you leave us tonight, your final thought, please.
5983000	5986000	It doesn't matter how old you are, Halloween is for everybody.
5986000	5988000	You can go trick-or-treating as an adult.
5988000	5990000	Have a good costume.
5990000	5992000	Yeah, you have to have a good costume.
5992000	5996000	And donate your candy to children who are needy.
5996000	5997000	All right.
5997000	5999000	But save the good ones for yourself.
5999000	6003000	All right, that's going to do it for the first part of our show,
6003000	6006000	but we still have more to come, including your calls at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype,
6006000	6008000	and we're going to get to your emails.
6008000	6009000	We do have a couple of those tonight.
6009000	6011000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
6011000	6013000	See, Jamie leaves early, so she makes me read them instead.
6013000	6014000	No, I'm just kidding.
6014000	6017000	But I'm looking forward to all that when we come back after a quick break
6017000	6020000	with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
6027000	6030000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
6030000	6035000	Live tonight with episode 705 of our show already in progress
6035000	6039000	for this October 22nd, 2017.
6039000	6041000	I can't believe it's almost Halloween.
6041000	6043000	Man, how time flies.
6043000	6046000	Jamie has left the building, but JD has his own mic now,
6046000	6048000	so maybe you can hear from him a little more this segment.
6048000	6049000	Let's hope.
6049000	6050000	Let's hope.
6050000	6052000	How are you doing over there, JD? Enjoying the show so far tonight?
6052000	6053000	Yeah, it's been good.
6053000	6054000	Good.
6054000	6056000	So, hey, I thought the listeners would get a kick out of this
6056000	6058000	because we went to the mall yesterday, and there's this new store there
6058000	6062000	that I'd never seen before, and it was nothing but import candy.
6062000	6065000	We haven't had a good OLR foodio segment tonight,
6065000	6070000	so what kind of import candy did we get and eat?
6070000	6074000	Because we're fat, but that's all right. I'm fat, not you.
6074000	6078000	I mean, I am trying to lose weight, but...
6078000	6080000	Well, that ain't gonna help.
6080000	6083000	Yeah, we got matcha Kit Kats, the green tea flavor.
6083000	6084000	Yeah.
6084000	6089000	We got the, there was like a Mozart piano bar of chocolate.
6089000	6091000	What does that even taste like? Did you eat it yet?
6091000	6094000	I haven't opened it yet. I think it's marzipan, but I'll have to check.
6094000	6095000	Yeah.
6095000	6096000	Marzipan's good.
6097000	6101000	Various Kit Kats that were Oreo or cookies and cream or peanut butter or something.
6101000	6105000	Yeah, Kit Kats from, because this place not just had Japanese import candy,
6105000	6107000	but it had from Great Britain.
6107000	6108000	Yeah, it had European.
6108000	6110000	Where Cadbury's really good.
6110000	6113000	Right, so we checked the labels, and it wasn't Cadbury in the US,
6113000	6115000	because that's owned by Hershey's or somebody.
6115000	6118000	It was Cadbury UK, which is definitely better.
6118000	6119000	Yeah.
6119000	6121000	They had arrows. We didn't get any of them.
6121000	6124000	No, because they didn't have the mint arrows, which is my favorite flavor.
6124000	6126000	They didn't have the, like, regular generic chocolate ones.
6126000	6128000	They even had pretty big Toblerones.
6128000	6129000	Yeah.
6129000	6130000	I don't know if it was a giant Toblerone, but...
6130000	6132000	Whereas, it's funny, because I can just imagine,
6132000	6134000	like, we have some overseas listeners in the UK right now going,
6134000	6136000	really? You guys, like, freak out about that?
6136000	6138000	But we don't, we never see it here.
6138000	6142000	It would be like if I sent you pumpkin pie pop tarts,
6142000	6145000	which is like, it's what they have at Target right now.
6145000	6146000	You can get that anyway.
6146000	6149000	Or what's the candy they don't get overseas?
6149000	6152000	The Wonka candy, like, Laffy Taffy.
6152000	6153000	Is that Wonka?
6153000	6156000	Yeah, I think so. I think it's one of the earlier ones.
6156000	6160000	The Gobstoppers, which are okay. I think they're nerds.
6160000	6161000	Nerds are also, yeah.
6161000	6163000	That's the big nerds. You don't get that overseas.
6163000	6165000	They also had UK Smarties.
6165000	6168000	Yeah. Which here, Smarties are, like, different.
6168000	6170000	Little tiny chalky things, yeah.
6170000	6173000	They're like chalky, tangy things, whereas it's like M&Ms.
6173000	6175000	I think they're like our sweet tarts.
6175000	6176000	Yeah.
6176000	6180000	Oh, good question. William 2DS XL Face asks,
6180000	6182000	did they have Stroopwafel?
6182000	6184000	I didn't look for that, but Stroopwafel, like,
6184000	6187000	Starbucks sells a knockoff Stroopwafel thing now.
6187000	6189000	Like, those things are showing up everywhere.
6189000	6190000	I don't think it's a grocery store now.
6190000	6191000	I don't think it's a knockoff,
6191000	6193000	because it's not like a trademark brand.
6193000	6194000	Yeah.
6194000	6196000	But yeah, we saw when we went to Starbucks yesterday.
6196000	6197000	Waffle cookies.
6197000	6199000	Somebody was eating a Stroopwafel, so.
6199000	6202000	And then William also asks, what about Kinder eggs?
6202000	6204000	I didn't even think to look for those, but I think-
6204000	6206000	I thought they don't sell those anymore.
6206000	6207000	Yeah, I think it's still-
6207000	6208000	I think they're still illegal.
6208000	6210000	It's still illegal to sell those here, I think,
6210000	6213000	because it is still a store in the U.S.,
6213000	6215000	so I don't think you can technically sell those.
6215000	6216000	Right.
6216000	6217000	Yeah, so I didn't see those.
6217000	6220000	I heard they were supposed to release Kinder eggs in the U.S.,
6220000	6222000	but they were gonna be different where, like,
6222000	6225000	the shell was wrapped, and you had to open that,
6225000	6227000	and then, I don't know how-
6227000	6228000	Yeah.
6228000	6229000	It was gonna- Italian wasn't even the same thing.
6229000	6232000	They were gonna, like, make it idiot-proof or something.
6232000	6233000	Yeah.
6233000	6236000	Yeah, basically, like, you tear apart the two halves of the shell,
6236000	6238000	and it's two individually wrapped pieces of candy.
6238000	6239000	Which is not the same thing.
6239000	6241000	Yeah, it's not the same thing. It's really not.
6241000	6244000	Anyway, there you go, your little candy break here at OLR.
6244000	6246000	Now that I've given you all a sweet tooth,
6246000	6249000	let's get into some rapid-fire news, Loki.
6249000	6252000	So, this is very exciting, but one of the-
6252000	6254000	one of my favorite games to play in the arcade
6254000	6258000	used to be the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle 4-player arcade cabinet, and-
6258000	6259000	Who didn't like that game?
6259000	6260000	Yeah, exactly.
6260000	6261000	Who didn't like that game?
6261000	6262000	Who doesn't like that?
6262000	6263000	Except for the fact that it would, like,
6263000	6265000	go through your entire roll of quarters.
6265000	6268000	Right. Well, that opportunity may present itself again,
6268000	6269000	because guess what?
6269000	6274000	Raw Thrills is making a brand new TMNT 4-player arcade cabinet
6274000	6277000	based off of the new- of the Nickelodeon show.
6277000	6282000	So, it's gonna be four players with a giant 55-inch HD screen.
6283000	6286000	Doesn't Raw Thrills do all those ticket spinner games, though?
6286000	6289000	And there are redemption options, so you can spit-
6289000	6291000	well, you can spit tickets, but it's an option.
6291000	6292000	You don't need to do that.
6292000	6294000	Isn't that weird, though?
6294000	6295000	I mean, it's not weird.
6295000	6298000	It's, like, one of those kind of obvious but sad things now,
6298000	6300000	where it's like, in order to have an arcade game,
6300000	6302000	it has to have a ticket option now,
6302000	6304000	because that's what arcades are.
6304000	6305000	Yeah.
6305000	6307000	It was like, JD and I went to the casino here locally,
6307000	6309000	because JD had never been to a casino-
6309000	6311000	well, since you were 21 and not been to a casino.
6311000	6312000	Yeah.
6312000	6313000	So, I was like, let's go gamble.
6313000	6316000	So, we went to one of the local casinos here,
6316000	6319000	which, you know, they have on Native American land,
6319000	6320000	they are allowed to build casinos.
6320000	6323000	That's why we have some casinos in California, but not a lot.
6323000	6326000	So, we went to a local place of the freeway here, Red Hawk,
6326000	6329000	which we picked because it's closest,
6329000	6330000	but you asked, you were like,
6330000	6332000	oh, should we go to the arcade?
6332000	6333000	And you're probably thinking, like,
6333000	6335000	oh, they probably got DDR and all that stuff there.
6335000	6338000	And I'm like, it's going to be a bunch of nothing but ticket spitters.
6338000	6340000	Like, it is not- if you want to go play DDR,
6340000	6342000	you got to go to round one or something, you know?
6342000	6343000	I was going to say, like-
6343000	6344000	Or Dave & Buster's, at least.
6344000	6346000	I'd heard decent things about casino arcades in Reno,
6346000	6349000	but, like, Reno is more of a big gambling thing than-
6349000	6352000	I used to go to the Circus Circus arcade all the time in Reno.
6352000	6354000	I think they closed, didn't they?
6354000	6355000	No, I don't know.
6355000	6356000	Circus Circus is still going in Reno.
6356000	6358000	You know, I was thinking the Sahara.
6360000	6362000	Yeah, oh, no, the Sahara's in Vegas.
6362000	6363000	Right, right.
6363000	6364000	Yes, it closed.
6364000	6366000	But the Sahara's going to reopen with a new name,
6366000	6368000	and I think they probably renovated the building.
6368000	6369000	That's all Vegas.
6369000	6370000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
6370000	6371000	But Vegas, you have other options.
6371000	6373000	Like, you can go to the Pinball Museum in Vegas.
6373000	6375000	Of course, there's a Pinball Museum in the Bay Area, too, if I remember right.
6375000	6376000	It's in Alameda.
6376000	6377000	Yeah.
6377000	6379000	So, and I talked a couple weeks ago.
6379000	6381000	We went on that random jaunt over to Oakland
6381000	6384000	and went to that- I can't remember the name of it now.
6384000	6385000	It wasn't a museum, but it was a-
6385000	6387000	The Video Game History Museum.
6387000	6388000	Oh, it was a museum.
6388000	6389000	Okay, Video Game History Museum.
6389000	6390000	So, it was fun.
6390000	6395000	Anyway, sorry we talked about museums as a tangent from your Ninja Turtles game,
6395000	6399000	but maybe the old Ninja Turtles game will turn up in a museum someday.
6399000	6400000	It belongs in a museum.
6400000	6401000	It does.
6401000	6402000	It's my childhood right there.
6402000	6405000	Just put a full round table pizza with that in a museum.
6405000	6407000	Well, anyways, they're showing this off.
6407000	6410000	It's going to be at the IAPA.
6410000	6414000	So, looks neat.
6414000	6418000	I mean, just trying to kind of peek at the screenshot there.
6418000	6419000	I mean, it looks pretty.
6419000	6421000	I hope a game like that does end up coming to consoles,
6421000	6426000	because, shit, modern arcades aren't really running on proprietary hardware anymore.
6426000	6427000	It's pretty much all PCs.
6427000	6428000	Right.
6428000	6429000	Right.
6429000	6430000	I don't know.
6430000	6431000	I want to see that.
6431000	6432000	I definitely will check it out and play it.
6432000	6434000	If I ever get around to an arcade, it has it.
6434000	6435000	So, pretty awesome.
6435000	6441000	And then, speaking of cool games, they've got some mini games
6441000	6444000	that are within the new Resident Evil Revelation games
6444000	6446000	that are being ported over the Switch.
6446000	6449000	So, the Switch versions of Resident Evil Revelations 1 and 2
6449000	6452000	will have a new raid mode in it,
6452000	6456000	and each of those are going to have kind of a special mini game.
6456000	6459000	So, the first one in Revelations 1 is going to be Ghost Ship Panic,
6459000	6461000	and it's like a vertical shooter.
6461000	6466000	And then, they also have, in the second one,
6466000	6469000	they're going to have Ghouls and Homunculi,
6469000	6474000	which is kind of a spoof of Ghosts and Goblins.
6474000	6476000	So, that's pretty awesome.
6476000	6477000	Oh, I see.
6477000	6478000	So, they're, like, spoofing their own games.
6478000	6479000	Yeah, because it's Capcom.
6479000	6480000	Cute.
6480000	6481000	They can do that.
6481000	6482000	Of course.
6482000	6483000	If you're interested in checking those out,
6483000	6485000	they'll be coming out on the Switch on November 28th.
6485000	6486000	Dartusuya says,
6486000	6488000	I saw some video of those modes.
6488000	6489000	The Ghost Ship one looked okay,
6489000	6492000	but the Ghost and Goblins knockoff sounded neat.
6492000	6493000	So, yeah.
6493000	6494000	All right.
6494000	6499000	Moving over to a possible new release on the Nintendo Switch from Ubisoft.
6499000	6503000	Uno is a game that they're looking at releasing on the Nintendo Switch.
6503000	6506000	Apparently, this is through a recent PEGI rating,
6506000	6509000	which is, you know, one of the ratings boards overseas.
6509000	6513000	That is something that looks like it's been rated recently.
6513000	6515000	However, there's been no official announcement,
6515000	6517000	but it does make a lot of sense
6517000	6520000	that a game like Uno would come out for the Nintendo Switch.
6520000	6522000	I can't help but think back to the days
6522000	6528000	of when Uno was, like, the reason to own an Xbox camera
6528000	6529000	and you could play online.
6529000	6530000	Remember?
6530000	6531000	Yeah.
6531000	6533000	Some of our old in-jokes, like, draw four, bitch,
6533000	6535000	from Uno and the webcam.
6535000	6539000	Who knew that that is how gaming would just turn into for everything?
6539000	6540000	Mm-hmm.
6540000	6544000	Anyhow, enjoy Uno,
6544000	6546000	but try to turn it down a little bit.
6546000	6548000	Well, actually, you won't be able to yell and scream at video
6548000	6551000	and show nudes on video chat because it's the Nintendo Switch.
6551000	6553000	And as we talked about earlier, Nintendo doesn't know how to handle it.
6553000	6554000	No fun allowed.
6554000	6555000	No fun allowed?
6555000	6556000	Come on.
6556000	6557000	All right.
6557000	6559000	But will the Switch app be enabled for it?
6559000	6561000	Because that's how you have to do the headset thing for Splatoon.
6561000	6562000	Yeah, but, you know...
6562000	6564000	It's only if they turn it on.
6564000	6566000	If a tree falls in the woods, does anybody hear it?
6566000	6567000	Like, you know, they could enable it.
6567000	6568000	Nobody's going to use it.
6568000	6570000	Do people use it on Splatoon?
6570000	6572000	I have never used that app for anything.
6572000	6574000	Ryan and I tried to last night, but it was just...
6574000	6576000	We found out that you have to actually create a private room.
6576000	6578000	You can't just do the join a friend thing.
6578000	6581000	So you have to, like, do a lot of preparation in order to actually use the voice chat.
6581000	6582000	I'm...
6582000	6583000	I can see my brain.
6583000	6585000	I just rolled my eyes so fucking hard.
6585000	6586000	Like...
6586000	6588000	Just delete it.
6588000	6592000	No, don't delete it because you can still get equipment using the Splatoon app.
6592000	6594000	But you just don't use it for chat.
6594000	6596000	Delete your account.
6598000	6599000	All right.
6599000	6600000	Moving on.
6600000	6603000	Pokemon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon.
6603000	6607000	Ultra Moon are games I'm sure you're looking forward to, all you Pokey people out there.
6607000	6609000	Which is a lot of you because these games are huge.
6609000	6618000	It has been confirmed this week that Pokemon Ultra Sun and Moon are the last core title games for the 3DS.
6618000	6621000	Of course, we know that Pokemon will be coming out on the Switch.
6621000	6625000	They made that announcement that there will be a core game in the Pokemon universe on the Switch.
6625000	6631000	I'm assuming next year, but that is still an assumption until Nintendo and the Pokemon company confirm that.
6631000	6639000	But Ultra Sun and Moon will be the last core title for the 3DS because it is pushing the, quote, absolute limits of the system.
6639000	6643000	That's coming from Game Freak director Shigeru Omori.
6643000	6649000	That, I guess, the 3DS system was completely redesigned when Sun and Moon was being developed.
6649000	6653000	And they pushed that new system even further to what we thought was the most we could draw from it.
6653000	6659000	With Ultra Sun and Moon, we've tried to take that out more and really, really push the system to its absolute limits.
6659000	6663000	We're now feeling that perhaps this is the maximum of what we can get out.
6663000	6667000	So maybe, now Nintendo will let the 3DS fucking die.
6667000	6671000	Are Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon new 3DS exclusives, or do they still work on the old one?
6671000	6674000	As far as I know, they still work on the old one.
6674000	6678000	Because Nintendo could still get a lot of mileage out of making new 3DS exclusive titles.
6678000	6683000	Like, the backwards compatibility is a problem, but the hardware issue...
6683000	6688000	I don't think that would be a wise move when the Switch is also out there trying to sell stuff.
6688000	6693000	I think they need to make a game for what people have and try to sell Switches for next year's game.
6693000	6696000	Sure, but we also thought the 3DS would stop getting new games when the Switch came out.
6696000	6701000	Fair point, fair point. And now here we go with this Pokémon game this year and Metroid.
6701000	6707000	But like I said, now if Pokémon is officially done on the 3DS, now maybe the 3DS can finally fucking die.
6707000	6710000	I just don't understand why they couldn't put them out on both platforms.
6710000	6713000	Why can't they put the Metroid game out on the Switch?
6713000	6717000	That's a great question. Maybe it will later, who knows?
6717000	6719000	On Virtual Console.
6722000	6726000	Alright, there you go. So that is it for Rapid Fire News.
6726000	6729000	Let's travel around and check out what's in stores this week.
6729000	6730000	Loki, let's start with the US.
6730000	6734000	Quite a bit. So we've got Destiny 2 coming out on PC.
6734000	6737000	Hidden Agenda on PlayStation 4.
6737000	6746000	Just Dance 2018 on PC, the Switch, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, the Wii, and the Wii U.
6746000	6750000	They're still making Wii games. The original Wii.
6750000	6753000	Wait, Just Dance is coming out on the original Wii?
6753000	6754000	The original Wii.
6754000	6761000	Well, there's probably houses like yours that only had a Wii for the longest time and still never upgraded.
6761000	6765000	It just better not have any DLC because in a couple months you can't even do it.
6765000	6769000	I think everything is app-based now or something like that, isn't it?
6769000	6773000	Yeah, but what they did with the Wii previously is any indication.
6773000	6778000	They're just going to kill all the internet usage for it because a lot of the Wii channels don't work anymore.
6780000	6782000	Rest in peace. Rest in Wii.
6783000	6784000	Alright, traveling over to...
6784000	6785000	Oh, hold on.
6785000	6786000	Oh, I thought we were done.
6786000	6788000	No. Oh, we have a ton. I'm sorry.
6789000	6794000	Knights of Azure 2, Bride of the New Moon on PC, the Switch, and PlayStation 4.
6794000	6797000	This is the police for the Switch.
6798000	6799000	Okay.
6799000	6804000	Yomawari Midnight Shadows on PC, PlayStation 4, and the Vita.
6805000	6809000	Coloons Gate VR Suzaku on PlayStation VR.
6810000	6814000	We have Taiko Drum Master Drum Sessions on PlayStation 4.
6815000	6819000	Assassin's Creed Origins on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
6820000	6822000	Super Mario Odyssey on the Switch.
6823000	6828000	Wolfenstein 2 The New Colossus on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
6829000	6830000	That's it.
6830000	6831000	Are you sure? You're done?
6831000	6832000	I'm done.
6832000	6833000	You're done. Alright.
6833000	6835000	Traveling over to Japan. It's a busy week over there as well.
6835000	6838000	Taiko no Tatsujin gets its release over there as well.
6838000	6843000	It's Taiko-ton Tatsujin Session de Dodon Gagdon comes out this week.
6843000	6850000	There's a regular edition of that and you can get some different versions with titles and I think a controller for that as well.
6850000	6852000	You can also check out in Japan this week.
6852000	6855000	Ark Survival Evolved gets its Japanese release this week.
6856000	6864000	Amikata wa Kanojo Narimi comes out this week, which I am not sure what this game is.
6864000	6869000	It looks like it's another one of those sim games featuring anime babes.
6869000	6871000	That's what it just kind of looks like for the screenshots I'm looking at.
6871000	6874000	It's probably a... what do they call those? I don't know.
6874000	6880000	Then we also have a game called Sengo Muramasa DX Guren no Ketu comes out this week as well.
6880000	6888000	And this is a game that looks like it's probably a little more strategy based because I can see the battlefield here with the hexagon shapes and so forth.
6888000	6891000	But with anime cutscenes. So there's that as well.
6891000	6898000	And then if you are so inclined you can also get a new gaming monitor of sorts that's coming off the Playstation 4.
6898000	6901000	But that's a HORI release. That's not an official Sony release.
6901000	6905000	Otherwise, one more set here.
6905000	6915000	Yahari Game Ore no Seishun Love Kome wa Mashigateru and Zoku Omitome set.
6915000	6920000	I think that is some type of like learn to speak type of thing is coming out there.
6920000	6922000	So that is also available in Japan.
6924000	6926000	Let's see, checking other systems here.
6926000	6929000	Including the Vita, which yes, still gets releases.
6929000	6933000	Including price reductions on games like Sword Art Online and Shin Gundamusou.
6933000	6938000	Also we have Steam Prison Nanatsu no Bitoku coming out this week.
6938000	6943000	And that Sengo Muramasa DX game is out on the Vita as well.
6943000	6948000	And I just closed my site so I missed if there was anything on the Nintendo Switch.
6948000	6952000	But I'm going to look right now and I want to look at the 3DS as well.
6952000	6956000	On the Nintendo Switch this week in Japan we also have Super Mario Odyssey of course.
6956000	6957000	They've got to get that game as well.
6957000	6960000	And that is the big release on the Switch this week.
6960000	6962000	Probably meaning there's nothing on the 3DS this week.
6962000	6964000	Oh no I lied, there is an idle game.
6964000	6968000	Idle Time Priipada Yume All-Star is out this week.
6968000	6973000	As is Rune Factory 4 Platinum Collection is out on the 3DS this week.
6973000	6974000	Busy week!
6974000	6977000	Was anybody able to pull UK releases?
6977000	6978000	I know you were trying to hunt around for them JD.
6978000	6981000	But did you, Loki you have them by chance?
6981000	6982000	Yeah I can do it real quick.
6982000	6983000	Awesome.
6983000	6985000	We don't want to neglect our friends over there just because Jamie's gone.
6986000	6987000	Okay I guess we can.
6988000	6995000	So starting off this week we've got, let's see, Bury My Love on iOS.
6995000	6999000	Just Dance 2018 on everything as before.
6999000	7002000	Knights of Azure 2, Bride of the New Moon.
7002000	7007000	And Sword Art Online, Hollow Realization Deluxe.
7007000	7013000	Wolfenstein 2 the New Colossus on Playstation 4 and PC and Xbox One.
7013000	7019000	And that's just it.
7019000	7023000	It looks like, I don't know why they have Just Dance 2017 listed on here as well.
7023000	7024000	That is not correct.
7024000	7026000	That came out last year.
7026000	7028000	Maybe he gets a big price reduction, who knows.
7028000	7031000	Yeah so I'm not gonna, I'm gonna ignore all these other ones here.
7031000	7032000	Fair enough.
7032000	7033000	Alright let's go to the mailbag.
7041000	7042000	You send us emails.
7042000	7043000	Oh I'm sorry there's one more.
7043000	7045000	God damn it Loki.
7045000	7047000	SingStar Celebration on Playstation 4.
7047000	7048000	It's important.
7048000	7049000	Wait there's a new SingStar game?
7049000	7050000	Apparently.
7050000	7051000	Ooh.
7051000	7052000	That's weird.
7052000	7053000	Alright well.
7053000	7055000	They stopped doing them in the US, they do them in Europe because that's where their
7055000	7056000	audience is.
7056000	7057000	I know that's where people actually buy them.
7057000	7058000	Yeah.
7058000	7059000	I like SingStar.
7059000	7064000	One of my friends still does every year for Halloween, pumpkin carving and SingStar.
7064000	7069000	But since they've basically killed off SingStar support in the US it's gotten more and more
7069000	7070000	sad.
7070000	7071000	Oh can you not even download SingStar stuff anymore?
7071000	7077000	He can but well for one he has a PS3 and not a PS4 and there's some differences in licensing
7077000	7078000	and it's really weird.
7078000	7082000	But it's also like the, they've removed a lot of the licenses in the past year.
7082000	7086000	I guess the contract expired because you know how songs are in music games.
7086000	7089000	And they are really really slow at releasing new stuff.
7089000	7092000	And a lot of stuff was only available in Europe anyway.
7092000	7097000	Like there was like an erasure song, like the robot unicorn attack song.
7097000	7098000	Always.
7098000	7100000	It was only available in Europe anyway.
7100000	7101000	So it's very sad.
7101000	7106000	I'll have my, I'll have my SingStar ABBA and you can take that from my cold dead hands.
7106000	7108000	Well it's on a disc so it's gonna work forever.
7108000	7109000	Work forever.
7109000	7110000	You're damn right.
7110000	7111000	We'll put that on the TV somewhere.
7111000	7113000	Alright let's get to the emails.
7113000	7116000	Participate at orangelandrater.com is the place to send us an email.
7116000	7121000	If you would like us to read your email just like I'm going to tonight for three emails.
7121000	7122000	It's a busy week.
7122000	7123000	Three emails.
7123000	7128000	First one tonight from Martin the Belgian who emails us tonight and says hello OLR.
7128000	7131000	I wanted to chime in on your discussion regarding loot boxes.
7131000	7138000	The root of the discussion is really that game publishers want more money out of you than the $60 you paid for a full game.
7138000	7140000	Take EA and Battlefront.
7140000	7146000	Battlefront 1 had only five maps and the rest was behind a season pass paywall that was another $50.
7146000	7148000	There were no paid loot boxes.
7148000	7151000	The community was outraged because of the lack of maps in a full price game.
7151000	7156000	EA was proud to announce that Battlefront 2 has more maps and no season pass.
7156000	7162000	Now however they've put some in game progression and boost items inside of loot boxes you can buy with real money.
7162000	7166000	You can earn them in game but this takes so long that you'll eventually want to buy them.
7166000	7167000	It's now a pay to win game.
7167000	7171000	In both cases they just want more money out of the average player than $60.
7171000	7173000	Is this justified?
7173000	7174000	Let us be honest.
7174000	7178000	The price of game development has gone up but the price of games has hardly gone up in decades.
7178000	7181000	I already paid $50 for games in the late 90s.
7181000	7186000	Personally I'd rather pay $80 for a full game without season pass and without loot boxes.
7186000	7189000	I just hate getting half a game for $60.
7189000	7190000	What do you guys think?
7190000	7193000	Should the price of games just go up?
7193000	7195000	Controversy.
7195000	7196000	Good question.
7196000	7200000	I mean we've obviously talked a little bit about this already tonight.
7200000	7203000	But I think Martin asks a very simple question.
7203000	7207000	Would you be willing to just pay more money for a game if it means no more of this bullshit?
7207000	7210000	No because they're still going to do this bullshit.
7210000	7215000	You may think that doing a certain thing is going to cause them to not do something.
7215000	7216000	That's not the case at all.
7216000	7218000	It never works that way.
7218000	7219000	Never.
7219000	7222000	You allow them to do something like raise the price of a game.
7222000	7224000	Everybody's going to do that now.
7224000	7227000	And they're still going to have this bullshit because it's never going to be enough.
7228000	7230000	I'm a little torn.
7230000	7236000	I'm open to the idea but I don't want $80 to be the fucking standard.
7236000	7243000	$80 needs to be for a gold, no a fucking platinum fucking video game.
7243000	7244000	But that's the problem though.
7244000	7253000	These platinum quote unquote video games have like pre-order DLC that was supposed to be in the game in the first place.
7253000	7255000	And so they're already doing that.
7255000	7261000	They're already piecing out a full game for $80 so you get the full experience because you want the full experience.
7261000	7264000	So am I correct in hearing you say it doesn't matter they're already $80?
7264000	7265000	They are already doing it.
7265000	7269000	They're just doing it with clever marketing like the gold edition or stuff like that where you can buy a season.
7269000	7270000	I mean look at this.
7270000	7272000	That's season pass.
7272000	7273000	Think of how ridiculous it is.
7273000	7277000	You're pre-ordering DLC that's coming out.
7277000	7281000	You're giving them money before the download content is available.
7283000	7291000	I gave, you may not like this, I gave Activision $60 this week because I pre-purchased Destiny 2.
7291000	7294000	So I have it installed and on my machine ready to go on Tuesday.
7294000	7295000	Well that's fine though.
7295000	7297000	The game is already developed.
7297000	7301000	I'm talking about like pre-ordering content that they haven't even made yet.
7301000	7303000	Like the Zelda season pass?
7303000	7305000	Yes any season pass.
7305000	7312000	Well I mean so to be fair if you activate the season pass in Breath of the Wild it actually does give you a couple of small things but it's just like a t-shirt.
7312000	7318000	That's nice but like I think any season pass you know it's kind of lame because just purchase it when it comes out.
7319000	7322000	Here's the thing too I think that's something serious to consider.
7322000	7326000	You know Martin talking about should we just make the sticker price 80 bucks.
7326000	7332000	It's going to get harder and harder to do shit like that when you have a game like Stardew Valley that's 15 bucks.
7332000	7338000	And there's some really big experiences that are awesome gaming experiences that you can get for 20 bucks.
7338000	7346000	Now granted I realize that a game like Stardew Valley especially the development is very very different than a game like I don't know Battlefront 2 or whatever.
7346000	7352000	But that's you know again where I go back and I said earlier make more something about like PUBG.
7352000	7355000	You know perfect example that's a 40 dollar game.
7355000	7358000	You know granted they have loot boxes in there.
7358000	7362000	I don't like it but it seems like it's more accessories and stuff like that.
7362000	7371000	You know it's only costume DLC type stuff which a lot of people try to like put that out there is like okay that's all it is it's just you know cosmetic.
7371000	7374000	But then they kind of it starts getting into other things.
7374000	7377000	But right now it's only cosmetic as far as I'm aware.
7377000	7385000	So that's a game that's offering experience that people want for less than 60 dollars.
7385000	7386000	So it can be done.
7386000	7392000	It's just that they don't want to they want to push the graphics because it's the most gorgeous looking game ever.
7392000	7397000	But would you rather have a really gorgeous looking game or game that's really good to play.
7398000	7408000	Wasn't the whole objection people had to loot boxes is that it was basically gambling and people would spend a lot more than they would if they just you know like that's the whole thing it's hidden costs.
7408000	7416000	So I mean it seems like a fair thing to say okay well we'll just bundle all of this in at a higher price like the game publisher is going to take a hit because they're not getting the gambling income.
7416000	7420000	But like players can be like well I'm just going to plunk it all down at once.
7420000	7425000	Yeah I mean I like knowing what I'm going to get better than fucking gambling.
7425000	7432000	Basically I'd rather have DLC microtransactions where I know what I'm getting versus you know this loot box crap.
7432000	7436000	And then on top of the loot box stuff they do all this like alternate currency stuff.
7436000	7449000	So oh I want that loot box but it's you know 800 of the micro credits or whatever but I can only purchase a pack of 750 or you know a one that's you know 15 dollars or something like that for something like that.
7449000	7455000	It's like they do that shit on purpose because they want you to buy it and oh crap I have this stuff left over.
7455000	7463000	Well I guess I better buy some more. It's all fucking manipulative bullshit and it's all done on purpose.
7463000	7475000	Mega Man X400 in our chat says the loot boxes in Pugbee as I say I know it's PUBG but I like Pugbee are cosmetic but some of the cosmetic items are advantageous like camouflage clothing.
7475000	7481000	So that's kind of where that game is at just if you were curious. Anyway Martin closes the email with this.
7481000	7489000	Finally I don't mind purely cosmetic loot boxes and I don't mind season passes as long as the base game has plenty of content.
7489000	7494000	Thanks as always and keep up the great show Martin the Belgian. Thanks for email Martin.
7494000	7501000	Like I think loot boxes are fine in the sense of like you know like an Overwatch or something like that where you kind of get it as a reward for playing the game.
7501000	7508000	I like Heroes of the Storm a lot too and Heroes of the Storm there's a lot you can buy but Heroes of the Storm is fucking free. It's also a free game.
7508000	7517000	So I mean you expect to get the more nickel and diming stuff and the whole the hot dogs of the price of the currency don't match the buns that cost loot boxes.
7517000	7518000	Yeah no it does.
7519000	7528000	But in a free game there's a lot more leeway for that because I have yet to spend a dollar on Heroes of the Storm and I've had a pretty decent experience so far.
7528000	7535000	And I'm tempted to drop money in it just so I can unlock Ana and Junkrat some of the heroes I want to play and well kind of support it too.
7535000	7541000	I mean I haven't really spent any money on heroes and I've played that's fine because that game didn't require you to pay $60.
7541000	7542000	No it didn't.
7542000	7560000	As you know your ticket to get in so I'm fine with that it's just one year you're requesting me to put down $60 and another $30 for the gold edition and then you want me to buy the Seize the Path for $50 and then oh then you want some microtransactions and loot boxes in game.
7560000	7563000	Come on that's ridiculous.
7564000	7572000	Alright let's get to our next email from Ryan who emails us saying hey OLR love the show keep it up we will thank you.
7572000	7578000	Just wondering what website do you guys use for the upcoming US releases thanks and stay awesome.
7578000	7587000	You know it's a funny story because back when the show first started Loki was working in the distribution industry and so he would just use the fucking source.
7587000	7589000	I would just be off memory.
7589000	7590000	Yeah right.
7590000	7594000	But what do you use now you're using wiki Wikipedia and that's not all that great.
7594000	7598000	I used to use GameStop because they used to have a nice where you could sort by release date.
7598000	7601000	They don't have that anymore because their site's fucking shit.
7601000	7604000	So you use like wiki's 20s gaming.
7604000	7607000	I use Wikipedia but it works entirely accurate.
7607000	7615000	I've seen you kind of throw other stuff into like you're using Wikipedia but you read over here something else you kind of throw that into.
7616000	7619000	Yeah they don't have everything because it's you know it's updated by individuals.
7619000	7621000	They don't have all the indie stuff always right.
7621000	7623000	You're never going to catch everything.
7623000	7625000	Fuck who's going to keep track of all the indies are coming out.
7625000	7628000	I mean it's dark to see you suggesting game facts.
7628000	7630000	I thought game facts had a section for release date.
7630000	7632000	Maybe I haven't checked it in a while.
7632000	7637000	Maybe one more email from Ziba who emails us tonight.
7637000	7642000	Hey guys sorry for the long email but I have a couple of things I wanted to talk about.
7642000	7643000	Hey no problem.
7643000	7648000	Last week when you guys announced that the classic game of the week was Terranigma it really wanted me.
7648000	7653000	It really made me want to tell you a little story about how I first heard about the game.
7653000	7661000	One day back in the early 2000s I was searching for information about emulating games and I came across a website called fantasyanime.com.
7661000	7665000	This site is still around today but back then it was a very small yet informative.
7665000	7669000	It showed information about a handful of the popular animes and RPGs.
7669000	7672000	One of the RPGs was obviously Terranigma.
7672000	7677000	As I read up on the game I quickly got interested in and wanted to try it out.
7677000	7680000	Now emulation wasn't that great back then.
7680000	7686000	One emulator took up a lot of RAM while another one ran fine but couldn't emulate all of the effects and lighting.
7686000	7689000	I became very frustrated that I couldn't fully experience the game.
7689000	7694000	Since I knew Terranigma never came out in the US I was determined to find another way to play it.
7694000	7700000	Upon researching more I found a site that showed how to mod American Super Nintendo consoles to play PAL European games.
7700000	7705000	The vast diagrams and information was very hard for me to understand and I knew I couldn't do it myself.
7705000	7710000	I found out that the owner of the website took orders to actually mod consoles.
7710000	7716000	So after I got permission from my mom I contacted the owner and sent out my Super Nintendo.
7716000	7720000	When my Super Nintendo came back it had two large metal switches on the side.
7720000	7724000	One switched from NTSC to PAL and the other switch disabled the region check.
7724000	7729000	I was very lucky to then purchase a boxed European Terranigma game with a manual on eBay.
7729000	7734000	The game played perfectly. I was so happy to finally experience the game with all the effects and lighting.
7734000	7737000	I played a lot of it but sadly never finished the game.
7737000	7744000	You would think since I went through all the trouble I would finish the game but I had and still have very bad gamer ADD.
7744000	7748000	I still have my own modded Super Nintendo and Terranigma game cartridge.
7748000	7752000	It still works and I plan to play the full game hopefully soon.
7752000	7757000	I like that story though. You set your eyes on something and you said I am doing this.
7757000	7765000	So you know what, it's okay that you didn't finish but I also have the exact same problem you do where I drop a ton of money on games and then I don't always finish them.
7765000	7769000	Another thing you guys mentioned last week was Jersey Jack.
7769000	7771000	This pinball company is very local to me.
7771000	7776000	During this past summer I was able to play all three of their machines at a local pinball arcade.
7776000	7780000	The Wizard of Oz, The Hobbit, and the one that Jamie couldn't remember, Dialed In.
7780000	7787000	Dialed In was very interesting. It brings a lot of modern technology in its gameplay which you do not normally see in the other pinball machines.
7787000	7792000	One of the cool features is that you can connect to the machine using Bluetooth using your phone.
7792000	7795000	This wasn't working at the time but I talked to the owner about it.
7795000	7800000	He said that once you connect you can control the flippers of the machine to mess with the player. What?
7800000	7805000	It sounds very interesting. Another nice feature is that it has volume control on the side.
7805000	7807000	You can actually turn up the volume to hear it better.
7807000	7811000	I think all pinball and arcade machines should have this option because arcades are loud.
7811000	7817000	Also during gameplay the machine vibrates like how video game controls do giving an extra feel to the play.
7817000	7820000	Their Hobbit machine also has this feature.
7820000	7825000	Lastly the game gives you a QR code at the end if you play it so that you can tweet your score.
7825000	7827000	I hope to go back soon to play it again.
7827000	7830000	I'm sad that I won't see you guys at MAGFest in January.
7830000	7836000	Even though a lot of people had trouble getting a hotel room, my boyfriend was lucky to grab one at the convention center.
7836000	7839000	I'm really looking forward to this one. It will be my third year.
7839000	7842000	My goals for this one is to see more bands perform.
7842000	7845000	Anyway, till next time, stay black, Ziba.
7845000	7848000	Thank you for the email Ziba. I really appreciate that.
7848000	7851000	Some good stories in there. That's cool about that dialed in.
7851000	7854000	I have not seen that machine and I will pass that along to Jamie.
7854000	7858000	I know she left early tonight but I'll make sure she reads about that because I think she'd get a kick out of that too.
7858000	7862000	Apparently GameFAQs does have a pretty nice release listing available to use that.
7862000	7866000	Well there you go. That email may have changed the course of the show.
7866000	7869000	Anyway, but I do want to say quickly about MAGFest.
7869000	7872000	I did hear about the hotel room drama this week.
7872000	7877000	And to be honest, I'm not trying to be shady because I really, really enjoyed MAGFest the years I went.
7877000	7879000	I really did. I do want to go again.
7879000	7883000	Obviously with everything I went through over the summer, it wasn't in the cards to happen.
7883000	7887000	And to be fair, with all the other stress I had this week,
7887000	7892000	if I had walked out of that not getting a hotel room for MAGFest on top of that,
7892000	7894000	that would have just fucking broke me.
7894000	7898000	So like, I'm really happy I sat this year out.
7898000	7904000	Although I will sorely miss all of the fine folks that I see at that convention every year.
7904000	7907000	It's okay Rob. You'll just have to make sure you go to MAG West too whenever they announce it.
7907000	7909000	Well you know, I'm open to that.
7909000	7912000	I know I sat out the first year because...
7912000	7913000	Why did I sit out?
7913000	7916000	Because it was the summer and it was a problem time.
7916000	7918000	Oh god, yeah, because that was after. Oh yeah.
7918000	7920000	That was like the week after or something.
7920000	7922000	Yeah, because at first I was like, well maybe...
7922000	7925000	Because I didn't really have a lot of time off already and I was like,
7925000	7929000	I knew that DragonCon was the next week and that was the other problem.
7929000	7934000	So I was like, well maybe I'll drive in for the Saturday and I'll go for a day.
7934000	7938000	And then the other stuff happened and it was like, nope, I'm not going at all.
7938000	7939000	So yeah.
7939000	7940000	It was a good time though.
7940000	7943000	And it's a lot closer than DC.
7943000	7946000	It is, but it's not the same people. No offense.
7946000	7947000	I mean, I love my West Coast people.
7947000	7949000	Well, we need to get them to go too.
7949000	7951000	See, they need to come out here for this one, yeah.
7951000	7956000	I do think though, MAG Fest has probably outgrown National Harbor.
7956000	7960000	And I know they keep saying, we're not moving it. We're under a contract.
7960000	7965000	I think, guys, you need to listen to the feedback you're getting.
7965000	7969000	And a lot of people are telling you, you need to move MAG Fest.
7969000	7971000	Are there bigger venues?
7971000	7972000	What's that?
7972000	7973000	Are there bigger venues in the area?
7973000	7975000	Sure, it's Washington, D.C. for fuck's sake.
7975000	7977000	I don't know a lot about the convention space.
7977000	7981000	Well, if they can do government conventions out there, they can do a gaming convention.
7981000	7984000	I'm sure there's a lot of concerns about 24-hour availability.
7984000	7985000	I know that's the big one.
7985000	7988000	When you do things at hotels, like DragonCon and stuff,
7988000	7993000	you can do things around the clock a lot more easily than an official convention center is not going to let you do that.
7993000	7998000	I hope they can find a happy medium somewhere because National...
7998000	8002000	Well, I mean, the thing with National Harbor, too, is that it's super isolated.
8002000	8006000	Maybe they could find a hotel cluster in downtown D.C. that isn't so isolated.
8006000	8010000	So it's like the Santa Clara Convention Center where there's literally nothing in walking distance.
8010000	8017000	Kind of, but it's just different because on the East Coast with the Potomac's running through there, right?
8017000	8023000	So imagine National Harbor is kind of like, I want to say an island, but it dips out into the Potomac.
8023000	8027000	And so it's like a little, like it's a peninsula of sorts.
8027000	8030000	So there's kind of only a couple of ways in and out.
8030000	8032000	Is it cut off by a freeway or something?
8032000	8035000	Yeah, there's a freeway and there's a lot of residential stuff around it.
8035000	8040000	I mean, Alexandria isn't that far, but it's like there's, you know, when you're going to a 24-hour game convention,
8040000	8044000	you don't want to like at 4 a.m. be like, oh, I got to take my 20-minute ride back to Alexandria.
8044000	8046000	So they have a lot of stuff they need to consider.
8046000	8051000	I know there's a lot of people that are like, but the joy of MAGFest or the vibes are going to be gone.
8051000	8057000	Well, my understanding is this is why MAGFest has MagLabs and all this other stuff that they do,
8057000	8063000	is to capture that spirit or whatever they said of the original MAGFest, whatever they want to call it.
8063000	8072000	So let's see. Yeah, Bobby Blackwolf says the hotel they're at is where they do government conventions.
8072000	8077000	I mean, CPAC is there. Yeah, I do remember like the week after MAGFest.
8077000	8080000	It's really depressing to think of CPAC as government.
8080000	8084000	Yeah, I know. But it's, you know, something you would see in DC.
8084000	8085000	Yeah.
8085000	8087000	Things you find in DC for $500, Alex.
8087000	8089000	So not for that much.
8091000	8098000	All right. Anyway, moving on, that was it for the email.
8098000	8103000	So thank you, Ziba. I really appreciate that. And yes, I thought so.
8103000	8105000	There was one more that came in here late.
8105000	8110000	So I'm being nice because I like this person an awful lot that's emailing us.
8110000	8118000	So I want to read this email here one more from MegamanX400, my co-host over on the Reading is Fundamental podcast,
8118000	8123000	which will be back because we had a new episode on Monday on Friday episode.
8123000	8129000	I don't know when we're recording it, but we've got a good like two or three months before All Stars is really on.
8129000	8133000	So we got time. Anyway, let's read this.
8134000	8140000	Hey, OLR crew. Tonight, there was some good discussion and debate regarding publishers, EA and Activision,
8140000	8145000	and the high cost of game budgets and whether or not single-player linear games are profitable.
8145000	8152000	I definitely think that the approach in which companies like EA, Activision, Square Enix go about making these large-scale one-player games
8152000	8156000	doesn't yield them as high of a return as these online multiplayer games do.
8156000	8162000	Destiny, Overwatch, Grand Theft Auto V are games that allow you to keep playing and have no endgame
8162000	8165000	and allow the publisher to milk more money out of gamers.
8165000	8170000	Single-player games don't present as many options in a world of loot boxes to make more money.
8170000	8176000	That being said, the development costs on open-ended games versus linear single-player games are probably comparable
8176000	8179000	due to the amount of time developing the graphics and so forth.
8179000	8186000	My point in all this is developers need to look into other viable methods to create those single-player stories
8186000	8189000	that don't run the millions of dollars in development.
8189000	8194000	In the current state of the gaming market, this is where I feel the Switch has a bit of an advantage right now
8194000	8197000	and is drawing some third parties and indie developers.
8197000	8201000	I know it's been stated before by many, why can't Switch have more power?
8201000	8204000	But it might work in its favor right now.
8204000	8207000	Developers can spend less of a development budget on a Switch game,
8207000	8210000	and even though it may sell less than your blockbuster AAA titles,
8210000	8214000	the profit margin is potential to be higher than those AAA titles.
8214000	8217000	Just wanted to share my thoughts on this discussion that took place tonight.
8217000	8219000	Take care, Mega Man X 400.
8219000	8226000	Well, Square Enix getting on board with the Switch with this project Octopath Traveler, right?
8226000	8231000	And that game definitely doesn't look like it has the graphics of a Final Fantasy XV,
8231000	8234000	but I think has a lot of people excited nonetheless.
8234000	8239000	So I think some devs may be going that direction, actually.
8239000	8241000	Is that a Switch exclusive?
8241000	8243000	As far as I know, I believe it is.
8243000	8246000	I do not believe they've announced it for any other platforms.
8246000	8248000	It's only going to be on Switch.
8248000	8251000	So, interesting.
8251000	8256000	What do you think about that email and this whole, you know,
8256000	8260000	make more games for the Switch, I guess, as one way out of it?
8260000	8265000	Do you think maybe, you know, Loki, I know you're usually very tongue-in-cheek when it comes to Nintendo,
8265000	8270000	do you think maybe our emailer has a point that maybe the Switch has a small advantage here
8270000	8273000	because they're selling two million of them and still going,
8273000	8277000	and they're probably cheaper to make games for than the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One?
8277000	8279000	I don't know if they're cheaper to make games for
8279000	8282000	because those cartridges are more expensive to, you know,
8282000	8286000	press the game onto versus, you know, a CD or DVD.
8286000	8291000	But in the scope of a multi-million dollar budget in creating the game.
8291000	8295000	Well, right, there's no point in creating, you know, these really impressive graphics
8295000	8297000	if you can't display it on the device,
8298000	8303000	like I said before, they don't really have to push the boundaries for graphics in these games.
8303000	8307000	I mean, they feel like that they do sometimes, but I don't think I've ever said,
8307000	8310000	yeah, I'm not gonna buy that game because the graphics aren't good.
8310000	8313000	It's usually, I'm not gonna buy that game because it doesn't look fun.
8313000	8317000	I've never just, well, the added more lens flares and those explosions look better,
8317000	8319000	I would probably buy that game.
8319000	8321000	I'd buy Earth Defense Force, for fuck's sake.
8321000	8325000	Look at that game, that's purely gameplay because the graphics and the physics suck.
8325000	8327000	The graphics suck.
8327000	8331000	On the other hand, have you ever been more motivated to buy a game because the graphics were so good?
8331000	8337000	I mean, and I'll admit, part of the reason I've waited on Destiny 2 for PC
8337000	8340000	is for the, you know, better graphics.
8340000	8343000	The only one that I can think of that, like, I was like,
8343000	8347000	oh man, the graphics look really good are like Rockstar games
8347000	8349000	and I buy those anyways because of the gameplay.
8349000	8351000	But yeah, the graphics look nice too.
8352000	8355000	But I'll buy something specifically for the graphics.
8355000	8359000	So I thought the point he was making was that they don't have to spend as much on labor
8359000	8366000	to develop really complicated graphics if they know they're working with lower capacity, you know, systems.
8366000	8367000	Right.
8367000	8370000	Do you think that, like, the cartridge cost offsets all of that?
8370000	8373000	Because I thought labor was a lot more expensive than the physical production.
8373000	8377000	Well, in the end it's gonna depend on how many copies they can sell
8377000	8381000	and they're gonna look at, you know, how many units are out there of that system
8381000	8384000	versus how many units are out for the other systems and they're gonna develop accordingly.
8384000	8389000	And honestly, more and more is going digital, which is a whole other debate for another day, but that's the reality.
8389000	8392000	On top of that though, you have to also look at companies like EA.
8392000	8395000	It is gonna be more expensive to develop on that platform
8395000	8398000	because they have this stupid Frostbite engine that they want to use for everything
8398000	8400000	and Frostbite doesn't run on that system.
8400000	8406000	So they have to develop a new engine for the lower end hardware that's gonna do something that they want to do.
8406000	8410000	I mean, I guess they could try to recycle something they haven't in the past, but probably not gonna be the case.
8410000	8413000	So you have to look at that as well
8413000	8418000	because it can be an additional cost if they're developing using this one engine on all these other platforms,
8418000	8422000	but this one-off platform requires a completely different engine.
8422000	8424000	That's why they didn't develop a lot against the Wii.
8424000	8426000	Fabulous, fabulous emails tonight.
8426000	8427000	Thank you all so much.
8427000	8433000	Participate at orangelandtrady.com if you would like to have your email considered for our next episode.
8433000	8435000	For the meantime, we gotta move on with just a few.
8435000	8441000	We just have a handful of stories here, and then we're gonna get to our Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
8441000	8443000	But first, Loki.
8443000	8448000	Yes, so celebrating Valve's Orange Box, the 10-year anniversary of that,
8448000	8456000	they released a brand new update for Team Fortress 2 called the Jungle Inferno update,
8456000	8465000	along with that, a wonderful new Valve movie of Saxon Hale that was hilarious.
8465000	8471000	Wait, is this an update on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 even, or just the PC version of Orange Box?
8471000	8474000	I think it's just the PC version. I don't know if they're updating those anymore.
8474000	8478000	I was gonna say, that would be pretty impressive if they went back and updated the old, old title.
8478000	8483000	It would be nice if then it would release a new 10th anniversary edition of Orange Box.
8483000	8485000	Act F confirms just PC.
8486000	8489000	Along with that, of course, they had some new maps.
8489000	8496000	They've got Banana Bay and Brazil, which I guess some of those were made by Valve and some actually by the community.
8496000	8498000	New gear as well.
8498000	8504000	The biggest update, though, comes with Pyro, who gets a jetpack now.
8504000	8510000	They also have a new single-shot flamethrower that looks pretty awesome.
8510000	8514000	So that's kind of a big change, because now the Pyro can actually get across the map pretty fast.
8514000	8520000	Well, that's pretty cool that they're doing some changes to kind of maybe bring some eyes back to the game.
8520000	8527000	I mean, I'm sure, you know, obviously a game like Team Fortress 2 is always gonna have an audience that's out there playing it.
8527000	8532000	But certainly there's a lot of people that are like, ooh, I got a new girl and her name's Overwatch.
8532000	8534000	I'm gonna go play that for a little while, right?
8534000	8535000	Splatoon.
8535000	8538000	Well, and it's a free-to-play game, so you can jump in and check it out anytime.
8538000	8539000	That's true.
8539000	8540000	That's true.
8540000	8543000	And maybe this is a way to kind of bring some of those eyes back.
8543000	8547000	Hey, don't forget about us. We're where it started, yo, ten years ago.
8547000	8552000	Yeah, you can't argue that a lot of inspiration for Overwatch came from Team Fortress 2.
8552000	8553000	Absolutely.
8553000	8554000	All right.
8554000	8561000	And actdeft in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, which, by the way, I forgot to say this earlier because I didn't realize it until somebody messaged me.
8561000	8567000	But I guess the actual web client chat isn't working right tonight.
8567000	8571000	You have to go in through regular IRC, so that's why we have a lot less chatters than we usually do.
8571000	8572000	Is Mibbit down?
8572000	8579000	Yeah, I think something about that whole, or it's connecting to the wrong server or something weird's going on there, so it's just an error for tonight.
8579000	8580000	So sorry, guys.
8580000	8585000	Just so you know, everything does run on the old-ass internet backbone of IRC.
8585000	8588000	Yes, the Internet Relay Chat channel.
8588000	8589000	IRC.
8589000	8591000	Everything runs on the old-ass fucking backbone of IRC.
8592000	8601000	So if you have, like, M-I-R-C or one of those clients, you just go to the Gamesurge Network, which is IRC.gamesurge.net, and we are in channel vog, pound vog.
8601000	8607000	And see, a lot of people today, like, because everything got so integrated with the web and things like Discord, they probably have no idea what I'm talking about.
8607000	8612000	Like, IRC was, like, all we fucking had, like, ten years ago and even further back.
8612000	8617000	So I remember when I was in college, I used to chat on M-I-R-C all the time.
8617000	8618000	Yeah.
8618000	8619000	That was it.
8619000	8620000	We didn't have Discord or Slack.
8620000	8621000	Back in my day!
8621000	8624000	I was in middle school when I first got on IRC.
8624000	8631000	But to be fair, our old asses at vog are finally evolving a little bit, and we do have a Discord as well.
8631000	8634000	Discord's not replacing chat, but it's...
8634000	8639000	I find it's a nice way to keep in touch throughout the week, and it's working a little more effectively than our forums were.
8639000	8645000	Actually, I would say Discord has been way more successful than the forums were, because I think forums are a dying art.
8645000	8647000	Which we'll get into later, by the way.
8647000	8649000	But I'll leave that as a tease.
8649000	8650000	Oh boy.
8650000	8653000	Yeah, I decided.
8653000	8656000	Let's just open that door and see where we go.
8656000	8660000	But anyway, I do want to mention vognetwork.com slash Discord.
8660000	8663000	If you want to hang with us throughout the week, it's a great place to go.
8663000	8671000	And Rama points out you can also go to irc.gamesurge.net slash vog.
8671000	8673000	Rama says, oh, there's an IRC link here.
8673000	8677000	Well, you can't put a link to IRC in IRC, Rama.
8677000	8679000	That's not going to help.
8679000	8684000	But I will consider doing a tweet later or something, just so people know they have a plan B.
8684000	8690000	All right, meanwhile, let's talk about a mini cabinet.
8690000	8696000	Have you ever wanted to own your own arcade cabinet, but thought, boy, these fuckers are expensive.
8696000	8698000	Well, maybe this is something for you.
8698000	8702000	It is what they called, I guess it's Replicade is the name of this.
8702000	8704000	Replicade Cross Centipede.
8704000	8709000	It is a one-sixth scale cabinet replica, and you can play centipede.
8709000	8712000	It is one-sixth of size.
8712000	8718000	So that means it has a three and a half inch LCD monitor that's built into it.
8718000	8722000	And yes, a tiny little trackball that you can use to actually play the game.
8722000	8726000	The cabinet runs on a lithium-ion battery to actually power the whole thing.
8726000	8732000	And they're saying it is lag-free performance through to chipset, which the company New Wave is making.
8732000	8734000	They are going crowdfunding for this.
8734000	8739000	You can back it and pledge $90 if you want one of these in April of 2018.
8739000	8743000	But they are expecting that these cabinets are going to be $160 at retail.
8743000	8747000	So if you want this to be a little cheaper, you want to pay $90 for it today.
8747000	8749000	So again, if you want to check that out.
8749000	8751000	Can you build a bar top for cheaper than that?
8751000	8754000	There's a little Kickstarter if you want to check out that.
8754000	8756000	I think it's a cute idea.
8756000	8762000	You know what's funny? I have those tiny, tiny cabinets that Jamie found at Walmart.
8762000	8765000	And ironically, one of them is centipede.
8765000	8767000	And the other one is Qbert.
8767000	8769000	And that is in this arcade classics thing.
8769000	8770000	And they are tiny.
8770000	8772000	They're probably tinier than this thing is.
8772000	8777000	Because those screens are no bigger than like an inch and a half.
8777000	8779000	Like those screens are tiny.
8779000	8780000	But they're cute.
8780000	8782000	I like them because I like old arcade.
8782000	8783000	And those are only $20.
8783000	8785000	So they're cute little collectibles.
8785000	8788000	But obviously you'll notice they're still in the box.
8788000	8790000	So it's not like I play them all day.
8790000	8792000	You can still play them through the box.
8792000	8795000	Like when it's in the store, there's little cutouts in the plastic.
8795000	8796000	So you can play them in the store.
8796000	8797000	And run down the battery.
8797000	8799000	Yeah, and run down the battery. Exactly.
8799000	8802000	So that's why I haven't taken them out of the box.
8802000	8804000	Because you can still kind of check them out.
8804000	8807000	Replicade again is the name if you want to look for that.
8807000	8812000	I feel like Replicade sounds like a sci-fi series like Androids or somebody.
8812000	8814000	Maybe that's Replicant.
8814000	8816000	Maybe. Maybe.
8817000	8821000	Also, Rama says a good link to get on IRC.
8821000	8822000	You can actually go to his show.
8822000	8827000	AnimeJamSession.com slash VOG Network has all the IRC details.
8827000	8831000	To be fair, I think live.vognetwork.com does have the IRC details.
8831000	8833000	But it's in really tiny text.
8833000	8839000	Because Bobby realizes most people that are going to use IRC already kind of know how to get there.
8840000	8845000	And the web client works for other people that don't really know IRC or don't use it a lot.
8845000	8849000	Which is fine. Again, it's kind of an old art form at this point.
8849000	8851000	So you have to look for the really tiny text.
8851000	8854000	But it will help you get on IRC the old-fashioned way if you need it.
8854000	8859000	As soon as I figured out you guys were using Nivot to do IRC chat, I just googled Game Surge IRC.
8859000	8861000	When I started doing chat.
8861000	8866000	Which, honestly, I don't even know who runs Game Surge or what the Game Surge is.
8866000	8869000	Game Surge dates back to when we were on all games.
8869000	8871000	All games ran through the Game Surge Network.
8871000	8875000	So we were like, well, we don't want people to have to go to another server.
8875000	8876000	We might as well just stay here.
8876000	8879000	And running your own IRC server is a pain in the ass.
8879000	8881000	Oh, yeah. No, I wouldn't run our own.
8881000	8884000	Why would we run our own IRC server when we can use Discord now?
8884000	8887000	Yeah. I have a friend who does that.
8887000	8890000	For some old LiveJournal people.
8890000	8895000	So, speaking of old, outdated relics that people still use.
8895000	8897000	I used to visit this forum every day.
8897000	8900000	No, I know. I can't resist throwing a little shade.
8900000	8903000	Although, this is nothing to be shady about.
8903000	8905000	This is some serious shit that's going down right now.
8905000	8907000	Yes, as with the last few weeks.
8907000	8912000	With everybody coming out about their experience with sexual harassment and everything.
8912000	8915000	Of course, some of it's already hit the game industry.
8915000	8918000	We talked about it last week.
8918000	8920000	There was a site that was responsible.
8920000	8925000	They had some of the owners of that that were caught in some bad situation.
8925000	8931000	Well, now NeoGaf is also receiving some of that.
8931000	8938000	Because apparently the founder of NeoGaf, Tyler Evilore, Malka.
8938000	8943000	Had some sexual harassment claims made against him.
8943000	8950000	Regarding, I guess, an experience he had with some female acquaintance or whatever.
8950000	8953000	In a hotel room at some event or something like that.
8953000	8958000	Once she came out about it, then there was more stories coming out about all the stuff that's happened.
8958000	8961000	So with that, all the mods left.
8961000	8964000	And then finally, he shut the site down.
8964000	8968000	In waiting a statement or something like that.
8968000	8971000	As of right now, it's gone.
8971000	8973000	So that is interesting.
8973000	8977000	Considering the fact that also that their site was trying to push this whole, you know,
8977000	8983000	we're going to try to have the backs of women and try to stop this type of harassment going on in here.
8983000	8987000	That there was this whole kind of dark side the whole time about it.
8987000	8999000	You know, it's been tough this week to hear how many people I know that have been personally affected by things like this.
8999000	9004000	And it's just like one of those like, what a fucking awful world we live in.
9004000	9009000	But at the same time, I'm really happy people are empowered to speak up.
9009000	9013000	So that maybe change will fucking happen this time.
9013000	9021000	And maybe people will take the hint that, I don't know, maybe possibly they could stop raping people.
9021000	9028000	That would be fantastic if everybody could just learn that as like a basic human instinct.
9028000	9033000	As like most people, I think we all kind of know, don't murder somebody.
9033000	9035000	Just don't do it.
9035000	9038000	It's really not a good idea to murder somebody.
9038000	9047000	It would be great if people were wired that same way when it came to things like sexual assault, rape and all those, you know, hideous things.
9047000	9053000	Like you just, you don't do it.
9053000	9055000	I don't know what else to say on it.
9055000	9059000	Like it obviously is an issue that goes way deeper than video games.
9059000	9061000	Our little podcast.
9061000	9062000	Terrible people are everywhere.
9062000	9063000	Yeah, yeah.
9063000	9064000	Well, I guess that's what it boils down to.
9064000	9066000	Terrible people are everywhere.
9066000	9076000	And we have to all put our foot down, all of us, with the women, with all of us need to sit down.
9076000	9080000	All minorities, majorities, everybody has to put their foot down and say, no more.
9080000	9083000	This will not represent our culture anymore.
9083000	9086000	Stop.
9086000	9088000	I don't know what else to say.
9088000	9093000	You know, I think it speaks to the credit of the admins of that site for all stepping down in protest.
9093000	9099000	Like all of the forum administrators in response, like when this came out, like resigned the same day.
9099000	9104000	And that's not always the response that you see this happening when these kinds of things come out.
9104000	9108000	Like, so that, I mean, I think that's at least something.
9108000	9109000	Yeah.
9109000	9112000	You know, instead of just going on as business as usual and we're going to ignore it.
9112000	9117000	Yeah. Or, you know, or turning the victim into she's lying.
9117000	9124000	She's that, you know, and all that, which I'm sure there are people out there that are saying that who need to just, just, just disappear.
9124000	9126000	Just, just disappear.
9126000	9129000	Your services are not needed at this time.
9129000	9131000	Well, they're going to the bad place.
9131000	9134000	Yes, they are going to the bad place.
9134000	9135000	That's a very good way to look.
9135000	9141000	I, everything I do in my life now, I'm going to look in terms of, will this put me in the good place or the bad place?
9141000	9143000	Will Janet be there or not?
9143000	9145000	It'll put you in the medium place.
9145000	9152000	At least that woman gets to masturbate in solitude constantly.
9152000	9155000	Yeah, but her train full of cocaine never arrives.
9155000	9157000	Okay. I'm sorry.
9157000	9159000	Do not turn something like this into something funny.
9159000	9160000	All right.
9160000	9162000	Moving on. Was there more with this?
9162000	9175000	Yes, there is also a story regarding a former employee of Naughty Dog at David Ballard who said that he had been sexually harassed by a superior at that company.
9175000	9181000	Basically saying, in late 2015, I was sexually harassed by, at Naughty Dog by a lead.
9181000	9184000	My work environment became extremely toxic.
9184000	9188000	Afterward, in February 2016, I had a mental breakdown at work.
9188000	9192000	Sony PlayStation HR became involved when I told them about the harassment.
9192000	9195000	They ended the call and fired me the next day.
9195000	9200000	They cited that the company was moving in a different direction and my job was no longer needed.
9200000	9208000	They tried to silence me by offering me $20,000 if I signed a letter agreeing to the termination as well as not to discuss it with anyone.
9208000	9212000	I declined to sign and I've been unemployed for 17 months since.
9212000	9224000	And, of course, Naughty Dog came out and basically said that we've recently read on social media that an ex-employee of Naughty Dog, Dave Ballard, claims he was sexually harassed when he worked at Naughty Dog.
9224000	9234000	We have not found any evidence of having received allegations from Mr. Ballard that he was harassed anyway at Naughty Dog or Sony Interactive Entertainment.
9234000	9239000	Harassment and inappropriate conduct have no place at Naughty Dog or Sony Interactive Entertainment.
9239000	9246000	We have taken and always will take reports of sexual harassment and other workplace grievances very seriously.
9246000	9250000	We value every single person who works at Naughty Dog and Sony Interactive Entertainment.
9250000	9259000	It is of the utmost importance that we maintain safe, productive workplace environments that allow us to channel and share our passion of making games.
9259000	9266000	That was a very vanilla, sterile response to that whole situation.
9266000	9267000	Yeah, so I don't know.
9267000	9270000	It's expected. It's an expected response, unfortunately.
9270000	9273000	Look, it's hard to say, you know, it's he...
9273000	9275000	Didn't he say he went to Sony?
9275000	9276000	Yes.
9276000	9278000	So why does Naughty Dog say we don't have it on our record?
9278000	9281000	Well, I think it was Sony making that comment that they didn't have...
9281000	9283000	See how it's weird?
9283000	9287000	This one sounds really complicated. I read a little about it, but it's hard to make sense of.
9287000	9297000	Here's the bottom line, because, you know, we don't... I mean, this poor guy, whatever happened to him, now everybody's talking about it and people are tweeting him with their own opinions.
9297000	9300000	And again, your services are not needed. Shut up.
9300000	9304000	Like, you know, and I don't want to contribute to that noise.
9304000	9314000	But what I will say is, well, we found out in a big way in these past couple weeks that sexism exists in the movie industry. Is anybody shocked?
9314000	9318000	Well, in the fact that it seems like a lot of them knew about it and just did nothing about it.
9318000	9322000	So is anybody shocked to hear it probably is happening in the game industry, too?
9322000	9323000	Probably.
9323000	9326000	No, I say probably. It is happening in the game industry, too.
9326000	9327000	And other industries.
9327000	9333000	Yeah, and probably, no, definitely, this is happening in every industry.
9333000	9334000	So...
9334000	9341000	It's just because these shitty people are everywhere and they have all these different jobs and that's why you go on the internet and you're gonna run into shitty people.
9341000	9349000	And I'm not saying that makes it okay, but at least something as visible as the movie industry or as visible as the game industry,
9349000	9360000	maybe now, hopefully, change is coming from that level that will roll down into every industry where this shit stops and people are wired to know,
9360000	9368000	gee, I shouldn't sexually harass somebody today. That would not be a good idea and will get me sent to the bad place.
9369000	9374000	Perhaps I should not invite my potential actresses up to my hotel room and ask them to watch me shower.
9374000	9382000	Yeah, that would be a bad idea. Yes, it would. And it would be great if people had the instinct to know that.
9382000	9392000	Well, from what I heard, the inviting up to hotel rooms is a standard thing in the movie industry because they set up their rooms as meeting space.
9392000	9398000	So the, oh, let's go to my hotel room is not the suspicious part. It's the what happens when you get there.
9398000	9408000	And that's a really hard problem to untangle because you don't know that it's gonna be bad until you're already in that situation, which makes it so much worse.
9408000	9419000	I think the thing that really just makes you shake your head and go, ugh, is when that video surfaced of Courtney Love in 2005 saying,
9419000	9427000	and she says, didn't they ask her, they asked her, and I'm paraphrasing here, they asked her something like, do you have any advice for other women in the industry?
9427000	9437000	And she goes, and she said it in a very Courtney Love, I don't give a fuck kind of way. She says, if you ever get invited by Harvey Weinstein to a party at the four rooms, say no.
9437000	9446000	And so now that's coming back in full force now, right? But it goes, the reason why is that this has been around a very long time.
9446000	9452000	If that goes back to 2005, I would bet you there's many actresses that go back to the fucking 1950s, it was probably worse in the 1950s and 40s.
9452000	9472000	And when things were, you know, even a long time ago, like, yeah, well, I mean, they, the only, the only sliver of a good thing maybe we can take from this is that this will be the generation that changes this.
9472000	9482000	Hopefully. Well, I mean, people are feeling empowered to speak up. So we stop making jokes about millennials liking avocado toast and this bullshit, and maybe this will be the generation that changes it.
9486000	9500000	Anyway, let's move on to something else. Shall we? I would say, let's move on to Legos. Legos is a happy subject, right? Something fun, right?
9500000	9507000	I love Legos. Unfortunately, I wish I had better news, but Lego dimensions is not coming back. It's pretty much a sure thing at this point.
9507000	9519000	That's too bad. I mean, cause I thought out of all the like, you know, toys, life things that that did, you know, was the most well done game. The problem with that game though is it's so fucking expensive.
9519000	9531000	It was just because not, not only is it the toys to games tax, but then it's the Lego tax. It's the Lego tax. It's like, Oh, Hey, you want one of those expansions? That's 40 fucking dollars. No, I don't have that kind of money.
9531000	9543000	We were just browsing in like target yesterday. And like, I still wanted that midway arcade set. They still had, it was a 30 bucks. And it was like ridiculous. I'm like, well, no wonder it's shutting down.
9543000	9557000	You know, here's a, here's a quick tip, uh, check some of those Facebook groups, like the marketplace and stuff. People selling their old Lego dimension sets. I found one that was like, it was an Xbox one version, but they had like 30 different expansions for like a hundred dollars.
9557000	9571000	My friend saw a shit ton of the expansion sets at the fucking 99 cent store. Yeah. I wanted to go there and get some cause I like still building them and stuff. Um, and I want the mini fix from them just because some of them are pretty cool. Um, like I'd like to have the portal and that'd be pretty cool.
9571000	9578000	What worries me about buying used Legos is do they actually find all the bricks? Cause I'm like, there's so many little tiny things. It's easy to lose some of them.
9578000	9597000	Usually like, it depends. Like you can go on there's websites like brick link or whatever. You can actually go buy you sets from people and they're in different, um, types of, um, you know, conditions and stuff. And usually they'll state if there's anything missing or if it's complete and you can tell because they have an inventory on in the manual, it shows what it is.
9597000	9620000	Sure. Um, and then the best part about it is if you are missing something, you can order it. And I mean, it's cheap. It's like a few cents. Here's the other thing about Lego dimensions. You don't really need to build a goddamn thing. You don't, you don't have to even open up the bricks. If you don't want to, the only thing you need is that little disc with the chip on it that you build the Lego on top of, because that's where the data really is, is on that.
9620000	9632000	Now, of course, I don't, why, why would you buy a Lego game and not play with the Legos? But to be fair, you technically don't have to even do it. Like you just need that little disc that reads the information. That's all you really need.
9632000	9637000	I'm just imagining Facebook marketplace quality being the same as like random people selling things on Craigslist.
9637000	9638000	It is.
9638000	9639000	You have like, you know, as is.
9639000	9641000	But a lot of the ones I've seen though aren't open.
9641000	9642000	That's good.
9642000	9646000	Like they bought like all this stuff. They go gung ho into it and then they just never played it.
9646000	9647000	Hmm.
9647000	9648000	Like I understand that.
9648000	9660000	Anyhow, we didn't really get around to it, but why is this going around this week? It's because Traveler's Tales, who makes the game, there's a game studio manager, Dave Dootson, I guess wrote something to all the employees that made his way onto the net.
9660000	9673000	And it said, thanks so much to everyone for making Dimensions possible. As difficult as it has been, it is worth celebrating the incredible achievement it represents in the quality of the game, the amazing blend of IPs and the challenging technical demands it presented.
9673000	9680000	It stands as a real testament to the talent within TT. So, I mean, it reads like an obituary, basically.
9680000	9686000	It's too bad. And I really do want to collect some of the other games, but like that stuff has not come down in price frame. Some of them.
9686000	9692000	Like I always, like you were mentioning Target, I've been going to their clearance section and they have had some of the Dimensions stuff in there.
9692000	9696000	But it's the Dimensions stuff I like, I don't want. Like it's like, you know, weird.
9696000	9698000	Yeah, I think we saw something in there.
9698000	9699000	Yeah.
9699000	9700000	Oh, Ninjago was in there, I think.
9700000	9701000	Yeah.
9701000	9707000	Yeah, we looked at the clearance and they had some stuff. Is Traveler's Tale still around? Like, are they closing as a part of that, too?
9707000	9708000	I don't think so.
9708000	9714000	No, they're still around. They're making lots of LEGO games. Like, they've got the LEGO Marvel universe. Or, LEGO Marvel.
9714000	9715000	So they're just ending Super Heroes.
9715000	9716000	Those are one thing.
9716000	9721000	Yeah, those LEGO games still make a lot of money. It's just the toys to life part of it is sunsetting.
9721000	9729000	Yeah, it's just a lot of shelf space and it really was the LEGO part of that. It was just so expensive for those sets.
9729000	9734000	Like, $40 for what amounts to basically a piece of DLC.
9734000	9737000	I'm going to just jump in here real quick and say our Skype line is open.
9737000	9740000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, if you want to give us a call.
9740000	9744000	We'll try to squeeze in a couple calls. We're about to 9 o'clock tonight, but we'll try to squeeze in a couple calls.
9744000	9748000	I'm actually not going to be streaming after the show tonight, either, since I have company in from out of town.
9748000	9757000	After the week I had, I know I haven't been streaming a lot lately, but I kind of want to hit the reset button, so to speak, and try to come back maybe a little later next week.
9757000	9760000	So I'm not going to be streaming tonight, but we are going to open up Skype line right now for some calls.
9760000	9762000	Finish your thought here real quick, Loki, and then we'll get to the calls.
9762000	9768000	Yeah, it was just expensive. I wanted to get some of that stuff, but anything LEGO is just really ridiculously expensive.
9768000	9772000	Yeah, it really is. It's paying that extra tax on top of everything else.
9772000	9778000	All right, but we are going to try to go to the phones here and take a call. I think we do have something coming in right now.
9778000	9782000	Let's get to it. Whoa, it's still, it hung up. It missed.
9782000	9788000	It's the one thing I don't like about using this iPad right now is that, like, I'll try to bring the, I'll try to remember next week.
9788000	9801000	I still have to wipe that thing. No, well, it's fine because I don't, Loki is going to be bringing a laptop to the show, but we don't know if it's actually going to work or what the deal is going to be on this as of yet.
9801000	9813000	So we'll see. He's bringing it as, like, a test to see if we can do it. But right now, man, I hit the button to answer the call, and the iPad is still thinking, still thinking, and hopefully it's picking up.
9813000	9824000	Or this is just a feature, if you will, of our internet right now. Okay, I tried to take that call and it didn't go through. Let me try one more time and see if it'll connect.
9824000	9826000	It just works.
9826000	9836000	I know, right? Maybe this is tied to the reason our thing keeps, uh, no, it keeps ending. As soon as I pick it up, it's, like, immediately the call ends.
9836000	9838000	Is something popping up on the monitor?
9838000	9846000	It is. Okay, so, wait, are the calls coming, oh my god, are the calls coming in on the PC finally?
9846000	9852000	This may actually not be the end of the world. Let's see what happens.
9853000	9860000	Okay, let's try it. Live radio and the joys of it, boys and girls. Let's try going to the phones. Hi, you're on Orange House Radio, who's this?
9860000	9863000	This is just proof that the concept actually works.
9863000	9874000	Okay, so, I want you all to hear a fun story. So, Skype, been broken on the PC for the last, how many weeks, three, four weeks, right?
9874000	9881000	So I've been using my iPad to work around it, right? So here I am on my iPad, JD points out tonight, what's that popping up on your monitor?
9881000	9889000	So, Skype works tonight, on the computer, like it did a month ago, just out of the blue.
9889000	9890000	Look.
9890000	9893000	You know what I changed, Rama? Not a goddamn thing.
9893000	9895000	Rama.
9895000	9900000	Sunspots. It's sunspots, yes. Is it a full moon?
9900000	9902000	Something.
9902000	9908000	So, DJ, Rama, what would you like to call, what would you like to talk to us about tonight on your call?
9909000	9913000	A few things, I'll get, I'll make these as brief as possible so that other people can call in.
9913000	9916000	But as for the issue with Skype, yeah, we've had our own issues.
9916000	9923000	Marco has had to reboot a couple of times just to get into the, into the Skype call with us.
9923000	9928000	So, we're like, okay, if this, if this shit keeps up, we're going to go to Discord.
9928000	9932000	I'm the jury rig, Skype and Discord make this shit work, one way or another.
9932000	9937000	Because evidently, Skype works for me, but for her, it's like, no.
9937000	9942000	Yeah, more and more people are starting to podcast through Discord, I'm finding, which is interesting.
9942000	9947000	But I tell you what, Discord is great for audio. Video, not so much.
9947000	9953000	I have my little tablet, I'm with a friend, we go into Discord video, it crashed my little tablet.
9953000	9958000	Meanwhile, I can do Skype video on my tablet. Works great. No problems.
9958000	9961000	Yeah, video is still new for Discord, so I'll give him that.
9961000	9965000	And Discord, like, does a lot for free, so I'll give him a pass.
9965000	9969000	But yeah, maybe not the number one option for video right now.
9969000	9971000	Yeah, definitely.
9971000	9977000	But, yeah, I'm seeing Facebook last week, everybody's coming out about the harassment issues.
9977000	9982000	And let me tell you, one person in the community around here said,
9982000	9989000	I believe you got dragged harder than anybody I have ever seen because this person is known for some stuff.
9989000	9991000	And I'm just going to leave it at that.
9991000	9998000	And I just hope that this person realizes, after what he said, and the backlash he got for it,
9998000	10002000	he realizes how much in the wrong he is, and he does make amends to be a better person.
10004000	10011000	Well, let's just all hope everyone decides to be better people, but change needs to happen. I think that's evident.
10011000	10015000	Because even I made posts about my transgressions and how I'm going to be a better person.
10015000	10017000	Good for you, man.
10017000	10025000	And the last thing is, this whole Magfest, Inner Harbor, DC bullshit.
10025000	10033000	Man, listen, I had a conversation with one of the staffers about Magfest at Comic Con during dinner with a friend.
10033000	10037000	I almost jumped across the table with his bullshit excuses.
10037000	10041000	We can chat later about that, but I will say this.
10041000	10045000	It takes me about four hours to get to DC.
10045000	10058000	I've got to spend an extra half hour either through a bus that runs every hour from Metro Station to whatever the hotel is,
10058000	10062000	or wait around and try to get an Uber or a Lyft over there.
10062000	10069000	And yes, to be perfectly honest, with the numbers that Magfest is getting, it doesn't seem to be that crowded.
10069000	10075000	But I will say this, if they ever have to move, they can just move to the Reagan Convention Center right there in DC,
10075000	10083000	because there is a hotel right across the street with an underground walkway path, and there's like five hotels within a two-block radius.
10083000	10091000	But the big problem with moving to an established convention center like that, it's very hard to run a 24-hour con in those places sometimes.
10091000	10092000	True.
10092000	10095000	And I think a lot of people would be very upset if Magfest wasn't 24 hours.
10095000	10102000	Yeah, and I get that. It kind of goes back to the first time I went to Fandame and me and Drunami.
10102000	10112000	We got up at like 3.45 in the morning. No, actually, I think I got up at like 3 o'clock in the morning and dragged him along to go see a viewing of true Naruto style of the movie.
10112000	10117000	And I was more hyped about the fact that this is a convention center that's open 24 hours.
10117000	10121000	Where have you been my entire life? And stuff like that does not exist here.
10121000	10124000	Once it hits 2 a.m., get out.
10124000	10130000	Yeah, San Jose Convention Center is a little unique in that, and I think it's because the hotel practically is like inside.
10130000	10134000	The hotel is so connected to the convention center, I think it lets him get away with a little more.
10134000	10140000	Because not the entire convention center is open 24 hours, just kind of that wing near the hotels.
10140000	10144000	Okay, see, that's cool. If they could do something like that, that would work.
10144000	10153000	And besides, as big as I think the Marriott is right next to the Reagan Convention Center, they could put a few arcade machines in and do some 24-hour stuff. It's plausible.
10153000	10160000	Maybe there's other ways to think about it, because the concert hall doesn't need to be 24 hours. They don't run concerts 24 hours.
10160000	10168000	So maybe that's something that's in the convention center, and maybe some of the things that are more on a time, like panels and things would be over there too.
10168000	10172000	And then, yeah, the arcades try to fit it in the hotel somewhere.
10173000	10184000	I kind of feel like MAGFest isn't really listening to that they need to figure out how to solve this problem, and that could mean they need to change location.
10184000	10192000	I mean, they might be locked into the Gaylord for a couple more years. I think that's really what it boils down to, is that they're under contract to do this there a few more years.
10193000	10199000	It's that too, but I will say this. This will probably explain a lot of stuff.
10199000	10207000	Despite all the issues with MAGFest, according to the contract, he doesn't really give a damn.
10207000	10215000	Because he knows for a fact, as popular as this con is, people will still show up so they don't really care.
10216000	10218000	Until they don't anymore.
10218000	10230000	Which is true, but right now I can't think of anything else, and within my squad of people, we're like, well, you got MAGFest, and you got PAX, and we're like, why God, why?
10232000	10237000	Alright, well, we'll see what happens after this year and the feedback they're gonna get.
10237000	10241000	Yeah, because after this year, come 2019, I'm going to CES.
10241000	10243000	Ooh, that'd be a fun show.
10243000	10249000	Oh, yes indeed. I said no, after the bullshit with the badges and the bullshit with the whole, no.
10249000	10256000	No, no, I went through this shit once with PAX East. I am not going through this shit again.
10256000	10266000	I'd rather take time off, go to Vegas, meet up with some friends, have a good time, and enjoy myself, instead of having to deal with this type of stress. Nope, not happening.
10266000	10268000	Yeah, I hear you on that.
10268000	10271000	Alright, Rama, I'm gonna let you go try squeezing some more calls, but thanks for your call.
10271000	10273000	Got it, man. Oh, yeah, by the way, Rob?
10273000	10274000	Yes.
10274000	10275000	Stay black, man.
10275000	10277000	I will do my very best.
10277000	10278000	Awesome.
10278000	10279000	Alright, bye.
10279000	10280000	Bye.
10280000	10290000	Orange Launch Radio, all one word on Skype. Let's see if we can get to another call. Hopefully, it's gonna connect magically on the PC. Once again, hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
10290000	10293000	Yeah, this is Raginator.
10293000	10295000	Hey, Raginator. What's on your mind tonight? How you doing?
10296000	10306000	Well, I would rather not get into that. It's not show worthy, but anyway, just got two quick topics real quick.
10306000	10307000	Sure.
10308000	10330000	Anyway, I know it's not something you normally cover on the show per se, but it is game related. For those that are into pen and paper RPGs, there is actually a book bundle on Humble Bundle right now.
10330000	10350000	I think it's due to expire in like two days, but I think it's, if I'm looking at this right, there's some kind of series called Pathfinder. I'm not really familiar with that, but for those that are familiar with the series or maybe interested, it might be worth it. I don't know.
10350000	10373000	Yeah, I think that's what Ian Rama just lit up in chat. Ooh, Pathfinder. I think that's a pretty clever thing to give away in the book bundle is books about role playing games. Heck, I remember, you know, I didn't get super into D&D, but I certainly had those trips to Barnes and Noble back in the day where like some of my friends wanted to buy like a Dungeon Master Guide or a expansion book or whatever it is. I think it's a pretty clever thing to give away. Heck yeah.
10373000	10387000	Those books can be expensive, so that's a really good idea. Plus it's like the biggest obstacle to getting into role playing is not having the books. And a lot of people's solution is just, oh, go pirate it because they're easy and they're online. But like having them like legit available is really good.
10387000	10389000	Yeah, for sure.
10389000	10403000	Secondly, before I let you go and again take more calls, I just want to chime in about the whole microtransaction thing that's been going on.
10403000	10417000	You know, I can see microtransactions in the free to play games, be it Dota 2 or whatever. Those games are free. The developers need to make money somehow.
10417000	10433000	And, you know, I know there's a lot of people that don't see a single penny to those games, but there are those people that, you know, tend to spend a lot of money on the game over time.
10433000	10445000	You know, they kind of use the mentality, you know, oh, it's just a dollar here, just a dollar there. Over time, you're probably going to spend more than 60 bucks on that kind of game, you know.
10445000	10457000	But in terms of games that you're already actually paying $60 plus upfront, I think it's a little overkill. What do you think?
10458000	10469000	Well, I mean, I think you've probably heard Logie's opinion pretty loud and strong is that I think it's a very similar kind of concept is that, well, if the game's free to play, then of course they're paying for it somehow.
10469000	10481000	Loot boxes are expected, but it's a little crappy. It's a lot of crappy. When you're paying 60 bucks for what? What am I paying 60 bucks for if then all this other stuff ends up being behind the gate?
10481000	10492000	Is the value of a $60 game getting diminished because you're not really, you're getting what, five maps in Battlefront with your 60 bucks, just have all this other stuff, you know, gated, even though I know that's not loot boxes.
10492000	10500000	But still, I think that's kind of what the point boils down to really at the end of the day is that the value of what a $60 game is is diminishing with a lot of this stuff.
10500000	10506000	Now, granted, that's where we had the email earlier tonight from Martin going, well, then why not charge $80 for a game?
10506000	10512000	And, you know, since, you know, clearly that's what they want is they want more money from the game, but it is a slippery slope.
10512000	10525000	And then indie developers are able to make bang up games for 20 bucks. Hell, sometimes five bucks, depending on, you know, where you're going for the experience and what it is you're looking for.
10525000	10536000	Um, it's, it's just, it's, it's a very interesting kind of crossroads in this industry, but I have a feeling, RageNator, at the end of the day, you know, we always say vote with your wallet.
10536000	10548000	And I think more and more of these single player games with this stuff locked behind it are going to get outed on places like Twitter, and it's going to impact the bottom line of a game.
10548000	10556000	It's different when it's like the cosmetic stuff and the stuff we've kind of seen so far, like what Overwatch does and all of that, because we've kind of all accepted it.
10556000	10564000	And the people that are crazy about Overwatch still pay money for the loot boxes and all right, cool, that's where they're making the money.
10564000	10587000	But I think if people really start to push back against the whole, like, content behind this, I think you're going to see developers probably implement it less because developers don't want to spend 60 million dollars developing their game just to have the internet take a giant shit on it. Ask fans of Mass Effect about that one.
10587000	10602000	Yeah, and on a related note, you know, you brought up, you know, I figured whether it was you or Loki, but, you know, you brought up the fun factor versus graphics, and I totally agree.
10602000	10626000	I mean, you know, if you're talking about, like, you know, the 80s and 90s, then, you know, back then, you know, when you saw leaps and bounds in graphics, you know, like from the Atari to the NES or NES to the Super Nintendo, then, yeah, you can, you know, make arguments about the whole wow factor.
10626000	10642000	You know, hell, you know, when I first saw a video of, you know, Super Castlevania IV, you know, I was wowed by that, but at the same time, you know, nowadays, we're getting to the whole diminishing returns things.
10643000	10667000	Are we, though? Because, you know, now games are going to 4K, and even, you know, I don't know if I see, like, a huge, huge difference in 4K, but, like, I know the refresh rate is one that's really wowed me, is that now that, you know, you have more TVs with a 60 hertz refresh rate, and, you know, you're seeing that in more games, like, that higher frame rate is, like, really impressive, and it makes things almost look even more like real life.
10667000	10679000	And, yeah, I can really see the difference between something that was on PlayStation 3 and, you know, now PlayStation 4, and especially Xbox One X at this point, and those Forza trailers and things like that.
10679000	10688000	So just when you wonder, and you know what we say here on OLR, just when you wonder how they're going to push it one step further, everything's one step closer to the holodeck.
10688000	10693000	Gaming doesn't end until we have the holodeck.
10693000	10694000	Yeah, good point.
10694000	10695000	All right.
10695000	10699000	Well, I'm going to let you go so you can take more calls, but thanks for taking my call.
10699000	10700000	You're welcome.
10700000	10701000	Have a good one.
10701000	10702000	Have a good one.
10702000	10703000	Take care of yourself.
10703000	10704000	Bye-bye.
10705000	10706000	All right.
10706000	10709000	But I was going to mention, since you mentioned, you know, everything's going towards the holodeck.
10709000	10710000	Yeah.
10710000	10714000	What's the holodeck adding to gaming versus what we have now?
10714000	10717000	Better experience, better gameplay.
10717000	10721000	Once again, that is the most important thing when it comes to a game.
10721000	10724000	Completely immersive pornography.
10724000	10725000	Well, yes.
10725000	10728000	That is also the end game, yes.
10728000	10730000	And completely assertive pornography.
10730000	10731000	Yeah.
10731000	10741000	Just think what the holodeck is going to do to the prostitution and rent boy industry when that comes out, and it's that immersive.
10741000	10742000	Hey, look, a call.
10742000	10743000	Just think about that.
10743000	10744000	I know.
10744000	10745000	Hey, look, a call.
10745000	10746000	It's saving us from porn discussion.
10746000	10748000	And this will probably be it for the night.
10748000	10749000	So, hi, you're on Orange on Trady.
10749000	10750000	Who's this?
10750000	10751000	Hey, what's up?
10751000	10752000	This is Kaijuto.
10752000	10753000	Hey, Kaijuto.
10753000	10754000	What's on your mind, my friend?
10754000	10755000	Actually, I'm going to answer the porn conversation.
10755000	10759000	You know that PlayStation VR, you can check out porn now.
10759000	10760000	It's pretty...
10760000	10762000	That's all I'm going to say.
10762000	10763000	I enjoyed it.
10763000	10764000	But...
10764000	10765000	Fair enough.
10765000	10766000	Yeah, but noted.
10766000	10767000	The porn selection is important.
10767000	10768000	Yeah, stay in the...
10768000	10769000	Noted.
10769000	10770000	Dark Tetsuya, put that on the wiki.
10770000	10772000	Kaijuto called to talk in about porn.
10772000	10773000	Thank you.
10773000	10774000	All right.
10775000	10782200	But really, to be honest with you, we've all been watching porn since we were kids.
10782200	10790000	And when I watched porn in VR, it was like watching porn for the first time again, man.
10790000	10791000	Amazing.
10791000	10792000	I just...
10792000	10793000	Anyway...
10793000	10794000	We've been watching porn since we were kids.
10794000	10795000	I was 18.
10795000	10796000	Thank you very much.
10796000	10798000	Am I the only one that caught that?
10798000	10799000	No.
10799000	10800000	All right.
10800000	10803000	Maybe not all of us, but I was.
10803000	10804000	But...
10804000	10805000	What was I calling about?
10805000	10806000	Oh, yeah.
10806000	10807000	So...
10807000	10808000	VR porn.
10808000	10812000	What were you originally calling about before this show literally went to hell?
10812000	10815000	No, I was actually calling about VR.
10815000	10818000	I wanted to recommend two games to Loki.
10818000	10824000	If you haven't heard me on Black Wolf, you got to try Smashbox Battle Arena and Spark.
10824000	10827000	Those are two of the best VR games ever played.
10827000	10829000	Like multiplayer VR games.
10829000	10830000	Amazing, man.
10830000	10831000	So much fun.
10831000	10832000	I'm gonna say...
10832000	10833000	Why?
10833000	10835000	Oh, because it's crazy fun, man.
10835000	10839000	It's like you feel like you're actually out with a group of people and enjoy...
10839000	10844000	Remember when you were a kid and you would play dodgeball or you would go to the rec center?
10844000	10846000	You feel like you're doing all that stuff in VR.
10846000	10847000	No lie.
10847000	10852000	I mean, you legit feel like you're out in a community of people and you're interacting
10852000	10854000	and you're doing stuff and you're playing these sports games.
10854000	10855000	Oh, hooray.
10855000	10856000	It's just a lot of fun.
10856000	10858000	Can I get picked last in this too?
10858000	10862000	Actually, in Smashbox Arena, it is something like that.
10862000	10863000	I remember watching a review.
10863000	10867000	Somebody reviewed Smashbox Arena and they said that they felt like they were a kid in
10867000	10871000	the playground again being picked because they actually do have a picking system.
10871000	10874000	It's three versus three in Smashbox Arena.
10874000	10877000	So if you want to be on the blue team, there's only two teams, blue and orange.
10877000	10880000	If you want to be on the orange team, you have to stand in the orange box.
10880000	10884000	And if somebody doesn't want to be on your team, they'll jump over to the blue box and
10884000	10887000	you just get that feeling of, oh, they think I suck.
10887000	10888000	Yeah.
10888000	10891000	Bobby Blackwater says, this is not selling me on this game.
10891000	10892000	Yeah.
10892000	10897000	Well, let's focus less on getting picked last and let's talk about the fun factor.
10897000	10901000	If you have an option that if you don't stand in the box, it'll auto sign you to a team.
10901000	10904000	So you don't have to go through that humiliation if you don't want to.
10904000	10905000	Okay.
10905000	10906000	Fair enough.
10906000	10907000	Some of us like that.
10907000	10908000	It's fun.
10908000	10909000	Okay.
10909000	10910000	You ended that well.
10910000	10911000	Good.
10911000	10912000	All right.
10912000	10918000	Are the games pre-constructed or is it more like you just have a big sandbox where you
10918000	10919000	can do anything?
10919000	10922000	It's kind of like a combination of both.
10922000	10924000	With Smashbox Arena, they put you...
10924000	10926000	I can't remember how many arenas they are.
10926000	10928000	They might be over maybe five right now.
10928000	10930000	I think they said they're going to add more to it.
10930000	10935000	But they put you in this little box arena and each box has a theme.
10935000	10937000	One, you're at a construction site.
10937000	10940000	Another one, you're at a space station.
10940000	10943000	There's one that looks like you're out in Arizona somewhere.
10943000	10948000	And what happens is you hear an announcer and they say, they count down and then they
10948000	10949000	say, ready, go.
10949000	10952000	And then when they say go, they drop all these balls out of the sky.
10952000	10955000	So basically, that's how you get your ammunition for your gun.
10955000	10957000	You have to run and collect the ball.
10957000	10959000	You can only collect two at a time.
10959000	10964000	You have to collect this ball and then teleport around and dodge balls that other people are
10964000	10966000	shooting at you, try to shoot another person with your ball.
10966000	10971000	They also have these special balls, like one special wall.
10971000	10978000	They have a sniper gun.
10978000	10980000	They have the usual stuff you'll find in a first-person shooter, like a sniper gun.
10980000	10985000	They have this other thing that shoots this big Indiana Jones boulder-looking thing at
10985000	10986000	your opponents, which is really funny.
10986000	10988000	It's fun to get caught by that.
10988000	10993000	You're just out there and out of nowhere, this big giant ball comes rolling you over.
10993000	10994000	It's just a lot of fun.
10994000	10998000	And then there's teleportation in the game, which also, I don't know, it kind of adds
10998000	11000000	to the charm of the game.
11000000	11003000	The game looks like crap, by the way, just if you go to look it up.
11003000	11007000	It looks terrible, but I don't know, there's a charm about it that I really like.
11007000	11012000	I'll not explain it, but when you spawn, you throw this little spinning top thing.
11012000	11014000	And that's how you know where you're going to land.
11014000	11018000	That's how you point in what direction you want to go to, and a little spinning thing
11018000	11021000	pops out, and then you spawn in that direction.
11021000	11023000	You have to move around with the move controllers.
11023000	11027000	I don't know, it sounds crazy, but it's a fun game.
11027000	11030000	I never had that much fun in VR.
11030000	11031000	It sounds interesting.
11031000	11034000	The only thing that might be souring me a little bit on it is that you said there's
11034000	11036000	a stage that's Arizona.
11036000	11039000	Why would I go into VR just to go to Arizona?
11039000	11041000	Well, it looks like that to me.
11041000	11046000	Any time I see orange mountains and that type of thing, I always think of Arizona for some
11046000	11047000	reason.
11047000	11050000	But to someone else, it could be Stonehenge, it could be whatever, because they do have
11050000	11051000	grass in there.
11051000	11055000	It's so you can see how pretty Arizona can be without having to deal with triple digit
11055000	11056000	heat.
11056000	11057000	I guess that's fair.
11057000	11058000	All right.
11058000	11059000	Can I shoot him, my friend?
11059000	11062000	I'm going to let you go so we wrap up the show, but thank you for your discussion on
11062000	11064000	raining balls and porn.
11064000	11067000	Yes, Smashbox Arena and Spark.
11067000	11069000	Two games you can't go wrong with, trust me.
11069000	11070000	PSVR, get them.
11070000	11072000	All right, take care, my friend.
11072000	11073000	All right.
11073000	11075000	That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
11075000	11079000	If you didn't get through and you want to in the future, you can call us next week,
11079000	11081000	because apparently Skype works again magically.
11081000	11083000	Or you can always send us an email.
11083000	11087000	Participate at OrangeLawnTrader.com is the best place to send your emails.
11087000	11089000	We'll read some more of those next week.
11089000	11093000	In the meantime, we do have to wrap up the show for the night, but I got to go around
11093000	11094000	and get everybody's final thoughts first.
11094000	11097000	First, I'm going to say thank you as always for listening to the show.
11097000	11101000	Thank you for downloading the show, and we really appreciate you taking the time to check
11101000	11102000	out OLR.
11102000	11105000	If you enjoyed what you heard here at OLR, please tell a friend or five about the show.
11105000	11108000	Help us spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
11108000	11112000	Every gamer has a voice when, you know, the voices are here to air.
11112000	11114000	Yeah, five-star reviews on places like iTunes.
11114000	11116000	Those go a long way as well.
11116000	11119000	So definitely can always use those.
11119000	11122000	We'll be back, of course, to do this all again next week in seven days.
11122000	11126000	Although our pal Bobby will not be here next week, we will be here next week.
11126000	11130000	And I'm likely to have a hoarse voice as I'm hosting Rocky Horror next Saturday.
11130000	11132000	And you always know when I come in the day after that, I'm like,
11132000	11135000	I've got an orange lantern right here.
11135000	11136000	So that'll be fun.
11136000	11138000	Anyway, final thoughts for now.
11138000	11139000	JD, thank you for being here.
11139000	11141000	I'm sorry because of the mic situation.
11141000	11143000	We didn't get to hear from you a lot at the beginning of the show, but at least we got
11143000	11146000	you to fill in here a little bit at the back half, but always good to have you here.
11146000	11147000	Yeah, it was fun.
11147000	11148000	Thank you.
11148000	11150000	Anything you want to plug while you're here?
11150000	11152000	Do you have a book you're writing?
11152000	11154000	Do you have a Twitch channel?
11154000	11156000	My ADHD is way too bad to write a book.
11156000	11162000	I do have a Twitch channel that has one saved stream on it, because I'm very new at this.
11163000	11168000	I think it's twitch.com slash J-A-I underscore D-I-T.
11168000	11180000	And I'm probably only going to do Cook, Serve, Delicious too, unless someone has requests or something.
11180000	11185000	I'm probably not going to stream coming out on top or anything, because that probably breaks the Twitch rules.
11185000	11193000	But yeah, I also have a Twitter with the same username, and I try to be funny.
11193000	11194000	Fantastic.
11194000	11197000	All right, let's see.
11197000	11200000	Let's go over to Loki and your final thought tonight.
11200000	11203000	My final thought is I did have one last minute story.
11203000	11204000	Oh, oops.
11204000	11205000	I forgot to look for those.
11205000	11206000	Sorry.
11206000	11212000	So real quick, the Steam holiday sale dates have been leaked, so you can expect the Steam
11212000	11219000	Halloween sale to run from October 26th to November 1st, the Black Friday sale from November 22nd to November 28th,
11219000	11224000	and finally the winter sale from December 21st to January 4th.
11224000	11228000	And then my final thought is Stranger Things is coming out on Friday.
11228000	11229000	Oh, yeah.
11229000	11231000	That's another thing to look forward to this week, huh?
11231000	11232000	Yes.
11232000	11233000	So I'm looking forward to that.
11233000	11234000	All right.
11234000	11240000	And my final thought tonight is I don't know.
11240000	11244000	I'm going to play more Pokémon, maybe, until I get distracted with Destiny.
11244000	11245000	That's for sure.
11245000	11247000	Are you finally going to finish a Pokémon game?
11247000	11249000	Let's not talk crazy now.
11249000	11252000	Because come Tuesday, it'll be, ooh, shiny, Destiny.
11252000	11255000	And then Friday, ooh, shinier, Mario Odyssey.
11255000	11256000	But this is Gen 2.
11256000	11258000	It's ooh, shiny, like, possibly.
11258000	11259000	I see what you did there.
11259000	11260000	I see what you did there.
11260000	11263000	All right, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
11263000	11264000	We will see you next week.
11264000	11265000	Bye bye.
11265000	11269000	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
