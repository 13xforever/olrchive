00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,140
Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

8
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,000
really horrible stuff out there in the world, so I hope we can take your mind off it for

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,420
a couple hours tonight while we talk about some video games here in our studio, and seven

10
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,740
and located in Sacramento, California with me, Rob Roberts. You might know me on Twitter

11
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:04,340
at Skie, S-K-I-E, and joining me as she usually does right over there, DarkSakura or Jamie

12
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:09,480
Summers. Oh hi. Hi, how are you Jamie? I'm okay. Yeah? I like your hair, you have this

13
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,980
like, and I know it's a radio show so I have to describe it, but she's got like this purple

14
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:17,660
on top kind of fading down into black, it's like the fade. It's purple to purple. Jamie's

15
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,920
in the fade. It's like fuchsia to purple. It looks black but it's also kind of dark

16
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,840
in the studio because it's trying to keep the heat down a little bit. Okay, I can kind

17
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,760
of see it. Yeah, in purple. Eh, radio, you'll just have to, you know. Take our word for

18
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:32,200
it. Exactly. Use your imagination. That's right, use your imagination, it'll take you

19
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,000
very far. Well we'll check in with Jamie and her gaming week in just a minute, but I want

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,680
to talk to Techmaster Loki as well. Hello. Hi, how are you, Loki? I'm good. Hey, everybody's

21
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,880
here this week. Yay. It's not yay. What a nice reunion we're having tonight. And we're

22
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,360
relatively plague free. That's right, relatively. Hopefully everybody stays disease free for

23
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:57,000
a while here. How are you doing, Loki? I'm doing fine. Yeah, I'm full. Full of what?

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,200
Hamburger. Hamburger. Hamburger. Yeah, because they went, they opened up a way back burgers,

25
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,880
I guess. Never heard of that. It's, I guess it's a nationwide chain, but it's a burger

26
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:12,240
place. They make like fresh burgers and that type of stuff and it's really good. Do Sherman

27
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:17,280
and Peabody deliver it from ancient Greece? How come we don't have restaurant sponsors

28
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,240
on this show? All these people you give a shout out to don't give us money. So now you

29
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,520
need to see some, say something bad about your experience. These pitas are brought to

30
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,360
you by Sarah. Well, the fries were just kind of okay. They're all right. They weren't like

31
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,600
fantastic. Thank you. Thank you. All right. We also have a special guest in studio. I

32
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:37,200
do want to of course always acknowledge the ever present guests that's on our show at

00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,640
but we do have a special guest here in studio. Actually, Jamie, do you want to introduce

38
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:04,320
somebody? Somebody that the audience has been asking to have back. So Jamie, some kid we

39
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:12,380
picked up in the back alley from a free candy truck. Stop picked up from a candy truck.

40
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:18,420
So welcome back to the show everybody. Julian is back this week. How you doing? Good. Good.

41
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,800
Now for some folks listening to the show who might not know you, how old are you? I'm 10

42
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,680
years old. You're 10 years old. When's your birthday? Um, April 27th. Okay. So you're

43
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:32,300
like 10 and a half almost. Almost. All right. Getting close, getting close. Uh, so, so you

44
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:37,600
did not come from a candy van, but what kind of car do you want to drive someday? I have

45
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:45,360
no idea. How am I supposed to know? I'm 10 years old. I just got told he's going to have

46
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,360
a testerosa cause he's going to be super rich and famous one day for his wit and humor.

47
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:55,980
I just, I just wanted mom to be thinking about that. That's only six years away to start

48
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:00,120
thinking about all that stuff. But anyway, all right. All right. It's, it's a video game

49
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:06,720
show, Julian. Um, hopefully you've never heard it cause it's very disgusting sometimes. We

50
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,160
can say whatever we want to around him. It's a joke. It's a joke. What types of, what types

51
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:18,560
of video games do you like to play, Julian? Um, I like to play puzzle fantasy sci-fi games.

52
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:27,920
Um, um, I like to play, um, puzzle games, fantasy games, sci-fi games. I find those

53
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:32,440
games the most entertaining for me. Okay. When you first said puzzle fantasy sci-fi

54
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,280
was like, wow, did he find a game that's like all three of those things? Cause that would

55
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,400
be really cool. Like a game like that. I don't know. Have you ever played puzzle quest? That's

56
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:46,440
kind of puzzle and fantasy a little bit. No, I've never heard of that game. That could

57
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:50,600
be portal. Okay. Yeah. Portal. Well, what kind of, do you have, do you have some titles,

58
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:57,440
some games that you like to play? Um, I like to play undertale. Okay. Oh, that's a good

59
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:05,080
one. Spore game about evolution. Yeah. Okay. Oh, yes. Spore. Um, I like pirate one on one.

60
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:11,840
Okay. Um, I try to think of games that I play. That's okay. I find myself in that position

61
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,720
every week on this show. Like, what did I play this past week? So undertale, undertale

62
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,640
is like hugely popular. I don't know if you know, but like even people that are like four

63
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:24,400
times your age enjoy playing undertale and they just, do you play it on the PC or do

64
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:32,080
you play it on PlayStation or PC? And, um, about a month ago it was on Joe's birthday.

65
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:37,280
It was whose birthday? About a month ago. It was undertale's on second birthday. Oh,

66
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:44,520
I didn't know that. So undertale was two years old as of, okay. Did you do anything to celebrate?

67
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:54,160
Um, at daycare we play the game and everyone had to be an undertale character. So it was

68
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,280
undertale. I'm detecting he might've been sand. Wait, is, of course I was saying I'm

69
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:06,840
going to be, I don't know. Is, is undertale like, cause I don't really know like the reason

70
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:12,840
why you're here, you're kind of like our ambassador to the next generation of gamers. Uh, so,

71
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:21,360
so is undertale like really popular with other like boys and girls your age? Um, very big.

72
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:29,440
I know tons of people at school that, um, play undertale a whole lot. And, um, some of them are

73
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:35,400
like hashtag pacifist run and then another, and other people are like, kill them all.

74
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:41,720
Genocide run is so fun. I love shooting sands. Wait, wait, wait, wait. 10 year olds have hashtag

75
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:47,960
Wars. That's just something I learned. I always, I always thought that was something unique to

76
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:53,160
RuPaul's drag race is when they would, you know, put in the corner, you know, hashtag, you know,

77
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:58,440
shantay, you stay or whatever it is going on there. But okay. So, so hashtag pacifist run

78
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:05,000
versus hashtag genocide run. All right. On the next Splatfest. Do you play Splatoon? I like that

79
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:13,640
game. Um, I, um, I've heard of people that play Splatoon, but I don't really play Splatoon.

80
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,800
That's okay. That's okay. There's a lot of games to play. Like there's just, you, you could play a

81
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,800
different video game every day and you'd never play them all. That's, that's the, that's the

82
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:29,400
reality. So, um, one of the reasons I think part one on one is a great and also a funny game is

83
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:34,840
one of the, um, questions it asks you, but when you build your character, is it, it goes like

84
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:43,720
this. So, um, you know, you know, where you're an orphan, how'd your parents die? That's,

85
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:50,760
that sounds kind of morbid, Julian. I don't know. You like that? I, um, chose that. I chose,

86
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:58,680
that's okay. I chose, um, that, um, I chose that my parents were eaten by a sky squid. Okay. I'm

87
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:06,360
sure that makes your mother feel great once you hear that. A sky squid. All right. I got to go.

88
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:11,080
So, so I'm looking at our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com because I don't know if you

89
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,040
know, but this is, this is actually like on the internet and people are listening to it right

90
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:18,600
now. And so, so there's some feedback going on right now. Let's see. Uh, Bobby Black Wolf is

91
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,920
suggesting he's too old for Splatoon and that that's for babies. That might be the reason why

92
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:28,120
you haven't played Splatoon. Uh, let's see. Uh, Dungeon Buster says, is he looking forward to

93
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:32,920
Wolfenstein the new colossus this month? Are there any games you're looking forward to? Maybe

94
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:36,840
if not that one, is there anything like you got your eye on like, Ooh, I want to play that when

95
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:43,880
it comes out? Um, the new dragon age that, um, game that's supposed to, um, come out. I'm playing

96
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,880
after that one comes out. I want to start to play the series and then play that one. You are

97
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:53,320
definitely your mother's child. I, but that's great. What do you like about dragon age? Um,

98
00:08:54,280 --> 00:09:02,280
I think it's a cool game. It's, um, um, fantasy. Like I said that I liked, um,

99
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:09,160
fancy games. It also has a great, um, story and, um, it's just a fun game that

100
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:14,440
a lot of people also like too. Yeah. Black Wolf would like to follow up with that. Who is he

101
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:21,640
going to romance? No one. Good. Because you're 10. You don't need to worry about Selbasy run.

102
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:37,080
I broke Rob. Rob is now turning bright fuchsia. He matches my hair. Well done Julian. Well done.

103
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:45,880
Show's over. Going home. Bye. When I'm dead, turn the show over to Julian.

104
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:55,800
Rob's done. All right. Let's see. I'm looking in chat. Brad from pop culture says, damn it. Loki.

105
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:02,200
I just spit water at the monitor. Uh, I love it. Uh, a lot of people taken surprise in our

106
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,200
chat to the fact that undertale is kind of the game that people play in the school yard and

107
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,760
the undertale, uh, is, is the thing that people play at school. What are, are there other games

108
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:15,880
that kids like to, like, are there other like video game, like playground games that kids get

109
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:25,000
into? Um, sometimes when they're supposed to be playing, um, this was in fourth grade when, um,

110
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,000
kids were supposed to be on Moby max. People would sneak onto prodigy and play, uh, the wizarding

111
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:38,120
math game of fantasy. Wait, wait, wait. Prodigy prodigy prodigy still exists. Prodigy still exists.

112
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:43,160
That's what, that was my, that was me when I was like 12 was prodigy. I was, I, I wonder if it's

113
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:48,600
the same thing or if it's like somebody else has the name now. It's a video game. Yeah. Well,

114
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,080
when I was attainment, when I was younger, it was, it was games and a bunch of other stuff too,

115
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:57,160
but the games were probably the best special chat rooms. Wink, wink. Exactly. Exactly. That

116
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:03,080
sort of thing. So of course, you know, I met Dan through AOL back in the sailor moon chat room.

117
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,800
Remember that Becky? Oh, sorry. We had, we had an eye roll.

118
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:16,040
So, so, um, you, do you prefer to game on PC versus like PlayStation four and Xbox? Like,

119
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:21,960
are you in the great PC versus console debate? Where do you stand? I, um, definitely like PC

120
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:29,000
more because it can, it has a much wider variety of games and it has a lot more things you can do

121
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:38,760
on it. And it's just, I think it's, um, better, just much, much better. We, um,

122
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:45,080
because it can, um, play games that are eight bit, 16 bit, 32 bit, and even 64 bit.

123
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,880
It can do it all. It can. And then if it can't do it anymore, you just put a new card in it and

124
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:55,800
now it can do it. That's, that's how those PCs work. Absolutely. Absolutely. Okay. So sometimes

125
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:01,960
don't listen to them. Little Mac. Sometimes we get really lucky here at OLR and sometimes people

126
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:07,640
that actually make games, listen to our show. Uh, have you ever tried to make a game Julian?

127
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:11,960
Actually, I'm really curious about that. Have you ever tried to make a game? Like, do they teach you

128
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:18,600
any type of like programming in school now? I'm planning that I want to eventually make a game,

129
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:26,520
but I'm taking, um, coding classes, um, right now so that I can learn to program so I can

130
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:30,520
eventually make my own video game. Do you know what they call the, do you know what language

131
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,240
they're teaching you? Do you know what it's called? Do you know if they're teaching you,

132
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:41,320
like unity or language? Uh, I actually know, um, three languages. Okay. One of them is English.

133
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:47,080
Okay, good. That's a good one to know. Yeah. The second one is the one that my mom taught

134
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:53,480
and other people taught me. It's, um, called Pic Latin. Oh, okay. And the third one is me and

135
00:12:53,480 --> 00:13:00,040
the one that me and my friends made up. Um, Lee Latin is where you, um, it's pretty much, um,

136
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:09,000
Pic Latin, but instead of, um, saying Julian Jay, you'd say Julian July. So,

137
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:21,800
Aloha. I'm trying. Oh, video game language. Well, I was fascinated by the Pic Latin stuff too,

138
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,160
but yeah, sadly you can't build a video game in Pic Latin. At least not yet.

139
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,080
I'll do Wingdings as the font. Just kidding.

140
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:36,520
And maybe work some Comic Sans. Just kidding. Into it. I'm sorry. I'm going to have to put

141
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:41,640
him in the freezer. It was nice knowing you, Julian. Get in the freezer. Well,

142
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:49,160
that's a little cold of you to say. I will lock you in the meat locker.

143
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:57,000
I would like to apologize for that. That's entirely my fault. Thank you,

144
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,600
mom. Is that where Julia is the mistress of dad jokes. I appreciate that. I appreciate that.

145
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:07,320
All right. Uh, yeah. Going into chat, uh, MXC says I am dying. Come on,

146
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:12,600
no Gus says someone hit a gong. Matt says, did he find Drew's joke book? I think so.

147
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,400
We didn't flush it. We had to press it between wax sheets so that it wouldn't dissolve.

148
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:22,200
All right. As we all know, it's made out of toilet paper. So, so, so as far as like making

149
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,800
the video games, you're not sure like what the name of the tool is that you're using to make

150
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:33,800
video games or I don't know, um, what, um, um, tool, tool I'm going to use for, for making a

151
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:39,560
video game. I know what I could call it. Okay. That's what I was going to ask you. As I was

152
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:43,240
gonna say, we have people that listen to the show that are, you know, we're lucky that we do have

153
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:47,720
actually game makers listening to this show. I don't know if you know, but orange sounds radio,

154
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:54,040
someone actually made a game, actually two games based on ideas that we put out there. So I was

155
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:59,080
going to say Julian, maybe the game makers out there want to know what game do you want to see?

156
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:07,000
What game do you want to play? Um, I, um, saw this, um, eight bit 16 bit game that a, um,

157
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:13,080
14 year old, um, game, what it was, um, a past game that one of my favorite YouTubers played.

158
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:20,200
He's extremely British. Um, and, um, it was called the mark of oxen and that kind of inspired me

159
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:26,840
to make a game like that, but not eight bit. Uh, so you want it, you want to do a modern version

160
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:33,160
of that, but maybe, uh, but I wanna, I want it to be kind of based on that, but not really

161
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:44,200
just make the whole entire game again, but just 64 bit or something. I want to like have,

162
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:51,240
I want to base my game on that and I want to, um, change the dialogue. I want the same fighting

163
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:57,400
style as it, but I'm going to change a lot of the things. I just want to base my game on that.

164
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:02,280
All right. You know, and sometimes, sometimes you can, you can go back and you can reinvent an idea

165
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:06,840
and make it better. And you know, that, that might make like a really solid game. I think a ton of

166
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:11,000
people are trying to do that to Minecraft, but nothing's really stuck yet. I think Minecraft

167
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,280
is still kind of the, the big, big game in that genre and nobody's really topped it yet. So maybe

168
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:22,840
someday, maybe someday. And me, the 10 year old will make something way better than that stupid

169
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:32,600
14 year old can make. It's like, call them out. You call them out right here. I love it.

170
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:37,800
Julian's new handle is going to be shade tree. All right. All right. Well I do, I do, Julian,

171
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:42,200
I have to move on to some other topics here, uh, shortly to, to get into our show, but is there,

172
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:46,520
is there anything that you want to tell the gamers out there listening to orange on radio?

173
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:51,880
I can't think of anything. I don't know. That's okay. I usually can't either,

174
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:57,000
but Hey, do me a favor since, you know, you are a kid and I'm, I'm not, uh, you know, sometimes I

175
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,320
noticed out there, there's a lot of like negativity about video games out there. And I don't know

176
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,880
about you, but I think video games are pretty rad. So I like to try and keep it all positive

177
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,160
when we talk about video games, you know, sometimes there's a little thing here and

178
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:13,240
there where you might say, I wish they do this better. Cause this makes me really mad, but

179
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:17,720
I don't like to be mad all the time. So can you help me make sure that like 10 year olds

180
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:21,400
today are gonna like keep it positive with video games and keep this industry fun?

181
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:28,360
I don't think I, I need to tell them, um, to play video games. They're probably already playing at

182
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:37,080
20, um, um, um, 36 hours a day. That is true. Just as long as they're having fun doing it.

183
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,920
That's the important part. They're definitely having fun doing it. If they're playing at 36

184
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:45,960
hours a day. Yes. I should have thought of that. Yes. Well, they're playing 36 hours a day. They're

185
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:51,160
also traveling through time as well. So more props to them. They're doing something right.

186
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:56,040
Uh, let's see, Brad from pod culture and chat says, uh, Julian will get his game done before

187
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:03,400
Loki. That is probably true. That joke was like, I saw that joke before we even have the time

188
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:09,480
machine as well. Apparently. Well, I just have, it's predictable joke is predictable. So,

189
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:14,200
and look, you will also have, you know, his tingle costume made and invent the time turner.

190
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:18,120
You know, funny enough, actually that you mentioned the tingle costume because there was,

191
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:26,600
um, what was it? They did a new content cop that was popular on YouTube and Ian actually wears

192
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:32,120
a morph suit, tingle costume. Like, well, there it is. Apparently it does exist. So

193
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,960
that is true. I guess it's glad to know, glad to know that is out there. Somebody beat you to it.

194
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:42,760
Uh, one more question in our chat room, act after over at live.vog network.com wants to know

195
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:47,880
when are we giving Julian his own podcast? Uh, any, anytime he wants to do one, we'll,

196
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,240
we'll help him get one together. So he'll just have to get some friends together and

197
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,920
figure out what they want to talk about. Probably when I'm an adult.

198
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:02,440
Yes. Let's not rush anything. Yes. Let's not rush anything. You need to do is you need to get into

199
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:07,400
like, if you like toys and games and stuff like that, you start a toy and boxing channel, then

200
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:11,480
it just, it's a never ending cycle because you get views and you get, you know what Julian just

201
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,080
told you, he's going to do it when he's good and ready right now. He's going to enjoy being a kid.

202
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:21,160
Is that right? We get free toys. Yeah, exactly. I'm missing the point here.

203
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:28,280
This is Julian's show, not your show. If you want to do a free toy show or whatever to get toys,

204
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:34,200
then you, you, you go right ahead and start one. I'm not sure if it's legal for me to have my own

205
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:41,240
show yet. Well, that's true. I know there's four roles that they're on YouTube. I would

206
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:46,920
as long as your mom is aware of what you're doing. That's I think. Okay. She's she's got to open or,

207
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:51,480
you know, as long as somebody approves, she'll never know. I'll make my show in the sewer with

208
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:57,880
my friends. Oh, you're a Ninja turtle now. No. Okay. I don't have a shell.

209
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:08,760
I also speak English. Yeah. Yes. We can make you green. All right. Let's get, let's get into some

210
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:12,520
of the gaming topics from this past week. And Julian, if you do want to jump in at any time,

211
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:16,920
just, you know, shake Jamie and let her know you want the mic. All right. Uh, anyhow, let's talk

212
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:20,760
a little bit about before we get into our gaming weeks, you know, something that happened this past

213
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:24,520
week is the Nintendo world championships. Actually that just happened. What? Like,

214
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:28,200
was it yesterday or day before? You just have something on there. I was like,

215
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:33,080
I thought that happened yesterday. Well, no, the qualifiers, but the big event,

216
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:37,720
like the finals was yesterday. Yeah. I know. I think a lot of people, it's Saturday is a

217
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:42,520
weird day to do it. They advertised it so well. I know. I know. Right. Well, so it was, uh, it

218
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:47,880
was yesterday and they had it in Manhattan at the grand ballroom and it was on YouTube and Twitch,

219
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:54,680
but they also showed it on Disney XD in that DXP, uh, segment that they have on, on the Disney

220
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:58,760
kids channel, or I'm sorry, it's now at all Disney XD or whatever it's called. So they actually

221
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:02,920
showed it on TV. So that's something that the Nintendo championships are actually being shown

222
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:08,120
on TV. Uh, so what happened is that there is, I guess, I guess there was like a, it was like a

223
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:12,280
single elimination tournament and you had like two brackets. So once you got eliminated,

224
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:17,480
you went to the underground and otherwise you were in the above ground. Well, anyway,

225
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:23,320
some of the games that they had to play, let's see, in the above ground stage one was, uh,

226
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:28,440
there was a, like a relay between the legend of Zelda, breath of the wild in a shield surfing

227
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:34,280
race, a high score challenge in the home run contest of Smash Brothers for Wii U and a race

228
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:40,760
in Metroid Samus Returns. Okay. So the top 16 went on to stage two and that was two eight player

229
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:47,720
matches in Super Smash Brothers for Wii U. Stage three was a grand Prix of two races in Mario Kart

230
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:54,200
8 Deluxe. Stage four was a best of three match in Splatoon. And then the final four played one

231
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:59,720
versus one matches in Arms. Meanwhile, in the underground, it was completely different games.

232
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:06,200
Stage one was a high score challenge in Balloon Fight. Yep. 1985 from the NES. Then a stage two

233
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:11,080
was a high score challenge in a game called Bird and Beans, which I never played, but apparently

234
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:17,320
it was inspired by a WarioWare game. Uh, Donkey Kong Country Returns was stage three. Stage four

235
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:22,600
was Tetris for the Game Boy. That's pretty cool. Uh, and then the final underground stage was Mario

236
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:27,800
Party 2, some of the mini games. So you had the, the, the contestant from the underground and the

237
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:31,880
contestant from the above ground. They met in the final, final, final challenge, which was

238
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:38,360
Super Mar... I'm sorry. Super Mario Maker was the first finals game. Super Mario Brothers Deluxe,

239
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:44,440
Mario Odyssey was the big finish at the end. Of course they played a stage that nobody has seen

240
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:50,200
before. And I think we kind of all knew that this whole thing was just a promotion for Mario Odyssey,

241
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:54,200
right? It's a whole promotion for Nintendo stuff. I mean, come on. Yeah, it really was. I mean,

242
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:59,480
they had a lot of newer games in there and it all got screen time on Disney, you know, of all

243
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:05,240
things. So, but hey, I mean, that's come a long way. I don't remember the 1990 championships being

244
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:08,600
on TV. Was it? I think it might've been like covered on TV, but I don't remember it like

245
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:15,000
actually being on TV. And then the 2015 was all during E3. So it was kind of picked up as a part

246
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:22,680
of that, but, uh, yeah. So there you go. Uh, the final winner of the whole event was Thomas G. Uh,

247
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:28,840
and actually the runner up was the 2015 champion, John Numbers. So that's still not bad though,

248
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:33,800
to win two years ago and then be the runner up this year is still pretty good. So there it is,

249
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:38,440
Nintendo world championships. So, I mean, what do you guys think? Is the Nintendo world championships

250
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:43,000
something that Nintendo should be doing regularly or was this kind of a non-factor?

251
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
All right. I mean, I don't know. It's a fun little hype machine. It's just not,

252
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,880
I don't think it has the same draw as it did. Like, you know, back when we were growing up,

253
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:58,120
I mean, it's just kind of now it's very obvious that it's kind of a Nintendo commercial commercial

254
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:03,320
and it's like, Oh, you're the best at like the Nintendo game. Who cares? I mean, no one really,

255
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,960
that's what kind of seems like, but it's fine. It's cool to like see the new games and stuff.

256
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:11,480
I thought last year's was a little bit better though. Like, especially when I think there was

257
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:15,880
an internal championships where they did like the blind runs of like some of the Mario maker

258
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,960
levels. That was a good way to show up Mario maker. It was, I mean, nowadays though, people

259
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:24,280
do Mario maker runs all the time and it's like, eh, I don't know. Julian, what do you think?

260
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:34,920
I have a question. Okay. What is the, um, what, whatever it's called, the, um, Nintendo

261
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:39,640
championships or whatever. Yeah. The Nintendo world championships. Um, what is that? That's

262
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:44,840
a great question. I guess it's kind of like the Olympics or it's like a tournament,

263
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:49,320
but it's all Nintendo. So it's like a big Nintendo tournament, but it's all those games I just

264
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:55,480
named. It's not one game. You have to be good at every Nintendo game in order to win. Um,

265
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:01,320
the one that I knew the best that you named on the list was legend of Zelda, breath of the wild.

266
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:07,160
I thought I've, um, saw that game was, um, I've wanted that game since he came out, but

267
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:13,960
I don't want to have to buy the, um, Nintendo switch for it, but we, you know,

268
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:20,840
we're probably not going to buy a Wii U. That's all right. You let the games you want to accumulate.

269
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:25,240
And then someday when you do get a switch, maybe, you know, someday way, way down the line,

270
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:29,320
you can get all these games that you've been wanting to play. And then it's like,

271
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:34,520
Oh, you've you're, you'll be busy for the next year. So do you think, do you think you'd want

272
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:39,240
to compete in something like the Nintendo world championships? Was that, is that something you

273
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:46,680
want to do? No, I'll stick with, um, one of the one PVP and my pirate one Oh one world.

274
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:51,560
Okay. Fair enough. Fair. Wait a minute. So you mean if I, if I go online and I play one versus

275
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:58,200
one PVP in some of these games, I might be playing against you. Yes. And also don't,

276
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:04,840
I don't want your level 10. Everyone who's level 70 will harvest you and be you again and again

277
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:12,760
to get, to get a higher rank in PVP. That's not very nice. I know. I know. Level 70 people harvest

278
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:17,560
on the, on the lower level people. They need, they need to stop hating on the lower level.

279
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:20,920
How are you supposed to get to a higher level if they keep picking on you? Perhaps if a developer

280
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:30,040
puts an actual game balancing in it. Um, pretty much, um, what you do is, um, you paint him for

281
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:36,520
no reason. Just kidding. You don't do that. That'll just make them extremely mad. Now,

282
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:41,480
some of the chatters are suggesting, come on, Noel Gus in our chat room says someone show him that

283
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:46,840
eighties movie with Fred Savage. I think you're talking about the wizard monster. I think that

284
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:52,200
he has to play super Mario brothers three. So maybe I played it before. Okay. So you played

285
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:56,280
Mario brothers three. So I don't remember what the wizard is rated, but I can't imagine it was worse

286
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:00,920
than PG. So, uh, you know, maybe that's a movie you should, cause that that's, that's what was

287
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:05,640
out when I was 12 and that's when they hyped super Mario brothers three. It was like the first time

288
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:10,760
the world got to see it was in this movie. It was pretty cool. Okay. It's probably really corny now

289
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:14,600
in retrospect though. Cause a lot of eighties movies, a lot of eighties movies are pretty corny.

290
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:19,960
Do you ever watch movies in the eighties? I don't know. I don't ask, Hey mom, when I'm

291
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:25,160
going to see a movie, when I, when I go see, see a movie, I don't go to, I don't go to my mom and

292
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:34,200
say, Hey, is this movie from a 1980s and nine 1981, 1982, 1983. And then that's fair. You don't

293
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:41,080
judge. You don't judge. That's fair. All right. Oh yeah. I've seen karate kid. Oh, that's the

294
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:45,000
only one you need to see. Let's see. Mom. I want to see the new star Wars. You're going to watch

295
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:51,320
the old Mario brothers and you're going to like it. All right. Let's move on. Before we get into

296
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:55,720
the news this week, let's talk a little bit about our gaming weeks and the types of video games

297
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:59,000
we've been playing this week. Actually, while it's on my mind though, quickly, before I go to

298
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:04,920
dark soccer, I do want to say while Julian and his mom are still here, I do want to say, I did notice

299
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:11,880
that they brought a gift to the studio this week. So I guess this is like a belated celebration

300
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:17,560
cake of some sort, I believe. So, so you, so you, you actually baked a pumpkin spice cake. Am I

301
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:23,960
right? I did. I love you, Rob. I love you too. Anybody who makes me food. That's, that's an

302
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:28,520
amazing gesture. So I want to thank you very much for that. You are quite welcome. That pumpkin spice

303
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:37,160
case. Oh my God. What Trixie and Katya. Okay. I've been doing the happy dance since last night.

304
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:41,560
Okay. It has nothing to do with games. No, but although my understanding is I've been seeing it

305
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:46,040
on Twitter, I guess Trixie is doing something on Twitch TV, like right now, right? Helping

306
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:50,600
raise money for gamer X and that whole that they're doing back East. So that's pretty cool.

307
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:56,760
And Trixie did host at gamer X. Yeah. That was where I met her. Which I met her out of drag.

308
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:00,680
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So she, cause she was actually hanging out at the parties and stuff. Yep. All

309
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:05,480
right. All right. Well, let's get into our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have

310
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:11,240
been playing this week. Dark soccer. How was your gaming week? Um, semi eventful. I'm working on the

311
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:18,280
DerpyCon, uh, guide again. And this time I've kind of put my foot down on due dates. So I actually

312
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:25,160
have some time to do stuff. And so I am playing Danganronpa V3, which, um, I haven't been able

313
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:31,640
to stream. I'm not going to be able to stream it until I get, um, uh, until I get the book done,

314
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:37,480
but Danganronpa V3 is going to be up for stream in a couple of weeks. You know, once there,

315
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:44,600
I'm sure that spoilers have been spoiled, you know, in a very stinky spoilery manner. Um,

316
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:50,760
I am actually playing animal crossing happy home designer again, because I love that game. I'm

317
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:58,920
playing idle pouring, which is my handheld Ragnarok online. Um, Miitomo, Pokemon Go. Um,

318
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:08,280
crap. I played something else too. Oh yeah. Um, I'm kind of addicted to video solitary again.

319
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:11,240
That's random. Because like I do it while listening to stuff.

320
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:16,840
Okay. Yeah. So that I can keep my hands busy. Yeah. And I pay better attention to it if I'm,

321
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:21,640
cause I'm a very kinesthetic type of learner. Some people knit or crochet. Some people play

322
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:30,120
video solitaire. It's fine. Yeah. And, um, yeah, that's pretty much it. Oh, wait. I take that back.

323
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:34,040
I take that back. Cause we got the thing. I was about to call you out on something I've been

324
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:38,600
seeing all over Facebook. We got the thing. So after last week's show and that whole talk.

325
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:43,000
I said I wasn't going to actively seek one. A super Nintendo classic is what she's talking

326
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,800
about. Yes, because we have a friend who gave us the hookup as we got our nest mini.

327
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:53,960
So it's not an act of seeking. It's a, Hey, if you get one. Okay. So it fell from the heavens

328
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:59,320
onto your lap. So you were like, if I must, I will take this. Even though there's people everywhere

329
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:03,480
fighting in the streets and on eBay for one of these, somehow one magic, fuck them. They're not

330
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:10,920
me. Somehow one magically fell into your lap and you, you said, okay, if I must, I'll play this

331
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:15,880
Nintendo classic. So we played, um, of course the first thing we played on it was star Fox

332
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:21,080
so that we could unlock star Fox too. Yep. And then Dan beat star Fox too. Oh wow. Yeah. Cause

333
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,680
you can beat that real fast. Yeah, you can different ways, but you have to, you know,

334
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:28,520
go through and prevent like corner area from being destroyed and all this stuff.

335
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:32,680
And I had remembered playing like a ROM way back, but it was more like a level select version. So

336
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:40,040
it was really not very polished rough. Yeah. Um, but I still remembered the level warp trick

337
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:44,760
in the first star Fox where in your second level you go into the asteroid. Oh yeah. You

338
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:50,680
shoot the face. Not quite. You have these rotating. There's, there's five of them. Yeah.

339
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:55,080
And the middle one's gold. You shoot each of those and fly through the, uh, the debris.

340
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:59,960
And then slightly to the left, you're going to get one meteor that has a face on it and you run into

341
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:06,360
it. Right. And it's like a really, it looks like it looks like the moon from Majora's mask. It

342
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:10,920
does. It does look like that. It does. And then you get to do like the skip to like, that's when

343
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:15,320
you go to the black hole, the black hole, and then you go to like sector Y or something. Yeah.

344
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:21,720
One of those sectors anyway. Um, and then, um, we played a Super Mario world last night.

345
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:26,760
Um, a little off and on. I, I'm not as good at that game as I used to be. Although I did like

346
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:32,760
some, you know, just a few things on instinct, you know, like flipping the P block and taking

347
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:40,360
it to the, you know, all that. Um, and, uh, we actually got to like through the whole vanilla

348
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:44,840
dome area, you know, just me and Dan and he's been playing Super Mario Kart, which that game

349
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:51,800
makes me violently ill. Um, why is that just the rough, some of the mode seven games like F zero

350
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:58,280
will do that to me as well. Um, but, um, you know, it's also why I have actually have the same

351
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:03,800
problem with, um, some of the Sonic bonus stages, like the ones where you run and hit the balls.

352
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:09,320
Yeah. Oh, even I get like, oh, stop running back and forth. Yeah. Well, and the, um, and the,

353
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:13,880
the bonus level where you're in like the, the bouncy house with all the blocks and everything.

354
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:18,360
That's my one complaint about Sonic mania is that you run into those bonus stages and like

355
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:21,320
half the game. I mean, you can skip them, but it's like when I was for, you know, you just

356
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:25,720
instinctively keep going into the bonus round. I'm like, all I'm doing is the stupid bonus round.

357
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:29,720
One thing that's a little disappointing is that the ROM for super Mario world is the

358
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:33,480
cartridge ROM and not the all-stars one that had the different Luigi.

359
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,960
Um, and it certainly isn't the Japanese one cause you can't eat the, um, dolphins.

360
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:46,760
Right. But I'm trying to get Dan to set aside some time with me so that we can play through,

361
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:55,080
um, secret mana. Okay. Oh, I also played, um, uh, the, the Kirby all-stars. I just sat down

362
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:59,000
and played the first one until I got, you know, my hands started hurting because I think my

363
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,880
ganglion cyst is coming back and it makes me sad. So, so you're enjoying it despite, and Bobby is

364
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:07,720
saying very tongue in cheek in our chat room. What happened to, I don't need it because I have all

365
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:13,080
the games on it anyway. Because I didn't technically go out and buy it. Dan sent me a picture

366
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:17,240
and said, look what we have, but now that you have it in your house, it was kind of like, oh,

367
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:21,640
this is fun to go back and play all these games again. Well, the thing that I actually specifically

368
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:27,720
like about it is playing it on our 4k TV without lag. Okay. Because we can't hook up. And to be

369
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:31,480
fair, you did call that out last week. It's like the reason why you would want to get one.

370
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:36,120
Exactly. And that I actually don't think I own, um, either of those Kirby games now that I think

371
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:40,840
about it. I don't think that we own those. So it was nice to go back and play a game I haven't

372
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:46,200
touched in, you know, 25 years. So, um, you know, all the rest of them have definitely played more

373
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:51,560
recently than that. Um, shoot, even star Fox two have played more recently than that, but, um, it

374
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:57,960
was, it was neat, you know, um, it's so tiny, it's cute. I took a picture of it on like a real SNES

375
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:02,760
and it was adorable. And, but the thing that is kind of neat is that you, you peel back

376
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:08,840
the controller ports to plug in the little USB controllers. And so that's pretty neat,

377
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:13,800
but I think that the primary thing is just that it makes it easy for some of these games, um,

378
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:19,000
just to play them in the front room where we don't have that, that lag, you know,

379
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,800
imagine trying to play street fighter with at least one to two seconds of lag. Yeah. You can't

380
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:29,400
do it horrible. Yeah. Uh, come on. No Gus in chat is sticking up for you saying a lady can change

381
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:35,880
her mind. It's my prerogative. I can do what I want to do. That's right. Nobody can tell me what

382
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:41,320
to do. And I just quoted Bobby Brown. I know, or, or Brittany, depending on what decade you were

383
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:46,040
growing up in. All right. Uh, well, well, well, Julian, I got to check in with you, buddy. Um,

384
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:49,960
I know you, you play the pirate one Oh one. Is there anything this week that you've been playing

385
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:57,000
specifically? This is like your fave, huh? Um, yeah, I've been playing the game since I, what,

386
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,440
six or seven. Oh, so, Oh, okay. So you've been playing this for like half your life almost.

387
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:09,640
Yeah. Um, I played undertale this week a little. Okay. Um, no.

388
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:18,040
Yeah. Minecraft. We need to get you on danganronpa. What's that? Is that a game that he should play?

389
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:23,080
It's got some themes in it that are a little dark. Well, I, uh, I,

390
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:30,280
Hey, do you know who his mother is? I ain't the parent or the BFF parent. So y'all that's y'all's

391
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:34,760
decision, but okay. No, he probably shouldn't play danganronpa. That's what I thought. All right.

392
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:45,000
I just thought of, um, a great pun. So what, what do you call, um, what was the video game that

393
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,720
everyone is arguing about in the neighborhood? What is the video game that everybody's arguing

394
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:53,240
about in the neighborhood? I don't know what street fighter.

395
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,600
Good night, everybody. We'll be back to do this again in seven days. I hope you all have a

396
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:11,560
wonderful week. You've been listening to orange lounge radio. All right. Anyway, no, it's good.

397
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:15,320
That was good. You're going to go places, kid. It's pretty soon. You're going to have to charge

398
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:19,880
people a two drink minimum. I'm just, I'm just having a Zorak quote going to my head.

399
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,240
Somebody better slap a muzzle on that scale down piece of evil.

400
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:29,480
Okay. I just, I just have a request someday when this show inevitably ends,

401
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:34,120
cause this show is going to have some day. Never. I want Julian to send the show off.

402
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:38,680
That's that's, that's my one. I don't even care if he's like 23,

403
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:43,320
he's got to come back and send the show off appropriately. It's my one request.

404
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:51,160
Fair. Is that deal? I don't know. It's 13 years in the future. It could happen.

405
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:55,880
It could not happen. I could be dead by then, but let's not get morbid kid. All right.

406
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:01,800
I should hope not. I'm sure you're gonna have a long, full life. All right. Anyhow.

407
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:08,600
You all right? No, I just was warning him. Oh yeah. Sorry. The mic doesn't have a lot of slack

408
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:13,000
on it to get all the way over there. So. All right. Anyway. And we're not slackers. Haha.

409
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,280
All right. Uh, let's see. How about Loki? Loki, how was your gaming week? What'd you play?

410
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:21,960
Um, I played cuphead. That was kind of the most of what I played this week.

411
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,760
Is it as hard as advertised? Cause I haven't started it yet.

412
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:29,640
It's not a super hard. Did you sit there and scream at it? Like I just imagine you doing

413
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,680
no, I didn't scream on it because it's just like playing like an old,

414
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:37,000
so you have to understand when people say it's a hard game now it's because they're older and they

415
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,920
they're not as skills. They used to be when they were younger, like playing games from like the

416
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:45,240
eighties. So it's about that difficulty. It's just very technical. So you just,

417
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:49,080
it's not unfair. You just have to be precise in what you do. That's it.

418
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:54,200
I have not played cuphead yet, but I, it is sitting waiting to be streamed after tonight's

419
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:59,880
show me playing for the first time. So gorgeous game. I mean, I really like it. So, um, I haven't

420
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:06,920
played too much of it yet, but I do enjoy it. Um, so definitely worth picking up. Um, then of

421
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:12,920
course I actually went to the store and I saw that they had a Mario Odyssey demo at the kiosk.

422
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:18,280
So I got to try that out. And I got to say that, um, playing the switch with like the joy con

423
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:25,960
separated is the most uncomfortable thing I've had to deal with. I hate that so much. Um,

424
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:30,280
but I think like a pro controller or like it actually docked into the screen or something

425
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:34,040
might be a little bit better, but it was just weird. I just did not like it. It wasn't as

426
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:38,440
comfortable as like the Wii remote in nunchuck. I think it's because they tried to make those so

427
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:43,480
small, but other than that, I mean, Mario honestly is a gorgeous game. I mean, I would

428
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:50,040
love to pick it up, but $400, man, that's pretty expensive. So what three or 400, I don't know,

429
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:53,320
still a few hundred dollars. The games are starting to add up though. Like, you know,

430
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:57,560
the things that are worth buying on the switch, I would think, but yeah, I mean, it's a good,

431
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:03,080
it's a good console, I guess, but like what I really pay all that money for Mario Odyssey,

432
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:09,880
maybe, I don't know. It's just not right now. I don't know. We'll see. We'll see.

433
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:14,520
And then aside from that, just, I've been playing a little bit of the, um,

434
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:20,920
office space idle clicker game, which they keep adding crap to it to make it more kind of grindy

435
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:26,680
and I'm not quite like now I did hit a hundred the other week or whatever. So I'm kind of done

436
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:31,240
with the game, but then they added more to it. So you kind of start all over and then there's like

437
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:34,200
four buildings that you're trying to go through instead of just the one.

438
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:39,320
And I don't know. It just seems very like cash grab. It's a free to play game. So it's supposed

439
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:45,720
to be very obvious cash grab, but it's just kind of like each week let's find ways to screw the

440
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:50,280
player over even more. It's I don't know. It's just kind of, I'm not playing it as much. I'm

441
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:55,080
kind of going that route. They went with Pokemon and Ingress where it's like kind of slowly phasing

442
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:59,960
it out. Okay. We'll see. All right. That's it. All right. Well, my gaming week, I haven't,

443
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:04,520
I haven't played an awful lot because I guess, I guess I can confess about this on the show.

444
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:07,480
I haven't done, I haven't done one of these games in like eight or nine years,

445
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:11,240
but one of my friends from back in the day, like was it tried to convince me like, Hey Rob,

446
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:15,880
you should play my game. That's like one of these like online, like big brother type of competitions,

447
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:20,360
like the TV show, but it's all on Facebook. So, and before you judge me for this type of stuff,

448
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:25,160
like it's no different than like role-playing on forums or anything like that. Live journal.

449
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,800
Yeah. I was doing this back in the day. That was the last time I did it was back in,

450
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:31,720
back in the day when live was still around. So one of my friends that I met in those days was like,

451
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:35,800
he, he'd been bugging me about it for a while, but I was like, no, I can't do it because I'm doing

452
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:39,400
four podcasts a week. No, I can't do it cause I'm doing two podcasts a week. And now it's like,

453
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:44,360
Oh, I guess I only have the one show. So as long as nothing big happens on Sundays, I guess I can

454
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:49,400
do it. So, so that's been taken a lot of my time though, because that's a very, you know, social

455
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:53,640
type of thing where you have to talk to a lot of people. So, uh, yeah, that's, that's been taking

456
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:58,600
up a lot of my time, but I have been trying to do a few video games here and there and namely the

457
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:03,800
super Nintendo classic. Of course, I finally had to plug that in and play that getting that Friday.

458
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:10,040
So like Jamie, the first thing I did was play star Fox so I could unlock star Fox too. And, uh, when

459
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:15,640
I played star Fox too, I have to admit, I was kind of like, man, it's really not that good.

460
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:21,240
Yeah. That's kind of what I was looking at. I was like, the Walker areas are bizarre. Here's

461
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:26,680
the thing. Here's the thing. If that game had come out at that time, it would have been awesome.

462
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:34,520
But the technology with the FX chip and that type of 3d gaming, it hasn't aged gracefully. You know,

463
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:40,840
it's still very polygon and you really notice like the low frame rate on these games. And look,

464
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:45,640
I'm not, I'm not raising it because. You know, that was what it was in the nineties. And at

465
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:50,680
that time it blew our minds because we hadn't seen anything like it, but it just, I actually

466
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:57,960
would argue that something like super Mario cart has aged better than star Fox has. I think

467
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:02,520
I do like the dogfight levels though. Those were pretty neat. Yeah. It was kind of one of the

468
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:07,240
things I'd always wanted in star Fox from the get-go, uh, dark Tetsuya and Chad over at live.vog

469
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:12,040
network.com says seems like most reviewers are comparing it to today's games. Yeah. I heard

470
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:17,160
about that. Like some big website gave it a five out of 10 and stuff. I don't, I just, I'm not sure

471
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:25,960
star Fox two can be reviewed appropriately today. Like it's a brand new game in 2017. I mean,

472
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:30,520
it's a bone to why it's necessary to review the game, but that's what I'm saying is that,

473
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:35,080
well, you can, I think it's fine to do like a review. Well, I'm if it's your website,

474
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:39,560
you do whatever the heck you want, but I would think like if it's, if it was for vog network,

475
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:44,920
let's say, I think I would just do an unscored review, like an impressions type of thing. And

476
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:50,200
you know, this is how I feel about star Fox two in 2017. It's cool that I got to play it.

477
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:54,600
It's cool that they unearthed something out of the archive. I wish Nintendo would do this more

478
00:43:54,600 --> 00:44:01,080
often, but that all being said, this is a great thing for a museum, but not something I'm going

479
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:05,480
to be like, Oh, I got to run home and play star Fox two. I think we also have to look at it though,

480
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:11,400
through the lens of, you know, what it was built for the time it was built for. Yeah,

481
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:17,400
no. And like I'm saying, like as a, as a museum, as a study of the super Nintendo back in the day,

482
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:22,840
as a, what essentially would have been one of the final releases on the super Nintendo,

483
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:28,520
you know, it's, I'm great that it exists for people to see that, but like as a, this is going

484
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:33,960
to be my 40 hours of entertainment this week, instead of playing final fantasy 15 or something,

485
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:40,200
probably not. So I don't know. That's how I feel about it. Anyway, uh, SSG100 Matt and chat over

486
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:44,920
at live.vognetware.com says, seems like society feels the need to tear down and pick apart

487
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:50,120
everything. Doesn't matter what it is. Yeah. I mean, I can sit here and go star Fox two

488
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:54,760
isn't that great. It didn't age well, but I can still respect it for what it was trying to do

489
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:58,600
at the time and what it means to the super Nintendo. And I think the elements from that

490
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:04,200
went into the star Fox assault. Yeah. There are pieces of that that influenced future star Fox

491
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:08,040
games for sure. That's what I like about it though. But I'm really hoping that beta 64 does

492
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:14,200
a new video about it, where they go through, um, that semi pre-released one that was online,

493
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:19,400
that wasn't translated and do a comparison to see how complete it was. Now I'm kind of sitting and

494
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:24,360
purposely waiting to dive into final fantasy three and secret of mana, because I think those would

495
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:28,360
make better streams. So I'm kind of waiting to do some streams of those, but I have been trying to

496
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:34,520
play some of the other games. Uh, I played street fighter two turbo and, uh, is it like, I can't

497
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:39,640
do any of the moves. Like what happened? Like I'm, I'm in the game trying to do like Chun-Li

498
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:44,440
kick, kick, kick, or, or she can throw a fireball in this one. Right. No, she doesn't have the key

499
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:49,080
close show in this one. I thought she got that in turbo. No. Yeah. She got it in, um, super.

500
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:53,160
Oh, she got in super. No wonder I couldn't do the fireball, but I couldn't even do the spinning

501
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:57,080
bird kick or any of that stuff. And I was like, what? And then I switched over to Ryu and I was

502
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:01,560
able to throw a fireball, but like I couldn't do anything else. It was like, I know how to do the

503
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:07,240
moves. It's like, what happened? I got to the end with, um, Ken and he couldn't beat him with Ken.

504
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:12,360
So he switched to Ryu and beat the game, but Ryu wasn't there because the fight is everything.

505
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:16,760
I wasn't, wait a minute. But Ryu and Ken are practically the same. Um, speed is a little

506
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:22,200
different. Yeah. I get, and, and I think Ken gets a little more on the Shoryuken and Ryu gets a

507
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:26,120
little more on the fireball. Right. Yeah. And I think he's got a better throw. I think that's

508
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:30,760
the other thing too. He's got a stronger throw. I guess that's true. So, all right. Yeah. Uh,

509
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:35,160
okay. Thank you. Dark Tetsuya says she has it in turbo. It's a different motion though.

510
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:38,600
That's what I thought. She had like the tiny little fireball and then they like really

511
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:43,480
changed the look of it. I thought it was a charge move. I can't remember. I thought you

512
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:47,160
had to roll a half circle. No, I thought hers was a charge move. I thought it was a half circle.

513
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:51,400
Any, well, any, whatever it is, I tried both and I can't do it. And I was like,

514
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:56,840
is this just cause I'm old? Like what's going on? You can always check the manual. Do they have a

515
00:46:56,840 --> 00:47:01,720
manual in the game or is it a link online? We also have this other thing called the internet

516
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:07,560
or game facts or, you know, probably just ask Siri, you know, Hey Siri, how do I throw a

517
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:13,720
fireball? Take some gasoline in a match and some cotton balls. Uh, Dark Tetsuya in chat says it

518
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:18,760
was a charge motion in super street fighter two. So, uh, that's always how I was used to doing it.

519
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:22,040
Yeah. That's why I was used to it too, but that's cause they changed it later. But anyway,

520
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:27,640
all that stuff aside. Oh yes. Um, I know how to do the, um, fireball. So what you do is you take

521
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:36,280
the controller and press some buttons in a certain order and it will work. Thanks kid. I'll try that

522
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:43,880
later on. Cause it's not working for me so far. All right. That's it. I'm going to challenge the

523
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:48,120
boy to street fighter. That's right. You should, you should school, you should school this kid on

524
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:53,080
street fighter and then we'll see. We'll see what he has to say next week. Oh, Julia's played

525
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:59,320
strip. Who's your favorite in street fighter. Julia. Who's that character that can do the

526
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:06,520
fireball, but all has the weird stretchy limbs. I think you're thinking of, um, um, I know a lot

527
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:10,760
of people that are terrible playing him. He's my best character. All right, cool. It's all seems

528
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:16,360
cool. Like yoga, fire yoga, that guy. Right. Yoga flame. I think, I think it's, um, isn't her name

529
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:26,680
Chung Lee. Um, um, she's, I'm also, I'm gonna, um, playing on her, but I, do you know what the

530
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:33,960
most popular move in treat fighter is? What's that? Hadouken. Yes it is. Yes. I think everybody

531
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:38,360
knows. I think Hadouken is probably in the Webster dictionary at this point. Very well. I'm curious.

532
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:42,600
I'm going to look that up. All right. Well, while you look that up, cheap bitch move. All right.

533
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:48,760
We need to get to, uh, some quick announcements. Follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R.

534
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:55,080
We're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio. Uh, we'll be here for the next few

535
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:59,720
weeks. We might be off in early November. I'll fill you guys all in on that. Hopefully I'll know

536
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:05,240
that for sure in the next two weeks. Can we fill it in with cream? Whatever. Like when you have a

537
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:09,560
night off custard cream, you can spend it. However you like, you can bake with Becky. She's next.

538
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:15,880
I can't bake for shit. That's why I have Becky because Becky can bake for shit and she can bake

539
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:23,240
for other things too. Fair enough. Fair enough. All right. Let's get stuff though. Let's get to

540
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:28,680
some gaming news. We got more to dump. Jump into Loki. Well, it's a little bicep with Jamie. It

541
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:33,240
just doesn't have the same ring to it as big with Beth. It really doesn't. It really doesn't.

542
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:38,120
Um, I could do a shopping show since we were talking about street fighter. Um,

543
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:43,720
I guess you guys should know that street fighter five is getting an arcade edition. Yes. It's

544
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:48,840
coming out January 16th on PlayStation four and PC. Now what is this going to be? Well,

545
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:54,760
it's 39 99 and includes an arcade mode. Pretty straightforward since it is arcade edition,

546
00:49:55,400 --> 00:50:01,880
extra battle mode, some V trigger moves, uh, gallery and new user interface and seasons one

547
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:06,760
and two DLC content. I don't care if Sakura is not playable. So this is the game of the

548
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:13,400
year edition basically. Am I, am I right? It's a game this year or next year. Oh yeah. I guess,

549
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:16,920
I guess street fighter five can't really call itself the game of the year. They can just call

550
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:24,120
it a game from the game we release and now we're releasing this other edition that's got stuff in

551
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:30,520
it. It's the, you tried collection. I don't care if Sakura is not playable. It's just buy this one

552
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:35,080
so you don't have to buy all the extra DLC cause you know the one that you should have waited for

553
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:40,120
the buy until they released the ultimate arcade edition or whatever bullshit. Am I not, am I not

554
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:45,240
mistaken that in the very beginning they said when they first put out street fighter five,

555
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:51,160
Oh, we're not going to do those types of collections because you know, this is it.

556
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:55,000
This is the definitive street fighter five and we want it to be, you know, something that,

557
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,840
you know, we add on to, I don't know, whatever the line was, they gave us a few months ago

558
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:02,440
that we all knew fit in a version of street fighter five except none of the characters

559
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:06,040
are out. So we're going to have to keep releasing those as we go on. So it'll be the,

560
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:15,960
it'll be as definitive as the last piece of DLC. Um, uh, do you think, uh, what's going to happen

561
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:19,720
to the people that already own street fighter five? Are they gonna, they get an update I

562
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:24,440
believe. Okay. So they get like, so you get, if you, you own street fighter five, you get

563
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:29,800
everything except for the DLC cause that you have to buy. Okay. Act deft and check,

564
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:34,360
correcting me a little bit here saying they said that they were not going to do different versions

565
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:39,160
of street fighter five, which is true. We're not getting a different version. So he's,

566
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:45,160
he meaning like it's a different edition. It's not street fighter five ultra or turbo or super ultra

567
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:53,000
turbo max for dancing stage. Yes. All right. True kiss destination. Time for that. I think

568
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:56,440
you're looking for for matching service for matching service. That's what I was trying

569
00:51:56,440 --> 00:52:00,680
to think of. All right. Uh, Julian, you get to pick up street fighter five. Um,

570
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:09,400
I have no idea, but, um, so when I, when I play against someone in street fighter,

571
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:20,440
which is usually my family members, um, I hate when people spam the same attack over and over

572
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:25,720
and over again, like someone goes up to you and says, how do we can, how do we can, and then you

573
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:31,560
cannot get to them because the little, um, timer of where you can't move after the attack, they

574
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:37,320
just keep doing it. And it's so annoying when they just spam an attack. And that is why I said that

575
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:42,600
was the cheap bitch move. I was going to say, I didn't know if I could, if I should say that in

576
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:47,880
front of a 10 year old, but, but sometimes we call that being a little bitch and people should stop

577
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:55,800
doing that. Yeah. Remember the rule for fighting games. Don't be that bitch. Let's see. How dare

578
00:52:55,800 --> 00:53:02,840
you? How dare you in chat room? There's people in chat room going, Julian, get good. You have

579
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:09,160
anything to say to that Julian? Get good Julian. What do they mean by that? They mean you just,

580
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:12,520
you got to try harder. You got to get better at the game so you can get around that stuff.

581
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:22,520
Um, I, um, say to that, let me do what I want in video game is so shut up.

582
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:29,000
Get this boy a Twitter account. All right.

583
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:35,960
Well said actually. And actually some of the people that were saying that, which by the way

584
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:40,600
was tongue in cheek, they didn't really mean it. They say, well said, well said, Julian, well said.

585
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:46,120
All right. All right. Moving on. Let's talk about Pokemon. Uh, we're gonna talk about Pokemon ultra

586
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:51,400
sun and ultra moon, which got a little more information this week. Do the kids like Pokemon

587
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:54,520
Julian? I'm surprised you didn't bring that up. I thought kids love Pokemon.

588
00:53:55,880 --> 00:54:03,000
He's making a face. No one plays Pokemon anymore. Um, not so much at school, but when I still,

589
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:09,240
when I went to daycare two days ago, um, I stopped going to daycare two days ago.

590
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:16,760
So, um, um, um, every single day, um, sort of bring their Pokemon cards and say,

591
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:20,280
did you get a new mega yet today or something like that? Or go like,

592
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:24,040
Hey, did you bring your Pokemon cards? You didn't bring your Pokemon cards. I,

593
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:29,720
you said we'd have a battle today. And, um, those kids sound like nerds.

594
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:35,720
Oh, aren't all of us.

595
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:41,240
Yes. Especially the people listening to this show. Right. Julian probably.

596
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:44,440
And they're bored.

597
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:55,880
But, um, I do have Pokemon moon. I don't have Pokemon ultra mega ex moon.

598
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:58,040
Well, no one does yet. It's coming out soon.

599
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:05,240
Um, I have Pokemon moon. I also know, um, some people that have sun and moon, but

600
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:11,880
there's only two people, um, that, um, when that went to the daycare that, um, had, um,

601
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:22,120
uh, the new Pokemon, which was me and, um, Ethan C I know five Ethan's Ethan C Ethan T Ethan P.

602
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:31,640
Um, um, um, Ethan Yee, Ethan B. You're just, you're just throwing letters out there. These

603
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:39,240
people don't exist. So if anyone's curious, Ethan is the common name for this particular.

604
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:43,960
I know a ton of mats. I know, like I'll have, I know a ton of friends. I have some friends

605
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:47,800
that are named Matt. That's why we call this one Loki. So we can tell them apart from the other

606
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:53,160
mats. So, you know, maybe you need to come up with other nicknames for your Ethan's,

607
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:55,560
but I mean, if you want to use their last initial, I guess that works too.

608
00:55:56,120 --> 00:56:05,560
So to prove that they exist, Ethan, um, B's last name is we don't give out people's names on the

609
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:10,680
show. We don't like to give out because we don't want anyone to find out are creepy.

610
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:13,480
We don't want them to get new friends that they don't want.

611
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:15,320
Exactly. Exactly.

612
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:22,520
Don't be creepy and stop buying your ads into other people's business, please.

613
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:26,360
Thank you. Yeah, that's not going to work. Listen to the kid. All right. Well, anyhow,

614
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:32,200
what can you expect in Pokemon ultra sun and ultra moon? There will be new ultra beasts

615
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:40,280
with the beast wise from your grave. Uh, there will be a new ultra beast that will have the

616
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:45,800
ability to travel through ultra wormholes to go beyond just Alola. And that's what I,

617
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:48,840
that's what I thought was weird. When I started seeing all the promotion for this game, I was

618
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:52,680
like, what happened to like the Hawaii thing? Like Alola was basically Hawaii, right? I was like,

619
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:56,440
what happened to the Hawaii thing? And now I'm looking at all the graphics and I'm like, well,

620
00:56:57,080 --> 00:57:02,600
it does look kind of cool because it kind of looks like Tron now. Like they got like,

621
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:07,640
Pokemon got all warped to Tron world. So I might be here for that. So anyway,

622
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:12,840
it all is going to focus around the Pokemon necro. I'm probably gonna mispronounce this name.

623
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:17,560
Necrozma is the Pokemon. That's kind of the centerpiece of the story. Um,

624
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:26,360
who, uh, has taken over a legendary Pokemon, Solgaleo and Lunala. And, uh, so no, not Ulala,

625
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:31,960
that's different, but anyway, uh, Necrozma has different forms called dusk main Necrozma and

626
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:37,960
Dawn wings Necrozma. And so ultra beasts can be battled on their home turf. What is this? A

627
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:43,000
square Enix game? I know, right. Actually the way the plot gets all complicated, it kind of does

628
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,840
like, I was like, what's this? Kingdom hearts. I was like, Pokemon need like a kingdom hearts guy

629
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:51,720
in the kingdom hearts territory with all these weird names and like versions. But Kingdom hearts

630
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:55,160
is one of those games where it's like, I don't understand it. Even though this game is for

631
00:57:55,160 --> 00:58:00,680
children, we're really missing these at the end of the title, you know, it's, you know, we need a

632
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:09,080
random fraction number. Oh, Pokemon ultra sun, moon one, three 65 days. True kiss destination

633
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:17,080
for a matching remix. Yeah. With knuckles. Yes. And knuckles and tails. All right. Anyhow,

634
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:21,560
uh, Pokemon, I I'll still check it out even, even though I'm kind of making fun of it very

635
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:26,840
tongue in cheek, it's like, ah, it's Pokemon and it's Tron ish. So I'm on board. Poketron.

636
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:34,920
Yes. Poketron. Exactly. Dark Sakura. What do you have for us? Um, I have things that should be a

637
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:43,720
big fat duh, but it's not duh because we have assholes in the world. Um, Bethesda had a, uh,

638
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:49,160
for their Wolfenstein production, uh, not production, but promotion or, uh, using

639
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:55,160
make America Nazi free again with the hashtag no more Nazis, which should be fine. Except people

640
00:58:55,160 --> 00:59:01,480
actually took offense to it. Like, Oh, they're all SJW men. We're not going to do that anymore.

641
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:09,080
Like, why is it a bad thing to tell Nazis to fuck off? I was like, since, since when was Wolfenstein

642
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:17,480
not about eliminating Nazis and fighting Hitler. That's why people played Wolfenstein 3d,

643
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:23,800
because you got to fight Hitler and you got to punch him in the face with rockets and stuff.

644
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:30,360
And so always punch Nazis. So I'm not sure why. I mean, that's just a kind of a sick sign of,

645
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:35,080
I think the times we live in, in some ways that now all of a sudden it's like, Oh, what this like,

646
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:40,840
okay, look, if you're going to take issue with the game because it's violent. Okay. That's one thing,

647
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:48,120
but just like, there's a quote here. That's not what I'm hearing is, is the issue. These,

648
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:53,160
these Twitter ultra beasts are, uh, for lack of a better term are coming up with, there's a quote

649
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:59,240
here that I like, um, from Pete Hines, who's the vice president of marketing and PR is basically

650
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:05,160
supporting their campaign saying Wolfenstein has been a decidedly anti-Nazi series since the first

651
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:09,640
release more than 20 years ago. We aren't going to shy away from what the game is about. We don't

652
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:14,200
feel it's a reach for us to say Nazis are bad and un-American. And we're not worried about being on

653
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:19,800
the right side of history here. There's definitely some tongue and cheekness to the advertising

654
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:24,520
that's going on though, and playing into what's going on in the real world. And the other thing

655
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:29,400
is that they said it was pretty much a coincidence that Wolfenstein II the new Colossus was a

656
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:35,320
coincidence because no one really expected to have real life Nazis marching in the streets, you know?

657
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:48,120
So at the same time, I think that it's, we shouldn't have to, no, just stop. All of you stop.

658
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:53,640
You're terrible. Nintendo is allowing a Wolfenstein game on their system.

659
01:00:54,520 --> 01:01:03,320
Nintendo is fine with it. So I think that says a lot right there. Oh my God. But I like this quote,

660
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:09,960
when it comes to Nazis, you can put us down in the against column. I think that's a very... As

661
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:15,480
everyone should be. It's kind of, it's, what does it say that like a video game company has to come

662
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:21,720
out and say that, and that there's a lot of people that are like, why yes, that is something

663
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:27,880
I support. No shit that you support that, but yet you have to come out and say that. And so

664
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:34,600
it kind of blows my mind. It's just terrible. I mean, do you not remember that these are people

665
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:42,040
who killed 10 million plus people all because they didn't fit into their little white blonde

666
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:47,560
category, right? Remember that? No, you don't, because your grandparents were busy fighting

667
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:54,920
against that. So fuck off and die. I'm sorry, if you're a Nazi, fuck off and die. All right.

668
01:01:55,720 --> 01:02:01,080
In that order, because the fucking off part is important. Thank you for clarifying. All right,

669
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:07,720
let's move on. Something a little bit more... Less Nazi. Yeah, less Nazi. Loki. I wouldn't say

670
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:13,160
they're less Nazis because they sure as have a Nazi policy when it comes to cross-platform play,

671
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:19,240
but knock it off. Hey, that's my transition. Don't you fuck it up. Fine. Anyways, so PlayStation

672
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:26,600
4 had their 5.0 firmware come out and what did it do? I'm sure totally exciting things. Well,

673
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:33,320
somewhat exciting things, I guess. So for example, they had, now you can, if you have a PlayStation

674
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:39,560
4 Pro, you can stream in 1080p and 60 FPS. Of course, with that, they kind of tweak the way

675
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:44,280
that they are doing their accounts. So you can have accounts marked as like children accounts,

676
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:49,880
and you can have adults that can basically include different parental controls for each account

677
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:55,000
and more managing the way those family accounts are handled. Also, they are saying that they've

678
01:02:55,000 --> 01:03:01,880
included some improvements to the suspend resume as well as uploading clips to Twitter.

679
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:07,480
And you can broadcast to YouTube and they also add folders and that type of stuff.

680
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:14,200
So that's cool, I guess. I haven't been in my PlayStation 4 for a while, so I haven't actually

681
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:21,160
gotten to try that out yet. Now, this is another thing that I was kind of, well, not upset,

682
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:25,240
but I was just like, oh man, you know, I kind of knew this was going to happen, but there's going

683
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:30,840
to be some tweaks coming to the PlayStation VR hardware. So they are releasing a different

684
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:36,280
processor unit, which is basically, it's not the headset itself, it's more of the box that

685
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:44,120
basically is in between the PlayStation 4 and your headset. So what it does now, because one of the

686
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:50,200
issues was that they weren't able to pass through an HDR signal through the box. You had to kind of

687
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:54,200
unhook it and hook it back up or do like a splitter or something like that in order to get

688
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:59,640
to work. Well, now the new box actually includes an HDMI pass through for the HDR.

689
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:05,240
So that's kind of neat. And then of course, also now they're tweaking the headset slightly to

690
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:11,560
add the headfoot integration directly into the headset versus like separate.

691
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:17,800
So if I wait to buy the VR headset till this Christmas or whatever holiday, it sounds like

692
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:21,720
there's going to be less crap because that's one thing that annoyed me about the VR headset is

693
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:27,000
there's all this stuff. Like it's like my, my house is a mess already. I don't need more cords.

694
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:32,280
It's it's not so, I mean, I don't know. It basically, they're saying that it's,

695
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:37,240
it's just, you know, a little bit, a little bit more cleaned up. It's not like a huge

696
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:42,120
improvement. I don't think it's just an improvement. It's in yes. Okay. I'll take it.

697
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:45,320
I'll take it. And I don't want to, I don't want to sound ridiculous that like, I'm going to let

698
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:49,240
a few cords stop me from getting into VR, but it certainly has been a thing where I've kind of

699
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:55,400
looked at it and gone, that's going to be a lot to store. Honestly, the integration with the heads

700
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:59,880
headphones right now is not a huge deal because like they have it. It's on the court, but yeah,

701
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:04,440
it does get a little bit tangled. I guess if you're taking the headset on and off,

702
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:08,920
it is better than if it's just plugged straight in the headset versus the cord that's attached

703
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:15,400
to the headset. So I mean, I guess that's nice, but it's, I don't know. I don't feel the need.

704
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:18,760
Like I don't need to sell mine and like buy a new one or something like that.

705
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:24,440
Okay. All right. All right. Well, moving on to talk about discord. I don't know if you guys

706
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:30,440
are using discord. You should be because a VoG network has a discord and we use that to keep in

707
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:33,880
touch with our listeners throughout the week. You can even submit stories. Some of the stories on

708
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:38,760
tonight's show were submitted by people on our discord. And, you know, I, I don't see Loki and

709
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:42,520
Jamie on there a lot, but I try to get on there and I actually respond to stuff. So, and so forth.

710
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:45,560
You can kind of chat with us throughout the week. It's kind of, kind of what we have instead

711
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:50,120
of forums now. I mean, yes, there are forums, but people actually are using discord. So you

712
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:54,680
can check that out over at vognetwork.com slash discord, uh, that, that will get you,

713
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:58,440
you're invited pops you right over into the discord. But anyway, the reason why I bring

714
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:03,240
up discord is not just the cheap plug, but the fact that discord is rolling out more features.

715
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:09,240
In fact, what's happening now is that the, uh, video chat is now available to everybody.

716
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:15,160
So you can do video chat in one-to-one calls or with up to 10 people in a direct messaging group,

717
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:20,040
you can switch between your webcam video and screen share. So that's pretty cool.

718
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:24,200
I think that's going to be a great thing too for Twitch broadcasters is that if you wanted to do

719
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:29,160
like a broadcast with several other people and maybe actually be able to show their screens

720
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:32,760
when they play and so forth, it sounds like discord may be a really great way to do that.

721
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:37,240
I think a lot of people are probably accomplishing that through Skype right now. I know we use Skype

722
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:41,400
video chat a lot for the game I'm playing right now. Uh, but that's cool that discord has that as

723
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:46,280
well. Uh, also picture and picture support is going to be available with that. And they're

724
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:53,400
saying that discord has 45 million users and counting. Uh, and I would assume a lot of the

725
01:06:53,400 --> 01:07:00,840
boom for discord has come from, uh, in part, uh, Nintendo's lack of a robust online option,

726
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:05,480
causing people to look for alternatives and things like Pokemon go. I think discord has

727
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:10,680
been huge for Pokemon go has got a lot of people on that. Uh, and then like MMOs in general,

728
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:14,120
you know, I remember when you used to have to rent a team speak server,

729
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:17,800
but you don't have to do that anymore with discord. It's all kind of free. So I'm sure

730
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:24,520
MMOs and discord are huge and a big part of what's driving that as well. So, uh,

731
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:30,600
act deft and chat points out my two reasons for joining discord vog and splatoon team chat. Yes.

732
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:36,200
You can actually, uh, uh, do sometimes like when Flaco streaming, uh, I know I joined one of the

733
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:39,800
streams and he was in the vog channel on discord and you can actually join his game and talk to

734
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:43,320
him and interact with the stream, right. As it's going on. So I thought that was really cool.

735
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:47,480
So anyway, uh, yeah, discord is very cool. And I think it's great that they have video coming out

736
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:51,240
for that. Why would you need to do that? Cause then tinder has its own dedicated app. Isn't

737
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:59,320
that good enough? Uh, no, it's not good enough. That's my short answer. Dark Sakura. Well,

738
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:03,480
you know, I was saying earlier that I have cuphead and I really want to play it,

739
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:08,360
but of course the speed runners have already attacked the game with full force. Um,

740
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:15,720
and we now have a person who is 16 out of the top 20, um, cuphead speed runners,

741
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:21,720
except the speed runner named Goopy Legrand. Wait, not Goopy Legrand. Why did I say that?

742
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:26,920
That's one of the bosses. Oh no, I believed you. It was peeking boo. Sorry.

743
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:32,280
Because I knew it was a similarly ridiculous name. Are you sure that's not a boss name too?

744
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:43,160
But peeking boo beat the game with DDR pads, quite literally an arcade dance pad hooked up to a PC

745
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:50,040
and playing it with dance pads. And apparently this person has speed run other games this way,

746
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:56,520
but it was more or less, will the game stand up to the challenge? And yes, it did, uh,

747
01:08:56,520 --> 01:09:02,680
beat the game in one hour, 24 minutes and 40 seconds. Um, the entire run is actually posted,

748
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:07,960
excuse me, posted online as well. Um, but there were, there were a few bosses that gave some

749
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:14,920
trouble, but for the most part, everyone and the final boss defeated with the dance pad.

750
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:21,640
That's impressive. That's impressive. So now, um, uh, his goal is to try to do it in under an hour.

751
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:24,440
Okay. You got any better? Julian, what'd you want to say about that? Um,

752
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:28,680
speaking of speed runs, there was someone who sped around the game,

753
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:33,800
dark souls with a guitar hero controller. This, this is a crazy thing people do. Do you,

754
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:38,920
do you like watching that stuff or do you think it's weird? I don't actually watch it. I just

755
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:45,560
look up top 10 videos on this, so I don't have to watch the whole two hour video. You just want to

756
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:50,040
see the summary. You just show me the bullet points is what you're saying. Yeah. That's what

757
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:53,400
I thought. That's what I thought. All right, Julian's going to be running his own company.

758
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:59,320
So we introduced the boy to rod caliber, but you play soul caliber with a fishing rod.

759
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:05,000
It's as dumb as it sounds. Julie and it really is. She always talks about it. It's pretty dumb.

760
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:12,120
I don't even know what that game is, but it's like street fighter, but if it's a video game,

761
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:17,720
you can't play with a fishing rod cause it's not a video game controller. That's what you think.

762
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:26,440
That's what you think on the dreamcast. They released a fishing rod controller for playing

763
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:33,640
get bass or as it was in the U S Sega bass fishing and that game is stupidly fun.

764
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:41,480
If I'm not mistaken, you could also play crazy taxi with the rod. You can play crazy taxi with

765
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:44,440
fishing rod. You can make some crazy money with a fishing rod.

766
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:53,240
Why did they make a fishing rod controller?

767
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:01,240
Rob has turned fuchsia again.

768
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:13,640
It's because back then, you know, they couldn't really improve games by, you know,

769
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:16,520
quality. So they added all these funny little controllers.

770
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:22,280
Julian, why they have the power glove. I have one. I think I have two.

771
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:29,240
We are going to school you in the dreamcast. You're going to sit down and you're going to

772
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:35,800
play sea man and you're going to talk to a fish. This sounds like Leonard Nimoy because it was

773
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:41,080
voiced by Leonard Nimoy. The nineties were a very interesting time, especially at the end.

774
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:45,400
What also killed me was Alan and you guys couldn't hear Alan shouting from the kitchen.

775
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:52,360
Hope that two weeks and no TV was worth it. I think Julian knows his audience.

776
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:55,000
He does. Yes. Julie's Julie knows audience. All right.

777
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:59,000
Okay. Let's move on.

778
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:10,520
So, uh, super Mario Odyssey, like most of the other Nintendo games that are on the switch

779
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:15,640
and other platforms, they of course have amiibo support. And one of the worries I always think

780
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:19,880
with some of these is that, Oh, look, here's another feature. It's basically locked behind

781
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:26,120
some garbage that I got to buy. So what's kind of neat though with this, I guess not neat, but

782
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:34,280
a fair use of it is it's not necessarily required, but you can do it. You can basically use it to

783
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:39,720
unlock outfits in the game, but you can also purchase those outfits in the game using the

784
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:45,800
in-game money within there that you earn not with real money. So, but if you want to unlock them

785
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:51,560
quicker than you can use the amiibos and do it that way. So at least it's not required. So it's

786
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:58,280
a neat bonus, but it's not required. Kind of like whole Skyrim thing. You don't need the Zelda amiibos

787
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:02,360
to unlock. You can to unlock it quicker, but you can also find that stuff in game.

788
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:06,120
Now you haven't always been the kindest when it comes to amiibo. So I bet this is,

789
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:08,840
this is a trend you're probably kind of liking. Aren't you low key?

790
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:16,520
Um, it's, I like that it's not required because that would just be dumb. Um,

791
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:20,200
but then at the same time, it's like, okay, then what's the real point then? I guess it's just

792
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:25,960
collecting them because they look neat. And then it sort of adds a feature to the game,

793
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:30,200
but not really because you can do it without it. So what's the point?

794
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:36,360
All right. Uh, moving on before I move on to the next story, uh, dark soccer, did you want to,

795
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:39,880
for the sake of our podcast listeners, did you want to repeat the disclaimer you're giving

796
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:44,200
in chat right now? We're writing language. Yes. So, uh, and this is actually kind of in

797
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:49,320
response to Brad, but before the email, damn it, Julian, I just spit water out of my nose

798
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:53,400
or threw in his best F bomb ever. And I said, his mom's laughing her ass off.

799
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:58,840
Becky's one of those people that realizes a word is a fucking word. Julian knows not to say that

800
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:04,440
Oh, at church. Like he wouldn't combust the moment he steps foot in one. Yeah. Don't, don't ever say

801
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:11,960
that at daycare. They're not going to like it there. All right. All right. Anyway. And active

802
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:16,760
says, uh, yeah, I was going to say that he knows what the word can mean and how it can be offensive.

803
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:28,120
There you go. Do we care? Oh, yes, please. I don't know why she handed me the mic.

804
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:33,000
Because you look like you're going to say something clever, but clearly not.

805
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:37,800
All right. Well, I got Julian and I just look ready all the time. All right. I got

806
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:41,320
to say he's just, he's just adaptable. Ready to go. All right. He is adaptable.

807
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:45,720
I got something that, uh, uh, may make you exclaim all sorts of words. Uh, this,

808
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:51,640
this sounds like it could be really cool though. Uh, Nintendo apparently has, uh, done a Game Boy

809
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:57,080
image trademark and, uh, you know, they want to trademark what a Game Boy looks like. They want

810
01:14:57,080 --> 01:15:05,800
to do that for merchandising purposes, but, but there's also a trademark here for use as a

811
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:14,040
storage medium, as in you, they want to be able to put one of those out there and say,

812
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:24,360
have 30 of the best games preloaded already on it, including I'm sure. How is Tetris not going

813
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:28,920
to be? I don't know. Would they have the license? I need revenge of the gator. Yeah. Right. Well,

814
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:33,400
anyway, so I think we all see where this is going is going to be Tetris, Arkanoid,

815
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:41,080
Super Mario land. It wasn't Arkanoid. It was alleyway to the, the Egyptian Mario,

816
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:48,200
Mario land, that whole thing. Yeah. And, uh, the, the weird link game, the links awakening.

817
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:52,040
Oh, for sure. It'd be Game Boy color. I would imagine they would do the Game Boy color stuff.

818
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:58,520
Oh, Pokemon. Oh man, that, that alone is going to be hot cakes for that. So why don't they

819
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:01,800
would have like integration. That'd be kind of cool. Like with those older games, if they'd

820
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:07,560
have integration with like the, you know, with the Pokemon bank and all that. Yeah. Well, see,

821
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:13,000
the interesting thing is because now we're getting into stuff that is on virtual console because of

822
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:20,520
three D S right. So, um, meaning that like Pokemon yellow, you can download that and you can actually

823
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:24,600
play that on your three D S Oh, Julian is bringing me cake. You're the man. Thank you so

824
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:32,200
much, dude. All right. So, um, uh, you can, and you can, it actually does connect to the Pokemon bank.

825
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:35,960
So you can already do that with the three D S virtual console. I don't know if this would

826
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:40,760
necessarily be able to do that. It would be very cool if Nintendo did do that, but let's just say,

827
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:47,560
I'm not going to hold my breath. Yeah. I doubt it. Yeah. But, uh, yeah. So it seems like, uh,

828
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:53,880
instead of the N 64 classic, most people are assuming would be the next logical progression

829
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:59,240
from Nintendo to super Nintendo. You know, it seems like game boy is going to be the next

830
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:05,480
classic for next year. Probably. It's not, it's not a bad idea. It's really not a bad idea.

831
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:14,200
So, yeah. All right. Well, anyhow, uh, speaking of classics and speaking of systems,

832
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:18,520
I think it's time for the classic system of the month.

833
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:25,480
And you might be thinking, didn't we just do this last week? Well told people. Yes,

834
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:31,080
but it was a makeup session. So now we're getting to October's. Y'all need to listen. Well,

835
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:36,680
I just, sometimes I have to repeat things cause that's right. All right. Anyway,

836
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:40,200
so dark soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a system that she thinks, Hey,

837
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:46,360
this is something that you've neglected and probably with good reason in this case. Yeah,

838
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:50,520
definitely with good reason. Although I kind of want one just to have one because I've been

839
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:55,960
hearing about, well, not just that, but I've been hearing about people doing like different, uh,

840
01:17:55,960 --> 01:18:02,360
mods to a minute of emulation on it. So, all right. It is the apple Pippin. Yep. And I'm

841
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:07,160
going to apologize to the live listeners because for some reason the audio here is left channel

842
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:14,280
only, which is weird. I didn't realize, but I, I could not find any with music. So, uh,

843
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:17,960
so I apologize for the live listeners. It's going to sound weird. The podcast because the podcast

844
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:23,880
is in mono. Uh, you're not going to notice this because the podcast for a size sake is not in the

845
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:30,760
greatest quality. So anyway, here is some of the background music from what Pippin game was this?

846
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:36,760
Oh, tropic Island. I think it's pinball game. Yeah. So anyway, um, the Pippin,

847
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:42,440
I kind of look at the Pippin is kind of as a precursor to the apple TV, to be honest. Um,

848
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:50,600
it was meant to be, um, a, uh, uh, audio visual stereo and television environment. Um,

849
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:58,120
it ran on the classic Mac OS architecture and it had, um, uh,

850
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:05,480
it actually was a licensed out to Bondi. Um, well the at Mark and at world models, um,

851
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:10,520
so that they could release them, um, in, uh, the Japanese and American markets as video game

852
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:18,840
systems. Um, and they also, um, was licensed out to caps media for the KMP 2000, um, that focused

853
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:27,800
on Europe and Canada. So the Pippin was named for the new, the new town Pippin, which is a type of

854
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:33,560
apple that is more tart than the Macintosh, which of course the Mac computer was named for.

855
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:42,360
So anyway, um, another neat thing about it though, is that Pippin was, um, used for, uh,

856
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:49,080
the, uh, a code name for the apple profile system that was out at the time for the apple three and

857
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:55,240
the apple Lisa. Can I just call out what an idiot I am live on air because I never realized that,

858
01:19:55,240 --> 01:20:01,480
yeah, duh. All these things were named after apples. Yeah. I don't know why I never,

859
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:05,000
I guess I never really sat down to think about that before. Like where did the name

860
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:11,720
Macintosh come from? That's why my favorite apple to eat is an iPhone. Anyway, girl.

861
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:19,320
Um, but the intention, um, was never to release the Pippin on its own. It was meant to be, um,

862
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:25,720
open standard by licensing out, licensing out the technology, like how, um, JVC shared VHS,

863
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:32,680
you know. Um, so it was, it was neat for its time, but it really didn't, you know,

864
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:39,720
have, I'd say a whole much to offer. It was running on the, um, uh, well the original hardware,

865
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:45,880
I should say, was based off of the Mac classic two. So it was a 16 megahertz Motorola, uh,

866
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:57,240
68030 running, um, uh, you know, the Mac software. And it was, um, you know, it had,

867
01:20:57,240 --> 01:21:03,320
you know, at the time it had a pretty standard logic board. The, you know, the casing was

868
01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:12,840
designed by Bondi. So it really seemed to be a, um, you know, a good partnership. Um, but

869
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:21,160
the whole thing too is that this also was a system that could connect to the internet. Um,

870
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:29,480
it had a haze compatible modem, uh, built in. Um, and, you know, it's, yeah, one of the earliest

871
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:35,560
systems that had, um, internet connectivity built in. Um, and it was, uh, announced, um,

872
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:46,600
in Tokyo on December 13th, 1994, which I had graduated high school by then. Um, and then,

873
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:53,960
um, it also looked like in 1995, um, it was reported by Nikkei that Mitsubishi was going to

874
01:21:53,960 --> 01:22:01,000
use the, um, the Pippin technology. And, but they never did actually sign an agreement. It

875
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:08,840
did manufacture, um, systems for Bondi and Cat's Media. Um, so it had a lot of crazy involvement

876
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:20,440
on it and, you know, there was also, um, uh, the death of the Pippin itself actually came about

877
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:26,920
when Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 97. So it's his fault. He pulled the plug on it. He was like,

878
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:34,360
no more. He stopped all of the Macintosh clones. So that included, included, um, the Apple Pippin,

879
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:45,400
uh, concept. So, um, and then, uh, uh, Cat's Media and Bondi continued to support the Pippin, um,

880
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:51,480
for a little bit longer, but, um, they had a hundred thousand units committed, but only sold

881
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:59,560
something like 40,000, 45,000. Uh, they sold that many? Um, and Bondi quit, uh, actually Bondi

882
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:06,680
continued to support it until December 31st, 2002. Um, but for games that came out on the Pippin,

883
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:13,000
um, it had some interesting licenses. Um, not too much came out in Japan, really. Um, and it came

884
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:17,480
out with like fewer than 80 games and applications. It was just like Microsoft anything in Japan,

885
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:23,000
basically. Yeah. In the US, there were 18 games that were stored separately and six CDs that came

886
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:30,040
with the Pippin. Um, had the, the browser was, uh, came out over CDs. So it was able to update to TV

887
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:35,480
works with the text and drawing app in it, but it can't, you could get anime designer, Dragon Ball Z,

888
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:40,360
which by the way, did get a PC release later. Um, at least an emulated one. You had the Compton's

889
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:46,280
Interactive Encyclopedia, Exotic Sushi. Well, that sounds like a boring game. Who wants to play the

890
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:52,280
encyclopedia? This was funny. It was movie. Okay. Mr. Potato Head Saves Veggie Valley. Okay. That

891
01:23:52,280 --> 01:23:58,280
might be fun. Uh, The Journeyman Project, Pegasus Prime, Power Rangers, Zeo versus the Machine

892
01:23:58,280 --> 01:24:03,880
Empire. Oh, don't tell Shane. Yeah. Right. Um, Super Marathon. Yeah. Shockwave Invasion Earth,

893
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:10,040
2019. Um, and, but what I thought was funny is that the controller was called the Apple Jack.

894
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:17,640
Oh, like the cereal. I reckon. Okay. Um, but for accessories, you could get either a wired or

895
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:22,200
wireless, um, Apple Jack controller. You get a keyboard and drawing tablet. You can get the

896
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:30,120
modems up to 33.6, uh, kilobytes, uh, kilobits a second. Sorry. You can bump the memory up to 16

897
01:24:30,120 --> 01:24:34,200
megabytes. Wait a minute. Wait, what year was the Pippin? 94. And they were doing wireless

898
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:38,440
controllers in 94? Yeah. Okay. Now that's pretty, that part's pretty impressive because I don't

899
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:41,880
think a lot of systems really started like wireless didn't become standard until what

900
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:49,480
PlayStation two or three? It came with a floppy drive. It had an ammo 256, uh, 256 megabyte

901
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:56,600
optical disc. Um, the ADB adapter for connecting a Mac computer, Mac computer devices to a Pippin

902
01:24:56,600 --> 01:25:01,640
and the Pippin to Macintosh ADB adapter for connecting the Pippin devices to Macintosh. So

903
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:05,960
it also can use, it used the old Apple color style writer,

904
01:25:05,960 --> 01:25:12,680
2,400 and 2,500 printers through its serial port. So, and again, I look at this as being

905
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:19,000
the precursor to the Apple TV, really, because I have an Apple TV that I've been playing Sonic CD

906
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:26,760
on with a wireless controller. So had to start somewhere. All right. There it is your classic

907
01:25:26,760 --> 01:25:32,840
system of the month, the Apple Pippin, which apparently 40,000 plus people had. And I didn't

908
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:38,840
know a one. So there you go. A little bit of a, a little bit of history there in our classic system

909
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:43,400
of the month. Actually, let me ask if you can hand the mic. I know first off, I got to compliment

910
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:48,520
Becky. Cause I was able to eat some of this pumpkin spice cake while, uh, while Jamie was

911
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:52,680
doing her segment there. And this is delicious. This is amazing. It's like carrot cake, but without

912
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:59,080
the lame carrots. Well, yeah, it's a pumpkin spice cake. I actually just found the recipe

913
01:25:59,080 --> 01:26:03,240
on the internet a couple of weeks ago. Fantastic. All you people listening should be jealous right

914
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:06,920
now. That's awesome. Thank you so much, Becky. I really appreciate them. I want to ask Julian

915
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:10,680
real quick, our special guests tonight before, cause I know, I know y'all are, you have to do

916
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:14,040
a half show tonight, Jamie, and I'm assuming everybody else's is only here for half the show.

917
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:18,760
So I want to ask Julian before, before we kind of wrap up here, what do you think of classic games?

918
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:22,840
Do you like to, I know we joked earlier about, I don't ask if a movie is made in the eighties

919
01:26:22,840 --> 01:26:27,000
or anything like that, but do you, do you go back and play old games just to kind of

920
01:26:27,960 --> 01:26:31,720
see what they're like or do you, do you enjoy the old stuff or what?

921
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:40,520
Uh, sometimes I'm going to say this before, um, I answer your question. Sometimes I mix up

922
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:44,600
new games with old games like undertale. I thought it was made in the early two thousands

923
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:50,920
just because, or nine nineties. Yeah. Just because you made on purpose, horrible graphics.

924
01:26:50,920 --> 01:26:55,640
Yeah. Like that's like, that's like what people do now. Like Minecraft was kind of like that too.

925
01:26:55,640 --> 01:27:02,200
Yeah. But, um, I forgot what the question was. Oh, that's okay. I was going to say, do you,

926
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:06,120
do you like to go back and play old games? Do you like to learn about the old history or just,

927
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:08,920
you know, you just play them cause they're fun or do you not play mall?

928
01:27:09,880 --> 01:27:16,120
I like to, but I usually don't at home. I usually play tons of old games when I, um, go to, um,

929
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:23,080
Jamie's house or something. Cause it was the one place I played the original NES Mario

930
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:37,080
video game. Yeah. Um, I also, um, played the third Mario game at, um, um, at school, um, after

931
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:46,280
school kids play video games at school now. Oh, excuse me. Excuse me. Um, I, um, on someone's

932
01:27:46,280 --> 01:27:53,800
three D S it was horrible because I got to like the castle or something is like, Hey, guess what?

933
01:27:53,800 --> 01:28:00,520
You lost all your lives. Start back at, start back at one dash one video games used to be really

934
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:08,120
cruel games. Didn't have a save and load option at all. No, it was very rare. It was very rare,

935
01:28:08,120 --> 01:28:12,360
but I'm glad to anti Jamie is teaching you, right? And he plays pinball at my house. Oh yeah.

936
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:17,960
Pinball's fun. We got two new pinballs that you need to come play. You like pinball Julian?

937
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:26,280
Um, yes, but often extremely frustrating when you try to hit it, but then before you can,

938
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:33,000
it just dropped down. I know. I hate when it goes right down the middle and when you try to hit,

939
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:37,880
you can't hit it. Same kid. Same goes right down the middle. Feels same way. Some frustration.

940
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:42,760
We refer to that as a center drain. All right. Anyway, uh, dark soccer. I know you're going to

941
01:28:42,760 --> 01:28:45,800
be leaving us here. I'm not going to be joining us for the second half of the show. Cause you

942
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:51,960
have some engagements early tomorrow morning. But did you want to quickly touch on some of your

943
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:54,920
rapid fire stories? I know we usually do those at the beginning of the next segment, but you

944
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:58,600
want to touch on your rapid fire stories here real quick? Well, Marvel got incredibly fussed

945
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:03,080
out for, um, saying they were going to do a presentation with a defense contractor,

946
01:29:03,080 --> 01:29:08,520
Northrop Grumman, uh, Grumman. I'm saying that weird. Um, but then because of all the backlash,

947
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:13,560
they actually canceled it because they were accused of working with war profiteering. So

948
01:29:14,680 --> 01:29:22,520
good that they canceled that. Um, and also in somewhat better news, Neo Geo battle Colosseum

949
01:29:22,920 --> 01:29:29,880
is rumored to be in, uh, a development at SNK. So that would be nice. Is that something you'd

950
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:36,120
want to play? Maybe. So it's supposed to be all cell shaded, kind of like how, um,

951
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:41,720
Arc System Works does their thing. And of course we get all of our SNK characters that we like.

952
01:29:42,520 --> 01:29:45,960
Did you see the funny typo though? They were saying that they were going to have, um,

953
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:52,280
uh, uh, Tekken at one of the things and they said it was goose Howard.

954
01:29:53,560 --> 01:29:59,080
Oh, that was funny. Like a high auto correct. Yeah. It's funny when a auto correct ruins

955
01:29:59,080 --> 01:30:02,760
everything. Right. Auto correct does ruin everything. All right. Well, we are going

956
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:07,160
to go to a break here and when we come back, it's just going to be Loki and I here left to, uh,

957
01:30:07,160 --> 01:30:10,120
peruse the rest of the show and then take your calls here in the second half of our

958
01:30:10,120 --> 01:30:15,080
show at orange lounge radio on Skype. Again, that's all one word, orange lounge radio on

959
01:30:15,080 --> 01:30:18,440
Skype. Uh, but I do want to thank of course, dark soccer for being here and I'll let her have

960
01:30:18,440 --> 01:30:21,960
her final thought in a minute there after she finishes her cake. Uh, but I do want to thank,

961
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:26,040
thank you Becky so much for bringing the cake tonight. And of course bringing the kid really

962
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:30,280
appreciate that. So, uh, you, you have yourself a fabulous time and we hope to have you guys.

963
01:30:30,280 --> 01:30:33,480
You don't have to bring food to be on the show. Becky, you can come anytime you like.

964
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:39,400
All right. I'll bring food anyway. It's just my way. You're, you're the bomb. You're awesome.

965
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:44,760
Speaking of the bomb, Julian, the listeners love you. They think it's awesome that you

966
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:47,160
were on this show tonight. You got to come back sometime. All right.

967
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:51,880
Okay. All right. And also thank, thank you to the people that think I'm awesome,

968
01:30:51,880 --> 01:31:00,200
even though I'm a 10 year old. It's it's Julian. It's okay to be an awesome 10 year old.

969
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:04,920
So stay awesome. It's also okay to be an awesome eight year old. Last time I was on the show,

970
01:31:06,440 --> 01:31:09,880
but I still wasn't as awesome. I sucked back. All right. All right. Just don't,

971
01:31:09,880 --> 01:31:14,280
just don't become total trash at 12. All right. All right. It's like I had this

972
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:21,400
awesome phase when I was eight, nine, 10, and then I was an ass and then like,

973
01:31:22,280 --> 01:31:27,960
and I started becoming an asshole when I was 13. Yeah. Don't do that. Don't do that. Some kids go

974
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:32,200
to high school and they become total jerks. Don't be one of them. All right. Sounds good.

975
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:35,880
Treat, treat the other kids with respect. All right. I think the official word is try not to

976
01:31:35,880 --> 01:31:41,240
suck. That's right. Try not. All right. Uh, we'll be back here in a little bit. Oh, I'm sorry. Oh,

977
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:47,080
sorry. Sorry. Of course. How very dare you. I was looking right at the rest of this cake

978
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:50,440
that has to be finished. Can you blame me that I'm well then I can do my final thought while

979
01:31:50,440 --> 01:31:53,240
you eat your damn cake. That sounds good. Dark soccer. Your final thought.

980
01:31:54,680 --> 01:32:00,200
Sit down in your chair and drink your God damn tea. Sorry. That was Sid. Um, my final thought is

981
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:07,160
because I did just come back from seeing gorillas and it was a fucking amazing show and Damon is

982
01:32:07,160 --> 01:32:12,280
showing his age a bit, but it's still kind of hot. And, um, I got to see Dell, the funky

983
01:32:12,280 --> 01:32:19,720
homo sapiens. That was pretty nuts. Um, but reject false icons. Fair enough. We're going to take a

984
01:32:19,720 --> 01:32:23,720
quick break. You guys will be back. Don't, don't leave. The show's not over. We're going to take

985
01:32:23,720 --> 01:32:27,880
a break. We'll be back to wrap it up with your phone calls and more news, including things like

986
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:33,080
a stranger things based video game. We'll talk about Fortnite battle Royale and of course your

987
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:36,920
emails. When we come back with more of orange lounge radio right after this,

988
01:32:43,560 --> 01:32:49,720
welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio live tonight on the 8th of October, 2017

989
01:32:49,720 --> 01:32:56,360
with episode 703 of our show already in progress. Oh, the studio feels a lot more empty now.

990
01:32:56,360 --> 01:33:02,040
Yes. Just Loki and I left here, but, uh, Oh God, that kid is so funny. I was, uh, that's great.

991
01:33:02,040 --> 01:33:05,880
You know what I like about kids, you know, even though I'm like, Oh, kids are probably not for

992
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:09,080
me. And maybe you would have a unique perspective on this. Cause I know you have two kids and I

993
01:33:09,080 --> 01:33:13,400
don't, but I was always like, you know, one thing I can appreciate about kids. They're not going to

994
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:16,760
lie to you. They're going to, they're going to tell you, they're going to tell you the cold,

995
01:33:16,760 --> 01:33:20,280
hard truth a lot of the times. And that's kind of what, that's what I felt coming from Julie

996
01:33:20,280 --> 01:33:25,560
in there a little bit ago on games. So, yeah. So is that, are your, do your kids tell the truth too?

997
01:33:25,560 --> 01:33:30,200
Usually they just like to talk about things. Okay. Now we're still trying to get your oldest

998
01:33:30,200 --> 01:33:34,680
on the show at some point, right? Hopefully. Yeah. It's just tough with bedtimes and everything.

999
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:37,320
Yeah. We have to do it earlier in the day. Next time we do a noon show or something,

1000
01:33:37,320 --> 01:33:41,800
we'll have Mon. So awesome. All right. Well, usually, usually if there's a concert that

1001
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:44,840
Jamie and I have to go to or drag queen, we have to go see on Sunday night. That's when

1002
01:33:44,840 --> 01:33:49,640
the noon shows happen. So we'll cross our fingers for that. All right.

1003
01:33:51,560 --> 01:33:54,360
To register participation for this week's episode of orange Andre,

1004
01:33:54,440 --> 01:33:57,720
created with vog network.com. Use the passphrase stage.

1005
01:33:59,240 --> 01:34:03,880
Uh, anyway, so, uh, before we get into some rapid fire news, Loki, I want to know your thoughts on

1006
01:34:03,880 --> 01:34:09,960
this because it's not directly related to games, but I think a lot of tech nerds are really feeling

1007
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:16,280
it this week. And that's the fact that AOL instant messenger is going to be shutting down. That's

1008
01:34:16,280 --> 01:34:22,760
right on December 15th, AOL instant messenger is going to be gone. Uh, anything of AOL leftover

1009
01:34:22,760 --> 01:34:28,840
except the people still, I guess using the AOL email still has dial up available if you need it.

1010
01:34:28,840 --> 01:34:33,160
Well, I mean, I guess it would make sense that maybe like, and I'm talking like places like

1011
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:39,560
Alaska, you know, like rural, rural Montana, like there's probably still places in the country where

1012
01:34:39,560 --> 01:34:44,760
they just don't have high speed internet, you know, that they probably barely have phone lines.

1013
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:50,360
So I imagine that people still have to have some dial up, like very, very limited stuff. You know,

1014
01:34:50,680 --> 01:34:54,920
people out there aren't going to be playing video games on it, but they're using it to grab their

1015
01:34:54,920 --> 01:35:00,360
email and things like that, you know? So if you're lucky to grab your email, geez. Yeah. Yeah. I

1016
01:35:00,360 --> 01:35:04,760
guess it depends in this day and age, what kind of attachments you're getting on email. It might

1017
01:35:04,760 --> 01:35:09,160
take a while to download, but yeah, as far as I know, AOL still operates a full dial up service,

1018
01:35:09,160 --> 01:35:14,200
just like they used to. I mean, that's not their only thing. Uh, last time I checked in on him,

1019
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:19,720
I think they were trying to make money from being like a triple a of tech. Does that make sense?

1020
01:35:19,720 --> 01:35:23,880
You know how like triple a your membership gets you discounts at all these different places.

1021
01:35:23,880 --> 01:35:28,920
I think AOL kind of tries to do that. Like they do like discounts on cell phone bills and all

1022
01:35:28,920 --> 01:35:32,360
from being a member. Yeah, it, I know it's not that appealing, but that's what you asked what

1023
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:37,640
they're doing. If they're still around. I mean, that's what they're doing. Also, AOL was bought

1024
01:35:37,640 --> 01:35:43,640
at some point by, I think it was Verizon, if I'm not mistaken, which are oath that whole branch,

1025
01:35:43,640 --> 01:35:48,360
which if I'm not mistaken, just by Yahoo as well. So maybe something is going to happen where AOL

1026
01:35:48,360 --> 01:35:54,520
and Yahoo kind of come together. I'm not sure. Hmm. Yeah. So the people have abandoned,

1027
01:35:54,520 --> 01:36:01,320
but I don't, well, did you use AOL messenger a lot? Loki in the nineties? I used it a lot.

1028
01:36:01,320 --> 01:36:04,600
Well, it's funny earlier in the show, we were talking about the whole like online games and

1029
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:09,560
how I'm playing one again. It's been a very long time, but I remember seven, eight years ago,

1030
01:36:09,560 --> 01:36:15,400
it was all on AOL instant messenger because Facebook messenger wasn't a thing yet. Yeah.

1031
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:20,840
And text messages still cost money. Like, you know, which if you still have an archaic cell

1032
01:36:20,840 --> 01:36:27,400
phone, but I finally got off a cell phone plan last year that charged me like over 1000 text

1033
01:36:27,400 --> 01:36:31,160
messages. I had to pay like 10 cents because I don't, I don't get that many text messages,

1034
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:36,840
especially when you have iMessage between iPhones is all free. Yeah. But I think all that stuff

1035
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:41,400
has killed the need for AOL. Like, you know, I don't remember the last time I signed into AOL,

1036
01:36:41,400 --> 01:36:49,160
it's all Facebook messenger, Skype, um, text message, like all of that pretty much Snapchat,

1037
01:36:49,160 --> 01:36:55,480
even you ever use Snapchat? No. Yeah. I used Snapchat once. Did you? And that was it. Those

1038
01:36:55,480 --> 01:37:00,200
are fun. I didn't actually send anything. I just, I like looking at other people's stuff because

1039
01:37:00,200 --> 01:37:04,360
other people post stories and it'll be like, here's this concert I'm at, or here's this,

1040
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:08,520
you know, show I'm looking at, or here's my drunk friend doing karaoke and, you know,

1041
01:37:08,520 --> 01:37:13,160
watching that kind of stuff. Cool. But you know, that's like the Snapchat interface is really

1042
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:20,040
weird. Like, like, like an old ass man, Alan had to sit me down and be like, okay, so if you swipe

1043
01:37:20,040 --> 01:37:24,040
to the right, that's where you see everybody's stories. And it was like, I had to like,

1044
01:37:24,040 --> 01:37:28,600
right. And then I heard some stupid, I think it was Snapchat or maybe it was Tinder where like

1045
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:33,160
the developers of it, they're like, well, we made it like that on purpose because old people can't

1046
01:37:33,160 --> 01:37:36,280
figure it out. And we're like, we don't want old people on earth. It was like,

1047
01:37:37,640 --> 01:37:42,040
fucking stupid. I mean like, and not that I would find something like that complicated,

1048
01:37:42,040 --> 01:37:47,560
but just that attitude is just fucking stupid. It is. It's Aegist. Tigerclaw on chat over at

1049
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:53,560
live.vognetwork.com is saying ICQ is still around. Is it really? I just remember that little,

1050
01:37:53,560 --> 01:37:58,600
uh oh noise it made like every time you got a message is just, did everybody's make the

1051
01:37:58,600 --> 01:38:06,040
same noise on ICQ? Did you ever use ICQ? No, I'm almost positive. My number was something like,

1052
01:38:06,040 --> 01:38:11,720
it was only a few digits. It was one, two, nine, seven, two, two, six. It was a seven digit number,

1053
01:38:11,720 --> 01:38:15,560
which is pretty low. Don't bother sending in a message cause ain't nobody checking it. I don't

1054
01:38:15,560 --> 01:38:19,400
even remember the password. I might not be right on the number, but I don't have like a seven digit

1055
01:38:19,400 --> 01:38:24,920
number on ICQ, which I guess was considered really low. So that was cool, I guess, but I just

1056
01:38:24,920 --> 01:38:30,600
remember that little noise whenever you got the message. And then I've got like random messages

1057
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:34,520
from people like in South America and stuff. It's like, I don't even know these people that

1058
01:38:34,520 --> 01:38:39,560
are just messaging me out of the blue. I guess maybe it was the earliest days of spam. I don't

1059
01:38:39,560 --> 01:38:44,280
know. But you think is, do you think ICQ is still big in some parts of the world? I guess I have no

1060
01:38:44,280 --> 01:38:50,200
idea. I don't know. All right. Uh, anyhow, let's move on. Let's do some rapid fire news back to

1061
01:38:50,280 --> 01:38:57,080
video games. All right. So there's, um, some teases coming from the producer of the Mega Man

1062
01:38:57,080 --> 01:39:05,320
legacy collection to Kazuhiro Tsuchiya. He's basically hinting that some announcement for

1063
01:39:05,320 --> 01:39:11,080
Mega Man's 30th anniversary is going to be made in December. I want to say that Capcom has not

1064
01:39:11,080 --> 01:39:18,040
forgotten about Rockman. Um, this here, the Mega Man 30th anniversary logo is being put to good

1065
01:39:18,040 --> 01:39:23,320
use. The Rockman 30th anniversary is coming to December, December. Please remember that date.

1066
01:39:23,960 --> 01:39:27,160
I don't remember. I remember something similar to this last week. I don't know if it was the

1067
01:39:27,160 --> 01:39:30,920
exact same thing. I remember Jamie mentioned something like this, but I remember, because

1068
01:39:30,920 --> 01:39:37,000
this is just in line with what I said last week, December is PlayStation experience. So if Capcom

1069
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:41,880
is going to drop a bomb, like new Mega Man game coming, PlayStation experience certainly seems

1070
01:39:41,880 --> 01:39:45,960
like the place to do that, especially for December. Like what else? They said that the

1071
01:39:45,960 --> 01:39:51,400
original Mega Man was released in December 17th. So yeah, but video games, you know, way back then

1072
01:39:51,400 --> 01:39:56,440
video games, weren't quite like they are now where it's like a lot of the big stuff comes out at the

1073
01:39:56,440 --> 01:40:01,080
end of the year. Although I feel like we're getting back to that year round of releases,

1074
01:40:01,080 --> 01:40:06,600
because, you know, we've got a lot of big games that come out in January now, you know, uh, which

1075
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:12,200
used to be like the deadest time of year, but there's a few things you get a few big, uh, and

1076
01:40:12,280 --> 01:40:15,960
then the street fighter five arcade thing. We were just talking about how to January release day,

1077
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:20,760
but it's more of like it, I don't know. I think they released like early in the year to

1078
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:26,200
a secret, that secret of mana remake that I guess is it's not on our show role, but it's actually

1079
01:40:26,200 --> 01:40:30,280
being shown at that New York comic con that's going on right now. Maybe, I don't know if Rama

1080
01:40:30,280 --> 01:40:33,960
was there, maybe one of our other New York folks, but I imagine somebody, somebody had to have gotten

1081
01:40:33,960 --> 01:40:39,240
their hands on it. I'm, I'm really curious to see, uh, how that secret of mana game looked. So I know

1082
01:40:39,240 --> 01:40:43,560
that, but that's out in like February, if I remember right. So, you know, early in the year

1083
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:50,920
we're getting some big releases now. So, yep. So, um, there's, uh, the tying game that, well,

1084
01:40:50,920 --> 01:40:55,400
it's sort of like, I don't know, it almost seems like a fan game, but it, there's a stranger things

1085
01:40:55,400 --> 01:41:02,440
game that's on iOS and, um, the Google play store and it's free. So definitely worth checking out

1086
01:41:02,440 --> 01:41:09,320
because free, um, it looks like an SNES game, but I guess it's about revolving around the,

1087
01:41:10,200 --> 01:41:16,440
um, season one story. So, I mean, I don't know, it'd be worth checking out, but, um,

1088
01:41:16,440 --> 01:41:22,360
you have different characters with different abilities. Um, of course you can explore Hawkins

1089
01:41:22,360 --> 01:41:27,960
and the upside down and other things like that, but, uh, that'll tide you over maybe until the

1090
01:41:27,960 --> 01:41:33,560
second season, which comes out in October 27th. I hope you can run into Barb. That would be great.

1091
01:41:33,560 --> 01:41:40,200
Actually, I did download this, uh, onto my phone and I tried playing a little bit of it. And

1092
01:41:40,200 --> 01:41:44,840
it's a lot since, since, uh, it is like an old school game, but you do touch to move places

1093
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:50,520
in the game. So, uh, the, the audio on this is so low. I wish I could turn this up so you can kind

1094
01:41:50,520 --> 01:41:55,720
of hear it, but it actually has like an eight bit version of the theme that actually plays.

1095
01:41:55,720 --> 01:42:03,160
It's probably not coming through very well, but kind of cool. So, Hey, it's free, free.

1096
01:42:03,160 --> 01:42:07,400
I just wish it was free on PC, you know, where you have actual keys and buttons.

1097
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:11,800
Well, I had assumed the game is designed around tapping. Like it wasn't that you like

1098
01:42:11,800 --> 01:42:15,240
hold up or hold it. Like you tap on the screen where you want the character to move and the

1099
01:42:15,240 --> 01:42:20,040
character like a puzzle game or is it all action packed and stuff? Uh, I think there are action

1100
01:42:20,040 --> 01:42:24,520
elements, but it's a little more puzzle puzzle than it is action, but like there will be things

1101
01:42:24,520 --> 01:42:28,760
where you shoot things, but it's like tap to shoot and things like that. I think it's not

1102
01:42:28,760 --> 01:42:32,760
particularly complex, but I haven't played a lot of it. So don't quote me on any of that.

1103
01:42:33,400 --> 01:42:37,720
All right. Uh, some rapid fire news for me. Well, this is a little bit of a disappointment

1104
01:42:37,720 --> 01:42:41,960
because last week we were kind of hyping up the next Splatfest because in Europe,

1105
01:42:41,960 --> 01:42:46,360
they were going to get the, uh, toilet paper, which way should it go? Should it go over the

1106
01:42:46,360 --> 01:42:52,120
roller behind the rolls, which led to the whole discussion on back rolls. Uh, but, and, and we

1107
01:42:52,120 --> 01:42:55,800
thought, Oh, well, since the Europe Splatfest always matches the American Splatfest, or at

1108
01:42:55,800 --> 01:43:01,880
least it has the past few times, that's what we're going to get for sure. But Nope, we are not

1109
01:43:01,880 --> 01:43:08,440
getting the great toilet paper showdown of 2017. Instead, the theme for Splatfest here in America

1110
01:43:08,440 --> 01:43:16,200
will be team vampire versus team werewolf fucking Twilight was years ago. I'm like, we're,

1111
01:43:16,200 --> 01:43:20,360
uh, you just took the joke. I was going to be, we literally are getting the Twilight

1112
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:25,880
showdown here. Jacob versus what's his name? Edward. Well, what the fuck was that guy's name?

1113
01:43:25,880 --> 01:43:29,080
Yeah, it's Edward. Okay. Edward versus Jacob. That's what we're getting,

1114
01:43:29,080 --> 01:43:36,040
uh, here in the States. So I guess, I mean, it's Halloween month, so I get it. It's, you know,

1115
01:43:36,040 --> 01:43:39,640
it's, it's, it's tying to Halloween, but I was still kind of looking forward to toilet

1116
01:43:39,640 --> 01:43:45,800
papering. Some of these houses, Halloween tradition too. That's true. So anyway, what do you, what do

1117
01:43:45,800 --> 01:43:50,920
you think team vampire or team werewolf? I think I'm leaning, you know, I, I understand that with

1118
01:43:50,920 --> 01:43:54,440
all the talk that we've had in previous weeks about Manthurn and things like that, that maybe

1119
01:43:54,440 --> 01:44:00,200
werewolf, but, uh, but team vampire is purple. Like that, that purple color of the paint is awesome.

1120
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:05,720
So I think I might go team vampire blood red. You would think, right. But then what would the

1121
01:44:05,720 --> 01:44:10,360
wearable one be? Uh, the werewolf one is like brown, I guess like for something like that.

1122
01:44:10,360 --> 01:44:16,520
I don't know. So, well, there you go. So, uh, you can, uh, check that out. October 13th is when the

1123
01:44:16,520 --> 01:44:22,360
great vampire versus werewolf showdown begins. Uh, Oh, sorry. Act F it's orange, not brown.

1124
01:44:22,360 --> 01:44:28,040
Sorry about that. Orange. It looked brown on the photo. Uh, also this is a really awesome,

1125
01:44:28,040 --> 01:44:32,600
like gamers doing good news. I like to read things like this. Uh, there's a cool little

1126
01:44:32,600 --> 01:44:38,600
charity album that has just been released. It's called spirit, uh, which is a, uh, game music

1127
01:44:38,600 --> 01:44:43,800
charity, uh, album. And it's to benefit victims of hurricane Harvey. And I think that's awesome.

1128
01:44:43,800 --> 01:44:48,200
So you can actually check that out. It's available on iTunes, on Spotify, even,

1129
01:44:48,200 --> 01:44:52,760
and on band camp. There's only four tracks and they're kind of remixes from other games,

1130
01:44:52,760 --> 01:44:56,840
but still again, it's for a good cause. So it's worth checking out. It has a

1131
01:44:56,840 --> 01:45:02,920
hopes and dreams from undertale. Uh, it has main theme from final fantasy seven by Ruby tongue,

1132
01:45:02,920 --> 01:45:08,200
uh, apotheosis journey from the game journey, excuse me, uh, a remix by Steven,

1133
01:45:08,200 --> 01:45:12,920
Robert, uh, Frober. I hope I said that right. And then the ending theme to Pokemon Ruby and

1134
01:45:12,920 --> 01:45:18,280
Sapphire by Braxton Burks. So it's just four tracks, but still it's a great cause. So it's

1135
01:45:18,280 --> 01:45:23,240
definitely worth checking out. So if you have like an Apple music or a Spotify thing, go listen to

1136
01:45:23,240 --> 01:45:27,880
it. Cause at least, you know, they get some money that way. So check that out, but by the album,

1137
01:45:27,880 --> 01:45:32,040
if you want to do some good there, uh, for the greater Houston community foundation.

1138
01:45:32,600 --> 01:45:36,680
Awesome. Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates. So we'll start

1139
01:45:36,680 --> 01:45:40,520
in the U S with Loki and maybe he'll help me pick up the UK releases too.

1140
01:45:40,520 --> 01:45:45,080
So this week we do have a few things coming out. So we have a game called 88 heroes,

1141
01:45:45,080 --> 01:45:51,240
a 98 heroes edition on the Nintendo switch. Uh, we have a game called art. Oh, is it

1142
01:45:52,200 --> 01:46:00,280
Artika one that's on the Oculus rift, cyber dimension, Neptunia four goddesses online,

1143
01:46:00,280 --> 01:46:05,480
or I guess it's cyber dimension, Neptunia four goddesses online. So it's kind of weird,

1144
01:46:06,280 --> 01:46:12,200
middle earth shadow of war coming out on a PC PlayStation four and Xbox one. And then of course,

1145
01:46:12,200 --> 01:46:18,120
cyber dimension Neptunia that was on PlayStation four raid world war two on PlayStation four and

1146
01:46:18,120 --> 01:46:28,680
Xbox one tiny barbarian DX on the switch, uh, Toho or Toho Kabuto five burst battle on

1147
01:46:28,680 --> 01:46:35,720
the Nintendo switch PlayStation four and the Vita, uh, chaos child on PlayStation four and the Vita

1148
01:46:37,320 --> 01:46:43,560
and the evil within two looks like on PC PlayStation four and Xbox one.

1149
01:46:43,560 --> 01:46:46,440
That's out already. I mean, I knew that was coming out, but I thought,

1150
01:46:46,440 --> 01:46:50,920
I guess that makes sense. Scary games in October. It's that's when you do them. So, all right.

1151
01:46:50,920 --> 01:46:55,400
That's it. All right. We're getting to that end of the year rush. Uh, Japan also, uh,

1152
01:46:55,400 --> 01:46:59,160
seeing some releases this week, they are also getting their Japanese version of

1153
01:46:59,160 --> 01:47:02,920
middle earth shadow of war, which I imagine is kind of the big game here in the States this

1154
01:47:02,920 --> 01:47:06,520
week. And you know, probably, I don't think it's as big of a deal in Japan, but they are getting

1155
01:47:06,520 --> 01:47:10,840
a localized version over there from Warner. Uh, also coming out in Japan this week, lost

1156
01:47:10,840 --> 01:47:15,480
sphere, but that's spelled S P H E A R. They spelled it a little differently. Uh, and then

1157
01:47:15,480 --> 01:47:22,040
date a live Rio reincarnation HD. Yes. That is a game that is coming out in both a regular

1158
01:47:22,040 --> 01:47:26,600
and a limited edition. And it looks like another, uh, school girl manga type of game.

1159
01:47:26,600 --> 01:47:31,080
Uh, as we see get released there that doesn't usually get released over here. Uh, nothing on

1160
01:47:31,080 --> 01:47:35,000
the Vita for a change. I know we make Vita is dead jokes here in the U S all the time,

1161
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:39,720
but Japan usually has some things to talk about, but it doesn't look like they actually do this

1162
01:47:39,720 --> 01:47:47,720
week. So I have to jump over to the Nintendo switch to find lost sphere is also out on the D

1163
01:47:47,720 --> 01:47:53,880
excuse me, the switch this week. Uh, and then lastly, over on the 3DS, uh, there is no new

1164
01:47:53,880 --> 01:48:01,800
games, but they have the new Nintendo 3DS XL, uh, is being released, uh, as that. Oh, I'm sorry.

1165
01:48:01,800 --> 01:48:07,000
I'm getting for some reason, a Europe thing snuck into my list there that is not being released

1166
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:11,320
in Japan. My bad. I guess a little preview of what to look forward to in Europe. If Loki has

1167
01:48:11,320 --> 01:48:16,760
those dates ready. Yes. Um, so not a whole lot coming out. Um, we've got, of course,

1168
01:48:16,760 --> 01:48:24,200
a shadow of war coming out on PC PlayStation four and Xbox one. And then of course, uh,

1169
01:48:24,200 --> 01:48:32,520
it looks like the evil within two as well on PC and Xbox one story of seasons trio of towns on 3DS.

1170
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:39,240
That's it. All right, let's go to the mail bag because every week you guys email us,

1171
01:48:39,240 --> 01:48:44,680
participate at orange lounge, radio.com. If you want to participate with the show,

1172
01:48:45,320 --> 01:48:49,320
and we do have a couple of emails to read for you tonight, so let's get to it again.

1173
01:48:49,320 --> 01:48:55,800
It's participate at orange lounge, radio.com. If you want to send us an email for a future week,

1174
01:48:55,800 --> 01:48:59,240
we're going to start off tonight. Jamie's not here, so I will take care of the emails.

1175
01:48:59,240 --> 01:49:03,880
We'll start off tonight with an email from kitten poker. I like that. Is that, is that

1176
01:49:03,880 --> 01:49:07,640
literally cats together, getting together, playing poker, and then writing us emails.

1177
01:49:08,840 --> 01:49:13,720
Anyway, kitten poker says, hello, just making sure you have something to read over that.

1178
01:49:14,440 --> 01:49:18,920
That's very calm. I guess after a couple of weeks of empty mailbags, it's very kind of kitten poker

1179
01:49:18,920 --> 01:49:25,080
to make sure that we have something to do tonight. Thank you. Uh, also not video games, but just

1180
01:49:25,080 --> 01:49:32,440
wondering if you've heard of critical role R O L E and if you have, what do you think of it? Um,

1181
01:49:32,440 --> 01:49:37,880
and thanks kitten poker. That's the email I've heard of it. I have not actually listened to it.

1182
01:49:37,880 --> 01:49:42,600
I'm in the same boat. That's the geeks and sundry getting together and playing D and D show, right?

1183
01:49:42,600 --> 01:49:47,560
Yeah. But that's if I'm going to watch a show like that, that's going to be kind of on the back

1184
01:49:47,560 --> 01:49:53,560
burner to myself watching Harmon's quest, which I still have. I set up my account for, uh, was it

1185
01:49:53,560 --> 01:49:57,400
Verve is what they call it now for season one. Cause I would want to watch that now that it's

1186
01:49:57,400 --> 01:50:03,080
free. I just haven't done it yet. So that would come first, but yes, definitely shows with people

1187
01:50:03,080 --> 01:50:09,640
that are funny playing, you know, D and D I am down with that. Yeah. Uh, yeah. I, I, I, I'm

1188
01:50:09,640 --> 01:50:14,600
familiar with the concept of the show. I must confess. I haven't listened to it. Um, I don't

1189
01:50:14,600 --> 01:50:19,000
get to listen to as many podcasts as you might think. Like I'm, I'm a huge advocate and supporter

1190
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:23,000
that, you know, people who want to do one should be doing one, but I really only get to listen to

1191
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:28,200
them on my commutes. So I'm kind of, I must confess and I hope this doesn't get back to

1192
01:50:28,200 --> 01:50:33,160
them because it will inflate his ego immensely. But one podcast I've been like not missing

1193
01:50:33,160 --> 01:50:37,080
recently is starboard power coupling here at VOG because I've actually been watching

1194
01:50:37,080 --> 01:50:41,640
star Trek discovery. So I've been like dying to know like what those guys think about it.

1195
01:50:41,640 --> 01:50:46,360
And it seems like it's, it's a very mixed panel over there. Like it seems like Dr. Ken's super

1196
01:50:46,360 --> 01:50:49,960
into it. Eddie's kind of, I don't know, this might be too dark. I don't know if I'm into it.

1197
01:50:49,960 --> 01:50:54,280
And then Matt's kind of trying to see both sides of it. So it's been some interesting.

1198
01:50:54,280 --> 01:51:00,600
Also watching was the new Seth MacFarlane one. Oh, the Orville Orville. Uh, no,

1199
01:51:00,600 --> 01:51:06,280
they're not talking about it there, but I know that is the general consensus in the nerd community

1200
01:51:06,280 --> 01:51:11,720
that the Orville is, if you like star Trek, you're probably going to like this. Cause it was like,

1201
01:51:11,720 --> 01:51:15,240
everyone thought it was going to be terrible. Even though I think the reviewers thought it

1202
01:51:15,240 --> 01:51:19,960
was kind of not that great, but then like it was really, it's apparently been pretty good.

1203
01:51:19,960 --> 01:51:23,160
I haven't watched it yet. The reviewers tore it apart, but people actually liked it. But

1204
01:51:23,160 --> 01:51:27,880
wasn't that the way the original star Trek was too? Like didn't reviewers not think it was great.

1205
01:51:27,880 --> 01:51:32,120
And then the fans really saved it. Like I, I almost thought that was how that story went there.

1206
01:51:32,120 --> 01:51:37,320
So I was trying to go to our chat room over at live.vog.network.com. Dungeon buster says

1207
01:51:37,320 --> 01:51:42,760
critical role is also on Twitch. It's basically live streaming tabletop gaming. Yeah. Um,

1208
01:51:42,760 --> 01:51:47,800
there was a show at dragon con where I met a couple of the hosts and they did a very similar

1209
01:51:47,800 --> 01:51:52,200
thing for the, and I I'm such an ass. I forgot the name of their show, but I know it's on giant

1210
01:51:52,200 --> 01:51:56,920
size team up is the name of the network. And they do, it was like, it was, it was like a one word

1211
01:51:56,920 --> 01:52:00,360
name with an exclamation point. It's one of that was, was the name of their show. I think,

1212
01:52:00,360 --> 01:52:05,400
I think it's a neat concept for a show truth be told, like if there were some indie folks that

1213
01:52:05,400 --> 01:52:10,120
wanted to do something like that for vog, like that's the type of show I'd love to recruit for

1214
01:52:10,120 --> 01:52:14,600
this network. I mean, you have to be dedicated to putting out regular additions and all that

1215
01:52:14,600 --> 01:52:20,120
good stuff, but I think those shows are a lot of fun. You know, actually a fun show free the stream

1216
01:52:20,120 --> 01:52:25,000
is, have you ever seen a tabletop was that they have like a tabletop, the game simulator or

1217
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:30,440
tabletop simulator on steam where you set up your own games and yeah, I mean, granted, we just have

1218
01:52:30,440 --> 01:52:35,560
to make sure no one's going to flip the table because you can do that. But you know, I know,

1219
01:52:36,200 --> 01:52:42,440
somebody that is, uh, putting out a board game and somebody that's been working very hard on a board

1220
01:52:42,440 --> 01:52:47,640
game recently, and they've been using tabletop simulator to like test elements of the board

1221
01:52:47,640 --> 01:52:51,800
game without having to go and make all these pieces. If that makes sense. That's cool. Yeah.

1222
01:52:51,800 --> 01:52:55,960
I thought that was a really, it was really neat. Uh, when I, uh, heard about that, uh,

1223
01:52:55,960 --> 01:53:01,320
dark Tetsuya and chat says like a radio drama, uh, that too, I would say radio drama is a little

1224
01:53:01,320 --> 01:53:05,880
more in the Knight Vale camp, which there's, you know, a lot of shows, uh, very well. I mean,

1225
01:53:05,880 --> 01:53:10,440
that's a very different type of podcast, right? That's kind of like fiction versus nonfiction,

1226
01:53:10,440 --> 01:53:13,720
believe it or not. What we're doing here is nonfiction. It's real, right?

1227
01:53:14,520 --> 01:53:19,560
That fiction side of podcasting is a whole nother world that I must admit. I'm not

1228
01:53:19,560 --> 01:53:25,480
super familiar with, but again, I love the idea. And if there was somebody wanting to do a regular

1229
01:53:25,480 --> 01:53:29,480
type of thing, like, you know, that's, that would be a great fit here at the voice keys network,

1230
01:53:29,480 --> 01:53:33,400
I think. So, you know, if you know somebody that's producing a show like that, again,

1231
01:53:33,400 --> 01:53:38,440
the one thing we just want is regularity and we don't want to sign up a show.

1232
01:53:38,440 --> 01:53:42,920
That's going to disappear after five episodes. Cause we already had Poke stop podcast and we

1233
01:53:42,920 --> 01:53:49,160
don't want to do that again. So, all right. Anyway, uh, let's move on to the next email

1234
01:53:50,120 --> 01:53:56,520
last email tonight from our pal Y Y R. We always love to hear from Aaron or Y Y R. Hello,

1235
01:53:56,600 --> 01:54:01,560
LR. Enclosed are just a few of my thoughts on the show from last week.

1236
01:54:01,560 --> 01:54:07,080
First off, I'll answer the question as to why it's worth it to drop 80 beans on the SNES classic.

1237
01:54:07,080 --> 01:54:12,440
There are several reasons actually, but the biggest one is this. While I am all for choosing

1238
01:54:12,440 --> 01:54:17,960
not to spend money on this flawed impractical or poorly handled attempts to bank on nostalgia.

1239
01:54:17,960 --> 01:54:23,000
This is not one of those. After nickel and diming us by making us buy the same virtual

1240
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:28,520
console releases over and over again, apparently, excuse me, to only then cut us off by shutting

1241
01:54:28,520 --> 01:54:34,120
down the storefront and preventing any future redownloading. Here, Nintendo is packing 21 of

1242
01:54:34,120 --> 01:54:39,080
this console's very best games into an adorable plug and play a hundred percent legal physical

1243
01:54:39,080 --> 01:54:44,200
package that can never be taken offline or revoked in any way. On top of this, you also get some

1244
01:54:44,200 --> 01:54:50,360
features that aren't part of either the original console or an ordinary, ordinary emulator,

1245
01:54:50,360 --> 01:54:55,800
such as the visually attractive, easy to use and built-in interface. Let's not forget that catchy

1246
01:54:55,800 --> 01:54:59,880
little tune that plays on the menu too. That's nowhere to be found in Super Nintendo. They made

1247
01:54:59,880 --> 01:55:06,040
it for that. And then the clever rewind feature. But arguably the best part is something that a

1248
01:55:06,040 --> 01:55:13,240
Raspberry Pi absolutely cannot offer. A pair of brand new, 100% authentic and original Super

1249
01:55:13,240 --> 01:55:18,440
Nintendo controllers with the only difference being the interface. This means that the games

1250
01:55:18,440 --> 01:55:23,880
not only look and sound the same as they did on the original hardware, they also feel the same.

1251
01:55:24,920 --> 01:55:29,800
Provided that Nintendo actually does follow through on delivering enough units to stores,

1252
01:55:29,800 --> 01:55:36,600
I will say this, the SNES Classic absolutely is nostalgia done right at a fantastic value. And for

1253
01:55:36,600 --> 01:55:41,160
paying proper tribute to this fantastic piece of history, I believe they should be rewarded with

1254
01:55:41,160 --> 01:55:46,200
your $80. Your opinion may differ, but that is mine. No, I think, well, I think a lot of people

1255
01:55:46,200 --> 01:55:51,320
would like to reward them with their $80 except, you know, they can't. They can't because they

1256
01:55:51,320 --> 01:55:55,960
didn't make enough and we're in the same scalper situation again. That's a whole nother issue

1257
01:55:55,960 --> 01:56:00,440
though, but I, I respect what YYR is saying about, you know, if you can get your hands on one,

1258
01:56:00,440 --> 01:56:05,320
here's why to buy one. Here's what, you know, instead of going to, well, I could do that on a

1259
01:56:05,320 --> 01:56:10,680
Raspberry Pi, here's a reason why people want it. And I do agree with the controller part. Yes,

1260
01:56:10,680 --> 01:56:15,960
I'm well aware they make USB controllers that are really fucking similar, but you know what?

1261
01:56:16,040 --> 01:56:21,800
They don't really feel the same. Like a lot of those controllers really feel cheap when you use

1262
01:56:21,800 --> 01:56:27,240
them. I'm pretty sure that they have USB adapters for the original SNES controllers, NES controllers,

1263
01:56:27,240 --> 01:56:31,320
like you can use the original controller. Yes, that they do. That's cool. So, I mean,

1264
01:56:31,320 --> 01:56:39,000
there is ways to get around that, but yes, it is a brand new controller. It's just really short

1265
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:43,160
for some reason. They really, if they were smart, would have supported the Wii, you know,

1266
01:56:43,160 --> 01:56:48,280
be able to sync some Wii remotes to it. And then that way you could do it wirelessly since they're

1267
01:56:48,280 --> 01:56:55,160
just basically classic controllers anyways. Uh, Kaijuto in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says

1268
01:56:55,160 --> 01:57:01,320
SNES is 80 bucks. I thought it was 59.99. Surprise. The NES classic was 59.99, but yes,

1269
01:57:01,320 --> 01:57:06,440
the SNES classic is 79.99. It's okay. Cause they've changed absolutely fucking nothing.

1270
01:57:06,440 --> 01:57:11,720
Well, okay. Now to be fair, they do include two controllers. So that does kind of offset the cost

1271
01:57:11,720 --> 01:57:19,880
a bit with longer cords, slightly longer cords. Yeah. Not come barely, barely long enough to reach

1272
01:57:19,880 --> 01:57:24,920
the couch if I'm sitting in front of the couch, but not to actually reach the couch with me

1273
01:57:24,920 --> 01:57:29,800
sitting on it. Does that make sense? I don't understand why they can't make longer cords.

1274
01:57:29,800 --> 01:57:36,760
Is it a cost thing? Are they really just charge like $2 more? And then, I don't know. Anyway,

1275
01:57:36,760 --> 01:57:41,800
YYR continues. On a somewhat related note regarding the Wii shop shutdown. Now,

1276
01:57:41,800 --> 01:57:46,120
let it be said that I do not support piracy, especially considering that I create games

1277
01:57:46,120 --> 01:57:51,800
myself, but I'm sure you're already aware that the Wii console has already been hacked in every way

1278
01:57:51,800 --> 01:57:57,400
possible. Right, Loki? Uh, you may also know that using simple instructions is very easily to soft

1279
01:57:57,400 --> 01:58:02,520
mod your Wii and install things onto it. You may or may not, however, be aware that the entire

1280
01:58:02,600 --> 01:58:07,240
archive of Virtual Console and WiiWare is already available on the internet in large

1281
01:58:07,240 --> 01:58:12,120
archives and torrents. Now, I'm not going to suggest or endorse that anyone abuse this.

1282
01:58:12,120 --> 01:58:16,760
However, if something happens to your Wii console or its contents in the future,

1283
01:58:16,760 --> 01:58:22,280
it is very possible to get your previous purchase titles back. So when the Wii Shop channel goes

1284
01:58:22,280 --> 01:58:28,200
dark in 2019, none of its software will truly disappear for good. And that is a good thing,

1285
01:58:28,200 --> 01:58:33,800
because by the time you read this email, Xbox Live indie games will already be disappearing

1286
01:58:33,800 --> 01:58:38,440
forever. You know, it's funny. Yeah, there was, uh, I forget. It was someone from All Games. It

1287
01:58:38,440 --> 01:58:42,120
was Twitter, uh, tweeting on the All Games account. It was Derek. It was Derek. Yeah.

1288
01:58:42,120 --> 01:58:46,680
So Derek, I guess he had that, uh, you, you must die or you will die. He was like tweeting out

1289
01:58:46,680 --> 01:58:52,040
like codes and I was able to redeem one of them before they, before they shut it down. So Derek,

1290
01:58:52,040 --> 01:58:56,600
thank you. I don't know what the game is, but I've got it now. If I remember, I played it when

1291
01:58:56,600 --> 01:59:00,280
it first came out and it was, it was his little take on a bullet hell game, basically. That's

1292
01:59:00,280 --> 01:59:04,840
cool. I mean, yeah. I was like, Hey, free game. Cool. Yeah. Cause no, I mean, especially, you

1293
01:59:04,840 --> 01:59:11,320
know, for an indie game that I believe Derek did himself, uh, it was, it was good. It was a great

1294
01:59:11,320 --> 01:59:17,000
effort, you know, it's more than you've done. I'm just kidding. No, but no, it was, it was,

1295
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:21,720
it was great. It was great. So, uh, yeah, it's, it is sad that all that stuff's gone forever, but

1296
01:59:22,280 --> 01:59:28,040
I know that Xbox one has now its version of this and we've talked a little bit about that before.

1297
01:59:28,040 --> 01:59:35,560
And I know YYR is looking at maybe, you know, doing some of his games for that. Uh, and maybe

1298
01:59:35,560 --> 01:59:39,480
Derek will too. I don't know. I don't know if he's done with that or whatever, whatever he wants to

1299
01:59:39,480 --> 01:59:44,440
do and all your favorite creators over on Xbox live indie games. So steam now, because there's

1300
01:59:44,440 --> 01:59:48,760
really no barrier of the entry except for a hundred bucks. I don't have a hundred bucks.

1301
01:59:49,720 --> 01:59:53,880
You get it back. If you sell a thousand dollars, nobody's going to buy my game.

1302
01:59:53,880 --> 02:00:00,600
Maybe. So maybe the three people that listen to OLR, but that's about it. All right. Uh,

1303
02:00:00,600 --> 02:00:06,360
dark Tetsuya in chat says I saw a stream that was playing off some Xbox live indie game stuff.

1304
02:00:06,360 --> 02:00:12,440
It was mostly terrible jank, but still as a send off, have you, uh, have you been able to play any

1305
02:00:12,440 --> 02:00:16,600
of the Xbox live indie game stuff? Loki? Like I know you said you redeemed the code, but I

1306
02:00:16,600 --> 02:00:22,600
have not tried because that involves me actually hooking up my Xbox 360 again. And so I have not

1307
02:00:22,600 --> 02:00:28,600
done that to do, you know, all of that. Yeah. That's my problem too, is that the Xbox 360 is

1308
02:00:28,600 --> 02:00:33,800
not hooked up. But, um, my understanding is, and I hope I'm not getting this wrong. Somebody in chat

1309
02:00:33,800 --> 02:00:41,800
can correct me if I am wrong, but my understanding is that, uh, you, uh, can still download for like

1310
02:00:41,800 --> 02:00:47,880
another year. You just can't buy anything else, right? Yeah. I think that's the case. All right.

1311
02:00:47,880 --> 02:00:54,680
Well, Xbox live indie games is done and, uh, we're going to have to send off Xbox live indie games.

1312
02:00:54,680 --> 02:00:58,600
The only way I know how.

1313
02:00:58,600 --> 02:01:10,760
That's right. Play off Xbox live indie games keyboard cat.

1314
02:01:16,120 --> 02:01:19,400
Thank you very much. All right. Rest in peace forever in our hearts.

1315
02:01:20,200 --> 02:01:28,440
All right. Thank you YYR for the email. Let's move on with some more stories and, uh, you can

1316
02:01:28,440 --> 02:01:33,160
always email us as well. Participate at orange songs, radio.com. Tell us a favorite Xbox live

1317
02:01:33,160 --> 02:01:43,240
indie game story. Loki. Okay. Um, so basically the, uh, switch is doing really well. It's making

1318
02:01:43,240 --> 02:01:49,000
Nintendo lots of money. Who would have thought it prints money, prints money. Yes. So the, um,

1319
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:55,720
switch has actually caused and tender stocks to rise for a nine year high. Um, apparently they

1320
02:01:55,800 --> 02:02:03,720
are up 3.3% to a 43,930 yen. That's the highest they've been since September, 2008.

1321
02:02:04,520 --> 02:02:11,800
And apparently I still go on pretty strong. And along with that, of course, um, they're saying

1322
02:02:11,800 --> 02:02:17,640
that they're set to hit an annual annual, uh, shipment of switch consoles around the 20 million

1323
02:02:17,640 --> 02:02:23,240
mark. Um, along the, with that though, they're also saying that they're trying to increase

1324
02:02:23,240 --> 02:02:28,360
production. So they're going to be increasing the production by 2 million units per month

1325
02:02:28,360 --> 02:02:35,880
to hope to meet the demand through the holiday. So, um, neat. And then of course, along with

1326
02:02:35,880 --> 02:02:39,720
that, you know, they're also, is it still hard to get a switch easy? You know, it's,

1327
02:02:39,720 --> 02:02:45,720
it doesn't seem to be like I've seen them in stock in a few retail stores. They're not in stock

1328
02:02:45,720 --> 02:02:51,800
everywhere and all the time, but like I have gone into stores and seen a few systems sitting there.

1329
02:02:51,800 --> 02:02:57,880
So I don't think it's incredibly hard to get them, but they are out of stock in a lot of

1330
02:02:57,880 --> 02:03:02,280
places that would be good going into Christmas. There's a few on the shelf when, you know,

1331
02:03:02,280 --> 02:03:06,120
parents want to buy them for their kids. Like if I was to say, Julian's going to get his switch to

1332
02:03:06,120 --> 02:03:09,240
be able to play Zelda, if that's what he wants, I don't know. Like if I was going to, I'd probably

1333
02:03:09,240 --> 02:03:16,200
get that Mario's, uh, Odyssey bundle or something like that. Um, just, you know, they have Mario

1334
02:03:16,200 --> 02:03:22,680
Odyssey, but it's, I don't know. They're available. So, I mean, you can find them.

1335
02:03:22,680 --> 02:03:26,120
They're not like, I mean, there's still people trying to scalp them, which is like,

1336
02:03:26,120 --> 02:03:31,880
really late on that. It's kind of, they're out there. I mean, you're not going to need to sell

1337
02:03:31,880 --> 02:03:35,480
those guys thought they could wait until the holidays to make a bigger buck, but didn't work

1338
02:03:35,480 --> 02:03:40,520
out. All right. Well, I don't know if you've played any Fortnite battle royale. I've watched

1339
02:03:40,520 --> 02:03:45,240
a little bit of this on Twitch. Some of my buddies were playing on Twitch. I downloaded it with the

1340
02:03:45,240 --> 02:03:49,480
intention of playing with my friends, but I just, it hasn't happened yet. So I still haven't played

1341
02:03:49,480 --> 02:03:53,240
it. I just have the clients sitting there on my computer, but apparently this Fortnite battle

1342
02:03:53,240 --> 02:03:59,640
royale is doing pretty well, despite all the drama with, uh, pug B that we were talking about

1343
02:03:59,640 --> 02:04:05,240
the other week. Uh, or see, I know it's, I know it's pub G, but I like to say pug B is amazing

1344
02:04:05,240 --> 02:04:11,880
things, little pugs anyway. Uh, so anyway, unreal engine four is supposedly going to be getting some

1345
02:04:11,880 --> 02:04:18,680
tweaks to it to help support games like Fortnite battle royale, but it's not going to apply only

1346
02:04:18,680 --> 02:04:25,320
to Fortnite, which I think was part of the concerns that the developers of pug B had said

1347
02:04:25,320 --> 02:04:30,360
before is that, you know, that they were going to make improvements that only benefit that game. So

1348
02:04:30,360 --> 02:04:36,920
here is Epic games kind of doing something to the contrary, I suppose you could say. Uh, so anyhow,

1349
02:04:37,320 --> 02:04:41,720
dedicated servers will now support the larger number of players better, uh, with the change

1350
02:04:41,720 --> 02:04:46,760
log that they did. And, uh, some of the, I guess there's 60 Hertz servers, they get improvements

1351
02:04:46,760 --> 02:04:53,000
too. Uh, and so the level of detail system will allow for longer view distances, hopefully without

1352
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:57,800
sacrificing performance, which is especially important on consoles where you have a more

1353
02:04:57,800 --> 02:05:03,960
limited memory than you usually do on the PC. All these changes are supposed to be in version 4.18

1354
02:05:03,960 --> 02:05:10,920
of unreal engine four coming out later this month, although some will not be out till version 4.19.

1355
02:05:10,920 --> 02:05:15,000
So that's pretty cool. Uh, although you might be wondering, well, when do I get to do this on

1356
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:20,840
PlayStation four, at least doing the player unknown battlegrounds, the other, uh, game.

1357
02:05:20,840 --> 02:05:26,040
So if you do want to play yourself some pug B, uh, that is going to be coming out, hopefully on

1358
02:05:26,040 --> 02:05:30,280
PlayStation four, they haven't said anything official yet. Uh, the Xbox one version is later

1359
02:05:30,280 --> 02:05:35,640
this year, uh, and the game will be away from early access in 2018, getting its real release

1360
02:05:35,640 --> 02:05:42,920
on PC. Uh, but, uh, let's see the Xbox version will be launching later this year. And, uh, in a

1361
02:05:42,920 --> 02:05:48,520
statement from the blue holes, founder says that blue hole and Sony are thinking about a release

1362
02:05:48,520 --> 02:05:54,840
for the PlayStation four after that. So it may not be something exclusive to Microsoft's platform,

1363
02:05:54,840 --> 02:05:59,880
at least for very long. I would think though, this is the type of game, you know, I hope something

1364
02:06:00,040 --> 02:06:04,280
blue hole and the folks behind this game are thinking about. This is the type of game where

1365
02:06:04,280 --> 02:06:10,200
maybe they would have leverage to strong arm Sony and say, if you want us to put this game on your

1366
02:06:10,200 --> 02:06:15,000
console, you're going to let us do cross-play. And if Sony doesn't let them do it, they don't

1367
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:20,200
release it. I, I kind of would like to see that cause you know, not every game can get away with

1368
02:06:20,200 --> 02:06:25,720
that, but I think this is one where they might be able to, to arm wrestle Sony a little bit on that.

1369
02:06:25,720 --> 02:06:31,240
I hope they do. I don't know what their problem is. I don't either. And that,

1370
02:06:31,240 --> 02:06:35,080
that attitude is going to shoot them in the foot at some point. It is. I mean, cause it's like,

1371
02:06:35,080 --> 02:06:41,320
not really right now, but like looking at like, if I knew what I knew now with the consoles and

1372
02:06:41,320 --> 02:06:45,480
I'm going back and I'm like, okay, am I getting a PlayStation four and Xbox one and how they've

1373
02:06:45,480 --> 02:06:49,960
treated like modding and they've treated, you know, online plan stuff. I probably would have

1374
02:06:49,960 --> 02:06:56,600
gotten an Xbox one because you know, they're seem to be more open to that stuff. And that's

1375
02:06:56,600 --> 02:07:02,120
important. Kaijuto and chat over at live.vognetwork.com says Sony won't do it. That

1376
02:07:02,120 --> 02:07:05,960
game is still kind of not complete. Well, it's supposed to be complete in early 2018. That's

1377
02:07:05,960 --> 02:07:09,560
what they're saying. It will be out of early access by then. So a few more months to make all

1378
02:07:09,560 --> 02:07:15,880
those tweaks. We'll see. Anyway, uh, on a different note, let's talk about Assassin's Creed Origins,

1379
02:07:15,880 --> 02:07:19,960
because that is coming out later this month. We've got another huge game this month, right?

1380
02:07:19,960 --> 02:07:25,160
Well, some of the early previews are hitting out there on the internet and something that has come

1381
02:07:25,160 --> 02:07:30,040
out of the previews. This is very important and should be a feature that is weighed in many video

1382
02:07:30,040 --> 02:07:36,520
games that is out there. It has come out that in Assassin's Creed origin, you can pet the cats.

1383
02:07:36,520 --> 02:07:43,080
That's right. Everybody video gaming in 2017, we made it fam. You can pet the cats in Assassin's

1384
02:07:43,080 --> 02:07:49,320
Creed origin, which of course many people are very, very excited about. I guess that is a

1385
02:07:49,320 --> 02:07:56,120
fan requested feature that actually made it into the game. The development lead Ashraf Ismail,

1386
02:07:56,760 --> 02:08:02,600
who is the game director of Black Flag, said that fans were thanking him personally for ensuring

1387
02:08:02,600 --> 02:08:08,760
that the much requested petting feature was added back into the game. So I guess in an earlier

1388
02:08:08,760 --> 02:08:12,920
Assassin's Creed game, you could pet the animals, but then it wasn't there for the last one. So

1389
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:17,000
there you go. You will be able to pet cat. Yes, there's already YouTube

1390
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:22,520
gameplay, petting cats and Assassin's Creed origins. That's it's important. Loki. It's

1391
02:08:22,520 --> 02:08:26,680
important. They don't have it in Grand Theft Auto. You can only shoot the cats or drive.

1392
02:08:26,680 --> 02:08:35,240
That's terrible. Run them over the car. Oh, rock star. Fuck you. You should be able to pet the cat.

1393
02:08:35,240 --> 02:08:38,840
You should be able to pet the cat. You love the cat. Love every cat. It's all I want to

1394
02:08:38,840 --> 02:08:44,920
do in video games. That's my personal dream game. Love every cat. That's all you do. You

1395
02:08:44,920 --> 02:08:49,960
go around a big open world like Grand Theft Auto, and your goal is to pet all the cats.

1396
02:08:51,640 --> 02:08:57,000
That's it. Isn't that a game you'd play, Loki? No, that sounds terrible.

1397
02:08:57,000 --> 02:09:01,080
Why? Because cats don't want to be pet sometimes. They chase after them.

1398
02:09:01,720 --> 02:09:07,720
Let me love you. Is it like a parkour game like Assassin's Creed where you're like scaling walls

1399
02:09:07,720 --> 02:09:13,320
and running along? You have to stealthily approach the cat, and if the cat sees you,

1400
02:09:13,320 --> 02:09:16,760
it has the exclamation point and then runs away. You know what? That'd be super easy.

1401
02:09:16,760 --> 02:09:21,160
You just get a laser pointer and you just, okay. That could be like a superpower

1402
02:09:22,360 --> 02:09:27,880
that you get in the game. Tiger Claw in chat says you have to remember it's the cat's world.

1403
02:09:27,880 --> 02:09:32,600
We just live in it. That's right. All right. A couple more stories for you guys before we open

1404
02:09:32,600 --> 02:09:37,160
up the sky. Why don't we have a set? Who is it? A cat's in Creed or something like that where the

1405
02:09:37,160 --> 02:09:43,560
cat is the actual assassin. Does the game have a pause button? That was a joke. I would have

1406
02:09:43,560 --> 02:09:49,640
expected the 10 year old to tell, but he's not here. Anyway, Loki saved me before we open up the

1407
02:09:49,640 --> 02:09:56,920
Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio. So the everybody's message service is going to be opened up,

1408
02:09:56,920 --> 02:10:04,120
I guess, to help close out Miiverse. So since Miiverse is shutting down in November,

1409
02:10:05,400 --> 02:10:09,320
that they're basically allowing, I guess, the open, the everybody's message community,

1410
02:10:10,360 --> 02:10:16,040
which is going to last, I guess, for a week. And the logic is you're all messages and stuff. I

1411
02:10:16,040 --> 02:10:21,160
don't know. What the hell is this shit? I don't, I didn't ever use this. It sounds like it's just

1412
02:10:21,160 --> 02:10:27,640
a community on Miiverse to memorialize Miiverse. So somebody needs to go paint

1413
02:10:27,640 --> 02:10:30,840
a picture of Keyboard Cat to appropriately send off Miiverse.

1414
02:10:33,560 --> 02:10:38,760
All right. I mean, yeah, it's Loki. I get the feeling you don't plan on participating with

1415
02:10:38,760 --> 02:10:45,320
this. I don't fucking use Miiverse. You know what? Speaking of games, which game do you think

1416
02:10:45,400 --> 02:10:50,040
my son is playing on the Wii U? He's been just super hardcore into

1417
02:10:50,040 --> 02:10:55,160
Captain Toad's treasure game. We don't have that. Oh, well shit. I don't know that. What

1418
02:10:55,160 --> 02:11:00,120
Mario 64? Really? Yes. Out of all the games that I have downloaded for him,

1419
02:11:00,120 --> 02:11:05,960
he was playing Mario 64 like crazy. I don't see the problem. I don't either. It's just like,

1420
02:11:05,960 --> 02:11:09,480
I was surprised because he didn't want to play into the margins. I downloaded them all the

1421
02:11:09,480 --> 02:11:16,920
Mario games like Mario, Super Mario one through Super Mario World, right? Zelda, you know,

1422
02:11:16,920 --> 02:11:20,840
and all that stuff. And he didn't play any of those. And then Mario 64, he just decided

1423
02:11:20,840 --> 02:11:26,280
to play and he's been playing. Was this before or after you saw the kiosk with Mario Odyssey?

1424
02:11:26,840 --> 02:11:32,120
Cause I could see where a kid might draw some similarities before he's done it before.

1425
02:11:32,120 --> 02:11:36,600
Interesting. Yeah. Okay. He only played Mario Odyssey because it's a game to play at the store.

1426
02:11:36,920 --> 02:11:40,600
Right. Right. Right. Okay. I thought maybe like he did that and then it was like, Oh,

1427
02:11:40,600 --> 02:11:44,200
this is the closest thing I have at home to Mario Odyssey. Like, I don't know. Sometimes

1428
02:11:44,200 --> 02:11:48,360
no, I just, I hear the music all the time. Like I hear, you heard it from the other room

1429
02:11:49,960 --> 02:11:56,840
where he's playing like all this stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Pretty much. So does he die a lot in the

1430
02:11:56,840 --> 02:12:00,280
game? I don't know. I've never actually watched him play. I can just hear him playing from the

1431
02:12:00,280 --> 02:12:03,800
other room. How does the wife feel about that? Oh, she doesn't care as long as she's not,

1432
02:12:03,800 --> 02:12:08,680
he's not bothering. Exactly. Well, here's something you could let the kids play, uh,

1433
02:12:08,680 --> 02:12:14,200
just in time for its 25th anniversary. That's right. Do you know what game series turned 25

1434
02:12:14,200 --> 02:12:21,880
this week? Mortal combat. That's right. Mortal combat with a K turned 25 years old this week.

1435
02:12:21,880 --> 02:12:25,960
And, uh, yeah, they actually put out a little video that was on Twitter that was kind of

1436
02:12:25,960 --> 02:12:31,240
floating around, uh, about the mortal combat, uh, franchise and the legacy there, uh, the different

1437
02:12:31,240 --> 02:12:37,960
games in the series. The original game was 1992, 25 years ago, mortal combat arcade followed by

1438
02:12:37,960 --> 02:12:44,680
mortal combat two, three, ultimate mortal combat three, mortal combat trilogy, mortal combat four.

1439
02:12:44,680 --> 02:12:49,800
That mythology's game was sub-zero mortal combat gold, which was a dreamcast game,

1440
02:12:50,360 --> 02:12:55,320
mortal combat special forces. Then there was deadly Alliance tournament edition,

1441
02:12:55,320 --> 02:13:02,520
which was game boy advance deception Shaolin monks Armageddon was, that was the one with, uh,

1442
02:13:02,520 --> 02:13:06,440
like every fucking mortal combat character ever was Armageddon. Right. Because I think that was

1443
02:13:06,440 --> 02:13:12,360
the big send off of that. Uh, unchained was the PSP version. Ultimate mortal combat was the Nintendo

1444
02:13:12,360 --> 02:13:18,120
DS version. Then they had mortal combat versus DC universe, which was the brutality game. Right.

1445
02:13:18,120 --> 02:13:22,840
And then, uh, there was mortal combat 2001. I don't know which one that was. Oh, that was the

1446
02:13:22,840 --> 02:13:27,320
reboot, right? It was just called moral combat. It was called moral combat. And then a mortal

1447
02:13:27,320 --> 02:13:31,320
combat arcade collection, complete edition. Those were just, you know, greatest hits.

1448
02:13:31,320 --> 02:13:38,440
And then mortal combat X and XL. And, uh, that's where things stand. The last release was XL in

1449
02:13:38,440 --> 02:13:45,800
2016, which was really, you know, it was just a re re-box of X from 2015. So, you know, next year

1450
02:13:45,800 --> 02:13:54,600
will mark a, uh, three year gap between two. So, um, this year wasn't this year, the DC one. So

1451
02:13:55,400 --> 02:14:01,160
I would imagine the out of next year. Oh, injustice. Yeah. This year. Yeah. I would say

1452
02:14:01,160 --> 02:14:04,200
next year would be a good time for moral combat. Well, I don't know. There was mortal. It's actually

1453
02:14:04,200 --> 02:14:09,400
2011, not 2001. I don't know the years printed wrong here, but, uh, 2011 and 2015, that was a

1454
02:14:09,400 --> 02:14:15,560
four year difference. So I would say maybe 2019 to be the latest, but they might tease it before

1455
02:14:15,560 --> 02:14:21,480
that though. They also had, well, they had injustice one too. So that's true. I don't know.

1456
02:14:21,480 --> 02:14:25,240
Well, we'll see. Would you be excited for a new mortal combat game? I don't play them. So I don't

1457
02:14:26,040 --> 02:14:29,560
they, they're getting a little, they're getting a little violent for me. It's a little much like the

1458
02:14:29,560 --> 02:14:35,880
moral combat X was pretty intense. Gameplay is good. I mean, they keep upping the fatalities,

1459
02:14:35,880 --> 02:14:41,560
but it's just like kinda after a while. It's just, it's not that impressive. We're going to

1460
02:14:41,560 --> 02:14:46,440
open up the Skype line right now at orange lounge radio, all one word on Skype. If you want to do

1461
02:14:46,440 --> 02:14:50,360
it the old fashioned way, one eight seven seven game. O L R I would like to see them. Cause you

1462
02:14:50,360 --> 02:14:54,440
know how they deal with like the horror characters in there. I would like to see a horror character

1463
02:14:54,440 --> 02:14:59,000
licensed fighting game. Why not just do an all out like smash brothers, but all horror characters,

1464
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:04,360
Jason, Freddy, Jason, Ash predator, Ailey. I mean, most of these people are already in

1465
02:15:04,360 --> 02:15:08,200
leather face are already like side characters that they've added in all the games. You know,

1466
02:15:08,200 --> 02:15:11,880
we'll just do that. Yeah. The game. What's your earliest memory while we wait for some calls,

1467
02:15:11,880 --> 02:15:16,760
orange laundry on Skype. What's your earliest memory of a mortal combat moral combat one?

1468
02:15:16,760 --> 02:15:21,560
I mean, yeah. I remember going to the nickel arcade to play it where you had to pay the

1469
02:15:21,560 --> 02:15:25,960
two 50 to get in and then you play the games on the nickels. Yeah. I want to do a few of those.

1470
02:15:26,520 --> 02:15:30,360
There's fun. I wonder if we used to play in a nickel arcades. Geez. I don't even remember

1471
02:15:30,360 --> 02:15:36,680
anymore. It wasn't DDR cause that was before DDR. Um, that was the big one that there was

1472
02:15:36,680 --> 02:15:41,000
another like violent fighting games were all the rage around that year. Cause moral combat

1473
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:45,000
kind of pushed the envelope. There was that one. Was it time killers was the one where you chopped

1474
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:49,320
off the arms and legs and then eventually you could chop off the heads like that. And those

1475
02:15:49,320 --> 02:15:53,960
were literally the attack buttons you had like leg leg, hand, hand, maybe it was gauntlet or gauntlet

1476
02:15:53,960 --> 02:15:59,880
legacy or legends or whatever that we were playing. Yeah. Or you know what it was? It was a lot of

1477
02:15:59,880 --> 02:16:06,680
those like Capcom brawler games, you know, like the Simpsons arcade Ninja turtles. Oh sure.

1478
02:16:06,680 --> 02:16:11,800
That type of stuff. Konami. Yeah. Yeah. Well, Konami didn't do those turtles. Yeah. Oh yeah.

1479
02:16:11,800 --> 02:16:16,920
That was true. Yeah. That's right. Simpsons was on the same engine. Yeah. Yeah. Um, I'm thinking,

1480
02:16:16,920 --> 02:16:24,120
yeah. Captain commando and um, X-Men the X-Men arcade game. Yeah. Yeah. All of those. Cause those

1481
02:16:24,120 --> 02:16:30,120
final fight didn't play a whole lot of final fight. Really? Yeah. Just, um, I played captain

1482
02:16:30,120 --> 02:16:35,000
commando was like my favorite game. So I played that a ton. We had that. It was funny. Cause like

1483
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:39,080
when I was growing up, we had like an arcade game. Like they were, there's one of the seven 11

1484
02:16:39,080 --> 02:16:43,560
there's one at this other diner. There's one where the pizza place that was nearby had different

1485
02:16:43,560 --> 02:16:46,760
games. So if we wanted to go to different places to play different games, like yes,

1486
02:16:46,760 --> 02:16:54,600
refire two at the seven 11 and Kevin commando at this cafe and um, your Rico's pizza had like,

1487
02:16:54,600 --> 02:16:58,440
you know, a few different games, um, none of which were that great, super off road.

1488
02:16:58,440 --> 02:17:06,040
I remember they have that. Um, I don't know. I remember when mortal combat two first came out,

1489
02:17:06,040 --> 02:17:10,520
how fricking crazy everybody went. And like, I remember going to this little like quickie

1490
02:17:10,520 --> 02:17:14,120
Mart store. It wasn't actually seven 11, but something like it that actually had a mortal

1491
02:17:14,120 --> 02:17:17,800
combat two machine and like all the kids in the neighborhood were there because it was like the

1492
02:17:17,800 --> 02:17:21,880
graphics were insane. And I just remember seeing that for the first time when it was like one of

1493
02:17:21,880 --> 02:17:28,360
the fighters punched the other into the acid and that one stage it was nuts. So yeah, I think the

1494
02:17:28,360 --> 02:17:32,280
computer did it to him or something. Cause I don't, I don't know if people knew how to do

1495
02:17:32,280 --> 02:17:36,360
it right away. You know, you used to have to trade, you get them out of magazines or trade

1496
02:17:36,360 --> 02:17:41,160
them on BBSs to figure out how to do fatalities, fatalities and everything. And they used to have

1497
02:17:41,160 --> 02:17:46,440
guides or something. Exactly books. One last shout out for calls, uh, orange lounge radio,

1498
02:17:46,440 --> 02:17:51,160
all one word on Skype. Have you played any of the newer mortal combat? No, I still do. The only

1499
02:17:51,160 --> 02:17:56,920
thing I have that's recent is in the first injustice because that was one of the PlayStation

1500
02:17:56,920 --> 02:18:02,920
plus plus. Yeah. And so I still have to go back and play that. But no, I, I never really got into

1501
02:18:02,920 --> 02:18:08,920
moral combat as more street fighter. That's okay. I understand. Uh, I did, I played a little bit of

1502
02:18:08,920 --> 02:18:13,960
the mortal combat 2011 one cause I liked that it was kind of a re-imagining of the classic games

1503
02:18:13,960 --> 02:18:17,480
and that the story actually kind of went through the first three games. And you know,

1504
02:18:17,480 --> 02:18:21,560
I know the, the piece with my mother and her seeing that for the first time was, was pretty

1505
02:18:21,560 --> 02:18:25,960
legendary here on this show. But uh, yeah, you know, I, I, I, I enjoyed playing through that

1506
02:18:25,960 --> 02:18:28,760
game and then Alan got really into that game for a little bit too. He was playing it a lot.

1507
02:18:28,760 --> 02:18:33,320
He played through the story. So I mean, I'll give mortal combat that it usually had a pretty good

1508
02:18:33,320 --> 02:18:37,080
story and I liked how they have like in a lot of the like PlayStation two and later games,

1509
02:18:37,080 --> 02:18:41,960
they have like the crypt, which had like 11 billion unlocks in it. Right. Like all the

1510
02:18:41,960 --> 02:18:46,920
different colors and art and music and like everything. So I always was pretty impressed

1511
02:18:46,920 --> 02:18:52,680
with that go cart game and yeah. Uh, dungeon buster in our chat over at live.vog network.com

1512
02:18:52,680 --> 02:18:57,960
says Genesis with the blood code. Oh, remember how Epic that was when the blood code came out

1513
02:18:57,960 --> 02:19:02,840
for the Genesis that you could actually enable the blood cause the super ninja I had the super

1514
02:19:03,800 --> 02:19:09,640
version for you can change with the game G. You could change the color, but you could not

1515
02:19:10,200 --> 02:19:15,880
suddenly change sub zeros fatality back like that, that those sprites with the severed heads

1516
02:19:15,880 --> 02:19:20,760
and stuff, they were just not in the cartridge. Right. So you could not re-enable the original

1517
02:19:20,760 --> 02:19:26,280
fatalities. It just was not in the programming at all. So unfortunately the newer fatalities are

1518
02:19:26,280 --> 02:19:31,240
always really lame. Like didn't Johnny cages just become like an uppercut and that was like

1519
02:19:31,240 --> 02:19:38,120
the fatality. I don't even remember. Like, uh, sub-zero froze the guy and then it shattered

1520
02:19:38,120 --> 02:19:42,840
into ice cubes, which I guess that was, that was, that's still kind of violent, but you have to kind

1521
02:19:42,840 --> 02:19:47,400
of infer a lot of the violence, but for some reason they left Sonia's the same Sonia and

1522
02:19:47,400 --> 02:19:52,680
scorpion. They never changed because there's wasn't blood. It was fire and setting somebody

1523
02:19:52,680 --> 02:20:00,440
on fire was fine. This is weird Nintendo logic in the nineties where as long as you don't see blood,

1524
02:20:00,440 --> 02:20:05,160
it's fine. But if somebody is, you know, vaporized, then you don't see blood. So it's fine.

1525
02:20:05,960 --> 02:20:11,240
So, and then they changed. What else did they change? They changed like, uh, uh, what was the

1526
02:20:11,240 --> 02:20:17,080
other really violent one in that game was like, Oh, like Kano used to rip out the heart. Right.

1527
02:20:17,080 --> 02:20:22,040
So instead it just looked like Kano did a tummy tickle and they died because there would be no

1528
02:20:22,040 --> 02:20:31,000
heart twister titty twister. All right. Well, sadly the phones aren't lighting up. I guess,

1529
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:35,720
uh, people feel that they cannot follow Julian tonight, which I don't, uh, I don't blame them.

1530
02:20:35,720 --> 02:20:40,200
He's a pretty, he's a pretty hard act to follow. And also, uh, I think rage nators not here

1531
02:20:40,200 --> 02:20:44,360
tonight. I hope he's okay. He usually calls in right away, but I don't even see him in chat

1532
02:20:44,360 --> 02:20:50,760
tonight. He left earlier. Yeah. So, all right. Well, anyhow, uh, that's going to do it for

1533
02:20:50,760 --> 02:20:54,920
another episode of orange lounge radio tonight. Thank you guys so much for listening to our show

1534
02:20:54,920 --> 02:20:59,160
this week. We really appreciate it. Uh, but I think, uh, I think that's going to do it. We'll

1535
02:20:59,160 --> 02:21:03,320
be back here in seven days. Do it all again. As we get closer to Halloween, we can talk a little

1536
02:21:03,320 --> 02:21:09,640
more about scary games. Maybe we'll stream some more or something like that. Uh, but for now,

1537
02:21:09,640 --> 02:21:13,000
we're going to leave you with, uh, this message. If you enjoyed what you heard here at orange

1538
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:16,840
lounge radio tonight, tell a friend or two about the show. Help us spread the word because we are

1539
02:21:16,840 --> 02:21:22,360
the show where every gamer has a voice, but only if those voices are out there to be heard.

1540
02:21:22,360 --> 02:21:26,440
See now is when you need to like stream all the anymore scary games for PlayStation VR. Well,

1541
02:21:26,440 --> 02:21:33,000
I guess they have Russia bloods. All right. I mean, but like, um, I don't need to play scary

1542
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:37,560
games. The blood is awesome. That is like my favorite PlayStation VR game. Although I have,

1543
02:21:37,560 --> 02:21:42,600
I still have to go and I just don't want to set it up. I just, I just, I still need to go and play,

1544
02:21:42,600 --> 02:21:47,400
um, super hot cause I have super hot VR. Okay. I got to make a point this week to play super hot

1545
02:21:47,400 --> 02:21:52,120
VR. That game was the, I liked watching a Bobby and his friends play that game cause they had that

1546
02:21:52,120 --> 02:21:57,800
at dragon con. Bobby set that all up and that looks awesome. But I know there's more VR games

1547
02:21:57,800 --> 02:22:03,640
coming soon. I have to kind of check in there and see what they have available now. Um, but yeah,

1548
02:22:03,640 --> 02:22:09,080
we need more scary games on there. Like I know that they have, um, on Oculus survivor or something

1549
02:22:09,080 --> 02:22:15,080
like that. It was the, uh, like a room which I figured it was like a chair in a room or

1550
02:22:15,080 --> 02:22:18,360
something like that. I figured it's called something simple like that where you're sitting

1551
02:22:18,360 --> 02:22:24,760
on a chair and creepy shit happens and Oh yeah. It was like resident evil seven. No, not that one.

1552
02:22:25,400 --> 02:22:28,360
No, it's like literally called like a room with a chair or something like that. I don't remember

1553
02:22:28,360 --> 02:22:33,640
what it's called. Well anyway, speaking of dragon Congress, I mentioned that a minute ago. Y'all

1554
02:22:34,280 --> 02:22:38,920
make plans for dragon con next year. It's going to be awesome because it's not just like

1555
02:22:39,800 --> 02:22:45,400
by black off, we'll be there. But guess what? Travis Donovan's coming back next year. I knew

1556
02:22:45,400 --> 02:22:50,440
he wouldn't stay gone forever and I'm so happy that he'll be back. Uh, next year he's making

1557
02:22:50,440 --> 02:22:55,880
his plans to do that. So that's really exciting. So dragon con 2018 make it happen. Oh, there is

1558
02:22:55,880 --> 02:23:02,040
another game I saw. Um, you should actually pick up on, it's um, done by my, one of my favorite,

1559
02:23:02,920 --> 02:23:09,960
um, favorite developers, uh, that does like cluster truck and all that stuff. Um,

1560
02:23:10,680 --> 02:23:15,720
but they did a new stick fighting game. So it's like two stick figures and you're fighting,

1561
02:23:16,520 --> 02:23:19,560
but it's like the levels keep getting crazier and crazier as you go along.

1562
02:23:20,120 --> 02:23:24,360
And it's like five bucks on steam right now. I think it's like stick wars or something like that.

1563
02:23:24,360 --> 02:23:29,800
But, um, definitely check it out. It's by landfall games. Okay. And I watched, uh,

1564
02:23:29,800 --> 02:23:34,200
watched the stream of that and it looked hilarious. It would be totally a game that

1565
02:23:34,200 --> 02:23:40,200
I think you guys would dig. All right. Thanks. I'm a wishlist. Well, let's get final thoughts

1566
02:23:40,200 --> 02:23:43,720
and then we're going to call it a night here at, uh, the voice geeks network. Loki,

1567
02:23:43,720 --> 02:23:47,160
your final thought tonight. Yeah. Sick fight. The game was the name of that. Um,

1568
02:23:47,160 --> 02:23:52,520
my final thought is sorry. Haven't been working on programming because unfortunately I am knee

1569
02:23:52,520 --> 02:23:59,160
deep in fucking Lego addiction. So, um, I don't know what to do. And I gotta, I gotta go through

1570
02:23:59,160 --> 02:24:04,920
this phase and then we'll, we'll see how that happens. It's not going to get better though.

1571
02:24:05,560 --> 02:24:09,640
It's going to get worse before it gets better. And then my final thought is, sorry, I haven't

1572
02:24:09,640 --> 02:24:13,960
been streaming cause of psychological online game addiction. So, but I'm going to do a stream

1573
02:24:13,960 --> 02:24:17,720
tonight. So stay tuned for that. I'll tell you more about that after the credits here,

1574
02:24:17,720 --> 02:24:21,160
but for everybody, uh, thanks for listening. We'll be back to do it in seven days.

1575
02:24:21,160 --> 02:24:25,240
